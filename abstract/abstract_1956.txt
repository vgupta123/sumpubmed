BACKGROUND
perioperative lidocaine treatment is commonly used in horses that undergo surgical treatment of colic, to prevent or treat postoperative ileus and reduce the effects of intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion injury. however, its clinical efficacy has not been evaluated in a large population of horses undergoing small intestinal surgery. the aim of the current study was to evaluate whether systemic lidocaine administration reduced the prevalence, volume and duration of postoperative reflux and improved rates of survival following surgical treatment of small intestinal lesions. data were collected as a part of two prospective studies investigating postoperative survival of surgical colic patients admitted to a uk equine referral hospital during the periods 2004– <dig> and 2012– <dig>  kaplan-meier plots of cumulative probability of survival and the log-rank test were used to compare survival between horses that did or did not receive lidocaine. the wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the total reflux volume and duration of reflux between the groups. a multivariable cox proportional hazards model was used to identify pre- and intraoperative risk factors for non-survival.


RESULTS
data from  <dig> horses were included in the final analysis. the overall prevalence of postoperative reflux was  <dig>  %. this was significantly higher  in horses admitted in 2012– <dig> compared to the 2004– <dig> cohort . perioperative lidocaine treatment had no effect on total reflux volume, duration of reflux or rates of postoperative survival nor was it a risk factor associated with altered postoperative survival. variables identified to be associated with increased risk of postoperative mortality included packed cell volume on admission , heart rate on admission  and duration of surgery .


CONCLUSIONS
lidocaine therapy had no effect on the prevalence of postoperative reflux, total reflux volume and duration of reflux nor did it have any effect on postoperative survival in horses undergoing surgical management of small intestinal disease for treatment of colic. there is a need for a well-designed multicentre, prospective randomised controlled trial to fully investigate the efficacy of lidocaine across different hospital populations.
