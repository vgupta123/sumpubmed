BACKGROUND
chamydophila pneumoniae  and/or mycoplasma pneumoniae  are two bacteria detected in vulnerable atheromas. in this study we aimed to analyze whether cp and/or mp aggravates atherosclerosis induced by cholesterol-enriched diet in c57bl/ <dig> apoe ko male mice. thirty male apoe ko mice aged eight weeks fed by a diet containing 1% cholesterol until  <dig> weeks of age were divided into four groups: the first was inoculated with cp , the second with mp , the third with both cp + mp , and the fourth with saline . the animals were re-inoculated at  <dig> weeks of age, and sacrificed at  <dig> weeks of age. two ascending aorta and one aortic arch segments were sampled. in the most severely obstructed segment, vessel diameter, plaque height, percentage of luminal obstruction and the degree of adventitial inflammation were analyzed. the plaque area/intimal surface ratio was obtained by measuring all three segments. the adventitial inflammation was semiquantified .


RESULTS
the mean and standard deviation of plaque height, % luminal obstruction, external diameter, the plaque area/intimal surface ratio and the adventitial inflammation values are the following for each group: mp , cp , mp + cp  and sham . a wider area of plaque/intimal surface was observed in mp + cp inoculated groups  as well as an increased plaque height in cp  in comparison with sham group. there was also an increased luminal obstruction  in cp inoculated group in comparison to sham group. adventitial inflammation in mp + cp inoculated group was higher than mp, cp and the sham groups .


CONCLUSIONS
inoculation of cp, mp or both agents in c57bl/ <dig> apoe ko male mice caused aggravation of experimental atherosclerosis induced by cholesterol-enriched diet, with distinct characteristics. cp inoculation increased the plaque height with positive vessel remodeling and co-inoculation of mp + cp caused the highest adventitial inflammation measures.
