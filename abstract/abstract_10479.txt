BACKGROUND
the first telomerase-associated protein  was isolated in yeast due to its essential role in telomere maintenance. the human counterparts est1a, est1b, and est1c perform diverse functions in nonsense-mediated mrna decay , telomere length homeostasis, and telomere transcription. although est <dig> and est1a/b interact with the catalytic subunit of yeast and human telomerase , the molecular determinants of these interactions have not been elaborated fully.


RESULTS
to investigate the functional conservation of the est <dig> protein family, we performed protein-protein interaction mapping and structure-function analysis. the domain in hest1a most conserved between species, containing a tpr , was sufficient for interaction of hest1a with multiple fragments of htert including the n-terminus. two mutations within the htert n-terminus that perturb in vivo function  did not affect this protein interaction. scest <dig> hybrids containing the tpr of hest1a, hest1b, or hest1c were expressed in yeast strains lacking est <dig>  yet they failed to complement senescence. point mutations within and outside the cognate scest <dig> tpr, chosen to disrupt a putative protein interaction surface, resulted in telomere lengthening or shortening without affecting recruitment to telomeres.


CONCLUSIONS
these results identify a domain encompassing the tpr of hest1a as an htert interaction module. the tpr of s. cerevisiae est <dig> is required for telomerase-mediated telomere length maintenance in a manner that appears separable from telomere recruitment. discrete residues in or adjacent to the tpr of est <dig> also regulate telomere length homeostasis.
