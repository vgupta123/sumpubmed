BACKGROUND
segmental duplications  commonly exist in plant and animal genomes, playing crucial roles in genomic rearrangement, gene innovation and the formation of copy number variants. however, they have received little attention in most livestock species.


RESULTS
aiming at characterizing sds across the genomes of diverse livestock species, we mapped genome-wide sds of horse, rabbit, goat, sheep and chicken, and also enhanced the existing sd maps of cattle and pig genomes based on the most updated genome assemblies. we adopted two different detection strategies, whole genome analysis comparison and whole genome shotgun sequence detection, to pursue more convincing findings. accordingly we identified sds for each species with the length of from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb, and  <dig> to  <dig>  genes were harboured within the sd regions across different species. more interestingly, many of these sd-related genes were involved in the process of immunity and response to external stimuli. we also found the existence of  <dig> common genes within sd regions in all studied species except goat. these common genes mainly consisted of both udp glucuronosyltransferase and interferon alpha families, implying the connection between sds and the evolution of these gene families.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings provide insights into livestock genome evolution and offer rich genomic sources for livestock genomic research.
