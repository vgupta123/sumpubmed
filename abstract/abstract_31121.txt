BACKGROUND
the glun2b subunit of the n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor  modulates many physiological processes including learning, memory, and pain. excessive increase in nmdar/glun2b activity has been associated with various disorders such neuropathic pain and neuronal death following hypoxia. thus there is an interest in identifying nmdar antagonists that interact specifically with the glun2b subunit. recently based on structural analysis between the glun2b subunit and conantokin-g, a toxin that interacts selectively with the glun2b subunit, we designed various peptides that are predicted to act as nmdar antagonists by interacting with the glun2b subunit. in this study we tested this prediction for two of these peptides ear <dig> and ear <dig> 


RESULTS
the effects of ear <dig> and ear <dig> in nmda-evoked currents were measured in cultured rat embryonic hippocampal neurons and in hek- <dig> cells expressing recombinant nmdar comprised of glun1a–glun2a or glun1a–glun2b subunits. in hippocampal neurons, ear <dig> and ear <dig> reduced the nmda-evoked calcium currents in a dose-dependent and reversible manner with comparable ic <dig>  values of  <dig> and 176 µm, respectively. at 500 µm, ear <dig> blocked more strongly the nmda-evoked currents mediated by the glun1a–glun2b  than those mediated by the glun1a–glun2a  subunits. at 500 µm, ear <dig> blocked to a similar extent the nmda-evoked currents mediated by the glun1a–glun2b  and the glun1a–glun2a  subunits.


CONCLUSIONS
the newly designed ear <dig> and ear <dig> peptides were shown to block in reversible manner nmda-evoked currents, and ear <dig> showed a stronger selectivity for glun2b than for glun2a.
