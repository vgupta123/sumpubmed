BACKGROUND
the beta-defensin gene cluster  at chromosome 8p <dig>  is one of the most copy number  variable regions of the human genome. whereas individual defb cns have been suggested as independent genetic risk factors for several diseases , the role of multisite sequence variations  is less well understood and to date has only been reported for prostate cancer. simultaneous assessment of msvs and cns can be achieved by pcr, cloning and sanger sequencing, however, these methods are labour and cost intensive as well as prone to methodological bias introduced by bacterial cloning. here, we demonstrate that amplicon sequencing of pooled individual pcr products by the  <dig> technology allows in-depth determination of msv haplotypes and estimation of defb cns in parallel.


RESULTS
six pcr products spread over ~ <dig> kb of defb and harbouring  <dig> known msvs were amplified from  <dig> dna samples, pooled and sequenced on a roche  <dig> gs flx sequencer. from ~ <dig>  reads, ~ <dig>  haplotype calls  were inferred that identified  <dig> haplotypes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> per amplicon. in addition to the  <dig> known msvs, two additional sequence variations were detected. minimal cns were estimated from the ratio of hcs and compared to absolute cns determined by alternative methods. concordance in cns was found for  <dig> samples, the cns differed by one in  <dig> samples and the estimated minimal cn was half of the absolute in one sample. for  <dig> samples and  <dig> amplicons, the  <dig> haplotyping results were compared to those by cloning/sanger sequencing. intrinsic problems related to chimera formation during pcr and differences between haplotyping by  <dig> and cloning/sanger sequencing are discussed.


CONCLUSIONS
deep amplicon sequencing using the  <dig> technology yield thousands of hcs per amplicon for an affordable price and may represent an effective method for parallel haplotyping and cn estimation in small to medium-sized cohorts. the obtained haplotypes represent a valuable resource to facilitate further studies of the biomedical impact of highly cn variable loci such as the beta-defensin locus.
