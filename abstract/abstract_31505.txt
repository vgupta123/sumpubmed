BACKGROUND
as a key player in suppression of colon tumorigenesis, adenomatous polyposis coli  has been widely studied to determine its cellular functions. however, inconsistencies of commercially available apc antibodies have limited the exploration of apc function. apc is implicated in spindle formation by direct interactions with tubulin and microtubule-binding protein eb <dig>  apc also interacts with the actin cytoskeleton to regulate cell polarity. until now, interaction of apc with the third cytoskeletal element, intermediate filaments, has remained unexamined.


RESULTS
we generated an apc antibody  raised against the  <dig> amino acid repeat region, and verified its reliability in applications including immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence in cultured cells and tissue. utilizing this apc-m <dig> pab, we immunoprecipitated endogenous apc and its binding proteins from colon epithelial cells expressing wild-type apc. using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry , we identified  <dig> proteins in complex with apc, including Î²-catenin and intermediate filament  proteins lamin b <dig> and keratin  <dig>  association of lamin b <dig> with apc in cultured cells and human colonic tissue was verified by co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization. apc also colocalized with keratins and remained associated with if proteins throughout a sequential extraction procedure.


CONCLUSIONS
we introduce a versatile apc antibody that is useful for cell/tissue immunostaining, immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. we also present evidence for interactions between apc and ifs, independent of actin filaments and microtubules. our results suggest that apc associates with all three major components of the cytoskeleton, thus expanding potential roles for apc in the regulation of cytoskeletal integrity.
