BACKGROUND
adenylate kinase  <dig>  is a phosphotransferase that catalyzes the reversible reaction 2adp ↔ atp + amp and influences cellular energy homeostasis. however, the role of ak <dig> in regulating cell proliferation remains unclear because ak <dig> has been reported to be involved in either cell proliferation or cell apoptosis in different cell types of various organisms.


RESULTS
this study reports ak <dig> promotion of cell proliferation using the lepidopteran insect helicoverpa armigera and its epidermal cell line haepi as models. western blot analysis indicates that ak <dig> constitutively expresses in various tissues during larval development. immunocytochemistry analysis indicates that ak <dig> localizes in the mitochondria. the recombinant expressed ak <dig> in e. coli promotes cell growth and viability of haepi cell line by 3-- <dig>  5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide  assay. ak <dig> knockdown in larvae by rna interference causes larval growth defects, including body weight decrease and development delay. ak <dig> knockdown in larvae also decreases the number of circulating haemocytes. the mechanism for such effects might be the suppression of gene transcription involved in insect development caused by ak <dig> knockdown.


CONCLUSIONS
these results show that ak <dig> regulates cell growth, viability, and proliferation in insect growth and development.
