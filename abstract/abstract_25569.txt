BACKGROUND
r2r <dig> myb proteins constitute one of the largest plant transcription factor clades and regulate diverse plant-specific processes. several r2r <dig> myb proteins act as regulators of secondary cell wall  biosynthesis in arabidopsis thaliana , a dicotyledenous plant. relatively few studies have examined scw r2r <dig> myb function in grasses, which may have diverged from dicots in terms of scw regulatory mechanisms, as they have in cell wall composition and patterning. understanding cell wall regulation is especially important for improving lignocellulosic bioenergy crops, such as switchgrass.


RESULTS
here, we describe the results of applying phylogenic, orthomcl, and sequence identity analyses to classify the r2r <dig> myb family proteins from the annotated proteomes of arabidposis, poplar, rice, maize and the initial genome  and translated transcriptome of switchgrass . we find that the r2r <dig> myb proteins of the five species fall into  <dig> subgroups, including three dicot-specific, six grass-specific, and two panicoid grass-expanded subgroups. we observe four classes of phylogenetic relationships within the subgroups of known scw-regulating myb proteins between arabidopsis and rice, ranging from likely one-to-one orthology  to no homologs identifiable . microarray data for putative switchgrass scw mybs indicate that many maintain similar expression patterns with the arabidopsis scw regulators. however, some of the switchgrass-expanded candidate scw mybs exhibit differences in gene expression patterns among paralogs, consistent with subfunctionalization. furthermore, some switchgrass representatives of grass-expanded clades have gene expression patterns consistent with regulating scw development.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis suggests that no single comparative genomics tool is able to provide a complete picture of the r2r <dig> myb protein family without leaving ambiguities, and establishing likely false-negative and -positive relationships, but that used together a relatively clear view emerges. generally, we find that most r2r <dig> mybs that regulate scw in arabidopsis are likely conserved in the grasses. this comparative analysis of the r2r <dig> myb family will facilitate transfer of understanding of regulatory mechanisms among species and enable control of scw biosynthesis in switchgrass toward improving its biomass quality.
