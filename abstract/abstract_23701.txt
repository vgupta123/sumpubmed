BACKGROUND
porcine proliferative enteropathy caused by lawsonia intracellularis  is a major concern to the pig industry worldwide. although  <dig>  billion pigs are produced each year in china, few reports on the prevalence of l.intracellularis infection are available. the aim of the current study was to estimate the seroprevalence of l. intracellularis antibodies in intensive pig farms in china.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> serum samples were collected from  <dig> commercial pig farms located throughout china. animals from all age groups were sampled including pre-weaning piglets, weaners, fattening pigs, adult sows and boars. antibodies against l. intracellularis were detected using a specific blocking elisa. of the  <dig> serum samples,  <dig> were identified as positive using the elisa test. the apparent seroprevalence of l. intracellularis seropositivity was 57% . the true prevalence  was 77% .


CONCLUSIONS
the highest true prevalence was observed in sows and boars, suggesting that within a herd these stock classes are a reservoir for infection. the prevalence of l. intracellularis seropositivity in local breed pigs was significantly less than that in imported breeds. a higher seroprevalence was found in pigs in herds in central and northern china, which may correspond to the greater use of the intensive production systems in these areas. we conclude that l. intracellularis is widely prevalent in commercial pigs in china.
