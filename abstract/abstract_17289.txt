BACKGROUND
hepatoma derived growth factor  is a nuclear protein with nuclear targeting required for mitogenic activity. recently we demonstrated that hdgf is a transcriptional repressor, but whether hdgf binds dna, the specificity of dna binding and what protein domain is required are still unknown. in this study, we aimed to identify if hdgf is a dna binding protein, map the functional dna binding domain and dna binding element for hdgf.


RESULTS
using chromatin immunoprecipitation  of human dna, we isolated  <dig> dna sequences sharing a conserved ~ <dig> bp element. homology analysis identified the binding sequences as a motif within the promoter of the smyd <dig> gene, a hdgf target gene. electrophoretic mobility shift assays  confirmed the binding of hdgf to this conserved sequence. as a result, an  <dig> bp conserved sequence located in the smyd <dig> promoter bound gst-hdgf tightly. the binding core sequence for hdgf was narrowed down to  <dig> bp using a deletion mapping strategy from both the 5' and 3' ends. moreover, chip and dnase i footprinting analysis revealed that hdgf binds this  <dig> bp dna fragment specifically. functionally overexpression of hdgf represses a reporter gene which is controlled by an sv- <dig> promoter containing the  <dig> bp dna element. using serial truncations of gst-hdgf, we mapped the dna binding domain of hdgf to the n-terminal pwwp domain.


CONCLUSIONS
hdgf is a dna binding protein, binds dna specifically, and prefers a minimum of  <dig> bp long dna fragment. the n-terminal pwwp domain of hdgf is required for dna binding. hdgf exerts its transcription repressive effect through binding to a conserved dna element in the promoter of target genes.
