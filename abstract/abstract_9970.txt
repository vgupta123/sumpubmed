BACKGROUND
the horn fly, haematobia irritans   is one of the most important ectoparasites of pastured cattle. horn flies infestations reduce cattle weight gain and milk production. additionally, horn flies are mechanical vectors of different pathogens that cause disease in cattle. the aim of this study was to conduct a functional genomics study in female horn flies using expressed sequence tags  analysis and rna interference .


RESULTS
a cdna library was made from whole abdominal tissues collected from partially fed adult female horn flies. high quality horn fly ests  were sequenced and assembled into  <dig> unigenes  representing molecular functions such as serine proteases, cell metabolism, mitochondrial function, transcription and translation, transport, chromatin structure, vitellogenesis, cytoskeleton, dna replication, cell response to stress and infection, cell proliferation and cell-cell interactions, intracellular trafficking and secretion, and development. functional analyses were conducted using rnai for the first time in horn flies. gene knockdown by rnai resulted in higher horn fly mortality , reduced oviposition  or both  when compared to controls. silencing of ubiquitination ests did not affect horn fly mortality and ovisposition while gene knockdown in the ferritin and vatpse functional groups reduced mortality when compared to controls.


CONCLUSIONS
these results advanced the molecular characterization of this important ectoparasite and suggested candidate protective antigens for the development of vaccines for the control of horn fly infestations.
