BACKGROUND
the key enzymes of photosynthetic carbon assimilation in c <dig> plants have evolved independently several times from c <dig> isoforms that were present in the c <dig> ancestral species. the c <dig> isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase , the primary co2-fixing enzyme of the c <dig> cycle, is specifically expressed at high levels in mesophyll cells of the leaves of c <dig> species. we are interested in understanding the molecular changes that are responsible for the evolution of this c4-characteristic pepc expression pattern, and we are using the genus flaveria  as a model system. it is known that cis-regulatory sequences for mesophyll-specific expression of the ppca <dig> gene of f. trinervia  are located within a distal promoter region .


RESULTS
in this study we focus on the proximal region  of the ppca <dig> promoter of f. trinervia and present an analysis of its function in establishing a c4-specific expression pattern. we demonstrate that the pr harbours cis-regulatory determinants which account for high levels of pepc expression in the leaf. our results further suggest that an intron in the 5' untranslated leader region of the pr is not essential for the control of ppca <dig> gene expression.


CONCLUSIONS
the allocation of cis-regulatory elements for enhanced expression levels to the proximal region of the ppca <dig> promoter provides further insight into the regulation of pepc expression in c <dig> leaves.
