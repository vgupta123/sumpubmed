BACKGROUND
receptor-interacting protein  <dig> , a member of rip family proteins, has been shown to participate in programmed necrosis or necroptosis in cell biology studies. evidence suggests that necroptosis may be a mode of neuronal death in the retina.


RESULTS
in the present study we determined the expression of rip <dig> in normal rat retina and its changes following acute high intraocular pressure . rip <dig> immunoreactivity  was largely present in the inner retinal layers, localized to subsets of cells expressing neuron-specific nuclear antigen , parvalbumin and calbindin in the ganglion cell layer  and inner nuclear layer . no double labeling was detected for rip <dig> with pkc-Î± or rhodopsin. rip <dig> immunoreactivity was increased in the gcl at  <dig> hr and  <dig> hr, but reduced at  <dig> hr in the retina, without apparent alteration in laminar or cellular distribution pattern. western blot analysis confirmed the above time-dependent alteration in rip <dig> protein expression. rip <dig> expressing cells frequently co-localized with propidium iodide . a few co-localized cells were observed between rip <dig> and bax or cleaved caspase- <dig> in the gcl in  <dig> hr following ahiop.


CONCLUSIONS
the results indicate that rip <dig> is expressed differentially in retinal neurons in adult rats, including subsets of ganglion cells, amacrine and horizontal cells. rip <dig> protein levels are elevated rapidly following ahiop. rip <dig> labeling co-localized with pi, bax or cleaved caspase- <dig> among cells in the ganglion cell layer following ahiop, which suggest its involvement of rip <dig> in neuronal responses to acute ischemic insults.
