BACKGROUND
many β-strands are not flat but bend and/or twist. however, although almost all β-strands have a twist, not all have a bend, suggesting that the underlying force driving β-strand bending is distinct from that for the twist. we, therefore, investigated the physical origin of β-strand bends.

methods
we calculated rotation, twist and bend angles for a four-residue short frame. fixed-length fragments consisting of six residues found in three consecutive short frames were used to evaluate the twist and bend angles of full-length β-strands.


RESULTS
we calculated and statistically analyzed the twist and bend angles of β-strands found in globular proteins with known three-dimensional structures. the results show that full-length β-strand bend angles are related to the nearby aromatic residue content, whereas local bend angles are related to the nearby aliphatic residue content. furthermore, it appears that β-strands bend to maximize their hydrophobic contacts with an abutting hydrophobic surface or to form a hydrophobic side-chain cluster when an abutting hydrophobic surface is absent.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the dominant driving force for full-length β-strand bends is the hydrophobic interaction involving aromatic residues, whereas that for local β-strand bends is the hydrophobic interaction involving aliphatic residues.
