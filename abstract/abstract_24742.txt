BACKGROUND
the extant squamates  are one of the most diverse and conspicuous radiations of terrestrial vertebrates, but no studies have attempted to reconstruct a phylogeny for the group with large-scale taxon sampling. such an estimate is invaluable for comparative evolutionary studies, and to address their classification. here, we present the first large-scale phylogenetic estimate for squamata.


RESULTS
the estimated phylogeny contains  <dig> species, representing all currently recognized families and subfamilies. the analysis is based on up to  <dig> base pairs of sequence data per species  from  <dig> genes, including seven nuclear loci , and five mitochondrial genes . the tree provides important confirmation for recent estimates of higher-level squamate phylogeny based on molecular data , estimates that are very different from previous morphology-based hypotheses. the tree also includes many relationships that differ from previous molecular estimates and many that differ from traditional taxonomy.


CONCLUSIONS
we present a new large-scale phylogeny of squamate reptiles that should be a valuable resource for future comparative studies. we also present a revised classification of squamates at the family and subfamily level to bring the taxonomy more in line with the new phylogenetic hypothesis. this classification includes new, resurrected, and modified subfamilies within gymnophthalmid and scincid lizards, and boid, colubrid, and lamprophiid snakes.
