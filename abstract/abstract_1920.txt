BACKGROUND
salicylic acid is a critical signalling component in plant defence responses. in arabidopsis, isochorismate synthase encoded by sid <dig> is essential for the biosynthesis of salicylic acid in response to biotic challenges. recently, both the calmodulin binding protein cbp60g and its closest homolog, the non-calmodulin binding sard <dig>  have been shown to bind to the promoter region of sid <dig>  loss of both cbp60g and sard <dig> severely impacts the plants ability to produce sa in response to bacterial inoculation and renders the plant susceptible to infection. in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay cbp60g and sard <dig> were shown to bind specifically to a 10mer oligonucleotide with the sequence gaaattttgg.


RESULTS
gene expression profiling on a custom microarray identified a set of genes, like sid <dig>  down-regulated in cbp60g sard <dig> mutant plants. co-expression analysis across a defined set of ath <dig> full genome microarray experiments expanded this gene set; clustering analysis was then applied to group densely interconnected genes. a stringent threshold for co-expression identified two related calmodulin-like genes tightly associated with sid <dig>  sid <dig> was found to cluster with genes whose promoter regions were significantly enriched with gaaatt motifs. genes clustering with sid <dig> were found to be down-regulated in the cbp60g sard <dig> double mutant. representative genes from other clusters enriched with the gaaatt motif were found to be variously down-regulated, unchanged or up-regulated in the double mutant. a previously characterised co-expression between sid <dig> and wrky <dig> was not reproduced in this analysis but was contained within a subset of the experiments where sid <dig> was co-expressed with cbp60g or sard <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
putative components of the cbp60g sard <dig> signalling network have been uncovered by co-expression analysis. in addition to genes whose regulation is similar to that of sid <dig> some are repressed by cbp60g and sard <dig>
