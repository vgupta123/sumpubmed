BACKGROUND
the structure of contact between individuals plays an important role in the incursion and spread of contagious diseases in both human and animal populations. in the case of avian influenza, the movement of live birds is a well known risk factor for the geographic dissemination of the virus among poultry flocks. live bird markets  contribute to the epidemiology of avian influenza due to their demographic characteristics and the presence of hpai h5n <dig> virus lineages. the relationship between poultry producers and live poultry traders  that operate in lbm's has not been adequately documented in hpai h5n1-affected se asian countries. the aims of this study were to document and study the flow of live poultry in a poultry trade network in northern vietnam, and explore its potential role in the risk for hpai h5n <dig> during  <dig> to  <dig> 


RESULTS
our results indicate that lpt's trading for less than a year and operating at retail markets are more likely to source poultry from flocks located in communes with a past history of hpai h5n <dig> outbreaks during  <dig> to  <dig> than lpt's trading longer than a year and operating at wholesale markets. the results of the network analysis indicate that lpt's tend to link communes of similar infection status.


CONCLUSIONS
our study provides evidence which can be used for informing policies aimed at encouraging more biosecure practices of lpt's operating at authorised lbm's. the results suggest that lpt's play a role in hpai h5n <dig> transmission and may contribute to perpetuating hpai h5n <dig> virus circulation amongst certain groups of communes. the impact of current disease prevention and control interventions could be enhanced by disseminating information about outbreak risk and the implementation of a formal data recording scheme at lbm's for all incoming and outgoing lpt's.
