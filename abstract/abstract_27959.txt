BACKGROUND
nontyphoidal salmonella is the main cause of human salmonellosis. in order to study the prevalent serogroups and serovars of clinical isolates in taiwan,  <dig> salmonellae isolates were collected from  <dig> medical centers and district hospitals throughout the country from  <dig> to  <dig>  the pulsed-field eletrophoresis types  and antibiotic resistance profiles of salmonella enterica serovars bareilly  and braenderup  were compared, and multi-drug resistance  plasmids were characterized.


RESULTS
over 95% of human salmonellosis in taiwan was caused by five salmonella serogroups: b, c <dig>  c2-c <dig>  d <dig>  and e <dig>  s. typhymurium, s. enteritidis, s. stanley and s. newport were the four most prevalent serovars, accounting for about 64% of isolates. while only one or two major serovars from four of the most prevalent serogroups were represented, four predominant serovars were found in serogroup c <dig> salmonellae. the prevalence was decreasing for s. choleraeuis and s. braenderup, and s. virchow and increasing for s. bareilly. s. braenderup mainly caused gastroenteritis in children; in contrast, s. bareiley infected children and elderly people. both serovars differed by xbai-pfge patterns. almost all s. bareilly isolates were susceptible to antibiotics of interest, while all lacked plasmids and belonged to one clone. two distinct major clones in s. braenderup were cluster a, mainly including mdr isolates with large mdr plasmid from north taiwan, and cluster b, mainly containing susceptible isolates without r plasmid from south taiwan. in cluster a, there were two types of conjugative r plasmids with sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kb. type  <dig> plasmids consisted of replicons f1a/f1b, blatem, is <dig>  and a class  <dig> integron with the genes dfra12-orff-aada2-qaceÎ”1-suli. type  <dig> plasmids belonged to incompatibility group inci, contained tnpa-blacmy-2-blc-suge genetic structures and lacked both is <dig> and class  <dig> integrons. although type  <dig> plasmids showed higher conjugation capability, type  <dig> plasmids were the predominant plasmid.


CONCLUSIONS
serogroups b, c <dig>  c2-c <dig>  d <dig>  and e <dig> of salmonella caused over 95% of human salmonellosis. two prevalent serovars within serogroup c <dig>  s. bareilly and cluster b of s. braenderup, were clonal and drug-susceptible. however, cluster a of s. braenderup was mdr and probably derived from susceptible isolates by acquiring one of two distinct conjugative r plasmids.
