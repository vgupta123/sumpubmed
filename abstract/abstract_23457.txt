BACKGROUND
interferon-α  exerts an anti-tumor effect at least through induction of apoptosis in a variety of types including b lymphoma cells. we recently found that ifn-α induced a sustained activation of c-jun nh2-terminal kinase <dig> , which is implicated in activation of the tumor necrosis factor -related apoptosis-inducing ligand  promoter. in the present study, we explored upstream component of the prolonged ifn-α-initiated activation of jnk <dig> 


RESULTS
ifn-α caused activation of pkc-δ in daudi b lymphoma cells and myeloma u <dig> cells, as detected by western blotting using a monoclonal antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of pkc-δ. the dominant-negative form of mutant pkc-δ  reduced the ifn-α-induced jnk <dig> activation, trail promoter activity, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential , and increase in propidium iodide  positive cells. the ifn-α-induced activation of jnk <dig> and the trail promoter was also attenuated by the pkc-δ inhibitor rottlerin. moreover, a constitutively active form of mutant pkc-δ enhanced the ifn-α-induced trail promoter activity and loss of ΔΨm in daudi b lymphoma cells. in addition, ifn-α-induced ser <dig> phosphorylation of stat <dig> was also abrogated by dnpkc-δ.


CONCLUSIONS
ifn-α induced jnk <dig> activation via pkc-δ, leading to upregulation of trail. the interaction of the consequent enhanced trail expression with trail-receptor results in a loss of ΔΨm and increase in pi positive cells. the ifn-α-induced apoptotic events may also be affected by the ser727-stat <dig> induced by pkc-δ-mediated signaling component.
