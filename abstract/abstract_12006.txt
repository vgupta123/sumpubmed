BACKGROUND
susceptibility of sheep to scrapie infection is known to be modulated by the prp genotype of the animal. in the netherlands an ambitious scrapie control programme was started in  <dig>  based on genetic selection of animals for breeding. from  <dig> onwards eu regulations required intensive active scrapie surveillance as well as certain control measures in affected flocks.

here we analyze the data on genotype frequencies and scrapie prevalence in the dutch sheep population obtained from both surveillance and affected flocks, to identify temporal trends. we also estimate the genotype-specific relative risks to become a detected scrapie case.


RESULTS
we find that the breeding programme has produced a steady increase in the level of genetic scrapie resistance in the dutch sheep population. we also find that a significant decline in the prevalence of scrapie in tested animals has occurred a number of years after the start of the breeding programme. most importantly, the estimated scrapie prevalence level per head of susceptible genotype is also declining significantly, indicating that selective breeding causes a population effect.


CONCLUSIONS
the dutch scrapie control programme has produced a steady rise in genetic resistance levels in recent years. a recent decline in the scrapie prevalence per tested sheep of susceptible prion protein genotype indicates that selective breeding causes the desired population effect.
