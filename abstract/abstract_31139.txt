BACKGROUND
trem- <dig> , a receptor expressed on neutrophils and monocytes, is upregulated in sepsis and seems to tune the inflammatory response. we explored the expression of trem- <dig> at the gene level and on cell membranes of monocytes and association with clinical outcome.

methods
peripheral venous blood was sampled from  <dig> septic patients  on sepsis days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  trem- <dig> on monocytes was measured by flow cytometry; gene expression of trem- <dig> in circulating mononuclear cells was assessed by real-time pcr. strem- <dig> was measured in serum by an enzyme immunoassay.


RESULTS
although surface trem- <dig>  strem- <dig> and trem- <dig> gene expression did not differ between sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock on day  <dig>  survivors had greater expression of surface trem- <dig> on days  <dig> and  <dig> compared to non-survivors. strem- <dig> on non-survivors decreased on day  <dig> compared to baseline. patients with increase of monocyte gene expression of trem- <dig> from day  <dig> to day  <dig> had prolonged survival compared to patients with decrease of gene expression of trem- <dig> from day  <dig> to day  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
early decrease of gene expression of trem- <dig> in monocytes is associated with poor outcome. a reciprocal decrease of the pro-inflammatory surface receptor trem- <dig> linked with sepsis-induced immunosuppression may be part of the explanation.
