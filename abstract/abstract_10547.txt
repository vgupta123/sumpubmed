BACKGROUND
massively parallel sequencing readouts of epigenomic assays are enabling integrative genome-wide analyses of genomic and epigenomic variation. pash  <dig>  performs sequence comparison and read mapping and can be employed as a module within diverse configurable analysis pipelines, including chip-seq and methylome mapping by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing.


RESULTS
pash  <dig>  generally matches the accuracy and speed of niche programs for fast mapping of short reads, and exceeds their performance on longer reads generated by a new generation of massively parallel sequencing technologies. by exploiting longer read lengths, pash  <dig>  maps reads onto the large fraction of genomic dna that contains repetitive elements and polymorphic sites, including indel polymorphisms.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate the versatility of pash  <dig>  by analyzing the interaction between cpg methylation, cpg snps, and imprinting based on publicly available whole-genome shotgun bisulfite sequencing data. pash  <dig>  makes use of gapped k-mer alignment, a non-seed based comparison method, which is implemented using multi-positional hash tables. this allows pash  <dig>  to run on diverse hardware platforms, including individual computers with standard ram capacity, multi-core hardware architectures and large clusters.
