BACKGROUND
plant mitochondria, semiautonomous organelles that function as manufacturers of cellular atp, have their own genome that has a slow rate of evolution and rapid rearrangement. cytoplasmic male sterility , a common phenotype in higher plants, is closely associated with rearrangements in mitochondrial dna , and is widely used to produce f <dig> hybrid seeds in a variety of valuable crop species. novel chimeric genes deduced from mtdna rearrangements causing cms have been identified in several plants, such as rice, sunflower, pepper, and rapeseed, but there are very few reports about mtdna rearrangements in wheat. in the present work, we describe the mitochondrial genome of a wheat k-type cms line and compare it with its maintainer line.


RESULTS
the complete mtdna sequence of a wheat k-type  cms line, ks <dig>  was assembled into a master circle  molecule of  <dig>  bp and found to harbor  <dig> known protein-coding genes, three rrnas , and  <dig> different trnas. compared to our previously published sequence of a k-type maintainer line, km <dig>  we detected ks3-specific mtdna  and repeats  as well as genes that are unique to each line: rpl <dig> was missing in ks <dig> and trnh was absent from km <dig>  we also defined  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  in  <dig> protein-coding, albeit functionally irrelevant, genes, and predicted  <dig> unique orfs in ks <dig>  representing potential candidates for k-type cms. all these sequence variations are candidates for involvement in cms. a comparative analysis of the mtdna of several angiosperms, including those from ks <dig>  km <dig>  rice, maize, arabidopsis thaliana, and rapeseed, showed that non-coding sequences of higher plants had mostly divergent multiple reorganizations during the mtdna evolution of higher plants.


CONCLUSIONS
the complete mitochondrial genome of the wheat k-type cms line ks <dig> is very different from that of its maintainer line km <dig>  especially in non-coding sequences. sequence rearrangement has produced novel chimeric orfs, which may be candidate genes for cms. comparative analysis of several angiosperm mtdnas indicated that non-coding sequences are the most frequently reorganized during mtdna evolution in higher plants.
