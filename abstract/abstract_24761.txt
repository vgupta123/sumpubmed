BACKGROUND

haemophilus parasuis is the etiological agent of glässer’s disease in swine. h. parasuis comprises strains with heterogeneous virulence capacity, from non-virulent to highly virulent. determination of the pathogenic potential of the strains is important for diagnosis and disease control. the virulence-associated trimeric autotransporters  genes have been used to predict h. parasuis virulence by pcr amplification of their translocator domains. here, we report a new and improved pcr designed to detect a different domain of the vtaa genes, the leader sequence  as a diagnostic tool to predict virulence.

methods
a collection of  <dig> ﻿h. parasuis ﻿strains was tested by pcr with ls specific primers. results of the pcr were compared with the clinical origin of the strains and, for a subset of strains, with their phagocytosis and serum resistance using a chi-square test.


RESULTS
ls-pcr was specific to h. parasuis, and allowed the differential detection of the leader sequences found in clinical and non-clinical isolates. significant correlation was observed between the results of the ls-pcr and the clinical origin  of the strains, as well as with their phagocytosis and serum susceptibility, indicating that this pcr is a good predictor of the virulence of the strains. in addition, this new pcr showed a full correlation with the previously validated pcr based on the translocator domain. ls-pcr could be performed in a wide range of annealing temperatures without losing specificity.


CONCLUSIONS
this newly described pcr based on the leader sequence of the vtaa genes, ls-pcr, is a robust test for the prediction of the virulence potential of h. parasuis strains.
