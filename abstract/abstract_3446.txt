BACKGROUND
the noble scallop chlamys nobilis reeve displays polymorphism in shell and muscle colors. previous research showed that the orange scallops with orange shell and muscle had a significantly higher carotenoid content than the brown ones with brown shell and white muscle. there is currently a need to identify candidate genes associated with carotenoid-based coloration.


RESULTS
in the present study,  <dig> gs-flx sequencing of noble scallop transcriptome yielded  <dig> , <dig> clean sequence reads, which were assembled into  <dig>  isotigs, leaving  <dig>  reads as the singletons. of the  <dig>  unique sequences,  <dig> % isotigs and  <dig> % singletons were annotated. moreover,  <dig>  ssrs and over  <dig>  high confidence variants  were identified. especially, one class b scavenge receptor termed srb-like- <dig> was discovered to express only in orange scallops and absent in brown ones, suggesting a significant association with high carotenoid content. down-regulation of srb-like- <dig> mrna by rna interference remarkably decreased blood carotenoid, providing compelling evidence that srb-like- <dig> is an ideal candidate gene controlling carotenoid deposition and determining orange coloration.


CONCLUSIONS
transcriptome analysis of noble scallop reveals a novel scavenger receptor significantly associated with orange scallop rich in carotenoid content. our findings pave the way for further functional elucidation of this gene and molecular basis of carotenoid deposition in orange scallop.
