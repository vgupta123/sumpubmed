BACKGROUND
marfan syndrome  is a heritable connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the fibrillin- <dig> gene. this syndrome constitutes a significant identifiable subtype of aortic aneurysmal disease, accounting for over 5% of ascending and thoracic aortic aneurysms.


RESULTS
we used spotted membrane dna macroarrays to identify genes whose altered expression levels may contribute to the phenotype of the disease. our analysis of  <dig> genes identified a subset with significant expression differences between skin fibroblast cultures from unaffected controls versus cultures from affected individuals with known fibrillin- <dig> mutations. subsequently,  <dig> genes were chosen for validation by quantitative rt-pcr.


CONCLUSIONS
differential expression of many of the validated genes was associated with mfs samples when an additional group of unaffected and mfs affected subjects were analyzed . an unexpected observation was the range of individual gene expression. in unaffected control subjects, expression ranges exceeding  <dig> fold were seen in many of the genes selected for qrt-pcr validation. the variation in expression in the mfs affected subjects was even greater.
