BACKGROUND
classical bioconjugation strategies for generating antibody-functionalized nanoparticles are non-specific and typically result in heterogeneous compounds that can be compromised in activity. expression systems based on self-cleavable intein domains allow the generation of recombinant proteins with a c-terminal thioester, providing a unique handle for site-specific conjugation using native chemical ligation . however, current methods to generate antibody fragments with c-terminal thioesters require cumbersome refolding procedures, effectively preventing application of ncl for antibody-mediated targeting and molecular imaging.


RESULTS
targeting to the periplasm of e. coli allowed efficient production of correctly-folded single-domain antibody -intein fusions proteins. on column purification and 2-mercapthoethanesulfonic acid -induced cleavage yielded single-domain antibodies with a reactive c-terminal mesna thioester in good yields. these thioester-functionalized single-domain antibodies allowed synthesis of immunomicelles via native chemical ligation in a single step.


CONCLUSIONS
a novel procedure was developed to obtain soluble, well-folded single-domain antibodies with reactive c-terminal thioesters in good yields. these proteins are promising building blocks for the chemoselective functionalization via ncl of a broad range of nanoparticle scaffolds, including micelles, liposomes and dendrimers.
