BACKGROUND
tooth root problems and periodontal diseases are common in south american camelids . the objective was to evaluate and optimize the imaging technique for dental radiography in sac and to describe the radiographic and computed tomographic  anatomy of normal teeth at different ages. in this study, the heads of  <dig> healthy sac slaughtered for meat production or euthanized for reasons not related to dental problems included  <dig> female and  <dig> male llamas and  <dig> male alpacas. using a standardized protocol, radiographs and ct scans of the  <dig> specimen were performed.


RESULTS
the most useful radiographic projections for mandibular and maxillary cheek teeth evaluation turned out to be lateral30°ventral - laterodorsal and lateral30°dorsal - lateroventral with slight separation of the dental arcades respectively. digital radiographic and ct appearance of the mandibular and maxillary teeth were described from the beginning of mineralization till maturity. in addition the normal range of the ct radio density of different cheek teeth and different dental tissues were measured. hounsfield units of different dental tissues of sac turned out to be similar to equids.

deviation, shortening and partial destruction of the distal tooth root of mandibular 09′s and 10′s and of maxillary 09′s was observed and the existence of a common pulp chamber in younger teeth was revealed.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides information about the dental imaging morphology in clinically healthy sac. this basic information provides fundamental knowledge for evaluating images and planning treatments in clinically affected animals.
