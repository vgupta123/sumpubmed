BACKGROUND
in recent years, rna molecules that are not translated into proteins  have drawn a great deal of attention, as they were shown to be involved in many cellular functions. one of the most important computational problems regarding ncrna is to predict the secondary structure of a molecule from its sequence. in particular, we attempted to predict the secondary structure for a set of unaligned ncrna molecules that are taken from the same family, and thus presumably have a similar structure.


RESULTS
we developed the rnaspa program, which comparatively predicts the secondary structure for a set of ncrna molecules in linear time in the number of molecules. we observed that in a list of several hundred suboptimal minimal free energy  predictions, as provided by the rnasubopt program of the vienna package, it is likely that at least one suggested structure would be similar to the true, correct one. the suboptimal solutions of each molecule are represented as a layer of vertices in a graph. the shortest path in this graph is the basis for structural predictions for the molecule. we also show that rna secondary structures can be compared very rapidly by a simple string edit-distance algorithm with a minimal loss of accuracy. we show that this approach allows us to more deeply explore the suboptimal structure space.


CONCLUSIONS
the algorithm was tested on three datasets which include several ncrna families taken from the rfam database. these datasets allowed for comparison of the algorithm with other methods. in these tests, rnaspa performed better than four other programs.
