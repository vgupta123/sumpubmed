BACKGROUND
the second messenger cyclic diguanylate  plays a central role in bacterial adaptation to extracellular stimuli, controlling processes such as motility, biofilm development, cell development and, in some pathogens, virulence. the intracellular level of c-di-gmp is controlled by the complementary activities of diguanylate cyclases containing a ggdef domain and two classes of c-di-gmp phosphodiesterases containing an eal or hd-gyp hydrolytic domain. compared to the ggdef and eal domains, the functions of hd-gyp domain family proteins are poorly characterized. the human diarrheal pathogen vibrio cholerae encodes nine putative hd-gyp domain proteins. to determine the contributions of hd-gyp domain proteins to c-di-gmp signaling in v. cholerae, we systematically analyzed the enzymatic functionality of each protein and their involvement in processes known to be regulated by c-di-gmp: motility, biofilm development and virulence.


RESULTS
complementary in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that four hd-gyp domain proteins are active c-di-gmp phosphodiesterases: vc <dig>  vc <dig>  vca <dig> and vca <dig>  mutation of individual hd-gyp domain genes, as well as combinatorial mutations of multiple hd-gyp domain genes, had no effect on motility or biofilm formation of v. cholerae under the conditions tested. furthermore, no single hd-gyp domain gene affected intestinal colonization by v. cholerae in an infant mouse model. however, inactivation of multiple hd-gyp domain genes, including the four encoding functional phosphodiesterases, significantly attenuated colonization.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that the hd-gyp family of c-di-gmp phosphodiesterases impacts signaling by this second messenger during infection. altogether, this work greatly furthers the understanding of this important family of c-di-gmp metabolic enzymes and demonstrates a role for hd-gyp domain proteins in the virulence of v. cholerae.
