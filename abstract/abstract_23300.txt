BACKGROUND
toll-like receptor  <dig>  is important to host recognition of invading gram-positive microbes. in goats, these microbes can cause serious mastitis, anthrax, tetanus, and other problems. transgenic goats constitutively over-expressing tlr <dig> in many tissues serve as a suitable model for the study of the role of tlr <dig> over-expression in bacterial clearance.


RESULTS
capra hircus tlr <dig> over-expression vector  was used to generate transgenic goats by egg microinjection. the integration efficiency was  <dig> %. real-time pcr and immunohistochemical results confirmed that the goats over-expressing the tlr <dig> gene  expressed more tlr <dig> than wild-type goats . monocyte-macrophages from the bloodstreams of transgenic goats were stimulated with synthetic bacterial lipoprotein  and by the promotion of interleukin- <dig>  and il- <dig> expression in vitro. the oxidative damage was significantly reduced, and lysozyme  secretion was found to be up-regulated. ear tissue samples from transgenic goats that had been stimulated with pam3csk <dig> via hypodermic injection showed that transgenic individuals can undergo the inflammation response very quickly.


CONCLUSIONS
over-expression of tlr <dig> was found to decrease radical damage to host cells through low-level production of no and mda and to promote the clearance of invasive bacteria by up-regulating lysozyme secretion and filtration of inflammatory cells to the infected site.
