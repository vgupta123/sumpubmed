BACKGROUND
butterfly wing color patterns are a key model for integrating evolutionary developmental biology and the study of adaptive morphological evolution. yet, despite the biological, economical and educational value of butterflies they are still relatively under-represented in terms of available genomic resources. here, we describe an expression sequence tag  project for bicyclus anynana that has identified the largest available collection to date of expressed genes for any butterfly.


RESULTS
by targeting cdnas from developing wings at the stages when pattern is specified, we biased gene discovery towards genes potentially involved in pattern formation. assembly of  <dig>  ests from a subtracted library allowed us to identify  <dig>  genes of which  <dig>  were annotated based on blast analyses against relevant gene collections. gene prediction software identified  <dig>  peptides, of which  <dig> longer than  <dig> amino acids had no homology to any known proteins and, thus, potentially represent novel or highly diverged butterfly genes. we combined gene and single nucleotide polymorphism  identification by constructing cdna libraries from pools of outbred individuals, and by sequencing clones from the 3' end to maximize alignment depth. alignments of multi-member contigs allowed us to identify over  <dig>  putative snps, with  <dig> genes having at least one high confidence double-hit snp. we furthermore identified  <dig> microsatellites in transcribed genes that can potentially be used as genetic markers.


CONCLUSIONS
our project was designed to combine gene and sequence polymorphism discovery and has generated the largest gene collection available for any butterfly and many potential markers in expressed genes. these resources will be invaluable for exploring the potential of b. anynana in particular, and butterflies in general, as models in ecological, evolutionary, and developmental genetics.
