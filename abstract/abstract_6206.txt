BACKGROUND
canine b-cell lymphoma is deemed an ideal model of human non-hodgkin’s lymphoma where the lymphomas of both species share similar clinical features and biological behaviors. however there are some differences between tumor features in both species. in the current study, we sought to evaluate the prognostic efficacy of human b-cell lymphoma prognostic gene signatures in canine b-cell lymphoma.

methods
the corresponding probe sets of  <dig> human b-cell lymphoma prognostic genes were retrieved from  <dig> canine b-cell lymphoma microarray datasets  , and prognostic probe sets were thereafter detected using the univariate and multivariate cox proportional-hazard model and the kaplan–meier analysis. the two datasets were employed both as training sets and as external validation sets for each other. results were confirmed using quantitative real-time pcr  analysis.


RESULTS
in the univariate analysis, ccnd <dig>  ccnd <dig>  pax <dig>  cr <dig>  lmo <dig>  hla-dqa <dig>  p <dig>  cd <dig>  myc-n, mybl <dig>  and bircs <dig> were associated with longer disease-free survival , while cd <dig>  plau, and fn <dig> were allied to shorter dfs. however, the multivariate cox proportional-hazard analysis confirmed ccnd <dig> and bircs <dig> as prognostic genes for canine b-cell lymphoma. qrt-pcr used for verification of results indicated that expression level of ccnd <dig> was significantly higher in b-cell lymphoma patients with the long dfs than ones with the short dfs, while expression level of bircs <dig> wasn’t significantly different between two groups.


CONCLUSIONS
our results confirmed ccnd <dig> as important gene that can be used as a potential predictor in this tumor type.
