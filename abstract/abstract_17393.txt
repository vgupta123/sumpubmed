BACKGROUND
to obtain important expressed sequence tags  located on specific chromosomes is currently difficult. construction of single-chromosome est library could be an efficient strategy to isolate important ests located on specific chromosomes. in this research we developed a method to rapidly isolate ests from chromosome 1r of rye by combining the techniques of chromosome microdissection with hybrid specific amplification .


RESULTS
chromosome 1r was isolated by a glass needle and digested with proteinase k . the dna of chromosome 1r was amplified by two rounds of pcr using a degenerated oligonucleotide 6-mw sequence with a sau3ai digestion site as the primer. the pcr product was digested with sau3ai and linked with adaptor hsa <dig>  then hybridized with the sau3ai digested cdna with adaptor hsa <dig> of rye leaves with and without salicylic acid  treatment, respectively. the hybridized dna fragments were recovered by the hsa method and cloned into pmd18-t vector. the cloned inserts were released by pcr using the partial sequences in hsa <dig> and hsa <dig> as the primers and then sequenced. of the  <dig> ests obtained and analyzed,  <dig> were known sequences located on rye chromosome 1r or on homologous group  <dig> chromosomes of wheat; all of them were highly homologous with ests of wheat, barley and/or other plants in gramineae, some of which were induced by abiotic or biotic stresses. isolated in this research were  <dig> ests with unknown functions, probably representing some new genes on rye chromosome 1r.


CONCLUSIONS
we developed a new method to rapidly clone chromosome-specific ests from chromosome 1r of rye. the information reported here should be useful for cloning and investigating the new genes found on chromosome 1r.
