BACKGROUND
understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in disease is critical for the development of more effective and individualized strategies for prevention and treatment. the amount of disease-related literature, including new genetic information on the molecular mechanisms of disease, is rapidly increasing. extracting beneficial information from literature can be facilitated by computational methods such as the knowledge-discovery approach. several methods for mining gene-disease relationships using computational methods have been developed, however, there has been a lack of research evaluating specific disease candidate genes.


RESULTS
we present a novel method for gathering and prioritizing specific disease candidate genes. our approach involved the construction of a set of medical subject headings  terms for the effective retrieval of publications related to a disease candidate gene. information regarding the relationships between genes and publications was obtained from the gene2pubmed database. the set of genes was prioritized using a “weighted literature score” based on the number of publications and weighted by the number of genes occurring in a publication. using our method for the disease states of pain and alzheimer’s disease, a total of  <dig> pain candidate genes and  <dig> alzheimer’s disease candidate genes were gathered and prioritized. the precision was  <dig>  and the recall was  <dig>  in the case study of pain. the precision was  <dig>  and the recall was  <dig>  in the case study of alzheimer’s disease. the precision-recall curve indicated that the performance of our method was superior to that of other publicly available tools.


CONCLUSIONS
our method, which involved the use of a set of mesh terms related to disease candidate genes and a novel weighted literature score, improved the accuracy of gathering and prioritizing candidate genes by focusing on a specific disease.
