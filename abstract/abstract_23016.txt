BACKGROUND
parental allocation and reproductive success are often strongly influenced by environmental factors. in this respect, salinity is a key factor influencing species distributions and community structure in aquatic animals. nevertheless, the effects of salinity on reproductive behaviours are not well known. here, we used the sand goby , a small fish inhabiting a range of different salinities, to experimentally assess the effects of changes in salinity on nesting behaviour, a key component of reproduction in sand gobies and many other taxa.


RESULTS
we found that salinity levels influenced some aspects of male nesting behaviour  but not others  and that small and large individuals were differently affected. in particular, the importance of body size in adjustment of nest entrance depended on the salinity level.


CONCLUSIONS
the results support the prediction that geographically widespread aquatic species, such as sand gobies, are able to perform well under a range of salinity levels. the phenotype by environment interaction found between male size and behavioural responses to salinity can, in turn, help to explain the notable variation observed in nest-building  behaviours closely linked to reproduction.
