BACKGROUND
porcine circovirus type  <dig>  is an etiological agent of porcine circovirus diseases . post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome  as the most important pcvd is considered a multifactorial disease. it was demonstrated that not only pcv <dig> but several viruses are associated with pmws. studies of viral co-infections in pmws pigs led often to controversial results. the aim of this work was to determine the presence of emerging , re-emerging  and newly-emerging  viruses in samples of dead pigs suffering from pmws. the impact of vaccination against pcv <dig> and the influence of age on the occurrence of single and multiple viral infections in pigs were also investigated.


RESULTS
viruses were detected by pcr, rt-pcr and real-time pcr in the pooled tissue samples  of pigs with pmws  which were divided into three groups: suckling piglets, post-weaning pigs and fattening pigs. in addition, lymph node samples were collected from apparently healthy fattening pigs . the effect of vaccination against pcv <dig> with ingelvac circoflex vaccine was also investigated. between non-vaccinated pigs, the highest prevalence of individual viruses and multiple viral infections were found in diseased post-weaning and fattening animals with pmws. severe clinical disease was observed in swine co-infected with pcv <dig> and prrsv. the prevalence of ttsuv <dig> and ttsuv <dig> was high in all groups of pigs and did not appear to have a significant effect on the syndrome. simultaneous infection with ttsuv <dig> and pbov <dig> was frequently confirmed in pigs with pmws. no healthy pig was found to be infected with prrsv, ptv or pbov <dig>  vaccination against pcv <dig> did not influence the prevalence of ttsuvs, but significantly protected pigs against multiple viral infections.


CONCLUSIONS
post-weaning pmws pigs were more often co-infected with viral pathogens than suckling or fattening pigs. co-infection with prrsv enforces clinical signs of pmws, the influence of other viral co-infections is not clear. vaccination against pcv <dig> significantly reduced viral co-infections in pigs.
