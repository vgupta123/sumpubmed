BACKGROUND
polyoxypeptin a was isolated from a culture broth of streptomyces sp. mk498-98 f <dig>  which has a potent apoptosis-inducing activity towards human pancreatic carcinoma aspc- <dig> cells. structurally, polyoxypeptin a is composed of a c <dig> acyl side chain and a nineteen-membered cyclodepsipeptide core that consists of six unusual nonproteinogenic amino acid residues  at high oxidation states.


RESULTS
a gene cluster containing  <dig> open reading frames  has been sequenced and analyzed for the biosynthesis of polyoxypeptin a. we constructed  <dig> specific gene inactivation mutants, most of which abolished the production of polyoxypeptin a and only Δplym mutant accumulated a dehydroxylated analogue polyoxypeptin b. based on bioinformatics analysis and genetic data, we proposed the biosynthetic pathway of polyoxypeptin a and biosynthetic models of six unusual amino acid building blocks and a pks extender unit.


CONCLUSIONS
the identified gene cluster and proposed pathway for the biosynthesis of polyoxypeptin a will pave a way to understand the biosynthetic mechanism of the azinothricin family natural products and provide opportunities to apply combinatorial biosynthesis strategy to create more useful compounds.
