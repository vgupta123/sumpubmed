BACKGROUND
histone modification is an epigenetic mechanism that influences gene regulation in eukaryotes. in particular, histone modifications in cpg islands  are associated with different chromatin states and with transcription activity. changes in gene expression play a crucial role in adaptation and evolution.


RESULTS
in this paper, we have studied, using a computational biology approach, the relationship between histone modifications in cgis and selective pressure in homo sapiens. we considered three histone modifications: histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> trimethylation , histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> acetylation  and histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> trimethylation , and we used the publicly available genomic-scale histone modification data of thirteen human cell lines. to define regions under selective pressure, we used three distinct signatures that mark selective events from different evolutionary periods. we found that cgis under selective pressure showed significant enrichments for histone modifications.


CONCLUSIONS
our result suggests that, cgis that have undergone selective events are characterized by epigenetic signatures, in particular, histone modifications that are distinct from cgis with no evidence of selection.
