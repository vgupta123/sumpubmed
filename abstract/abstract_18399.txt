BACKGROUND
transcriptional regulation of genes in eukaryotes is achieved by the interactions of multiple transcription factors with arrays of transcription factor binding sites  on dna and with each other. identification of these tfbss is an essential step in our understanding of gene regulatory networks, but computational prediction of tfbss with either consensus or commonly used stochastic models such as position-specific scoring matrices  results in an unacceptably high number of hits consisting of a few true functional binding sites and numerous false non-functional binding sites. this is due to the inability of the models to incorporate higher order properties of sequences including sequences surrounding tfbss and influencing the positioning of nucleosomes and/or the interactions that might occur between transcription factors.


RESULTS
significant improvement can be expected through the development of a new framework for the modeling and prediction of tfbss that considers explicitly these higher order sequence properties. it would be particularly interesting to include in the new modeling framework the information present in the nucleosome positioning sequences  surrounding tfbss, as it can be hypothesized that genomes use this information to encode the formation of stable nucleosomes over non-functional sites, while functional sites have a more open chromatin configuration.

in this report we evaluate the usefulness of the latter feature by comparing the nucleosome occupancy probabilities around experimentally verified human tfbss with the nucleosome occupancy probabilities around false positive tfbss and in random sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
we present evidence that nucleosome occupancy is remarkably lower around true functional human tfbss as compared to non-functional human tfbss, which supports the use of this feature to improve current tfbs prediction approaches in higher eukaryotes.
