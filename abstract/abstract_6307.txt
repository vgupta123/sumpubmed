BACKGROUND
enkephalins are endogenous opiates that are assumed to modulate nociceptive information by mediating synaptic transmission in the central nervous system, including the spinal dorsal horn.


RESULTS
to develop a new tool for the identification of in vitro enkephalinergic neurons and to analyze enkephalin promoter activity, we generated transgenic mice for a bacterial artificial chromosome . enkephalinergic neurons from these mice expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein  under the control of the preproenkephalin  gene  promoter. egfp-positive neurons were distributed throughout the gray matter of the spinal cord, and were primarily observed in laminae i-ii and v-vii, in a pattern similar to the distribution pattern of enkephalin-containing neurons. double immunostaining analysis using anti-enkephalin and anti-egfp antibodies showed that all egfp-expressing neurons contained enkephalin. incubation in the presence of forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, increased the number of egfp-positive neurons. these results indicate that egfp expression is controlled by the penk <dig> promoter, which contains cyclic amp-responsive elements. sections obtained from sciatic nerve-ligated mice exhibited increased egfp-positive neurons on the ipsilateral  compared with the contralateral . these data indicate that ppe expression is affected by peripheral nerve injury. additionally, single-neuron rt-pcr analysis showed that several egfp positive-neurons in laminae i-ii expressed glutamate decarboxylase  <dig> mrna and that some expressed serotonin type  <dig> receptors.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that egfp-positive neurons in laminae i-ii coexpress enkephalin and Î³-aminobutyric acid , and are activated by forskolin and in conditions of nerve injury. the penk1-egfp bac transgenic mouse contributes to the further characterization of enkephalinergic neurons in the transmission and modulation of nociceptive information.
