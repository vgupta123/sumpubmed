BACKGROUND
marine turtles deposit their eggs on tropical or subtropical beaches during discrete nesting seasons that span several months. the number and distribution of nests laid during a nesting season provide vital information on various aspects of marine turtle ecology and conservation.


RESULTS
in the case of leatherback sea turtles nesting in french guiana, we developed a mathematical model to explore the phenology of their nesting season, derived from an incomplete nest count dataset. we detected  <dig> primary components in the nest distribution of leatherbacks: an overall shape that corresponds to the arrival and departure of leatherback females in the guianas region, a sinusoidal pattern with a period of approximately  <dig> days that is related to physiological constraints of nesting female leatherbacks, and a sinusoidal pattern with a period of approximately  <dig> days that likely reflects the influence of spring high tides on nesting female turtles.


CONCLUSIONS
the model proposed here offers a variety of uses for both marine turtles and also other taxa when individuals are observed in a particular location for only part of the year.
