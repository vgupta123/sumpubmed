BACKGROUND
genetic mapping and quantitative trait locus  detection are powerful methodologies in plant improvement and breeding. white jute  is an important industrial raw material fiber crop because of its elite characteristics. however, construction of a high-density genetic map and identification of qtls has been limited in white jute due to a lack of sufficient molecular markers. the specific locus amplified fragment sequencing  strategy combines locus-specific amplification and high-throughput sequencing to carry out de novo single nuclear polymorphism  discovery and large-scale genotyping. in this study, slaf-seq was employed to obtain sufficient markers to construct a high-density genetic map for white jute. moreover, with the development of abundant markers, genetic dissection of fiber yield traits such as plant height was also possible. here, we present qtls associated with plant height that were identified using our newly constructed genetic linkage groups.


RESULTS
an f <dig> population consisting of  <dig> lines was developed. in total,  <dig>  high-quality slafs were detected of which  <dig>  slafs were polymorphic;  <dig> polymorphic markers were used for the construction of a genetic map. the average coverage for each slaf marker was 43-fold in the parents, and  <dig> -fold in each f <dig> individual. a linkage map was constructed that contained  <dig> slafs on  <dig> linkage groups  covering  <dig>  cm with an average density of  <dig>  cm per locus. among the  <dig> lgs, lg <dig> was the largest with  <dig> markers, a length of  <dig>  cm, and an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. lg <dig> was the smallest with only  <dig> markers, a length of  <dig>  cm, and an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. ‘snp_only’ markers accounted for  <dig> % and were the predominant markers on the map. qtl mapping based on the f <dig> phenotypes detected  <dig> plant height qtls including one major effect qtl across two cultivation locations, with each qtl accounting for  <dig> – <dig> % of the phenotypic variance.


CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, the linkage map constructed here is the densest one available to date for white jute. this analysis also identified the first qtl in white jute. the results will provide an important platform for gene/qtl mapping, sequence assembly, genome comparisons, and marker-assisted selection breeding for white jute.
