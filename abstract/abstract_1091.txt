BACKGROUND
single incision laparoscopic surgery  is a newly growing technique to replace a more invasive conventional multiple portal laparoscopic surgery. the objective of this study was to compare single  with three portal  laparoscopic splenectomy in dogs. mongrel dogs , weighting 15 ± 3 kg, were selected for this study . the area from xiphoid to pubis was prepared under aseptic conditions in dorsal recumbency with the head down and tilted  <dig> degree in the right lateral position. pneumoperitoneum was established by co <dig> using an automatic high flow pressure until achieving 12 mm hg. instrumentation used consisted of curved flexible-tip 5 mm maryland forceps and ultracision harmonic scalpel for sealing and cutting of the vessels and splenic attachments.


RESULTS
all dogs recovered uneventfully. the splenectomy procedure using sils and conventional methods were significantly different in the respective operative time  and the length of the surgical scar . there were no post-operative wound complication including inflammation, infection, hernia formation and dehiscence up to one month after surgery. meanwhile, the conversion to open surgery or application of additional portals was not required in both approaches.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that sils is a safe and feasible operation and could be used as an alternative approach to three portal  for splenectomy in dog.
