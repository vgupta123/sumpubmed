BACKGROUND
the transcription factor pax <dig> functions in the specification and maintenance of the differentiated cell lineages in the endocrine pancreas. it has two dna binding domains, the paired domain and the homeodomain, in addition to a c-terminal transactivation domain. the phenotype of pax6-/- knockout mice suggests non-redundant functions of the transcription factor in the development of glucagon-expressing α-cells as this cell type is absent in the mutants. we ask the question of how the differentiation of pancreatic endocrine cells, in particular that of α-cells, is affected by selective inactivation of either one of the three major domains of pax <dig> 


RESULTS
the pax6aey <dig> mutant mouse line, in which the paired domain is inactivated, showed a phenotype similar to that of pax6-/- knockout mice with a near complete absence of glucagon-positive α-cells , reduced β-cell area  and disorganized islets. the proportion of ghrelin-positive ε-cells was expanded. in pax6sey-neu mutants, which lack the transactivation domain, α-and β-cells where reduced to  <dig> and 40% of wt, respectively. we also studied two mouse lines with mutations in the homeodomain, pax64neu and pax6132-14neu. neighboring amino acids are affected in the two lines and both point mutations abolish dna binding of the classical p <dig> homeodomain target sequence. the pancreatic phenotype of the two mutants however was divergent. while pax64neu homozygotes showed a reduction of α- and β-cells to  <dig> and 61%, respectively, pancreatic endocrine development was unaltered in the pax6132-14neu mutant strain.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that inactivation of the pax <dig> paired domain leads to a more severe phenotype with regards to the differentiation of pancreatic α-cells than the loss of the transactivation domain. the analysis of two different homeodomain mutants suggests that the binding of pax <dig> to p <dig> homeodomain consensus sequences is not required for α-cell development. it rather seems that the homeodomain has a modulating role in pax <dig> function, possibly by facilitating a ph0-like binding confirmation on paired domain target genes like proglucagon. this function is differentially affected by the two homeodomain mutations analyzed in this study.
