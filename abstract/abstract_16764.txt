BACKGROUND
haplo-identical hematopoietic stem cell  transplantation is very successful in eradicating haematological tumours, but the long post-transplant t-lymphopenic phase is responsible for high morbidity and mortality rates. clark et al. have described a skin-explant system capable of producing host-tolerant donor-hsc derived t-cells. because this t-cell production platform has the potential to replenish the t-cell levels following transplantation, we set out to validate the skin-explant system.


RESULTS
following the published procedures, while using the same commercial components, it was impossible to reproduce the skin-explant conditions required for hsc differentiation towards mature t-cells. the keratinocyte maturation procedure resulted in fragile cells with minimum expression of delta-like ligand . in most experiments the generated cells failed to adhere to carriers or were quickly outcompeted by fibroblasts. consequently it was not possible to reproduce cell-culture conditions required for hsc differentiation into functional t-cells. using cell-lines over-expressing dll, we showed that the antibodies used by clark et al. were unable to detect native dll, but instead stained 7aad+ cells. therefore, it is unlikely that the observed t-lineage commitment from hsc is mediated by dll expressed on keratinocytes. in addition, we did confirm expression of the notch-ligand jagged- <dig> by keratinocytes.


CONCLUSIONS
currently, and unfortunately, it remains difficult to explain the development or growth of t-cells described by clark et al., but for the fate of patients suffering from lymphopenia it is essential to both reproduce and understand how these co-cultures really "work". fortunately, alternative procedures to speed-up t-cell reconstitution are being established and validated and may become available for patients in the near future.
