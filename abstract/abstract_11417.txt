BACKGROUND
recent theoretical and empirical work points toward a significant role for sex-chromosome linked genes in the evolution of traits that induce reproductive isolation and for traits that evolve under influence of sexual selection. empirical studies including recently diverged , short-lived avian species pairs with short generation times have found that introgression occurs on the autosomes but not on the z-chromosome. here we study genetic differentiation and gene flow in the long-lived greater spotted eagle  and lesser spotted eagle , two species with comparatively long generation times.


RESULTS
our data suggest that there is a directional bias in migration rates between hybridizing spotted eagles in eastern europe. we find that a model including post divergence gene flow fits our data best for both autosomal and z-chromosome linked loci but, for the z-chromosome, the rate is reduced in the direction from a. pomarina to a. clanga.


CONCLUSIONS
the fact that some introgression still occurs on the z-chromosome between these species suggests that the differentiation process is in a more premature phase in our study system than in previously studied avian species pairs and that could be explained by a shorter divergence time and/or a longer average generation time in the spotted eagles. the results are in agreement with field observations and provide further insight into the role of sex-linked loci for the build-up of barriers to gene flow among diverging populations and species.
