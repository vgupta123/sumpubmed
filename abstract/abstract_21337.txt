BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa are often found together in the airways of cystic fibrosis  patients. it was previously shown that the p. aeruginosa exoproduct 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline-n-oxide  suppresses the growth of s. aureus and provokes the emergence of small-colony variants . the presence of s. aureus scvs as well as biofilms have both been associated with chronic infections in cf.


RESULTS
we demonstrated that hqno stimulates s. aureus to form a biofilm in association with the formation of scvs. the emergence of scvs and biofilm production under hqno exposure was shown to be dependent on the activity of the stress- and colonization-related alternative sigma factor b . analysis of gene expression revealed that exposure of a prototypical s. aureus strain to hqno activates sigb, which was leading to an increase in the expression of the fibronectin-binding protein a and the biofilm-associated sara genes. conversely, the quorum sensing accessory gene regulator  system and the Î±-hemolysin gene were repressed by hqno. experiments using culture supernatants from p. aeruginosa pao <dig> and a double chamber co-culture model confirmed that p. aeruginosa stimulates biofilm formation and activates sigb in a s. aureus strain isolated from a cf patient. furthermore, the supernatant from p. aeruginosa mutants unable to produce hqno induced the production of biofilms by s. aureus to a lesser extent than the wild-type strain only in a s. aureus sigb-functional background.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that s. aureus responds to hqno from p. aeruginosa by forming scvs and biofilms through sigb activation, a phenomenon that may contribute to the establishment of chronic infections in cf patients.
