BACKGROUND
gastric ulcers in fattening pigs from intensive pork production can cause sudden deaths on farm and the grinding intensity of the diet appears to be among the risk factors. the objective of this work is to adopt the latest laboratory tests and thresholds for the ulcerogenic risk assessment of diets from experimental reports and verify the class of risk in relation to gastric lesion prevalence in reared finishers.


RESULTS
specificity and accuracy of feed safety tests based on the ulcerogenic risk of feed associated with the particle size distribution of diets were calculated on the occurrence of gastric lesions observed at a slaughterhouse:  <dig> lard-type hogs, fed with two diets , analyzed at the laboratory of our institute, were involved. gross inspection at the abattoir allowed the identification of the development of macroscopic gastric lesions in the pigs  fed with a pelleted complete diet, ranked in class  <dig>  on laboratory assessment. breakdown of gastric lesion severity: hyperkeratosis , mucosal erosions  and bleeding ulcers . this occurrence was compared to the morphology of stomach mucosa from  <dig> finishers fed with a mixed meal diet, ranked in class  <dig> , in which no gastric lesions were observed. very fine particle  mass  according to cut off thresholds  for the safety ranking of diets, showed: 100% positive predictive value ; 100% specificity;  <dig> % accuracy;  <dig> % sensitivity.


CONCLUSIONS
three factors emerged: the elevated mass  of < <dig> Â mm particles in the pelleted complete diet confirmed the associated risk rank in class  <dig> assessed by laboratory procedures, as gastric lesions were selectively observed in  <dig> % of finishers fed with the high risk diet; in these animals, macroscopic gastric lesions occurred within four weeks and showed a sub-clinical course, independently of severity; proper sieving analysis is necessary to define the vfp proportion in feedstuffs with certainty, as an adequate measure to assess the ulcerogenic risk class of the diet.
