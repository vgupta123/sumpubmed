BACKGROUND
regulators of g protein signaling  accelerate gtp hydrolysis by gα subunits and profoundly inhibit signaling by g protein-coupled receptors . the distinct expression patterns and pathophysiologic regulation of rgs proteins suggest that inhibitors may have therapeutic potential. we recently described a focused one-bead, one-compound  library screen to identify peptide inhibitors of rgs <dig>  here we extend our observations to include another peptide with a different mechanism of action.


RESULTS
peptide 5nd  blocks the rgs4-gαo interaction with an ic <dig> of  <dig> μm. it forms a covalent, dithiothreitol  sensitive adduct with a mass consistent with the incorporation of one peptide per rgs. peptide 5nd activity is abolished by either changing its disulfide bridge to a methylene dithioether bridge, which cannot form disulfide bridges to the rgs, or by removing all cysteines from the rgs protein. however, no single cysteine in rgs <dig> is completely necessary or sufficient for 5nd activity.


CONCLUSIONS
though it has some rgs selectivity, 5nd appears to be a partially random cysteine modifier. these data suggest that it inhibits rgs <dig> by forming disulfide bridges with the protein.
