BACKGROUND
saliva of blood-sucking arthropods contains a cocktail of antihemostatic agents and immunomodulators that help blood feeding. mosquitoes additionally feed on sugar meals and have specialized regions of their glands containing glycosidases and antimicrobials that might help control bacterial growth in the ingested meals. to expand our knowledge on the salivary cocktail of Ædes ægypti, a vector of dengue and yellow fevers, we analyzed a set of  <dig>  expressed sequence tags from cdna libraries of adult female mosquitoes.


RESULTS
a nonredundant catalogue of  <dig> transcripts  is described, including  <dig> coding for proteins of a putative secretory nature. additionally, a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of salivary gland  homogenates followed by tryptic digestion of selected protein bands and ms/ms analysis revealed the expression of  <dig> proteins. analysis of tissue-specific transcription of a subset of these genes revealed at least  <dig> genes whose expression is specific or enriched in female sg, whereas  <dig> additional genes were expressed in female sg and in males but not in other female tissues. most of the  <dig> proteins coded by these sg transcripts have no known function and represent high-priority candidates for expression and functional analysis as antihemostatic or antimicrobial agents. an unexpected finding is the occurrence of four protein families specific to sg that were probably a product of horizontal transfer from prokaryotic organisms to mosquitoes.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, this paper contributes to the novel identification of  <dig> new transcripts, or near 3% of the Æ. ægypti proteome assuming a  <dig> -protein set, and to the best-described sialome of any blood-feeding insect.
