BACKGROUND
t-helper cell type  <dig>  polarization in chronic immune thrombocytopenia  has been reported at the protein and mrna levels. we evaluated the impact of th1/th <dig> cytokine and cytokine receptor functional polymorphisms on both susceptibility to, and severity of, citp. we analysed ifn-γ + 874 t/a, ifn-γr -611g/a, il- <dig> -590c/t, and il-4rα q576r polymorphisms in  <dig> citp patients  and  <dig> healthy control donors. genotyping was determined by pcr and direct sequencing. the th1/th <dig> ratio was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells via flow cytometry.


RESULTS
citp patients had a higher frequency of the il-4rα  <dig> non-qq genotype compared to healthy subjects . citp patients with the ifn-γ + <dig> non-aa genotype  showed more severe thrombocytopenia than those with the aa genotype . citp patients had a significantly higher th1/th <dig> ratio than control patients ; this ratio was inversely correlated with platelet counts. furthermore, patients with both ifn-γ + <dig> non-aa genotype  and ifn-γr − <dig> non-aa genotype  had a significantly higher th1/th <dig> ratio .


CONCLUSIONS
the cytokine polymorphisms affecting th1/th <dig> increase the susceptibility to, and severity of, chronic itp.
