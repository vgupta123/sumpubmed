BACKGROUND
thermotoga species are organisms of enormous interest from a biotechnological as well as evolutionary point of view. genetic modifications of thermotoga spp. are often desired in order to fully release their multifarious potentials. effective transformation of recombinant dna into these bacteria constitutes a critical step of such efforts. this study aims to establish natural competency in thermotoga spp. and to provide a convenient method to transform these organisms.


RESULTS
foreign dna was found to be relatively stable in the supernatant of a thermotoga culture for up to 6Â hours. adding donor dna to t. sp. strain rq <dig> at its early exponential growth phase  resulted in direct acquisition of the dna by the cells. both t. neapolitana chromosomal dna and thermotoga-e. coli shuttle vectors effectively transformed t. sp. strain rq <dig>  rendering the cells resistance to kanamycin. the kan gene carried by the shuttle vector pdh <dig> was detected by pcr from the plasmid extract of the transformants, and the amplicons were verified by restriction digestions. a procedure for natural transformation of thermotoga spp. was established and optimized. with the optimized method, t. sp. strain rq <dig> sustained a transformation frequency in the order of 10- <dig> with both genomic and plasmid dna.


CONCLUSIONS
t. sp. strain rq <dig> cells are naturally transformable during their early exponential phase. they acquire dna from both closely and distantly related species. both chromosomal dna and plasmid dna serve as suitable substrates for transformation. our findings lend a convenient technical tool for the genetic engineering of thermotoga spp.
