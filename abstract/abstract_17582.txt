BACKGROUND
myosin ic is a single headed member of the myosin superfamily that localizes to the cytoplasm and the nucleus and is implicated in a variety of processes in both compartments. we recently identified a novel isoform of myosin ic and showed that the myoic gene in mammalian cells encodes three isoforms  that differ only in the addition of short isoform-specific n-terminal peptides. the expression pattern of the isoforms and the mechanisms of expression regulation remain unknown.


RESULTS
to determine the expression patterns of myosin ic isoforms, we performed a comprehensive expression analysis of the two myosin ic isoforms  that contain isoform-specific sequences. by immunoblotting with isoform-specific antibodies and by qrt-pcr with isoform-specific primer we demonstrate that myosin ic isoforms a and b have distinct expression patterns in mouse tissues. specifically, we show that myosin ic isoform a is expressed in a tissue specific pattern, while myosin ic isoform b is ubiquitously expressed at comparable levels in mouse tissues.


CONCLUSIONS
the differences in the expression profile of the myosin ic isoforms indicate a tissue-specific myoic gene regulation and further suggest that the myosin ic isoforms, despite their high sequence homology, might have tissue-specific and isoform-specific functions.
