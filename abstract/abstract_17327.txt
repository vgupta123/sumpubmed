BACKGROUND
klebsiella pneumoniae displaying the hypermucoviscosity  phenotype are considered more virulent than hv-negative strains. nevertheless, the emergence of tissue-abscesses-associated hv-negative isolates motivated us to re-evaluate the role of hv-phenotype.


RESULTS
instead of genetically manipulating the hv-phenotype of k. pneumoniae, we selected two clinically isolated k <dig> strains,  <dig>  and  <dig> , to avoid possible interference from defects in the capsule. these well-encapsulated strains with similar genetic backgrounds were used for comparative analysis of bacterial virulence in a pneumoniae or a liver abscess model generated in either naïve or diabetic mice. in the pneumonia model, the hv-positive strain  <dig> proliferated to higher loads in the lungs and blood of naïve mice, but was less prone to disseminate into the blood of diabetic mice compared to the hv-negative strain  <dig>  in the liver abscess model,  <dig> was as potent as  <dig> in inducing liver abscesses in both the naïve and diabetic mice. the 1084-infected diabetic mice were more inclined to develop bacteremia and had a higher mortality rate than those infected by  <dig>  a mini-tn <dig> mutant of  <dig>  isolated due to its loss of hv-phenotype, was avirulent to mice.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that the hv-phenotype is required for the virulence of the clinically isolated hv-positive strain  <dig>  the superior ability of the hv-negative stain  <dig> over  <dig> to cause bacteremia in diabetic mice suggests that factors other than the hv phenotype were required for the systemic dissemination of k. pneumoniae in an immunocompromised setting.
