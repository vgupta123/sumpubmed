BACKGROUND
in the present investigation, we have used an exhaustive metabolite profiling approach to search for biomarkers in recombinant aspergillus nidulans  for application in metabolic engineering.


RESULTS
more than  <dig> metabolites were detected and subsequently used in the analysis. our approach consists of two analytical steps of the metabolic profiling data, an initial non-linear unsupervised analysis with self-organizing maps  to identify similarities and differences among the metabolic profiles of the studied strains, followed by a second, supervised analysis for training a classifier based on the selected biomarkers. our analysis identified seven putative biomarkers that were able to cluster the samples according to their genotype. a support vector machine was subsequently employed to construct a predictive model based on the seven biomarkers, capable of distinguishing correctly  <dig> out of the  <dig> samples of the different a. nidulans strains.


CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates that it is possible to use metabolite profiling for the classification of filamentous fungi as well as for the identification of metabolic engineering targets and draws the attention towards the development of a common database for storage of metabolomics data.
