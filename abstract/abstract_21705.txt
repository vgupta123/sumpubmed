BACKGROUND
human genetic variations primarily result from single nucleotide polymorphisms  that occur approximately every  <dig> bases in the overall human population. the non-synonymous snps  that lead to amino acid changes in the protein product may account for nearly half of the known genetic variations linked to inherited human diseases. one of the key problems of medical genetics today is to identify nssnps that underlie disease-related phenotypes in humans. as such, the development of computational tools that can identify such nssnps would enhance our understanding of genetic diseases and help predict the disease.


RESULTS
we propose a method, named parepro , to identify nssnps having either deleterious or neutral effects on the resulting protein function. two independent datasets, humvar and newhumvar, taken from the phd-snp server, were applied to train the model and test the robustness of parepro. using a 20-fold cross validation test on the humvar dataset, parepro achieved a matthews correlation coefficient  of 50% and an overall accuracy  of 76%, both of which were higher than those predicted by the methods, such as polyphen, sift, and hydridmeth. further analysis on an additional dataset  using parepro yielded similar results.


CONCLUSIONS
the performance of parepro indicates that it is a powerful tool for predicting the effect of nssnps on protein function and would be useful for large-scale analysis of genomic nssnp data.
