BACKGROUND
formation and repair of dna single-strand breaks are important parameters in the assessment of dna damage and repair occurring in live cells. the 'fluorimetric detection of alkaline dna unwinding ' method  is a sensitive procedure to quantify dna strand breaks, yet it is very tedious to perform.


RESULTS
in order  to render the fadu assay more convenient and robust,  to increase throughput, and  to reduce the number of cells needed, we have established a modified assay version that is largely automated and is based on the use of a liquid handling device. the assay is operated in a 96-well format, thus greatly increasing throughput. the number of cells required has been reduced to less than  <dig>  per data point. the threshold for detection of x-ray-induced dna strand breaks is  <dig>  gy. the total assay time required for a typical experiment to assess dna strand break repair is 4â€“ <dig> hours.


CONCLUSIONS
we have established a robust and convenient method measuring of formation and repair of dna single-strand breaks in live cells. while the sensitivity of our method is comparable to current assays, throughput is massively increased while operator time is decreased.
