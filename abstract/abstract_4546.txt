BACKGROUND
severe autoinflammatory diseases are associated with mutations in the foxp <dig> locus in both mice and humans. foxp <dig> is required for the development, function, and maintenance of regulatory t cells , a subset of cd <dig> cells that suppress t cell activation and inflammatory processes. siva is a pro-apoptotic gene that is expressed across a range of tissues, including cd <dig> t cells. siva interacts with three tumor necrosis factor receptor  family members that are constitutively expressed on treg cells: cd <dig>  gitr, and ox <dig> 


RESULTS
here we report a biophysical interaction between foxp <dig> and siva. we mapped the interaction domains to siva's c-terminus and to a central region of foxp <dig>  we showed that siva repressed il- <dig> induction by suppressing il- <dig> promoter activity during t cell activation. siva-1's repressive effect on il- <dig> gene expression appears to be mediated by inhibition of nfkappab, whereas foxp <dig> repressed both nfkappab and nfat activity.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our data suggest that both foxp <dig> and siva function as negative regulators of il- <dig> gene expression in treg cells, via suppression of nfat by foxp <dig> and of nfkappab by both foxp <dig> and siva. our work contributes evidence for siva's role as a t cell signalling mediator in addition to its known pro-apoptotic function. though further investigations are needed, evidence for the biophysical interaction between foxp <dig> and siva invites the possibility that siva may be important for proper treg cell function.
