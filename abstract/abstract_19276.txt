BACKGROUND
the discovery of functional non-coding rna sequences has led to an increasing interest in algorithms related to rna analysis. traditional sequence alignment algorithms, however, fail at computing reliable alignments of low-homology rna sequences. the spatial conformation of rna sequences largely determines their function, and therefore rna alignment algorithms have to take structural information into account.


RESULTS
we present a graph-based representation for sequence-structure alignments, which we model as an integer linear program . we sketch how we compute an optimal or near-optimal solution to the ilp using methods from combinatorial optimization, and present results on a recently published benchmark set for rna alignments.


CONCLUSIONS
the implementation of our algorithm yields better alignments in terms of two published scores than the other programs that we tested: this is especially the case with an increasing number of input sequences. our program lara is freely available for academic purposes from .
