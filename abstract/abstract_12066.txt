BACKGROUND
the nontoxigenic v. cholerae el tor strains ferment sorbitol faster than the toxigenic strains, hence fast-fermenting and slow-fermenting strains are defined by sorbitol fermentation test. this test has been used for more than  <dig> years in cholera surveillance and strain analysis in china. understanding of the mechanisms of sorbitol metabolism of the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains may help to explore the genome and metabolism divergence in these strains. here we used comparative proteomic analysis to find the proteins which may be involved in such metabolic difference.


RESULTS
we found the production of formate and lactic acid in the sorbitol fermentation medium of the nontoxigenic strain was earlier than of the toxigenic strain. we compared the protein expression profiles of the toxigenic strain n <dig> and nontoxigenic strain js <dig> cultured in sorbitol fermentation medium, by using fructose fermentation medium as the control. seventy-three differential protein spots were found and further identified by maldi-ms. the difference of product of fructose-specific iia/fpr component gene and mannitol-1-p dehydrogenase, may be involved in the difference of sorbitol transportation and dehydrogenation in the sorbitol fast- and slow-fermenting strains. the difference of the relative transcription levels of pyruvate formate-lyase to pyruvate dehydrogenase between the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains may be also responsible for the time and ability difference of formate production between these strains.


CONCLUSIONS
multiple factors involved in different metabolism steps may affect the sorbitol fermentation in the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains of v. cholerae el tor.
