BACKGROUND
this study aimed to evaluate the clinical, haematological and biochemical responses to autologous blood transfusion and the feasibility of this practice in sheep. thus, we used eight male, 8 months old sheep, weighing on average 30 kg, from which 15 ml/kg of whole blood was collected and stored in cpda- <dig> bags. blood samples were refrigerated for 8 days and subsequently re-infused. the clinical, haematological and biochemical parameters were evaluated before blood collection and reinfusion, after  <dig> minutes of collection and reinfusion, after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after collection and reinfusion.


RESULTS
with respect to clinical parameters, we observed a decrease in heart rate after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours from reinfusion compared to basal values . haematological variables including globular volume and erythrocyte counts showed a significant decrease  at all time points after collection and increased  at all time points after reinfusion. there was a significant increase in total protein and calcium at all time points after reinfusion .


CONCLUSIONS
autologous transfusion in sheep slightly altered the physiological, biochemical and haematological responses of sheep, indicating that the technique proposed is safe and can be applied in the clinical practice of this species. the  <dig> d period was not sufficient for complete recovery of the haematological parameters after blood collection.
