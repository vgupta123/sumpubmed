BACKGROUND
wolbachia endosymbiotic bacteria are capable of inducing chronic upregulation of insect immune genes in some situations and this phenotype may influence the transmission of important insect-borne pathogens. however the molecules involved in these interactions have not been characterized. 


RESULTS
 here we show that recombinant wolbachia surface protein  stimulates increased transcription of immune genes in mosquito cells derived from the mosquito anopheles gambiae, which is naturally uninfected with wolbachia; at least two of the upregulated genes, tep <dig> and apl <dig>  are known to be important in plasmodium killing in this species. when cells from aedes albopictus, which is naturally wolbachia-infected, were challenged with wsp lower levels of upregulation were observed than for the an. gambiae cells. 


CONCLUSIONS
 we have found that wsp is a strong immune elicitor in a naturally wolbachia-uninfected mosquito species  while a milder elicitor in a naturally-infected species . since the wsp of a mosquito non-native  wolbachia strain was used, these data suggest that there is a generalized tolerance to wsp in ae. albopictus.
