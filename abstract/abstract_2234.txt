BACKGROUND
c-jun nh2-terminal kinase/stress-activated kinase  and the p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase  are important components of cellular signal transduction pathways, which have been reported to be involved in viral replication. however, little is known about jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk signaling pathways in enterovirus  <dig> -infected immature dendritic cells . thus, idcs were induced from peripheral blood mononuclear cells  and performed to explore the expressions and phosphorylation of molecules in the two signaling pathways as well as secretions of inflammatory cytokines and interferons during ev <dig> replication.


RESULTS
we showed that ev <dig> infection could activate both jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk in idcs and phosphorylate their downstream transcription factors c-fos and c-jun, which further promoted the production of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α. moreover, ev <dig> infection also increased the release of ifn-β and il- <dig> p <dig>  pretreatment of idcs with sp <dig> and sb <dig>  could severely impair viral replication and its induced phosphorylation of jnk1/ <dig> p <dig> mapk, c-fos and c-jun. in addition, treatment of ev71-infected idcs with sp <dig> and sb <dig> could inhibit secretions of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tnf-α.


CONCLUSIONS
jnk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk signaling pathways are beneficial to ev <dig> infection and positively regulate secretions of inflammatory cytokines in idcs.
