BACKGROUND
microsatellites or simple sequence repeats  in expressed sequence tags  are useful resources for genome analysis because of their abundance, functionality and polymorphism. the advent of commercial second generation sequencing machines has lead to new strategies for developing est-ssr markers, necessitating the development of bioinformatic framework that can keep pace with the increasing quality and quantity of sequence data produced. we describe an open scheme for analyzing ests and developing est-ssr markers from reads collected by sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing of sugi .


RESULTS
we collected  <dig>  sequence reads by sanger sequencing and  <dig> , <dig> by pyrosequencing. after trimming contaminant and low quality sequences,  <dig>  sanger and  <dig> , <dig> pyrosequencing reads were passed to the mira assembler, generating  <dig>  contigs that were analysed for ssrs.  <dig>  ssrs were found in  <dig>   contigs, giving an ssr frequency lower than that in seven other plant species with gene indices . the average gc content of the ssr-containing contigs was  <dig> %, compared to  <dig> % for all contigs. tri-ssrs were the most common ssrs; the most common motif was at, which was found in  <dig>  di-ssrs, followed by the aag motif, found in  <dig>  tri-ssrs. most  tri-ssrs were in coding regions, but  <dig> % of the di-ssrs were in non-coding regions; the at motif was most abundant in 3′ untranslated regions. gene ontology  annotations showed that six go terms were significantly overrepresented within ssr-containing contigs. forty–four est-ssr markers were developed from  <dig> primer pairs using two pipelines: read2marker and the newly-developed cmib, which combines several open tools. markers resulting from both pipelines showed no differences in pcr success rate and polymorphisms, but pcr success and polymorphism were significantly affected by the expected pcr product size and number of ssr repeats, respectively. est-ssr markers exhibited less polymorphism than genomic ssrs.


CONCLUSIONS
we have created a new open pipeline for developing est-ssr markers and applied it in a comprehensive analysis of est-ssrs and est-ssr markers in c. japonica. the results will be useful in genomic analyses of conifers and other non-model species.
