BACKGROUND
the development of microarray resources for the chicken is an important step in being able to profile gene expression changes occurring in birds in response to different challenges and stimuli. the creation of an immune-related array is highly valuable in determining the host immune response in relation to infection with a wide variety of bacterial and viral diseases.


RESULTS
here we report the development of chicken immune-related cdna libraries and the subsequent construction of a microarray containing  <dig> elements . clones on the array originate from tissues known to contain high levels of cells related to the immune system, namely bursa, peyers patch, thymus and spleen. represented on the array are genes that are known to cluster with existing chicken ests as well as genes that are unique to our libraries. some of these genes have no known homologies and represent novel genes in the chicken collection. a series of reference genes  are also present on the array. functional annotation data is also provided for as many of the genes on the array as is possible.


CONCLUSIONS
six new chicken immune cdna libraries have been created and nearly  <dig>  sequences submitted to genbank . a  <dig> k immune-related array has been developed from these libraries. individual clones and arrays are available from the ark-genomics resource centre.
