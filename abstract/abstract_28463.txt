BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a family of small, non-coding single-stranded rna molecules involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. as such, they are believed to play a role in regulating the step-wise changes in gene expression patterns that occur during cell fate specification of multipotent stem cells. here, we have studied whether terminal differentiation of c2c <dig> myoblasts is indeed controlled by lineage-specific changes in mirna expression.


RESULTS
using a previously generated rna polymerase ii  chip-on-chip dataset, we show differential pol-ii occupancy at the promoter regions of six mirnas during c2c <dig> myogenic versus bmp2-induced osteogenic differentiation. overexpression of one of these mirnas, mir- <dig>  enhances alp activity, calcium deposition and mrna expression of osteogenic marker genes in the presence of bmp <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate a previously unknown role for mir- <dig> in promoting bmp2-induced osteogenic differentiation.
