BACKGROUND
organoselenium compounds have antimicrobial activity against some bacteria and fungi; furthermore, the antioxidant activity of diselenides has been demonstrated. the aim of the present work was to examine the in vitro minimal inhibitory concentration of a panel of differently substituted diselenides and their effectiveness in inhibiting biofilm formation and dispersing preformed microbial biofilm of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa and the yeast candida albicans, all involved in wound infections. moreover, the cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined in human dermal fibroblast and keratinocytes. in closing, we tested their direct antioxidant activity.


RESULTS
diselenides showed different antimicrobial activity, depending on the microorganism. all diselenides demonstrated a good antibiofilm activity against s. aureus and s. epidermidis, the compounds camphor diselenide, bis and bis were active against s. pyogenes and c. albicans biofilm while only diselenides  <dig> ’-diselenidyldibenzoic acid and bis were effective against p. aeruginosa. moreover, the compounds bis and bis showed an antioxidant activity at concentrations lower than the 50 % of cytotoxic concentration.


CONCLUSIONS
because microbial biofilms are implicated in chronic infection of wounds and treatment failure, the combination of antimicrobial activity and potential radical scavenging effects may contribute to the improvement of wound healing. therefore, this study suggests that bis and bis are promising compounds to be used in preventing and treating microbial wound infections.
