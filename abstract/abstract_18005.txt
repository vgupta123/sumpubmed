BACKGROUND
the gilthead sea bream  is the main fish species cultured in the mediterranean area and constitutes an interesting model of research. nevertheless, transcriptomic and genomic data are still scarce for this highly valuable species. a transcriptome database was constructed by de novo assembly of gilthead sea bream sequences derived from public repositories of mrna and collections of expressed sequence tags together with new high-quality reads from five cdna  <dig> normalized libraries of skeletal muscle , intestine , head kidney  and blood .


RESULTS
sequencing of the new  <dig> normalized libraries produced  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads and the de novo global assembly yielded  <dig>  unique sequences with an average length of  <dig> nt. blast analysis directed to protein and nucleotide databases annotated  <dig>  sequences encoding for  <dig>  gene descriptions, that were curated for redundancies and frameshifting at the homopolymer regions of open reading frames, and hosted at http://www.nutrigroup-iats.org/seabreamdb. among the annotated gene descriptions,  <dig>  were mapped in the ingenuity pathway analysis  database, and  <dig>  were eligible for functional analysis with a representation in  <dig> out of  <dig> ipa canonical pathways. the high representation of randomly selected stickleback transcripts by blast search in the nucleotide gilthead sea bream database evidenced its high coverage of protein-coding transcripts.


CONCLUSIONS
the newly assembled gilthead sea bream transcriptome represents a progress in genomic resources for this species, as it probably contains more than 75% of actively transcribed genes, constituting a valuable tool to assist studies on functional genomics and future genome projects.
