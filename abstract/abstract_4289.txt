BACKGROUND
pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes is required for normal chromosome segregation and the exchange of genetic material via recombination during meiosis. synapsis is complete at pachytene following the formation of a tri-partite proteinaceous structure known as the synaptonemal complex . in yeast, hop <dig> is essential for formation of the sc, and localises along chromosome axes during prophase i. homologues in arabidopsis , brassica  and rice  have been isolated through analysis of mutants that display decreased fertility due to severely reduced synapsis of homologous chromosomes. analysis of these genes has indicated that they play a similar role to hop <dig> in pairing and formation of the sc through localisation to axial/lateral elements of the sc.


RESULTS
the full length wheat cdna and genomic clone, taasy <dig>  has been isolated, sequenced and characterised. taasy <dig> is located on chromosome group  <dig> and the open reading frame displays significant nucleotide sequence identity to ospair <dig>  and atasy <dig> . transcript and protein analysis showed that expression is largely restricted to meiotic tissue, with elevated levels during the stages of prophase i when pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes occur. immunolocalisation using transmission electron microscopy showed taasy <dig> interacts with chromatin that is associated with both axial elements before sc formation as well as lateral elements of formed scs.


CONCLUSIONS
taasy <dig> is a homologue of schop <dig>  atasy <dig> and ospair <dig> and is the first gene to be isolated from bread wheat that is involved in pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes.
