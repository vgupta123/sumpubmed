BACKGROUND
the aim of this study is to examine the influence of the catechol-o-methyltranferase  gene  as a risk factor for alzheimer's disease  and mild cognitive impairment of amnesic type , and its synergistic effect with the apolipoprotein e gene .

a total of  <dig> mci patients,  <dig> ad and  <dig> healthy controls were analyzed. clinical criteria and neuropsychological tests were used to establish diagnostic groups.

the dna bank of the university of the basque country   determined comt val <dig> met and apoe genotypes using real time polymerase chain reaction  and polymerase chain reaction , and restriction fragment length polymorphism , respectively. multinomial logistic regression models were used to determine the risk of ad and mci.


RESULTS
neither comt alleles nor genotypes were independent risk factors for ad or mci. the high activity genotypes  showed a synergistic effect with apoe ε <dig> allele, increasing the risk of ad . in ad patients this effect was greater in women.

in mci patients such as synergistic effect was only found between ag and apoe ε <dig> allele  and was greater in men .


CONCLUSIONS
comt  polymorphism is not an independent risk factor for ad or mci, but shows a synergistic effect with apoe ε <dig> allele that proves greater in women with ad.
