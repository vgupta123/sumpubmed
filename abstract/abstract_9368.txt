BACKGROUND
a transposable element  is a dna fragment that can change its position within a genome. transposable elements play important roles in maintaining the stability and diversity of organisms by transposition. recent studies have shown that approximately half of the genes in bombyx mori are tes.


RESULTS
we systematically identified and analyzed the bmago2-associated tes, which exceed  <dig> in the b. mori genome. additionally, we also mapped the small rnas associated with bmago <dig> in b.mori. the transposon bm <dig> is the most abundant te associated with bmago <dig>  and bm1645-derived small rnas represent a small rna pool. we determined the expression patterns of several bm1645-derived small rnas by northern blotting, and the results showed there was differential expression of multiple small rnas in normal and bmnpv-infected bmn cells and silkworms from various developmental stages. we confirmed that four te-sirnas could bind to bmago <dig> using emsa and also validated the recognition sites of these four te-sirnas in bm <dig> by dual-luciferase reporter assays. furthermore, qrt-pcr analysis revealed the overexpression of the four te-sirnas could downregulate the expression of bm <dig> in bmn cells, and the transcription of bm <dig> was upregulated by the downregulation of bmago <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest bm <dig> functions as a source of small rnas pool and this pool can produce many bmago2-associated small rnas that regulate te’s expression.
