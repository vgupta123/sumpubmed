BACKGROUND
vibrio parahaemolyticus is a main causative agent of serious human seafood-borne gastroenteritis disease. many researchers have investigated its pathogenesis by observing the alteration of its virulence factors in different conditions. it was previously known that culture conditions will influence the gene expression and the metabolic profile of v. parahaemolyticus, but little attention has been paid on the relationship between them. in this study, for the first time, the metabolomics response in relation to the expression of two major virulence genes, tdh and trh, induced at three temperatures  was examined in two genotypes of pathogenic vibrio parahaemolyticus  and atcc <dig> ).


RESULTS
reverse transcription real-time pcr  analysis illustrated that the expression levels of tdh and trh induced at 25 °c in v. parahaemolyticus were significantly higher than those induced at  <dig> and 37 °c. principal components analysis  based on the uplc & q-tof ms data presented clearly distinct groups among the samples treated by different temperatures. metabolic profiling demonstrated that  <dig> of  <dig>  kinds of identified metabolites in atcc <dig> changed significantly  upon culturing at different temperatures, meanwhile  <dig> of  <dig> kinds of metabolites changed  in atcc <dig>  pearson’s correlation analysis highlighted the correlation between metabolites and virulence gene expression levels. at the threshold of | r | =  <dig>  p < <dig> ,  <dig> kinds of metabolites showed extremely significant correlations with tdh expression, and  <dig> kinds of metabolites significantly correlated with trh expression. it is interesting that 3d, 7d, 11d-phytanic acid showed the same trend with pyrophosphate, whose derivative could activate the degradation of phytanic acid. several metabolites could be sorted into the same class by the method of chemical taxonomy, by assuming that they are involved in the same metabolic pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
this research can help to find biomarkers to monitor virulence gene expression, and can further help laboratory and clinical research of v. parahaemolyticus from the perspective of metabolomics.
