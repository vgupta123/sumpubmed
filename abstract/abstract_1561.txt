BACKGROUND
an important feature that emerges from analyzing gene regulatory networks is the "switch-like behavior" or "bistability", a dynamic feature of a particular gene to preferentially toggle between two steady-states. the state of gene switches plays pivotal roles in cell fate decision, but identifying switches has been difficult. therefore a challenge confronting the field is to be able to systematically identify gene switches.


RESULTS
we propose a top-down mining approach to exploring gene switches on a genome-scale level. theoretical analysis, proof-of-concept examples, and experimental studies demonstrate the ability of our mining approach to identify bistable genes by sampling across a variety of different conditions. applying the approach to human breast cancer data identified genes that show bimodality within the cancer samples, such as estrogen receptor  and erbb <dig>  as well as genes that show bimodality between cancer and non-cancer samples, where tumor-associated calcium signal transducer  <dig>  is uncovered. we further suggest a likely transcription factor that regulates tacstd <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our mining approach demonstrates that one can capitalize on genome-wide expression profiling to capture dynamic properties of a complex network. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in applying mining approaches to explore gene switches on a genome-scale, and the identification of tacstd <dig> demonstrates that single cell-level bistability can be predicted from microarray data. experimental confirmation of the computational results suggest tacstd <dig> could be a potential biomarker and attractive candidate for drug therapy against both er+ and er- subtypes of breast cancer, including the triple negative subtype.
