BACKGROUND
identifying pockets on protein surfaces is of great importance for many structure-based drug design applications and protein-ligand docking algorithms. over the last ten years, many geometric methods for the prediction of ligand-binding sites have been developed.


RESULTS
we present ligsitecsc, an extension and implementation of the ligsite algorithm. ligsitecsc is based on the notion of surface-solvent-surface events and the degree of conservation of the involved surface residues. we compare our algorithm to four other approaches, ligsite, cast, pass, and surfnet, and evaluate all on a dataset of  <dig> unbound/bound structures and  <dig> bound-structures. ligsitecsc performs slightly better than the other tools and achieves a success rate of 71% and 75%, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the use of the connolly surface leads to slight improvements, the prediction re-ranking by conservation to significant improvements of the binding site predictions. a web server for ligsitecsc and its source code is available at scoppi.biotec.tu-dresden.de/pocket.
