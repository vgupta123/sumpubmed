BACKGROUND
the salivary mucin muc <dig>  can adhere to various strains of streptococci that are primary colonizers and predominant microorganisms of the oral cavity. although there is a growing interest in interaction between oral pathogens and salivary mucins, studies reporting the specific binding sites on the bacteria are rather limited. identification and characterization of the specific interacting proteins on the bacterial cell surface, termed adhesins, are crucial to further understand host-pathogen interactions.


RESULTS
we demonstrate here, using purified muc <dig> to overlay blots of sds-extracts of streptococcus gordonii cell surface proteins,  <dig> muc7-binding bands, with apparent molecular masses of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kda from the streptococcus gordonii strain, pk <dig>  putative adhesins were identified by in-gel digestion and subsequent nanolc-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of resultant peptides. the  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda bands were identified as elongation factor  tu and ef-g respectively. the  <dig> kda band was a hppa gene product; the  <dig> kda oligopeptide-binding lipoprotein. the  <dig> kda band contained two proteins; alpha enolase and dna-directed rna polymerase, beta' subunit. some of these proteins, for example alpha enolase are expected to be intracellular, however, flow cytometric analysis confirmed its location on the bacterial surface.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrated that s. gordonii expressed a number of putative muc <dig> recognizing proteins and these contribute to muc <dig> mucin binding of this streptococcal strain.
