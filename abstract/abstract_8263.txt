BACKGROUND
recent studies have shown that copy number variation  in mammalian genomes contributes to phenotypic diversity, including health and disease status. in domestic pigs, cnv has been catalogued by several reports, but the extent of cnv and the phenotypic effects are far from clear. the goal of this study was to identify cnv regions  in pigs based on array comparative genome hybridization .


RESULTS
here a custom-made tiling oligo-nucleotide array was used with a median probe spacing of  <dig> bp for screening  <dig> pigs including  <dig> chinese native pigs ,  <dig> european pigs ,  <dig> synthetic pigs  and  <dig> crossbred pigs  with a duroc pig as the reference. two hundred and fifty-nine cnvrs across chromosomes 1â€“ <dig> and x were identified, with an average size of  <dig>  kb and a median size of  <dig>  kb, covering  <dig>  mb or  <dig> % of the whole genome. concerning copy number status,  <dig>  cnvrs were called as gains,  <dig>  were called as losses and the remaining  <dig>  were called as both gains and losses. of all detected cnvrs,  <dig>  and  <dig>  cnvrs directly overlapped with sus scrofa duplicated sequences and pig qtls, respectively. the cnvrs encompassed  <dig> full length ensembl transcripts. two cnvrs identified by acgh were validated using real-time quantitative pcr .


CONCLUSIONS
using  <dig> k array cgh  we described a map of porcine cnvs which facilitated the identification of structural variations for important phenotypes and the assessment of the genetic diversity of pigs.
