BACKGROUND
large collections of paraffin-embedded tissue represent a rich resource to test hypotheses based on gene expression patterns; however, measurement of genome-wide expression is cost-prohibitive on a large scale. using the known expression correlation structure within a given disease type , we sought to identify reduced sets of directly measured  genes which could accurately predict the expression of a maximized number of unmeasured genes.


RESULTS
we developed a greedy gene set selection  algorithm which returns a dm set of user specified size based on a specific correlation threshold  and minimum number of dm genes that must be correlated to an unmeasured gene in order to infer the value of the unmeasured gene . we evaluated ggs in the cancer genome atlas  hgsc data across  <dig> combinations of dm size, redundancy , and |rp| . across the parameter sweep, ggs allows on average  <dig> times more gene expression information to be captured compared to the dm set alone. ggs successfully augments prognostic hgsc gene sets; the addition of  <dig> ggs selected genes more than doubles the number of genes whose expression is predictable. moreover, the expression prediction is highly accurate. after training regression models for the predictable gene set using 2/ <dig> of the tcga data, the average accuracy  in the 1/ <dig> testing partition and four independent populations is above  <dig>  and approaches  <dig>  for conservative parameter sets. we observe similar accuracies in the tcga hgsc rna-sequencing data. specifically, the prediction accuracy increases with increasing redundancy and increasing |rp|.


CONCLUSIONS
ggs-selected genes, which maximize expression information about unmeasured genes, can be combined with candidate gene sets as a cost effective way to increase the amount of gene expression information obtained in large studies. this method can be applied to any organism, model system, disease, or tissue type for which whole genome gene expression data exists.
