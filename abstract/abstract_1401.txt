BACKGROUND
since the identification of bri <dig> , a brassinosteroids  receptor, most of the critical roles of br in plant development have been assessed using various bri <dig> mutant alleles. the characterization of individual bri <dig> mutants has shown that both the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of bri <dig> are important to its proper functioning. particularly, in the extracellular domain, regions near the 70-amino acid island are known to be critical to br binding. in comparison, the exact function of the leucine rich-repeats  region located before the 70-amino acid island domain in the extracellular cellular portion of bri <dig> has not yet been described, due to a lack of specific mutant alleles.


RESULTS
among the mutants showing altered growth patterns compared to wild type, we further characterized cp <dig>  which displayed defective growth and reduced br sensitivity. we sequenced the genomic dna spanning bri <dig> in the cp <dig> and found that cp <dig> has a point mutation in the region encoding the 13th lrr of bri <dig>  resulting in a change from serine to phenylalanine . we renamed it bri1- <dig>  we also showed that overexpression of the wild type bri <dig> protein rescued the phenotype of bri1- <dig>  using a gfp-tagged bri1- <dig> construct, we detected the bri1- <dig> protein in the plasma membrane, and showed that the phenotypic defects in the rosette leaves of bri1- <dig>  a kinase-inactive weak allele of bri <dig>  can be restored by the overexpression of the bri1- <dig> proteins in bri1- <dig>  we also produced bri1- <dig> mutants that were wild type in appearance by performing a genetic cross between bri1- <dig> and bri1- <dig> plants.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified a new bri <dig> allele, bri1- <dig>  whose mutation site has not yet been found or characterized. our results indicated that the extracellular lrr regions before the 70-amino acid island domain of bri <dig> are important for the appropriate cellular functioning of bri <dig>  also, we confirmed that a successful interallelic complementation occurs between the extracellular domain mutant allele and the cytoplasmic kinase-inactive mutant allele of bri <dig> in vivo.
