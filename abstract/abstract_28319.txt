BACKGROUND
thymidine kinase  <dig>  is a salvage enzyme involved in dna precursor synthesis, and its expression is proliferation dependent. a serum form of tk <dig> has been used as a biomarker in human medicine for many years and more recently to monitor canine lymphoma. canine tk <dig> has not been cloned and studied. therefore, dog and human tk <dig> cdna were cloned and expressed, and the recombinant enzymes characterized. the serum and cellular forms of canine and human tk <dig> were studied by size-exclusion chromatography and the level of tk <dig> protein was determined using polyclonal and monoclonal anti-tk <dig> antibodies.


RESULTS
canine tk <dig> phosphorylated the thymidine  analog 3'-azido-thymidine  as efficiently as it did dthd, whereas azt phosphorylation by human tk <dig> was less efficient than that of dthd. dog tk <dig> was also more thermostable and ph tolerant than the human enzyme. oligomeric forms were observed with both enzymes in addition to the tetrameric and dimeric forms. cellular tk <dig> was predominantly seen in dimeric and tetrameric forms, in the case of both dog tk <dig> from mdck cells and human tk <dig> from cem cells. active serum tk <dig> was found mainly in a high molecular weight form, and treatment with a reducing agent shifted the high molecular weight complex to lower molecular weight forms with reduced total activity. western blot analysis demonstrated a polypeptide of 26 kda  and 25 kda  for cellular and serum tk <dig>  there was no direct correlation between serum tk <dig> activity and protein level. it appears that a substantial fraction of serum tk <dig> is not enzymatically active.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that the serum tk <dig> protein differs from cellular or recombinant forms, is more active in high molecular weight complexes, and is sensitive to reducing agents. the results presented here provide important information for the future development and use of serum tk <dig> as a diagnostic biomarker in human and veterinary medicine.
