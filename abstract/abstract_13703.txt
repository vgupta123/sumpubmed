BACKGROUND
as both abiotic stress response and development are under redox control, it was hypothesised that the pharmacological modification of the redox environment would affect the initial development of flower primordia and freezing tolerance in wheat .


RESULTS
pharmacologically induced redox changes were monitored in winter  and spring  wheat genotypes grown after germination at 20/17°c for  <dig> d , then at 5°c for  <dig> d  and subsequently at 20/17°c for  <dig> d . thiols and their disulphide forms were measured and based on these data reduction potentials were calculated. in the freezing-tolerant ch the chemical treatments generally increased both the amount of thiol disulphides and the reduction potential after  <dig> days at 20/17°c. in the freezing-sensitive tsp a similar effect of the chemicals on these parameters was only observed after the continuation of the treatments for  <dig> days at 5°c. the applied chemicals slightly decreased root fresh weight and increased freezing tolerance in ch, whereas they increased shoot fresh weight in tsp after  <dig> days at 5°c. as shown after the 3-week recovery at 20/17°c, the initial development of flower primordia was accelerated in tsp, whereas it was not affected by the treatments in ch. the chemicals differently affected the expression of zcct <dig> and that of several other genes related to freezing tolerance and initial development of flower primordia in ch and tsp after  <dig> d at 5°c.


CONCLUSIONS
various redox-altering compounds and osmotica had differential effects on glutathione disulphide content and reduction potential, and consequently on the expression of the flowering repressor zcct <dig> in the winter wheat ch and the spring wheat tsp. we propose that the higher expression of zcct <dig> in ch may be associated with activation of genes of cold acclimation and its lower expression in tsp with the induction of genes accelerating initial development of flower primordia. in addition, zcct <dig> may be involved in the coordinated control of the two processes.
