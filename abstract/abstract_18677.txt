BACKGROUND
development of the secondary palate  is a complex event and abnormalities during sp development can lead to cleft palate, one of the most common birth disorders. matrix metalloproteinases  are required for proper sp development, although a functional role for any one mmp in sp development remains unknown. mmp- <dig> may have a functional role in sp formation as genetic scans of the dna of human cleft palate patients indicate a common mutation at a region upstream of the mmp- <dig> gene. we report on the gene expression profile of mmp- <dig> in the developing mouse sp and identify its functional role in mouse sp development.


RESULTS
mmp- <dig> mrna and protein are found at all sp developmental stages in mice, with the highest expression at embryonic day   <dig> . immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization localize mmp- <dig> protein and mrna, respectively, to the apical palate shelf epithelial cells and apical mesenchyme. mmp- <dig> knockdown with sirna in palatal cultures results in a significant decrease in palate shelf fusion and persistence of the medial edge epithelium. mmp- <dig> mrna and protein levels significantly decrease when cultured palate shelves are incubated in growth medium with  <dig> μg/ml of a tgf-β3-neutralizing antibody.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate:  mmp- <dig> gene expression is highest at e <dig>  and e <dig> , which corresponds with increasing palate shelf growth downward alongside the tongue;  mmp- <dig> protein and mrna expression predominantly localize in the apical epithelium of the palate shelves, but are also found in apical areas of the mesenchyme;  knockdown of mmp- <dig> mrna expression impairs palate shelf fusion and results in significant medial edge epithelium remaining in contacted areas; and  bio-neutralization of tgf-β <dig> significantly decreases mmp- <dig> gene expression. these data suggest a functional role for mmp- <dig> in mouse sp development and are the first to identify a role for a single mmp in mouse sp development.
