BACKGROUND
curcumin is known to possess many anti-tumor properties such as inhibition of tumor growth and induction of apotosis. however, limited bioavailability of curcumin prevents its clinical application. a synthesized curcumin analog,  <dig> -diaryl-3-oxo- <dig> -pentadiene such as go-y <dig>  has the improved anti-tumor potential in vitro as well as in mouse model of colorectal carcinogenesis.


RESULTS
these compounds were divided into two groups; one is the higher anti-proliferative group, in which  <dig> % of  <dig> -diaryl-3-oxo- <dig> -pentadienes were clustered. one of the  <dig> -diaryl-3-oxo- <dig> -pentadiene analogs, go-y <dig> has the most enhanced growth inhibition, and its solubility was improved, compared with curcumin. go-y <dig> inhibits nf-Îºb transactivation, as well as expression of tp <dig> and dr <dig> more effectively than curcumin. in a mouse model, go-y <dig> presented  <dig>  fold more survival elongation that was not achieved by curcumin and go-y <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the  <dig> -diaryl-3-oxo- <dig> -pentadiene analogs can yield good lead compounds for cancer chemotherapy, to overcome low bioavailability of curcumin.
