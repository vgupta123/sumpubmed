BACKGROUND
long non-coding rnas  have been identified to play important roles in epigenetic processes that underpin organogenesis. however, the role of lncrnas in the regulation of transition from fetal to adult life of human heart has not been evaluated.

methods
immunofiuorescent staining was used to determine the extent of cardiac cell proliferation. human lncrna microarrays were applied to define gene expression signatures of the fetal  and adult hearts . pathway analysis was performed to predict the function of differentially expressed mrnas . dem related to cell proliferation were selected to construct a lncrna-mrna co-expression network. eight lncrnas were confirmed by quantificational real-time polymerase chain reaction .


RESULTS
cardiac cell proliferation was significant in the fetal heart. two thousand six hundred six lncrnas and  <dig> mrnas were found to be differentially expressed. cell cycle was the most enriched pathway in down-regulated genes in the adult heart. eight lncrnas  were predicted to play a central role in cardiac cell proliferation.


CONCLUSIONS
we discovered a profile of lncrnas differentially expressed between the human fetal and adult heart. several meaningful lncrnas involved in cardiac cell proliferation were disclosed.
