BACKGROUND
abnormalities in glycan biosynthesis have been conclusively related to various diseases, whereas the complexity of the glycosylation process has impeded the quantitative analysis of biochemical experimental data for the identification of glycoforms contributing to disease. to overcome this limitation, the automatic construction of glycosylation reaction networks in silico is a critical step.


RESULTS
in this paper, a framework k <dig> is developed to automatically construct n-glycosylation networks in matlab with the involvement of the  <dig> most-known enzyme reaction rules of  <dig> enzymes, as an extension of previous model kb <dig>  a toolbox named glycosylation network analysis toolbox  is applied to define network properties systematically, including linkages, stereochemical specificity and reaction conditions of enzymes. our network shows a strong ability to predict a wider range of glycans produced by the enzymes encountered in the golgi apparatus in human cell expression systems.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate a better understanding of the underlying glycosylation process and the potential of systems glycobiology tools for analyzing conventional biochemical or mass spectrometry-based experimental data quantitatively in a more realistic and practical way.
