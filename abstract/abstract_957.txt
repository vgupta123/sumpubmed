BACKGROUND
domain fusion is limited at enzyme one terminus. the issue was explored by swapping a mesophilic aspergillus niger gh <dig> xylanase  with a hyper-thermophilic thermotoga maritima glucanase  to construct two chimeras, xyn-glu and glu-xyn, with an intention to create thermostable xylanase containing glucanase activity.


RESULTS
when expressed in e. coli bl <dig>  the two chimeras exhibited bi-functional activities of xylanase and glucanase. the xyn-glu xyn moiety had optimal reaction temperature  at 50 °c and thermal in-activation half-life  at 50 °c for  <dig>  min, compared to 47 °c and  <dig>  min for the xyn. the glu-xyn xyn moiety had equivalent topt to and shorter t1/ <dig>  than the xyn. both chimera glu moieties were more thermostable than the glu, and the three enzyme topt values were higher than 96 °c. the glu-xyn glu moiety optimal ph was  <dig> , compared to  <dig>  for the xyn-glu glu moiety and the glu. both chimera two moieties cooperated with each other in degrading substrates.


CONCLUSIONS
domain-swapping created different effects on each moiety properties. fusing the glu domain at c-terminus increased the xylanase thermostability, but fusing the glu domain at n-terminus decreased the xylanase thermostability. fusing the xyn domain at either terminus increased the glucanase thermostability, and fusing the xyn domain at c-terminus shifted the glucanase ph property  <dig> units higher towards alkaline environments. fusing a domain at c-terminus contributes more to enzyme catalytic activity; whereas, fusing a bigger domain at n-terminus disturbs enzyme substrate binding affinity.
