BACKGROUND
pyrin-only protein  <dig>  is a small human protein comprised solely of a pyrin domain that inhibits nf-κb p65/rela and blocks the formation of functional il-1β processing inflammasomes. pyrin proteins are abundant in mammals and several, like pop <dig>  have been linked to activation or regulation of inflammatory processes. because pop <dig> knockout mice would help probe the biological role of inflammatory regulation, we thus considered whether pop <dig> is common in the mammalian lineage.


RESULTS
blast searches revealed that pop <dig> is absent from the available genomes of not only mice and rats, but those of other domestic mammals and new world monkeys as well. pop <dig> is however present in the genome of the primate species most closely related to humans including pan troglodytes , macaca mulatta  and others. interestingly, chimpanzee pop <dig> is identical to human pop <dig>  at both the dna and protein level. macaque pop <dig> , although highly conserved is not identical to the human sequence; however, both functions of the human protein are retained. further, pop <dig> appears to have arisen in the mammalian genome relatively recently  and likely derived from retrogene insertion of nlrp <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our findings support the hypothesis that the nlr loci of mammals, encoding proteins involved in innate and adaptive immunity as well as mammalian development, have been subject to recent and strong selective pressures. since pop <dig> is capable of regulating signaling events and processes linked to innate immunity and inflammation, its presence in the genomes of hominids and old world primates further suggests that additional regulation of these signals is important in these species.
