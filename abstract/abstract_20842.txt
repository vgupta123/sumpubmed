BACKGROUND
we previously determined that newborn piglets orally gavaged with ovalbumin  responded to systemic ova re-exposure with tolerance; if adjuvants were included in oral vaccine, piglets responded with antibody-mediated immunity :211– <dig>  2014). here, we will investigate whether newborn piglets gavaged with a vaccine comprised of ova plus unmethylated cpg oligodeoxynucleotides  combined with ova plus cpg encapsulated within polyphosphazene microparticles  responded with systemic and mucosal immunity. to monitor the response to systemic antigen re-exposure, piglets were i.p.-immunized with ova plus incomplete freund’s adjuvant  one month later.


RESULTS
newborn piglets  were gavaged with a combined soluble and particulate vaccine consisting of ova  plus  <dig> μg cpg and  <dig>  mg ova plus  <dig> μg cpg encapsulated within a polyphosphazene mp  referred to as ova/cpg + mp. control piglets were gavaged with saline alone. piglets were i.p. immunized with  <dig> mg ova  in ifa at four weeks of age and then euthanized at eight weeks of age. we observed significantly higher titres of serum anti-ova immunoglobulin  igm, iga, igg, igg <dig>  igg <dig> and igg in piglets immunized with  <dig>  mg ova/cpg + mp relative to saline control animals. thus, a single oral exposure at birth to a combined soluble and particulate ova vaccine including adjuvants can circumvent induction of oral tolerance which impacts response to i.p. vaccination in later life. further, piglets gavaged with  <dig>  mg ova/cpg + mp generated significant anti-ova igg and igg <dig> titres in lung compared to saline control piglets but results were comparable to titres measured in parenteral control piglets. peripheral blood mononuclear cells  ex vivo-stimulated with ova showed markedly decreased production of il- <dig> cytokine after  <dig> hours relative to animal-matched cells incubated with media alone. no production of ifn-γ was observed from any groups.


CONCLUSIONS
newborn piglets gavaged with low dose soluble and particulate ova plus cpg odn and polyphosphazene adjuvants produced antigen-specific antibodies in serum and lung after systemic re-exposure in later life. these data indicate circumvention of oral tolerance but not induction of oral immunity.
