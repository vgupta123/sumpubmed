BACKGROUND
genotype networks are representations of genetic variation data that are complementary to phylogenetic trees. a genotype network is a graph whose nodes are genotypes  with the same broadly defined phenotype. two nodes are connected if they differ in some minimal way, e.g., in a single nucleotide.


RESULTS
we analyze human genome variation data from the  <dig>  genomes project, and construct haploid genotype  networks for  <dig>  protein coding genes. the structure of these networks varies widely among genes, indicating different patterns of variation despite a shared evolutionary history. we focus on those genes whose genotype networks show many cycles, which can indicate homoplasy, i.e., parallel or convergent evolution, on the sequence level.


CONCLUSIONS
for  <dig> genes, the observed number of cycles is so large that it cannot be explained by either chance homoplasy or recombination. when analyzing possible explanations, we discovered evidence for positive selection in  <dig> of these genes and, in addition, a potential role for constrained variation and purifying selection. balancing selection plays at most a small role. the  <dig> genes with excess cycles are enriched in functions related to immunity and response to pathogens. genotype networks are representations of genetic variation data that can help understand unusual patterns of genomic variation.
