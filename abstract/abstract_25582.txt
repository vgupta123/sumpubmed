BACKGROUND
ciclesonide is a novel inhaled corticosteroid for the treatment of airway inflammation. in this study we investigated uptake and in vitro metabolism of ciclesonide in human alveolar type ii epithelial cells . ciclesonide uptake was compared with fluticasone propionate, an inhaled corticosteroid that is not metabolized in lung tissue. a <dig> cells were incubated with  <dig> × 10- <dig> m ciclesonide or fluticasone propionate for  <dig> to  <dig> min to determine uptake; or with  <dig> × 10- <dig> m ciclesonide for  <dig> h, followed by incubation with drug-free buffer for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h to analyze in vitro metabolism. high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure the concentrations of both corticosteroids and metabolites.


RESULTS
at all time points the mean intracellular concentration was higher for ciclesonide when compared with fluticasone propionate. activation of ciclesonide to desisobutyryl-ciclesonide  was confirmed and conjugates of des-cic with fatty acids were detected. the intracellular concentration of ciclesonide decreased over time, whereas the concentration of des-cic remained relatively stable:  <dig>  to  <dig>  pmol/dish between  <dig> and  <dig> h. the concentration of des-cic fatty acid conjugates increased over time, with des-cic-oleate being the main metabolite.


CONCLUSIONS
uptake of ciclesonide into a <dig> cells was more efficient than that of the less lipophilic fluticasone propionate. intracellular concentrations of the pharmacologically active metabolite des-cic were maintained for up to  <dig> h. the local anti-inflammatory activity of ciclesonide in the lung may be prolonged by the slow release of active drug from the depot of fatty acid esters.
