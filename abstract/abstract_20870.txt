BACKGROUND
the viridiplantae  consist of two monophyletic lineages, the chlorophyta and the streptophyta. the streptophyta include all embryophytes and a small but diverse group of freshwater algae traditionally known as the charophyceae . the only flagellate currently included in the streptophyta is mesostigma viride lauterborn. to gain insight into the genome evolution in streptophytes, we have sequenced  <dig>  ests from mesostigma representing  <dig>  independent contigs and compared the ests of mesostigma with available plant genomes , with ests from the bryophyte physcomitrella, the genome of the rhodophyte cyanidioschyzon, the ests from the rhodophyte porphyra, and the genome of the diatom thalassiosira.


RESULTS
the number of expressed genes shared by mesostigma with the embryophytes  is higher than with chlamydomonas . in general, cytosolic metabolic pathways, and proteins involved in vesicular transport, transcription, regulation, dna-structure and replication, cell cycle control, and rna-metabolism are more conserved between mesostigma and the embryophytes than between mesostigma and chlamydomonas. however, plastidic and mitochondrial metabolic pathways, cytoskeletal proteins and proteins involved in protein folding are more conserved between mesostigma and chlamydomonas than between mesostigma and the embryophytes.


CONCLUSIONS
our est-analysis of mesostigma supports the notion that this organism should be a suitable unicellular model for the last flagellate common ancestor of the streptophytes. mesostigma shares more genes with the embryophytes than with the chlorophyte chlamydomonas reinhardtii, although both organisms are flagellate unicells. thus, it seems likely that several major physiological changes  took place early during the evolution of streptophytes, i.e. before the transition to land.
