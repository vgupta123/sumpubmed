BACKGROUND
sulfotransferases are a large group of enzymes that regulate the biological activity or availability of a wide spectrum of substrates through sulfation with the sulfur donor 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate . these enzymes are known to be difficult to assay. a convenient assay is needed in order to better understand these enzymes.


RESULTS
a universal sulfotransferase assay method based on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  is described. this assay has been successfully applied to substrates as small as α-naphthol and as big as proteoglycans. as examples, we present the assays for recombinant human chst <dig>  tpst <dig>  chst <dig> and hs6st <dig>  in order to assess whether a small molecule can be applicable to this type of assay, a method to estimate the relative mobility of a molecule to paps is also presented. the estimated relative mobilities of various sulfated small molecules generated by sult1a <dig>  sult1e <dig>  sult2a <dig> and chst <dig> are in the range of ±  <dig>  of the actual relative mobilities.


CONCLUSIONS
the versatility of the current method comes from the ability that sds-page can separate proteins and small molecules according to different parameters. while mobilities of proteins during sds-page are inversely related to their sizes, mobilities of small molecules are positively related to their charge/mass ratios. the predicted relative mobility of a product to paps is a good indicator of whether a sulfotransferase can be assayed with sds-page. because phosphorylation is most similar to sulfation in chemistry, the method is likely to be applicable to kinases as well.
