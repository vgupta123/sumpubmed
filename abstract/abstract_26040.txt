BACKGROUND
nur <dig> is an orphan nuclear receptor expressed in human atheroma. in vascular cells in vitro, nur <dig> expression is induced by pro-inflammatory factors, such as oxidized ldl .

methods
we analyze the role of nur <dig> in the oxldl-induced differentiation of macrophages into dendritic cells . the murine raw <dig>  macrophage cell line was stably transfected with expression plasmids encoding either gfp or gfp fusions with either full-length nur <dig> , nur <dig> lacking the dna binding domain  or nur <dig> lacking the transactivation domain .


RESULTS
gfp-nur <dig> overexpression significantly suppressed the effect of oxldl treatment on dc morphologic changes, expression of dc maturation markers, endocytic activity, allogeneic activation of t cell proliferation, and the activity and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. analysis of gfp-nur77-Δtad and gfp-nur77-Δdbd indicated that the nur <dig> dna binding and transactivation domains were both required for this effect. gfp-nur77-Δdbd consistently had the opposite effect to gfp-nur <dig>  increasing dc-type differentiation in all assays. interestingly, gfp-nur77-Δdbd protein was cytosolic, whereas gfp-nur <dig> and gfp-nur77-Δtad were both nuclear.


CONCLUSIONS
these data show that gfp-nur <dig> inhibited differentiation of oxldl-treated macrophages into dc. the effects of nur <dig> on the macrophage phenotype may involve changes in its subcellular distribution.
