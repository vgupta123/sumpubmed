BACKGROUND
gsl <dig> and gsl <dig>  gibberellin stimulated-like proteins , are cysteine-rich peptides from potato  with antimicrobial properties. similar peptides in other species have been implicated in diverse biological processes and are hypothesised to play a role in several aspects of plant development, plant responses to biotic or abiotic stress through their participation in hormone crosstalk, and redox homeostasis. to help resolve the biological roles of gsl <dig> and gsl <dig> peptides we have undertaken an in depth analysis of the structure and expression of these genes in potato.


RESULTS
we have characterised the full length genes for both gsl <dig>  and gsl <dig>  from diploid and tetraploid potato using the reference genome sequence of potato, coupled with further next generation sequencing of four highly heterozygous tetraploid cultivars. the frequency of snps in gsl <dig> and gsl <dig> were very low with only one snp every  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides in exon regions of gsl <dig> and gsl <dig>  respectively. analysis of comprehensive rna-seq data substantiated the role of specific promoter motifs in transcriptional control of gene expression. expression analysis based on the frequency of next generation sequence reads established that gsl <dig> was expressed at a higher level than gsl <dig> in  <dig> out of  <dig> tissue and treatment libraries. furthermore, both the gsl <dig> and gsl <dig> genes exhibited constitutive expression that was not up regulated in response to biotic or abiotic stresses, hormone treatments or wounding. potato transformation with antisense knock-down expression cassettes failed to recover viable plants.


CONCLUSIONS
the potato gsl <dig> and gsl <dig> genes are very highly conserved suggesting they contribute to an important biological function. the known antimicrobial activity of the gsl proteins, coupled with the fpkm analysis from rna-seq data, implies that both genes contribute to the constitutive defence barriers in potatoes. the lethality of antisense knock-down expression of gsl <dig> and gsl <dig>  coupled with the rare incidence of snps in these genes, suggests an essential role for this gene family. these features are consistent with the gsl protein family playing a role in several aspects of plant development in addition to plant defence against biotic stresses.
