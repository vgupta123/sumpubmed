BACKGROUND
the arabidopsis atmyb <dig> transcription factor regulates genes involved in pollen development and controls the timing of tapetal programmed cell death . downregulation of atmyb <dig> expression precedes tapetal degradation. inhibition of atmyb <dig> expression results in complete male sterility. full-length atmyb <dig> homologs have been isolated in wheat, rice, barley and canola .


RESULTS
the complete sequences of myb <dig> genes from the brassica. napus , b. juncea , b. oleracea  and the two orthologs from cotton  were determined. the deduced amino acid sequences possess a highly conserved myb domain, 44-amino acid region and 18-amino acid c-terminal sequence. the cotton myb <dig> protein can fully restore fertility of the atmyb <dig> mutant, while removal of the  <dig> amino acid sequence abolishes its function. two conserved myb cis-elements in the atmyb <dig> promoter are required for downregulation of myb <dig> expression in anthers, apparently via negative auto-regulation. in cotton, tapetal degradation occurs at a slightly earlier stage of anther development than in arabidopsis, consistent with an earlier increase and subsequent downregulation in ghmyb <dig> expression. the myb <dig> homologs fused with the ear repressor motif have been shown to induce male sterility in arabidopsis. constructs were designed to maximize the level of male sterility.


CONCLUSIONS
myb <dig> genes are conserved in structure and function in all monocot and dicot species so far examined. expression patterns of myb <dig> in these species are also highly similar. the reversible male sterility system developed in arabidopsis by manipulating myb <dig> expression should be applicable to all major crops.
