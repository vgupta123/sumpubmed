BACKGROUND
in this report we have explored the genomic and microbiological basis for a sustained increase in bloodstream infections at a major australian hospital caused by enterococcus faecium multi-locus sequence type   <dig>  an outbreak strain that has largely replaced a predecessor st <dig> sequence type.


RESULTS
to establish a st <dig> reference sequence we fully assembled and annotated the genome of aus <dig>  a  <dig> vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium  bloodstream isolate, and the first example of a completed st <dig> genome. aus <dig> has a  <dig>  mb genome, comprising a  <dig>  mb circular chromosome and six circular plasmids . twelve percent of the  <dig> coding sequences  in aus <dig> are not present in st <dig> e. faecium aus <dig> and st <dig> e. faecium tx <dig>  extending this comparison to an additional  <dig> st <dig> and  <dig> st <dig> e. faecium hospital isolate genomes revealed only six genomic regions spanning  <dig> kb that were present in all st <dig> and absent from all st <dig> genomes. the  <dig> cds have predicted functions that include ion transport, riboflavin metabolism and two phosphotransferase systems. comparison of the vancomycin resistance-conferring tn <dig> transposon between aus <dig> and aus <dig> revealed differences in transposon length and insertion site, and van locus sequence variation that correlated with a higher vancomycin mic in aus <dig>  additional phenotype comparisons between st <dig> and st <dig> isolates showed that while there were no differences in biofilm-formation and killing of galleria mellonella, st <dig> isolates grew significantly faster and out-competed st <dig> isolates in growth assays.


CONCLUSIONS
here we have fully assembled and annotated the first st <dig> genome, and then characterized the genomic differences between st <dig> and st <dig> e. faecium. we also show that st <dig> e. faecium are faster growing and can out-compete st <dig> e. faecium. while a causal genetic basis for these phenotype differences is not provided here, this study revealed conserved genetic differences between the two clones, differences that can now be tested to explain the molecular basis for the success and emergence of st <dig> e. faecium.
