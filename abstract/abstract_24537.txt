BACKGROUND
the icos-b7h costimulatory receptor-ligand pair is required for germinal center formation, the production of isotype-switched antibodies, and antibody affinity maturation in response to t cell-dependent antigens. however, the potentially distinct roles of regulated b7h expression on b cells and dendritic cells in t cell-dependent antibody responses have not been defined.


RESULTS
we generated transgenic mice with lineage-restricted b7h expression to assess the cell-type specific roles of b7h expression on b cells and dendritic cells in regulating t cell-dependent antibody responses. our results show that endogenous b7h expression is reduced on b cells after activation in vitro and is also reduced in vivo on antibody-secreting plasma b cells in comparison to both na√Øve and germinal center b cells from which they are derived. increasing the level of b7h expression on activated and plasma b cells in b-b7htg mice led to an increase in the number of antibody-secreting plasma cells generated after immunization and a corresponding increase in the concentration of antigen-specific high affinity serum igg antibodies of all isotypes, without affecting the number of responding germinal center b cells. in contrast, icos costimulation mediated by dendritic cells in dc-b7htg mice contributed to germinal center formation and selectively increased igg2a production without affecting the overall magnitude of antibody responses.


CONCLUSIONS
using transgenic mice with lineage-restricted b7h expression, we have revealed distinct roles of icos costimulation mediated by dendritic cells and b cells in the regulation of t cell-dependent antibody responses.
