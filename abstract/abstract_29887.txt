BACKGROUND
the large and complex hexaploid genome has greatly hindered genomics studies of common wheat . here, we investigated transcripts in common wheat developing caryopses using the emerging single-molecule real-time  sequencing technology pacbio rsii, and assessed the resultant data for improving common wheat genome annotation and grain transcriptome research.


RESULTS
we obtained  <dig>  full-length non-chimeric  reads,  <dig>  % of which were estimated to carry complete open reading frame. a total of  <dig>  high-quality flnc reads were identified and mapped to  <dig>  chromosomal loci, corresponding to  <dig>  known genes and  <dig> new genes not annotated previously. although some flnc reads could not be unambiguously mapped to the current draft genome sequence, many of them are likely useful for studying highly similar homoeologous or paralogous loci or for improving chromosomal contig assembly in further research. the  <dig>  high-quality flnc reads represented  <dig>  unique transcripts,  <dig> of which were newly discovered. we found  <dig> transcripts each spanning two or three previously annotated adjacent loci, suggesting that they should be merged to form correct gene models. finally, our data facilitated the identification of  <dig> genes differentially regulated during caryopsis development, and full-length transcripts for  <dig> transcribed gluten gene members that are important for the end-use quality control of common wheat.


CONCLUSIONS
our work demonstrated the value of pacbio transcript sequencing for improving common wheat genome annotation through uncovering the loci and full-length transcripts not discovered previously. the resource obtained may aid further structural genomics and grain transcriptome studies of common wheat.
