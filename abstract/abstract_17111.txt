BACKGROUND
one of the key genes that regulate human brain size, mcph <dig> has evolved under strong darwinian positive selection during the evolution of primates. during this evolution, the divergence of mcph <dig> protein sequences among primates may have caused functional changes that contribute to brain enlargement.


RESULTS
to test this hypothesis, we used co-immunoprecipitation and reporter gene assays to examine the activating and repressing effects of mcph <dig> on a set of its down-stream genes and then compared the functional outcomes of a series of mutant mcph <dig> proteins that carry mutations at the human- and great-ape-specific sites. the results demonstrate that the regulatory effects of human mcph <dig> and rhesus macaque mcph <dig> are different in three of eight down-stream genes tested , suggesting a functional divergence of mcph <dig> between human and non-human primates. further analyses of the mutant mcph <dig> proteins indicated that most of the human-specific mutations could change the regulatory effects on the down-stream genes. a similar result was also observed for one of the four great-ape-specific mutations.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, we propose that during primate evolution in general and human evolution in particular, the divergence of mcph <dig> protein sequences under darwinian positive selection led to functional modifications, providing a possible molecular mechanism of how mcph <dig> contributed to brain enlargement during primate evolution and human origin.
