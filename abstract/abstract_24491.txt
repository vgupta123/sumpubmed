BACKGROUND
mouse limb bud is a prime model to study the regulatory interactions that control vertebrate organogenesis. major aspects of limb bud development are controlled by feedback loops that define a self-regulatory signalling system. the shh/grem1/aer-fgf feedback loop forms the core of this signalling system that operates between the posterior mesenchymal organiser and the ectodermal signalling centre. the bmp antagonist gremlin <dig>  is a critical node in this system, whose dynamic expression is controlled by bmp, shh, and fgf signalling and key to normal progression of limb bud development. previous analysis identified a distant cis-regulatory landscape within the neighbouring formin <dig>  locus that is required for grem <dig> expression, reminiscent of the genomic landscapes controlling hoxd and shh expression in limb buds.


RESULTS
three highly conserved regions  were identified within the previously defined critical genomic region and tested for their ability to regulate grem <dig> expression in mouse limb buds. using a combination of bac and conventional transgenic approaches, a 9 kb region located ~70 kb downstream of the grem <dig> transcription unit was identified. this region, termed grem <dig> regulatory sequence  <dig> , is able to recapitulate major aspects of grem <dig> expression, as it drives expression of a lacz reporter into the posterior and, to a lesser extent, in the distal-anterior mesenchyme. crossing the grs <dig> transgene into embryos with alterations in the shh and bmp pathways established that grs <dig> depends on shh and is modulated by bmp signalling, i.e. integrates inputs from these pathways. chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed interaction of endogenous gli <dig> proteins with the core cis-regulatory elements in the grs <dig> region. as gli <dig> is a mediator of shh signal transduction, these results indicated that shh directly controls grem <dig> expression through the grs <dig> region. finally, all cis-regulatory regions within the grem <dig> genomic landscape locate to the dnase i hypersensitive sites identified in this genomic region by the encode consortium.


CONCLUSIONS
this study establishes that distant cis-regulatory regions scattered through a larger genomic landscape control the highly dynamic expression of grem <dig>  which is key to normal progression of mouse limb bud development.
