BACKGROUND
pigeonpea  millsp) is one of the major grain legume crops of the tropics and subtropics, but biotic stresses  are serious challenges for sustainable crop production. modern genomic tools such as molecular markers and candidate genes associated with resistance to these stresses offer the possibility of facilitating pigeonpea breeding for improving biotic stress resistance. availability of limited genomic resources, however, is a serious bottleneck to undertake molecular breeding in pigeonpea to develop superior genotypes with enhanced resistance to above mentioned biotic stresses. with an objective of enhancing genomic resources in pigeonpea, this study reports generation and analysis of comprehensive resource of fw- and smd- responsive expressed sequence tags .


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> cdna libraries were constructed from four pigeonpea genotypes that are resistant and susceptible to fw  and smd  and a total of  <dig>   ests were generated and deposited in dbest of genbank under accession numbers gr <dig> to gr <dig> and gr <dig> to gr <dig>  clustering and assembly analyses of these ests resulted into  <dig>  unique sequences  including  <dig> contigs and  <dig>  singletons. blastn analysis of  <dig>  unigenes showed a significant identity with ests of different legumes , rice , arabidopsis  and poplar . as expected, pigeonpea ests are more closely related to soybean  and cowpea ests  than other plant ests. similarly, blastx similarity results showed that only  <dig>   out of  <dig>  total unigenes correspond to known proteins in the uniprot database . functional categorization of the annotated unigenes sequences showed that  <dig>  genes were assigned to cellular component category,  <dig>  to biological process, and  <dig>  in molecular function. further,  <dig> genes were identified differentially expressed between fw- responsive genotypes and  <dig> between smd- responsive genotypes. generated ests were compiled together with  <dig> ests available in public domain, at the time of analysis, and a set of  <dig>  unigenes were defined that were used for identification of molecular markers in pigeonpea. for instance,  <dig>  simple sequence repeat  motifs were identified in  <dig>  unigenes and  <dig> primer pairs were designed. assessment of a set of  <dig> primer pairs on  <dig> elite pigeonpea lines showed polymorphism with  <dig>  markers with an average of four alleles per marker and an average polymorphic information content  value of  <dig> . similarly, in silico mining of  <dig> contigs with â‰¥  <dig> sequences detected  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  in  <dig> contigs. as an example, a set of  <dig> contigs were used for confirming in silico predicted snps in a set of four genotypes using wet lab experiments. occurrence of snps were confirmed for all the  <dig> contigs for which scorable and sequenceable amplicons were generated. pcr amplicons were not obtained in case of  <dig> contigs. recognition sites for restriction enzymes were identified for  <dig> snps in  <dig> contigs that indicates possibility of assaying snps in  <dig> genes using cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences  assay.


CONCLUSIONS
the pigeonpea est dataset generated here provides a transcriptomic resource for gene discovery and development of functional markers associated with biotic stress resistance. sequence analyses of this dataset have showed conservation of a considerable number of pigeonpea transcripts across legume and model plant species analysed as well as some putative pigeonpea specific genes. validation of identified biotic stress responsive genes should provide candidate genes for allele mining as well as candidate markers for molecular breeding.
