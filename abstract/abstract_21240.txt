BACKGROUND
study of erk activation has thus far relied on biochemical assays that are limited to the use of phospho-specific antibodies and radioactivity in vitro, and analysis of whole cell populations in vivo. as with many systems, fluorescence resonance energy transfer  can be utilized to make highly sensitive detectors of molecular activity. here we introduce fret-based erk activity sensors, which utilize variants of enhanced green fluorescent protein fused by an erk-specific peptide linker to detect erk <dig> activity.


RESULTS
erk activity sensors display varying changes in fret upon phosphorylation by active erk <dig> in vitro depending on the composition of erk-specific peptide linker sequences derived from known in vivo erk targets, ets <dig> and elk <dig>  analysis of point mutations reveals specific residues involved in erk binding and phosphorylation of erk activity sensor  <dig>  erk <dig> also shows high in vitro specificity for these sensors over two other major map kinases, p <dig> and psapk/jnk.


CONCLUSIONS
eas's are a convenient, non-radioactive alternative to study erk dynamics in vitro. they can be utilized to study erk activity in real-time. this new technology can be applied to studying erk kinetics in vitro, analysis of erk activity in whole cell extracts, and high-throughput screening technologies.
