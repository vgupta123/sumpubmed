BACKGROUND
while the genetic transformation of the major cereal crops has become relatively routine, to date only a few reports were published on transgenic triticale, and robust data on t-dna integration and segregation have not been available in this species.


RESULTS
here, we present a comprehensive analysis of stable transgenic winter triticale cv. bogo carrying the selectable marker gene hygromycin phosphotransferase  and a synthetic green fluorescent protein gene . progeny of four independent transgenic plants were comprehensively investigated with regard to the number of integrated t-dna copies, the number of plant genomic integration loci, the integrity and functionality of individual t-dna copies, as well as the segregation of transgenes in t <dig> and t <dig> generations, which also enabled us to identify homozygous transgenic lines. the truncation of some integrated t-dnas at their left end along with the occurrence of independent segregation of multiple t-dnas unintendedly resulted in a single-copy segregant that is selectable marker-free and homozygous for the gfp gene. the heritable expression of gfp driven by the maize ubi- <dig> promoter was demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy.


CONCLUSIONS
the used transformation method is a valuable tool for the genetic engineering of triticale. here we show that comprehensive molecular analyses are required for the correct interpretation of phenotypic data collected from the transgenic plants.
