BACKGROUND
the reduced drug accumulation based on enhanced drug efflux and metabolic capacity, identified in triclabendazole -resistant fasciola hepatica may contribute to the development of resistance to tcbz. the aim of this work was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy of tcbz administered alone or co-administered with ivermectin  and methimazole  in tcbz-resistant f. hepatica-parasitized sheep. sheep infected with tcbz-resistant f. hepatica  were divided into three groups : untreated control, tcbz-treated  and tcbz+ivm+mtz treated sheep . plasma samples were collected and analysed by hplc. in the clinical efficacy study, the animals were sacrificed at  <dig> days post-treatment to evaluate the comparative efficacy against tcbz-resistant f. hepatica.


RESULTS
the presence of ivm and mtz did not affect the plasma disposition kinetics of tcbz metabolites after the i.r. administration of tcbz. the auc value of tcbz.so obtained after tcbz administration  was similar to that obtained after tcbz co-administered with ivm and mtz . efficacy values of  <dig> and 38% were observed for tcbz alone and for the combined treatment, respectively. no statistical differences  were observed in fluke counts between treated groups and untreated control, which confirm the resistant status of the sligo isolate.


CONCLUSIONS
the presence of ivm and mtz did not affect the disposition kinetics of tcbz and its metabolites. thus, the combined drug treatment did not reverse the poor efficacy of tcbz against tcbz-resistant f. hepatica.
