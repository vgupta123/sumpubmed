BACKGROUND
s. cerevisiae yps <dig> is the prototypical aspartic endopeptidase of the fungal yapsin family. this glycosylphosphatidylinositol  anchored enzyme was recently shown to be involved in the shedding of the gpi proteins utr <dig>  gas <dig> and itself. it was also proposed to be part of a novel quality control mechanism that eliminates excess and/or misfolded gpi proteins. what regulates its shedding activity at the cell surface is however poorly understood. yps <dig> is initially synthesized as a zymogen requiring proteolytic activation to remove a pro-peptide and further processing within a large insertion loop  generates a two-subunit endopeptidase. to investigate the role of this loop on its shedding activity, which typically takes place within ser/thr-rich domains, it was replaced with the short peptide found at the analogous position in yps <dig>  we also tested whether o-glycosylation might protect against proteolytic processing by yps <dig> 


RESULTS
we show here that replacement of the n-entrance loop  of yps <dig> generates a single chain endopeptidase that undergoes partial  or complete  pro-peptide removal. at both ph, the shedding activity of the chimeric endopeptidase  toward gas <dig> and itself is strongly and drastically increased, respectively. a direct correlation between endoproteolytic cleavage of this loop in native yps <dig> and its shedding is observed. the yps1-dependent shedding of two model gpi proteins  is also stimulated by the absence of the o-mannosyltransferases, pmt <dig> and pmt <dig> respectively, involved in o-glycosylation of their ser/thr-rich domains. under these conditions, some yps1-independent shedding is also observed.


CONCLUSIONS
partial pro-peptide removal is essential to produce a functional yps <dig> endopeptidase. the yps <dig> n-ent loop plays a major role in regulating the shedding activity of the endopeptidase, most likely by limiting access to the active site, and its cleavage in native yps <dig> is associated with its shedding. o-glycosylation protects against yps1-dependent and -independent shedding of gpi proteins. it is postulated that hypoglycosylation of cell surface proteins, which may occur for misfolded proteins that escaped the er-associated degradation, might target their elimination through shedding by yps <dig> and possibly other yapsin members.
