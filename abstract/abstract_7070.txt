BACKGROUND
overlapping transcription constitutes a common mechanism for regulating gene expression. a major limitation of the overlapping transcription assays is the lack of high throughput expression data.


RESULTS
we developed a new tool  that is based on reads distributions along the transcribed regions to identify the expression levels of overlapping genes from standard rna-seq data. compared with five commonly used quantification methods, iaoseq showed better performance in the estimation accuracy of overlapping transcription levels. for the same strand overlapping transcription, currently existing high-throughput methods are rarely available to distinguish which strand was present in the original mrna template. the iaoseq results showed that the commonly used methods gave an average of  <dig>  fold overestimation of the expression levels of same strand overlapping genes.


CONCLUSIONS
this work provides a useful tool for mining overlapping transcription levels from standard rna-seq libraries. iaoseq could be used to help us understand the complex regulatory mechanism mediated by overlapping transcripts. iaoseq is freely available at http://lifecenter.sgst.cn/main/en/iao_seq.jsp.
