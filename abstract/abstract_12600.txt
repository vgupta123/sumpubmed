BACKGROUND
the objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of two commercial feed supplements, egusin 250®  and egusin slh® , on gastric ulcer scores, gastric fluid ph, and blood gas values in stall-confined horses undergoing feed-deprivation.

methods
nine thoroughbred horses were used in a three-period crossover study. for the three treatment groups, sweet feed was mixed with e- <dig>  e-slh, or nothing  and fed twice daily. horses were treated for  <dig> days, then an additional  <dig> days while on an alternating feed-deprivation model to induce or worsen ulcers . in periods two and three, horses  were treated for an additional  <dig> days after feed-deprivation. gastroscopies were performed on day - <dig> , day  <dig> , day  <dig>  and day  <dig> . gastric juice ph was measured and gastric ulcer scores were assigned. venous blood gas values were also measured.


RESULTS
gastric ulcers in control horses significantly decreased after  <dig> days, but there was no difference in ulcer scores when compared to the egusin® treated horses. ng gastric ulcer scores significantly increased in e- <dig> and control horses on day  <dig> compared to day  <dig> as a result of intermittent feed-deprivation, but no treatment effect was observed. ng ulcer scores remained high in the control group but significantly decreased in the e-slh- and e-250-treated horses by day  <dig>  gastric juice ph values were low and variable and no treatment effect was observed. mean blood pco <dig> values were significantly increased two hours after feeding in treated horses compared to controls, whereas mean blood tco <dig> values increased in the  <dig> hour sample, but did not exceed  <dig> mmol/l.


CONCLUSIONS
the feed-deprivation model increased ng gastric ulcer severity in the horses. however, by day  <dig>  egusin® treated horses had less severe ng gastric ulcers compared to untreated control horses. after  <dig> days, egusin® products tested here ameliorate the severity of gastric ulcers in stall-confined horses after feed stress.
