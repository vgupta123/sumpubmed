BACKGROUND
the motor-driven predictions about expected sensory feedback  have been proposed to play an important role in recognition of sensory consequences of self-produced motor actions. in the auditory system, this effect was suggested to result in suppression of sensory neural responses to self-produced voices that are predicted by the efference copies during vocal production in comparison with passive listening to the playback of the identical self-vocalizations. in the present study, event-related potentials  were recorded in response to upward pitch shift stimuli  with five different magnitudes  at voice onset during active vocal production and passive listening to the playback.


RESULTS
results indicated that the suppression of the n <dig> component during vocal production was largest for unaltered voice feedback , became smaller as the magnitude of pss increased to  <dig> cents, and was almost completely eliminated in response to  <dig> cents stimuli.


CONCLUSIONS
findings of the present study suggest that the brain utilizes the motor predictions  to determine the source of incoming stimuli and maximally suppresses the auditory responses to unaltered feedback of self-vocalizations. the reduction of suppression for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cents and its elimination for  <dig> cents pitch-shifted voice auditory feedback support the idea that motor-driven suppression of voice feedback leads to distinctly different sensory neural processing of self vs. non-self vocalizations. this characteristic may enable the audio-vocal system to more effectively detect and correct for unexpected errors in the feedback of self-produced voice pitch compared with externally-generated sounds.
