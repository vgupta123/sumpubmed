BACKGROUND
long non-coding rnas  constitute a novel class of non-coding rnas. lncrnas regulate gene expression, thus having the possibility to modulate disease progression. in this study, we investigated the changes of lncrnas expression in the heart after myocardial infarction .


RESULTS
adult male c57/bl <dig> mice were subjected to coronary ligation or sham operation. in a derivation group of  <dig> mi and  <dig> sham-operated mice sacrificed 24 hours after surgery, microarray analysis showed that mi was associated with up-regulation of  <dig> lncrnas and down-regulation of  <dig> lncrnas . among these,  <dig> lncrnas, called myocardial infarction-associated transcript  <dig>  and  <dig> , showed robust up-regulation in the mi group: 5-fold and 13-fold, respectively. up-regulation of these  <dig> lncrnas after mi was confirmed by quantitative pcr in an independent validation group of  <dig> mi and  <dig> sham-operated mice . in a time-course analysis involving  <dig> additional mi mice, the expression of both lncrnas peaked 24 hours after mi and returned to baseline after 2 days. in situ hybridization revealed an up-regulation of mirt <dig> expression in the left ventricle of mi mice. expression of mirt <dig> and mirt <dig> correlated with the expression of multiple genes known to be involved in left ventricular remodeling. mice with high level of expression of mirt <dig> and mirt <dig> had a preserved ejection fraction.


CONCLUSIONS
myocardial infarction induces important changes in the expression of lncrnas in the heart. this study motivates further investigation of the role of lncrnas in left ventricular remodeling.
