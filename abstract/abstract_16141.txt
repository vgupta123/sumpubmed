BACKGROUND
medicinal plants harboring endophytic fungi could carry significant potential for producing bioactive secondary metabolites. endophytic fungi serve as alternate source of interesting compounds in their natural and modified synthetic forms to treat different diseases. in this regard, endophytic microflora associated with alkaloid-rich medicinal plants rhazya stricta is least known.


RESULTS
we isolated one new bioactive compound sorokiniol  along with two known cyclic peptides bzr-cotoxin i  and bzr-cotoxin iv  from fungal endophyte bipolaris sorokiniana lk <dig>  the structures of the isolated new and known compounds were elucidated through spectroscopic data, including 1d and 2d nmr , mass, and uv. the known peptides  were characterized by esi-ms, ms/ms, and by comparing the nmr data with the literature. the isolated metabolites were assayed for their role against enzyme inhibition. compound  <dig> was significantly inhibitory towards acetyl cholinestrase while the other compounds  had moderate anti-lipid peroxidation and urease activities.


CONCLUSIONS
the present results suggest that the endophytic microorganism associated with indigenously important medicinal plants can offer a rich source of biologically active chemical constituents which could help in discovering enzyme inhibitory lead drugs.
