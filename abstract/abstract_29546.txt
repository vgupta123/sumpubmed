BACKGROUND
the arabidopsis skp1-like <dig>  protein functions as a subunit of skp1-cul1-f-box  e <dig> ubiquitin ligases. previous genetic studies showed that ask <dig> plays important roles in arabidopsis flower development and male meiosis. however, the molecular impact of ask1-containing scf e <dig> ubiquitin ligases  on the floral proteome and transcriptome is unknown.


RESULTS
here we identified proteins that are potentially regulated by ask1-e3s by comparing floral bud proteomes of wild-type and the ask <dig> mutant plants. more than  <dig> proteins were detected in the ask <dig> mutant but not in wild-type and > <dig> were detected at higher levels in the ask <dig> mutant than in wild-type, but their rna levels were not significantly different between wild-type and ask <dig> floral buds as shown by transcriptomics analysis, suggesting that they are likely regulated at the protein level by ask1-e3s. integrated analyses of floral proteomics and transcriptomics of ask <dig> and wild-type uncovered several potential aspects of ask1-e <dig> functions, including regulation of transcription regulators, kinases, peptidases, and ribosomal proteins, with implications on possible mechanisms of ask1-e <dig> functions in floral development.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggested that ask1-e3s play important roles in arabidopsis protein degradation during flower development. this study opens up new possibilities for further functional studies of these candidate e <dig> substrates.
