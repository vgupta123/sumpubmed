BACKGROUND
sporisorium scitamineum causes the sugarcane smut disease, one of the most serious constraints to global sugarcane production. s. scitamineum possesses a sexual mating system composed of two mating-type loci, a and b locus. we previously identified and deleted the b locus in s. scitamineum, and found that the resultant ssΔmat-1b mutant was defective in mating and pathogenicity.


RESULTS
to further understand the function of b-mating locus, we carried out transcriptome analysis by comparing the transcripts of the mutant strain ssΔmat-1b, from which the ssbe <dig> and ssbw <dig> homeodomain transcription factors have previously been deleted, with those from the wild-type mat- <dig> strain. also the transcripts from ssΔmat-1b x mat- <dig> were compared with those from wild-type mat- <dig> x mat- <dig> mating. a total of  <dig> genes were up-regulated  in the ssΔmat-1b mutant, compared to the wild-type mat- <dig> strain, while  <dig> genes down-regulated . in the mixture,  <dig> genes were up-regulated  in ssΔmat-1b x mat- <dig>  which failed to mate, compared to the wild-type mat- <dig> x mat- <dig> mating, and  <dig> genes down-regulated . by comparing the up- and down-regulated genes in these two sets, it was found that  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes were common in non-mating haploid and mating mixture, which indeed could be genes regulated by b-locus. furthermore, go and kegg enrichment analysis suggested that carbon metabolism pathway and stress response mediated by hog <dig> mapk signaling pathway were altered in the non-mating sets.


CONCLUSIONS
experimental validation results indicate that the be/bw heterodimeric transcriptional factor, encoded by the b-locus, could regulate s. scitamineum sexual mating and/or filamentous growth via modulating glucose metabolism and hog1-mediating oxidative response.
