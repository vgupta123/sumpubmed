BACKGROUND
lipoproteins are virulence factors of mycobacterium tuberculosis. bacterial lipoproteins are modified by the consecutive action of preprolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase , prolipoprotein signal peptidase  and apolipoprotein n- acyltransferase  leading to the formation of mature triacylated lipoproteins. lnt homologues are found in gram-negative and high gc-rich gram-positive, but not in low gc-rich gram-positive bacteria, although n-acylation is observed. in fast-growing mycobacterium smegmatis, the molecular structure of the lipid modification of lipoproteins was resolved recently as a diacylglyceryl residue carrying ester-bound palmitic acid and ester-bound tuberculostearic acid and an additional amide-bound palmitic acid.


RESULTS
we exploit the vaccine strain mycobacterium bovis bcg as model organism to investigate lipoprotein modifications in slow-growing mycobacteria. using escherichia coli lnt as a query in blastp search, we identified bcg_2070c and bcg_2279c as putative lnt genes in m. bovis bcg. lipoproteins lprf, lpqh, lpql and lppx were expressed in m. bovis bcg and bcg_2070c lnt knock-out mutant and lipid modifications were analyzed at molecular level by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight analysis. lipoprotein n-acylation was observed in wildtype but not in bcg_2070c mutants. lipoprotein n- acylation with palmitoyl and tuberculostearyl residues was observed.


CONCLUSIONS
lipoproteins are triacylated in slow-growing mycobacteria. bcg_2070c encodes a functional lnt in m. bovis bcg. we identified mycobacteria-specific tuberculostearic acid as further substrate for n-acylation in slow-growing mycobacteria.
