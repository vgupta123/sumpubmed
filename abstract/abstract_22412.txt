BACKGROUND
there is a continuing need to develop molecular diagnostic tools which complement histopathologic examination to increase the accuracy of cancer diagnosis. dna microarrays provide a means for measuring gene expression signatures which can then be used as components of genomic-based diagnostic tests to determine the presence of cancer.


RESULTS
in this study, we collect and integrate ~  <dig> microarray gene expression profiles from  <dig> published cancer data sets across  <dig> major human cancer types. we then apply a statistical method, referred to as the top-scoring pair of groups  classifier, and a repeated random sampling strategy to the integrated training data sets and identify a common cancer signature consisting of  <dig> genes. these  <dig> genes are naturally divided into two distinct groups; those in one group are typically expressed less than those in the other group for cancer tissues. given a new expression profile, the classifier discriminates cancer from normal tissues by ranking the expression values of the  <dig> genes in the cancer signature and comparing the average ranks of the two groups. this signature is then validated by applying this decision rule to independent test data.


CONCLUSIONS
by combining the tspg method and repeated random sampling, a robust common cancer signature has been identified from large-scale microarray data integration. upon further validation, this signature may be useful as a robust and objective diagnostic test for cancer.
