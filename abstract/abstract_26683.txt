BACKGROUND
glucose is a signaling molecule which regulates multiple events in eukaryotic organisms and the most preferred carbon source in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe. the ability of this yeast to grow in the absence of glucose becomes strongly limited due to lack of enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle that support diauxic growth. the stress-activated protein kinase  pathway and its effectors, sty <dig> mapk and transcription factor atf <dig>  play a critical role in the adaptation of fission yeast to grow on alternative non-fermentable carbon sources by inducing the expression of fbp1+ gene, coding for the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase. the cell integrity pmk <dig> pathway is another mapk cascade that regulates various processes in fission yeast, including cell wall construction, cytokinesis, and ionic homeostasis. pmk <dig> pathway also becomes strongly activated in response to glucose deprivation but its role during glucose exhaustion and ensuing adaptation to respiratory metabolism is currently unknown.


RESULTS
we found that pmk <dig> activation in the absence of glucose takes place only after complete depletion of this carbon source and that such activation is not related to an endogenous oxidative stress. notably, pmk <dig> mapk activation relies on de novo protein synthesis, is independent on known upstream activators of the pathway like rho <dig> gtpase, and involves pkc ortholog pck <dig>  also, the glucose/camp pathway is required operative for full activation of the pmk <dig> signaling cascade. mutants lacking pmk <dig> displayed a partial growth defect in respiratory media which was not observed in the presence of glucose. this phenotype was accompanied by a decreased and delayed expression of transcription factor atf <dig> and target genes fbp1+ and pyp2+. intriguingly, the kinetics of sty <dig> activation in pmk1-less cells was clearly altered during growth adaptation to non-fermentable carbon sources.


CONCLUSIONS
unknown upstream elements mediate pck2-dependent signal transduction of glucose withdrawal to the cell integrity mapk pathway. this signaling cascade reinforces the adaptive response of fission yeast to such nutritional stress by enhancing the activity of the sapk pathway.
