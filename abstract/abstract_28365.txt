BACKGROUND
burkholderia sp. strain sj <dig> is known for its chemotaxis towards nitroaromatic compounds  that are either utilized as sole sources of carbon and energy or co-metabolized in the presence of alternative carbon sources. here we test for the chemotaxis of this strain towards six chloro-nitroaromatic compounds , namely 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol , 2-chloro-3-nitrophenol , 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol , 2-chloro-4-nitrobenzoate , 4-chloro-2-nitrobenzoate  and 5-chloro-2-nitrobenzoate , and examine its relationship to the degradation of such compounds.


RESULTS
strain sj <dig> could mineralize 2c4np, 4c2nb and 5c2nb, and co-metabolically transform 2c3np and 2c4nb in the presence of an alternative carbon source, but was unable to transform 4c2np under these conditions. positive chemotaxis was only observed towards the five metabolically transformed cnacs. moreover, the chemotaxis was induced by growth in the presence of the metabolisable cnac. it was also competitively inhibited by the presence of nitroaromatic compounds  that it could metabolise but not by succinate or aspartate.


CONCLUSIONS
burkholderia sp. strain sj <dig> exhibits metabolic transformation of, and inducible chemotaxis towards cnacs. its chemotactic responses towards these compounds are related to its previously demonstrated chemotaxis towards nacs that it can metabolise, but it is independently inducible from its chemotaxis towards succinate or aspartate.
