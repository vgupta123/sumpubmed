BACKGROUND
antimicrobial activity of anthraquinone compounds of emodine type has been reported by many authors. these compounds are found in vismia laurentii , a plant used in traditional pharmacopoeia for treatment of microbial infections among others affections. the continuous identification of new compounds has raised the problem of the relation between the structure and antimicrobial properties.


RESULTS
the yeast growth kinetics parameters were not influenced by the ph variation as it was the case for the other tested bacteria. fungicidal activities were noted for all molecules while only few of them had bactericidal activities, mostly on gram positive bacteria. mathematical model establishing a quantitative relationship between physicochemical properties of molecules and their fungicidal activities were obtained for candida albicans and showed that physicochemical properties impacting on antifungal activity were polarizability, partition coefficient, molecular weight and hydrogen bond acceptor.


CONCLUSIONS
this work demonstrated that the presence of a long aliphatic chain methoxy group substituted in position two of the emodine structure increased the antibacterial properties of the studied compounds. moreover this antimicrobial property depends on the ph of the environment, and specifically on the polarizability and number of hydrogen bond acceptors of the compound.
