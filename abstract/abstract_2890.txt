BACKGROUND
interspecific hybrids between s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii have frequently been detected in wine and beer fermentations. significant physiological differences among parental and hybrid strains under different stress conditions have been evidenced. in this study, we used comparative genome hybridization analysis to evaluate the genome composition of different s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii natural hybrids isolated from wine and beer fermentations to infer their evolutionary origins and to figure out the potential role of common s. kudriavzevii gene fraction present in these hybrids.


RESULTS
comparative genomic hybridization  and ploidy analyses carried out in this study confirmed the presence of individual and differential chromosomal composition patterns for most s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii hybrids from beer and wine. all hybrids share a common set of depleted s. cerevisiae genes, which also are depleted or absent in the wine strains studied so far, and the presence a common set of s. kudriavzevii genes, which may be associated with their capability to grow at low temperatures. finally, a maximum parsimony analysis of chromosomal rearrangement events, occurred in the hybrid genomes, indicated the presence of two main groups of wine hybrids and different divergent lineages of brewing strains.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that wine and beer s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii hybrids have been originated by different rare-mating events involving a diploid wine s. cerevisiae and a haploid or diploid european s. kudriavzevii strains. hybrids maintain several s. kudriavzevii genes involved in cold adaptation as well as those related to s. kudriavzevii mitochondrial functions.
