BACKGROUND
brassica oleracea encompass a family of vegetables and cabbage that are among the most widely cultivated crops. in  <dig>  the b. oleracea genome sequencing project was launched using next generation sequencing technology. none of the available maps were detailed enough to anchor the sequence scaffolds for the genome sequencing project. this report describes the development of a large number of ssr and snp markers from the whole genome shotgun sequence data of b. oleracea, and the construction of a high-density genetic linkage map using a double haploid mapping population.


RESULTS
the b. oleracea high-density genetic linkage map that was constructed includes  <dig>  markers in nine linkage groups spanning a total of  <dig>  cm with an average of  <dig>  cm between adjacent loci. there were  <dig> ssr markers and  <dig> snp markers on the map. the chromosome with the highest number of markers  was c <dig>  and the chromosome with smallest number of markers  was c <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this first high-density map allowed the assembled scaffolds to be anchored to pseudochromosomes. the map also provides useful information for positional cloning, molecular breeding, and integration of information of genes and traits in b. oleracea. all the markers on the map will be transferable and could be used for the construction of other genetic maps.
