BACKGROUND
micrornas  are short non-coding rna molecules that target mrnas to control gene expression by attenuating the translational efficiency and stability of transcripts. they are found in a wide variety of organisms, from plants to insects and humans. here, we use drosophila to investigate the possibility that circadian clocks regulate the expression of mirnas.


RESULTS
we used a microarray platform to survey the daily levels of d. melanogaster mirnas in adult heads of wildtype flies and the arrhythmic clock mutant cyc <dig>  we find two mirnas  that exhibit robust daily changes in abundance in wildtype flies that are abolished in the cyc <dig> mutant. dme-mir-263a and -263b reach trough levels during the daytime, peak during the night and their levels are constitutively elevated in cyc <dig> flies. a similar pattern of cycling is also observed in complete darkness, further supporting circadian regulation. in addition, we identified several mirnas that appear to be constitutively expressed but nevertheless differ in overall daily levels between control and cyc <dig> flies.


CONCLUSIONS
the circadian clock regulates mirna expression in drosophila, although this appears to be highly restricted to a small number of mirnas. a common mechanism likely underlies daily changes in the levels of dme-mir-263a and -263b. our results suggest that cycling mirnas contribute to daily changes in mrna and/or protein levels in drosophila. intriguingly, the mature forms of dme-mir-263a and -263b are very similar in sequence to several mirnas recently shown to be under circadian regulation in the mouse retina, suggesting conserved functions.
