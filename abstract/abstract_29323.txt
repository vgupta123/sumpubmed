BACKGROUND
helicases play crucial role in almost all the nucleic acid metabolism including replication, repair, recombination, transcription, translation, ribosome biogenesis and splicing and these processes regulate plant growth and development. it is suggested that helicases play essential roles in stabilizing growth in plants under stress because their presence in the stress-induced orfs has been identified. moreover in a recent study we have reported that suv <dig> helicase from oryza sativa  functions in salinity stress tolerance in transgenic rice by improving the antioxidant machinery. suv <dig> helicase has been identified and characterized from yeast and human systems but the properties and functions of plant suv <dig> are poorly understood.


RESULTS
in this study, the purification and extensive characterization of recombinant ossuv <dig> protein  is presented. ossuv <dig> binds to dna and rna and exhibits dna as well as rna-dependent atpase activities. it also contains the characteristic dna and rna helicase activity. ossuv <dig> can use mainly atp or datp as energy source for the unwinding activity and it cannot unwind the blunt-end duplex dna substrate. it is interesting to note that ossuv <dig> unwinds dna in both the 5’-3’ and 3’- <dig> directions and thus its activity is bipolar in vitro. the km values of ossuv <dig> are  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  nm for dna helicase and rna helicase, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first direct evidence to show the bipolar dna helicase activity of ossuv <dig> protein. the unique properties of ossuv <dig> including its dual helicase activity imply that it could be a multifunctional protein involved in biologically significant process of dna and rna metabolisms. these results should make significant contribution towards better understanding of suv <dig> protein in plants.
