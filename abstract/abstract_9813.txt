BACKGROUND
genomic copy number variants  involving > <dig> kb of dna have recently been found to be widely distributed throughout the human genome. they represent a newly recognized form of dna variation in normal populations, discovered through screening of the human genome using high-throughput and high resolution methods such as array comparative genomic hybridization . in order to understand their potential significance and to facilitate interpretation of array-cgh findings in constitutional disorders and cancers, we studied  <dig> normal individuals  using commercially available  <dig> mb resolution bac array . a selection of cnvs was further analyzed by fish and real-time quantitative pcr .


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> different cnvs were detected in  <dig> normal subjects. sixteen  were not previously reported. thirteen of the  <dig> cnvs  contained  <dig> genes listed in omim. fish analysis of  <dig> cnvs  in normal subjects resulted in the confirmation of copy number changes for  <dig> of  <dig> novel cnvs and  <dig> of  <dig> known cnvs. three cnvs tested by fish were further validated by rt-qpcr and comparable data were obtained. this included the lack of copy number change by both rt-qpcr and fish for clone rp11-100c <dig>  one of the most common known copy number variants, as well as confirmation of deletions for clones rp11-89m <dig> and rp5-1011o <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we have described  <dig> novel cnvs in  <dig> individuals. further study of a small selection of cnvs indicated concordant and discordant array vs. fish/rt-qpcr results. although a large number of cnvs has been reported to date, quantification using independent methods and detailed cellular and/or molecular assessment has been performed on a very small number of cnvs. this information is, however, very much needed as it is currently common practice to consider cnvs reported in normal subjects as benign changes when detected in individuals affected with a variety of developmental disorders.
