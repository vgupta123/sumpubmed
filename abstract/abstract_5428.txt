BACKGROUND
matrix metalloproteinase- <dig>  is a poorly understood member of the matrix metalloproteinase family. metalloproteinases are important mediators in the development of the nervous system and can contribute to the maturation of the neural micro-environment.


RESULTS
mmp- <dig> added to myelinating rat dorsal root ganglion  co-cultures reduces myelination and two antibodies targeted to mmp- <dig>  are capable of binding mmp- <dig> and inhibiting its activity in a dose-dependent manner. addition of  <dig> nm pab <dig> or pab <dig> to rat drg cultures resulted in the  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold enhancement of myelination respectively while addition of mmp- <dig> to drg co-cultures resulted in enhanced mapk, erbb <dig> and erbb <dig> phosphorylation. mmp- <dig> protein expression was increased within demyelinated lesions of mouse experimental autoimmune encephalitis  and human multiple sclerosis lesions compared to surrounding normal tissue.


CONCLUSIONS
mmp- <dig> is upregulated in conditions of demyelination in vivo, induces signaling in vitro consistent with myelination inhibition and, neutralization of mmp- <dig> activity can enhance myelination in vitro. these results suggest inhibition of mmp- <dig> may be beneficial under conditions of dysmyelination.
