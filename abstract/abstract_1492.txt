BACKGROUND
the ability of pathogens to adapt to the widely used biocide, triclosan, varies substantially. the purpose of the study was to examine bacterial adaptation over an extended period of time to low increments of triclosan concentrations. focus was two human pathogens, s. aureus and l. monocytogenes that previously have displayed inherent high and low adaptability, respectively.


RESULTS
three strains of l. monocytogenes and two strains of s. aureus including the community-acquired usa <dig> were exposed to increasing, sub-lethal concentrations of triclosan in triclosan-containing agar gradients. following 25 days of exposure on agar plates to sub-lethal concentrations of triclosan with a twofold concentration increase every second day, minimum inhibitory concentration  for s. aureus increased from  <dig>   and  <dig>   mg/l to 4 mg/l. the mic of all three l. monocytogenes strains was initially 4 mg/l and remained unaltered by the exposure. the adapted s. aureus isolates retained normal colony size but displayed increased expression of fabi encoding an essential enzyme in bacterial fatty acid synthesis. also, they displayed decreased or no expression of the virulence associated agrc of the agr quorum sensing system. while most adapted strains of usa <dig> carried mutations in fabi, none of the adapted strains of 8325– <dig> did.


CONCLUSIONS
adaptability to triclosan varies substantially between gram positive human pathogens. s. aureus displayed an intrinsically lower mic for triclosan compared to l. monocytogenes but was easily adapted leading to the same mic as l. monocytogenes. even though all adapted s. aureus strains over-expressed fabi and eliminated expression of the agr quorum sensing system, adaptation in usa <dig> involved fabi mutations whereas this was not the case for 8325– <dig>  thus, adaptation to triclosan by s. aureus appears to involve multiple genetic pathways.
