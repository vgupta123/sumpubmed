BACKGROUND
the downstream of tyrosine kinase/docking protein  adaptor protein family has seven members, dok <dig> to dok <dig>  that act as substrates of multiple receptor tyrosine kinase and non-receptor tyrosine kinase. the tropomyosin-related kinase  receptor family, which has three members , are receptor tyrosine kinases that play pivotal roles in many stages of nervous system development, such as differentiation, migration, axon and dendrite projection and neuron patterning. upon related neurotrophin growth factor stimulation, dimerisation and autophosphorylation of trk receptors can occur, recruiting adaptor proteins to mediate signal transduction.


RESULTS
in this report, by using yeast two-hybrid assays, glutathione s-transferase  precipitation assays and coimmunoprecipitation  experiments, we demonstrate that dok <dig> selectively binds to the npqy motif of trkc through its phosphotyrosine-binding  domain in a kinase activity-dependent manner. we further confirmed their interaction by coimmunoprecipitation and colocalisation in e <dig>  mouse cortex neurons, which provided more in vivo evidence. next, we demonstrated that dok <dig> is involved in neurite outgrowth in mouse cortex neurons via the rnai method. knockdown of dok <dig> decreased neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons upon neurotrophin  <dig>  stimulation.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that dok <dig> interacts with the npqy motif of the trkc receptor through its ptb domain in a kinase activity-dependent manner, and works as a novel substrate of the trkc receptor involved in nt-3-mediated neurite outgrowth in mouse cortex neurons.
