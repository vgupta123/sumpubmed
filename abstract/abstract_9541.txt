BACKGROUND
elucidation of the pig transcriptome is essential for interpreting functional elements of the genome and understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits such as fat deposition, metabolism and growth.


RESULTS
here we used massive parallel high-throughput rna sequencing to generate a high-resolution map of the porcine mrna and mirna transcriptome in liver, longissimus dorsi and abdominal fat from two full-sib f <dig> hybrid pigs with segregated phenotypes on growth, blood physiological and biochemical parameters, and fat deposition. we obtained  <dig> ,418- <dig> , <dig> uniquely mapped reads that covered  <dig> % of the current annotated transcripts and identified  <dig> - <dig>  novel transcript fragments, which constituted  <dig> - <dig>  novel transcriptional active regions in six tested samples. we found that about  <dig> % of the annotated genes showed alternative splicing patterns, and alternative 3' splicing is the most common type of alternative splicing events in pigs. cross-tissue comparison revealed that many transcriptional events are tissue-differential and related to important biological functions in their corresponding tissues. we also detected a total of  <dig> potential novel mirnas, most of which were tissue-specifically identified. integrated analysis of genome-wide association study and differential gene expression revealed interesting candidate genes for complex traits, such as igf <dig>  cyp1a <dig>  ckm and ces <dig> for heart weight, hemoglobin, pork ph value and serum cholesterol, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a global view of the complexity of the pig transcriptome, and gives an extensive new knowledge about alternative splicing, gene boundaries and mirnas in pigs. integrated analysis of genome wide association study and differential gene expression allows us to find important candidate genes for porcine complex traits.
