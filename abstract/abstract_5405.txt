BACKGROUND
members of comamonas testosteroni are environmental microorganisms that are usually found in polluted environment samples. they utilize steroids and aromatic compounds but rarely sugars, and show resistance to multiple heavy metals and multiple drugs. however, comprehensive genomic analysis among the c. testosteroni strains is lacked.


RESULTS
to understand the genome bases of the features of c. testosteroni, we sequenced  <dig> strains of this species and analyzed them together with other related published genome sequences. the results revealed that: 1) the strains of c. testosteroni have genome sizes ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb and g + c contents ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. the pan-genome contained  <dig>  gene families and the core genome contained  <dig>  gene families. heap’s law analysis indicated that the pan-genome of c. testosteroni may be open ; 2) by analyzing  <dig> phenotypes of  <dig> available c. testosteroni strains,  <dig> % of the genotypes  were found to be correlated to the phenotypes, indicating a high correlation between phenotypes and genotypes; 3) gene clusters for nitrate reduction, steroids degradation and metal and multi-drug resistance were found and were highly conserved among all the genomes of this species; 4) the genome similarity of c. testosteroni may be related to the geographical distances.


CONCLUSIONS
this work provided an overview on the genomes of c. testosteroni and new genome resources that would accelerate the further investigations of this species. importantly, this work focused on the analysis of potential genetic determinants for the typical characters and found high correlation between the phenotypes and their corresponding genotypes.
