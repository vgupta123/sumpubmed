BACKGROUND
vertebrate sws <dig> visual pigments mediate visual transduction in response to light at short wavelengths. due to their importance in vision, sws <dig> genes have been isolated from a surprisingly wide range of vertebrates, including lampreys, teleosts, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. the sws <dig> genes exhibit many of the characteristics of genes typically targeted for phylogenetic analyses. this study investigates both the utility of sws <dig> as a marker for inferring vertebrate phylogenetic relationships, and the characteristics of the gene that contribute to its phylogenetic utility.


RESULTS
phylogenetic analyses of vertebrate sws <dig> genes produced topologies that were remarkably congruent with generally accepted hypotheses of vertebrate evolution at both higher and lower taxonomic levels. the few exceptions were generally associated with areas of poor taxonomic sampling, or relationships that have been difficult to resolve using other molecular markers. the sws <dig> data set was characterized by a substantial amount of among-site rate variation, and a relatively unskewed substitution rate matrix, even when the data were partitioned into different codon sites and individual taxonomic groups. although there were nucleotide biases in some groups at third positions, these biases were not convergent across different taxonomic groups.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that sws <dig> may be a good marker for vertebrate phylogenetics due to the variable yet consistent patterns of sequence evolution exhibited across fairly wide taxonomic groups. this may result from constraints imposed by the functional role of sws <dig> pigments in visual transduction.
