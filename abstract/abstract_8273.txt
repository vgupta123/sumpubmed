BACKGROUND
the arabidopsis seuss  gene encodes a transcriptional adaptor protein that is required for a diverse set of developmental events, including floral organ identity specification, as well as gynoecium, ovule and embryo development. in order to better understand the molecular mechanisms of seuss action we undertook a genetic modifier screen to identify seuss-modifier  mutations.


RESULTS
screening of m <dig> lines representing approximately  <dig>  m <dig> individuals identified mutations that enhance the seuss mutant phenotypic disruptions in ovules and gynoecia; here we describe the phenotype of the sum <dig> mutant and enhanced disruptions of ovule and gynoecial development in the seu sum <dig> double mutant. mapping and genetic complementation tests indicate that sum <dig> is allelic to cyp85a <dig>  a cytochrome p <dig> enzyme that catalyzes the final steps in the synthesis of the phytohormone brassinolide.


CONCLUSIONS
our identification of mutations in cyp85a <dig> as enhancers of the seuss mutant phenotype suggests a previously unrecognized role for brassinolide synthesis in gynoecial and ovule outer integument development. the work also suggests that seuss mutants may be more sensitive to the loss or reduction of brassinolide synthesis than are wild type plants.
