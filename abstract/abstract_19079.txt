BACKGROUND
mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate  dehydrogenase complex , a key regulatory point of tricarboxylic acid  cycle, plays vital roles in multiple pathways of energy metabolism and biosynthesis. the catalytic mechanism and allosteric regulation of this large enzyme complex are not fully understood. here computer simulation is used to test possible catalytic mechanisms and mechanisms of allosteric regulation of the enzyme by nucleotides , ph, and metal ion cofactors .


RESULTS
a model was developed based on an ordered ter-ter enzyme kinetic mechanism combined with con-formational changes that involve rotation of one lipoic acid between three catalytic sites inside the enzyme complex. the model was parameterized using a large number of kinetic data sets on the activity of ogdhc, and validated by comparison of model predictions to independent data.


CONCLUSIONS
the developed model suggests a hybrid rapid-equilibrium ping-pong random mechanism for the kinetics of ogdhc, consistent with previously reported mechanisms, and accurately describes the experimentally observed regulatory effects of cofactors on the ogdhc activity. this analysis provides a single consistent theoretical explanation for a number of apparently contradictory results on the roles of phosphorylation potential, nad  oxidation-reduction state ratio, as well as the regulatory effects of metal ions on odghc function.
