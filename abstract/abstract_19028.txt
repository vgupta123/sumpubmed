BACKGROUND
the american cranberry  is one of only three widely-cultivated fruit crops native to north america- the other two are blueberry  and native grape . in terms of taxonomy, cranberries are in the core ericales, an order for which genome sequence data are currently lacking. in addition, cranberries produce a host of important polyphenolic secondary compounds, some of which are beneficial to human health. whereas next-generation sequencing technology is allowing the advancement of whole-genome sequencing, one major obstacle to the successful assembly from short-read sequence data of complex diploid  organisms is heterozygosity. cranberry has the advantage of being diploid  and self-fertile. to minimize the issue of heterozygosity, we sequenced the genome of a fifth-generation inbred genotype  derived from five generations of selfing originating from the cultivar ben lear.


RESULTS
the genome size of v. macrocarpon has been estimated to be about  <dig> mb. genomic sequences were assembled into  <dig>  scaffolds representing  <dig> mbp  with 20x average coverage. the number of predicted genes was  <dig>  and represents  <dig> % of the assembled genome. of the predicted genes,  <dig>  were assigned to candidate genes based on homology. genes supported by transcriptome data totaled  <dig>  .


CONCLUSIONS
shotgun sequencing of the cranberry genome, with an average sequencing coverage of 20x, allowed efficient assembly and gene calling. the candidate genes identified represent a useful collection to further study important biochemical pathways and cellular processes and to use for marker development for breeding and the study of horticultural characteristics, such as disease resistance.
