BACKGROUND
the assortment of cattle immunoglobulin and surrogate light chain genes has been extracted from the version  <dig>  of bos taurus genome sequence as a part of an international effort to sequence and annotate the bovine genome.


RESULTS
 <dig> variable lambda chain and  <dig> variable kappa chain genes were identified and phylogenetically assigned to  <dig> and  <dig> subgroups, respectively. the specified phylogenetic relationships are compatible with the established ruminant light chain variable gene families or subgroups. because of gaps and uncertainties in the assembled genome sequence, the number of genes might change in the future versions of the genome sequence. in addition, three bovine surrogate light chain genes were identified. the corresponding cdnas were cloned and the expression of the surrogate light chain genes was demonstrated from fetal material.


CONCLUSIONS
the bovine kappa gene locus is compact and simple which may reflect the preferential use of the lambda chain in cattle. the relative orientation of variable and joining genes in both loci are consistent with a deletion mechanism in vj joining. the orientation of some variable genes cannot be determined from the data available. the number of functional variable genes is moderate when compared to man or mouse. thus, post-recombinatorial mechanisms might contribute to the generation of the bovine pre-immune antibody repertoire. the heavy chains probably contribute more to recombinational immunoglobulin repertoire diversity than the light chains but the heavy chain locus could not be annotated from the version  <dig>  of bos taurus genome.
