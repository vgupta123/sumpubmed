BACKGROUND
fusarium oxysporum is one of the most common fungal pathogens causing soybean root rot and seedling blight in u.s.a. in a recent study, significant variation in aggressiveness was observed among isolates of f. oxysporum collected from roots in iowa, ranging from highly pathogenic to weakly or non-pathogenic isolates.


RESULTS
we used rna-seq analysis to investigate the molecular aspects of the interactions of a partially resistant soybean genotype with non-pathogenic/pathogenic isolates of f. oxysporum at  <dig> and 96 h post inoculation . markedly different gene expression profiles were observed in response to the two isolates. a peak of highly differentially expressed genes  was triggered at  <dig> hpi in soybean roots and the number of hdegs was about eight times higher in response to the pathogenic isolate compared to the non-pathogenic one . furthermore, the magnitude of induction was much greater in response to the pathogenic isolate. this response included a stronger activation of defense-related genes, transcription factors, and genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis, secondary and sugar metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
the obtained data provide an important insight into the transcriptional responses of soybean-f. oxysporum interactions and illustrate the more drastic changes in the host transcriptome in response to the pathogenic isolate. these results may be useful in the developing new methods of broadening resistance of soybean to f. oxysporum, including the over-expression of key soybean genes.
