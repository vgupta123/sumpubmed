BACKGROUND
the multifunctional protein phosphatase 2a  is a heterotrimeric serine/threonine protein phosphatase composed of a scaffolding, catalytic and regulatory subunits. by modifying various downstream signal transducers, the aberrant expression of the brain-targeted regulatory subunit ppp2r2b is associated with the onset of a panel of neuronal disorders. the alternatively splicing of ppp2r2b encodes two regulatory subunit isoforms that determine cellular distribution of the neuron-specific holoenzyme to mitochondria  and cytoplasm , respectively.


RESULTS
human neuroblastoma cells were transfected with ppp2r2b constructs encoding the complete sequences of bβ <dig> and bβ <dig>  respectively. the colonies with antibiotic resistance were selected as stable cell lines. both ectopic bβ <dig> and bβ <dig> clones exhibited characteristics of autophagy. to test how cells respond to reactive oxygen species generators, the cells were treated with either hydrogen peroxide or t-butyl hydroperoxide and bβ <dig> clones induced cell death. suppression of autophagy using either rna interference of the essential autophagy gene or pharmacological inhibitor rescued cell death caused by oxidative stress.


CONCLUSIONS
cells with ectopically expressed mitochondria-targeted regulatory subunit ppp2r2b of the holoenzyme pp2a were shown predisposed to autophagy and oxidative stress induced cell death that is related to apoptosis. the results promised a model for studying the mechanism and function of aberrant ppp2r2b expression in neuronal cells. the work provided a new target for understanding and prevention of neuropathogenesis.
