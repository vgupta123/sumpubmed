BACKGROUND
lamins a and c, two major structural components of the nuclear lamina that determine nuclear shape and size, are phosphoproteins. phosphorylation of lamin a/c is cell cycle-dependent and is involved in regulating the assemblyâ€“disassembly of lamin filaments during mitosis. we previously reported that p-stm, a phosphoepitope-specific antibody raised against the autophosphorylation site of p21-activated kinase  <dig>  recognizes a number of phosphoproteins, including lamins a and c, in mitotic hela cells.


RESULTS
here, using recombinant proteins and synthetic phosphopeptides containing potential lamin a/c phosphorylation sites in conjunction with in vitro phosphorylation assays, we determined the lamin a/c phosphoepitope recognized by p-stm. we found that phosphorylation of thr- <dig> is required for generating the p-stm phosphoepitope in lamin a/c and showed that it could be created in vitro by p34cdc2/cyclin b kinase -catalyzed phosphorylation of lamin a/c immunoprecipitated from unsynchronized hela s <dig> cells. to further explore changes in lamin a/c phosphorylation in living cells, we precisely quantified the phosphorylation levels of thr- <dig> and other sites in lamin a/c isolated from hela s <dig> cells at interphase and mitosis using the silac method and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. the results showed that the levels of phosphorylated thr- <dig>  ser- <dig> and ser- <dig> in both lamins a and c, and ser- <dig> in lamin a only, increased ~2- to 6-fold in mitotic hela s <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our results demonstrate that p-stm is a useful tool for detecting thr-19-phosphorylated lamin a/c in cells and reveal quantitative changes in the phosphorylation status of major lamin a/c phosphorylation sites during mitosis.
