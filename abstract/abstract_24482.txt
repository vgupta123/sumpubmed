BACKGROUND
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors  play an important role as excitatory neurotransmitters in vertebrate and invertebrate species. in insects, nachrs are the site of action of commercially important insecticides and, as a consequence, there is considerable interest in examining their functional properties. however, problems have been encountered in the successful functional expression of insect nachrs, although a number of strategies have been developed in an attempt to overcome such difficulties. ten nachr subunits have been identified in the model insect drosophila melanogaster  and a similar number have been identified in other insect species. the focus of the present study is the dα <dig>  dα <dig> and dα <dig> subunits, which are distinguished by their sequence similarity to one another and also by their close similarity to the vertebrate α <dig> nachr subunit.


RESULTS
a full-length cdna clone encoding the drosophila nachr dα <dig> subunit has been isolated and the properties of dα5-, dα6- and dα7-containing nachrs examined in a variety of cell expression systems. we have demonstrated the functional expression, as homomeric nachrs, of the dα <dig> and dα <dig> subunits in xenopus oocytes by their co-expression with the molecular chaperone ric- <dig>  also, using a similar approach, we have demonstrated the functional expression of a heteromeric ‘triplet’ nachr  with substantially higher apparent affinity for acetylcholine than is seen with other subunit combinations. in addition, specific cell-surface binding of -α-bungarotoxin was detected in both drosophila and mammalian cell lines when dα <dig> was co-expressed with dα <dig> and ric- <dig>  in contrast, co-expression of additional subunits  with dα <dig> and dα <dig> prevented specific binding of -α-bungarotoxin in cell lines, suggesting that co-assembly with other nachr subunits can block maturation of correctly folded nachrs in some cellular environments.


CONCLUSIONS
data are presented demonstrating the ability of the drosophila dα <dig> and dα <dig> subunits to generate functional homomeric and also heteromeric nachrs.
