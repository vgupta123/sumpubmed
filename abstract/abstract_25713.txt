BACKGROUND
although the high mobility group a <dig>  gene is widely overexpressed in diverse cancers and portends a poor prognosis in some tumors, the molecular mechanisms that mediate its role in transformation have remained elusive. hmga <dig> functions as a potent oncogene in cultured cells and induces aggressive lymphoid tumors in transgenic mice. because hmga <dig> chromatin remodeling proteins regulate transcription, hmga <dig> is thought to drive malignant transformation by modulating expression of specific genes. genome-wide studies to define hmga <dig> transcriptional networks during tumorigenesis, however, are lacking. to define the hmga <dig> transcriptome, we analyzed gene expression profiles in lymphoid cells from hmga1a transgenic mice at different stages in tumorigenesis.


RESULTS
rna from lymphoid samples at  <dig> months  and  <dig> months  was screened for differential expression of >  <dig>  unique genes by microarray analysis  using a parametric and nonparametric approach. differential expression was confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr in a subset of genes. differentially expressed genes were analyzed for cellular pathways and functions using ingenuity pathway analysis. early in tumorigenesis, hmga <dig> induced inflammatory pathways with nfkappab identified as a major node. in established tumors, hmga <dig> induced pathways involved in cell cycle progression, cell-mediated immune response, and cancer. at both stages in tumorigenesis, hmga <dig> induced pathways involved in cellular development, hematopoiesis, and hematologic development. gene set enrichment analysis showed that stem cell and immature t cell genes are enriched in the established tumors. to determine if these results are relevant to human tumors, we knocked-down hmga <dig> in human t-cell leukemia cells and identified a subset of genes dysregulated in both the transgenic and human lymphoid tumors.


CONCLUSIONS
we found that hmga <dig> induces inflammatory pathways early in lymphoid tumorigenesis and pathways involved in stem cells, cell cycle progression, and cancer in established tumors. hmga <dig> also dyregulates genes and pathways involved in stem cells, cellular development and hematopoiesis at both early and late stages of tumorigenesis. these results provide insight into hmga <dig> function during tumor development and point to cellular pathways that could serve as therapeutic targets in lymphoid and other human cancers with aberrant hmga <dig> expression.
