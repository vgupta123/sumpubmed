BACKGROUND
the p <dig> protein is a master regulator that controls the transcription of many genes in various pathways in response to a variety of stress signals. the extent of this regulation depends in part on the binding affinity of p <dig> to its response elements . traditional profile scores for p <dig> based on position weight matrices  are only a weak indicator of binding affinity because the level of binding also depends on various other factors such as interaction between the nucleotides and, in case of p53-res, the extent of the spacer between the dimers.


RESULTS
in the current study we introduce a novel in-silico predictor for p53-re transactivation capability based on a combination of multidimensional scaling and multinomial logistic regression. experimentally validated known p53-res along with their transactivation capabilities are used for training. through cross-validation studies we show that our method outperforms other existing methods. to demonstrate the utility of this method we  rank putative p53-res of target genes and target micrornas based on the predicted transactivation capability and  study the implication of polymorphisms overlapping p53-re on its transactivation capability.


CONCLUSIONS
taking into account both nucleotide interactions and the spacer length of p53-re, we have created a novel in-silico regression-based transactivation capability predictor for p53-res and used it to analyze validated and novel p53-res and to predict the impact of snps overlapping these elements.
