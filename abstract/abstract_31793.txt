BACKGROUND
the usefulness of available vaccine and serological tests for leptospirosis is limited by the low cross-reactivity of antigens from numerous serovars of pathogenic leptospira spp. identification of genus-specific protein antigens  of leptospira would be important for development of universal vaccines and serodiagnostic methods. ompl <dig>  a transmembrane porin of pathogenic leptospires, was identified as a possible gp-ag, but its sequence diversity and immune cross-reactivity among different serovars of pathogenic leptospires remains largely unknown.


RESULTS
pcr analysis demonstrated that the ompl <dig> gene existed in all  <dig> official chinese standard strains as well as  <dig> clinical strains of pathogenic leptospires isolated in china. in the standard strains, the ompl <dig> gene could be divided into three groups  according to their sequence identities. immune electron microscopy demonstrated that all products of the different gene types of ompl <dig> are located on the surface of leptospires. the microscopic agglutination test revealed extensive yet distinct cross-immunoagglutination among the antisera against recombinant ompl <dig>  and leptospiral strains belonging to different ompl <dig> gene types. these cross-immunoreactions were further verified by elisas using the ompl <dig> proteins as the coated antigens in serum samples from  <dig> leptospirosis patients. all the antisera against rompl <dig> proteins could inhibit l. interrogans strain lai from adhering to j774a. <dig> cells. furthermore, immunization of guinea pigs with each of the rompl <dig> proteins could cause cross-immunoprotection against lethal challenge with leptospires from different ompl <dig> gene types.


CONCLUSIONS
three types of the ompl <dig> gene are present in pathogenic leptospires in china. ompl <dig> is an immunoprotective gp-ag which should be considered in the design of new universal vaccines and serodiagnostic methods against leptospirosis.
