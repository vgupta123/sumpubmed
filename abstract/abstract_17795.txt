BACKGROUND
spectraclassifier  is a java solution for designing and implementing magnetic resonance spectroscopy -based classifiers. the main goal of sc is to allow users with minimum background knowledge of multivariate statistics to perform a fully automated pattern recognition analysis. sc incorporates feature selection , and feature extraction . fisher linear discriminant analysis is the method of choice for classification. classifier evaluation is performed through various methods: display of the confusion matrix of the training and testing datasets; k-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out and bootstrapping as well as receiver operating characteristic  curves.


RESULTS
sc is composed of the following modules: classifier design, data exploration, data visualisation, classifier evaluation, reports, and classifier history. it is able to read low resolution in-vivo mrs  and high resolution tissue mrs , processed with existing tools . in addition, to facilitate exchanging data between applications, a standard format capable of storing all the information needed for a dataset was developed. each functionality of sc has been specifically validated with real data with the purpose of bug-testing and methods validation. data from the interpret project was used.


CONCLUSIONS
sc is a user-friendly software designed to fulfil the needs of potential users in the mrs community. it accepts all kinds of pre-processed mrs data types and classifies them semi-automatically, allowing spectroscopists to concentrate on interpretation of results with the use of its visualisation tools.
