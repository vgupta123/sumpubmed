BACKGROUND
in the area of protein structure prediction, recently a lot of effort has gone into the development of model quality assessment programs . mqaps distinguish high quality protein structure models from inferior models. here, we propose a new method to use an mqap to improve the quality of models. with a given target sequence and template structure, we construct a number of different alignments and corresponding models for the sequence. the quality of these models is scored with an mqap and used to choose the most promising model. an svm-based selection scheme is suggested for combining mqap partial potentials, in order to optimize for improved model selection.


RESULTS
the approach has been tested on a representative set of proteins. the ability of the method to improve models was validated by comparing the mqap-selected structures to the native structures with the model quality evaluation program tm-score. using the svm-based model selection, a significant increase in model quality is obtained . the average increase in tmscore is  <dig> , the maximum observed increase in tm-score is  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
in template-based protein structure prediction alignment is known to be a bottleneck limiting the overall model quality. here we show that a combination of systematic alignment variation and modern model scoring functions can significantly improve the quality of alignment-based models.
