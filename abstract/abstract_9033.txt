BACKGROUND
genomics of rye  is impeded by its large nuclear genome  with prevalence of dna repeats . an attractive possibility is to dissect the genome to small parts after flow sorting particular chromosomes and chromosome arms. to test this approach, we have chosen 1rs chromosome arm, which represents only  <dig> % of the total rye genome. the 1rs arm is an attractive target as it carries many important genes and because it became part of the wheat gene pool as the 1bl.1rs translocation.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that it is possible to sort 1rs arm from wheat-rye ditelosomic addition line. using this approach, we isolated over  <dig> million of 1rs arms using flow sorting and used their dna to construct a 1rs-specific bac library, which comprises  <dig>  clones with average insert size of  <dig> kb. the library comprises two sublibraries constructed using hindiii and ecori and provides a deep coverage of about 14-fold of the 1rs arm . we present preliminary results obtained during positional cloning of the stem rust resistance gene srr, which confirm a potential of the library to speed up isolation of agronomically important genes by map-based cloning.


CONCLUSIONS
we present a strategy that enables sorting short arms of several chromosomes of rye. using flow-sorted chromosomes, we have constructed a deep coverage bac library specific for the short arm of chromosome 1r . this is the first subgenomic bac library available for rye and we demonstrate its potential for positional gene cloning. we expect that the library will facilitate development of a physical contig map of 1rs and comparative genomics of the homoeologous chromosome group  <dig> of wheat, barley and rye.
