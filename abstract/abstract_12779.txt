BACKGROUND
serine proteinase inhibitors  are a large superfamily of structurally related, but functionally diverse proteins that control essential proteolytic pathways in most branches of life. given their importance in the biology of many organisms, the concept that ticks might utilize serpins to evade host defenses and immunizing against or disrupting their functions as targets for tick control is an appealing option.


RESULTS
a sequence homology search strategy has allowed us to identify at least  <dig> tick serpin genes in the ixodes scapularis genome that are structurally segregated into  <dig> intronless and  <dig> intron-containing genes. nine of the intron-containing serpins occur in a cluster of  <dig> genes that span  <dig> kb of dna sequence. based on consensus amino acid residues in the reactive center loop  and signal peptide scanning, 93% are putatively inhibitory while 82% are putatively extracellular. among the  <dig> different amino acid residues that are predicted at the p <dig> sites,  <dig> sequences possess basic amino acid  residues. temporal and spatial expression analyses revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> serpins are differentially expressed in salivary glands  and/or midguts  of unfed and partially fed ticks. ten of the  <dig> serpin genes were expressed from six to  <dig> hrs of feeding while six and fives genes each are predominantly or exclusively expressed in either mg and sg respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
given the diversity among tick species, sizes of tick serpin families are likely to be variable. however this study provides insight on the potential sizes of serpin protein families in ticks. ticks must overcome inflammation, complement activation and blood coagulation to complete feeding. since these pathways are regulated by serpins that have basic residues at their p <dig> sites, we speculate that i. scapularis may utilize some of the serpins reported in this study to manipulate host defense. we have discussed our data in the context of advances on the molecular physiology of i. scapularis. although the paper is descriptive, this study provides the first step toward a comprehensive understanding of serpins in tick physiology.
