BACKGROUND
micrornas  and other types of small regulatory rnas play critical roles in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in plants. cotton is one of the most economically important crops, but little is known about the roles of mirnas during cotton fiber elongation.


RESULTS
here, we combined high-throughput sequencing with computational analysis to identify small rnas  related to cotton fiber elongation in gossypium hirsutum l. . the sequence analysis confirmed the expression of  <dig> known mirna families in elongating fiber cells and identified  <dig> novel mirnas, primarily derived from corresponding specific loci in the gossypium raimondii ulbr.  genome. furthermore, a comparison of the mirnaomes revealed that  <dig> mirna families were differentially expressed throughout the elongation period. importantly, the predicted and experimentally validated targets of eight mirnas were associated with fiber elongation, with obvious functional relationships with calcium and auxin signal transduction, fatty acid metabolism, anthocyanin synthesis and the xylem tissue differentiation. moreover, one tasirna was also identified, and its target, arf <dig>  was experimentally validated in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
this study not only facilitated the discovery of  <dig> novel low-abundance mirnas in elongating cotton fiber cells but also revealed a potential regulatory network of nine srnas important for fiber elongation. the identification and characterization of mirnas in elongating cotton fiber cells might promote the further study of fiber mirna regulation mechanisms and provide insight into the importance of mirnas in cotton.
