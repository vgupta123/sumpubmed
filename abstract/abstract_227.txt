BACKGROUND
microrna , which is short non-coding rna, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of many biological processes and affects the stability and/or translation of mrna. recently, machine learning algorithms were developed to predict potential mirna targets. most of these methods are robust but are not sensitive to redundant or irrelevant features. despite their good performance, the relative importance of each feature is still unclear. with increasing experimental data becoming available, research interest has shifted from higher prediction performance to uncovering the mechanism of microrna-mrna interactions.


RESULTS
systematic analysis of sequence, structural and positional features was carried out for two different data sets. the dominant functional features were distinguished from uninformative features in single and hybrid feature sets. models were developed using only statistically significant sequence, structural and positional features, resulting in area under the receiver operating curves  values of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for one data set and of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for another data set, respectively. hybrid models were developed by combining various features and achieved auc of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for two different data sets. functional mirna information is well reflected in these features, which are expected to be valuable in understanding the mechanism of microrna-mrna interactions and in designing experiments.


CONCLUSIONS
differing from previous approaches, this study focused on systematic analysis of all types of features. statistically significant features were identified and used to construct models that yield similar accuracy to previous studies in a shorter computation time.
