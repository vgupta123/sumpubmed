BACKGROUND
the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of  <dig>  fraction of inspired oxygen  and > <dig>  fio <dig> on pulmonary gas exchange, shunt fraction and oxygen delivery  in dorsally recumbent horses during inhalant anesthesia. the use of  <dig>  fio <dig> has the potential to reduce absorption atelectasis  and augment alveolar oxygen  tensions  thereby improving gas exchange and do <dig>  our hypothesis was that  <dig>  fio <dig> would reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatching and increase the fraction of pulmonary blood flow that is oxygenated, thus improving arterial oxygen content and do <dig> 


RESULTS
arterial partial pressures of o <dig> were significantly higher than preanesthetic levels at all times during anesthesia in the > <dig>  fio <dig> group. arterial partial pressures of o <dig> did not change from preanesthetic levels in the  <dig>  fio <dig> group but were significantly lower than in the > <dig>  fio <dig> group from  <dig> to  <dig> min of anesthesia. alveolar to arterial o <dig> tension difference was increased significantly in both groups during anesthesia compared to preanesthetic values. the alveolar to arterial o <dig> tension difference was significantly higher at all times in the > <dig>  fio <dig> group compared to the  <dig>  fio <dig> group. oxygen delivery did not change from preanesthetic values in either group during anesthesia but was significantly lower than preanesthetic values  <dig> min after anesthesia in the  <dig>  fio <dig> group. shunt fraction increased in both groups during anesthesia attaining statistical significance at varying times. shunt fraction was significantly increased in both groups  <dig> min after anesthesia but was not different between groups. alveolar dead space ventilation increased after  <dig> hr of anesthesia in both groups.


CONCLUSIONS
reducing fio <dig> did not change alveolar dead space ventilation or shunt fraction in dorsally recumbent, mechanically ventilated horses during  <dig> hr of isoflurane anesthesia. reducing fio <dig> in dorsally recumbent isoflurane anesthetized horses does not improve oxygenation or oxygen delivery.
