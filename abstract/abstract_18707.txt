BACKGROUND
escherichia coli has been most widely used for the production of valuable recombinant proteins. however, over-production of heterologous proteins in e. coli frequently leads to their misfolding and aggregation yielding inclusion bodies. previous attempts to refold the inclusion bodies into bioactive forms usually result in poor recovery and account for the major cost in industrial production of desired proteins from recombinant e. coli. here, we describe the successful use of the immobilized folding machineries for in vitro refolding with the examples of high yield refolding of a ribonuclease a  and cyclohexanone monooxygenase .


RESULTS
we have generated refolding-facilitating media immobilized with three folding machineries, mini-chaperone  and two foldases  by mimicking oxidative refolding chromatography. for efficient and simple purification and immobilization simultaneously, folding machineries were fused with the positively-charged consecutive 10-arginine tag at their c-terminal. the immobilized folding machineries were fully functional when assayed in a batch mode. when the refolding-facilitating matrices were applied to the refolding of denatured and reduced rnase a and chmo, both of which contain many cysteine and proline residues, rnase a and chmo were recovered in 73% and 53% yield of soluble protein with full enzyme activity, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the refolding-facilitating media presented here could be a cost-efficient platform and should be applicable to refold a wide range of e. coli inclusion bodies in high yield with biological function.
