BACKGROUND
the characterization of protein binding sites is a major challenge in computational biology. proteins interact with a wide variety of molecules and understanding of such complex interactions is essential to gain deeper knowledge of protein function. shape complementarity is known to be important in determining protein-ligand interactions. furthermore, these protein structural features have been shown to be useful in assisting medicinal chemists during lead discovery and optimization.


RESULTS
we developed kvfinder, a highly versatile and easy-to-use tool for cavity prospection and spatial characterization. kvfinder is a geometry-based method that has an innovative customization of the search space. this feature provides the possibility of cavity segmentation, which alongside with the large set of customizable parameters, allows detailed cavity analyses. although the main focus of kvfinder is the steered prospection of cavities, we tested it against a benchmark dataset of  <dig> known drug targets in order to validate our software and compare it with some of the largely accepted methods. using the one click mode, we performed better than most of the other methods, staying behind only of hybrid prospection methods. when using just one of kvfinderâ€™s customizable features, we were able to outperform all other compared methods. kvfinder is also user friendly, as it is available as a pymol plugin, or command-line version.


CONCLUSIONS
kvfinder presents novel usability features, granting full customizable and highly detailed cavity prospection on proteins, alongside with a friendly graphical interface. kvfinder is freely available on http://lnbio.cnpem.br/bioinformatics/main/software/.
