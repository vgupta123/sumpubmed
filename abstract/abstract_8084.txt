BACKGROUND
the ghrelin axis is involved in the regulation of metabolism, energy balance, and the immune, cardiovascular and reproductive systems. the manipulation of this axis has potential for improving economically valuable traits in production animals, and polymorphisms in the ghrelin  and ghrelin receptor  genes have been associated with growth and carcass traits. here we investigate the structure and expression of the ghrelin gene  in sheep, ovis aries.


RESULTS
we identify two ghrelin mrna isoforms, which we have designated Δex <dig> preproghrelin and Δex <dig>  preproghrelin. expression of Δex <dig>  preproghrelin is likely to be restricted to ruminants, and would encode truncated ghrelin and a novel c-terminal peptide. both Δex <dig> preproghrelin and canonical preproghrelin mrna isoforms were expressed in a range of tissues. expression of the Δex <dig>  preproghrelin isoform, however, was restricted to white blood cells , and gastrointestinal tissues. expression of Δex <dig> preproghrelin and Δex <dig>  preproghrelin mrna was elevated in white blood cells in response to parasitic worm  infection in genetically susceptible sheep, but not in resistant sheep.


CONCLUSIONS
the restricted expression of the novel preproghrelin variants and their distinct wbc expression pattern during parasite infection may indicate a novel link between the ghrelin axis and metabolic and immune function in ruminants.
