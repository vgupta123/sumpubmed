BACKGROUND
protein solvent accessibility prediction is a pivotal intermediate step towards modeling protein tertiary structures directly from one-dimensional sequences. it also plays an important part in identifying protein folds and domains. although some methods have been presented to the protein solvent accessibility prediction in recent years, the performance is far from satisfactory. in this work, we propose predrsa, a computational method that can accurately predict relative solvent accessible surface area  of residues by exploring various local and global sequence features which have been observed to be associated with solvent accessibility. based on these features, a novel and efficient approach, gradient boosted regression trees , is first adopted to predict rsa.


RESULTS
experimental results obtained from 5-fold cross-validation based on the manesh- <dig> dataset show that the mean absolute error  and the pearson correlation coefficient  of predrsa are  <dig>  % and  <dig> , respectively, which are better than that of the existing methods. moreover, we evaluate the performance of predrsa using an independent test set of  <dig> proteins. compared with the state-of-the-art approaches , predrsa achieves a significant improvement on the prediction quality.


CONCLUSIONS
our experimental results show that the gradient boosted regression trees algorithm and the novel feature combination are quite effective in relative solvent accessibility prediction. the proposed predrsa method could be useful in assisting the prediction of protein structures by applying the predicted rsa as useful restraints.
