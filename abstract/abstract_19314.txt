BACKGROUND
networks are ubiquitous in modern cell biology and physiology. a large literature exists for inferring/proposing biological pathways/networks using statistical or machine learning algorithms. despite these advances a formal testing procedure for analyzing network-level observations is in need of further development. comparing the behaviour of a pharmacologically altered pathway to its canonical form is an example of a salient one-sample comparison. locating which pathways differentiate disease from no-disease phenotype may be recast as a two-sample network inference problem.


RESULTS
we outline an inferential method for performing one- and two-sample hypothesis tests where the sampling unit is a network and the hypotheses are stated via network model. we propose a dissimilarity measure that incorporates nearby neighbour information to contrast one or more networks in a statistical test. we demonstrate and explore the utility of our approach with both simulated and microarray data; random graphs and weighted  correlation networks are used to form network models. using both a well-known diabetes dataset and an ovarian cancer dataset, the methods outlined here could better elucidate co-regulation changes for one or more pathways between two clinically relevant phenotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
formal hypothesis tests for gene- or protein-based networks are a logical progression from existing gene-based and gene-set tests for differential expression. commensurate with the growing appreciation and development of systems biology, the dissimilarity-based testing methods presented here may allow us to improve our understanding of pathways and other complex regulatory systems. the benefit of our method was illustrated under select scenarios.
