BACKGROUND
recovery following stroke depends on cellular plasticity in the perilesional zone . doublecortin , a protein mainly labeling immature neurons in neurogenic niches is also highly expressed in the vicinity of focal cortical infarcts. notably, the number of dcx+ cells positively correlates with the recovery of functional deficits after stroke though the nature and origin of these cells remains unclear.


RESULTS
in the present study, we aimed to characterize the population of dcx+ cells in the vicinity of ischemic infarcts in a mouse model in detail. employing a photothrombosis model, distinct immunohistochemical techniques, stereology and confocal microscopy, we show that: i) dcx+ cells in the perilesional zone do not constitute a homogenous population and two cell types, stellate and polar cells can be distinguished according to their morphology. ii) stellate cells are mainly located in the lateral and medial vicinity of the insult and express astrocytic markers. iii) polar cells are found almost exclusively in the corpus callosum region including in the preserved deep cortical layers close to the subventricular zone . further, they do not show any colocalisation of glial markers. polar morphology and distribution suggest a migration towards the lesion.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our findings provide evidence that in mice dcx+ cells in the perilesional zone of cortical infarcts comprise a distinct cell population and the majority of cells are of glial nature.
