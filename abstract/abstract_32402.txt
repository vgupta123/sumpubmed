BACKGROUND
targeted resequencing offers a cost-effective alternative to whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing when investigating regions known to be associated with a trait or disease. there are a number of approaches to targeted resequencing, including microfluidic pcr amplification, which may be enhanced by multiplex pcr. currently, there is no open-source software that can design next-generation multiplex pcr experiments that ensures primers are unique at a genome-level and efficiently pools compatible primers.


RESULTS
we present mpd, a software package that automates the design of multiplex pcr primers for next-generation sequencing. the core of mpd is implemented in c for speed and uses a hashed genome to ensure primer uniqueness, avoids placing primers over sites of known variation, and efficiently pools compatible primers. a javascript web application  utilizing the mpd perl package provides a convenient platform for users to make designs. using a realistic set of genes identified by genome-wide association studies , we achieve 90% coverage of all exonic regions using stringent design criteria. using the first  <dig> primer pools for wet-lab validation, we sequenced ~25kb at  <dig> % completeness with a mean coverage of 300x among  <dig> samples simultaneously and identified  <dig> variants. the number and nature of variants we observe are consistent with high quality sequencing.


CONCLUSIONS
mpd can successfully design multiplex pcr experiments suitable for next-generation sequencing, and simplifies retooling targeted resequencing pipelines to focus on new targets as new genetic evidence emerges.
