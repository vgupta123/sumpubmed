BACKGROUND
the ly- <dig>  superfamily members share the ly- <dig> domain defined by distinct disulfide bonding patterns between  <dig> or  <dig> cysteine residues. they comprise membrane- and secretory-type proteins. we recently reported the gene and protein characterization of the bovine secreted protein of ly- <dig> domain  <dig> . bovine sold <dig> is expressed in trophoblast mononucleate cells  and is localized in the cotyledonary mesenchyme. here, we compared the expression and functionality of sold <dig> among the ruminants. we examined mrna expression by chorionic fibroblasts as a measure of one of the sold <dig> functions.


RESULTS
ovine and caprine sold <dig> mrnas have  <dig> bp open reading frames and encode for deduced sold <dig> proteins with  <dig> amino acids, including a 22-aa-long signal peptide at the n-terminal. both of the sold <dig> amino acid sequences have high similarities with the bovine sequence. both sold <dig> mrnas were also expressed in tmcs of cotyledons and intercotyledonary membranes. the mature sold <dig> proteins were localized in the mesenchymal villi of cotyledons after secretion. bovine, ovine and caprine sold <dig> affected gene expression in mesenchymal fibroblasts in vitro; nucleoredoxin expression was upregulated and bcl2-like  <dig> was downregulated. thus, we suggest that sold <dig> acts as a modulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis.


CONCLUSIONS
expressing cells and protein localization of sold <dig> coincided among the three ruminants. sold <dig> participated in regulating nucleoredoxin and bcl2-like  <dig> expression in chorionic fibroblasts. sold <dig> is produced specifically in the cotyledons and intercotyledonary membranes in ruminants and appears to be involved in the construction of the ruminant placenta.
