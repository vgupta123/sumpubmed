BACKGROUND
essential for mitotic growth  <dig>  is a highly conserved nucleolar protein identified in yeast to have a critical function in ribosome biogenesis. a mutation in the human emg <dig> homolog causes bowen-conradi syndrome , a developmental disorder characterized by severe growth failure and psychomotor retardation leading to death in early childhood. to begin to understand the role of emg <dig> in mammalian development, and how its deficiency could lead to bowen-conradi syndrome, we have used mouse as a model. the expression of emg <dig> during mouse development was examined and mice carrying a null mutation for emg <dig> were generated and characterized.


RESULTS
our studies indicated that emg <dig> is broadly expressed during early mouse embryonic development. however, in late embryonic stages and during postnatal development, emg <dig> exhibited specific expression patterns. to assess a developmental role for emg <dig> in vivo, we exploited a mouse gene-targeting approach. loss of emg <dig> function in mice arrested embryonic development prior to the blastocyst stage. the arrested emg1-/- embryos exhibited defects in early cell lineage-specification as well as in nucleologenesis. further, loss of p <dig>  which has been shown to rescue some phenotypes resulting from defects in ribosome biogenesis, failed to rescue the emg1-/- pre-implantation lethality.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate that emg <dig> is highly expressed during mouse embryonic development, and essential for mouse pre-implantation development. the absolute requirement for emg <dig> in early embryonic development is consistent with its essential role in yeast. further, our findings also lend support to the previous study that showed bowen-conradi syndrome results from a partial emg <dig> deficiency. a complete deficiency would not be expected to be compatible with a live birth.
