BACKGROUND
hydrophobic protein from soybean  is an  <dig> kd cysteine-rich polypeptide that causes asthma in persons allergic to soybean dust. hps is synthesized in the pod endocarp and deposited on the seed surface during development. past evidence suggests that the protein may mediate the adherence or dehiscence of endocarp tissues during maturation and affect the lustre, or glossiness of the seed surface.


RESULTS
a comparison of soybean germplasm by genomic dna blot hybridization shows that the copy number and structure of the hps locus is polymorphic among soybean cultivars and related species. changes in hps gene copy number were also detected by comparative genomic dna hybridization using cdna microarrays. the hps copy number polymorphisms co-segregated with seed lustre phenotype and hps surface protein in a cross between dull- and shiny-seeded soybeans. in soybean cultivar harosoy  <dig>  a minimum of  <dig> Â±  <dig> copies of the hps gene were estimated to be present in each haploid genome. the isolation and analysis of genomic clones indicates that the core hps locus is comprised of a tandem array of reiterated units, with each  <dig>  kb unit containing a single hps open reading frame.


CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that polymorphisms at the hps locus arise from changes in the gene copy number via gene amplification. we present a model whereby hps copy number modulates protein expression levels and seed lustre, and we suggest that gene amplification may result from selection pressures imposed on crop plants.
