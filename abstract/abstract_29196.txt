BACKGROUND
skeletal muscle differentiation is a multistep, complex pathway in which several important signaling molecules are involved. recently, micrornas , endogenous non-coding small rnas that regulate mrnas, have been proposed to be involved in skeletal muscle differentiation. in this study, we identified skeletal muscle differentiation-associated mirnas by comparing mirna expression profiles between c2c <dig> cells and wnt <dig> over-expressing c2c <dig> cells , which can spontaneously differentiate into myotubes.


RESULTS
we identified mir- <dig>  mir-133a, and mir-133b as up-regulated mirnas and mir-487b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> as down-regulated mirnas in differentiating cells. we focused on the down-regulated mirnas because their functions were largely unknown. transfection of mimics of these mirnas into c2c <dig> cells resulted in significantly reduced expression of myogenic differentiation markers, including troponin t and myosin heavy chain fast type and slow type, but did not affect the expression of the myogenic transcription factors, myod and myogenin.


CONCLUSIONS
these mirnas were characterized as new myogenic differentiation-associated mirnas which may delay late myogenic differentiation or maturation.
