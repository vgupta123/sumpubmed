BACKGROUND
using antibodies to specific protein antigens is the method of choice to assign and identify cell lineage through simultaneous analysis of surface molecules and intracellular markers. embryonic stem cell research can be benefited from using antibodies specific to transcriptional factors/markers that contribute to the "stemness" phenotype or critical for cell lineage.


RESULTS
in this report, we have developed and validated antibodies  specific to human embryonic stem cell antigens and early differentiation transcriptional factors/markers that are critical for cell differentiation into definite lineage.


CONCLUSIONS
these antibodies enable stem cell biologists to conveniently identify stem cell characteristics and to quantitatively assess differentiation.
