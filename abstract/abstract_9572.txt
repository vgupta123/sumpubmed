BACKGROUND
in the cerebellum of newborn s100b-egfp mice, we had previously noted the presence of a large population of s100b-expressing cells, which we assumed to be immature bergmann glial cells. in the present study, we have drawn on this observation to establish the precise spatio-temporal pattern of s100b gene expression in the embryonic cerebellum.


RESULTS
from e <dig>  until e <dig> , s100b was expressed in the primary radial glial scaffold involved in purkinje progenitor exit from the ventricular zone and in the sox9+ glial progenitors derived from it. during the same period coinciding with the primary phase of granule neuron precursor genesis, transient egfp expression tagged the pax6+ forerunners of granule precursors born in the cerebellar rhombic lip.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides the first characterization of s100b-expressing cell types of the embryonic mouse cerebellum in a high-resolution map. the transient activation of the s100b gene distinguishes granule neuron precursors from all other types of precursors so far identified in the rhombic lip, whereas its activation in radial glial precursors is a feature of bergmann cell gliogenesis.
