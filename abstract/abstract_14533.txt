BACKGROUND
the tumour suppressor protein p <dig> is a sequence specific dna-binding transcription regulator, which exerts its versatile roles in genome protection and apoptosis by affecting the expression of a large number of genes. in an attempt to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms by which p <dig> transcription function is regulated, we studied p <dig> interactions.


RESULTS
we identified bip <dig> , the fly homolog of taf <dig>  a histone fold and a plant homeodomain containing subunit of tfiid, as an interacting partner of drosophila melanogaster p <dig> . we detected physical interaction between the c terminus of dmp <dig> and the central region of taf <dig> both in yeast two hybrid assays and in vitro. interestingly, dmtaf <dig> can also interact with human p <dig>  and mammalian taf <dig> can bind to both dmp <dig> and human p <dig>  this evolutionarily conserved interaction is functionally significant, since elevated taf <dig> expression severely and selectively inhibits transcription activation by p <dig> in human cell lines, and it decreases the level of the p <dig> protein as well.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified taf <dig> as an evolutionarily conserved negative regulator of p <dig> transcription activation function.
