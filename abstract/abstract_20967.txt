BACKGROUND
the drosophila male specific lethal  complex contains chromatin modifying enzymes and non-coding rox rna. it paints the male x at hundreds of bands where it acetylates histone h <dig> at lysine  <dig>  this epigenetic mark increases expression from the single male x chromosome approximately twofold above what gene-specific factors produce from each female x chromosome. this equalises x-linked gene expression between the sexes. previous screens for components of dosage compensation relied on a distinctive male-specific lethal phenotype.


RESULTS
here, we report a new strategy relying upon an unusual male-specific mosaic eye pigmentation phenotype produced when the msl complex acts upon autosomal rox <dig> transgenes. screening the second chromosome identified at least five loci, two of which are previously described components of the msl complex. we focused our analysis on the modifier alleles of msl <dig> and mle . the msl <dig> lesions are not simple nulls, but rather alter the pehe domain that recruits the msl <dig> chromodomain and mof  histone acetyltransferase subunits to the complex. these mutants are compromised in their ability to recruit msl <dig> and mof, dosage compensate the x, and support long distance spreading from rox <dig> transgenes. yet, paradoxically, they were isolated because they somehow increase msl complex activity immediately around rox <dig> transgenes in combination with wild-type msl <dig> subunits.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that these diverse phenotypes arise from perturbations in assembly of msl subunits onto nascent rox transcripts. this strategy is a promising alternative route for identifying previously unknown components of the dosage compensation pathway and novel alleles of known msl proteins.
