BACKGROUND
rule-based modeling  is a powerful and increasingly popular approach to modeling cell signaling networks. however, novel visual tools are needed in order to make rbm accessible to a broad range of users, to make specification of models less error prone, and to improve workflows.


RESULTS
we introduce rulebender, a novel visualization system for the integrated visualization, modeling and simulation of rule-based intracellular biochemistry. we present the user requirements, visual paradigms, algorithms and design decisions behind rulebender, with emphasis on visual global/local model exploration and integrated execution of simulations. the support of rbm creation, debugging, and interactive visualization expedites the rbm learning process and reduces model construction time; while built-in model simulation and results with multiple linked views streamline the execution and analysis of newly created models and generated networks.


CONCLUSIONS
rulebender has been adopted as both an educational and a research tool and is available as a free open source tool at http://www.rulebender.org. a development cycle that includes close interaction with expert users allows rulebender to better serve the needs of the systems biology community.
