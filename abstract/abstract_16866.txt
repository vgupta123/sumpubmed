BACKGROUND
salt stress is a major challenge for growth and development of plants. the mangrove tree avicennia officinalis has evolved salt tolerance mechanisms such as salt secretion through specialized glands on its leaves. although a number of structural studies on salt glands have been done, the molecular mechanism of salt secretion is not clearly understood. also, studies to identify salt gland-specific genes in mangroves have been scarce.


RESULTS
by subtractive hybridization  of cdna from salt gland-rich cell layers  with mesophyll tissues as the driver, several expressed sequence tags  were identified. the major classes of ests identified include those known to be involved in regulating metabolic processes , stress response , transcription , signal transduction  and transport functions . a visual interactive map generated based on predicted functional gene interactions of the identified ests suggested altered activities of hydrolase, transmembrane transport and kinases. quantitative real-time pcr  was carried out to validate the expression specificity of the ests identified by sh. a dehydrin gene was chosen for further experimental analysis, because it is significantly highly expressed in salt gland cells, and dehydrins are known to be involved in stress remediation in other plants. full-length avicennia officinalis dehydrin <dig>  cdna was obtained by rapid amplification of cdna ends. phylogenetic analysis and further characterization of this gene suggested that aodhn <dig> belongs to group ii late embryogenesis abundant proteins. qrt-pcr analysis of avicennia showed up-regulation of aodhn <dig> in response to salt and drought treatments. furthermore, some functional insights were obtained by growing e. coli cells expressing aodhn <dig>  growth of e. coli cells expressing aodhn <dig> was significantly higher than that of the control cells without aodhn <dig> under salinity and drought stresses, suggesting that the mangrove dehydrin protein helps to mitigate the abiotic stresses.


CONCLUSIONS
thirty-four ests were identified to be enriched in salt gland-rich tissues of a. officinalis leaves. qrt-pcr analysis showed that  <dig> of these were specifically enriched in the salt gland-rich tissues. our data suggest that one of the selected genes, namely, aodhn <dig> plays an important role to mitigate salt and drought stress responses.
