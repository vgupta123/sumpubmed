BACKGROUND
the potato genome sequence derived from the solanum tuberosum group phureja clone dm1- <dig>  <dig> r <dig> provides unparalleled insight into the genome composition and organisation of this important crop. a key class of genes that comprises the vast majority of plant resistance  genes contains a nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat domain, and is collectively known as nb-lrrs.


RESULTS
as part of an effort to accelerate the process of functional r gene isolation, we performed an amino acid motif based search of the annotated potato genome and identified  <dig> nb-lrr type genes among the ~ <dig>  potato gene models. of the predicted genes,  <dig> contain an n-terminal toll/interleukin  <dig> receptor -like domain, and  <dig> of the remaining  <dig> non-tir genes contain an n-terminal coiled-coil  domain. physical map positions were established for  <dig> predicted nb-lrr genes across all  <dig> potato chromosomes. the majority of nb-lrrs are physically organised within  <dig> identified clusters, of which  <dig> are homogeneous in that they contain nb-lrrs derived from a recent common ancestor.


CONCLUSIONS
by establishing the phylogenetic and positional relationship of potato nb-lrrs, our analysis offers significant insight into the evolution of potato r genes. furthermore, the data provide a blueprint for future efforts to identify and more rapidly clone functional nb-lrr genes from solanum species.
