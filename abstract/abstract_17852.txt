BACKGROUND
orange-spotted grouper  with protogynous hermaphroditic features are one of the most economically important aquaculture species in taiwan. however, larvae stage grouper are susceptible to infection by the bacterial pathogen vibrio alginolyticus. to better understand the molecular mechanisms of the immune response to v. alginolyticus in epinephelus coioides larvae, we used high-throughput deep sequencing technology to study the effect of infection on gene expression.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads were assembled, consisting of  <dig> , <dig>  nucleotides; these were further assembled into  <dig>  contigs with a mean length of 372 bp. gene ontology  analysis of the transcriptome revealed  <dig> cellular component subcategories,  <dig> molecular function subcategories, and  <dig> biological process subcategories . a total of  <dig> epinephelus coioides genes were mapped to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ;  <dig> differentially expressed genes  were subsequently identified, in  <dig> categories . vibrio infection affected the expression of genes involved in complementation, coagulation cascades, pathogen  infection, phagosome activity, antigen processing, and the antigen presentation pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the complement pathway of innate immunity and the hepicidin antimicrobial peptide may play important roles in the defense of epinephelus coioides larvae against v. alginolyticus, and the immune response may activate at 4 h after bacterial infection. these results implicate the complement pathway signal pathway in immunity during v. alginolyticus infection at early developmental stages, enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the immune response to vibrio infection in epinephelus coioides.
