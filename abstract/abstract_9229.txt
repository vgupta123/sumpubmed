BACKGROUND
glutathione transferases  belong to the family of phase ii detoxification enzymes. gsts catalyze the conjugation of glutathione to different endogenous and exogenous electrophilic compounds. over-expression of gsts was demonstrated in a number of different human cancer cells. it has been found that the resistance to many anticancer chemotherapeutics is directly correlated with the over-expression of gsts. therefore, it appears to be important to find new gst inhibitors to prevent the resistance of cells to anticancer drugs. in order to search for glutathione transferase  inhibitors, a novel method was designed.


RESULTS
our results showed that two fragments of gst, named f <dig> peptide  and f <dig> peptide , can significantly inhibit the gst activity. when these two fragments were compared with several known potent gst inhibitors, the order of inhibition efficiency  and glutathione as substrates) was determined as follows: tannic acid > cibacron blue > f <dig> peptide > hematin > f <dig> peptide > ethacrynic acid. moreover, the f <dig> peptide appeared to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of the gst-catalyzed reaction, while the f <dig> peptide was determined as a competitive inhibitor of this reaction.


CONCLUSIONS
it appears that the f <dig> peptide can be used as a new potent specific gst inhibitor. it is proposed that the novel method, described in this report, might be useful for screening the inhibitors of not only gst but also other enzymes.
