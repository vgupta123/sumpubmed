BACKGROUND
micrornas  play a key role in regulating various biological processes such as participating in the post-transcriptional pathway and affecting the stability and/or the translation of mrna. current methods have extracted feature information at different levels, among which the characteristic stem-loop structure makes the greatest contribution to the prediction of putative mirna precursor . we find that none of these features alone is capable of identifying new pre-mirna accurately.


RESULTS
in the present work, a pre-mirna stem-loop secondary structure is translated to a network, which provides a novel perspective for its structural analysis. network parameters are used to construct prediction model, achieving an area under the receiver operating curves  value of  <dig> . moreover, by repeating the same method on two independent datasets, accuracies of  <dig>  and  <dig>  are achieved, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
network parameters effectively characterize pre-mirna secondary structure, which improves our prediction model in both prediction ability and computation efficiency. additionally, as a complement to feature extraction methods in previous studies, these multifaceted features can reflect natural properties of mirnas and be used for comprehensive and systematic analysis on mirna.
