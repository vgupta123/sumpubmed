BACKGROUND
protease-activated receptors , members of g-protein-coupled receptors, are activated by proteolytic activity of various proteases. activation of par <dig> and par <dig> triggers innate immune responses in human oral keratinocytes , but the signaling pathways downstream of par activation in hoks have not been clearly defined. in this study, we aimed to determine if par1- and par2-mediated signaling differs in the induction of innate immune markers cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> via erk, p <dig> and pi3k/akt.


RESULTS
our data show the induction of innate immunity by par <dig> requires both p <dig> and erk map kinases, while par <dig> prominently signals via p <dig>  however, inhibition of pi3k enhances expression of innate immune markers predominantly via suppressing p <dig> phosphorylation signaled by par activation.


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that proteases mediating par <dig> and par <dig> activation differentially signal via map kinase cascades. in addition, the production of chemokines induced by par <dig> and par <dig> is suppressed by pi3k/akt, thus keeping the innate immune responses of hok in balance. the results of our study provide a novel insight into signaling pathways involved in par activation.
