BACKGROUND
a number of recent studies have shown that the pattern of mitochondrial dna variation and evolution is at odds with a neutral equilibrium model. theory has suggested that selection on mitonuclear genotypes can act to maintain stable mitonuclear polymorphism within populations. however, this effect largely relies upon selection being either sex-specific or frequency dependent. here, we use mitonuclear introgression lines to assess differences in a series of key life-history traits  in drosophila subobscura fruit flies carrying one of three different sympatric mtdna haplotypes.


RESULTS
we found functional differences between these sympatric mtdna haplotypes, but these effects were contingent upon the nuclear genome with which they were co-expressed. further, we demonstrate a significant mitonuclear genetic effect on adult sex ratio, as well as a sex × mtdna × nudna interaction for adult longevity.


CONCLUSIONS
the observed effects suggest that sex specific mitonuclear selection contributes to the maintenance of mtdna polymorphism and to mitonuclear linkage disequilibrium in this model system.
