BACKGROUND
infections caused by extended spectrum beta-lactamases -producing bacteria have been emerging worldwide and the majority of esbl-producing e. coli strains are isolated from patients with urinary tracts infections. the purpose of this study was to compare the host-response mechanisms in human polymorphonucleated leukocytes  and renal epithelial cells when stimulated by esbl- or non-esbl-producing uropathogenic e. coli  isolates. the host-pathogen interaction of these esbl-producing strains in the urinary tract is not well studied.


RESULTS
the ability of esbl strains to evoke ros-production from pmn cells was significantly higher than that of the non-esbl strains. the growth of esbl strains was slightly suppressed in the presence of pmn compared to non-esbl strains after 30 min and 2 h, but the opposite was observed after  <dig> and 6 h. the number of migrating pmn was significantly higher in response to esbl strains compared to non-esbl strains. stimulation of a <dig> cells with esbl strains elicited lower production of il- <dig> and il- <dig> compared to non-esbl strains.


CONCLUSIONS
significant differences in host-response mechanisms were identified when host cells were stimulated by esbl- or non-esbl producing strains. the obtained results on the early interactions of esbl-producing strains with the host immune system may provide valuable information for management of these infections.
