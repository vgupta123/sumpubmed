BACKGROUND
human mesenchymal stromal cells  are multipotent cells with potential therapeutic value. owing to their osteogenic capability, mscs may be clinically applied for facilitating osseointegration in dental implants or orthopedic repair of bony defect. however, whether wound infection or oral microflora may interfere with the growth and osteogenic differentiation of human mscs remains unknown. this study investigated whether proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of mscs would be affected by potent gram-positive and gram-negative derived bacterial toxins commonly found in human settings.


RESULTS
we selected lipopolysaccharide  from escherichia coli and lipoteichoic acid  from streptococcus pyogenes as our toxins of choice. our findings showed both lps and lta did not affect msc proliferation, but prolonged lps challenge upregulated the osteogenic differentiation of mscs, as assessed by alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition. because toll-like receptors , in particularly tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  are important for the cellular responsiveness to lps and lta respectively, we evaluated their expression profiles serially from mscs to osteoblasts by quantitative pcr. we found that during osteogenic differentiation, msc-derived osteoprogenitors gradually expressed tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> by day  <dig>  but under prolonged incubation with lps, msc-derived osteoprogenitors had reduced tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> gene expression. this peculiar response to lps suggests a possible adaptive mechanism when mscs are subjected to continuous exposure with bacteria.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our findings support the potential of using human mscs as a biological graft, even under a bacterial toxin-rich environment.
