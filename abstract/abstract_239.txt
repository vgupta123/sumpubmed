BACKGROUND
interferon  alpha conjugation to polyethylene glycol  results in a better pharmacokinetic profile and efficacy. the aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety properties of a new, locally developed, 40-kda peg-ifn alpha-2b preparation with a reference, commercially available peg-ifn alpha-2a in healthy male volunteers.

methods
a randomized, crossover, double-blind study with a 3-weeks washout period, was done. a single  <dig> micrograms peg-ifn alpha- <dig> dose was administered subcutaneously in both groups. sixteen apparently healthy male subjects were included. serum peg-ifn concentration was measured during  <dig> hours by an enzyme immunoassay . other clinical and laboratory variables were used as pharmacodynamic and safety criteria.


RESULTS
the pharmacokinetic comparison by eia yielded a high similitude between the formulations. in spite of a high subject variability, the parameters' mean were very close : auc:  <dig> vs.  <dig> pg.h/ml; cmax:  <dig> vs.  <dig> pg/ml; tmax:  <dig> vs.  <dig> h; half-life :  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  h; terminal elimination rate :  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  h-1; mean residence time :  <dig> vs.  <dig> h for reference and study preparations, respectively. there were no significant differences with respect to the pharmacodynamic variables either: serum neopterin and beta- <dig> microglobulin levels, stimulation of 2'5' oligoadenylate synthetase expression, and serum ifn antiviral activity. a strong spearman's rank order correlation  between the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic concentration-time curves was observed. both products caused similar leukocyte counts diminution and had similar safety profiles. the most frequent adverse reactions were leukopenia, fever, thrombocytopenia, transaminases increase and asthenia, mostly mild.


CONCLUSIONS
both formulations are fully comparable from the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profiles. efficacy trials can be carried out to confirm clinical similarity.
