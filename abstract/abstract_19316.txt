BACKGROUND
the sepals, petals and stamens of arabidopsis flowers detach via abscission zones formed at their boundaries with the underlying receptacle. the asymmetric leaves <dig>  myb transcription factor plays a critical role in setting boundaries between newly formed leaf primordia and the shoot meristem. by repressing expression of a set of knotted1-like homeodomain  genes from developing leaf primordia, as <dig> and its partner asymmetric leaves <dig> allow the patterning and differentiation of leaves to proceed. here we show a unique role for as <dig> in establishing the positions of the sepal and petal abscission zones in arabidopsis flowers.


RESULTS
in as <dig> mutant flowers, the sepal abscission zones are displaced into inverted v-shaped positions, leaving behind triangular stubs of tissue when the organs abscise. movement of the petal abscission zones is also apparent. abscission of the medial sepals is delayed in as <dig> flowers; loss of chlorophyll in the senescing sepals contrasts with proximal zones that remain green. as <dig> has previously been shown to restrict expression of the knox gene, brevipedicellus , from the sepals. we show here that loss of bp activity in as <dig> flowers is sufficient to restore the positions of the sepal and petal abscission zones, the sepal-receptacle boundary of the medial sepals and the timing of their abscission.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that as <dig> activity is critical for the proper placement of the floral organ abscission zones, and influences the timing of organ shedding.
