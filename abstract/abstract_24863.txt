BACKGROUND
diguanylate cyclases  regulate biofilm formation and motility in bacteria by synthesizing the second messenger cyclic di-gmp  in response to environmental stimuli. dgc enzymatic activity is believed to be dependent on the presence of a ggef active site motif, however approximately 25% of known dgcs contain a degenerate active site. the vibrio cholerae protein vca <dig> contains an agdef active site and is presumed to be an inactive dgc.


RESULTS
ectopic expression of vca <dig> in v. cholerae causes a 3-fold reduction in flagellar-based motility. additionally, an rxxd allosteric inhibition mutant of vca <dig> strongly inhibited motility and stimulated biofilm formation. this activity was lost when the active site of vca <dig> was mutated to agdaf, suggesting that vca <dig> synthesizes c-di-gmp. in support of this, ectopic expression of vca <dig> and vca <dig> containing a mutation in its rxxd motif significantly increased the intracellular c-di-gmp levels in v. cholerae and escherichia coli. furthermore, we found that purified vca <dig> was able to synthesize c-di-gmp in vitro. systematic mutation of the first amino acid in the agdef motif of vca <dig> revealed that glycine, methionine, and histidine also produced an active dgc capable of inhibiting motility and increasing the intracellular concentration of c-di-gmp in v. cholerae.


CONCLUSIONS
based on these results, we conclude that vca <dig> is capable of c-di-gmp synthesis and that the first amino acid of the ggef motif is more tolerant of substitutions than currently appreciated.
