BACKGROUND
the lung of patients with cystic fibrosis  is particularly sensitive to pseudomonas aeruginosa. this bacterium plays an important role in the poor outcome of cf patients. during the disease progress, first acquisition of p. aeruginosa is the key-step in the management of cf patients. quantitative pcr  offers an opportunity to detect earlier the first acquisition of p. aeruginosa by cf patients. given the lack of a validated protocol, our goal was to find an optimal molecular protocol for detection of p. aeruginosa in cf patients.

methods
we compared two formerly described qpcr formats in early detection of p. aeruginosa in cf sputum samples: a qpcr targeting oprl gene, and a multiplex pcr targeting gyrb and ecfx genes.


RESULTS
tested in vitro on a large panel of p. aeruginosa isolates and others gram-negative bacilli, oprl qpcr exhibited a better sensitivity , whereas the gyrb/ecfx qpcr exhibited a better specificity . these results were validated ex vivo on  <dig> cf sputum samples positive for p. aeruginosa in culture. ex vivo assays revealed that qpcr detected  <dig> times more bacterial cells than culture-based method did.


CONCLUSIONS
based on these results, we proposed a reference molecular protocol combining the two qpcrs, which offers a sensitivity of 100% with a threshold of 10Â cfu/ml and a specificity of 100%. this combined qpcr-based protocol can be adapted and used for other future prospective studies.
