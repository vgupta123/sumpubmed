BACKGROUND
microarray data analysis is notorious for involving a huge number of genes compared to a relatively small number of samples. gene selection is to detect the most significantly differentially expressed genes under different conditions, and it has been a central research focus. in general, a better gene selection method can improve the performance of classification significantly. one of the difficulties in gene selection is that the numbers of samples under different conditions vary a lot.


RESULTS
two novel gene selection methods are proposed in this paper, which are not affected by the unbalanced sample class sizes and do not assume any explicit statistical model on the gene expression values. they were evaluated on eight publicly available microarray datasets, using leave-one-out cross-validation and 5-fold cross-validation. the performance is measured by the classification accuracies using the top ranked genes based on the training datasets.


CONCLUSIONS
the experimental results showed that the proposed gene selection methods are efficient, effective, and robust in identifying differentially expressed genes. adopting the existing svm-based and knn-based classifiers, the selected genes by our proposed methods in general give more accurate classification results, typically when the sample class sizes in the training dataset are unbalanced.
