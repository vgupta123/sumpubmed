BACKGROUND
dab <dig>  one of two mammalian orthologs of drosophila disabled, has been shown to be involved in cell positioning and formation of visceral endoderm during mouse embryogenesis, but its role in neuronal development is not yet fully understood. in this report, we have examined the localization of the dab <dig> protein in the mouse embryonic central nervous system  at different developmental stages.


RESULTS
dab <dig> protein was transiently expressed in rhombomeres  <dig> and  <dig> of the developing hindbrain between e <dig>  and e <dig> , and in the floor plate of the neural tube from e <dig>  to e <dig> , following which it was no longer detectable within these regions. dab <dig> protein was also identified within circumventricular organs including the choroid plexus, subcommissural organ and pineal gland during their early development. while dab <dig> was still strongly expressed in the adult choroid plexus, immunoreactivity within the subcommissural organ and pineal gland was lost after birth. in addition, dab <dig> was transiently expressed within a subpopulation of iba1-positive mononuclear phagocytes  within the neural tube from e <dig>  and was lost by e <dig> . dab <dig> was separately localized to iba <dig> positive cells from e <dig>  and subsequently to f4/ <dig> positive cells  positioned outside the neural tube from e <dig>  onwards, implicating dab <dig> expression in early cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage. dab <dig> did not co-localize with the pan-neuronal marker pgp <dig>  at any developmental stage, suggesting that dab <dig> positive cells in the developing cns are unlikely to be differentiating neurons.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study to demonstrate the dynamic spatiotemporal expression of dab <dig> protein within the cns during development.
