BACKGROUND
the atp-binding cassette  functional superfamily includes integral transmembrane exporters that have evolved three times independently, forming three families termed abc <dig>  abc <dig> and abc <dig>  upon which monophyletic atpases have been superimposed for energy-coupling purposes . the goal of the work reported in this communication was to understand how the integral membrane constituents of abc uptake transporters with different numbers of predicted or established transmembrane segments  evolved. in a few cases, high resolution 3-dimensional structures were available, and in these cases, their structures plus primary sequence analyses allowed us to predict evolutionary pathways of origin.


RESULTS
all of the  <dig> currently recognized families of abc uptake proteins except for one  were shown to be homologous using quantitative statistical methods. these methods involved using established programs that compare native protein sequences with each other, after having compared each sequence with thousands of its own shuffled sequences, to gain evidence for homology. topological analyses suggested that these porters contain numbers of tmss ranging from four or five to twenty. intragenic duplication events occurred multiple times during the evolution of these porters. they originated from a simple primordial protein containing  <dig> tmss which duplicated to  <dig> tmss, and then produced porters of the various topologies via insertions, deletions and further duplications. except for family  <dig> which proved to be related to abc <dig> exporters, they are all related to members of the previously identified abc <dig> exporter family. duplications that occurred in addition to the primordial 3 →  <dig> duplication included 5 →  <dig>  6 →  <dig> and 10 →  <dig> tmss. in one case, protein topologies were uncertain as different programs gave discrepant predictions. it could not be concluded with certainty whether a  <dig> tms ancestral protein or a  <dig> tms ancestral protein duplicated to give an  <dig> or a  <dig> tms protein. evidence is presented suggesting but not proving that the 2tms repeat unit in abc <dig> porters derived from the two central tmss of abc <dig> porters. these results provide structural information and plausible evolutionary pathways for the appearance of most integral membrane constituents of abc uptake transport systems.


CONCLUSIONS
almost all integral membrane uptake porters of the abc superfamily belong to the abc <dig> family, previously established for exporters. most of these proteins can have  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> tmss per polypeptide chain. evolutionary pathways for their appearance are proposed.
