BACKGROUND
fiz <dig>  is a broadly expressed protein of unknown function. we reported previously that in the mammalian retina, fiz <dig> interacts with nrl , an essential transcriptional activator of rod photoreceptor-specific genes. the concentration of fiz <dig> in the retina increases during photoreceptor terminal maturation, when two key transcription factors nrl and crx  become detectable on the promoters of photoreceptor-specific genes . to determine if fiz <dig> is involved in regulating crx-mediated transcriptional activation, we examined fiz <dig> subcellular location in mouse neural retina, its ability to interact with crx, and its association with crx/nrl target genes.


RESULTS
fiz <dig> is present in the nucleus of adult photoreceptors as well as other retinal neurons as shown by transmission electron microscopy with nano-gold labeling. fiz <dig> and crx were co-precipitated from retinal nuclear extracts with antibodies to either protein. chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays revealed that fiz <dig> is part of the protein complex on several rod and cone gene promoters, within photoreceptor cells of the mouse retina. fiz <dig> complexes with crx or nrl on known nrl- and crx-responsive elements, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays with fiz <dig> antibody. fiz <dig> can directly bind to crx, as demonstrated using yeast two-hybrid and gst pull-down assays. co-transfection assays demonstrated that fiz <dig> increases crx-mediated activation of opsin test promoters. quantitative chip analysis revealed an increased association of fiz <dig> with the rhodopsin promoter in adult  neural retina versus immature  neural retina. the quantity of transcriptionally active rna polymerase-ii within the rhodopsin gene  was significantly increased in the adult neural retina, compared to the immature retina.


CONCLUSIONS
fiz <dig> directly interacts with crx to enhance crx's transactivation activity for target genes. developmentally, in neural retina tissue, the increased association of fiz <dig> with crx target genes corresponds to an increased association of transcriptionally active pol-ii within the rho gene. together with previous findings, our results suggest that fiz <dig> may act as a transcriptional co-regulator of photoreceptor-specific genes, recruited by at least two photoreceptor-specific transcription factors, crx and nrl. further studies are underway to elucidate the exact role of fiz <dig> in photoreceptor gene expression, development and maintenance.
