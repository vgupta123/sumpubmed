BACKGROUND
maize  is an important model crop for transgenic studies. however, genetic transformation of maize requires embryonic calli derived from immature embryo, and the impact of utilizing tissue culture methods on the maize epigenome is poorly understood. here, we generated whole-genome medip-seq data examining dna methylation in dedifferentiated and normal immature maize embryos.


RESULTS
we observed that most of the dedifferentiated embryos exhibited a methylation increase compared to normal embryos. increased methylation at promoters was associated with down-regulated protein-coding gene expression; however, the correlation was not strong. analysis of the callus and immature embryos indicated that the methylation increase was induced during induction of embryonic callus, suggesting phenotypic consequences may be caused by perturbations in genomic dna methylation levels. the correlation between the 21-24nt small rnas and dna methylation regions were investigated but only a statistically significant correlation for 24nt small rnas was observed.


CONCLUSIONS
these data extend the significance of epigenetic changes during maize embryo callus formation, and the methylation changes might explain some of the observed embryonic callus variation in callus formation.
