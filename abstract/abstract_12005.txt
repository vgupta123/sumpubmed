BACKGROUND
boswellic acids are pentacyclic triterpenes, which are produced in plants belonging to the genus boswellia. boswellic acids appear in the resin exudates of the plant and it makes up 25-35% of the resin. β-boswellic acid, 11-keto-β-boswellic acid and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid have been implicated in apoptosis of cancer cells, particularly that of brain tumors and cells affected by leukemia or colon cancer. these molecules are also associated with potent antimicrobial activities. the present study describes the antimicrobial activities of boswellic acid molecules against  <dig> pathogenic bacterial isolates including atcc strains. acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid , which exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity, was further evaluated in time kill studies, postantibiotic effect  and biofilm susceptibility assay. the mechanism of action of akba was investigated by propidium iodide uptake, leakage of  <dig> and  <dig> nm absorbing material assays.


RESULTS
akba was found to be the most active compound showing an mic range of 2- <dig> μg/ml against the entire gram positive bacterial pathogens tested. it exhibited concentration dependent killing of staphylococcus aureus atcc  <dig> up to  <dig> × mic and also demonstrated postantibiotic effect  of  <dig>  h at  <dig> × mic. furthermore, akba inhibited the formation of biofilms generated by s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and also reduced the preformed biofilms by these bacteria. increased uptake of propidium iodide and leakage of  <dig> and  <dig> nm absorbing material by akba treated cells of s aureus indicating that the antibacterial mode of action of akba probably occurred via disruption of microbial membrane structure.


CONCLUSIONS
this study supported the potential use of akba in treating s. aureus infections. akba can be further exploited to evolve potential lead compounds in the discovery of new anti-gram-positive and anti-biofilm agents.
