BACKGROUND
chaining is a major problem in constructing gene families.


RESULTS
we define a new kind of cluster on graphs with strong and weak edges: soft cliques with backbones . this differs from other definitions in how it controls the "chaining effect", by ensuring clusters satisfy a tolerant edge density criterion that takes into account cluster size. we implement algorithms for decomposing a graph of similarities into scwibs. we compare examples of output from scwib and the markov cluster algorithm , and also compare some curated arabidopsis thaliana gene families with the results of automatic clustering. we apply our method to  <dig> published angiosperm genomes with annotation, and discover that amborella trichopoda is distinct from all the others in having substantially and systematically smaller proportions of moderate- and large-size gene families.


CONCLUSIONS
we offer several possible evolutionary explanations for this result.
