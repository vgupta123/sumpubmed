BACKGROUND
neurite growth can be elicited by growth factors and interactions with extracellular matrix molecules like laminin. among the targets of the signalling pathways activated by these stimuli are cytoskeletal elements, such as actin, tubulin and neurofilaments. the cytoskeleton can also be modulated by other proteins, such as the small heat shock protein hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> interacts with actin and tubulin in non-neuronal cells and while it has been suggested to play a role in the response of some neurons to injury, there have been no direct studies of its contribution to axonal regeneration.


RESULTS
we have investigated neurite initiation and process extension using cultures of adult dorsal root ganglion  sensory neurons and a laminin stimulation paradigm. employing confocal microscopy and biochemical analyses we have examined localization of hsp <dig> at early and later stages of neurite growth. our results show that hsp <dig> is colocalized with actin and tubulin in lamellopodia, filopodia, focal contacts and mature neurites and growth cones. disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin d results in aberrant neurite initiation and extension, effects which may be attributable to alterations in actin polymerization states. inhibition of hsp <dig> phosphorylation in our cultures results in an atypical growth pattern that may be attributable to an effect of phsp <dig> on the stability of the actin cytoskeleton.


CONCLUSIONS
we observed colocalization of the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of hsp <dig> with actin and tubulin in both very early and later stages of neurite growth from cultured adult drg neurons. the colocalization of hsp <dig> and phsp <dig> with actin in lamellopodia and focal contacts at early stages of neurite growth, and in processes, branch points and growth cones at later stages, suggests that hsp <dig> may play a role in neuritogenesis and subsequent neurite extension, and potentially in the patterning of this growth. hsp <dig> has been reported to play a key role in modulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics as an actin-capping protein in non-neuronal cells. our results suggest that this may also be the case in neurons and support a role for hsp <dig> in neurite outgrowth via its phosphorylation state-dependent interactions with actin.
