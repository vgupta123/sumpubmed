BACKGROUND
the serine threonine kinase pim- <dig> has documented roles in hematopoietic progenitor and b cell precursor proliferation and survival. pim- <dig> is a molecular target of the transcription factor hoxa <dig>  previous studies showed that pim- <dig> deficiency phenocopied the hematopoietic progenitor defect in hoxa9-/- mice and forced expression of pim- <dig> normalized the in vitro proliferation defect inherent to hoxa9-/- hematopoietic progenitors. pim- <dig> is induced by cytokine signaling, including the early lymphoid/b lineage regulators flt <dig> and il- <dig>  and expression levels were shown to influence the size of the b cell compartment in bone marrow .


RESULTS
in this study, we sought to determine if transgenic expression of pim- <dig>  driven by the immunoglobulin enhancer, eμ, was sufficient to rescue the lymphoid/b cell precursor defect in hoxa <dig> or flt3-ligand  deficient mice. unexpectedly, expression of eμ − pim <dig> exacerbated lymphoid progenitor deficiencies in flt3l-/-, and to a lesser extent, hoxa9-/- mice. furthermore, eμ − pim <dig> expression alone reduced early myeloid and lymphoid, but not erythroid, progenitors. in contrast, pim- <dig> deficiency had no significant effect on early lymphoid/b cell development through the pre-pro-b cell stage, but caused a significant reduction in igm− b cell precursors. importantly, loss of pim- <dig> did not phenocopy hoxa9- or flt3l-deficiency on the lymphoid/early b cell progenitor pools.


CONCLUSIONS
these experimental findings demonstrate that pim- <dig> overexpression has developmental-stage-specific effects on b lymphopoiesis and myelopoiesis. importantly, these suggest that pim- <dig> deficiency does not contribute significantly to the early lymphoid/b cell developmental deficiency in hoxa9-/- or flt3l-/- mice.
