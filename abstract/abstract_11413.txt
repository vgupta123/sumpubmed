BACKGROUND
interest in equine gastric ulcer syndrome  has recently increased in part due to a growing awareness of the differences between squamous and glandular disease. the pathophysiology and epidemiology of squamous and glandular disease are different and recently it has been shown that the response of glandular gastric ulceration to monotherapy with omeprazole is poor. given these differences it has been recommended that specific treatment guidelines be formulated for equine glandular disease and that adjunctive therapies be investigated. along these lines it has been suggested that the addition of antimicrobials may enhance healing. the objective of this study was to investigate whether the addition of trimethoprim-sulphadimidine to omeprazole therapy would result in superior healing of naturally occurring equine glandular ulceration compared with omeprazole monotherapy.


RESULTS
combination therapy of omeprazole plus trimethoprim-sulphadimidine could not be demonstrated to be superior to omeprazole monotherapy. healing of the glandular mucosa was observed in 7/ <dig>  and 3/ <dig>  of horses in the tmps and omep groups, respectively . improvement of the glandular mucosa was observed in 12/ <dig>  and 9/ <dig>  of horses in the tmps and omep groups, respectively .


CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study do not support the addition of trimethoprim-sulphadimidine to therapeutic protocols for equine glandular ulceration. several limitations were present in the study and the use of antimicrobials as an adjunctive treatment warrants further investigation. however, given the potential deleterious consequences associated with the indiscriminate use of antimicrobials, the inclusion of antimicrobials in treatment regimes for egus is not justified until their efficacy is further validated.
