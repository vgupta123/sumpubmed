BACKGROUND
the equine infection anemia virus  p <dig> gag protein contains the late  domain required for efficient virus release of nascent virions from the cell membrane of infected cell.


RESULTS
in the present study the p <dig> protein and n- and c-terminal fragments  were chemically synthesized and used for structural analyses. circular dichroism and 1h-nmr spectroscopy provide the first molecular insight into the secondary structure and folding of this 51-amino acid protein under different solution conditions. qualitative 1h-chemical shift and noe data indicate that in a pure aqueous environment p <dig> favors an unstructured state. in its most structured state under hydrophobic conditions, p <dig> adopts a stable helical structure within the c-terminus. quantitative noe data further revealed that this Î±-helix extends from ser- <dig> to ser- <dig>  while the n-terminal residues remain unstructured. the structural elements identified for p <dig> differ substantially from that of the functional homologous hiv- <dig> p <dig> protein.


CONCLUSIONS
these structural differences are discussed in the context of the different types of l-domains regulating distinct cellular pathways in virus budding. eiav p <dig> mediates virus release by recruiting the alg2-interacting protein x  via the ypdl-motif to the site of virus budding, the counterpart of the ypxnl-motif found in p <dig>  however, p <dig> contains an additional ptap l-domain that promotes hiv- <dig> release by binding to the tumor susceptibility gene  <dig> . the notion that structures found in p <dig> differ form that of p <dig> further support the idea that different mechanisms regulate binding of alix to primary versus secondary l-domains types.
