BACKGROUND
substantial contribution to phenotypic diversity is accounted for by copy number variants . in human, as well as other species, the effect of cnvs range from benign to directly disease-causing which motivates the continued investigations of cnvs. previous canine genome-wide screenings for cnvs have been performed using high-resolution comparative genomic hybridisation arrays which have contributed with a detailed catalogue of cnvs. here, we present the first cnv investigation in dogs based on the recently reported caninehd 170 k genotyping array. the hitherto largest dataset in canine cnv discovery was assessed,  <dig> dogs from  <dig> different breeds, enabling identification of novel cnvs and a thorough characterisation of breed-specific cnvs.


RESULTS
a stringent procedure identified  <dig> cnv regions with the smallest size of 38 kb and of the  <dig> cnv regions,  <dig> overlapped  <dig> annotated genes. a total of  <dig> novel cnv regions were found containing  <dig> genes. furthermore,  <dig> breed specific cnv regions were identified of which  <dig> were novel and some of them overlapped putative disease susceptibility genes. in addition, the human ortholog of  <dig> canine copy number variable genes identified herein has been previously suggested to be dosage-sensitive in human.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study evaluated the performance of the caninehd in detecting cnvs and extends the current catalogue of canine cnv regions with several dozens of novel cnv regions. these novel cnv regions, which harbour candidate genes that possibly contribute to phenotypic variation in dogs or to disease-susceptibility, are a rich resource for future investigations.
