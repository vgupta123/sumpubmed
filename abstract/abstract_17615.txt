BACKGROUND
escherichia coli is the most predominant gram-negative bacterial pathogen associated with neonatal meningitis. previous studies indicated that the prototypic neonatal meningitis e. coli  strain rs <dig>  harbors one large plasmid. objectives of the present study were to analyze the complete nucleotide sequence of this large plasmid  and its contribution to nmec pathogenesis using in vitro and in vivo models of neonatal meningitis.


RESULTS
the plasmid is  <dig>  bp in size, belongs to the incompatibility group fib/iia , and contains a genetic load region that encodes several virulence and fitness traits such as enterotoxicity, iron acquisition and copper tolerance. the nucleotide sequence of prs <dig> showed a 41- 46% similarity to other neonatal meningitis-causing e. coli  plasmids and remarkable nucleotide sequence similarity  to large virulence plasmids of e. coli associated with acute cystitis. some genes located on prs <dig> were overly represented by nmec strains compared to fecal e. coli isolated from healthy individuals. the plasmid-cured strain was significantly attenuated relative to the rs <dig> wild-type strain as determined in vitro by invasion potential to human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells and in vivo by mortalities, histopathological lesions in the brain tissue, and bacterial recovery from the cerebrospinal fluid of infected rat pups.


CONCLUSIONS
the prs <dig> is an incfib/iia plasmid which shares a remarkable nucleotide sequence similarity to large plasmids of e. coli associated with cystitis. both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that prs <dig> plays an important role in nmec pathogenesis.
