BACKGROUND
with thousands of fungal genomes being sequenced, each genome containing up to  <dig> secondary metabolite  clusters 30–80 kb in size, breakthrough techniques are needed to characterize this sm wealth.


RESULTS
here we describe a novel system-level methodology for unbiased cloning of intact large sm clusters from a single fungal genome for one-step transformation and expression in a model host. all  <dig> intact sm clusters from aspergillus terreus were individually captured in self-replicating fungal artificial chromosomes  containing both the e. coli f replicon and an aspergillus autonomously replicating sequence . candidate facs were successfully shuttled between e. coli and the heterologous expression host a. nidulans. as proof-of-concept, an a. nidulans fac strain was characterized in a novel liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry  and data analysis pipeline, leading to the discovery of the a. terreus astechrome biosynthetic machinery.


CONCLUSIONS
the method we present can be used to capture the entire set of intact sm gene clusters and/or pathways from fungal species for heterologous expression in a. nidulans and natural product discovery.
