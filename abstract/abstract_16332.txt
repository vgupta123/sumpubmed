BACKGROUND
the purpose of this study was to determine intravenous , intramuscular  and oral  fm pk in mature swine. appropriate pain management for lameness in swine is a critical control point for veterinarians and producers, but science-based guidance on optimal housing, management and treatment of lameness is deficient. six mature swine  were administered an iv, im, or po dose of flunixin meglumine at a target dose of  <dig>  mg/kg in a cross-over design with a 10 day washout period between treatments. plasma samples collected up to 48 hours post-administration were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry  followed by non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis.


RESULTS
no adverse effects were observed with flunixin meglumine administration for all routes. flunixin meglumine was administered at an actual mean dose of  <dig>  mg/kg  iv, im and po. a mean peak plasma concentration  for im and po administration was 3748 ng/ml  and 946 ng/ml , respectively. tmax was recorded at  <dig>  hour  and  <dig>  hours  after po and im administration. half-life  for iv, im and po administration was  <dig>  hours ,  <dig>  hours  and  <dig>  hours  respectively. in comparison, bioavailability  for po administration was 22%  compared to im f at 76% .


CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study suggest that fm oral administration is not the most effective administration route for mature swine when compared to iv and im. lower f and cmax of po-fm in comparison to im-fm suggest that po-fm is less likely to be an effective therapeutic administration route.
