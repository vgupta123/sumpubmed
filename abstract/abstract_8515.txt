BACKGROUND
reference genes, which are often referred to housekeeping genes, are frequently used to normalize mrna levels between different samples. however the expression level of these genes may vary among tissues or cells, and may change under certain circumstances. thus the selection of reference gene is critical for gene expression studies. for this purpose,  <dig> commonly used housekeeping genes were investigated in isolated human neutrophils.


RESULTS
initial screening of the expression pattern demonstrated that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes were expressed at very low levels in neutrophils and were excluded from further analysis. the range of expression stability of the other  <dig> genes was : gnb2l <dig> , hprt <dig> , rpl <dig> , actb , b2m , gapd  and tbp . relative expression levels of the genes  were: b2m, actb, gapd, rpl <dig>  gnb2l <dig>  tbp, and hprt <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that gnb2l <dig>  hprt <dig>  rpl <dig>  actb, and b2m may be suitable reference genes in gene expression studies of neutrophils.
