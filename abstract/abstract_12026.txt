BACKGROUND
mink enteritis virus  causes mink viral enteritis, an acute and highly contagious disease whose symptoms include violent diarrhea, and which is characterized by high morbidity and mortality. nanoparticle-assisted polymerase chain reaction  is a recently developed technique for the rapid detection of bacterial and viral dna. here we describe a novel nanopcr assay for the clinical detection and epidemiological characterization of mev.


RESULTS
this assay is based upon primers specific for the conserved region of the mev ns <dig> gene, which encodes nonstructural protein  <dig>  under optimized conditions, the mev nanopcr assay had a detection limit of  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies recombinant plasmids per reaction, compared with  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies for conventional pcr analysis. moreover, of  <dig> clinical mink samples collected from five provinces in north-eastern china,  <dig> % were scored mev positive by our nanopcr assay, compared with  <dig> % for conventional pcr. furthermore no cross reactivity was observed for the nanopcr assay with respect to related viruses, including canine distemper virus  and aleutian mink disease parvovirus . phylogenetic analysis of four chinese wild type mev isolates using the nanopcr assay indicated that they belonged to a small mev clade, named “china type”, in the mev/fplv cluster, and were closely clustered in the same location.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the mev china type clade is currently circulating in domestic minks in china. we anticipate that the nanopcr assay we have described here will be useful for the detection and epidemiological and pathological characterization of mev.
