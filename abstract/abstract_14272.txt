BACKGROUND
transient receptor potential canonical  <dig>  is a widely-expressed mammalian cationic channel with functional effects that include stimulation of cardiovascular remodelling. the initial aim of this study was to investigate variation in trpc1-encoding gene transcripts.


RESULTS
extensive trpc <dig> transcript alternative splicing was observed, with exons  <dig>   <dig> and 5- <dig> frequently omitted, leading to variants containing premature termination codons. consistent with the predicted sensitivity of such variants to nonsense-mediated decay  the variants were increased by cycloheximide. however it was notable that control of the variants by nmd was prominent in human embryonic kidney  <dig> cells but not human vascular smooth muscle cells. the cellular difference was attributed in part to a critical protein in nmd, up-frameshift- <dig> , which was found to have low abundance in the vascular cells. rescue of upf <dig> by expression of exogenous upf <dig> was found to suppress vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation.


CONCLUSIONS
the data suggest:  extensive nmd-sensitive transcripts of trpc1;  inefficient clearance of aberrant transcripts and enhanced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells in part because of low upf <dig> expression.
