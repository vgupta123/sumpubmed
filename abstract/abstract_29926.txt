BACKGROUND
ralstonia eutropha h <dig>  found in both soil and water, is a gram-negative lithoautotrophic bacterium that can utillize co <dig> and h <dig> as its sources of carbon and energy in the absence of organic substrates. r. eutropha h <dig> can reach high cell densities either under lithoautotrophic or heterotrophic conditions, which makes it suitable for a number of biotechnological applications. it is the best known and most promising producer of polyhydroxyalkanoates  from various carbon substrates and is an environmentally important bacterium that can degrade aromatic compounds. in order to make r. eutropha h <dig> a more efficient and robust biofactory, system-wide metabolic engineering to improve its metabolic performance is essential. thus, it is necessary to analyze its metabolic characteristics systematically and optimize the entire metabolic network at systems level.


RESULTS
we present the lithoautotrophic genome-scale metabolic model of r. eutropha h <dig> based on the annotated genome with biochemical and physiological information. the stoichiometic model, rehmbel <dig>  is composed of  <dig> reactions including  <dig> transport reactions and  <dig> metabolites. constraints-based flux analyses were performed to refine and validate the genome-scale metabolic model under environmental and genetic perturbations. first, the lithoautotrophic growth characteristics of r. eutropha h <dig> were investigated under varying feeding ratios of gas mixture. second, the genome-scale metabolic model was used to design the strategies for the production of poly  under different ph values and carbon/nitrogen source uptake ratios. it was also used to analyze the metabolic characteristics of r. eutropha when the phosphofructokinase gene was expressed. finally, in silico gene knockout simulations were performed to identify targets for metabolic engineering essential for the production of 2-methylcitric acid in r. eutropha h <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the genome-scale metabolic model, rehmbel <dig>  successfully represented metabolic characteristics of r. eutropha h <dig> at systems level. the reconstructed genome-scale metabolic model can be employed as an useful tool for understanding its metabolic capabilities, predicting its physiological consequences in response to various environmental and genetic changes, and developing strategies for systems metabolic engineering to improve its metabolic performance.
