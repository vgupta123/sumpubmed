BACKGROUND
protein-protein interaction  extraction has been a focal point of many biomedical research and database curation tools. both active learning and semi-supervised svms have recently been applied to extract ppi automatically. in this paper, we explore combining the al with the ssl to improve the performance of the ppi task.

methods
we propose a novel ppi extraction technique called ppispotter by combining deterministic annealing-based ssl and an al technique to extract protein-protein interaction. in addition, we extract a comprehensive set of features from medline records by natural language processing  techniques, which further improve the svm classifiers. in our feature selection technique, syntactic, semantic, and lexical properties of text are incorporated into feature selection that boosts the system performance significantly.


RESULTS
by conducting experiments with three different ppi corpuses, we show that ppispotter is superior to the other techniques incorporated into semi-supervised svms such as random sampling, clustering, and transductive svms by precision, recall, and f-measure.


CONCLUSIONS
our system is a novel, state-of-the-art technique for efficiently extracting protein-protein interaction pairs.
