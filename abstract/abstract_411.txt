BACKGROUND
canine babesiosis is a tick-borne disease caused by hemoprotozoan parasites of the genus babesia. the disease can be clinically classified into uncomplicated and complicated forms. the aim of this study was to assess the level of endothelial activation and alterations in the fibrinolytic pathway during canine babesiosis.


RESULTS
blood samples were collected on the day of admission and on the 6th day after treatment with imidocarb propionate, from  <dig> dogs of various breeds and of both sexes with naturally occurring babesiosis caused by b. canis. in this prospective study, plasminogen activity was assessed using a chromogenic assay, and concentrations of high mobility group box- <dig> protein , intercellular adhesive molecule- <dig> , vascular adhesive molecule- <dig> , soluble urokinase receptor of plasminogen activator , thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor , soluble thrombomodulin  and plasminogen activator inhibitor- <dig>  were determined using a canine specific elisa. concentrations of tm, hmgb- <dig>  vcam- <dig> and supar were increased in dogs with babesiosis at admission compared to healthy dogs. after treatment, concentrations of tm were lower in infected dogs compared to healthy dogs. dogs with babesiosis also had increased concentrations of tm, icam- <dig> and hmgb- <dig> and decreased plasminogen and pai- <dig> at presentation compared to day  <dig> after treatment. dogs with complicated babesiosis had higher concentrations of tm, hmgb <dig> and tafi at admission compared to the 6th day.


CONCLUSIONS
biomarkers of endothelial activation and fibrinolysis were altered in dogs with babesiosis. further studies into their usefulness as biomarkers of disease severity or prognosis is warranted.
