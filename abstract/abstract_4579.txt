BACKGROUND
modulation of chromatin structure has emerged as a critical molecular device to control gene expression. histones undergo different post-translational modifications that increase chromatin accessibility to a number of regulatory factors. among them, histone ubiquitination appears relevant in nuclear processes that govern gene silencing, either by inhibiting or activating transcription, and maintain genome stability, acting as scaffold to properly organize the dna damage response. thus, it is of paramount importance the identification and the characterization of new ubiquitin ligases that address histones.


RESULTS
we identified and characterized rnf <dig>  a new chromatin-associated ring finger protein. we demonstrated that rnf <dig> is endowed with ubiquitin ligase activity both in vitro and in vivo, which targets histones h2a and h2ax, but not h2b, forming k <dig> polyubiquitin chains. we previously described the presence within rnf <dig> sequence of two miu domains, responsible for the binding to ubiquitinated proteins. here we showed that inactivation of the mius impairs ubiquitin binding ability in vitro and reduces chromatin association of rnf <dig> in vivo. moreover, upon formation of dna double strand breaks induced by chemical and physical agents, rnf <dig> is recruited to the dna damage foci, where it co-localizes with Î³h2ax and 53bp <dig>  the localization of rnf <dig> at the site of damage highly increases the local concentration of ubiquitinated proteins and determines the prolonged ubiquitination signal.


CONCLUSIONS
the ring finger protein rnf <dig> is a new ubiquitin ligase that functions as chromatin modifier, through histone ubiquitination. we hypothesize a dual function for rnf <dig>  in normal condition rnf <dig> modifies chromatin structure by modulating ubiquitination of histone h2a. upon dna lesions, rnf <dig> is recruited to dna damage response foci where it contributes to increase the amount of ubiquitinated proteins, thereby facilitating the downstream signalling cascade.
