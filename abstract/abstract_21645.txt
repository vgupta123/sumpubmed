BACKGROUND
the salivaomics knowledge base  is designed to serve as a computational infrastructure that can permit global exploration and utilization of data and information relevant to salivaomics. skb is created by aligning  the saliva biomarker discovery and validation resources at ucla with  the ontology resources developed by the obo  foundry, including a new saliva ontology .


RESULTS
we define the saliva ontology  as a consensus-based controlled vocabulary of terms and relations dedicated to the salivaomics domain and to saliva-related diagnostics following the principles of the obo  foundry.


CONCLUSIONS
the saliva ontology is an ongoing exploratory initiative. the ontology will be used to facilitate salivaomics data retrieval and integration across multiple fields of research together with data analysis and data mining. the ontology will be tested through its ability to serve the annotation  of a representative corpus of salivaomics research literature that is to be incorporated into the skb.
