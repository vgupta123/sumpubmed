BACKGROUND
the burst size of a phage is important prior to phage therapy and probiotic usage. the efficiency for a phage to burst its host bacterium can result from molecular domino effects of the phage gene expressions which dominate to control host machinery after infection. we found two podoviridae phages, ϕa <dig> and ϕas <dig>  burst a common host v. alginolyticus with different efficiencies of  <dig> and  <dig> pfu/bacterium, respectively. presumably, the genome sequences can be compared to explain their differences in burst sizes.


RESULTS
among genes in  <dig>  kb genomes with a gc content of  <dig> %,  <dig> out of  <dig> open-reading frames  were annotated to known functions, including rna polymerase  and phage structure proteins.  <dig> strong phage promoters and three terminators were found. the consensus sequence for the new vibriophage promoters is aataaagttgccctata, where the agttg bases of − <dig> through − <dig> are important for the vibriophage specificity, especially a consensus t at − <dig> position eliminating rnap of k1e, t <dig> and sp <dig> phages to transcribe the genes. ϕa <dig> and ϕas <dig> rnap shared their own specific promoters. in comparing ϕas <dig> with ϕa <dig> genomes, only two nucleotides were deleted in the rnap gene and three mutating nucleotides were found in the major capsid genes.


CONCLUSIONS
subtle analyses on the residue alterations uncovered the effects of five nucleotide mutations on the functions of the rnap and capsid proteins, which account for the host-bursting efficiency. the deletion of two nucleotides in rnap gene truncates the primary translation due to early stop codon, while a second translational peptide starting from gtg just at deletion point can remediate the polymerase activity. out of three nucleotide mutations in major capsid gene, h53n mutation weakens the subunit assembly between capsomeres for the phage head; e313k reduces the fold binding between β-sheet and spine helix inside the peptide.
