BACKGROUND
structural variation contributes to the rich genetic and phenotypic diversity of the modern domestic dog, canis lupus familiaris, although compared to other organisms, catalogs of canine copy number variants  are poorly defined. to this end, we developed a customized high-density tiling array across the canine genome and used it to discover cnvs in nine genetically diverse dogs and a gray wolf.


RESULTS
in total, we identified  <dig> cnvs that overlap  <dig> genes, which are enriched for defense/immunity, oxidoreductase, protease, receptor, signaling molecule and transporter genes. furthermore, we performed detailed comparisons between cnvs located within versus outside of segmental duplications  and find that cnvs in sds are enriched for gene content and complexity. finally, we compiled all known dog cnv regions and genotyped them with a custom acgh chip in  <dig> dogs from  <dig> diverse breeds. these data allowed us to perform the first population genetics analysis of canine structural variation and identify cnvs that potentially contribute to breed specific traits.


CONCLUSIONS
our comprehensive analysis of canine cnvs will be an important resource in genetically dissecting canine phenotypic and behavioral variation.
