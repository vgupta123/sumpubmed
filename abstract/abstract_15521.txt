BACKGROUND
cd1d is a widely expressed lipid antigen presenting molecule required for cd1d-restricted invariant natural killer t  cell development. elevated cd1d expression is detected in cd5+ il10-producing b cells, called b <dig> b cells, and is correlated with poorer prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia , a cd5+ b cell malignancy with b10-like functional properties. whether cd1d expression regulates cd5+ b cell accumulation, il <dig> competence, and antibody production in naïve mice with pathologic cd5+ b cell expansion remains untested.


RESULTS
using three different transgenic mouse models of benign or leukemic cd5+ b cell expansion, we found that cd1d was differentially expressed on cd5+ b cells between the three models, but loss of cd1d expression had no effect on cd5+ b cell abundance or inducible il <dig> expression in any of the models. interestingly, in the cll-prone eμ-tcl <dig> model, loss of cd1d expression suppressed spontaneous igg  production, whereas in the dnrag1xeμ-tcl <dig>  model of accelerated cll, loss of cd1d expression was associated with elevated numbers of splenic cd4+ and cd8+ t cells and an inverted cd4+:cd8+ t cell ratio. unexpectedly, before leukemia onset, all three transgenic cd1d-deficient mouse strains had fewer splenic transitional b cells than their cd1d-proficient counterparts.


CONCLUSIONS
the results show that cd1d expression and inkt cells are dispensable for the development, accumulation, or il <dig> competence of cd5+ b cells in mice prone to benign or leukemic cll-like b cell expansion, but reveal a novel role for inkt cells in supporting b cell progression through the transitional stage of development in these animals. these results suggest cd1d-directed therapies to target cll could be evaded by downregulating cd1d expression with little effect on continued leukemic cd5+ b cell survival. the data also imply that inkt cells help restrain pro-leukemic cd8+ t cell expansion in cll, potentially explaining a reported correlation in human cll between disease progression, the loss of nkt cells, and a paradoxical increase in cd8+ t cells.
