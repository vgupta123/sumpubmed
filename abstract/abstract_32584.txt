BACKGROUND
along with sodium/calcium  exchangers, plasma membrane ca2+ atpases  are main regulators of intracellular ca2+ levels. there are four atp2b paralogs encoded by four different genes. atp2b <dig> encodes the protein pump with the fastest activation, atp2b <dig>  in mice, the atp2b <dig> transcript has several alternate transcriptional start site variants: α, β, µ and δ. these variants are expressed in developmental and tissue specific manners. the α and β atp2b <dig> transcripts are equally expressed in the brain. αatp2b <dig> is the only transcript found in the outer hair cells of young mice . mutations in the coding region of the mouse atp2b <dig> gene indicate a narrow window for tolerated dysfunction of the atp2b <dig> protein, specifically in the auditory system. this highlights the necessity of tight regulation of this gene for normal cell physiology.


RESULTS
although atp2bs are important regulators of ca2+ in many cell types, little is known about their transcriptional regulation. this study identifies the proximal promoter of the αatp2b <dig> transcript. further investigations indicate that atoh <dig> and egr <dig> modulate promoter activity. additionally, we report that egr <dig> increases endogenous expression of atp2b <dig> transcript in two cell lines. electrophoretic mobility shift assays  indicate that egr <dig> binds to a specific site in the cpg island of the αatp2b <dig> promoter.


CONCLUSIONS
this study furthers our understanding of atp2b <dig> regulation by:  elucidating transcriptional regulatory mechanisms for atp2b <dig>  and  identifying transcription factors that modulate expression of atp2b <dig> in the brain and peripheral auditory system and  allows for future studies modulating gene expression of atp2b <dig>
