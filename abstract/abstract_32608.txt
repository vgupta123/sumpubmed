BACKGROUND
synovitis is an inflammation-related disease linked to rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, infections and trauma. this inflammation is accompanied by immune cells infiltration which initiates an inflammatory response causing pain, discomfort and affecting the normal joint function. the treatment of synovitis is based on the administration of anti-inflammatory drugs or biological agents such as platelet rich plasma and mesenchymal stem cells. however, the evaluation and validation of more effective therapies of synovitis requires the establishment of clinically relevant animal models.


RESULTS
in this study, large white pigs were pre-immunized to evaluate an antigen-induced synovitis. the immune monitoring of synovial fluids in this model allowed us the identification of il-12p <dig> and t cell subsets as immune biomarkers. moreover, the evolution of synovitis was performed by arthroscopic procedures and kinetic analysis. in summary, this paper describes an animal model of antigen-induced synovitis to be used in the evaluation of anti-inflammatory therapies.


CONCLUSIONS
the novelty of this paper lies in the development of a clinically relevant model of synovitis which permits the simultaneous evaluation of synovitis from an immunological, surgical and kinetic point of view.
