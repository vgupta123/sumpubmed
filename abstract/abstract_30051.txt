BACKGROUND
it has been reported that various types of axonal injury of hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal tract can result in degeneration of the magnocellular neurons  in hypothalamus and development of central diabetes insipidus . however, the mechanism of the degeneration and death of mcns after hypophysectomy in vivo is still unclear. this present study was aimed to disclose it and to figure out the dynamic change of central diabetes insipidus after hypophysectomy.


RESULTS
the analysis on the dynamic change of daily water consumption , daily urine volume, specific gravity of urine and plasma vasopressin concentration showed that the change pattern of them was triphasic and neuron counting showed that the degeneration of vasopressin neurons began at  <dig> d, aggravated at  <dig> d and then stabilized at  <dig> d after hypophysectomy. there was marked upregulation of cleaved caspase- <dig> expression of vasopressin neurons in hypophysectomy rats. a "ladder" pattern of migration of dna internucleosomal fragments was detected and apoptotic ultrastructure was found in these neurons. there was time correlation among the occurrence of diabetes insipidus, the changes of plasma vasopressin concentration and the degeneration of vasopressin neurons after hypophysectomy.


CONCLUSIONS
this study firstly demonstrated that apoptosis was involved in degeneration of supraoptic vasopressin neurons after hypophysectomy in vivo and development of cdi. our study on time course and correlations among water metabolism, degeneration and apoptosis of vasopressin neurons suggested that there should be an efficient therapeutic window in which irreversible cdi might be prevented by anti-apoptosis.
