BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa establishes life-long chronic airway infections in cystic fibrosis  patients. as the disease progresses, p. aeruginosa pathoadaptive variants are distinguished from the initially acquired strain. however, the genetic basis and the biology of host-bacteria interactions leading to a persistent lifestyle of p. aeruginosa are not understood. as a model system to study long term and persistent cf infections, the p. aeruginosa rp <dig>  isolated  <dig>  years after the onset of airways colonization from a cf patient, was investigated. comparisons with strains rp <dig>  isolated at the onset of the colonization, and clonal rp <dig>  isolated 7 years before rp <dig> were carried out to better characterize genomic evolution of p. aeruginosa in the context of cf pathogenicity.


RESULTS
virulence assessments in disease animal model, genome sequencing and comparative genomics analysis were performed for clinical rp <dig>  rp <dig>  rp <dig> and prototype strains. in murine model, rp <dig> showed lower lethality and a remarkable capability of long-term persistence in chronic airways infection when compared to other strains. pathological analysis of murine lungs confirmed advanced chronic pulmonary disease, inflammation and mucus secretory cells hyperplasia. genomic analysis predicted twelve genomic islands in the rp <dig> genome, some of which distinguished rp <dig> from other prototype strains and corresponded to regions of genome plasticity. further, comparative genomic analyses with sequential rp isolates showed signatures of pathoadaptive mutations in virulence factors potentially linked to the development of chronic infections in cf.


CONCLUSIONS
the genome plasticity of p. aeruginosa particularly in the rp <dig> strain strongly indicated that these alterations may form the genetic basis defining host-bacteria interactions leading to a persistent lifestyle in human lungs.
