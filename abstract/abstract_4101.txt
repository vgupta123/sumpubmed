BACKGROUND
phosphatidylinositol -trisphosphate-dependent rac exchanger  <dig>  is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor  that specifically activates rac gtpases, important regulators of actin cytoskeleton remodeling. p-rex <dig> is known to modulate cerebellar purkinje cell architecture and function, but p-rex <dig> expression and function elsewhere in the central nervous system is unclear. to better understand potential roles for p-rex <dig> in neuronal cytoskeletal remodeling and function, we performed widefield and confocal microscopy of specimens double immunolabeled for p-rex <dig> and cell- and synapse-specific markers in the mouse retina.


RESULTS
p-rex <dig> was restricted to the plexiform layers of the retina and colocalized extensively with vesicular glutamate transporter  <dig> , a specific marker for photoreceptor and bipolar cell terminals. double labeling for p-rex <dig> and peanut agglutinin, a cone terminal marker, confirmed that p-rex <dig> was present in both rod and cone terminals. double labeling with markers for specific bipolar cell types showed that p-rex <dig> was present in the terminals of rod bipolar cells and multiple on- and off-cone bipolar cell types. in contrast, p-rex <dig> was not expressed in the processes or conventional synapses of amacrine or horizontal cells.


CONCLUSIONS
p-rex <dig> is associated specifically with the glutamatergic ribbon synaptic terminals of photoreceptors and bipolar cells that transmit visual signals vertically through the retina. the rac-gef function of p-rex <dig> implies a specific role for p-rex <dig> and rac-gtpases in regulating the actin cytoskeleton in glutamatergic ribbon synaptic terminals of retinal photoreceptors and bipolar cells and appears to be ideally positioned to modulate the adaptive plasticity of these terminals.
