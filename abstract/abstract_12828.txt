BACKGROUND
the mal <dig> gene, encoding a four-transmembrane protein of the mal family, is amplified and overexpressed in breast and other cancers, yet the significance of this is unknown. mal-like proteins have trafficking functions, but their molecular roles are largely obscure, partly due to a lack of known binding partners.

methods
yeast two-hybrid screening of a breast carcinoma cdna expression library was performed using a full-length mal <dig> bait, and subsequent deletion mapping experiments were performed. mal <dig> interactions were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation analyses and confocal microscopy was employed to compare protein sub-cellular distributions. sucrose density gradient centrifugation of membranes extracted in cold triton x- <dig> was employed to compare protein distributions between triton x-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions.


RESULTS
the tumor-associated protein mucin  <dig>  was identified as a potential mal <dig> partner, with mal2/muc <dig> interactions being confirmed in myc-tagged mal2-expressing mcf-10a cells using co-immunoprecipitation assays. deletion mapping experiments demonstrated a requirement for the first mal <dig> transmembrane domain for muc <dig> binding, whereas the mal <dig> n-terminal domain was required to bind d52-like proteins. confocal microscopy identified cytoplasmic co-localisation of muc <dig> and mal <dig> in breast cell lines, and centrifugation of cell lysates to equilibrium in sucrose density gradients demonstrated that mal <dig> and muc <dig> proteins were co-distributed between triton x-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions. however co-immunoprecipitation analyses detected mal2/muc <dig> interactions in triton x-100-soluble fractions only. myc-mal <dig> expression in mcf-10a cells was associated with both increased muc <dig> detection within triton x-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions, and increased muc <dig> detection at the cell surface.


CONCLUSIONS
these results identify muc <dig> as a novel mal <dig> partner, and suggest a role for mal <dig> in regulating muc <dig> expression and/or localisation.
