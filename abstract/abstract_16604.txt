BACKGROUND
polyphosphate  has bactericidal activity against a gram-negative periodontopathogen porphyromonas gingivalis, a black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rod. however, current knowledge about the mode of action of polyp against p. gingivalis is incomplete. to elucidate the mechanisms of antibacterial action of polyp against p. gingivalis, we performed the full-genome gene expression microarrays, and gene ontology  and protein-protein interaction network analysis of differentially expressed genes .


RESULTS
we successfully identified  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes  in p. gingivalis w <dig> treated with polyp <dig> . real-time pcr confirmed the up- and down-regulation of some selected genes. go analysis of the degs identified distinct biological themes. using  <dig> degs belonging to the biological themes, we generated the protein-protein interaction network based on a database of known and predicted protein interactions. the network analysis identified biological meaningful clusters related to hemin acquisition, energy metabolism, cell envelope and cell division, ribosomal proteins, and transposon function.


CONCLUSIONS
polyp probably exerts its antibacterial effect through inhibition of hemin acquisition by the bacterium, resulting in severe perturbation of energy metabolism, cell envelope biosynthesis and cell division, and elevated transposition. further studies will be needed to elucidate the exact mechanism by which polyp induces up-regulation of the genes related to ribosomal proteins. our results will shed new light on the study of the antibacterial mechanism of polyp against other related bacteria belonging to the black-pigmented bacteroides species.
