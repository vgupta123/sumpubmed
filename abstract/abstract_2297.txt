BACKGROUND
micrornas  regulate various biological processes in plants. considerable data are available on mirnas involved in the development of rice, maize and barley. in contrast, little is known about mirnas and their functions in the development of wheat. in this study, five small rna  libraries from wheat seedlings, flag leaves, and developing seeds were developed and sequenced to identify mirnas and understand their functions in wheat development.


RESULTS
twenty-four known mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families were identified from  <dig> mirna loci in wheat in the present study, including  <dig> mirnas  first identified in wheat,  <dig> mirna families  being highly conserved and  <dig>  moderately conserved. in addition, fifty-five novel mirnas were also identified. the potential target genes for  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were predicted using strict criteria, and these target genes are involved in a wide range of biological functions. four of the  <dig> known mirna families and  <dig> of the  <dig> novel mirnas were preferentially expressed in the developing seeds with logarithm  of the fold change of  <dig>  ~  <dig> , and half of them were seed-specific, suggesting that they participate in regulating wheat seed development and metabolism. from  <dig> days post-anthesis to  <dig> days post-anthesis, mir <dig> and mir <dig> increased in abundance in the developing seeds, whereas mir <dig> decreased, suggesting their coordinating functions in the different developmental stages of wheat seed. moreover,  <dig> known mirna families and  <dig> novel mirnas exhibited tissue-biased expression in wheat flag leaves, with the logarithm of the fold changes of  <dig>  ~  <dig> . the putative targets of these tissue-preferential mirnas were involved in various metabolism and biological processes, suggesting complexity of the regulatory networks in different tissues. our data also suggested that wheat flag leaves have more complicated regulatory networks of mirnas than developing seeds.


CONCLUSIONS
our work identified and characterised wheat mirnas, their targets and expression patterns. this study is the first to elucidate the regulatory networks of mirnas involved in wheat flag leaves and developing seeds, and provided a foundation for future studies on specific functions of these mirnas.
