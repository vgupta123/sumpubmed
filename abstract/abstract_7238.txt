BACKGROUND
passively acquired maternal derived immunity  is a double-edged sword. maternal derived antibody-mediated immunity  and cell-mediated immunity  are critical immediate defenses for the neonate; however, mdi may interfere with the induction of active immunity in the neonate, i.e. passive interference. the effect of antigen-specific mdi on vaccine-induced ami and cmi responses to mycoplasma hyopneumoniae  was assessed in neonatal piglets. to determine whether cmi and ami responses could be induced in piglets with mdi, piglets with high and low levels of maternal m. hyopneumoniae-specific immunity were vaccinated against m. hyopneumoniae at  <dig> d of age. piglet m. hyopneumoniae-specific antibody, lymphoproliferation, and delayed type hypersensitivity  responses were measured  <dig> d and  <dig> d post vaccination.


RESULTS
piglets with m. hyopneumoniae-specific mdi failed to show vaccine-induced ami responses; there was no rise in m. hyopneumoniae antibody levels following vaccination of piglets in the presence of m. hyopneumoniae-specific mdi. however, piglets with m. hyopneumoniae-specific mdi had primary  and secondary  m. hyopneumoniae-specific cmi responses following vaccination.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study neonatal m. hyopneumoniae-specific cmi was not subject to passive interference by mdi. further, it appears that both maternal derived and endogenous cmi contribute to m. hyopneumoniae-specific cmi responses in piglets vaccinated in the face of mdi.
