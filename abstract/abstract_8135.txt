BACKGROUND
the scavenger receptor cysteine rich  domain is an ancient and conserved protein domain. cd <dig> and wc <dig> molecules are classed together as group b srcr superfamily members, along with spα, cd <dig> and cd <dig>  all of which are expressed by immune system cells. there are three known types of cd <dig> molecules in mammals, cd163a , cd163b  and cd163c-α , while their nearest relative, wc <dig>  is encoded by a multigene family so far identified in the artiodactyl species of cattle, sheep, and pigs.


RESULTS
we annotated the bovine genome and identified genes coding for bovine cd163a and cd163c-α but found no evidence for cd163b. bovine cd163a is widely expressed in immune cells, whereas cd163c-α transcripts are enriched in the wc1+ γδ t cell population. phylogenetic analyses of the cd <dig> family genes and wc <dig> showed that cd163c-α is most closely related to wc <dig> and that chicken and platypus have wc <dig> orthologous genes, previously classified as among their cd <dig> genes.


CONCLUSIONS
since it has been shown that wc <dig> plays an important role in the regulation of γδ t cell responses in cattle, which, like chickens, have a high percentage of γδ t cells in their peripheral blood, cd163c-α may play a similar role, especially in species lacking wc <dig> genes. our results suggest that gene duplications resulted in the expansion of cd163c-α-like and wc1-like molecules. this expanded repertoire was retained by species known as "γδ t cell high", but homologous srcr molecules were maintained by all mammals.
