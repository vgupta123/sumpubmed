BACKGROUND
recently, a propanol-based hand rub has been described to exceed the efficacy requirements of the european standard en  <dig> in only  <dig>  min significantly. but the effect of a  <dig> min preceding hand wash and the effect of one additional minute for evaporation of the alcohol after its application on the efficacy after a  <dig>  min application time has never been studied.

methods
we have investigated a propanol-based hand rub  in three variations: with  and without  a  <dig> min hand wash before the disinfection of  <dig>  min with immediate sampling after the disinfection; and  without a hand wash before the disinfection but with sampling  <dig> min after the disinfection. the efficacy of the three variations was compared to the reference treatment of en  <dig>  all experiments were performed in a latin-square design with  <dig> volunteers. pre- and post-values  were obtained according to en  <dig> 


RESULTS
the  <dig> min reference disinfection reduced resident hand bacteria on average by  <dig>  log <dig> steps  and  <dig>  log10-steps  respectively. method a was equally effective as the reference . method b seemed to be more effective . method c revealed the best efficacy . a comparison of all three treatment variations and the reference treatment revealed a significant difference for the immediate efficacy , but not for the sustained efficacy . a post-hoc-test for the immediate efficacy indicated a significant difference between methods a and c . hence, none of the treatment variations was significantly less effective than the reference treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
an application of the propanol-based hand rub for  <dig>  min after  <dig> min hand wash fulfills the efficacy requirements of en  <dig>  the efficacy can be improved to some extent by omitting the preceding hand wash and by awaiting the evaporation of the alcohol which is clinical practice anyway. the preceding hand wash has the most negative effect on the immediate effect. based on our data hands should not be routinely washed before the disinfection period unless there is a good reason for it such as visible soiling.
