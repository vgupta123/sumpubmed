BACKGROUND
cystic echinococcosis, which is caused by echinococcus granulosus, is one of the most widespread zoonotic helminth diseases that affects humans and livestock. dogs, which harbor adult worms in their small intestines, are a pivotal source of e. granulosus infection in humans and domestic animals. therefore, novel molecular approaches for the prevention and diagnosis of this parasite infection in dogs need to be developed.


RESULTS
in this study, we performed proteomic analysis to identify excretory/secretory products  and antigenic proteins of e. granulosus adult worms using two-dimensional electrophoresis, tandem matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight , and western blotting of sera from infected dogs. this study identified  <dig> es product spots corresponding to  <dig> different proteins and  <dig> antigenic protein spots corresponding to  <dig> different proteins. six antigenic proteins were identified for the first time.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study extended the existing proteomic data of e. granulosus and provides further information regarding host-parasite interactions and survival mechanisms. the results of this study contribute to vaccination and immunodiagnoses for e. granulosus infections.
