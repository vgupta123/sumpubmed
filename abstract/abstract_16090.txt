BACKGROUND
the p <dig> signalling pathway has hundreds of inputs and outputs. it can trigger cellular senescence, cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to diverse stress conditions, including dna damage, hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. signals from all these inputs are channeled through a single node, the transcription factor p <dig>  yet, the pathway is flexible enough to produce different downstream gene expression patterns in response to different stresses.


RESULTS
we construct a mathematical model of the negative feedback loop involving p <dig> and its inhibitor, mdm <dig>  at the core of this pathway, and use it to examine the effect of different stresses that trigger p <dig>  in response to dna damage, hypoxia, etc., the model exhibits a wide variety of specific output behaviour - steady states with low or high levels of p <dig> and mdm <dig>  as well as spiky oscillations with low or high average p <dig> levels.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that even a simple negative feedback loop is capable of exhibiting the kind of flexible stress-specific response observed in the p <dig> system. further, our model provides a framework for predicting the differences in p <dig> response to different stresses and single nucleotide polymorphisms.
