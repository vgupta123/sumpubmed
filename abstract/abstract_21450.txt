BACKGROUND
the optimization of protein production is a complex and challenging problem in biotechnology. different techniques for transcription, translation engineering and the optimization of cell culture conditions have been used to improve protein secretion, but there remain many open problems involving post-translational modifications of the secreted protein and cell line stability.


RESULTS
in this work, we focus on the regulation of secreted protein specific productivity ) by controlling the expression of the spliced form of human x-box binding protein ) in chinese hamster ovary cells  under doxycycline  induction at different temperatures. we observed a four-fold increase in specific igg productivity by cho cells under elevated concentrations of dox at 30°c compared to 37°c, without detectable differences in binding activity in vitro or changes in the structural integrity of igg. in addition, we found a correlation between the overexpression of human xbp- <dig>  size expansion) and the specific igg productivity under dox induction.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest the t-rex system overexpressing human xbp- <dig> can be successfully used in cho-k <dig> cells for human immunoglobulin production.
