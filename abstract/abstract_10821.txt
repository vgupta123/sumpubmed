BACKGROUND
current research suggests that a small set of “driver” mutations are responsible for tumorigenesis while a larger body of “passenger” mutations occur in the tumor but do not progress the disease. due to recent pharmacological successes in treating cancers caused by driver mutations, a variety of methodologies that attempt to identify such mutations have been developed. based on the hypothesis that driver mutations tend to cluster in key regions of the protein, the development of cluster identification algorithms has become critical.


RESULTS
we have developed a novel methodology, spacepac , that identifies mutational clustering by considering the protein tertiary structure directly in 3d space. by combining the mutational data in the catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer  and the spatial information in the protein data bank , spacepac is able to identify novel mutation clusters in many proteins such as fgfr <dig> and chrm <dig>  in addition, spacepac is better able to localize the most significant mutational hotspots as demonstrated in the cases of braf and alk. the r package is available on bioconductor at: http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/spacepac.html.


CONCLUSIONS
spacepac adds a valuable tool to the identification of mutational clusters while considering protein tertiary structure.
