BACKGROUND
in this study, we have investigated the viscoelastic behaviour of individual human adult bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells  and the role of f-actin filaments in maintaining these properties, using micropipette aspiration technique together with a standard linear viscoelastic solid model.


RESULTS
under a room temperature of 20°c, the instantaneous and equilibrium young's modulus, e <dig> and e∞, were found to be  <dig> ±  <dig> pa and  <dig> ±  <dig> pa, respectively, while the apparent viscosity, μ, was  <dig> ±  <dig> pa·s. hmscs treated with cytochalasin d up to  <dig> μm at 20°c registered significant drop of up to 84% in stiffness and increase of up to 255% in viscosity. at the physiological temperature of 37°c, e <dig> and e∞ have decreased by 42–66% whereas μ has increased by 95%, compared to the control. majority of the hmscs behave as viscoelastic solid with a rapid initial increase in aspiration length and it gradually levels out with time. three other types of non-typical viscoelastic behavior of hmscs were also seen.


CONCLUSIONS
hmscs behave as viscoelastic solid. its viscoelstic behaviour are dependent on the structural integrity of the f-actin filaments and temperature.
