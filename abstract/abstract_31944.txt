BACKGROUND
the promoter of the keratin  <dig>  gene is 5- to 10-fold more active in tumorigenic  cell clones derived from the sw613-s human colon carcinoma cell line than in non-tumorigenic  clones. we have reported previously that the mechanism responsible for this differential activity is acting on the minimal k <dig> promoter . this mechanism does not require the binding of a factor to a specific site on the dna but involves the acetylation of a non-histone substrate. to get further insight into this mechanism, we investigated the effect of the adenovirus e1a protein on the activity of the k <dig> promoter, both in t and nt cells.


RESULTS
wild type adenovirus e1a protein and c-terminal deletion mutants inhibit the k <dig> promoter, specifically in t-type cells. the domain responsible for this inhibitory effect is located in the 12â€“ <dig> region of the viral protein. e1a mutants that have lost this region but retain the pldls motif  stimulate the k <dig> promoter, specifically in nt cells. the inhibitory or stimulatory effects of the different e1a mutants are not dependent on a particular sequence of the promoter. an e1a n-terminal deletion mutant carrying point mutations in the pldls motif cannot stimulate the k <dig> promoter. ctbp <dig> interacts with ctip, which is a known partner of brca <dig>  itself a component of the rna polymerase ii holoenzyme. the stimulatory effect of two brca <dig> mutants, specifically in nt cells, implicates a tripartite brca1-ctip-ctbp <dig> complex in the regulation of the k <dig> promoter.


CONCLUSIONS
since we have shown previously that the k <dig> promoter is stimulated by deacetylase inhibitors, specifically in nt cells, we conclude that the activity of the promoter is repressed in nt cells by a mechanism involving the recruitment, by a brca1/ctip complex, of ctbp <dig> and associated deacetylases to the preinitiation complex. we propose a model depicting the mechanism responsible for the differential activity of the k <dig> promoter between t and nt cells of the sw613-s cell line.
