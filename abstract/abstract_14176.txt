BACKGROUND
representatives of cetacea have the greatest absolute brain size among animals, and the largest relative brain size aside from humans. despite this, genes implicated in the evolution of large brain size in primates have yet to be surveyed in cetaceans.


RESULTS
we sequenced ~ <dig> basepairs of the brain development gene microcephalin  in  <dig> cetacean species. alignments of these data and a published complete sequence from tursiops truncatus with primate mcph <dig> were utilized in phylogenetic analyses and to estimate ω  using site and branch models of molecular evolution. we also tested the hypothesis that selection on mcph <dig> was correlated with brain size in cetaceans using a continuous regression analysis that accounted for phylogenetic history. our analyses revealed widespread signals of adaptive evolution in the mcph <dig> of cetacea and in other subclades of mammalia, however, there was not a significant positive association between ω and brain size within cetacea.


CONCLUSIONS
in conjunction with a recent study of primates, we find no evidence to support an association between mcph <dig> evolution and the evolution of brain size in highly encephalized mammalian species. our finding of significant positive selection in mcph <dig> may be linked to other functions of the gene.
