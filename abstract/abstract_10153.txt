BACKGROUND
mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascades are highly conserved signaling modules that mediate the transduction of extracellular stimuli via receptors/sensors into intracellular responses and play key roles in plant immunity against pathogen attack. however, the function of tomato mapk kinases, slmkks, in resistance against botrytis cinerea remains unclear yet.


RESULTS
a total of five slmkk genes with one new member, slmkk <dig>  were identified in tomato. qrt-pcr analyses revealed that expression of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> was strongly induced by b. cinerea and by jasmonic acid and ethylene precursor 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid. virus-induced gene silencing -based knockdown of individual slmkks and disease assays identified that slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> but not other three slmkks  are involved in resistance against b. cinerea. silencing of slmkk <dig> or slmkk <dig> resulted in reduced resistance to b. cinerea, increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species and attenuated expression of defense genes after infection of b. cinerea in tomato plants. furthermore, transient expression of constitutively active phosphomimicking forms slmkk2dd and slmkk4dd in leaves of nicotiana benthamiana plants led to enhanced resistance to b. cinerea and elevated expression of defense genes.


CONCLUSIONS
vigs-based knockdown of slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> expression in tomato and gain-of-function transient expression of constitutively active phosphomimicking forms slmkk2dd and slmkk2dd in n. benthamiana demonstrate that both slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> function as positive regulators of defense response against b. cinerea.
