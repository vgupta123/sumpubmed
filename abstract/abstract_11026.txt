BACKGROUND
interferons  are potent antiviral cytokines capable of reprogramming the macrophage phenotype through the induction of interferon-stimulated genes . here we have used targeted rna interference to suppress the expression of a number of key genes associated with ifn signalling in murine macrophages prior to stimulation with interferon-gamma. genome-wide changes in transcript abundance caused by sirna activity were measured using exon-level microarrays in the presence or absence of ifnγ.


RESULTS
transfection of murine bone-marrow derived macrophages  with a non-targeting  sirna and  <dig> sequence-specific sirnas was performed using a cationic lipid transfection reagent  prior to stimulation with ifnγ. total rna was harvested from cells and gene expression measured on affymetrix genechip mouse exon  <dig>  st arrays. network-based analysis of these data revealed six sirnas to cause a marked shift in the macrophage transcriptome in the presence or absence ifnγ. these six sirnas targeted the ifnb <dig>  irf <dig>  irf <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig> and nfkb <dig> transcripts. the perturbation of the transcriptome by the six sirnas was highly similar in each case and affected the expression of over  <dig> downstream transcripts. regulated transcripts were clustered based on co-expression into five major groups corresponding to transcriptional networks associated with the type i and ii ifn response, cell cycle regulation, and nf-kb signalling. in addition we have observed a significant non-specific immune stimulation of cells transfected with sirna using lipofectamine <dig>  suggesting use of this reagent in bmdms, even at low concentrations, is enough to induce a type i ifn response.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide evidence that the type i ifn response in murine bmdms is dependent on ifnb <dig>  irf <dig>  irf <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig> and nfkb <dig>  and that sirnas targeted to these genes results in perturbation of key transcriptional networks associated with type i and type ii ifn signalling and a suppression of macrophage m <dig> polarization.
