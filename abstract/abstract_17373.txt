BACKGROUND
under conditions of cardiovascular dysfunction, protease-activated receptor  <dig>  agonists maintain vasodilatation activity, which has been attributed to increased cyclooxygenase- <dig>  nitric oxide synthase and calcium-activated potassium channel  activities. protease-activated receptor  <dig> agonist mediated vasodilatation is unknown under conditions of dysfunction caused by angiotensin ii. the main purpose of our study was to determine whether par2-induced vasodilatation of resistance arteries was attenuated by prolonged angiotensin ii treatment in mice. we compared the vasodilatation of resistance-type arteries  from angiotensin ii-treated par <dig> wild-type mice  induced by par <dig> agonist 2-furoyl-ligrlo-amide  to the responses obtained in controls . we also investigated arterial vasodilatation in angiotensin ii-treated par <dig> deficient  mice.


RESULTS
2fly-induced relaxations of untreated arteries from angiotensin ii-treated wt were not different than saline-treated wt. treatment of arteries with nitric oxide synthase inhibitor and sk <dig>  inhibitor  blocked 2fly in angiotensin ii-treated wt. protein and mrna expression of cyclooxygenase- <dig> and - <dig> were increased, and cyclooxygenase activity increased the sensitivity of arteries to 2fly in only angiotensin ii-treated wt. these protective vasodilatation mechanisms were selective for 2fly compared with acetylcholine- and nitroprusside-induced relaxations which were attenuated by angiotensin ii; par2-/- were protected against this attenuation of nitroprusside.


CONCLUSIONS
par2-mediated vasodilatation of resistance type arteries is protected against the negative effects of angiotensin ii-induced vascular dysfunction in mice. in conditions of endothelial dysfunction, angiotensin ii induction of cyclooxygenases increases sensitivity to par <dig> agonist and the preserved vasodilatation mechanism involves activation of sk <dig> .
