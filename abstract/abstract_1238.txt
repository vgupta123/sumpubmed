BACKGROUND
the genus nelumbo adans. comprises two living species, n. nucifera gaertan.  and n. lutea pers. . a genetic linkage map is an essential resource for plant genetic studies and crop improvement but has not been generated for nelumbo. we aimed to develop genomic simple sequence repeat  markers from the genome sequence and construct two genetic maps for nelumbo to assist genome assembly and integration of a genetic map with the genome sequence.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  ssr motifs were identified from the genome sequences. di- and tri-nucleotide repeat motifs were the most abundant, and accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all ssrs, respectively. ag/ga repeats constituted  <dig> % of dinucleotide repeat motifs, followed by at/ta . of  <dig> ssr primers tested,  <dig>  produced scorable alleles with an average of  <dig>  per primer, and  <dig>  showed polymorphism among two parental genotypes, n. nucifera ‘chinese antique’ and n. lutea ‘al1’, and six progenies of their f <dig> population. the normally segregating markers, which comprised  <dig> newly developed ssrs,  <dig> previously published ssrs and  <dig> sequence-related amplified polymorphism markers, were used for genetic map construction. the map for asian lotus was  <dig>  cm with  <dig> markers distributed in seven linkage groups. the map for american lotus was  <dig>  cm, and contained  <dig> markers distributed in  <dig> genetic linkage groups. the number of markers per linkage group ranged from three to  <dig> with an average genetic distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. moreover,  <dig> ssr markers contained in linkage groups were anchored to  <dig> genomic dna sequence contigs of ‘chinese antique’. the  <dig> contigs were merged into  <dig> scaffolds.


CONCLUSIONS
genetic mapping of ssr markers derived from sequenced contigs in nelumbo enabled the associated contigs to be anchored in the linkage map and facilitated assembly of the genome sequences of ‘chinese antique’. the present study reports the first construction of genetic linkage maps for nelumbo, which can serve as reference linkage maps to accelerate characterization germplasm, genetic mapping for traits of economic interest, and molecular breeding with marker-assisted selection.
