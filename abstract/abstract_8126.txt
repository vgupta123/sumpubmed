BACKGROUND
fires have been widespread over the last  <dig> million years, peaking 60âˆ’ <dig> million years ago , and might therefore have played a key role in the evolution of angiosperms. yet it is commonly believed that fireprone communities existed only after the global climate became more arid and seasonal  <dig> ma. recent molecular-based studies point to much earlier origins of fireprone angiosperm floras in australia and south africa  but even these were constrained by the ages of the clades examined.


RESULTS
using a molecular-dated phylogeny for the great gondwanan family proteaceae, with a 113-million-year evolutionary history, we show that the ancestors of many of its characteristic sclerophyll genera, such as protea, conospermum, leucadendron, petrophile, adenanthos and leucospermum , occurred in fireprone habitats from  <dig> ma . this coincided with the highest atmospheric oxygen  levels experienced over the past  <dig> million years. migration from non-fireprone  environments was accompanied by the evolution of highly speciose clades with a range of seed storage traits and fire-cued seed release or germination mechanisms that was diagnostic for each clade by  <dig> ma, though the ant-dispersed lineage  was delayed until  <dig> ma.


CONCLUSIONS
focusing on the widespread 113-million-year-old family proteaceae, fireproneness among gondwanan angiosperm floras can now be traced back almost  <dig> million years into the fiery cretaceous. the associated evolution of on-plant  and soil seed storage, and later ant dispersal, affirms them as ancient adaptations to fire among flowering plants.
