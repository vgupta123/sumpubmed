BACKGROUND
the cattle  genome was originally selected for sequencing due to its economic importance and unique biology as a model organism for understanding other ruminants, or mammals. currently, there are two cattle genome sequence assemblies  from groups using dissimilar assembly algorithms, which were complemented by genetic and physical map resources. however, past comparisons between these assemblies revealed substantial differences. consequently, such discordances have engendered ambiguities when using reference sequence data, impacting genomic studies in cattle and motivating construction of a new optical map resource--btom <dig> --to guide comparisons and improvements to the current sequence builds. accordingly, our comprehensive comparisons of btom <dig>  against the umd <dig>  and btau <dig>  sequence builds tabulate large-to-immediate scale discordances requiring mediation.


RESULTS
the optical map, btom <dig> , spanning the b. taurus genome  was assembled from an optical map dataset consisting of  <dig> , <dig>  single molecule optical maps  generated by the optical mapping system. the bamhi map spans  <dig> .30 mb and comprises  <dig> optical contigs assembled by a combination of iterative  and de novo assembly techniques. btom <dig>  is a high-resolution physical map featuring an average restriction fragment size of  <dig>  kb. comparisons of btom <dig>  vs. umd <dig> , or btau <dig> , revealed that btau <dig>  presented far more discordances  vs. umd <dig>  . overall, we found that btau <dig>  presented almost double the number of discordances than umd <dig>  across most of the  <dig> categories of sequence vs. map discrepancies, which are: complex , dels , inss , its , ecs  and mcs .


CONCLUSIONS
alignments of umd <dig>  and btau <dig>  to btom <dig>  reveal discordances commensurate with previous reports, and affirm the ncbi’s current designation of umd <dig>  sequence assembly as the “reference assembly” and the btau <dig>  as the “alternate assembly.” the cattle genome optical map, btom <dig> , when used as a comprehensive and largely independent guide, will greatly assist improvements to existing sequence builds, and later serve as an accurate physical scaffold for studies concerning the comparative genomics of cattle breeds.
