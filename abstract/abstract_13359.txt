BACKGROUND
bifidobacterium thermophilum rbl <dig> , a human fecal isolate and health promoting candidate shows antagonistic and protective effects against salmonella and listeria spec. in vitro. however, the underlying mechanisms fostering these effects remain unknown. in this study, the interactions of rbl <dig> and salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium n- <dig>  were explored by global transcriptional analysis.


RESULTS
growth experiments were performed in a complex nutritive medium with controlled ph of  <dig>  and suitable for balanced growth of both rbl <dig> and n- <dig>  rbl <dig> growth was slightly enhanced in presence of n- <dig>  conversely, n- <dig> showed reduced growth in the presence of rbl <dig>  transcriptional analyses revealed higher expression of stress genes and amino acid related function in rbl <dig> in co-culture with n- <dig> when compared to mono-culture. repression of the phop regulator was observed in n- <dig> in presence of rbl <dig>  further, rbl <dig> activated virulence genes located on the salmonella pathogenicity islands  <dig> and  <dig>  flagellar genes, however, were repressed by rbl <dig>  sequential expression of flagellar, spi  <dig> and fimbrial genes is essential for salmonella infection. our data revealed that rbl <dig> triggers expression of spi  <dig> and fimbrial determinants prematurely, potentially leading to redundant energy expenditure. in the competitive environment of the gut such energy expenditure could lead to enhanced clearing of salmonella.


CONCLUSIONS
our study provides first insights into probiotic-pathogen interactions on global transcriptional level and suggests that deregulation of virulence gene expression might be an additional protective mechanism of probiotica against infections of the host.
