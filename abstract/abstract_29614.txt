BACKGROUND
many fungal species occur across a variety of habitats. particularly lichens, fungi forming symbioses with photosynthetic partners, have evolved remarkable tolerances for environmental extremes. despite their ecological importance and ubiquity, little is known about the genetic basis of adaption in lichen populations. here we studied patterns of genome-wide differentiation in the lichen-forming fungus lasallia pustulata along an altitudinal gradient in the mediterranean region. we resequenced six populations as pools and identified highly differentiated genomic regions. we then detected gene-environment correlations while controlling for shared population history and pooled sequencing bias, and performed ecophysiological experiments to assess fitness differences of individuals from different environments.


RESULTS
we detected two strongly differentiated genetic clusters linked to mediterranean and temperate-oceanic climate, and an admixture zone, which coincided with the transition between the two bioclimates. high altitude individuals showed ecophysiological adaptations to wetter and more shaded conditions. highly differentiated genome regions contained a number of genes associated with stress response, local environmental adaptation, and sexual reproduction.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together our results provide evidence for a complex interplay between demographic history and spatially varying selection acting on a number of key biological processes, suggesting a scenario of ecological speciation.
