BACKGROUND
matrix metalloproteinases   <dig> and  <dig> are two gelatinase members which have been found elevated in exudative pleural effusions. in endothelial cells these mmps increase paracellular permeability via the disruption of tight junction  proteins occludin and claudin. in the present study it was investigated if mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> alter permeability properties of the pleura tissue by degradation of tj proteins in pleural mesothelium.


RESULTS
in the present study the transmesothelial resistance  of sheep pleura tissue was recorded in ussing chambers after the addition of mmp <dig> or mmp <dig>  both enzymes reduced rtm of the pleura, implying an increase in pleural permeability. the localization and expression of tj proteins, occludin and claudin- <dig>  were assessed after incubation with mmps by indirect immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. our results revealed that incubation with mmps did not alter neither proteins localization at cell periphery nor their expression.


CONCLUSIONS
mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> increase the permeability of sheep pleura and this finding suggests a role for mmps in pleural fluid formation. tight junction proteins remain intact after incubation with mmps, contrary to previous studies which have shown tj degradation by mmps. probably mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> augment pleural permeability via other mechanisms.
