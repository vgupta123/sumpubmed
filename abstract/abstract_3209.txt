BACKGROUND
the corn smut fungus ustilago maydis is a well-established model system for molecular phytopathology. in addition, it recently became evident that u. maydis and humans share proteins and cellular processes that are not found in the standard fungal model saccharomyces cerevisiae. this prompted us to do a comparative analysis of the predicted proteome of u. maydis, s. cerevisiae and humans.


RESULTS
at a cut off at 20% identity over protein length, all three organisms share  <dig> proteins, whereas both fungi share only  <dig> conserved proteins. despite the evolutionary distance between u. maydis and humans,  <dig> proteins were shared. when applying a more stringent criterion , we found  <dig> proteins for the comparison of u. maydis and humans, whereas the both fungi share only  <dig> fungal specific proteins. finally, we found that s. cerevisiae and humans shared  <dig> proteins. in the u. maydis to h. sapiens homology set  <dig> proteins are functionally classified and  <dig> proteins are related to serious human diseases. however, a large portion of  <dig> proteins are of unknown function.


CONCLUSIONS
the fungus u. maydis has a long history of being a model system for understanding dna recombination and repair, as well as molecular plant pathology. the identification of functionally un-characterized genes that are conserved in humans and u. maydis opens the door for experimental work, which promises new insight in the cell biology of the mammalian cell.
