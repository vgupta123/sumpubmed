BACKGROUND
acetyl-xylan esterase  hydrolyses acetate group from the linear chain of xylopyranose residues bound by Î²- <dig> -linkage. the enzyme finds commercial applications in bio-bleaching of wood pulp, treating animal feed to increase digestibility, processing food to increase clarification and converting lignocellulosics to feedstock and fuel. in the present study, we report on the production of an extracellular axe from penicillium notatum nrrl- <dig> by solid state fermentation .


RESULTS
wheat bran at a level of  <dig> g  was optimized as the basal substrate for axe production. an increase in enzyme activity was observed when  <dig>  ml of mineral salt solution  containing  <dig> % kh2po <dig>   <dig> % kcl,  <dig> % mgso <dig> h2o,  <dig> % nano <dig>   <dig> % feso <dig> h2o and  <dig> %  tween- <dig> as an initial moisture content was used. various nitrogen sources including ammonium sulphate, urea, peptone and yeast extract were compared for enzyme production. maximal enzyme activity of  <dig> u/g was accomplished which was found to be highly significant . a noticeable enhancement in enzyme activity was observed when the process parameters including incubation period , initial ph ,  <dig> %  urea as nitrogen source and  <dig> %  tween- <dig> as a stimulator were further optimized using a 2-factorial plackett-burman design.


CONCLUSIONS
from the results it is clear that an overall improvement of more than 35% in terms of net enzyme activity was achieved compared to previously reported studies. this is perhaps the first report dealing with the use of p. notatum for axe production under batch culture ssf. the plackett-burman model terms were found highly significant , suggesting the potential commercial utility of the culture used .
