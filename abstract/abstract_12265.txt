BACKGROUND
various cancer cells, including those of colorectal cancer , release microvesicles  into surrounding tissues and peripheral circulation. these microvesicles can mediate communication between cells and affect various tumor-related processes in their target cells.


RESULTS
we present potential roles of crc cell-derived microvesicles in tumor progression via a global comparative microvesicular and cellular transcriptomic analysis of human sw <dig> crc cells. we first identified  <dig>  microvesicular mrnas involved in tumorigenesis-related processes that reflect the physiology of donor crc cells. we then found  <dig> mrnas enriched in the microvesicles above donor cell levels, of which  <dig> were involved in cell cycle-related processes. network analysis revealed that most of the cell cycle-related microvesicle-enriched mrnas were associated with m-phase activities. the integration of two mrna datasets showed that these m-phase-related mrnas were differentially regulated across crc patients, suggesting their potential roles in tumor progression. finally, we experimentally verified the network-driven hypothesis by showing a significant increase in proliferation of endothelial cells treated with the microvesicles.


CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates that crc cell-derived microvesicles are enriched in cell cycle-related mrnas that promote proliferation of endothelial cells, suggesting that microvesicles of cancer cells can be involved in tumor growth and metastasis by facilitating angiogenesis-related processes. this information will help elucidate the pathophysiological functions of tumor-derived microvesicles, and aid in the development of cancer diagnostics, including colorectal cancer.
