BACKGROUND
the importance of apoptosis in the injury sustained by the human myocardium during ischaemia and reoxygenation and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. to quantify apoptosis and necrosis induced by simulated ischaemia/reoxygenation in the human atrial myocardium, free-hand sections of right atrial appendage  were subjected to  <dig> minutes simulated ischaemia followed by  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours reoxygenation.


RESULTS
apoptosis, as assessed by tunel, was greater than necrosis after  <dig> minutes simulated ischaemia and  <dig> hours reoxygenation  but necrosis was greater than apoptosis by  <dig> hours reoxygenation . total caspase activation was similar after  <dig> minutes simulated ischaemia followed by  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours reoxygenation . however, caspase- <dig> like activation was higher at  <dig> hours than at  <dig> hours reoxygenation . inhibition of caspase- <dig> by z.devd.fmk  almost completely abolished apoptosis from  <dig>  ±  <dig> % to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % , without affecting necrosis.


CONCLUSIONS
cell death by apoptosis and necrosis in the human myocardium subjected to simulated ischaemia/reoxygenation depends on the degree of the ischaemic insult and have a different time-course with apoptosis happening early during reoxygenation and necrosis becoming more important later. importantly, the apoptosis induced by simulated ischaemia/reoxygenation is mainly mediated by activation of caspase- <dig> but it does not affect necrosis.
