BACKGROUND
chlamydia is gram-negative obligate bacteria which causes a wide variety of diseases in humans and animals. to date, there are a few reports about the seroprevalence of chlamydia and the risk factors associated with chlamydia infection in yaks in the world. in this study,  <dig> blood samples were collected from white yaks  in tianzhu tibetan autonomous county, gansu province, northwest china from june  <dig> to april  <dig> 


RESULTS
antibodies against chlamydia abortus were examined by the indirect hemagglutination  test, and  <dig> of  <dig>  white yaks were seropositive for c. abortus antibodies at the cut-off of 1: <dig>  the risk factors associated with seroprevalence were evaluated by a multivariate logistic regression analysis. region, gender and age of white yak were left out of the final model, due to its insignificance in the logistic regression analysis . however, season was considered as a major risk factor associated with c. abortus infection in white yaks.


CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first survey of c. abortus seroprevalence in white yaks in china, which extends the host range for c. abortus and has important implications for public health and the local tibetan economy.
