BACKGROUND
two species of wild silkworms, the chinese oak silkworm  and the castor silkworm philosamia cynthia ricini, can acquire a serious disease caused by nucleopolyhedrin viruses  . the two viruses have similar polyhedral morphologies and their viral fragments share high sequence similarity. however, the physical maps of the viral genomes and cross-infectivity of the viruses are different. the genome sequences of two anpenpv isolates have been published.


RESULTS
we sequenced and analyzed the full-length genome of phcynpv to compare the gene contents of the two viruses. the genome of phcynpv is  <dig>   <dig> bp, with a g + c content of  <dig> %, and encodes  <dig> open reading frames  of at least  <dig> amino acids  . between phcynpv and anpemnpv-l and -z isolates,  <dig> orfs are identical, including  <dig> baculovirus core genes. nine orfs were only found in phcynpv. four genes, cath, v-chi, lef  <dig> and lef  <dig>  were not found in phcynpv. however, most of the six genes required for infectivity via the oral route were found in phcynpv and in the two anpenpv isolates, with high sequence similarities. the pif- <dig> gene of phcynpv contained  <dig> aa extra amino acids at the n-terminus compared with anpenpv.


CONCLUSIONS
most of the genes in phcynpv are similar to the two anpenpv isolates, including the direction of expression of the orfs. only a few genes were missing from phcynpv. these data suggest that phcynpv and anpenpv might be variants of each other, and that the differences in cross-infection might be caused by gene mutations.
