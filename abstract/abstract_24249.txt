BACKGROUND
previously we have identified a distal region of the rainbow trout  metallothionein-a  enhancer region, being essential for free radical activation of the rtmt-a gene. the distal promoter region included four activator protein  <dig>  cis-acting elements and a single nuclear factor interleukin- <dig>  element. in the present study we used the rainbow trout hepatoma  cell line to further examine the involvement of nf-il <dig> and ap <dig> in rtmt-a gene expression following exposure to oxidative stress and tumour promotion.


RESULTS
using enhancer deletion studies we observed strong paraquat -induced rtmt-a activation via nf-il <dig> while the ap <dig> cis-elements showed a weak but significant activation. in contrast to mammals the metal responsive elements were not activated by oxidative stress. electrophoretic mobility shift assay  mutation analysis revealed that the two most proximal ap <dig> elements, ap <dig> , exhibited strong binding to the ap <dig> consensus sequence, while the more distal ap <dig> elements, ap <dig>  were ineffective. phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate , a known tumor promoter, resulted in a robust induction of rtmt-a via the ap <dig> elements alone. to determine the conservation of regulatory functions we transfected human hep g <dig> cells with the rtmt-a enhancer constructs and were able to demonstrate that the cis-elements were functionally conserved. the importance of nf-il <dig> in regulation of teleost mt is supported by the conservation of these elements in mt genes from different teleosts. in addition, pma and pq injection of rainbow trout resulted in increased hepatic rtmt-a mrna levels.


CONCLUSIONS
these studies suggest that ap <dig> primarily is involved in pma regulation of the rtmt-a gene while nf-il <dig> is involved in free radical regulation. taken together this study demonstrates the functionality of the nf-il <dig> and ap- <dig> elements and suggests an involvement of mt in protection during pathological processes such as inflammation and cancer.
