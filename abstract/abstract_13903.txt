BACKGROUND
grapevine  is the most important mediterranean fruit crop, used to produce both wine and spirits as well as table grape and raisins. wine and table grape cultivars represent two divergent germplasm pools with different origins and domestication history, as well as differential characteristics for berry size, cluster architecture and berry chemical profile, among others. ‘sultanina’ plays a pivotal role in modern table grape breeding providing the main source of seedlessness. this cultivar is also one of the most planted for fresh consumption and raisins production. given its importance, we sequenced it and implemented a novel strategy for the de novo assembly of its highly heterozygous genome.


RESULTS
our approach produced a draft genome of  <dig> mb, recovering 82% of the genes present in the grapevine reference genome; in addition, we identified  <dig> novel genes. a large number of structural variants and snps were identified. among them,  <dig>  were experimentally confirmed in ‘sultanina’ and six snps in other  <dig> table grape varieties. transposable elements corresponded to ca. 80% of the repetitive sequences involved in structural variants and more than  <dig>  genes were affected in their structure by these variants. some of these genes are likely involved in embryo development, suggesting that they may contribute to seedlessness, a key trait for table grapes.


CONCLUSIONS
this work produced the first structural variants and snps catalog for grapevine, constituting a novel and very powerful tool for genomic studies in this key fruit crop, particularly useful to support marker assisted breeding in table grapes.
