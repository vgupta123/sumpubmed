BACKGROUND
in tropical countries, losses caused by bovine tick rhipicephalus  microplus infestation have a tremendous economic impact on cattle production systems. genetic variation between bos taurus and bos indicus to tick resistance and molecular biology tools might allow for the identification of molecular markers linked to resistance traits that could be used as an auxiliary tool in selection programs. the objective of this work was to identify qtl associated with tick resistance/susceptibility in a bovine f <dig> population derived from the gyr  × holstein  cross.


RESULTS
through a whole genome scan with microsatellite markers, we were able to map six genomic regions associated with bovine tick resistance. for most qtl, we have found that depending on the tick evaluation season  different sets of genes could be involved in the resistance mechanism. we identified dry season specific qtl on bta  <dig> and  <dig>  rainy season specific qtl on bta  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  we also found a highly significant genome wide qtl for both dry and rainy seasons in the central region of bta  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the experimental f <dig> population derived from gyr × holstein cross successfully allowed the identification of six highly significant qtl associated with tick resistance in cattle. qtl located on bta  <dig> might be related with the bovine histocompatibility complex. further investigation of these qtl will help to isolate candidate genes involved with tick resistance in cattle.
