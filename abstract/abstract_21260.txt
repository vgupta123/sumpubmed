BACKGROUND
the human genome contains  <dig> clade b serpin genes at two loci, 6p <dig> and 18q <dig>  the three genes at 6p <dig> all conform to a 7-exon gene structure with conserved intron positioning and phasing, however, at 18q <dig> there are two 7-exon genes and eight genes with an additional exon yielding an 8-exon structure. currently, it is not known how these two loci evolved, nor which gene structure arose first â€“ did the 8-exon genes gain an exon, or did the 7-exon genes lose one? here we use the genomes of diverse vertebrate species to plot the emergence of clade b serpin genes and to identify the point at which the two genomic structures arose.


RESULTS
analysis of the chicken genome indicated the presence of a single clade b serpin gene locus, containing orthologues of both human loci and both genomic structures. the frog genome and the genomes of three fish species presented progressively simpler loci, although only the 7-exon structure could be identified. the serpinb <dig> gene contains seven exons in the frog genome, but eight exons in chickens and humans, indicating that the additional exon evolved in this gene.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose a new model for clade b serpin evolution from a single 7-exon gene . an additional exon was gained in the serpinb <dig> gene between the tetrapoda and amniota radiations to produce the 8-exon structure. both structures were then duplicated at a single locus until a chromosomal breakage occurred at some point along the mammalian lineage resulting in the two modern loci.
