BACKGROUND
one of the challenges in insect chemical ecology is to understand how insect pheromones are synthesised, detected and degraded. genome wide survey by comparative sequencing and gene specific expression profiling provide rich resources for this challenge. a. ipsilon is a destructive pest of many crops and further characterization of the genes involved in pheromone biosynthesis and transport could offer potential targets for disruption of their chemical communication and for crop protection.


RESULTS
here we report  <dig> next-generation sequencing of the a. ipsilon pheromone gland transcriptome, identification and expression profiling of genes putatively involved in pheromone production, transport and degradation. a total of  <dig> unigenes were obtained from the transcriptome analysis, 86% of which were a. ipsilon specific.  <dig> transcripts encoded enzymes putatively involved in pheromone biosynthesis, of which  <dig> were specifically, or mainly, expressed in the pheromone glands at  <dig> to 120-fold higher levels than in the body. two transcripts encoding for a fatty acid synthase and a desaturase were highly abundant in the transcriptome and expressed more than 40-fold higher in the glands than in the body. the transcripts encoding for  <dig> acetyl-coa carboxylases,  <dig> fatty acid synthase,  <dig> desaturases,  <dig> acyl-coa reductases,  <dig> alcohol oxidases,  <dig> aldehyde reductases and  <dig> acetyltransferases were expressed at a significantly higher level in the pheromone glands than in the body.  <dig> esterase transcripts were not gland-specific and  <dig> of these were expressed highly in the antennae. seven transcripts encoding odorant binding proteins  and  <dig> encoding chemosensory proteins  were identified. two csp transcripts  were highly abundant in the pheromone gland transcriptome and this was confirmed by qrt-pcr. one obp  were pheromone gland-enriched and three obps  were antennal-enriched. based on these studies we proposed possible a. ipsilon biosynthesis pathways for major and minor sex pheromone components.


CONCLUSIONS
our study identified genes potentially involved in sex pheromone biosynthesis and transport in a. ipsilon. the identified genes are likely to play essential roles in sex pheromone production, transport and degradation and could serve as targets to interfere with pheromone release. the identification of highly expressed csps and obps in the pheromone gland suggests that they may play a role in the binding, transport and release of sex pheromones during sex pheromone production in a. ipsilon and other lepidoptera insects.
