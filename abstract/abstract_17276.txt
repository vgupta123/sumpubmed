BACKGROUND
starch is the most important carbohydrate in plant storage tissues. multiple isozymes in at least four enzyme classes are involved in starch biosynthesis. some of these isozymes are thought to interact and form complexes for efficient starch biosynthesis. of these enzyme classes, starch synthases  and branching enzymes  play particularly central roles.


RESULTS
we generated double mutant lines  between ssi  and bei or beiib  to explore the relationships among these isozymes. the seed weight of ss1/be <dig> was comparable to that of wild type, although most ss1/be2b seeds were sterile and no double recessive plants were obtained. the seed weight of the double recessive mutant line ss1
l
/be2b, derived from the leaky ss <dig> mutant  and be2b, was higher than that of the single be2b mutant. analyses of the chain-length distribution of amylopectin in ss1/be <dig> endosperm revealed additive effects of ssi and bei on amylopectin structure. chain-length analysis indicated that the beiib deficiency significantly reduced the ratio of short chains in amylopectin of ss1
l
/be2b. the amylose content of endosperm starch of ss1/be <dig> and ss1
l
/be2b was almost the same as that of wild type, whereas the endosperm starch of be2b contained more amylose than did that of wild type. ssi, bei, and beiib deficiency also affected the extent of binding of other isozymes to starch granules.


CONCLUSIONS
analysis of the chain-length distribution in amylopectin of the double mutant lines showed that ssi and bei or beiib primarily function independently, and branching by beiib is followed by ssi chain elongation. the increased amylose content in be2b was because of reduced amylopectin biosynthesis; however, the lower ssi activity in this background may have enhanced amylopectin biosynthesis as a result of a correction of imbalance between the branching and elongation found in the single mutant. the fact that a deficiency of ssi, bei, or beiib affected the affinity of other starch biosynthetic isozymes for the starch granule implies that there is a close interaction among ssi, bei and beiib during amylopectin biosynthesis in rice endosperm.
