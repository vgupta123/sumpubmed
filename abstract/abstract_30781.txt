BACKGROUND
during egfr internalization cin <dig> bridges egfr-cbl complex, endocytic machinery and fusible membrane through the interactions of cin <dig> with c-cbl, endophilins and phosphatidic acid. these protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions are mediated or regulated by the positively charged c-terminal coiled-coil domain of cin <dig>  however, the details of cin85-lipid interaction remain unknown. the present study suggested a possible electric interaction between the negative charge of phosphatidic acid and the positive charge of basic amino acids in coiled-coil domain.


RESULTS
mutations of the basic amino acids in the coiled-coil domain, especially k <dig>  k <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig>  into neutral amino acid alanine completely blocked the interaction of cin <dig> with c-cbl or phosphatidic acid. however, they did not affect cin85-endophilin interaction. in addition, cin <dig> was found to associate with the internalized egfr endosomes. it interacted with several escrt  component proteins for escrt assembly on endosomal membrane. mutations in the coiled-coil domain  dissociated cin <dig> from endosomes. these mutants bound the escrt components in cytoplasm to prevent them from assembly on endosomal membrane and inhibited egfr sorting for degradation.


CONCLUSIONS
as an adaptor protein, cin <dig> interacts with variety of partners through several domains. the positive charges of basic amino acids in the coiled-coil domain are not only involved in the interaction with phosphatidic acid, but also regulate the interaction of cin <dig> with c-cbl. cin <dig> also interacts with escrt components for protein sorting in endosomes. these cin85-protein and cin85-lipid interactions enable cin <dig> to link egfr-cbl endocytic complex with fusible membrane during egfr endocytosis and subsequently to facilitate escrt formation on endosomal membrane for egfr sorting and degradation.
