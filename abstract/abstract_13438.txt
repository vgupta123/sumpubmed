BACKGROUND
successful realization of a "systems biology" approach to analyzing cells is a grand challenge for our understanding of life. however, current modeling approaches to cell simulation are labor-intensive, manual affairs, and therefore constitute a major bottleneck in the evolution of computational cell biology.


RESULTS
we developed the genome-based modeling  system for the purpose of automatically prototyping simulation models of cell-wide metabolic pathways from genome sequences and other public biological information. models generated by the gem system include an entire escherichia coli metabolism model comprising  <dig> reactions of  <dig> metabolites, achieving 100% coverage when compared with the kegg database,  <dig> % with the ecocyc database, and  <dig> % with ijr <dig> genome-scale model.


CONCLUSIONS
the gem system prototypes qualitative models to reduce the labor-intensive tasks required for systems biology research. models of over  <dig> bacterial genomes are available at our web site.
