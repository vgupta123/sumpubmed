BACKGROUND
chronic eosinophilic pneumonia  or eosinophilic gastroenteritis , or both, with asthma precede the onset of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis  in half of all egpa patients. it is not known what determines whether patients with cep or with eg following asthma will develop egpa.

methods
we studied  <dig> egpa patients and  <dig> patients with cep but without egpa. we assayed serum icam- <dig>  vcam- <dig>  and vegf, and the percentage of peripheral blood cd4+ t cells producing il- <dig> , at both onset and remission. we also examined the numbers of submucosal eosinophils and the basement membrane-to-crypt and crypt-to-crypt distance to evaluate edema in the colon submucosa at onset and remission in egpa and at onset in cep.


RESULTS
nine of  <dig>  cep patients had symptoms or endoscopic findings. colonic submucosal eosinophil counts and edema in egpa at onset were greater than at remission or in cep at onset. th <dig> cells  and serum icam- <dig> levels at onset were greater in egpa than in cep. in egpa, peripheral blood th <dig> cells  were significantly correlated with serum icam- <dig> level, colonic submucosal eosinophil count, and degree of edematous change; inversely correlated with serum vegf level; but not correlated with vcam- <dig> level.


CONCLUSIONS
eosinophilia and colonic submucosal edematous change were greater in egpa than in cep. the mechanism of vasculitis in egpa appears related to increases in serum th <dig> cell numbers and icam- <dig> levels and decreases in vegf levels.
