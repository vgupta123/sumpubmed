BACKGROUND
despite of the fact that mammalian genomes are far more spacious than prokaryotic genomes, recent nucleotide sequencing data have revealed that many mammalian genes are arranged in a head-to-head orientation and separated by a small intergenic sequence. extensive studies on some of these neighboring genes, in particular homologous gene pairs, have shown that these genes are often co-expressed in a symmetric manner and regulated by a shared promoter region. here we report the identification of two non-homologous brain disease-related genes, with one coding for a serine protease inhibitor  and the other for a programmed cell death-related gene , being tightly linked together by an asymmetric bidirectional promoter in an evolutionarily conserved fashion. this asymmetric bidirectional promoter, in cooperation with some cis-acting elements, is responsible for the co-regulation of the gene expression pattern as well as the tissue specificity of serpini <dig> and pdcd <dig> 


RESULTS
while serpini <dig> is predominantly expressed in normal brain and down-regulated in brain tumors, pdcd <dig> is ubiquitously expressed in all normal tissues but its gene transcription becomes aberrant in different types of cancers. by measuring the luciferase activity in various cell lysates, their 851-bp intergenic sequence was shown to be capable of driving the reporter gene expression in either direction. a 175-bp fragment from nt  <dig> to  <dig> in the vicinity of pdcd <dig> was further determined to function as a minimal bidirectional promoter. a critical regulatory fragment, from nt 176- <dig> outside the minimal promoter in the intergenic region, was identified to contain a strong repressive element for serpini <dig> and an enhancer for pdcd <dig>  these cis-acting elements may exist to help coordinate the expression and regulation of the two flanking genes.


CONCLUSIONS
for all non-homologous genes that have been described to be closely adjacent in the mammalian genomes, the intergenic region of the head-to-head pdcd10-serpini <dig> gene pair provides an interesting and informative example of a complex regulatory system that governs the expression of both genes not only through an asymmetric bidirectional promoter, but also through fine-tuned regulations with some cis-acting elements.
