BACKGROUND
the nematode c. briggsae serves as a useful model organism for comparative analysis of developmental and behavioral processes. the amenability of c. briggsae to genetic manipulations and the availability of its genome sequence have prompted researchers to study evolutionary changes in gene function and signaling pathways. these studies rely on the availability of forward genetic tools such as mutants and mapping markers.


RESULTS
we have computationally identified more than  <dig>  polymorphisms  in c. briggsae strains af <dig> and hk <dig>  these include  <dig>  snps that change restriction enzyme recognition sites  and  <dig> indels that range between  <dig> bp and  <dig> kb. we established bulk segregant and single animal-based pcr assay conditions and used these to test  <dig> polymorphisms. a total of  <dig> polymorphisms, consisting of  <dig> snip-snps and  <dig> indels, were experimentally confirmed with an overall success rate of 83%. the utility of polymorphisms in genetic studies was demonstrated by successful mapping of  <dig> mutations, including  <dig> that were localized to sub-chromosomal regions. our mapping experiments have also revealed one case of a misassembled contig on chromosome  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we report a comprehensive set of polymorphisms in c. briggsae wild-type strains and demonstrate their use in mapping mutations. we also show that molecular markers can be useful tools to improve the c. briggsae genome sequence assembly. our polymorphism resource promises to accelerate genetic and functional studies of c. briggsae genes.
