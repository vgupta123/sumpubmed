BACKGROUND
oral bovine colostrum prophylaxis accelerates the recovery of dextran sulfate sodium -induced colitis. in the present study the beneficial effects on acute intestinal inflammation of two major colostral components, secretory immunoglobulin a and lactoferrin, were investigated. outbred nmri mice received whole bovine colostrum , colostral bovine lactoferrin , or secretory immunoglobulin a  daily by oral gavage, either two weeks before induction of colitis  or after disease establishment . bovine serum albumin  and immunoglobulin g  served as protein controls. colitis was induced by providing 5% dss solution ad libitum for seven days.


RESULTS
compared to bsa, bc therapy improved occult blood, stool consistency, and clinical recovery from colitis but did not prevent initial weight loss. in contrast, administration of blf did not influence the course of colitis in either the prophylactic or the therapeutic setting. therapeutic application of siga promoted weight gain in the recovery phase of colitis but failed to improve other clinical parameters. prophylactically-fed siga influenced immune cell redistribution, normalized peripheral blood cd11c+cd83+ mature dendritic cells, modulated colonic immune cell infiltration, and altered the numbers of both dss-induced regulatory γδ tcr+ t cells and cd11b+gr-1+ myeloid suppressor cells in the lymph nodes and spleens of mice.


CONCLUSIONS
these data demonstrated the potential of colostrum in disease recovery and epithelial homeostasis following intestinal injury. colostral siga failed to improve acute disease activity but promoted weight gain and modulated immune cell responses that are involved in the genesis of colitis.
