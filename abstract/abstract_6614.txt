BACKGROUND
cercospora leaf spot disease, caused by the fungus cercospora beticola, is the most destructive foliar disease of sugar beets  worldwide. cercosporin, a light-inducible toxin, is essential for necrosis of the leaf tissue and development of the typical leaf spots on sugar beet leaves.


RESULTS
in this study we show that the o-methyltransferase gene ctb <dig> is essential for cercosporin production and pathogenicity in two c. beticola isolates. we established a transformation system for c. beticola protoplasts, disrupted ctb <dig>  and transformed the Δctb <dig> strains as well as a wild type strain with the dsred reporter gene. the Δctb <dig> strains had lost their pigmentation and toxin measurements demonstrated that the Δctb <dig> strains were defective in cercosporin production. infection of sugar beets with the wild type and Δctb <dig> dsred strains showed that the deletion strain was severely impaired in plant infection. histological analysis revealed that the ctb2-deficient isolate cannot enter the leaf tissue through stomata like the wild type.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these observations indicate that cercosporin has a dual function in sugar beet infection: in addition to the well-known role in tissue necrosis, the toxin is required for the early phase of sugar beet infection.
