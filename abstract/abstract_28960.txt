BACKGROUND
conjugation of the ubiquitin-like modifier nedd <dig> to cullins is critical for the function of scf-type ubiquitin ligases and thus facilitates ubiquitin conjugation and ultimately degradation of scf substrates, including several cell cycle regulators. like ubiquitin, nedd <dig> is produced as a precursor that must first be processed before it becomes active. in saccharomyces cerevisiae this is carried out exclusively by the enzyme yuh <dig> 


RESULTS
here we show that in the fission yeast, schizosaccharomyces pombe, the yuh <dig> orthologue, uch <dig>  is not the sole nedd <dig> processing enzyme. instead it appears that deubiquitylating enzymes can efficiently process the nedd <dig> precursor in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
several enzymes contribute to nedd <dig> precursor processing including a number of deubiquitylating enzymes.
