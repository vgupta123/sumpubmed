BACKGROUND
although short interfering rna  has been widely used for studying gene functions in mammalian cells, its gene silencing efficacy varies markedly and there are only a few consistencies among the recently reported design rules/guidelines for selecting sirna sequences effective for mammalian genes. another shortcoming of the previously reported methods is that they cannot estimate the probability that a candidate sequence will silence the target gene.


RESULTS
we propose two prediction methods for selecting effective sirna target sequences from many possible candidate sequences, one based on the supervised learning of a radial basis function  network and other based on decision tree learning. they are quite different from the previous score-based sirna design techniques and can predict the probability that a candidate sirna sequence will be effective. the proposed methods were evaluated by applying them to recently reported effective and ineffective sirna sequences for various genes . we also propose the combined prediction method of the rbf network and decision tree learning. as the average prediction probabilities of gene silencing for the effective and ineffective sirna sequences of the reported genes by the proposed three methods were respectively 65% and 32%,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, and  <dig> % and  <dig> %, the methods imply high estimation accuracy for selecting candidate sirna sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
new prediction methods were presented for selecting effective sirna sequences. as the proposed methods indicated high estimation accuracy for selecting candidate sirna sequences, they would be useful for many other genes.
