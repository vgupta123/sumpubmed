BACKGROUND
development of computational tools that can accurately predict presence and location of b-cell epitopes on pathogenic proteins has a valuable application to the field of vaccinology. because of the highly variable yet enigmatic nature of b-cell epitopes, their prediction presents a great challenge to computational immunologists.

methods
we propose a method, beepro , which adapts a linear averaging scheme on  <dig> properties using a support vector machine model to predict both linear and conformational b-cell epitopes. these  <dig> properties include position specific scoring matrix , an amino acid ratio scale, and a set of  <dig> physicochemical scales obtained via a feature selection process. finally, a three-way data split procedure is used during the validation process to prevent over-estimation of prediction performance and avoid bias in our experiment results.


RESULTS
in our experiment, first we use a non-redundant linear b-cell epitope dataset curated by sollner et al. for feature selection and parameter optimization. evaluated by a three-way data split procedure, beepro achieves significant improvement with the area under the receiver operating curve  =  <dig> , accuracy =  <dig> %, mathew's correlation coefficient  =  <dig> , sensitivity =  <dig> , specificity =  <dig> , positive predictive value  =  <dig>  for the sollner dataset. in addition, the same parameters are used to evaluate performance on other independent linear b-cell epitope test datasets, beepro attains an auc which ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and an accuracy which ranges from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. moreover, five-fold cross-validation on one benchmark conformational b-cell epitope dataset yields an accuracy of  <dig> % and auc of  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
compared with other current models, our method achieves a significant improvement with respect to auc, accuracy, mcc, sensitivity, specificity, and ppv. thus, we have shown that an appropriate combination of evolutionary information and propensity scales with a support vector machine model can significantly enhance the prediction performance of both linear and conformational b-cell epitopes.
