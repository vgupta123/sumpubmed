BACKGROUND
the mannose receptor  is an endocytic receptor of mÏ† and endothelial cell subsets whose natural ligands include both self glycoproteins and microbial glycans. it is also expressed by immature cultured dendritic cells , where it mediates high efficiency uptake of glycosylated antigens, yet its role in antigen handling in vivo is unknown. knowledge of which apc subsets express mr will assist the design of experiments to address its immunological functions. here the expression of mr by mhc class ii positive apc in non-lymphoid organs of the mouse is described.


RESULTS
mr positive apc were identified in several peripheral organs: skin, liver, cardiac and skeletal muscle and tongue. mr positive cells in salivary gland, thyroid and pancreas coexpressed mhc class ii and the myeloid markers macrosialin and sialoadhesin, but not the dendritic cell markers cd11c or dec- <dig>  mr and mhc class ii colocalised in confocal microscope images, implying that antigen capture may be the primary role of mr in these cells. distinct ligands of mr were found in salivary gland and pancreas tissue lysates that are candidate physiological ligands of mr positive apc in these organs.


CONCLUSIONS
the tissue and subcellular distribution of mr suggest it is appropriately located to serve as a high efficiency antigen uptake receptor of apc.
