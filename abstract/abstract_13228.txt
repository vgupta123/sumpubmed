BACKGROUND
the callipyge mutation is located within an imprinted gene cluster on ovine chromosome  <dig>  the callipyge trait exhibits polar overdominant inheritance due to the fact that only heterozygotes inheriting a mutant paternal allele  have a phenotype of muscle hypertrophy, reduced fat and a more compact skeleton. the mutation is a single a to g transition in an intergenic region that results in the increased expression of several genes within the imprinted cluster without changing their parent-of-origin allele-specific expression.


RESULTS
there was a significant effect of genotype  on the transcript abundance of dlk <dig>  peg <dig>  and meg <dig> in the muscles of lambs with the callipyge allele. dlk <dig> and peg <dig> transcript levels were elevated in the hypertrophied muscles of paternal heterozygous animals relative to animals of the other three genotypes. the peg <dig> locus produces a single  <dig>  kb transcript and two smaller antisense strand transcripts, referred to as peg11as, in skeletal muscle. peg11as transcripts were detectable over a  <dig>  kb region beginning  <dig>  kb upstream of the peg <dig> start codon and spanning the entire open reading frame. analysis of peg <dig> expression by quantitative pcr shows a 200-fold induction in the hypertrophied muscles of paternal heterozygous animals and a 13-fold induction in homozygous callipyge animals. peg <dig> transcripts were 14-fold more abundant than peg11as transcripts in the gluteus medius of paternal heterozygous animals. peg11as transcripts were expressed at higher levels than peg <dig> transcripts in the gluteus medius of animals of the other three genotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
the effect of the callipyge mutation has been to alter the expression of dlk <dig>  gtl <dig>  peg <dig> and meg <dig> in the hypertrophied skeletal muscles. transcript abundance of dlk <dig> and peg <dig> was highest in paternal heterozygous animals and exhibited polar overdominant gene expression patterns; therefore, both genes are candidates for causing skeletal muscle hypertrophy. there was unique relationship of peg <dig> and peg11as transcript abundance in the paternal heterozygous animals that suggests a rna interference mechanism may have a role in peg <dig> gene regulation and polar overdominance in callipyge sheep.
