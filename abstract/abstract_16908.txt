BACKGROUND
mammalian olfactory receptors  are encoded by the largest mammalian multigene family. understanding the or gene repertoire in the cattle genome could lead to link the effects of genetic differences in these genes to variations in olfaction in cattle.


RESULTS
we report here a whole genome analysis of the olfactory receptor genes of bos taurus using conserved or gene-specific motifs and known or protein sequences from diverse species. our analysis, using the current cattle genome assembly umd  <dig>  covering  <dig> % of the cattle genome, shows that the cattle genome contains  <dig>  or-related sequences including  <dig> functional,  <dig> pseudo, and  <dig> partial or sequences. the or genes are located in  <dig> clusters on  <dig> cattle chromosomes. we classified them into  <dig> families consisting of  <dig> class i and  <dig> class ii families and these were further grouped into  <dig> subfamilies. comparative analyses of the or genes of cattle, pigs, humans, mice, and dogs showed that  <dig> %  of functional or cattle genes were species-specific. we also showed that significant copy number variations are present in the or repertoire of the cattle from the analysis of  <dig> selected or genes.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis revealed the almost complete or gene repertoire from an individual cattle genome. though the number of or genes were lower than in pigs, the analysis of the genetic system of cattle ors showed close similarities to that of the pig.
