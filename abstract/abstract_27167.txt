BACKGROUND
equine melanoma has a high incidence in grey horses. xenogenic dna vaccination may represent a promising therapeutic approach against equine melanoma as it successfully induced an immunological response in other species suffering from melanoma and in healthy horses. in a clinical study, twenty-seven, grey, melanoma-bearing, horses were assigned to three groups  and vaccinated on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> with dna vectors encoding for equine  il- <dig> and il- <dig> alone or in combination with either human glycoprotein   <dig> or human tyrosinase . horses were vaccinated intramuscularly, and one selected melanoma was locally treated by intradermal peritumoral injection. prior to each injection and on day  <dig>  the sizes of up to nine melanoma lesions per horse were measured by caliper and ultrasound. specific serum antibodies against hgp <dig> and htyr were measured using cell based flow-cytometric assays. an analysis of variance  for repeated measurements was performed to identify statistically significant influences on the relative tumor volume. for post-hoc testing a tukey-kramer multiple-comparison test was performed to compare the relative volumes on the different examination days. an anova for repeated measurements was performed to analyse changes in body temperature over time. a one-way anova was used to evaluate differences in body temperature between the groups. a p–value <  <dig>  was considered significant for all statistical tests applied.


RESULTS
in all groups, the relative tumor volume decreased significantly to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % by day  <dig> . affiliation to treatment group, local treatment and examination modality had no significant influence on the results . neither a cellular nor a humoral immune response directed against htyr or hgp <dig> was detected. horses had an increased body temperature on the day after vaccination.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first clinical report on a systemic effect against equine melanoma following treatment with dna vectors encoding eqil <dig> and eqil <dig> and formulated with a transfection reagent. addition of dna vectors encoding hgp <dig> respectively htyr did not potentiate this effect.
