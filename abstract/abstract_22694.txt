BACKGROUND
simple peak-picking algorithms, such as those based on lineshape fitting, perform well when peaks are completely resolved in multidimensional nmr spectra, but often produce wrong intensities and frequencies for overlapping peak clusters. for example, noesy-type spectra have considerable overlaps leading to significant peak-picking intensity errors, which can result in erroneous structural restraints. precise frequencies are critical for unambiguous resonance assignments.


RESULTS
to alleviate this problem, a more sophisticated peaks decomposition algorithm, based on non-negative matrix factorization , was developed. we produce peak shapes from fourier-transformed nmr spectra. apart from its main goal of deriving components from spectra and producing peak lists automatically, the nmf approach can also be applied if the positions of some peaks are known a priori, e.g. from consistently referenced spectral dimensions of other experiments.


CONCLUSIONS
application of the nmf algorithm to a three-dimensional peak list of the  <dig> kda bi-domain section of the rcsd protein  as well as to synthetic hsqc data shows that peaks can be picked accurately also in spectral regions with strong overlap.
