BACKGROUND
t lymphocytes are orchestrators of adaptive immunity. naïve t cells may differentiate into th <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig> or itreg phenotypes, depending on environmental co-stimulatory signals. to identify genes and pathways involved in differentiation of jurkat t cells towards th <dig> and th <dig> subtypes we performed comprehensive transcriptome analyses of jurkat t cells stimulated with various stimuli and pathway inhibitors. results from these experiments were validated in a human experimental setting using whole blood and purified cd4+ tcells.


RESULTS
calcium-dependent activation of t cells using cd3/cd <dig> and pma/cd <dig> stimulation induced a th <dig> expression profile reflected by increased expression of t-bet, runx <dig>  il- <dig>  and ifnγ, whereas calcium-independent activation via pma/cd <dig> induced a th <dig> expression profile which included gata <dig>  rxra, ccl <dig> and itk. knock down with sirna and gene expression profiling in the presence of selective kinase inhibitors showed that proximal kinases lck and pkcθ are crucial signaling hubs during t helper cell activation, revealing a clear role for lck in th <dig> development and for pkcθ in both th <dig> and th <dig> development. medial signaling via mapkinases appeared to be less important in these pathways, since specific inhibitors of these kinases displayed a minor effect on gene expression. translation towards a primary, whole blood setting and purified human cd4+ t cells revealed that pma/cd <dig> stimulation induced a more pronounced th <dig> specific, lck and pkcθ dependent ifnγ production, whereas pma/cd <dig> induced th <dig> specific il- <dig> and il- <dig> production, independent of lck activation. pma/cd3-mediated skewing towards a th <dig> phenotype was also reflected in mrna expression of the master transcription factor tbet, whereas pma/cd28-mediated stimulation enhanced gata <dig> mrna expression in primary human cd4+ tcells.


CONCLUSIONS
this study identifies stimulatory pathways and gene expression profiles for in vitro skewing of t helper cell activation. pma/cd <dig> stimulation enhances a th1-like response in an lck and pkcθ dependent fashion, whereas pma/cd <dig> stimulation results in a th2-like phenotype independent of the proximal tcr-tyrosine kinase lck. this approach offers a robust and fast translational in vitro system for skewed t helper cell responses in jurkat t cells, primary human cd4+ tcells and in a more complex matrix such as human whole blood.
