BACKGROUND
the ovulatory surge of gonadotropins triggers oocyte maturation and rupture of the ovarian follicle. the resumption of nuclear maturation in the oocyte from the prophase stage is characterized by germinal vesicle breakdown . it has previously been shown that specific inhibition of camp degradation by pde <dig> prevents the resumption of oocyte meiosis. however, no report has characterized the activity of pde <dig> in the porcine oocyte, or the implication of the camp-pde <dig> pathway in the entire nuclear maturation process. in this study, pde <dig> activity in the oocyte was assessed during in vitro maturation  and the possible roles of the camp-pde <dig> pathway in the resumption and progression of meiosis were investigated in terms of different models of oocyte maturation.


RESULTS
cyclic amp-degrading pde activity was detected in the cumulus-oocyte complex  and was partially inhibited by a specific pde <dig> inhibitor, cilostamide. when measured only in the denuded oocyte, pde activity was almost completely inhibited by cilostamide, suggesting that camp-pde <dig> activity is the major camp-pde in porcine oocytes. pde3a mrna was detected by rt-pcr. pde <dig> activity did not vary significantly during the early hours of ivm, but a maximum was observed at  <dig> hours. in cumulus-oocyte complexes, meiosis resumed after  <dig>  hours of culture. pde <dig> inhibition no longer maintained meiotic arrest if sustained beyond  <dig>  hours of ivm,  <dig> hours prior to resumption of meiosis. thereafter, pde <dig> inhibition progressively lost its efficacy in gvbd. when the protein phosphatase  <dig> and 2a inhibitor okadaic acid was continuously or transiently  present during ivm, meiosis resumed prematurely; pde <dig> inhibition was unable to prevent gvbd. however, pde <dig> inhibition in coc treated with oa for  <dig> hours significantly delayed meiosis at the intermediate stage.


CONCLUSIONS
the present investigation has demonstrated that pde3a is the major camp-degrading pde in the oocyte. it regulates the resumption of meiosis until  <dig> hours prior to gvbd and transiently affects meiotic progression.
