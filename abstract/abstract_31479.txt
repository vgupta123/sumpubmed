BACKGROUND
studies regarding coxsackievirus  tend to focus on epidemic outbreaks, an imbalanced topology is considered to be an indication of acute infection with partial cross-immunity. in enteroviruses, a clear understanding of the characteristics of tree topology, transmission, and its demographic dynamics in viral succession and circulation are essential for identifying prevalence trends in endemic pathogens such as coxsackievirus b <dig> . this study applied a novel bayesian evolutionary approach to elucidate the phylodynamic characteristics of cv-b <dig>  a dataset containing  <dig> vp <dig> sequences and a dataset containing  <dig> partial 3dpol sequencing were analyzed, where each dataset included taiwan sequences isolated during 1988– <dig> 


RESULTS
four and five genotypes were determined based on the 846-nucleotide vp <dig> and 441-nucleotide 3dpol  regions, respectively, with spatiotemporally structured topologies in both trees. some strains with tree discordance indicated the occurrence of recombination in the region between the vp <dig> and 3dpol genes. the similarities of vp <dig> and 3dpol gene were  <dig>  %– <dig>  % and  <dig>  %– <dig>  %, respectively. analyses of population dynamics using vp <dig> dataset indicated that the endemic cv-b <dig> has a small effective population size. the balance indices, high similarity, and low evolutionary rate in the vp <dig> region indicated mild herd immunity selection in the major capsid region.


CONCLUSIONS
phylodynamic analysis can reveal demographic trends and herd immunity in endemic pathogens.
