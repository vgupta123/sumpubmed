BACKGROUND
fungal and animal mitochondrial genomes typically have one trna for each synonymous codon family. the codon-anticodon adaptation hypothesis predicts that the wobble nucleotide of a trna anticodon should evolve towards maximizing watson-crick base pairing with the most frequently used codon within each synonymous codon family, whereas the wobble versatility hypothesis argues that the nucleotide at the wobble site should be occupied by a nucleotide most versatile in wobble pairing, i.e., the trna wobble nucleotide should be g for nny codon families, and u for nnr and nnn codon families .


RESULTS
we here integrate these two traditional hypotheses on trna anticodons into a unified model based on an analysis of the wobble costs associated with different wobble base pairs. this novel approach allows the relative cost of wobble pairing to be qualitatively evaluated. a comprehensive study of  <dig> fungal genomes suggests very different costs between two kinds of u:g wobble pairs, i.e.,  between a g at the wobble site of a trna anticodon and a u at the third codon position  and  between a u at the wobble site of a trna anticodon and a g at the third codon position .


CONCLUSIONS
in general, mu3:g is much smaller than mg3:u, suggesting no selection against u-ending codons in nny codon families with a wobble g in the trna anticodon but strong selection against g-ending codons in nnr codon families with a wobble u at the trna anticodon. this finding resolves several puzzling observations in fungal genomics and corroborates previous studies showing that u3:g wobble is energetically more favorable than g3:u wobble.
