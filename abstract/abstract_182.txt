BACKGROUND
ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides  are a diverse group of biologically active bacterial molecules. due to the conserved genomic arrangement of many of the genes involved in their synthesis, these secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways can be predicted from genome sequence data. to date, however, despite the myriad of sequenced genomes covering many branches of the bacterial phylogenetic tree, such an analysis for a broader group of bacteria like anaerobes has not been attempted.


RESULTS
we investigated a collection of  <dig> complete and published genomes, focusing on anaerobic bacteria, whose potential to encode ripps is relatively unknown. we showed that the presence of ripp-genes is widespread among anaerobic representatives of the phyla actinobacteria, proteobacteria and firmicutes and that, collectively, anaerobes possess the ability to synthesize a broad variety of different ripp classes. more than 25% of anaerobes are capable of producing ripps either alone or in conjunction with other secondary metabolites, such as polyketides or non-ribosomal peptides.


CONCLUSIONS
amongst the analyzed genomes, several gene clusters encode uncharacterized ripps, whilst others show similarity with known ripps. these include a number of potential class ii lanthipeptides; head-to-tail cyclized peptides and lactococcin 972-like ripp. this study presents further evidence in support of anaerobic bacteria as an untapped natural products reservoir.
