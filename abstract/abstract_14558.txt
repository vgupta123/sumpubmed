BACKGROUND
there are two selenophosphate synthetases  in higher eukaryotes, sps <dig> and sps <dig>  of these two isotypes, only sps <dig> catalyzes selenophosphate synthesis. although sps <dig> does not contain selenophosphate synthesis activity, it was found to be essential for cell growth and embryogenesis in drosophila. the function of sps <dig>  however, has not been elucidated.


RESULTS
differentially expressed genes in drosophila sl <dig> cells were identified using two-way analysis of variance methods and clustered according to their temporal expression pattern. gene ontology analysis was performed against differentially expressed genes and gene ontology terms related to vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis were found to be significantly affected at the early stage at which megamitochondria were not formed  after sps <dig> knockdown. interestingly, genes related to defense and amino acid metabolism were affected at a later stage  following knockdown. levels of pyridoxal phosphate, an active form of vitamin b <dig>  were decreased by sps <dig> knockdown. treatment of sl <dig> cells with an inhibitor of pyridoxal phosphate synthesis resulted in both a similar pattern of expression as that found by sps <dig> knockdown and the formation of megamitochondria, the major phenotypic change observed by sps <dig> knockdown.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that sps <dig> regulates vitamin b <dig> synthesis, which in turn impacts various cellular systems such as amino acid metabolism, defense and other important metabolic activities.
