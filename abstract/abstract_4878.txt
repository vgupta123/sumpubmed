BACKGROUND
the transcription factor yin yang  <dig>  shares a structural and functional highly homologue dna-binding domain with the ubiquitously expressed yy <dig> protein, which has been implicated in regulating fundamental biological processes. however, the biological relevance of yy <dig> has not been identified yet.


RESULTS
towards the understanding of yy <dig> biology, we analyzed in detail the expression pattern of yy <dig> in various organs during embryonic and postnatal mouse development till adulthood. thereby, a constant yy <dig> level was detected in heart and lung tissue, whereas in different brain regions yy <dig> expression was dynamically regulated. interestingly, in any analyzed tissue neither the homologue yy <dig> nor the mbtps <dig> gene showed changes in mrna expression levels like yy <dig>  although the intronless yy <dig> gene is located within the mbtps <dig> locus.

furthermore, we detected yy <dig>  yy <dig>  and mbtps <dig> mrna in primary mouse neurons, microglia cells, and astrocytes. in comparison to yy <dig> and mbtps <dig>  yy <dig> revealed the highest expression level in all cell types. again, only yy <dig> showed significantly altered gene expression levels among the cell types. higher yy <dig> expression levels were detected in microglia cells and astrocytes than in primary neurons.


CONCLUSIONS
yy <dig> expression in the heart and lung is constitutively expressed during embryogenesis and in adult mice. for the first time, developmental changes of yy <dig> transcription became obvious in various areas of the brain. this suggests that yy <dig> is involved in developmental gene regulation.
