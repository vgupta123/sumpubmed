BACKGROUND
sh <dig> containing lymphocyte protein  is a putative adapter protein exclusively expressed in lymphocytes which is involved in antigen receptor induced activation. we previously have generated sly1Δ/Δ mice harbouring a partial deletion in the n-terminal region of sly <dig> which revealed profound immunological defects in t and b cell functions.


RESULTS
in this study, t cell development in sly1-/- and sly1Δ/Δ mice was analysed ex vivo and upon cultivation with the bone marrow stromal cell line op <dig>  sly1-deficient thymocytes were compromised in inducing nutrient receptor expression and ribosomal protein s <dig> phosphorylation, indicating a defect in mtor complex activation. furthermore, sly <dig> was identified as a novel anti-apoptotic protein required for developmental progression of t cell precursors to the cd4+cd8+ double-positive stage by protecting from premature programmed cell death initiation in developing cd4-cd8- double-negative thymocytes. in addition, sly <dig> phosphorylation was differentially regulated upon notch ligand-mediated stimulation and expression of the pretcr.


CONCLUSIONS
thus, our results suggest a non-redundant role for sly <dig> in integrating signals from both receptors in early t cell progenitors in the thymus.
