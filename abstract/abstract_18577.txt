BACKGROUND
samples for diagnostic procedures often require some form of pre-analytical preparation for preservation or safe handling during transportation prior to analysis in the laboratory. this is particularly important for milk samples which frequently need preservatives to retain milk composition as close to that found in freshly collected samples as possible.

methods
milk samples were treated by heating at 56 °c for 30 min or preserved by addition of either potassium dichromate or bronopol respectively. haptoglobin , mammary associated serum amyloid a <dig>  and c-reactive protein  were measured in the various treatment groups and in control samples which were not treated, using enzyme linked immunoassays. the concentrations of each app were compared between treated and non-treated groups using the wilcoxon signed ranks tests.


RESULTS
heat treatment of samples was found to have a significant lowering effect on milk m-saa <dig> and crp but not hp. the use of potassium dichromate and bronopol as preservatives in milk had no significant effects on milk hp and m-saa <dig> concentration but lowered milk crp values compared to controls.


CONCLUSIONS
the observed effects of heating and preservative use on milk app should be taken into consideration when assaying samples which have undergone heat treatment as a result of international transfer regulations involving biological samples or samples needing chemical preservation prior to transport to laboratory.
