BACKGROUND
although the gene encoding for glutamine synthetase  is essential in several organisms, multiple glna copies have been identified in bacterial genomes such as those of the phylum actinobacteria, notably the mycobacterial species. intriguingly, previous reports have shown that only one copy  is essential for growth in m. tuberculosis, while the other copies  are not.


RESULTS
in this report it is shown that the glna <dig> and glna <dig> encoded glutamine synthetase sequences were inherited from an actinobacteria ancestor, while the glna <dig> and glna <dig> encoded gs sequences were sequentially acquired during actinobacteria speciation. the glutamine synthetase sequences encoded by glna <dig> and glna <dig> are undergoing reductive evolution in the mycobacteria, whilst those encoded by glna <dig> and glna <dig> are more conserved.


CONCLUSIONS
different selective pressures by the ecological niche that the organisms occupy may influence the sequence evolution of glna <dig> and glna <dig> and thereby affecting phylogenies based on the protein sequences they encode. the findings in this report may impact the use of similar sequences as molecular markers, as well as shed some light on the evolution of glutamine synthetase in the mycobacteria.
