BACKGROUND
immobilization of lipase on appropriate solid supports is one way to improve their stability and activity, and can be reused for large scale applications. a sample, cost- effective and high loading capacity method is still challenging.


RESULTS
a facile method of lipase immobilization was developed in this study, by the use of polydopamine coated magnetic nanoparticles . under optimal conditions,  <dig> % of the available lipase was immobilized on pd-mnps, yielding a lipase loading capacity as high as  <dig> mg/g. enzyme assays revealed that lipase immobilized on pd-mnps displayed enhanced ph and thermal stability compared to free lipase. furthermore, lipase immobilized on pd-mnps was easily isolated from the reaction medium by magnetic separation and retained more than 70% of initial activity after  <dig> repeated cycles of enzyme reaction followed by magnetic separation.


CONCLUSIONS
immobilization of enzyme onto magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles via poly-dopamine film is economical, facile and efficient.
