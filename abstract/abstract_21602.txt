BACKGROUND
spatio-temporal dynamics within cells can now be visualized at appropriate resolution, due to the advances in molecular imaging technologies. even single-particle tracking  and single fluorophore video imaging  are now being applied to observation of molecular-level dynamics. however, little is known concerning how molecular-level dynamics affect properties at the cellular level.


RESULTS
we propose an algorithm designed for three-dimensional simulation of the reaction-diffusion dynamics of molecules, based on a particle model. chemical reactions proceed through the interactions of particles in space, with activation energies determining the rates of these chemical reactions at each interaction. this energy-based model can include the cellular membrane, membranes of other organelles, and cytoskeleton. the simulation algorithm was tested for a reversible enzyme reaction model and its validity was confirmed. snapshot images taken from simulated molecular interactions on the cell-surface revealed clustering domains  associated with rafts. sample trajectories of raft constructs exhibited "hop diffusion". these domains corralled the diffusive motion of membrane proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings demonstrate that our approach is promising for modelling the localization properties of biological phenomena.
