BACKGROUND
t cell development occurs within the highly specialized thymus. cytotoxic cd <dig> t cells are critical in adaptive immunity by targeting virally infected or tumor cells. in this study, we addressed whether functional cd <dig> t cells can be generated fully in vitro using human umbilical cord blood  hematopoietic stem cells  in coculture with op9-dl <dig> cells.


RESULTS
hsc/op9-dl <dig> cocultures supported the differentiation of cd <dig> t cells, which were tcr/cd3hi cd27hi cd1aneg and thus phenotypically resembled mature functional cd <dig> single positive thymocytes. these in vitro-generated t cells also appeared to be conventional cd <dig> cells, as they expressed high levels of eomes and low levels of plzf, albeit not identical to ex vivo ucb cd <dig> t cells. consistent with the phenotypic and molecular characterization, upon tcr-stimulation, in vitro-generated cd <dig> t cells proliferated, expressed activation markers , secreted ifn-Î³ and expressed granzyme b, a cytotoxic t-cell effector molecule.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the ability to direct human hematopoietic stem cell or t-progenitor cells towards a mature functional phenotype raises the possibility of establishing cell-based treatments for t-immunodeficiencies by rapidly restoring cd <dig> effector function, thereby mitigating the risks associated with opportunistic infections.
