BACKGROUND
the adult plant stem rust resistance gene sr <dig> was introgressed into hexaploid wheat cultivar  marquis from tetraploid emmer wheat cv yaroslav, to generate stem rust resistant cv hope in the 1920s. subsequently, sr <dig> has been widely deployed and has provided durable partial resistance to all known races of puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici. this report describes the physical map of the sr2-carrying region on the short arm of chromosome 3b of cv hope and compares the hope haplotype with non-sr <dig> wheat cv chinese spring.


RESULTS
sr <dig> was located to a region of 867 kb on chromosome 3b in hope, which corresponded to a region of 567 kb in chinese spring. the hope sr <dig> region carried  <dig> putative genes but only  <dig> were annotated in the comparable region of chinese spring. the two haplotypes differed by extensive dna sequence polymorphisms between flanking markers as well as by a major insertion/deletion event including ten germin-like protein  genes in hope that were absent in chinese spring. haplotype analysis of a limited number of wheat genotypes of interest showed that all wheat genotypes carrying sr <dig> possessed the glp cluster; while, of those lacking sr <dig>  some, including marquis, possessed the cluster, while some lacked it. thus, this region represents a common presence-absence polymorphism in wheat, with presence of the cluster not correlated with presence of sr <dig>  comparison of hope and marquis glp genes on 3bs found no polymorphisms in the coding regions of the ten genes but several snps in the shared promoter of one divergently transcribed glp gene pair and a single snp downstream of the transcribed region of a second glp.


CONCLUSIONS
physical mapping and sequence comparison showed major haplotype divergence at the sr <dig> locus between hope and chinese spring. candidate genes within the sr <dig> region of hope are being evaluated for the ability to confer stem rust resistance. based on the detailed mapping and sequencing of the locus, we predict that sr <dig> does not belong to the nb-lrr gene family and is not related to previously cloned, race non-specific rust resistance genes lr <dig> and yr <dig>
