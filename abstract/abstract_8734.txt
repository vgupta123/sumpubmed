BACKGROUND
protein-protein interaction data used in the creation or prediction of molecular networks is usually obtained from large scale or high-throughput experiments. this experimental data is liable to contain a large number of spurious interactions. hence, there is a need to validate the interactions and filter out the incorrect data before using them in prediction studies.


RESULTS
in this study, we use a combination of  <dig> genomic features – structurally known interacting pfam domains, gene ontology annotations and sequence homology – as a means to assign reliability to the protein-protein interactions in saccharomyces cerevisiae determined by high-throughput experiments. using bayesian network approaches, we show that protein-protein interactions from high-throughput data supported by one or more genomic features have a higher likelihood ratio and hence are more likely to be real interactions. our method has a high sensitivity  and good specificity . we show that 56% of the interactions from high-throughput experiments in saccharomyces cerevisiae have high reliability. we use the method to estimate the number of true interactions in the high-throughput protein-protein interaction data sets in caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster and homo sapiens to be 27%, 18% and 68% respectively. our results are available for searching and downloading at .


CONCLUSIONS
a combination of genomic features that include sequence, structure and annotation information is a good predictor of true interactions in large and noisy high-throughput data sets. the method has a very high sensitivity and good specificity and can be used to assign a likelihood ratio, corresponding to the reliability, to each interaction.
