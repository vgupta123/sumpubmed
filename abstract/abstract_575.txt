BACKGROUND
codon decoding time is a fundamental property of mrna translation believed to affect the abundance, function, and properties of proteins. recently, a novel experimental technology--ribosome profiling--was developed to measure the density, and thus the speed, of ribosomes at codon resolution. specifically, this method is based on next-generation sequencing, which theoretically can provide footprint counts that correspond to the probability of observing a ribosome in this position for each nucleotide in each transcript.


RESULTS
in this study, we report for the first time various novel properties of the distribution of codon footprint counts in five organisms, based on large-scale analysis of ribosomal profiling data. we show that codons have distinctive footprint count distributions. these tend to be preserved along the inner part of the orf, but differ at the 5' and 3' ends of the orf, suggesting that the translation-elongation stage actually includes three biophysical sub-steps. in addition, we study various basic properties of the codon footprint count distributions and show that some of them correlate with the abundance of the trna molecule types recognizing them.


CONCLUSIONS
our approach emphasizes the advantages of analyzing ribosome profiling and similar types of data via a comparative genomic codon-distribution-centric view. thus, our methods can be used in future studies related to translation and even transcription elongation.
