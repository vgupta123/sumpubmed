BACKGROUND
prophages of enteric bacteria are frequently of key importance for the biology, virulence, or host adaptation of their host. some c. jejuni isolates carry homologs of the cjie <dig>  prophage that carry cargo genes potentially involved in virulence. possible role of cjie <dig> homologs in the biology and virulence of c. jejuni were therefore investigated by using in vitro cell culture assays and by assessing the association of c. jejuni isolates with and without these prophages with patientsâ€™ symptoms, with source, and with clonal lineages within the c. jejuni population.


RESULTS
four c. jejuni isolates, three carrying the cjie1-like prophage and one without, were tested in cell culture assays for adherence and invasion. both adherence and invasion of c. jejuni to cells in culture were increased by the presence of the cjie1-family prophage. differences in motility and growth rate did not appear to be responsible. the cjie <dig> prophage was present in 23% of isolates from human and non-human sources combined that were obtained through sentinel-site surveillance, and the distribution of cjie <dig> in this population showed modest clonal associations. there was no correlation between the presence of the cjie <dig> prophage in c. jejuni and patient symptoms, although there was some statistical support for lower rates of abdominal pain and fever when the prophage was present. little evidence was found for a role of the prophage in host adaptation or host specificity.


CONCLUSIONS
these biological effects suggest that the presence of the prophage may be a marker for differential virulence of some c. jejuni isolates. ongoing research into the effects of the prophage on protein expression may provide additional insights into the roles the prophage may play in the biology of its host bacterium.
