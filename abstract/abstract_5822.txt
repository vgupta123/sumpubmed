BACKGROUND
it remains a challenge for recombinant s. cerevisiae to convert xylose in lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysates to ethanol. although industrial diploid strains are more robust compared to laboratory haploid strains, however, industrial diploid s. cerevisiae strains have been less pursued in previous studies. this work aims to construct fast xylose-fermenting yeast using an industrial ethanol-producing diploid s. cerevisiae strain as a host.


RESULTS
fast xylose-fermenting yeast was constructed by genome integration of xylose-utilizing genes and adaptive evolution, including 1) piromyces xyla was introduced to enable the host strain to convert xylose to xylulose; 2) endogenous genes  were overexpressed to accelerate conversion of xylulose to ethanol; 3) candida intermedia gxf <dig>  which encodes a xylose transporter, was introduced at the gre <dig> locus to improve xylose uptake; 4) aerobic evolution in rich xylose media was carried out to increase growth and xylose consumption rates. the best evolved strain cibts <dig> consumed 80 g/l glucose and 40 g/l xylose in rich media within 24 hours at an initial od <dig> of  <dig>   and produced 53 g/l ethanol.


CONCLUSIONS
based on the above fermentation performance, we conclude that cibts <dig> shows great potential for ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass.
