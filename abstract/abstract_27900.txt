BACKGROUND
chemokines are involved in many biological activities ranging from leukocyte differentiation to neuronal morphogenesis. despite numerous reports describing chemokine function, little is known about the molecular changes induced by cytokines.

methods
we have isolated and identified by differential display analysis  <dig> differentially expressed cdnas from cxcr3-transfected jurkat t cells following treatment with cxcl <dig> or cxcl <dig>  these chemokine-modulated genes were further verified using quantitative rt-pcr and western blot analysis.


RESULTS
one hundred and forty-six of the cdnas were successfully cloned, sequenced, and identified by blast. following removal of redundant and non-informative clones, seventeen mrnas were found to be differentially expressed post treatment with either chemokine ligand with several representing known genes with established functions. twenty-one genes were upregulated in these transfected jurkat cells following both cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig>  four genes displayed a discordant response and seven genes were downregulated upon treatment with either chemokine. identified genes include geminin , thioredoxin , dead/h box polypeptide  <dig> , growth hormone inducible transmembrane protein , and transcription elongation regulator  <dig> . subsequent analysis of several of these genes using semi-quantitative pcr and western blot analysis confirmed their differential expression post ligand treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
together, these results provide insight into chemokine-induced gene activation and identify potentially novel functions for known genes in chemokine biology.
