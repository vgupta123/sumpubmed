BACKGROUND
protein tyrosine phosphatases  are important cell signaling regulators with major pathological implications. lyp  is an intracellular enzyme initially found to be predominately expressed in lymphocytes. importantly, an allelic r620w variant of lyp is strongly associated with multiple autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, type  <dig> diabetes, and autoimmune thyroid disease.


RESULTS
in this study, we isolated a novel isoform of lyp designated lyp <dig>  lyp <dig> differs from lyp <dig>  the known isoform of lyp, in that it lacks a  <dig> amino acid segment right after the r620w site embedded in a proline-rich protein-protein interaction motif. genomic sequence analysis revealed that lyp <dig> resulted from alternative splicing of the lyp gene located on chromosome 1p  <dig> - <dig> . reverse transcription pcr analyses of  <dig> human tissues demonstrated that both lyp <dig> and lyp <dig> are predominantly expressed in primary and secondary lymphoid tissues but the relative expression levels of the two isoforms varies in different human tissues and individuals.


CONCLUSIONS
we thus identified a new variant form of lyp and conducted a comprehensive analysis of lyp tissue expressions. considering the pathogenesis of lyp r620w, we believe that the expression of lyp <dig> may have an important role in regulating activity and function of lyp and may be implicated in autoimmune diseases.
