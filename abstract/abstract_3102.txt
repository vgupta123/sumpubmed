BACKGROUND
this study investigated if the h. pylori dupa genotype and certain host single nucleotide polymorphisms  of matrix metalloproteinases  and their inhibitors , including mmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig>  timp- <dig> and timp- <dig>  might correlate with ulcer risk of h. pylori-infected taiwanese patients.


RESULTS
of the  <dig> h. pylori-infected patients enrolled,  <dig> patients  received snps analysis of mmp-3- <dig> 6a > 5a, mmp-7- <dig> a > g, mmp-9exon  <dig> a > g, timp- <dig> t > c and timp-2- <dig> g > c by pcr-rflp. the  <dig> collected h. pylori isolates were detected for the dupa genotype by pcr. the rates of dupa-positive h. pylori infection were similar among patients with duodenal ulcer , gastric ulcer , and gastritis  . males had higher rates of duodenal ulcer and gastric ulcer than females . of h. pylori-infected patients, the mmp- <dig> 6a6a genotype were more common in patients with duodenal ulcers than in those with gastritis  in females. this genotype had a  <dig> -fold  increased risk of duodenal ulcer, compared to those with the 5a carrier. combining the mmp-3/timp- <dig> genotype as 6a6a/cc, the risk of duodenal ulcer increased up to  <dig>  fold  in h. pylori-infected females.


CONCLUSIONS
the mmp- <dig> promoter polymorphism, but not the dupa-status, may correlate with susceptibility to duodenal ulcer after h. pylori infection in taiwanese females.
