BACKGROUND
the d-galacturonic acid derived from plant pectin can be converted into a variety of other chemicals which have potential use as chelators, clarifiers, preservatives and plastic precursors. among these is the deoxy-keto acid derived from l-galactonic acid, keto-deoxy-l-galactonic acid or 3-deoxy-l-threo-hex-2-ulosonic acid. the keto-deoxy sugars have been found to be useful precursors for producing further derivatives. keto-deoxy-l-galactonate is a natural intermediate in the fungal d-galacturonate metabolic pathway, and thus keto-deoxy-l-galactonate can be produced in a simple biological conversion.


RESULTS
keto-deoxy-l-galactonate  accumulated in the culture supernatant when trichoderma reesei Δlga <dig> and aspergillus niger Δgaac were grown in the presence of d-galacturonate. keto-deoxy-l-galactonate accumulated even if no metabolisable carbon source was present in the culture supernatant, but was enhanced when d-xylose was provided as a carbon and energy source. up to  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate l- <dig> was produced from  <dig> g d-galacturonate l- <dig> and a. niger Δgaac produced  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate l- <dig> from  <dig> g polygalacturonate l- <dig>  at yields of  <dig>  to  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate - <dig>  keto-deoxy-l-galactonate accumulated to concentrations of  <dig> to  <dig> g l- <dig> intracellularly in both producing organisms. this intracellular concentration was sustained throughout production in a. niger Δgaac, but decreased in t. reesei.


CONCLUSIONS
bioconversion of d-galacturonate to keto-deoxy-l-galactonate was achieved with both a. niger Δgaac and t. reesei Δlga <dig>  although production  was better with a. niger than t. reesei. a. niger was also able to produce keto-deoxy-l-galactonate directly from pectin or polygalacturonate demonstrating the feasibility of simultaneous hydrolysis and bioconversion. although keto-deoxy-l-galactonate accumulated intracellularly, concentrations above ~ <dig> g l- <dig> were exported to the culture supernatant. lysis may have contributed to the release of keto-deoxy-l-galactonate from t. reesei mycelia.
