BACKGROUND
dagginess  and host nematode parasite resistance are important animal welfare traits in new zealand sheep. genomic prediction  estimates the genetic merit, as a molecular breeding value , for each trait based on many snps. the additional information the mbv provides  has led to its incorporation into breeding schemes. some gp methods give snp effects, which provide additional information to identify genome-wide associations  for a trait of interest. here we report results from a gp and gwas study for dagginess and host nematode parasite resistance in a new zealand sheep industry resource.


RESULTS
genomic prediction analysis was performed using 50k snp chip data and parent average-removed, de-regressed bvs for five traits, from a resource of  <dig> pedigree recorded animals. the five traits were dag score at three and eight months  and nematode faecal egg count in summer , autumn  and as an adult . the resource consisted of romney, coopworth, perendale, texel and various breed crosses . the pure breeds, apart from texel, plus comprcp were used to develop the gp. the resulting snp effects were used to identify genetic regions associated with dagginess and parasite resistance. accuracies of the weighted correlation between mbv and true bv ranged between − <dig>   and  <dig>   for dag <dig> and dag <dig>  for fec <dig>  fec <dig> and afec accuracies ranged between − <dig>   and  <dig>  . the weighted average individual accuracy  ranges were  <dig>   to  <dig>   and  <dig>   to  <dig>   respectively, for dagginess and parasite traits. there was one snp for dag <dig> that reached bonferroni significance threshold  on oar <dig>  the same two snps for each of the parasite traits  and none for dag <dig>  a notable peak was also observed on oar <dig> for all the parasite traits, however, it did not reach the bonferroni significance threshold.


CONCLUSIONS
this study presents the first results of a gwas on dagginess and faecal egg count traits in new zealand sheep. the results suggest that there are quantitative trait loci on oar  <dig> for dagginess and on oar <dig> and seven for faecal egg count.
