BACKGROUND
when natural hybridization occurs at sites where the hybridizing species differ in abundance, the pollen load delivered to the rare species should be predominantly from the common species. previous authors have therefore proposed a hypothesis on the direction of hybridization: interspecific hybrids are more likely to have the female parent from the rare species and the male parent from the common species. we wish to test this hypothesis using data of plant hybridizations both from our own experimentation and from the literature.


RESULTS
by examining the maternally inherited chloroplast dna of  <dig> cases of f <dig> hybridization from four genera of plants, we infer unidirectional hybridization in most cases. in all  <dig> cases where the relative abundance of the parental species deviates from parity, however, the direction is predominantly in the direction opposite of the prediction based strictly on numerical abundance.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the observed direction of hybridization is almost always opposite of the predicted direction based on the relative abundance of the hybridizing species. several alternative hypotheses, including unidirectional postmating isolation and reinforcement of premating isolation, were discussed.
