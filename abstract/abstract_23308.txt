BACKGROUND
trfs,  <dig> to 32 nt long single-stranded rna derived from mature or precursor trnas, are a recently discovered class of small rna that have been found to be present in diverse organisms at read counts comparable to mirnas. currently, there is a debate about their biogenesis and function.


RESULTS
this is the first meta-analysis of trfs. analysis of more than  <dig> short rna libraries has revealed that trfs are precisely generated fragments present in all domains of life , and are not produced by the mirna biogenesis pathway. human par-clip data shows a striking preference for trf-5s and trf-3s to associate with ago <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> rather than ago <dig>  and analysis of positional t to c mutational frequency indicates these trfs associate with argonautes in a manner similar to mirnas. the reverse complements of canonical seed positions in these sequences match cross-link centered regions, suggesting these trf-5s and trf-3s interact with rnas in the cell. consistent with these results, human ago <dig> clash data contains thousands of trf- <dig> and trf- <dig> reads chimeric with mrnas.


CONCLUSIONS
trfs are an abundant class of small rna present in all domains of life whose biogenesis is distinct from mirnas. in human hek <dig> cells trfs associate with argonautes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and not argonaute  <dig> which is the main effector protein of mirna function, but otherwise have very similar properties to mirnas, indicating trfs may play a major role in rna silencing.
