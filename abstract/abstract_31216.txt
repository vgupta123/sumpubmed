BACKGROUND
uterine temporal and dose-dependent histopathologic, morphometric and gene expression responses to the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen  were comprehensively examined to further elucidate its estrogen receptor-mediated effects. these results were systematically compared to the effects elicited by the potent estrogen receptor ligand 17α-ethynylestradiol  to identify pathways similarly and uniquely modified by each compound.


RESULTS
three daily doses of  <dig> μg/kg tam elicited a dose-dependent increase in uterine wet weight  in immature, ovariectomized c57bl/ <dig> mice at  <dig> hrs with concurrent increases in luminal epithelial cell height , luminal circumference and glandular epithelial tubule number. significant uww and lech increases were detected at  <dig> hrs after a single dose of  <dig> μg/kg tam. cdna microarray analysis identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes following a single dose of  <dig> μg/kg tam at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hrs, and at  <dig> hrs after three daily doses . functional annotation of differentially expressed genes was associated with cell growth and proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, extracellular matrix modification, nucleotide synthesis, dna replication, protein synthesis and turnover, lipid metabolism, glycolysis and immunological responses as is expected from the uterotrophic response. comparative analysis of tam and ee treatments identified  <dig> common, differentially expressed genes, the majority of which exhibited similar profiles despite a temporal delay in tam elicited responses. however, several conserved and treatment specific responses were identified that are consistent with proliferation , and water imbibition  responses elicited by ee.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, tam and ee share similar gene expression profiles. however, tam responses exhibit lower efficacy, while responses unique to ee are consistent with the physiological differences elicited between compounds.
