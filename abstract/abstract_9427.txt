BACKGROUND
vaccination strategies that elicit antigen-specific tolerance are needed as therapies for autoimmune disease. this study focused on whether cytokine-neuroantigen  fusion proteins could inhibit disease in chronic murine models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  and thus serve as potential therapeutic modalities for multiple sclerosis.


RESULTS
a fusion protein comprised of murine gm-csf as the n-terminal domain and the encephalitogenic mog35- <dig> peptide as the c-terminal domain was tested as a tolerogenic, therapeutic vaccine  in the c57bl/ <dig> model of eae. administration of gmcsf-mog before active induction of eae, or alternatively, at the onset of eae blocked the development and progression of eae. covalent linkage of the gm-csf and mog35- <dig> domains was required for tolerogenic activity. likewise, a ttv comprised of gm-csf and plp139- <dig> was a tolerogen in the sjl model of eae.


CONCLUSIONS
these data indicated that fusion proteins containing gm-csf coupled to myelin auto-antigens elicit tolerance rather than immunity.
