BACKGROUND
the mitotic exit network  is required for events at the end of mitosis such as degradation of mitotic cyclins and cytokinesis. bub <dig> and its binding partner bfa <dig> act as a gtpase activating protein  to negatively regulate the men gtpase tem <dig>  the bub2/bfa <dig> checkpoint pathway is required to delay the cell cycle in response to mispositioned spindles. in addition to its role in mitotic exit, tem <dig> is required for actomyosin ring contraction.


RESULTS
to test the hypothesis that the bub <dig> pathway prevents premature actin ring assembly, we compared the timing of actin ring formation in wild type, bub2Δ, mad2Δ, and bub2Δmad2Δ cells both with and without microtubules. there was no difference in the timing of actin ring formation between wild type and mutant cells in a synchronized cell cycle. in the presence of nocodazole, both bub2Δ and mad2Δ cells formed rings after a delay of the same duration. double mutant bub2Δmad2Δ and bfa1Δmad2Δ cells formed rings at the same time with and without nocodazole. to determine if bub <dig> has an effect on actomyosin ring contraction through its regulation of tem <dig>  we used live cell imaging of myo1-gfp in a bub2Δ strain. we found a significant decrease in the total time of contraction and an increase in rate of contraction compared to wild type cells. we also examined myosin contraction using myo1-gfp in cells overexpressing an epitope tagged bub <dig>  surprisingly, overexpression of bub <dig> also led to a significant increase in the rate of contraction, as well as morphological defects. the chained cell phenotype caused by bub <dig> overexpression could be rescued by co-overexpression of tem <dig>  and was not rescued by deletion of bfa <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that the bub <dig> checkpoint pathway does not have a specific role in delaying actin ring formation. the observed increase in the rate of myosin contraction in the bub2Δ strain provides evidence that the men regulates actomyosin ring contraction. our data suggest that the overexpression of the bub <dig> fusion protein acts as a dominant negative, leading to septation defects by a mechanism that is tem1-dependent.
