BACKGROUND
many cancer cells develop resistance to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand -induced apoptosis, necessitating combination with chemotherapy, and normal cells manifest side effects due to the combined treatment regimen of trail and chemotherapeutic drugs. a novel cancer therapy utilizing trail is thus urgently needed.


RESULTS
in this study, we exploited trail receptor-mediated endocytosis for the first time to produce a cell-permeable molecule, soluble forms of recombinant trail:iron superoxide dismutase , which possesses strail-induced apoptotic ability and fesod antioxidant activity. the fesod component was rapidly introduced into the cell by strail and intracellular superoxide radical , which have been implicated as potential modulators of apoptosis in cancer cells, was eliminated, resulting in a highly reduced cellular environment. the decrease in cellular o2-, which was accompanied by a brief accumulation of h2o <dig> and downregulation of phosphorylated akt  and cellular flice-inhibitory protein, sensitized k <dig> leukemia cells and human promyelocytic leukemia  cells to trail-induced apoptosis. the low h2o <dig> levels protected human lo <dig> hepatocytes from strail:fesod-induced apoptosis despite downregulation of p-akt. we also obtained evidence that the lack of response to strail:fesod in normal t cells occurred because strail:fesod shows much stronger shifts of redox state in erythroleukemia  and hl- <dig> cells compared to that in normal t cells. k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells underwent strail:fesod-induced apoptosis without the dysfunction of mitochondria.


CONCLUSIONS
the fusion protein overcomes the inability of fesod to permeate the cell membrane, exhibits synergistic apoptotic effects on k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells and demonstrates minimal toxicity to normal t cells and the normal liver cell line lo <dig>  indicating its potential value for the treatment of leukemia.
