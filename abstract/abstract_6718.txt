BACKGROUND
schwann cells  which are myelin-forming cells in peripheral nervous system are very useful for the treatment of diseases of peripheral nervous system and central nervous system. however, it is difficult to obtain sufficient large number of sc for clinical use, so alternative cell systems are desired.


RESULTS
using a procedure similar to the one used for propagation of neural stem cells, we could induce rat adipose-derived stem cells  into floating neurospheres. in addition to being able to differentiate into neuronal- and glial-like cells, neurospheres could be induced to differentiate into sc-like cells. sc-like cells were bi- or tri-polar in shape and immunopositive for nestin and sc markers p <dig>  gfap and s- <dig>  identical to genuine sc. we also found that sc-like cells could induce the differentiation of sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells efficiently, perhaps through secretion of soluble substances. we showed further that sc-like cells could form myelin structures with pc <dig> cell neurites in vitro.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings indicated that adsc could differentiate into sc-like cells in terms of morphology, phenotype and functional capacities. sc-like cells induced from adsc may be useful for the treatment of neurological diseases.
