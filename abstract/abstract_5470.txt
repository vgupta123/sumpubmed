BACKGROUND
insertions/deletions  in protein sequences are useful as drug targets, protein structure predictors, species diagnostics and evolutionary markers. however there is limited understanding of indel evolutionary patterns. we sought to characterize indel patterns focusing first on the major groups of multicellular eukaryotes.


RESULTS
comparisons of complete proteomes from a taxonically broad set of primarily metazoa, fungi and viridiplantae yielded  <dig> substantial  universal, single-copy  proteins, from which  <dig> simple  and  <dig>  complex  indels were extracted. simple indels are mostly small  with a most frequent size class of 1aa. however, even these simple looking indels show a surprisingly high level of hidden homoplasy . among the apparently homoplasy-free simple indels, we identify  <dig> potential clade-defining indels  that may warrant closer examination. cdis show a very uneven taxonomic distribution among viridiplante , fungi , and metazoa . an examination of singleton indels shows an excess of insertions over deletions in nearly all examined taxa. this excess averages  <dig>  overall, with a maximum observed value of  <dig>  fold.


CONCLUSIONS
we find considerable potential for identifying taxon-marker indels using an automated pipeline. however, it appears that simple indels in universal proteins are too rare and homoplasy-rich to be used for pure indel-based phylogeny. the excess of insertions over deletions seen in nearly every genome and major group examined maybe useful in defining more realistic gap penalties for sequence alignment. this bias also suggests that insertions in highly conserved proteins experience less purifying selection than do deletions.
