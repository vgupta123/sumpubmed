BACKGROUND
protein sequence motifs are by definition short fragments of conserved amino acids, often associated with a specific function. accordingly protein sequence profiles derived from multiple sequence alignments provide an alternative description of functional motifs characterizing families of related sequences. such profiles conveniently reflect functional necessities by pointing out proximity at conserved sequence positions as well as depicting distances at variable positions. discovering significant conservation characteristics within the variable positions of profiles mirrors group-specific and, in particular, evolutionary features of the underlying sequences.


RESULTS
we describe the tool profile analysis based on mutual information  that enables comparative analysis of user-classified protein sequences. promi is implemented as a web service using perl and r as well as other publicly available packages and tools on the server-side. on the client-side platform-independence is achieved by generally applied internet delivery standards. as one possible application analysis of the zinc finger c2h2-type protein domain is introduced to illustrate the functionality of the tool.


CONCLUSIONS
the web service promi should assist researchers to detect evolutionary correlations in protein profiles of defined biological sequences. it is available at  where additional documentation can be found.
