BACKGROUND
jatropha curcas l. is an important non-edible oilseed crop with promising future in biodiesel production. however, factors like oil yield, oil composition, toxic compounds in oil cake, pests and diseases limit its commercial potential. well established genetic engineering methods using cloned genes could be used to address these limitations. earlier,  <dig>  unigenes from sanger sequencing of ests, and  <dig>  unique assembled transcripts from  <dig> pyrosequencing of uncloned cdnas were reported. in order to expedite the process of gene discovery, we have undertaken  <dig> pyrosequencing of normalized cdnas prepared from roots, mature leaves, flowers, developing seeds, and embryos of j. curcas.


RESULTS
from  <dig>  raw reads, we obtained  <dig>  quality-filtered and trimmed reads that are suitable for the assembly of transcript sequences. de novo contig assembly of these reads generated  <dig>  assembled transcripts  and  <dig>  singletons. average length of the assembled transcripts was  <dig> bp. about 30% of the transcripts were longer than  <dig> bases, and the size of the longest transcript was  <dig>  bases. blastx analysis revealed that  <dig>  of these transcripts are full-length. the assembled transcripts were validated by rt-pcr analysis of  <dig> transcripts. the results showed that the transcripts were correctly assembled and represent actively expressed genes. kegg pathway mapping showed that  <dig>  transcripts are related to major biochemical pathways including the oil biosynthesis pathway. overall, the current study reports  <dig>  new assembled transcripts which included  <dig> full-length transcripts and  <dig> transcripts that are directly involved in oil biosynthesis.


CONCLUSIONS
the large number of transcripts reported in the current study together with existing ests and transcript sequences will serve as an invaluable genetic resource for crop improvement in jatropha. sequence information of those genes that are involved in oil biosynthesis could be used for metabolic engineering of jatropha to increase oil content, and to modify oil composition.
