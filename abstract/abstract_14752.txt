BACKGROUND
massive industrial production of engineered nanoparticles poses questions about health risks to living beings. in order to understand the underlying mechanisms, we studied the effects of tio <dig> and zno agglomerated engineered nanoparticles  on erythrocytes, platelet-rich plasma and on suspensions of giant unilamelar phospholipid vesicles.


RESULTS
washed erythrocytes, platelet-rich plasma and suspensions of giant unilamelar phospholipid vesicles were incubated with samples of eps. these samples were observed by different microscopic techniques. we found that tio <dig> and zno eps adhered to the membrane of washed human and canine erythrocytes. tio <dig> and zno eps induced coalescence of human erythrocytes. addition of tio <dig> and zno eps to platelet-rich plasma caused activation of human platelets after  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours, respectively, while in canine erythrocytes, activation of platelets due to zno eps occurred already after  <dig> hour. to assess the effect of eps on a representative sample of giant unilamelar phospholipid vesicles, analysis of the recorded populations was improved by applying the principles of statistical physics. tio <dig> eps did not induce any notable effect on giant unilamelar phospholipid vesicles within  <dig> minutes of incubation, while zno eps induced a decrease in the number of giant unilamelar phospholipid vesicles that was statistically significant  already after  <dig> minutes of incubation.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that tio <dig> and zno eps cause erythrocyte aggregation and could be potentially prothrombogenic, while zno could also cause membrane rupture.
