BACKGROUND
high-throughput cdna synthesis and sequencing of poly-enriched rna is rapidly emerging as a technology competing to replace microarrays as a quantitative platform for measuring gene expression.


RESULTS
consequently, we compared full length cdna sequencing to 2-channel gene expression microarrays in the context of measuring differential gene expression. because of its comparable cost to a gene expression microarray, our study focused on the data obtainable from a single lane of an illumina  <dig> g sequencer. we compared sequencing data to a highly replicated microarray experiment profiling two divergent strains of s. cerevisiae.


CONCLUSIONS
using a large number of quantitative pcr  assays, more than previous studies, we found that neither technology is decisively better at measuring differential gene expression. further, we report sequencing results from a diploid hybrid of two strains of s. cerevisiae that indicate full length cdna sequencing can discover heterozygosity and measure quantitative allele-specific expression simultaneously.
