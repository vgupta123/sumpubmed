BACKGROUND
the recently constructed river buffalo whole-genome radiation hybrid panel  has already been used to generate preliminary radiation hybrid  maps for several chromosomes, and buffalo-bovine comparative chromosome maps have been constructed. here, we present the first-generation whole genome rh map  of the river buffalo generated from cattle-derived markers. the rh maps aligned to bovine genome sequence assembly btau_ <dig> , providing valuable comparative mapping information for both species.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> markers were typed on the bburh <dig> panel, of which  <dig> were cattle derived snps. the remaining  <dig> were classified as cattle sequence tagged site , including coding genes, ests, and microsatellites. average retention frequency per chromosome was  <dig> % calculated with  <dig> scorable markers distributed in  <dig> linkage groups covering all autosomes  and the x chromosomes at a lod ≥  <dig>  the estimated total length of the wg-rh map is  <dig>  cr <dig>  fewer than 15% of the markers  could not be placed within any linkage group at a lod score ≥  <dig>  linkage group order for each chromosome was determined by incorporation of markers previously assigned by fish and by alignment with the bovine genome sequence assembly .


CONCLUSIONS
we obtained radiation hybrid chromosome maps for the entire river buffalo genome based on cattle-derived markers. the alignments of our rh maps to the current bovine genome sequence assembly  indicate regions of possible rearrangements between the chromosomes of both species. the river buffalo represents an important agricultural species whose genetic improvement has lagged behind other species due to limited prior genomic characterization. we present the first-generation rh map which provides a more extensive resource for positional candidate cloning of genes associated with complex traits and also for large-scale physical mapping of the river buffalo genome.
