BACKGROUND
zinc finger nucleases  are man-made restriction enzymes useful for manipulating genomes by cleaving target dna sequences. zfns allow therapeutic gene correction or creation of genetically modified model organisms. zfn specificity is not absolute; therefore, it is essential to select zfn target sites without similar genomic off-target sites. it is important to assay for off-target cleavage events at sites similar to the target sequence.


RESULTS
zfn-site is a web interface that searches multiple genomes for zfn off-target sites. queries can be based on the target sequence or can be expanded using degenerate specificity to account for known zfn binding preferences. zfn off-target sites are outputted with links to genome browsers, facilitating off-target cleavage site screening. we verified zfn-site using previously published zfn half-sites and located their target sites and their previously described off-target sites. while we have tailored this tool to zfns, zfn-site can also be used to find potential off-target sites for other nucleases, such as tale nucleases.


CONCLUSIONS
zfn-site facilitates genome searches for possible zfn cleavage sites based on user-defined stringency limits. zfn-site is an improvement over other methods because the fetchgwi search engine uses an indexed search of genome sequences for all zfn target sites and possible off-target sites matching the half-sites and stringency limits. therefore, zfn-site does not miss potential off-target sites.
