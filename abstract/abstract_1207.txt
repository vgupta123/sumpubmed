BACKGROUND
limit dextrinase inhibitor  inhibits starch degradation in barley grains during malting because it binds with limit dextrinase . there is a wide genetic variation in ldi synthesis and inactivation during barley grain development and germination. however, the genetic control of ldi activity remains little understood.


RESULTS
in this study, association analysis was performed on  <dig> tibetan wild accessions by using ldi activity,  <dig> diversity arrays technology  markers and single nucleotide polymorphisms  of the gene hvldi encoding ldi. two dart markers, bpb- <dig>  bpb- <dig>  and  <dig> snps of hvldi were significantly associated with ldi activity, explaining  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of phenotypic variation, respectively. bpb- <dig> is located on chromosome 6h, near the locus of hvldi, and bpb- <dig> is located on 3h.


CONCLUSIONS
the current results confirmed the locus of the gene controlling ldi activity and identified a new dart markers associated with ldi activity. the snps associated with ldi activity may provide a new insight into the genetic variation of ldi activity in barley grains.
