BACKGROUND
we recently identified a novel protein, rearranged l-myc fusion , that is required for dna hypomethylation and transcriptional activity at two specific regions of the genome known to be sensitive to epigenetic gene silencing. to identify other loci affected by the absence of rlf, we have now analysed  <dig> whole genome bisulphite sequencing datasets across three different embryonic tissues/stages from mice wild-type or null for rlf.


RESULTS
here we show that the absence of rlf results in an increase in dna methylation at thousands of elements involved in transcriptional regulation and many of the changes occur at enhancers and cpg island shores. chip-seq for h3k4me <dig>  a mark generally found at regulatory elements, revealed associated changes at many of the regions that are differentially methylated in the rlf mutants. rna-seq showed that the numerous effects of the absence of rlf on the epigenome are associated with relatively subtle effects on the mrna population. in vitro studies suggest that rlf’s zinc fingers have the capacity to bind dna and that the protein interacts with other known epigenetic modifiers.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides the first evidence that the epigenetic modifier rlf is involved in the maintenance of dna methylation at enhancers and cgi shores across the genome.
