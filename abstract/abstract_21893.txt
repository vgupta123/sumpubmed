BACKGROUND
extensive allelic matching in the human leukocyte antigen  genes is regarded as a prerequisite for good clinical success of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation . also other genetic factors can be assumed to play a role in preventing and controlling the complications associated with allogeneic hsct, in particular graft-versus-host disease . interleukin- <dig>  and its receptor , key regulators of the immune response, are among these candidates. we studied the association of il- <dig> and il-10rβ gene polymorphisms with the occurrence of gvhd in  <dig> hla-identical sibling donor and recipient pairs.


RESULTS
the difference in genotypic il- <dig> production between patient and donor in combination with patient il-10rβ a/a genotype predisposed strongly to acute gvhd . on the other hand, a combination of same genotypic il- <dig> production with patient il-10rβ a/a genotype protected from chronic gvhd .


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that il- <dig> and il-10rβ genes have a synergistic effect on the risk of gvhd.
