BACKGROUND
generation of large mate-pair libraries is necessary for de novo genome assembly but the procedure is complex and time-consuming. furthermore, in some complex genomes, it is hard to increase the n <dig> length even with large mate-pair libraries, which leads to low transcript coverage. thus, it is necessary to develop other simple scaffolding approaches, to at least solve the elongation of transcribed fragments.


RESULTS
we describe l_rna_scaffolder, a novel genome scaffolding method that uses long transcriptome reads to order, orient and combine genomic fragments into larger sequences. to demonstrate the accuracy of the method, the zebrafish genome was scaffolded. with expanded human transcriptome data, the n <dig> of human genome was doubled and l_rna_scaffolder out-performed most scaffolding results by existing scaffolders which employ mate-pair libraries. in these two examples, the transcript coverage was almost complete, especially for long transcripts. we applied l_rna_scaffolder to the highly polymorphic pearl oyster draft genome and the gene model length significantly increased.


CONCLUSIONS
the simplicity and high-throughput of rna-seq data makes this approach suitable for genome scaffolding. l_rna_scaffolder is available at http://www.fishbrowser.org/software/l_rna_scaffolder.
