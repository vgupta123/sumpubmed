BACKGROUND
in metazoans, piwi-related argonaute proteins play important roles in maintaining germline integrity and fertility and have been linked to a class of germline-enriched small rnas termed pirnas. caenorhabditis elegans encodes two piwi family proteins called prg- <dig> and prg- <dig>  and prg- <dig> interacts with the c. elegans pirnas . previous studies found that mutation of prg- <dig> causes a marked reduction in the expression of 21u-rnas, temperature-sensitive defects in fertility and other phenotypic defects.


RESULTS
in this study, we wanted to systematically demonstrate the function of prg- <dig> in the regulation of small rnas and their targets. by analyzing small rnas and mrnas with and without a mutation in prg- <dig> during c. elegans development, we demonstrated that  mutation of prg- <dig> leads to a decrease in the expression of 21u-rnas, and causes 35 ~ 40% of mirnas to be down-regulated;  in c. elegans, approximately 3%  of protein-coding genes are differentially expressed after mutating prg- <dig>  and 60 ~ 70% of these substantially altered protein-coding genes are up-regulated;  the target genes of the down-regulated mirnas and the candidate target genes of the down-regulated 21u-rnas are enriched in the up-regulated protein-coding genes; and  prg- <dig> regulates protein-coding genes by down-regulating small rnas  that target genes that participate in the development of c. elegans.


CONCLUSIONS
in prg-1-mutated c. elegans, the expression of mirnas and 21u-rnas was reduced, and the protein-coding targets, which were associated with the development of c. elegans, were up-regulated. this may be the mechanism underlying prg- <dig> function.
