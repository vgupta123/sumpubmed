BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori is presumed to be co-evolved with its human host and is a highly diverse gastric pathogen at genetic levels. ancient origins of h. pylori in the new world are still debatable. it is not clear how different waves of human migrations in south america contributed to the evolution of strain diversity of h. pylori. the objective of our 'phylogeographic' study was to gain fresh insights into these issues through mapping genetic origins of h. pylori of native peruvians  and their genomic comparison with isolates from spain, and japan.


RESULTS
for this purpose, we attempted to dissect genetic identity of strains by fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism  analysis, multilocus sequence typing  of the  <dig> housekeeping genes  and the sequence analyses of the babb adhesin and oipa genes. the whole cag pathogenicity-island  from these strains was analyzed using pcr and the geographic type of caga phosphorylation motif epiya was determined by gene sequencing. we observed that while european genotype  predominates in native peruvian strains, approximately 20% of these strains represent a sub-population with an amerindian ancestry . all of these strains however, irrespective of their ancestral affiliation harbored a complete, 'western' type cagpai and the motifs surrounding it. this indicates a possible acquisition of cagpai by the hsp-amerind strains from the european strains, during decades of co-colonization.


CONCLUSIONS
our observations suggest presence of ancestral h. pylori  in peruvian amerindians which possibly managed to survive and compete against the spanish strains that arrived to the new world about  <dig> years ago. we suggest that this might have happened after native peruvian h. pylori strains acquired cagpai sequences, either by new acquisition in cag-negative strains or by recombination in cag positive amerindian strains.
