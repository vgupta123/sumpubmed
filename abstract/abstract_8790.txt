BACKGROUND
the emergence of imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa  has become a great concern worldwide. the aim of this study was to investigate resistance mechanisms associated with bloodstream isolated irpa strains in taiwan.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> non-duplicated irpa isolates were isolated from patients with bloodstream infection. the average prevalence of imipenem-resistance in those isolates was  <dig>  % during a 10-year longitudinal surveillance in taiwan. pfge results showed high clonal diversity among the  <dig> isolates. vim- <dig>  vim- <dig>  oxa- <dig>  and oxa- <dig> β-lactamases were identified in  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  isolates, respectively. active efflux pumps, ampc β-lactamase overproduction, and extended-spectrum ampc cephalosporinases  were found in  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of irpa isolates, respectively. oprd mutations with amino acid substitution, shortened putative loop l <dig>  premature stop codon caused by point mutation, frameshift by nucleotide insertion or deletion, and interruption by insertion sequence were found in  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  of isolates, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
this study suggests that alterations in the oprd protein and having an active efflux pump are the main mechanisms associated with bloodstream isolated irpa. overproduction of ampc, esacs, and the presence of vim- and oxa-type β-lactamases play additional roles in reduced susceptibility to imipenem in p. aeruginosa isolates in taiwan.
