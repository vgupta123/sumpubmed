BACKGROUND
the yakuts contrast strikingly with other populations from siberia due to their cattle- and horse-breeding economy as well as their turkic language. on the basis of ethnological and linguistic criteria as well as population genetic studies, it has been assumed that they originated from south siberian populations. however, many questions regarding the origins of this intriguing population still need to be clarified . this study attempts to better understand the origins of the yakuts by performing genetic analyses on  <dig> mummified frozen bodies dated from the 15th to the 19th century, excavated from yakutia .


RESULTS
high quality data were obtained for the autosomal strs, y-chromosomal strs and snps and mtdna due to exceptional sample preservation. a comparison with the same markers on seven museum specimens excavated  <dig> to  <dig> years ago showed significant differences in dna quantity and quality. direct access to ancient genetic data from these molecular markers combined with the archaeological evidence, demographical studies and comparisons with  <dig> contemporary individuals from the same location as the frozen bodies helped us to clarify the microevolution of this intriguing population.


CONCLUSIONS
we were able to trace the origins of the male lineages to a small group of horse-riders from the cis-ba√Økal area. furthermore, mtdna data showed that intermarriages between the first settlers with evenks women led to the establishment of genetic characteristics during the 15th century that are still observed today.
