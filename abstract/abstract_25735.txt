BACKGROUND
“brachyspira hampsonii”, discovered in north america in  <dig> associated with dysentery-like illness, is an economically relevant swine pathogen resulting in decreased feed efficiency and increased morbidity, mortality and medication usage. “b. hampsonii” clade ii strain  <dig> has been shown to be causally associated with mucohemorrhagic diarrhea and colitis. our objectives were to determine if “brachyspira hampsonii” clade i strain  <dig> is pathogenic to pigs, and to evaluate the relative diagnostic performance of three ante mortem sampling methodologies . five-week old pigs were intragastrically inoculated thrice with  <dig> genomic equivalents "b. hampsonii" , or served as sham controls . feces were sampled and consistency assessed daily. necropsies were performed 24 h after peak clinical signs.


RESULTS
one pig died due to unrelated illness. nine of  <dig> inoculated pigs, but no controls, developed mucoid or mucohemorrhagic diarrhea . characteristic lesions of swine dysentery were observed in large intestine. “b. hampsonii” strain  <dig> dna was detected by qpcr in feces of all inoculated pigs for up to 6 days prior to the onset of mhd. the organism was isolated from the feces and colons of pigs demonstrating mhd, but not from controls. b. intermedia was isolated from inoculated pigs without mhd, and from  <dig> of  <dig> controls.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that “brachyspira hampsonii” clade i strain  <dig> is pathogenic and causes mucohemorrhagic diarrhea and colitis in susceptible pigs. moreover, the three sampling methodologies performed similarly. genotube livestock, a forensic swab designed to preserve dna during shipping is a useful tool especially in settings where timely transport of diagnostic samples is challenging.
