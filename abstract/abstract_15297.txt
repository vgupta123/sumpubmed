BACKGROUND
small non-coding rnas  are a class of transcripts implicated in several eukaryotic regulatory mechanisms, namely gene silencing and chromatin regulation. despite significant progress in their identification by next generation sequencing  we are still far from understanding their full diversity and functional repertoire.


RESULTS
here we report the identification of trna derived fragments  by ngs of the sncrna fraction of zebrafish. the trfs identified are 18– <dig> nt long, are derived from specific 5′ and 3′ processing of mature trnas and are differentially expressed during development and in differentiated tissues, suggesting that they are likely produced by specific processing rather than random degradation of trnas. we further show that a highly expressed trf  is cleaved in vitro by dicer and has silencing ability, indicating that it can enter the rnai pathway. a computational analysis of zebrafish trfs shows that they are conserved among vertebrates and mining of publicly available datasets reveals that some 5′trfs are differentially expressed in disease conditions, namely during infection and colorectal cancer.


CONCLUSIONS
trfs constitute a class of conserved regulatory rnas in vertebrates and may be involved in mechanisms of genome regulation and in some diseases.
