BACKGROUND
the na+,k+-atpase plays an important role for ion homeostasis in virtually all mammalian cells, including neurons. despite this, there is as yet little known about the isoform specific distribution in neurons.


RESULTS
with help of superresolving stimulated emission depletion microscopy the spatial distribution of na+,k+-atpase in dendritic spines of cultured striatum neurons have been dissected. the found compartmentalized distribution provides a strong evidence for the confinement of neuronal na+,k+-atpase  in the postsynaptic region of the spine.


CONCLUSIONS
a compartmentalized distribution may have implications for the generation of local sodium gradients within the spine and for the structural and functional interaction between the sodium pump and other synaptic proteins. superresolution microscopy has thus opened up a new perspective to elucidate the nature of the physiological function, regulation and signaling role of na+,k+-atpase from its topological distribution in dendritic spines.
