BACKGROUND
the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to amino acid starvation by inducing the transcription factor gcn <dig>  this is mainly mediated via a translational control mechanism dependent upon the translation initiation eif2·gtp·met-trnaimet ternary complex, and the four short upstream open reading frames  in its 5' mrna leader. these uorfs act to attenuate gcn <dig> mrna translation under normal conditions. during amino acid starvation, levels of ternary complex are reduced. this overcomes the gcn <dig> translation attenuation effect via a scanning/reinitiation control mechanism dependent upon uorf spacing.


RESULTS
using published experimental data, we have developed and validated a probabilistic formulation of gcn <dig> translation using the chemical master equation . model  <dig> explains gcn <dig> translation's nonlinear dependency upon uorf placements, and predicts that an as yet unidentified factor, which was proposed to regulate gcn <dig> translation under some conditions, only has pronounced effects upon gcn <dig> translation when intercistronic distances are unnaturally short. a simpler model  <dig> that does not include this unidentified factor could well represent the regulation of a natural gcn <dig> mrna. using parameter values optimised for this algebraic model  <dig>  we performed stochastic simulations by gillespie algorithm to investigate the distribution of ribosomes in different sections of gcn <dig> mrna under distinct conditions. our simulations demonstrated that ribosomal loading in the 5'-untranslated region is mainly determined by the ratio between the rates of 5'-initiation and ribosome scanning, but was not significantly affected by rate of ternary complex binding. importantly, the translation rate for codons starved of cognate trnas is predicted to be the most significant contributor to the changes in ribosomal loading in the coding region under repressing and derepressing conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
our integrated probabilistic models  <dig> and  <dig> explained gcn <dig> translation and helped to elucidate the role of a yet unidentified factor. the ensuing stochastic simulations evaluated different factors that may impact on the translation of gcn <dig> mrna, and integrated translation status with ribosomal density.
