BACKGROUND
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  are widely used in veterinary medicine. robenacoxib is a nsaid with high selectivity for the cyclo-oxygenase- <dig> enzyme. in this study, the efficacy and safety of robenacoxib were evaluated in a prospective, randomised, active- and placebo-controlled masked clinical trial in  <dig> cats undergoing orthopaedic surgery. cats were randomised into two treatment groups: group  <dig>  robenacoxib  administered via subcutaneous  injection before surgery, followed by robenacoxib tablets  administered post-operatively for approximately  <dig> days  and group  <dig>  meloxicam  administered s.c. before surgery, followed by placebo tablets administered post-operatively for approximately  <dig> days . cats were assessed using numerical rating scales  by clinicians before surgery and at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after surgery and at the final visit , and daily by their owners from day  <dig> to the vf.


RESULTS
the primary end point was the global investigator score which was the sum of clinician nrss for posture, behaviour and pain on palpation/manipulation. the efficacy of the single robenacoxib injection, assessed during  <dig> to 22 hours, was statistically non-inferior to meloxicam, with a relative efficacy of  <dig>  . no significant differences were detected during the follow-up treatment with robenacoxib tablets for approximately 9 days compared with placebo via clinician assessments at 28 hours and the vf, or in owner assessments on days 1–vf. there were no significant differences in frequencies of reported adverse events, clinical observations and haematology or clinical chemistry variables between the groups.


CONCLUSIONS
single s.c. injection of robenacoxib before surgery had non-inferior efficacy compared with meloxicam in controlling post-operative pain and inflammation in cats undergoing orthopaedic surgery. follow-up treatment with oral robenacoxib tablets for approximately 9 days was well tolerated, but there were no differences in the efficacy scores after day  <dig> compared with the group receiving meloxicam s.c. followed by placebo control.
