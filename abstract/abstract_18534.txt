BACKGROUND
micrornas  are short, non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression mainly through translational repression of target mrna molecules. more than  <dig> human mirnas have been identified and some are known to be associated with disease phenotypes and to display tissue-specific patterns of expression.

methods
we used high-throughput small rna sequencing to discover novel mirnas in  <dig> human post-mortem prefrontal cortex samples from individuals with huntington’s disease  or parkinson’s disease  and controls without neurological impairment . a custom mirna identification analysis pipeline was built, which utilizes mirdeep* mirna identification and result filtering based on false positive rate estimates.


RESULTS
ninety-nine novel mirna candidates with a false positive rate of less than 5 % were identified. thirty-four of the candidate mirnas show sequence similarity with known mature mirna sequences and may be novel members of known mirna families, while the remaining  <dig> may constitute previously undiscovered families of mirnas. nineteen of the  <dig> candidate mirnas were replicated using independent, publicly-available human brain rna-sequencing samples, and seven were experimentally validated using qpcr.


CONCLUSIONS
we have used small rna sequencing to identify  <dig> putative novel mirnas that are present in human brain samples.
