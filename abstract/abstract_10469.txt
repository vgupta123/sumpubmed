BACKGROUND
the jumonji c  domain containing gene  <dig>  has misleadingly been annotated to encode a transmembrane receptor for the engulfment of apoptotic cells. given the importance of jmjc domain containing proteins in controlling a wide range of diverse biological functions, we undertook a comparative genomic analysis to gain further insights in jmjd <dig> gene organisation, evolution, and protein function.


RESULTS
we describe here a semiautomated computational pipeline to identify and annotate jmjc domain containing proteins. using a sequence segment n-terminal of the jmjd <dig> jmjc domain as query for a reciprocal blast search, we identified homologous sequences in  <dig> species across all major phyla. retrieved jmjd <dig> sequences were used to phylogenetically analyse corresponding loci and their genomic neighbourhood. this analysis let to the identification and characterisation of a bi-directional transcriptional unit compromising the jmjd <dig> and 1110005a03rik genes and to the recognition of a new, before overseen jmjd <dig> exon in mammals. using expression studies, two novel jmjd <dig> splice variants were identified and validated in vivo. analysis of the jmjd <dig> neighbouring gene 1110005a03rik revealed an incident deletion of this gene in two out of three earlier reported jmjd <dig> knockout mice, which might affect previously described conflicting phenotypes. to determine potentially important residues for jmjd <dig> function a structural model of the jmjd <dig> protein was calculated based on sequence conservation. this approach identified a conserved double-stranded Î²-helix  fold and a hxdxnh facial triad as structural motifs. moreover, our systematic annotation in nine species identified  <dig> dsbh fold-containing proteins that split into  <dig> highly conserved subgroups.


CONCLUSIONS
we give further evidence that jmjd <dig> most likely has a function as a nonheme-fe-2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase as previously suggested. further, we provide novel insights into the evolution of jmjd <dig> and other related members of the superfamily of jmjc domain containing proteins. finally, we discuss possibilities of the involvement of jmjd <dig> and 1110005a03rik in an antagonistic biochemical pathway.
