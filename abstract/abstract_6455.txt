BACKGROUND
enteropathogenic escherichia coli  and shigatoxin-producing escherichia coli  share the ability to introduce attaching-and-effacing  lesions on intestinal cells. the genetic determinants for the production of a/e lesions are located on the locus of enterocyte effacement , a pathogenicity island that also contains the genes encoding intimin . this study reports information on the occurrence of eae positive e. coli carried by healthy cattle at the point of slaughter, and on serotypes, intimin variants, and further virulence factors of isolated epec and stec strains.


RESULTS
of  <dig> eae positive bovine e. coli strains, 59% were classified as epec and 41% as stec. epec strains belonged to  <dig> o:h serotypes, six strains to typical epec serogroups. epec strains harbored a variety of intimin variants with eae-β <dig> being most frequently found. moreover, nine epec strains harbored asta , seven bfpa , and only one strain was positive for the eaf plasmid. we have identified a new intimin gene  in three bovine bfpa and asta-positive epec strains of serotype ont:h <dig>  stec strains belonged to seven o:h serotypes with one serotype  accounting for 48% of the strains. the majority of bovine stec strains  belonged to five serotypes previously reported in association with hemolytic uremic syndrom , including one o157:h <dig> stec strain. stec strains harbored four intimin variants with eae-ε <dig> and eae-γ <dig> being most frequently found. moreover, the majority of stec strains carried only stx <dig> genes , and was positive for ehxa  encoding for enterohemolysin. four stec strains showed a virulence pattern characteristic of highly virulent human strains .


CONCLUSIONS
our data confirm that ruminants are an important source of serologically and genetically diverse intimin-harboring e. coli strains. moreover, cattle have not only to be considered as important asymptomatic carriers of o <dig> stec but can also be a reservoir of epec and eae positive non-o <dig> stec, which are described in association with human diseases.
