BACKGROUND
wrky transcription factors are involved in plant responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses. arabidopsis wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  and wrky <dig> transcription factors interact both physically and functionally in plant defense responses. however, their role in plant abiotic stress response has not been directly analyzed.


RESULTS
we report that the three wrkys are involved in plant responses to abscisic acid  and abiotic stress. through analysis of single, double, and triple mutants and overexpression lines for the wrky genes, we have shown that wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> have a positive effect on plant aba sensitivity for inhibition of seed germination and root growth. the same two wrky genes also enhance plant sensitivity to salt and osmotic stress. wrky <dig>  on the other hand, antagonizes wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> in the effect on plant sensitivity to aba and abiotic stress in germination and growth assays. both wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> are rapidly induced by aba, while induction of wrky <dig> by aba is delayed. aba-inducible expression of wrky <dig> is almost completely abolished in the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> mutants. wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> recognize a cluster of w-box sequences in the wrky <dig> promoter and activate wrky <dig> expression in protoplasts. thus, wrky <dig> might be a direct target gene of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> in aba signaling. using a stable transgenic reporter/effector system, we have shown that both wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> act as weak transcriptional activators while wrky <dig> is a transcriptional repressor in plant cells.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that the three related wrky transcription factors form a highly interacting regulatory network that modulates gene expression in both plant defense and stress responses by acting as either transcription activator or repressor.
