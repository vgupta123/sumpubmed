BACKGROUND
mycoplasmas are cell wall-less bacteria which encode a minimal set of proteins. in mycoplasma hominis, the genes encoding the surface-localized membrane complex p60/p <dig> are in an operon with a gene encoding a cytoplasmic, nucleotide-binding protein with a characteristic histidine triad motif . hint is found in both procaryotes and eukaryotes and known to hydrolyze adenosine nucleotides in eukaryotes. immuno-precipitation and biacore analysis revealed an interaction between hint and the p <dig> domain of the membrane complex. as the membrane anchored p <dig> carries an n-terminal uncleaved signal peptide we have proposed that the n-terminus extends into the cytoplasm and interacts with the cytosolic hint.


RESULTS
further characterization of p <dig> suggested that the  <dig>  kda signal peptide is protected from cleavage only in the membrane bound form. we found several proteins were released into the supernatant of a logarithmic phase mycoplasma culture, including p <dig>  which was reduced in size by  <dig> kda. western blot analysis of recombinant p <dig> mutants expressed in e. coli and differing in the n-terminal region revealed that mutation of the + <dig> position of the mature protein  which is important for signal peptidase i recognition resulted in reduced p <dig> secretion. all other p <dig> variants were released into the supernatant, in general as a  <dig> kda protein encompassing the helical part of p <dig>  incubation of m. hominis cells in phosphate buffered saline supplemented with divalent cations revealed that the release of mycoplasma proteins into the supernatant was inhibited by high concentrations of calciumions.


CONCLUSIONS
our model for secretion of the p <dig> protein of m. hominis implies a two-step process. in general the p <dig> protein is transported across the membrane and remains complexed to p <dig>  surface-exposed and membrane anchored via the uncleaved signal sequence. loss of the  <dig>  kda signal peptide seems to be a pre-requisite for p <dig> secretion, which is followed by a proteolytic process leading to a helical  <dig> kda product. we propose that this novel form of two-step secretion is one of the solutions to a life with a reduced gene set.
