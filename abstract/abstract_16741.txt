BACKGROUND
based in epidemiological evidence, repetitive ovulation has been proposed to play a role in the origin of ovarian cancer by inducing an aberrant wound rupture-repair process of the ovarian surface epithelium . accordingly, long term cultures of isolated ose cells undergo in vitro spontaneous transformation thus developing tumorigenic capacity upon extensive subcultivation. in this work, c57bl/ <dig> mouse ose  cells were cultured up to passage  <dig> and their rna and dna copy number profiles obtained at passages  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> by means of dna microarrays. gene ontology, pathway and network analyses were focused in passages earlier than  <dig>  which is a hallmark of malignancy in this model.


RESULTS
at passage  <dig>   <dig> genes were up-regulated in absence of significant dna copy number changes. among these, the top- <dig> enriched functions  comprised  <dig> genes coding for centralspindlin, chromosome passenger and minichromosome maintenance protein complexes. the genes ccnb <dig> , birc <dig> , nusap <dig> and kif <dig> were the most recurrent in over a dozen go terms related to the mitotic process. on the other hand, pten plus the large non-coding rnas malat <dig> and neat <dig> were among the  <dig> down-regulated genes with mrna processing, nuclear bodies, er-stress response and tumor suppression as relevant terms. interestingly, the earliest discrete segmental aneuploidies arose by passage  <dig> in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  by passage  <dig>  when mose cells express the malignant phenotype, the dysregulated gene expression repertoire expanded, dna imbalances enlarged in size and covered additional loci.


CONCLUSIONS
prior to early aneuploidies, overexpression of genes coding for the mitotic apparatus in passage- <dig> pre-malignant mose cells indicate an increased proliferation rate suggestive of replicative stress. concomitant down-regulation of nuclear bodies and rna processing related genes suggests altered control of nuclear rna maturation, features recently linked to impaired dna damage response leading to genome instability. these results, combined with cytogenetic analysis by other authors in this model, suggest that transcriptional profile at passage  <dig> might induce cytokinesis failure by which tetraploid cells approach a near-tetraploid stage containing primary chromosome aberrations that initiate the tumorigenic drive.
