BACKGROUND
we have previously found substantial animal-to-animal and age-dependent variation in the response of holstein fibroblast cultures challenged with lps. to expand on this finding, fibroblast cultures were established from dairy  and beef  cattle and challenged with lps to examine breed-dependent differences in the innate immune response. global gene expression was measured by rna-seq, while an epigenetic basis for expression differences was examined by methylated cpg island recovery assay sequencing  analysis.


RESULTS
the holstein breed displayed a more robust response to lps than the angus breed based on rna-seq analysis of cultures challenged with lps for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h. several immune-associated genes were expressed at greater levels  in holstein cultures including tlr <dig> at all time points and a number of pro-inflammatory genes such as il <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and tnf following lps exposure. despite extensive breed differences in the transcriptome, mira-seq unveiled relatively similar patterns of genome-wide dna methylation between breeds, with an overall hypomethylation of gene promoters. however, by examining the genome in 3kb windows,  <dig> regions of differential methylation were discovered between holstein and angus fibroblasts, and two of these regions fell within the promoter region  of the genes ntrk <dig> and adamts <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
fibroblasts isolated from holstein cattle display a more robust response to lps in comparison to cultures from angus cattle. different selection strategies and management practices exist between these two breeds that likely give rise to genetic and epigenetic factors contributing to the different immune response phenotypes.
