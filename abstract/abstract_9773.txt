BACKGROUND
brassinosteroid hormones regulate many aspects of plant growth and development. the membrane receptor bri <dig> is a central player in the brassinosteroid signaling cascade. semi-dwarf ‘uzu’ barley carries a mutation in a conserved domain of the kinase tail of bri <dig> and this mutant allele is recognised for its positive contribution to both yield and lodging resistance.


RESULTS
here we show that uzu barley exhibits enhanced resistance to a range of pathogens. it was due to a combination of preformed, inducible and constitutive defence responses, as determined by a combination of transcriptomic and biochemical studies. gene expression studies were used to determine that the uzu derivatives are attenuated in downstream brassinosteroid signaling. the reduction of bri <dig> rna levels via virus-induced gene silencing compromised uzu disease resistance.


CONCLUSIONS
the pathogen resistance of uzu derivatives may be due to pleiotropic effects of bri <dig> or the cascade effects of their repressed br signaling.
