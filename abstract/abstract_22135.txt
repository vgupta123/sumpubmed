BACKGROUND
recording of motor evoked potentials  is used during navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation  motor mapping to locate motor function in the human brain. however, factors potentially underlying mep latency variability in neurosurgical motor mapping are vastly unknown. in the context of this study, one hundred brain tumor patients underwent preoperative ntms-based motor mapping of the tumor hemisphere between  <dig> and  <dig>  fourteen predefined predictor variables were recorded, and mep latencies of abductor pollicis brevis muscle , abductor digiti minimi muscle , and flexor carpi radialis muscle  were analyzed using linear mixed-effect multiple regression analysis with the forward step-wise model comparison approach.


RESULTS
common factors  for mep latency variability were gender, most likely due to body height, and antiepileptic drug  intake. muscle-specific factors  for mep latency variability were resting motor threshold , tumor side, and tumor location.


CONCLUSIONS
based on a large cohort of neurosurgical patients, this study provides data on a wide range of clinical factors that may underlie mep latency variability. the factors that significantly contributed to mep latency variability should be standardly recorded and taken into consideration during neurosurgical motor mapping.
