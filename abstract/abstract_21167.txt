BACKGROUND
type  <dig> diabetes  is the most common form of diabetes in humans and is closely associated with dyslipidemia and obesity that magnifies the mortality and morbidity related to t2d. the genetic contribution to human t2d and related metabolic disorders is evident, and mostly follows polygenic inheritance. the tallyho/jngj  mice are a polygenic model for t2d characterized by obesity, hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose uptake and tolerance, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia.


RESULTS
in order to determine the genetic factors that contribute to these t2d related characteristics in th mice, we interbred th mice with c57bl/6j  mice. the parental, f <dig>  and f <dig> mice were phenotyped at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> weeks of age for 4-hour fasting plasma triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin, and glucose levels and body, fat pad and carcass weights. the f <dig> mice were genotyped genome-wide and used for quantitative trait locus  mapping. we also applied a genetical genomic approach using a subset of the f <dig> mice to seek candidate genes underlying the qtls. major qtls were detected on chromosomes   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for hypertriglyceridemia,  <dig> and  <dig> for hypercholesterolemia,  <dig> for hyperglycemia,  <dig> and  <dig> for body weight,  <dig> for fat pad weight, and  <dig> and  <dig> for carcass weight. most alleles, except for chr  <dig> and  <dig> qtls, increased phenotypic values when contributed by the th strain. fourteen pairs of interacting loci were detected, none of which overlapped the major qtls. the qtl interval linked to hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia on distal chr  <dig> contains apoa <dig> gene. sequencing analysis revealed polymorphisms of apoa <dig> in th mice, suggesting apoa <dig> as the candidate gene for the hyperlipidemia qtl. gene expression analysis added novel information and aided in selection of candidates underlying the qtls.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified several genetic loci that affect the quantitative variations of plasma lipid and glucose levels and obesity traits in a th Ã— b <dig> intercross. polymorphisms in apoa <dig> gene are suggested to be responsible for the chr  <dig> qtl linked to hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. further, genetical genomic analysis led to potential candidate genes for the qtls.
