BACKGROUND
several clinical studies suggested that antipsychotic-based medications could ameliorate cognitive functions impaired in certain schizophrenic patients. accordingly, we investigated the effects of various dopaminergic receptor antagonists – including atypical antipsychotics that are prescribed for the treatment of schizophrenia – in a model of toxicity using cultured hippocampal neurons, the hippocampus being a region of particular relevance to cognition.


RESULTS
hippocampal cell death induced by deprivation of growth medium constituents was strongly blocked by drugs including antipsychotics  that display nm affinities for d <dig> and/or d <dig> receptors -sulpiride, domperidone, clozapine, risperidone, chlorpromazine, -butaclamol and l- <dig> ). these effects were shared by some caspases inhibitors and were not accompanied by inhibition of reactive oxygen species. in contrast, -raclopride and remoxipride, two drugs that preferentially bind d <dig> over d <dig> receptors were ineffective, as well as the selective d <dig> receptor antagonist u  <dig>  interestingly, -raclopride  was able to block the neuroprotective effect of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine .


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these data suggest that d2-like receptors, particularly the d <dig> subtype, mediate the neuroprotective effects of antipsychotic drugs possibly through a ros-independent, caspase-dependent mechanism.
