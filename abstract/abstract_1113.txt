BACKGROUND
g-protein coupled receptors  play an inordinately large role in human health. variation in the genes that encode these receptors is associated with numerous disorders across the entire spectrum of disease. gpcrs also represent the single largest class of drug targets and associated pharmacogenetic effects are modulated, in part, by polymorphisms. recently, non-human primate models have been developed focusing on naturally-occurring, functionally-parallel polymorphisms in candidate genes. this work aims to extend those studies broadly across the roughly  <dig> non-olfactory gpcrs. initial efforts include resequencing  <dig> indian-origin rhesus macaques ,  <dig> chinese-origin rhesus macaques, and  <dig> cynomolgus macaques .


RESULTS
using the agilent target enrichment system, capture baits were designed for gpcrs off the human and rhesus exonic sequence. using next generation sequencing technologies, nearly  <dig>  snps were identified in coding sequences including over  <dig>  non-synonymous and more than  <dig>  synonymous protein-coding snps. as expected, regions showing the least evolutionary constraint show greater rates of polymorphism and greater numbers of higher frequency polymorphisms. while the vast majority of these snps are singletons, roughly  <dig>  non-synonymous and  <dig>  synonymous snps were found in multiple individuals.


CONCLUSIONS
in all three populations, polymorphism and divergence is highly concentrated in n-terminal and c-terminal domains and the third intracellular loop region of gpcrs, regions critical to ligand-binding and signaling. snp frequencies in macaques follow a similar pattern of divergence from humans and new polymorphisms in primates have been identified that may parallel those seen in humans, helping to establish better non-human primate models of disease.
