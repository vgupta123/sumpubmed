BACKGROUND
guinea fowl  production as an alternative source of meat and poultry has shown potential for economic viability. however, there has been little progress in characterizing the transcriptome of the guinea fowl. in this study rna-sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly of several guinea fowl tissues  which play key roles in regulating feed intake, satiety, and immune function was performed using illumina’s hi-seq  <dig> 


RESULTS
 <dig> million sequences were generated and assembled into  <dig>  contigs using the trinity software suite. over  <dig>  of these transcripts were found to have in silico translated protein sequences that are homologous to chicken protein sequences. gene ontology analysis uncovered  <dig> transcripts with metabolic functions and  <dig> with immune function.


CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptome information presented here will support the development of molecular approaches to improve production efficiency of the guinea fowl and other avian species.
