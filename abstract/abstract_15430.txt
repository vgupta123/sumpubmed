BACKGROUND
through the use of dna microarrays it is now possible to obtain quantitative measurements of the expression of thousands of genes from a biological sample. this technology yields a global view of gene expression that can be used in several ways. functional insight into expression profiles is routinely obtained by using gene ontology terms associated to the cellular genes. in this paper, we deal with functional data mining from expression profiles, proposing a novel approach that studies the correlations between genes and their relations to gene ontology . by using this "functional correlations comparison" we explore all possible pairs of genes identifying the affected biological processes by analyzing in a pair-wise manner gene expression patterns and linking correlated pairs with gene ontology terms.


RESULTS
we apply here this "functional correlations comparison" approach to identify the existing correlations in hepatocarcinoma  and to reveal functional differences between normal liver and cancer tissues. the number of well-correlated pairs in each go term highlights several differences in genetic interactions between cancer and normal tissues. we performed a bootstrap analysis in order to compute false detection rates  and confidence limits.


CONCLUSIONS
experimental results show the main advantage of the applied method: it both picks up general and specific go terms . the results obtained by this novel method are highly coherent with the ones proposed by other cancer biology studies. but additionally they highlight the most specific and interesting go terms helping the biologist to focus his/her studies on the most relevant biological processes.
