BACKGROUND
the newt notophthalmus viridescens possesses the remarkable ability to respond to cardiac damage by formation of new myocardial tissue. surprisingly little is known about changes in gene activities that occur during the course of regeneration. to begin to decipher the molecular processes, that underlie restoration of functional cardiac tissue, we generated an est database from regenerating newt hearts and compared the transcriptional profile of selected candidates with genes deregulated during zebrafish heart regeneration.


RESULTS
a cdna library of  <dig>  cdna clones was generated from newt hearts  <dig> days after ventricular injury. sequencing of  <dig> cdna clones resulted in  <dig> assembled contigs. blast searches revealed  <dig> sequences with potential homology to sequences from the ncbi database. blast searches to trembl and swiss-prot databases assigned  <dig> proteins to gene ontology terms. we also identified a relatively large set of  <dig> orfs, which are likely to be unique for urodele amphibians. expression analysis of newt-zebrafish homologues confirmed the deregulation of selected genes during heart regeneration. sequences, blast results and go annotations were visualized in a relational web based database followed by grouping of identified proteins into clusters of go terms. comparison of data from regenerating zebrafish hearts identified biological processes, which were uniformly overrepresented during cardiac regeneration in newt and zebrafish.


CONCLUSIONS
we concluded that heart regeneration in newts and zebrafish led to the activation of similar sets of genes, which suggests that heart regeneration in both species might follow similar principles. the design of the newly established newt est database allows identification of molecular pathways important for heart regeneration.
