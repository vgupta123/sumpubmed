BACKGROUND
a cholesterol-palmitoyl interaction has been reported to occur in the dimeric interface of the β2-adrenergic receptor crystal structure. we sought to investigate whether a similar phenomenon could be observed with μ-opioid receptor , and if so, to assess the role of cholesterol in this class of g protein-coupled receptor  signaling.


RESULTS
c <dig>  was determined to be the palmitoylation site of oprm <dig>  mutation of this cys to ala did not affect the binding of agonists, but attenuated receptor signaling and decreased cholesterol associated with the receptor signaling complex. in addition, both attenuation of receptor palmitoylation  and inhibition of cholesterol synthesis  impaired receptor signaling, possibly by decreasing receptor homodimerization and gαi <dig> coupling; this was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence colocalization and fluorescence resonance energy transfer  analyses. a computational model of the oprm <dig> homodimer structure indicated that a specific cholesterol-palmitoyl interaction can facilitate oprm <dig> homodimerization at the tmh4-tmh <dig> interface.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that c <dig>  is the palmitoylation site of oprm <dig> and identify a cholesterol-palmitoyl interaction in the oprm <dig> complex. our findings suggest that this interaction contributes to oprm <dig> signaling by facilitating receptor homodimerization and g protein coupling. this conclusion is supported by computational modeling of the oprm <dig> homodimer.
