BACKGROUND
phloem feeding insects, such as aphids, feed almost continuously on plant phloem sap, a liquid diet that contains high concentrations of sucrose . to access the available carbon, aphids hydrolyze sucrose in the gut lumen and transport its constituent monosaccharides, glucose and fructose. although sugar transport plays a critical role in aphid nutrition, the molecular basis of sugar transport in aphids, and more generally across all insects, remains poorly characterized. here, using the latest release of the pea aphid, acyrthosiphon pisum, genome we provide an updated gene annotation and expression profile of putative sugar transporters. finally, gut expressed sugar transporters are functionally expressed in yeast and screened for glucose and fructose transport activity.


RESULTS
in this study, using a de novo approach, we identified  <dig> sugar porter  family transporters in the a. pisum genome. gene expression analysis, based on  <dig>   <dig> a. pisum expressed sequence tags, supports  <dig> sugar porter family transporters being actively expressed in adult female aphids. further analysis, using quantitative pcr identifies  <dig> transporters, a. pisum sugar transporter  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  as highly expressed and/or enriched in gut tissue. when expressed in a saccharomyces cerevisiae hexose transporter deletion mutant , only apst <dig>  and apst <dig>  transport glucose and fructose resulting in functional rescue of the yeast mutant. here we characterize apst <dig>  a  <dig> amino acid protein, with  <dig> predicted transmembrane regions, as a facilitative glucose/fructose transporter. finally, phylogenetic reconstruction reveals that apst <dig>  and related, as yet uncharacterized insect transporters are phylogenetically closely related to human glut  class i facilitative glucose/fructose transporters.


CONCLUSIONS
the gut enhanced expression of apst <dig>  and the transport specificity of its product is consistent with apst <dig> functioning as a gut glucose/fructose transporter. here, we hypothesize that both apst <dig>  and apst <dig>  function at the gut interface to import glucose and fructose from the gut lumen.
