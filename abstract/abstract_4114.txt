BACKGROUND
the dna repair and recombination  proteins protect organisms against genetic damage, caused by environmental agents and other genotoxic agents, by removal of dna lesions or helping to abide them.


RESULTS
we identified genes potentially involved in drr mechanisms in arabidopsis and rice using similarity searches and conserved domain analysis against proteins known to be involved in drr in human, yeast and e. coli. as expected, many of drr genes are very similar to those found in other eukaryotes. beside these eukaryotes specific genes, several prokaryotes specific genes were also found to be well conserved in plants. in arabidopsis, several functionally important drr gene duplications are present, which do not occur in rice. among drr proteins, we found that proteins belonging to the nucleotide excision repair pathway were relatively more conserved than proteins needed for the other drr pathways. sub-cellular localization studies of drr gene suggests that these proteins are mostly reside in nucleus while gene drain in between nucleus and cell organelles were also found in some cases.


CONCLUSIONS
the similarities and dissimilarities in between plants and other organisms' drr pathways are discussed. the observed differences broaden our knowledge about drr in the plants world, and raises the potential question of whether differentiated functions have evolved in some cases. these results, altogether, provide a useful framework for further experimental studies in these organisms.
