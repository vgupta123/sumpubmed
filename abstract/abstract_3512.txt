BACKGROUND
the prediction of a consensus structure for a set of related rnas is an important
                  first step for subsequent analyses. rnaalifold, which computes the minimum energy
                  structure that is simultaneously formed by a set of aligned sequences, is one of
                  the oldest and most widely used tools for this task. in recent years, several
                  alternative approaches have been advocated, pointing to several shortcomings of
                  the original rnaalifold approach.


RESULTS
we show that the accuracy of rnaalifold predictions can be improved substantially
                  by introducing a different, more rational handling of alignment gaps, and by
                  replacing the rather simplistic model of covariance scoring with more
                  sophisticated ribosum-like scoring matrices. these improvements are achieved
                  without compromising the computational efficiency of the algorithm. we show here
                  that the new version of rnaalifold not only outperforms the old one, but also
                  several other tools recently developed, on different datasets.


CONCLUSIONS
the new version of rnaalifold not only can replace the old one for almost any
                  application but it is also competitive with other approaches including those based
                  on scfgs, maximum expected accuracy, or hierarchical nearest neighbor
               classifiers.
