BACKGROUND
the exon junction complex , which contains four core components, eukaryotic initiation factor 4aiii , mago/nashi , y14/tsunagi/rna-binding protein 8a, and barentsz/metastatic lymph node  <dig>  is formed in both nucleus and cytoplasm, and plays important roles in gene expression. genes encoding core ejc components have been found in plants, including rice. currently, the functional characterizations of mago and y <dig> homologs have been demonstrated in rice. however, it is still unknown whether eif4aiii is essential for the functional ejc in rice.


RESULTS
this study investigated two dead box rna helicases, osrh <dig> and osrh <dig>  which are homologous to eif4aiii, in rice. amino acid sequence analysis indicated that osrh <dig> and osrh <dig> had 99 % identity and 100 % similarity, and their gene expression patterns were similar in various rice tissues, but the level of osrh <dig> mrna was about 58-fold higher than that of osrh <dig> mrna in seedlings. from bimolecular fluorescence complementation results, osrh <dig> and osrh <dig> interacted physically with osmago <dig> and osy14b, respectively, which indicated that both of osrh <dig> and osrh <dig> were core components of the ejc in rice. to study the biological roles of osrh <dig> and osrh <dig> in rice, transgenic rice plants were generated by rna interference. the phenotypes of three independent osrh <dig> and osrh <dig> double-knockdown transgenic lines included dwarfism, a short internode distance, reproductive delay, defective embryonic development, and a low seed setting rate. these phenotypes resembled those of mutants with gibberellin-related developmental defects. in addition, the osrh <dig> and osrh <dig> double-knockdown transgenic lines exhibited the accumulation of unspliced rice undeveloped tapetum  <dig> mrna.


CONCLUSIONS
rice contains two eif4aiii paralogous genes, osrh <dig> and osrh <dig>  the abundance of osrh <dig> mrna was about 58-fold higher than that of osrh <dig> mrna in seedlings, suggesting that the osrh <dig> is major eif4aiii in rice. both osrh <dig> and osrh <dig> are core components of the ejc, and participate in regulating of plant height, pollen, and seed development in rice.
