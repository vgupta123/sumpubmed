BACKGROUND
annexin a <dig> is a member of the annexin protein family, which is characterized by its ability to interact with phospholipids in the presence of ca2+-ions and which is thought to function in ca2+-homeostasis. results from mutant mice showed altered ca2+-wave propagation in astrocytes. as the appearance and distribution of annexin a <dig> during brain development has not been investigated so far, we focused on the distribution of annexin a <dig> protein during mouse embryogenesis in the developing central nervous system and in the adult mouse brain.


RESULTS
annexin a <dig> is expressed in cells of the developing brain where a change in its subcellular localization from cytoplasm to nucleus was observed. in the adult cns, the subcellular distribution of annexin a <dig> depends on the cell type. by immunohistochemistry analysis annexin a <dig> was detected in the cytosol of undifferentiated cells at embryonic days e5–e <dig>  at e11–e <dig> the protein is still present in the cytosol of cells predominantly located in the ventricular germinative zone surrounding the lateral ventricle. later on, at embryonic day e <dig>  annexin a <dig> in cells of the intermediate and marginal zone of the neopallium translocates to the nucleus. neuronal cells of all areas in the adult brain present annexin a <dig> in the nucleus, whereas glial fibrillary acidic protein -positive astrocytes exhibit both, a cytoplasmic and nuclear staining. the presence of nuclear annexin a <dig> was confirmed by extraction of the nucleoplasm from isolated nuclei obtained from neuronal and astroglial cell lines.


CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated a translocation of annexin a <dig> to nuclei of cells in early murine brain development and the presence of annexin a <dig> in nuclei of neuronal cells in the adult animal. the role of annexin a <dig> in nuclei of differentiating and mature neuronal cells remains elusive.
