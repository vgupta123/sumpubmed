BACKGROUND
segmental duplications  are euchromatic portions of genomic dna  that occur at more than one site within the genome, and typically share a high level of sequence identity . approximately 5% of the human genome is composed of such duplicated sequences. here we report the detailed investigation of chek <dig> duplications. chek <dig> is a multiorgan cancer susceptibility gene encoding a cell cycle checkpoint kinase acting in the dna-damage response signalling pathway. the continuous presence of the chek <dig> gene in all eukaryotes and its important role in maintaining genome stability prompted us to investigate the duplicative evolution and phylogeny of chek <dig> and its paralogs during anthropoid evolution.


RESULTS
to study chek <dig> duplicon evolution in anthropoids we applied a combination of comparative fish and in silico analyses. our comparative fish results with a chek <dig> fosmid probe revealed the single-copy status of chek <dig> in new world monkeys, old world monkeys and gibbons. whereas a single chek <dig> duplication was detected in orangutan, a multi-site signal pattern indicated a burst of duplication in african great apes and human. phylogenetic analysis of paralogous and ancestral chek <dig> sequences in human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque confirmed this burst of duplication, which occurred after the radiation of orangutan and african great apes. in addition, we used inter-species quantitative pcr to determine chek <dig> copy numbers. an amplification of chek <dig> was detected in african great apes and the highest chek <dig> copy number of all analysed species was observed in the human genome. furthermore, we detected variation in chek <dig> copy numbers within the analysed set of human samples.


CONCLUSIONS
our detailed analysis revealed the highly dynamic nature of chek <dig> duplication during anthropoid evolution. we determined a burst of chek <dig> duplication after the radiation of orangutan and african great apes and identified the highest chek <dig> copy number in human. in conclusion, our analysis of chek <dig> duplicon evolution revealed that sds contribute to inter-species variation. furthermore, our qpcr analysis led us to presume chek <dig> copy number variation in human, and molecular diagnostics of the cancer susceptibility gene chek <dig> inside the duplicated region might be hampered by the individual-specific set of duplicons.
