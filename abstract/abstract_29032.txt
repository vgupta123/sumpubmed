BACKGROUND
celiac disease  is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine in which dietary gluten ingestion leads to a chronic enteropathy. recently, scientific evidence suggested a potential role of gut microbiota in cd. to have a snapshot of dominant duodenal microbiota we analyzed the mucosa-associated microbiota of  <dig> children with cd, before and after a gluten-free diet  regimen, and of  <dig> controls. total dna was extracted from duodenal biopsies and amplification products of 16s ribosomal dna were compared by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis . ttge profiles were analyzed by statistical multivariate analysis.


RESULTS
the average number of bands in ttge profiles was significantly higher  in active  and inactive states  than in controls . mean interindividual similarity index was  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for active disease,  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for remission state and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for controls. similarity index between celiac children before and after gfd treatment was  <dig> % ±  <dig> %. differences in microbiota biodiversity were among active and remission state  and amid active cd and controls . bacteroides vulgatus and escherichia coli were detected more often in cd patients than in controls .


CONCLUSIONS
overall, the results highlighted a peculiar microbial ttge profile and a significant higher biodiversity in cd pediatric patients' duodenal mucosa. the possible pathophysiological role of these microbial differences needs further characterization.
