BACKGROUND
dengue virus  infection is the most important arthropod- borne viral disease in human, but antiviral therapy and approved vaccines remain unavailable due to antibody-dependent enhancement  phenomenon. many studies showed that pre-membrane -specific antibodies do not efficiently neutralize denv infection but potently promote ade infection. however, most of the binding epitopes of these antibodies remain unknown.


RESULTS
in the present study, we characterized a denv cross-reactive monoclonal antibody , 4d <dig>  that neutralized poorly but potently enhanced infection of four standard denv serotypes and immature denv  over a broad range of concentration. in addition, the epitope of 4d <dig> was successfully mapped to amino acid residues  <dig> to <dig> of denv1- <dig> prm protein using a phage-displayed peptide library and comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. we found that the epitope was denv serocomplex cross-reactive and showed to be highly immunogenic in balb/c mice. furthermore, antibody against epitope peptide pl <dig>  like 4d <dig>  showed broad cross-reactivity and weak neutralizing activtity with four standard denv serotypes and imdenv but significantly promoted ade infection. these results suggested 4d <dig> and anti-pl <dig> sera were infection-enhancing antibodies and pl <dig> was infection-enhancing epitope.


CONCLUSIONS
we mapped the epitope of 4d <dig> to amino acid residues  <dig> to <dig> of denv1- <dig> prm and found that this epitope was infection-enhancing. these findings may provide significant implications for future vaccine design and facilitate understanding the pathogenesis of denv infection.
