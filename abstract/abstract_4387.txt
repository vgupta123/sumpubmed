BACKGROUND
given the complexity of higher organisms, the number of genes encoded by their genomes is surprisingly small. tissue specific regulation of expression and splicing are major factors enhancing the number of the encoded products. commonly these mechanisms are intragenic and affect only one gene.


RESULTS
here we provide evidence that the il4i <dig> gene is specifically transcribed from the apparent promoter of the upstream nup <dig> gene, and that the first two exons of nup <dig> are also contained in the novel il4i1_ <dig> variant. while expression of il4i <dig> driven from its previously described promoter is found mostly in b cells, the expression driven by the nup <dig> promoter is restricted to cells in testis  and in the brain . since nup <dig> is itself ubiquitously expressed, the il4i1_ <dig> variant likely derives from cell type specific alternative pre-mrna processing.


CONCLUSIONS
comparative genomics suggest that the promoter upstream of the nup <dig> gene originally belonged to the il4i <dig> gene and was later acquired by nup <dig> via insertion of a retroposon. since both genes are apparently essential, the promoter had to serve two genes afterwards. expression of the il4i <dig> gene from the "nup62" promoter and the tissue specific involvement of the pre-mrna processing machinery to regulate expression of two unrelated proteins indicate a novel mechanism of gene regulation.
