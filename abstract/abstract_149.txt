BACKGROUND
drug resistance is an emerging problem among streptococcal and enterococcal species. automated diagnostic systems for species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing  have become recently available. we evaluated drug susceptibility of clinical isolates of streptococci and enterococci using the recent phoenix system . diagnostic tools included the new smic/id- <dig> panel for streptococci, and the pmic/id- <dig> for enterococci. two-hundred and fifty isolates have been investigated: β-hemolytic streptococci , streptococcus pneumoniae , viridans group streptococci , enterococcus faecium , enterococcus faecalis , other catalase-negative cocci . when needed, species id was determined using molecular methods. test bacterial strains were chosen among those carrying clinically-relevant resistance determinants . ast results of the phoenix system were compared to minimal inhibitory concentration  values measured by the etest method .


RESULTS
streptococci: essential agreement  and categorical agreement  were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. major  and minor errors  accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of isolates, respectively. no very major errors  were produced. enterococci: ea was 97%, ca 96%. small numbers of vme , me  and me  were obtained. overall, ea and ca rates for most drugs were above 90% for both genera. a few vme were found: a) teicoplanin and high-level streptomycin for e. faecalis, b) high-level gentamicin for e. faecium. the mean time to results  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h, with minor differences between streptococci and enterococci.


CONCLUSIONS
the phoenix system emerged as an effective tool for quantitative ast. panels based on dilution tests provided rapid and accurate mic values with regard to clinically-relevant streptococcal and enterococcal species.
