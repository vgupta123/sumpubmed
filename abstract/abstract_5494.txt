BACKGROUND
selenium  and sulfur  are closely related elements that exhibit similar chemical properties. some genes related to s metabolism are also involved in se utilization in many organisms. however, the evolutionary relationship between the two utilization traits is unclear.


RESULTS
in this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of the selenophosphate synthetase  family, a key protein for all known se utilization traits, in all sequenced archaea. our search showed a very limited distribution of seld and se utilization in this kingdom. interestingly, a seld-like protein was detected in two orders of crenarchaeota: sulfolobales and thermoproteales. sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed that seld-like protein contains the same domain and conserved functional residues as those of seld, and might be involved in s metabolism in these s-reducing organisms. further genome-wide analysis of patterns of gene occurrence in different thermoproteales suggested that several genes, including sira-like, prx-like and adenylylsulfate reductase, were strongly related to seld-like gene. based on these findings, we proposed a simple model wherein seld-like may play an important role in the biosynthesis of certain thiophosphate compound.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest novel genes involved in s metabolism in hyperthermophilic s-reducing archaea, and may provide a new window for understanding the complex relationship between se and s metabolism in archaea.
