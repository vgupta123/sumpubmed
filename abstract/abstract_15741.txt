BACKGROUND
the bacterial community of the small intestine is a key factor that has strong influence on the health of gastrointestinal tract  in mammals during and shortly after weaning. the aim of this study was to analyze the effects of the diets of supplemented with epidermal growth factor -expressed saccharomyces cerevisiae  on the duodenal microbiotas of weaned piglets.


RESULTS
revealed in this study, at day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, the compositional sequencing analysis of the 16s rrna in the duodenum had no marked difference in microbial diversity from the phylum to species levels between the invsc <dig> and other recombinant strains encompassing invsc1-ee, invsc1-te, and invsc1-ie. furthermore, the populations of potentially enterobacteria  and probiotic  also remained unchanged among recombinant s. cerevisiae groups . however, the compositional sequencing analysis of the 16s rrna in the duodenum revealed significant difference in microbial diversity from phylum to species levels between the control group and recombinant s. cerevisiae groups. in terms of the control group , these data confirmed that dietary exogenous s. cerevisiae had the feasibility to be used as a supplement for enhancing potentially probiotic  , and reducing potentially pathogenic bacteria  .


CONCLUSIONS
herein, altered the microbiome effect was really s. cerevisiae, and then different forms of recombinant egf, including t-egf, ee-egf and ie-egf, did not appear to make a significant difference to the microbiome of weaned piglets.
