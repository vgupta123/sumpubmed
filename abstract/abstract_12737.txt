BACKGROUND
geranyl pyrophosphate  and p-hydroxybenzoate  are the basic precursors involved in shikonins biosynthesis. gpp is derived from mevalonate  and/or 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate  pathway, depending upon the metabolite and the plant system under consideration. phb, however, is synthesized by only phenylpropanoid  pathway. gpp and phb are central moieties to yield shikonins through the synthesis of m-geranyl-p-hydroxybenzoate . enzyme p-hydroxybenzoate-m-geranyltransferase  catalyses the coupling of gpp and phb to yield ghb.

the present research was carried out in shikonins yielding plant arnebia , wherein no molecular work has been reported so far. the objective of the work was to identify the preferred gpp synthesizing pathway for shikonins biosynthesis, and to determine the regulatory genes involved in the biosynthesis of gpp, phb and ghb.


RESULTS
a cell suspension culture-based, low and high shikonins production systems were developed to facilitate pathway identification and finding the regulatory gene. studies with mevinolin and fosmidomycin, inhibitors of mva and mep pathway, respectively suggested mva as a preferred route of gpp supply for shikonins biosynthesis in arnebia. accordingly, genes of mva pathway , pp pathway , and ghb biosynthesis were cloned. expression studies showed down-regulation of all the genes in response to mevinolin treatment, whereas gene expression was not influenced by fosmidomycin. expression of all the twelve genes vis-Ã -vis shikonins content in low and high shikonins production system, over a period of twelve days at frequent intervals, identified critical genes of shikonins biosynthesis in arnebia.


CONCLUSIONS
a positive correlation between shikonins content and expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase  and aepgt suggested critical role played by these genes in shikonins biosynthesis. higher expression of genes of pp pathway was a general feature for higher shikonins biosynthesis.
