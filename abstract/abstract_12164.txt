BACKGROUND
the large serine recombinase phic <dig> from broad host range streptomyces temperate phage, catalyzes the site-specific recombination of two recognition sites that differ in sequence, typically known as attachment sites attb and attp. previously, we characterized the phic <dig> catalytic activity and modes of action in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe.


RESULTS
in this work, the phic <dig> recombinase gene was placed under the control of the arabidopsis oxs <dig> promoter and introduced into arabidopsis harboring a chromosomally integrated attb and attp-flanked target sequence. the phic <dig> recombinase excised the attb and attp-flanked dna, and the excision event was detected in subsequent generations in the absence of the phic <dig> gene, indicating germinal transmission was possible. we further verified that the genomic excision was conservative and that introduction of a functional recombinase can be achieved through secondary transformation as well as manual crossing.


CONCLUSIONS
the phic <dig> system performs site-specific recombination in germinal tissue, a prerequisite for generating stable lines with unwanted dna removed. the precise site-specific deletion by phic <dig> in planta demonstrates that the recombinase can be used to remove selectable markers or other introduced transgenes that are no longer desired and therefore can be a useful tool for genome engineering in plants.
