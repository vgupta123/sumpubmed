BACKGROUND
wc <dig> co-receptors are group b scavenger receptor cysteine-rich molecules that are found exclusively on γδt cells and are thought to be encoded by a multi-gene family. previous studies have shown γδt cells that respond to a particular stimulus have unique wc <dig> molecules expressed. prior to the onset of the studies described here only one full-length wc <dig> nucleotide sequence was publicly available, though three wc <dig> molecules had been distinguished based on monoclonal antibody reactivity. furthermore, the number of wc <dig> genes found in the bovine genome and their sequences had not yet been resolved.


RESULTS
by annotating the bovine genome btau_ <dig>  assembly, here we show the existence of  <dig> members in the wc <dig> gene family and their organization within two loci on chromosome  <dig> including three distinct exon-intron gene structures one of which coded for a potentially more primitive and smaller wc <dig> molecule that is similar to the swine wc <dig> gene. we also provide cdna evidence as verification for many of the annotated sequences and show transcripts for isoforms derived by alternative splicing.


CONCLUSIONS
it is possible that wc <dig> diversity contributes to functional differences that have been observed between γδt cell populations. the studies described here demonstrate that wc <dig> molecules are encoded by a large, multi-gene family whose transcripts undergo extensive alternative splicing. similar to other non-rearranging immunoreceptors, it is likely that the wc <dig> gene repertoire underwent expansion in order to keep pace with rapidly changing ligands.
