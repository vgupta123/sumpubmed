BACKGROUND
the potyviruses sugarcane mosaic virus  and maize dwarf mosaic virus  are major pathogens of maize worldwide. two loci, scmv <dig> and scmv <dig>  have ealier been shown to confer complete resistance to scmv. custom-made microarrays containing previously identified scmv resistance candidate genes and resistance gene analogs were utilised to investigate and validate gene expression and expression patterns of isogenic lines under pathogen infection in order to obtain information about the molecular mechanisms involved in maize-potyvirus interactions.


RESULTS
by employing time course microarray experiments we identified  <dig> significantly differentially expressed sequences within the different time points. the majority of differentially expressed genes differed between the near-isogenic line carrying scmv <dig> resistance locus at chromosome  <dig> and the other isogenic lines. most differentially expressed genes in the scmv experiment  were identified one hour after virus inoculation, and about one quarter at multiple time points. furthermore, most of the identified mapped genes were localised outside the scmv qtl regions. annotation revealed differential expression of promising pathogenesis-related candidate genes, validated by qrt-pcr, coding for metallothionein-like protein, s-adenosylmethionine synthetase, germin-like protein or 26s ribosomal rna.


CONCLUSIONS
our study identified putative candidate genes and gene expression patterns related to resistance to scmv. moreover, our findings support the effectiveness and reliability of the combination of different expression profiling approaches for the identification and validation of candidate genes. genes identified in this study represent possible future targets for manipulation of scmv resistance in maize.
