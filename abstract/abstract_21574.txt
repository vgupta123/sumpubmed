BACKGROUND
resistin, a member of adipokine family, is known to be involved in the modulation of immune responses including inflammatory activity. interestingly, resistin is secreted by adipocytes in mice and rats whereas it is secreted by leukocytes in humans. however, the mechanism behind the effect of resistin on the expansion of regulatory t cells  remains poorly understood. therefore, we examined regulatory effect of resistin on the induction and cellular modification of tregs.


RESULTS
both protein and mrna expression of foxp <dig>  a representative marker of tregs, increased in a dose-dependent manner when peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with resistin. at the same time, resistin had no direct effect on the induction of foxp <dig> in cd4+ t cells, suggesting an indirect role through other cells type. since dcs are an important player in the differentiation of t cells, we focused on the role of dcs in the modulation of tregs by resistin. resistin suppressed the expression of interferon regulatory factor - <dig> and its target cytokines, il- <dig>  il-23p <dig> and il-12p <dig>  in dcs. furthermore, foxp <dig> expression is increased in cd4+ t cells when co-cultured with dcs and concomitantly treated with resistin.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that resistin induces expansion of functional tregs only when co-cultured with dcs.
