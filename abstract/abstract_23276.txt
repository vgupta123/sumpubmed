BACKGROUND
there has been a considerable increase in studies investigating rates of diversification and character evolution, with one of the promising techniques being the bisse method . this study uses simulations under a variety of different sample sizes  and asymmetries of rate  to determine bisseâ€™s ability to test hypotheses, and investigate whether the method is susceptible to confounding effects.


RESULTS
we found that the power of the bisse method is severely affected by both sample size and high tip ratio bias . sample size and high tip ratio bias also reduced accuracy and precision of parameter estimation, and resulted in the inability to infer which rate asymmetry caused the excess of a character state. in low tip ratio bias scenarios with appropriate tip sample size, bisse accurately estimated the rate asymmetry causing character state excess, avoiding the issue of confounding effects.


CONCLUSIONS
based on our findings, we recommend that future studies utilizing bisse that have fewer than  <dig> terminals and/or have datasets where high tip ratio bias is observed  should be extremely cautious with the interpretation of hypothesis testing results.
