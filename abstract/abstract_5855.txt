BACKGROUND
revealing genetic mechanisms behind specific physiological characteristics of saccharomyces cerevisiae from specific environments is important for industrial applications and requires precise understanding.


RESULTS
maotai strain mt <dig> was isolated from the complicated chinese maotai-flavored liquor-making environment with extremely high temperatures, and acidic and ethanol stresses. compared with the type strain s288c, mt <dig> can tolerate high acidity , high ethanol levels  and high temperatures . in addition, mt <dig> can simultaneously utilize various sugars, including glucose, sucrose, galactose, maltose, melibiose, trehalose, raffinose and turanose. genomic comparisons identified a distinct mt <dig> genome,  <dig>  mb smaller than that of s288c. there are  <dig> mt1-specific genes that are not in s288c, including mel <dig>  mal <dig>  khr <dig>  bio <dig> and bio <dig>  a transcriptional comparison indicated that hxt <dig> and hxt <dig>  which are theoretically repressed by glucose, were no longer inhibited in mt <dig> and were highly expressed even in a medium containing 70 g/l glucose. thus, other sugars may be co-utilized with glucose by mt <dig> without diauxic growth.


CONCLUSIONS
based on a functional genomics analysis, we revealed the genetic basis and evolutionary mechanisms underlying the traits of the chinese maotai-flavored yeast mt <dig>  this work provides new insights for the genetic breeding of yeast and also enriches the genetic resources of yeast.
