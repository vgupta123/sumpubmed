BACKGROUND
plants have evolved disease resistance  genes encoding for nucleotide-binding site  and leucine-rich repeat  proteins with n-terminals represented by either toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor  or coiled-coil  domains. here, a genome-wide study of presence and diversification of cc-nb-lrr and tir-nb-lrr encoding genes, and shorter domain combinations in  <dig> arabidopsis thaliana accessions and arabidopsis lyrata, capsella rubella, brassica rapa and eutrema salsugineum are presented.


RESULTS
out of  <dig> r genes analyzed,  <dig> cc-nb-lrr and  <dig> tir-nb-lrr genes were conserved among the  <dig> a. thaliana genotypes, while only two cc-nb-lrrs, including zar <dig>  and three tir-nb-lrrs were conserved when comparing the five species. the resistance to leptosphaeria maculans  <dig>  locus confers resistance to the brassica pathogen l. maculans the causal agent of blackleg disease and has undergone conservation and diversification events particularly in b. rapa. on the contrary, the rlm <dig> locus important in the immune response towards botrytis cinerea and alternaria spp. has recently evolved in the arabidopsis genus.


CONCLUSIONS
our genome-wide analysis of the r gene repertoire revealed a large sequence variation in the  <dig> cruciferous genomes. the data provides further insights into evolutionary processes impacting this important gene family.
