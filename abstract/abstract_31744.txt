BACKGROUND
plasmodium vivax reticulocyte binding protein- <dig>  is a promising candidate for development of vaccine against parasite. dna sequence polymorphism in pvrbp- <dig> which may hamper the vaccine development program has been identified in laboratory strains. therefore, unraveling genetic polymorphism in pvrbp- <dig> from field isolates is a prerequisite for success in vaccine development. this study was designed with a primary aim to uncover genetic polymorphism in pvrbp- <dig> among p. vivax field isolates.


RESULTS
using virtual restriction mapping of pvrbp- <dig> sequences, two restriction enzymes  were selected for the development of pvrbp- <dig> as a pcr-rflp marker. restriction fragment length polymorphism  analysis revealed a high degree of genetic polymorphism in the pvrbp- <dig> gene among field isolates of p. vivax. apoi-rflp was found to be more efficient in identifying the extent of genetic polymorphism in pvrbp- <dig> compared to alui-rflp. combined genotyping/haplotyping of rflp pattern revealed a total of  <dig> distinct rflp patterns among  <dig> p. vivax isolates analyzed. dna sequence analysis also supports high degree of genetic polymorphism among field isolates of p. vivax. pvrbp- <dig> pcr-rflp method is able to distinguish multiple infection up to  <dig> % and it revealed a low level of shared genetic pool between more than two populations.


CONCLUSIONS
the study suggests that pvrbp- <dig> is highly polymorphic genetic marker which can be used for population genetic analyses. rflp analysis suggests presence of nearly similar proportion of sal- <dig> and belem alleles in indian p. vivax populations. the larger extent of genetic polymorphism identified from limited samples advocates to screen genetic polymorphism in pvrbp- <dig> from malaria endemic geographical regions and countries for designing pvrbp- <dig> based anti-malarial control measures.
