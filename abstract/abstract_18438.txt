BACKGROUND
in  <dig>  a novel h7n <dig> avian influenza virus  was isolated from ill humans in shanghai and anhui province, china. since then, the virus has spread quickly throughout china. previous isolation of h7n <dig> virus from swine suggests that additional h <dig> subtype aivs may be transmitted through pigs. however, prior to the recent zoonosis of h7n <dig>  there were very few studies on the seroprevalence of the h <dig> subtypes in this species. thus, there is a need to perform serological surveys for novel h7n <dig> as well as other h <dig> subtype aivs in swine. this surveillance may help us understand risk factors for outbreaks of influenza a  virus.


RESULTS
only  <dig> %  of the pig sera had antibodies with an hi titer ≥1: <dig>  and none had an mn titer ≥1: <dig>  against the h <dig> antigen. thus, no samples were found to be positive against h7n <dig>  however,  <dig> %  of the pig sera had antibodies with hi titer ≥1: <dig> and  <dig> %  by mn titer ≥1: <dig> against h <dig> antigen. thirty-seven percent  of the pig sera had antibodies with hi titer ≥1: <dig> and  <dig> %  had mn titer ≥1: <dig> against pandemic  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
pigs in southern china have been shown to be infected with multiple avian influenza viruses. as the prevalence of novel influenza a viruses  may be increasing among poultry in china, similar seroepidemiological studies of pigs should be conducted in the future.
