BACKGROUND
the tropical ascomycete trichoderma reesei  represents one of the most efficient plant cell wall degraders. regulation of the enzymes required for this process is affected by nutritional signals as well as other environmental signals including light.


RESULTS
our transcriptome analysis of strains lacking the photoreceptors blr <dig> and blr <dig> as well as env <dig> revealed a considerable increase in the number of genes showing significantly different transcript levels in light and darkness compared to wild-type. we show that members of all glycoside hydrolase families can be subject to light dependent regulation, hence confirming nutrient utilization including plant cell wall degradation as a major output pathway of light signalling. in contrast to n. crassa, photoreceptor mediated regulation of carbon metabolism in t. reesei occurs primarily by blr <dig> and blr <dig> via their positive effect on induction of env <dig> transcription, rather than by a presumed negative effect of env <dig> on the function of the blr complex. nevertheless, genes consistently regulated by photoreceptors in n. crassa and t. reesei are significantly enriched in carbon metabolic functions. hence, different regulatory mechanisms are operative in these two fungi, while the light dependent regulation of plant cell wall degradation appears to be conserved.

analysis of growth on different carbon sources revealed that the oxidoreductive d-galactose and pentose catabolism is influenced by light and env <dig>  transcriptional regulation of the target enzymes in these pathways is enhanced by light and influenced by env <dig>  blr <dig> and/or blr <dig>  additionally we detected an env1-regulated genomic cluster of  <dig> genes including the d-mannitol dehydrogenase gene lxr <dig>  with two genes of this cluster showing consistent regulation in n. crassa.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that one major output pathway of light signalling in trichoderma reesei is regulation of glycoside hydrolase genes and the degradation of hemicellulose building blocks. targets of env <dig> and blr1/blr <dig> are for the most part distinct and indicate individual functions for env <dig> and the blr complex besides their postulated regulatory interrelationship.
