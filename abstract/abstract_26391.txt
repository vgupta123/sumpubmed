BACKGROUND
incorrectly annotated sequence data are becoming more commonplace as databases increasingly rely on automated techniques for annotation. hence, there is an urgent need for computational methods for checking consistency of such annotations against independent sources of evidence and detecting potential annotation errors. we show how a machine learning approach designed to automatically predict a protein's gene ontology  functional class can be employed to identify potential gene annotation errors.


RESULTS
in a set of  <dig> previously annotated mouse protein kinases, we found that  <dig> of the go annotations returned by amigo appear to be inconsistent with the uniprot functions assigned to their human counterparts. in contrast, 97% of the predicted annotations generated using a machine learning approach were consistent with the uniprot annotations of the human counterparts, as well as with available annotations for these mouse protein kinases in the mouse kinome database.


CONCLUSIONS
we conjecture that most of our predicted annotations are, therefore, correct and suggest that the machine learning approach developed here could be routinely used to detect potential errors in go annotations generated by high-throughput gene annotation projects.
