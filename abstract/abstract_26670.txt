BACKGROUND
traditional approaches to studying molecular networks are based on linking genes or proteins. higher-level networks linking gene sets or pathways have been proposed recently. several types of gene set networks have been used to study complex molecular networks such as co-membership gene set networks  and co-enrichment gene set networks . gene set networks are useful for studying biological mechanism of diseases and drug perturbations.


RESULTS
in this study, we proposed a new approach for constructing directed, regulatory gene set networks  to reveal novel relationships among gene sets or pathways. we collected several gene set collections and high-quality gene regulation data in order to construct r-gsns in a comparative study with co-membership gene set networks . we described a method for constructing both global and disease-specific r-gsns and determining their significance. to demonstrate the potential applications to disease biology studies, we constructed and analysed an r-gsn specifically built for alzheimer's disease.


CONCLUSIONS
r-gsns can provide new biological insights complementary to those derived at the protein regulatory network level or m-gsns. when integrated properly to functional genomics data, r-gsns can help enable future research on systems biology and translational bioinformatics.
