BACKGROUND
poly polymerase  <dig> , which catalyzes polyation of proteins by using nad+ as a substrate, plays a key role in several nuclear events, including dna repair, replication, and transcription. recently, parp- <dig> was reported to participate in the somatic cell reprogramming process. previously, we revealed a role for parp- <dig> in the induction of neural apoptosis in a cellular model of cerebral ischemia and suggested the possible use of parp inhibitors as a new therapeutic intervention. in the present study, we examined the effects of parp inhibitors on neural stem/progenitor cells  of the mouse brain.



RESULTS
parp- <dig> was more abundant and demonstrated higher activity in nspcs than in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. treatment with parp inhibitors suppressed the formation of neurospheres by nspcs through the suppression of cell cycle progression and the induction of apoptosis. in order to identify the genes responsible for these effects, we investigated gene expression profiles by microarray analyses and found that several genes in the p <dig> signaling pathway were upregulated, including cdkn1a, which is critical for cell cycle control, and fas, pidd, pmaip <dig>  and bbc <dig>  which are principal factors in the apoptosis pathway. inhibition of polyation increased the levels of p <dig> protein, but not p <dig> mrna, and enhanced the phosphorylation of p <dig> at ser <dig>  experiments with specific inhibitors and also shrna demonstrated that parp- <dig>  but not parp- <dig>  has a role in the regulation of p <dig>  the effects of parp inhibitors on nspcs were not observed in trp53
−/− nspcs, suggesting a key role for p <dig> in these events.


CONCLUSIONS
on the basis of the finding that parp inhibitors facilitated the p <dig> signaling pathway, we propose that polyation contributes to the proliferation and self-renewal of nspcs through the suppression of p <dig> activation.
