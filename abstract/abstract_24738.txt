BACKGROUND
canine mammary tumors represent the most common neoplasm in female dogs, and the discovery of cancer biomarkers and their translation to clinical relevant assays is a key requirement in the war on cancer. since the description of the ‘warburg effect’, the reprogramming of metabolic pathways is considered a hallmark of pathological changes in cancer cells. in this study, we investigate the expression of two cancer-related metabolic enzymes, transketolase  and transketolase-like  <dig> , involved in the pentose phosphate pathway , an alternative metabolic pathway for glucose breakdown that could promote cancer by providing the precursors and energy required for rapidly growing cells.


RESULTS
tkt and tktl <dig> protein expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry in canine normal  and hyperplastic glands , as well as in benign  and malignant mammary tumors . tkt expression was higher in hyperplastic lesions and in both benign and malignant tumors compared to the normal mammary gland, while tktl <dig> levels were remarkably higher in hyperplastic lesions, simple adenomas and simple carcinomas than in the normal mammary glands .


CONCLUSIONS
this study reveals that the expression of a key ppp enzyme varies along the evolution of canine mammary neoplastic lesions, and supports a role of metabolic changes in the development of canine mammary tumors.
