BACKGROUND
ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies in women, as it is frequently detected at an advanced stage, and cancers often become refractory to chemotherapy. evidence suggests that dysregulation of pro-apoptotic genes plays a key role in the onset of chemoresistance. the secreted frizzled-related protein  family is pro-apoptotic and also a negative modulator of the wnt signalling cascade. studies have demonstrated that the re-expression of sfrps, in particular sfrp <dig>  is associated with a better prognosis, and that experimentally induced expression results in cell death.


RESULTS
in vitro experimental models determined that sfrp <dig> was differentially expressed in chemosensitive  and chemoresistant  ovarian cell lines, with chemosensitive cells expressing significantly higher levels of sfrp <dig>  transfection of the chemoresistant cell lines with sfrp <dig> significantly increased their sensitivity to chemotherapy. conversely, silencing of sfrp <dig> expression in the chemosensitive cell line resulted in a corresponding increase in chemoresistance. comparison of sfrp <dig> expression in tumour biopsies revealed a positive trend between sfrp <dig> expression and tumour grade, with mucinous cyst adenocarcinomas exhibiting significantly decreased sfrp <dig> levels compared to mucinous borderline tumours.


CONCLUSIONS
this study indicates a role for sfrp <dig> as a predictive marker of chemosensitivity in ovarian cancer and suggests that this pathway may be worth exploiting for novel therapies.
