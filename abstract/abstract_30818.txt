BACKGROUND
protein ser/thr phosphatase ppp1cc <dig> is an alternatively spliced isoform of ppp1c that is highly enriched in testis and selectively expressed in sperm. addition of the phosphatase inhibitor toxins okadaic acid or calyculin a to caput and caudal sperm triggers and stimulates motility, respectively. thus, the endogenous mechanisms of phosphatase inhibition are fundamental for controlling sperm function and should be characterized. preliminary results have shown a protein phosphatase inhibitor activity resembling ppp1r <dig> in bovine and primate spermatozoa.


RESULTS
here we show conclusively, for the first time, that ppp1r <dig> is present in sperm. in addition, we have also identified a novel protein, ppp1r2p <dig>  the latter was previously thought to be an intron-less pseudogene. we show that the protein corresponding to the pseudogene is expressed. it has ppp <dig> inhibitory potency similar to ppp1r <dig>  the potential phosphosites in ppp1r <dig> are substituted by non-phosphorylable residues, t73p and s87r, in ppp1r2p <dig>  we also confirm that ppp1r2/ppp1r2p <dig> are phosphorylated at ser <dig> and ser <dig>  and report a novel phosphorylation site, ser <dig>  subfractionation of sperm structures show that ppp1cc <dig>  ppp1r2/ppp1r2p <dig> are located in the head and tail structures.


CONCLUSIONS
the conclusive identification and localization of sperm ppp1r <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> lays the basis for future studies on their roles in acrosome reaction, sperm motility and hyperactivation. an intriguing possibility is that a switch in ppp1cc <dig> inhibitory subunits could be the trigger for sperm motility in the epididymis and/or sperm hyperactivation in the female reproductive tract.
