BACKGROUND
barley seed proteins are of prime importance to the brewing industry, human and animal nutrition and in plant breeding for cultivar identification. to obtain comprehensive proteomic data from seeds, total protein from a two-rowed  and a six-rowed  barley cultivar were precipitated in acetone, digested in-solution, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.


RESULTS
the raw mass spectra data searched against uniprot’s barley database using in-house mascot search engine identified  <dig> unique proteins. gene ontology  analysis indicated that the majority of the seed proteins were cytosolic, with catalytic activity and associated with carbohydrate metabolism. spectral counting analysis showed that there are  <dig> differentially abundant seed proteins between the two-rowed conrad and six-rowed lacey cultivars.


CONCLUSIONS
this study paves the way for the use of a top-down gel-free proteomics strategy in barley for investigating more complex traits such as malting quality. differential abundance of hordoindoline proteins impact the seed hardness trait of barley cultivars.
