BACKGROUND
available in vitro and in vivo methods for verifying protein substrates for posttranslational modifications via farnesylation or geranylgeranylation  are time consuming , laborious and suffer from low sensitivity.


RESULTS
we describe a new technique for detecting prenyl anchors in n-terminally glutathione s-transferase -labeled constructs of target proteins expressed in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and incubated with 3h-labeled anchor precursors. alternatively, hemagglutinin -labeled constructs expressed in vivo  can be used. for registration of the radioactive marker, we propose to use a thin layer chromatography  analyzer. as a control, the protein yield is tested by western blotting with anti-gst-  antibodies on the same membrane that has been previously used for tlc-scanning. these protocols have been tested with rap2a, v-ki-ras <dig> and rhoa  including the necessary controls. we show directly that rasd <dig> is a farnesylation target.


CONCLUSIONS
savings in time for experimentation and the higher sensitivity for detecting 3h-labeled lipid anchors recommend the tlc-scanning method with purified gst-  tagged target proteins as the method of choice for analyzing their prenylation capabilities in vitro and in vivo and, possibly, also for studying the myristoyl and palmitoyl posttranslational modifications.
