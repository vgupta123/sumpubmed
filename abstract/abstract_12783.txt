BACKGROUND
tsetse flies, vectors of african trypanosomes, undergo viviparous reproduction . this reproductive strategy results in a large maternal investment and the deposition of a small number of progeny during a female's lifespan. the reproductive biology of tsetse has been studied on a physiological level; however the molecular analysis of tsetse reproduction requires deeper investigation. to build a foundation from which to base molecular studies of tsetse reproduction, a cdna library was generated from female tsetse  reproductive tissues and the intrauterine developmental stages.  <dig> expressed sequence tags were sequenced and analyzed.


RESULTS
analysis of a nonredundant catalogue of  <dig> contigs resulted in  <dig> predicted proteins.  <dig> of these proteins were full length. we predict that  <dig> of these represent cytoplasmic proteins while  <dig> are secreted. comparison of these proteins with other tissue specific tsetse cdna libraries  identified  <dig> that are unique to the reproductive/immature cdna library.  <dig> unique proteins were homologus to uncharacterized putative proteins within the nr database suggesting the identification of novel genes associated with reproductive functions in other insects . the analysis also yielded seven putative proteins without significant homology to sequences present in the public database . these proteins may represent unique functions associated with tsetse's viviparous reproductive cycle. rt-pcr analysis of hypothetical conserved and unknown contigs was performed to determine basic tissue and stage specificity of the expression of these genes.


CONCLUSIONS
this paper identifies  <dig> putative proteins specific to a tsetse reproductive/immature est library.  <dig> of these proteins correspond to hypothetical conserved genes and  <dig> proteins are tsetse specific.
