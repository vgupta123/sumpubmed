BACKGROUND
stem cells are thought to play a critical role in minimizing the accumulation of mutations, but it is not clear which strategies they follow to fulfill that performance objective. slow cycling of stem cells provides a simple strategy that can minimize cell pedigree depth and thereby minimize the accumulation of replication-dependent mutations. although the power of this strategy was recognized early on, a quantitative assessment of whether and how it is employed by biological systems is missing.


RESULTS
here we address this problem using a simple self-renewing organ – the c. elegans gonad – whose overall organization is shared with many self-renewing organs. computational simulations of mutation accumulation characterize a tradeoff between fast development and low mutation accumulation, and show that slow-cycling stem cells allow for an advantageous compromise to be reached. this compromise is such that worm germ-line stem cells should cycle more slowly than their differentiating counterparts, but only by a modest amount. experimental measurements of cell cycle lengths derived using a new, quantitative technique are consistent with these predictions.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings shed light both on design principles that underlie the role of stem cells in delaying aging and on evolutionary forces that shape stem-cell gene regulatory networks.
