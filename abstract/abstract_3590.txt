BACKGROUND
haplotype reconstruction is important in linkage mapping and association mapping of quantitative trait loci . one widely used statistical approach for haplotype reconstruction is simulated annealing , implemented in simwalk <dig>  however, the algorithm needs a very large number of sequential iterations, and it does not clearly show if convergence of the likelihood is obtained.


RESULTS
an evolutionary algorithm  is a good alternative whose convergence can be easily assessed during the process. it is feasible to use a powerful parallel-computing strategy with the ea, increasing the computational efficiency. it is shown that the ea can be ~ <dig> times faster and gives more reliable estimates than simwalk <dig> when using  <dig> processors. in addition, jointly updating dependent variables can increase the computational efficiency up to ~ <dig> times. overall, the proposed method with  <dig> processors increases the computational efficiency up to ~ <dig> times compared to simwalk <dig>  the efficiency will increase more with a larger number of processors.


CONCLUSIONS
the use of the evolutionary algorithm and the joint updating method can be a promising tool for haplotype reconstruction in linkage and association mapping of qtl.
