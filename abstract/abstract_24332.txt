BACKGROUND
the prevalence of drug-resistant bacteria has encouraged the search for novel antimicrobial compounds. food-associated microorganisms, as a source of new antibiotics, have recently received considerable attention. the objective of this study was to find novel antimicrobial agents produced by food microorganisms.


RESULTS
a bacterial strain b <dig>  which has potent antimicrobial activity, was isolated from a sample of dairy waste. this strain was identified as paenibacillus ehimensis based on the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, physiological and biochemical characterization. two active compounds  were obtained from p. ehimensis b <dig>  mass spectrometry  analysis showed that the molecular masses of pe <dig> and pe <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig>  da, respectively. the tandem ms and amino acid analysis indicated that pe <dig> and pe <dig> were analogs of polypeptin, and pe <dig> was characterized as a new member of this family. both compounds were active against all tested bacterial pathogens, including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pan-drug resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate. time-kill assays demonstrated that at 4 × mic , pe <dig> and pe <dig> rapidly reduced the number of viable cells by at least 3-orders of magnitude, indicating that they were bactericidal antibiotics.


CONCLUSIONS
in the present work, two cationic lipopeptide antibiotics  were isolated from p. ehimensis b <dig> and characterized. these two peptides showed broad antimicrobial activity against all tested human pathogens and are worthy of further study.
