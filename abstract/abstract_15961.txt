BACKGROUND
multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii  is associated with nosocomial infections worldwide. to date, the use of a phage to prevent infections caused by mdrab has not been demonstrated.


RESULTS
the mdrab-specific phage ϕab <dig> was stable at 4°c and ph  <dig> in  <dig> % chloroform solution, and showed a slight decrease in plaque-forming units /ml of  <dig> – <dig>  log after  <dig> days of storage. the addition of ϕab <dig> at a concentration of at least  <dig> pfu/ml to an a. baumannii m <dig> suspension killed > <dig> % of a. baumannii m <dig> after  <dig> min, regardless of a. baumannii m <dig> concentration /ml). the addition of ϕab <dig> at a concentration of  <dig> pfu/slide  to glass slides containing a. baumannii m <dig> at  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> cfu/slide, significantly reduced bacterial numbers by 93%, 97%, and 99%, respectively. thus, this concentration is recommended for decontamination of glass surfaces. moreover, infusion of ϕab <dig> into 10% glycerol exhibited strong anti-mdrab activity , even after  <dig> days of storage. treatment of a 10% paraffin oil-based lotion with ϕab <dig> significantly reduced  a. baumannii m <dig> after  <dig> day of storage. however, ϕab <dig> had no activity in the lotion after  <dig> month of storage.


CONCLUSIONS
phages may be useful for reducing mdrab contamination in liquid suspensions or on hard surfaces. phages may also be inoculated into a solution to produce an antiseptic hand wash. however, the phage concentration and incubation time  should be carefully considered to reduce the risk of mdrab contamination.
