BACKGROUND
cell-cycle-related proteins, such as cyclins or cyclin-dependent kinases, may have functions beyond that of cell cycle regulation. the expression and translocation of cyclind1-cdk <dig> in post-mitotic neurons indicate that they may have supplementary functions in differentiated neurons that might be associated with neuronal plasticity.


RESULTS
in the present study, our findings showed that the expression of cdk <dig> was localized mostly in nuclei and cytoplasm of pyramidal cells of ca <dig> at postnatal day  <dig> ; whereas at p <dig> staining of cdk <dig> could be detected predominantly in the cytoplasm but not nuclei. basal synaptic transmission was normal in the presence of cdk <dig> inhibitor. short-term synaptic plasticity  was impaired in cdk <dig> inhibitor pre-treated slices both from neonatal  and adolescent  animals; however there was no significant change in paired-pulse facilitation  in slices pre-incubated with the cdk <dig> inhibitor from adolescent animals. by the treatment of cdk <dig> inhibitor, the induction or the maintenance of long-term potentiation  in response to a strong tetanus and nmda receptor-dependent long-term depression  were normal in hippocampus. however, long-term depression  induced either by group i metabotropic glutamate receptors  agonist or by paired-pulse low-frequency stimulation  was impaired in cdk <dig> inhibitor pretreated slices both from neonatal and adolescent animals. but the effects of the cdk <dig> inhibitor at slices from adolescent animals were not as robust as at slices from neonatal animals.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicated that the activation of cyclind1-cdk <dig> is required for short-term synaptic plasticity and mglur-dependent ltd, and suggested that this cyclin-dependent kinase may have different roles during the postnatal development in mice hippocampus area ca <dig>
