BACKGROUND
from a human health viewpoint, contaminated milk and its products could be a source of long-term exposure to toxic metals. simple, inexpensive, and on-site assays would enable constant monitoring of their contents. bioassays that can measure toxic metals in milk or yoghurt might reduce the risk. for this purpose, the green fluorescent protein -tagged trans factors, arsr-gfp and cadc-gfp, together with their cis elements were used to develop such bioassays.


RESULTS
arsr-gfp or cadc-gfp, which binds either toxic metal or dna fragment including cis element, was directly mixed with cowâ€™s milk or yoghurt within a neutral ph range. the fluorescence of gfp, which is reflected by the association/dissociation ratio between cis element and trans factor, significantly changed with increasing externally added as  or cd  whereas smaller responses to externally added pb  and zn  were found. preparation and dilution of whey fraction at low ph were essential to intrinsic zinc quantification using cadc-gfp. using the extraction procedure and bioassay, intrinsic zn  concentrations ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/l for milk brands and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/kg for yoghurt brands were determined, which correlated to those determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy.


CONCLUSIONS
gfp-tagged bacterial trans factors and cis elements can work in the neutralized whole composition and diluted whey fraction of milk and yoghurt. the feature of regulatory elements is advantageous for establishment of simple and rapid assays of toxic metals in dairy products.
