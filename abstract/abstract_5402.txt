BACKGROUND
2-phenylethanl  and its derivatives are important chemicals, which are widely used in food materials and fine chemical industries and polymers and it’s also a potentially valuable alcohol for next-generation biofuel. however, the biosynthesis of 2-pe are mainly biotransformed from phenylalanine, the price of which barred the production. therefore, it is necessary to seek more sustainable technologies for 2-pe production.


RESULTS
a new strain which produces 2-pe through the phenylpyruvate pathway was isolated and identified as enterobacter sp. cgmcc  <dig>  the strain is able to use renewable monosaccharide as the carbon source and nh4cl as the nitrogen source to produce 2-pe. two genes of rate-limiting enzymes, chorismate mutase p-prephenate dehydratase  and 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate synthase , were cloned from escherichia coli and overexpressed in e. sp. cgmcc  <dig>  the engineered e. sp. cgmcc  <dig> produces  <dig>  mg l- <dig> 2-pe in 12 h, which is  <dig>  times as high as the wild strain.


CONCLUSIONS
the phenylpyruvate pathway and the substrate specificity of 2-keto-acid decarboxylase towards phenylpyruvate were found in e. sp. cgmcc  <dig>  combined with the low-cost monosaccharide as the substrate, the finding provides a novel and potential way for 2-pe production.
