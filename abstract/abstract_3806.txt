BACKGROUND
adipose tissues contain populations of pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells that also secrete various cytokines and growth factors to support repair of damaged tissues. in this study, we examined the role of oxidative stress on human adipose-derived multilineage progenitor cells  in neurite outgrowth in cells of the rat pheochromocytoma cell line .


RESULTS
we found that glutathione depletion in hadmpcs, caused by treatment with buthionine sulfoximine , resulted in the promotion of neurite outgrowth in pc <dig> cells through upregulation of bone morphogenetic protein  <dig>  and fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  transcription in, and secretion from, hadmpcs. addition of n-acetylcysteine, a precursor of the intracellular antioxidant glutathione, suppressed the bso-mediated upregulation of bmp <dig> and fgf <dig>  moreover, bso treatment caused phosphorylation of p <dig> mapk in hadmpcs. inhibition of p <dig> mapk was sufficient to suppress bmp <dig> and fgf <dig> expression, while this expression was significantly upregulated by overexpression of a constitutively active form of mkk <dig>  which is an upstream molecule from p <dig> mapk.


CONCLUSIONS
our results clearly suggest that glutathione depletion, followed by accumulation of reactive oxygen species, stimulates the activation of p <dig> mapk and subsequent expression of bmp <dig> and fgf <dig> in hadmpcs. thus, transplantation of hadmpcs into neurodegenerative lesions such as stroke and parkinsonâ€™s disease, in which the transplanted hadmpcs are exposed to oxidative stress, can be the basis for simple and safe therapies.
