BACKGROUND
mozambique is one of the countries with the highest burden of tuberculosis  in sub-saharan africa, and information on the predominant genotypes of mycobacterium tuberculosis circulating in the country are important to better understand the epidemic. this study determined the predominant strain lineages that cause tb in mozambique.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> m. tuberculosis isolates from seven different provinces of mozambique were characterized by spoligotyping and resulting profiles were compared with the international spoligotyping database sitvit <dig> 

the four most predominant lineages observed were: the latin-american mediterranean ; the east african-indian ; an evolutionary recent but yet ill-defined t clade, ; and the globally-emerging beijing clone, . a high spoligotype diversity was found for the eai, lam and t lineages.


CONCLUSIONS
the tb epidemic in mozambique is caused by a wide diversity of spoligotypes with predominance of lam, eai, t and beijing lineages.
