BACKGROUND
the formation of the pre-initiation complex in eukaryotic genes is a key step in transcription initiation. the tata-binding protein  is a universal component of all pre-initiation complexes for all kinds of rna polymerase ii  genes, including those with a tata or a tata-like element, both those that encode proteins and those that transcribe non-coding rnas. mot <dig> and the negative cofactor  <dig>  complex are regulators of tbp, and it has been shown that depletion of these factors in yeast leads to defects in the control of transcription initiation that alter cryptic transcription levels in selected yeast loci.


RESULTS
in order to cast light on the molecular functions of nc <dig>  we performed genome-wide studies in conditional mutants in yeast nc <dig> essential subunits ydr <dig> and bur <dig>  our analyses show a generally increased level of cryptic transcription in all kinds of genes upon depletion of nc <dig> subunits, and that each kind of gene  shows some differences in the cryptic transcription pattern for each nc <dig> mutant.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that nc <dig> plays a general role in transcription initiation in rna polymerase ii genes that is related with its known tbp interchange function from free to promoter bound states. therefore, loss of the nc <dig> function provokes increases in cryptic transcription throughout the yeast genome. our results also suggest functional differences between nc <dig> subunits ydr <dig> and bur <dig>
