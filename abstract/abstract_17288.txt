BACKGROUND
dna polymerases α and δ play essential roles in the replication of chromosomal dna in eukaryotic cells. dna polymerase α -primase is required to prime synthesis of the leading strand and each okazaki fragment on the lagging strand, whereas dna polymerase δ  is required for the elongation stages of replication, a function it appears capable of performing on both leading and lagging strands, at least in the absence of dna polymerase ε .


RESULTS
here it is shown that the catalytic subunit of pol α, pol <dig>  interacts with cdc <dig>  one of three non-catalytic subunits of fission yeast pol δ, both in vivo and in vitro. pol <dig> interacts with the c-terminal domain of cdc <dig>  at a site distinct from the previously identified binding sites for cdc <dig> and pcna. comparative protein sequence analysis identifies a protein sequence motif, called the dna polymerase interaction motif , in cdc <dig> orthologues from a wide variety of eukaryotic species, including mammals. mutational analysis shows that the dpim in fission yeast cdc <dig> is not required for effective dna replication, repair or checkpoint function.


CONCLUSIONS
the absence of any detectable phenotypic consequences arising from mutation of the dpim suggests that despite its evolutionary conservation, the interaction between the two polymerases mediated by this motif is a non-essential one.
