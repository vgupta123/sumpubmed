BACKGROUND
ion channels are involved in the control of membrane potential  in a variety of cells. the maintenance of ψ in human t lymphocytes is essential for t-cell activation and was suggested to depend mostly on the voltage-gated kv <dig>  channel. blockage of kv <dig>  inhibits cytokine production and lymphocyte proliferation in vitro and suppresses immune response in vivo. t lymphocytes are a heterogeneous cell population and the expression of kv <dig>  varies among cell subsets. oxonol diba-c4- was used to determine ψ by flow cytometry. the presence of distinct t cell subsets was evaluated by immunophenotyping techniques and the contribution of kv <dig>  channels for the maintenance of ψ was investigated using selective blockers.


RESULTS
the distribution of ψ in t lymphocytes varied among blood donors and did not always follow a unimodal pattern. t lymphocytes were divided into cd3+/cd45ro- and cd3+/cd45ro+ subsets, whose peak channel values of ψ were - <dig> ±  <dig>  mv and - <dig> ±  <dig>  mv, respectively. mgtx  had no significant effect in the ψ of cd3+/cd45ro- subsets but depolarized cd3+/cd45ro+ cells to - <dig> ±  <dig>  mv.


CONCLUSIONS
combination of optical methods for determination of ψ by flow cytometry with immuophenotyping techniques opens new possibilities for the study of ion channels in the biology of heterogeneous cell populations such as t lymphocyte subsets.
