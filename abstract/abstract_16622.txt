BACKGROUND
this study describes the ultrasonographic findings of the rumen in  <dig> healthy dairy cows.


RESULTS
the cows were scanned on both sides using a  <dig>  mhz transducer. the dorsal visible margin of the rumen ran parallel to the lung from cranioventral to caudodorsal. it was furthest from the dorsal midline at the 9th intercostal space  and closest at the 12th intercostal space . the longitudinal groove, which could be clearly identified at all examination sites because it appeared as a triangular notch, formed the ventral margin of the dorsal sac of the rumen. the dorsal sac of the rumen was largest at the caudal flank , where it was adjacent to the abdominal wall. the ventral sac of the rumen extended across the ventral midline into the right hemiabdomen and its ventral margin had a largely horizontal craniocaudal course. the height of the ventral sac of the rumen exceeded that of the dorsal sac at all examination sites; the maximum height was measured at the 12th intercostal space . the dorsal gas cap, characterised ultrasonographically by typical reverberation artifacts, was visible in all cows from the 12th intercostal space to the caudal flank. it was largest at the 12th intercostal space . the transition from the gas cap to the fibre mat was marked by the abrupt cessation of the reverberation artifacts. it was not possible to differentiate a fibre mat and a ventral fluid phase. the rumen could be imaged from the right side in  <dig> cows .


CONCLUSIONS
ultrasonography is well suited for the detailed examination of the rumen of cows. the reference values obtained from this study add to the diagnostic tools that are available for the assessment of bovine patients.
