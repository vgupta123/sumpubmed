BACKGROUND
duchenne musclar dystrophy  is an x-linked recessive disease caused by mutations of dystrophin gene, there is no effective treatment for this disorder at present. plasmid-mediated gene therapy is a promising therapeutical approach for the treatment of dmd. one of the major issues with plasmid-mediated gene therapy for dmd is poor transfection efficiency and distribution. the herpes simplex virus protein vp <dig> has the capacity to spread from a primary transduced cell to surrounding cells and improve the outcome of gene transfer. to improve the efficiency of plasmid-mediated gene therapy and investigate the utility of the intercellular trafficking properties of vp22-linked protein for the treatment for dmd, expression vectors for c-terminal versions of vp22-microdystrophin fusion protein was constructed and the vp22-mediated shuttle effect was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo.


RESULTS
our results clearly demonstrate that the vp22-microdystrophin fusion protein could transport into c2c <dig> cells from 3t <dig> cells, moreover, the vp22-microdystrophin fusion protein enhanced greatly the amount of microdystrophin that accumulated following microdystrophin gene transfer in both transfected 3t <dig> cells and in the muscles of dystrophin-deficient  mice.


CONCLUSIONS
these results highlight the efficiency of the vp22-mediated intercellular protein delivery for potential therapy of dmd and suggested that protein transduction may be a potential and versatile tool to enhance the effects of gene delivery for somatic gene therapy of dmd.
