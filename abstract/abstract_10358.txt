BACKGROUND
eb <dig> is a microtubule tip-associated protein that interacts with the apc tumour suppressor protein and the p150glued subunit of dynactin. we previously reported that an eb <dig> deletion mutant that retains both of these interactions but does not directly associate with microtubules  spontaneously formed perinuclear aggregates when expressed in cos- <dig> cells.


RESULTS
in the present study live imaging indicated that eb1-Δn2-gfp aggregates underwent dynamic microtubule-dependent changes in morphology and appeared to be internally cohesive. eb1-Δn2-gfp aggregates were phase-dense structures that displayed microtubule-dependent accumulation around the centrosome, were immunoreactive for both the 20s subunit of the proteasome and ubiquitin, and induced the collapse of the vimentin cytoskeleton. fractionation studies revealed that a proportion of eb1-Δn2-gfp was detergent-insoluble and ubiquitylated, indicating that eb1-Δn2-gfp aggregates are aggresomes. immunostaining also revealed that apc and p150glued were present in eb1-Δn2-gfp aggregates, whereas eb <dig> was not. furthermore, evidence for p150glued degradation was found in the insoluble fraction of eb1-Δn2-gfp transfected cultures.


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that aggresomes can be internally cohesive and may not represent a simple "aggregate of aggregates" assembled around the centrosome. our observations also indicate that a partially misfolded protein may retain the ability to interact with its normal physiological ligands, leading to their co-assembly into aggresomes. this supports the idea that the trapping and degradation of co-aggregated proteins might contribute to human pathologies characterised by aggresome formation.
