BACKGROUND
toxoplasmosis is caused by the apicomplexan parasite toxoplasma gondii and can be acquired either congenitally or via the oral route. in the latter case, transmission is mediated by two distinct invasive stages, i.e., bradyzoites residing in tissue cysts or sporozoites contained in environmentally resistant oocysts shed by felids in their feces. the oocyst plays a central epidemiological role, yet this stage has been scarcely investigated at the molecular level and the knowledge of its expressed proteome is very limited.


RESULTS
using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled to liquid chromatography-linked tandem mass spectrometry, we analysed total or fractionated protein extracts of partially sporulated t. gondii oocysts, producing a dataset of  <dig> non reduntant proteins , ~59% of which were classified according to the mips functional catalogue database. notably, the comparison of the oocyst dataset with the extensively covered proteome of t. gondii tachyzoite, the invasive stage responsible for the clinical signs of toxoplasmosis, identified  <dig> putative oocyst/sporozoite-specific proteins, some of which were validated by western blot. the analysis of this protein subset showed that, compared to tachyzoites, oocysts have a greater capability of de novo amino acid biosynthesis and are well equipped to fuel the krebs cycle with the acetyl-coa generated through fatty acid Î²-oxidation and the degradation of branched amino acids.


CONCLUSIONS
the study reported herein significantly expanded our knowledge of the proteome expressed by the oocyst/sporozoite of t. gondii, shedding light on a stage-specifc subset of proteins whose functional profile is consistent with the adaptation of t. gondii oocysts to the nutrient-poor and stressing extracellular environment.
