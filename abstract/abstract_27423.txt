BACKGROUND
listeria monocytogenes , a foodborne pathogen, can cause pregnancy failure in animals, especially in ruminants. recent studies have shown that lm activates inflammasomes to induce il-1β release in macrophages, however, whether the inflammasome activation regulates lm-induced pregnancy failure remains largely unknown. here we used mouse model to investigate the molecular mechanism by which lm-induced inflammsome activation contributes to lm-associated pregnancy failure


RESULTS
we showed that wild-type, but not listeriolysin o-deficient  lm, significantly reduced mouse embryo survival, accompanied by the increase of il-1β release and caspase- <dig> activation. il-1β neutralization significantly reduced the lm-induced embryo losses, suggesting that lm-induced pregnancy failure was associated with llo-induced inflammasome activation. to dissect the inflammasome sensor and components responsible for lm-induced caspase- <dig> activation and il-1β production, we used wild-type and nlrp3−/−, aim2−/−, nlrc4−/−, asc−/−, caspase-1−/− and cathepsin b−/− mouse macrophages to test the roles of these molecules in lm-induce il-1β production. we found that nlrp <dig> inflammasome was the main pathway in lm-induced caspase- <dig> activation and il-1β production. to explore the mechanism of lm-induced pregnancy failure, we investigated the effects of lm-infected macrophages on sm9- <dig> mouse trophoblasts. we found that the conditioned medium from lm-infected-macrophage or the recombinant il-1β significantly up-regulated tnfα, il- <dig> and il- <dig> productions in trophoblasts, suggesting that the lm-induced macrophage inflammasome activation increased trophoblast pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which was adverse to the animal pregnancy maintenance.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrated that the llo-induced nlrp <dig> inflammasome activation plays a key role in lm-induced pregnancy failure, and inflammasome-mediated macrophage dysregulation on trophoblasts might be involved in the pregnancy failure.
