BACKGROUND
active pre-mrna splicing occurs co-transcriptionally, and takes place throughout the nucleoplasm of eukaryotic cells. splicing decisions are controlled by networks of nuclear rna-binding proteins and their target sequences, sometimes in response to signalling pathways. sam <dig>  is the prototypic member of the star  family of rna-binding proteins, which regulate splicing in response to signalling cascades. nuclear sam <dig> protein is concentrated within subnuclear organelles called slm/sam <dig> nuclear bodies , which also contain some other splicing regulators, signalling components and nucleic acids.


RESULTS
we used proteomics to search for the major interacting protein partners of nuclear sam <dig>  in addition to sam <dig> itself and known sam68-associated proteins , we identified hnrnp l as a novel sam68-interacting protein partner. hnrnp l protein was predominantly present within small nuclear protein complexes approximating to the expected size of monomers and dimers, and was quantitatively associated with nucleic acids. hnrnp l spatially co-localised with sam <dig> as a novel component of snbs and was also observed within the general nucleoplasm. localisation within snbs was highly specific to hnrnp l and was not shared by the closely-related hnrnp ll protein, nor any of the other sam68-interacting proteins we identified by proteomics. the interaction between sam <dig> and hnrnp l proteins was observed in a cell line which exhibits low frequency of snbs suggesting that this association also takes place outside snbs. although ectopic expression of hnrnp l and sam <dig> proteins independently affected splicing of cd <dig> variable exon v <dig> and tjp <dig> exon  <dig> minigenes, these proteins did not, however, co-operate with each other in splicing regulation of these target exons.


CONCLUSIONS
here we identify hnrnp l as a novel snb component. we show that, compared with other identified sam68-associated hnrnp proteins and hnrnp ll, this co-localisation within snbs is specific to hnrnp l. our data suggest that the novel sam68-hnrnp l protein interaction may have a distinct role within snbs.
