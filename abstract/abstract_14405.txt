BACKGROUND
riemerella anatipestifer infection is a contagious disease that has resulted in major economic losses in the duck industry worldwide. this study attempted to characterize crispr-cas systems in the disease-causing agent, riemerella anatipestifer . the crispr-cas system provides adaptive immunity against foreign genetic elements in prokaryotes and crispr-cas loci extensively exist in the genomes of archaea and bacteria. however, the structure characteristics of r. anatipestifer crispr-cas systems remains to be elucidated due to the limited availability of genomic data.


RESULTS
to identify the structure and components associated with crispr-cas systems in r. anatipestifer, we performed comparative genomic analysis of crispr-cas systems in  <dig> r. anatipestifer strains using high-throughput sequencing. the results showed that most of the r. anatipestifer strains  that were analyzed have two crispr loci . crispr <dig> was shown to be flanked on one side by cas genes, while crispr <dig> was designated as an orphan. the other analyzed strains harbored only one locus, either crispr <dig> or crispr <dig>  the length and content of consensus direct repeat sequences, as well as the length of spacer sequences associated with the two loci, differed from each other. only three cas genes  were located upstream of crispr <dig>  crispr <dig> was also shown to be flanked by a 107 bp-long putative leader sequence and a 16 nt-long anti-repeat sequence. combined with analysis of spacer organization similarity and phylogenetic tree of the r. anatipestifer strains, crispr arrays can be divided into different subgroups. the diversity of spacer organization was observed in the same subgroup. in general, spacer organization in crispr <dig> was more divergent than that in crispr <dig>  additionally, only 8 % of spacers  were homologous with phage or plasmid sequences. the cas operon flanking crispr <dig> was observed to be relatively conserved based on multiple sequence alignments of cas amino acid sequences. the phylogenetic analysis associated with cas <dig> showed cas <dig> sequence from r. anatipestifer was closely related to that of bacteroides fragilis and formed part of the subtype ii-c subcluster.


CONCLUSIONS
our data revealed for the first time the structural features of r. anatipestifer crispr-cas systems. the illumination of structural features of crispr-cas system may assist in studying the specific mechanism associated with crispr-mediated adaptive immunity and other biological functions in r. anatipestifer.
