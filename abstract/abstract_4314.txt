BACKGROUND
the commonly invoked cost-benefit paradigm, central to most of functional biology, explains why one phenotype cannot be optimally fit in all environments; yet it is rarely tested. trypsin proteinase inhibitors  expression in nicotiana attenuata is known to decrease plant fitness when plants compete with unattacked conspecifics that do not produce tpis and also to decrease the performance of attacking herbivores.


RESULTS
in order to determine whether the putative benefits of tpi production outweigh its cost, we transformed n. attenuata to silence endogenous tpi production or restore it in a natural mutant that was unable to produce tpis. we compared the lifetime seed production of n. attenuata genotypes of the same genetic background with low or no tpi to that of genotypes with high tpi levels on which m. sexta larvae were allowed to feed freely. unattacked low tpi-producing genotypes produced more seed capsules than did plants with high tpi levels. caterpillar attack reduced seed capsule production in all genotypes and reversed the pattern of seed capsule production among genotypes. m. sexta larvae attacking genotypes with high tpi activity consumed more tpi, less protein, and move later to the young leaves. larval masses were negatively correlated  with seed capsule production per plant.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that the fitness benefits of tpi production outweigh their costs in greenhouse conditions, when plants are attacked and that despite the ongoing evolutionary interactions between plant and herbivore, tpi-mediated decreases in m. sexta performance translates into a fitness benefit for the plant.
