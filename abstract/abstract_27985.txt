BACKGROUND
previous studies confirmed that classical scrapie can be transmitted via milk in sheep. the current study aimed to investigate whether scrapie can also be transmitted via goat milk using in vivo  and in vitro methods .


RESULTS
in an initial pilot study, new-born lambs of two different prion protein gene  genotypes  were orally challenged with 5 g brain homogenate from two scrapie-affected goats to determine susceptibility of sheep to goat scrapie. all sheep challenged with goat scrapie brain became infected based on the immunohistochemical detection of disease-associated prp  in lymphoid tissue, with an arq/arq sheep being the first to succumb. subsequent feeding of milk to eight pairs of new-born arq/arq lambs, with each pair receiving milk from a different scrapie-affected goat, resulted in scrapie in the six pairs that received the largest volume of milk , whereas two pairs fed 8– <dig> litres per lamb, and an environmental control group raised on sheep milk from healthy ewes, did not show evidence of infection when culled at up to 1882 days of age. infection in those  <dig> milk recipients occurred regardless of the clinical status, prpsc distribution, caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus infection status and prnp polymorphisms at codon  <dig>  of the donor goats, but survival time was influenced by prnp polymorphisms at codon  <dig>  serial pmca applied to a total of  <dig> milk samples  detected prpsc in one sample each from two goats.


CONCLUSIONS
the scrapie agent was present in the milk from infected goats and was able to transmit to susceptible species even at early preclinical stage of infection, when prpsc was undetectable in the brain of the donor goats. serial pmca as a prpsc detection method to assess the risk of scrapie transmission via milk in goats proved inefficient compared to the bioassay.
