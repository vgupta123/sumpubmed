BACKGROUND
prophages, integral components of many bacterial genomes, play significant roles in cognate host bacteria, such as virulence, toxin biosynthesis and secretion, fitness cost, genomic variations, and evolution. many prophages and prophage-like elements present in sequenced bacterial genomes, such as bifidobacteria, lactococcus and streptococcus, have been described. however, information for the prophage of mycobacterium remains poorly defined.


RESULTS
in this study, based on the search of the complete genome database from genbank, the whole genome shotgun  databases, and some published literatures, thirty-three prophages were described in detail. eleven of them were full-length prophages, and others were prophage-like elements. eleven prophages were firstly revealed. they were phimav_ <dig>  phimav_ <dig>  phimmcs_ <dig>  phimmcs_ <dig>  phimkms_ <dig>  phimkms_ <dig>  phibn42_ <dig>  phibn44_ <dig>  phimcan_ <dig>  phimycsm_ <dig>  and phiw7s_ <dig>  their genomes and gene contents were firstly analyzed. furthermore, comparative genomics analyses among mycobacterioprophages showed that full-length prophage phi172_ <dig> belonged to mycobacteriophage cluster a and the phimmcs_ <dig>  phimkms_ <dig>  phibn44_ <dig>  and phimcan_ <dig> shared high homology and could be classified into one group.


CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first systematic characterization of mycobacterioprophages, their genomic organization and phylogeny. this information will afford more understanding of the biology of mycobacterium.
