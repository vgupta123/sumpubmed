BACKGROUND
in vivo tissue regeneration depends on migration of stem cells into injured areas, their differentiation into specific cell types, and their interaction with other cells that are necessary to generate new tissue. human mesenchymal stem cells, a subset of bone marrow stromal cells , can migrate and differentiate into osteoblasts in bone tissue. this can be facilitated by recombinant growth factors and cytokines. in many animal species, the availability of genomic sequences, recombinant proteins, and/or antibodies is limited so that new approaches are needed to generate resources that facilitate migration of stem cells into tissue defect areas. here we used bone marrow stromal cells of human, ovine, equine, and canine origin to generate hypoxia-conditioned media  in order to attract bmscs of the respective species in migration assays.


RESULTS
we show that hcm contain attractors even more potent than vascular endothelial growth factor and can therefore be used in many animal species without the need for purified proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
generation of hcm is easy and cheap compared to preparation and purification of protein fractions and/or recombinant proteins. hence, hcm could be applied in large animals  for attraction of bmscs into tissue defects caused by tumor resection or trauma.
