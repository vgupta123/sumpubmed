BACKGROUND
long interspersed nuclear elements  have been recently implicated in the regulation of mammalian transcriptomes.


RESULTS
here, we show that members of the three active mouse l <dig> subfamilies  contain, in addition to those on their sense strands, conserved functional splice sites on their antisense strands, which trigger multiple exonization events. the latter is particularly intriguing in the light of the strong antisense orientation bias of intronic l1s, implying that the toleration of antisense insertions results in an increased potential for exonization.


CONCLUSIONS
in a genome-wide analysis, we have uncovered evidence suggesting that the mobility of the large number of retrotransposition-competent mouse l1s  has significant potential to shape the mouse transcriptome by continuously generating insertions into transcriptional units.
