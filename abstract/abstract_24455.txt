BACKGROUND
models of foot and mouth disease  transmission have assumed a homogeneous landscape across which euclidean distance is a suitable measure of the spatial dependency of transmission. this paper investigated features of the landscape and their impact on transmission during the period of predominantly local spread which followed the implementation of the national movement ban during the  <dig> uk fmd epidemic. in this study  <dig> farms diagnosed with fmd which had a known source of infection within  <dig> km  were matched to  <dig> control farms which were either uninfected or infected at a later timepoint. cases were matched to controls by euclidean distance to the source of infection and farm size. intervening geographical features and connectivity between the source of infection and case and controls were compared.


RESULTS
road distance between holdings, access to holdings, presence of forest, elevation change between holdings and the presence of intervening roads had no impact on the risk of local fmd transmission . however the presence of linear features in the form of rivers and railways acted as barriers to fmd transmission .


CONCLUSIONS
this paper demonstrated that although fmd spread can generally be modelled using euclidean distance and numbers of animals on susceptible holdings, the presence of rivers and railways has an additional protective effect reducing the probability of transmission between holdings.
