BACKGROUND
sphingosine-1-phosphate  is a bioactive lipid that regulates a multitude of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, survival, migration and angiogenesis. s1p mediates its effects either by signaling through g protein-coupled receptors  or through an intracellular mode of action. in this study, we have investigated the mechanism behind s1p-induced survival signalling.


RESULTS
we found that s1p protected cells from fasl-induced cell death in an nf-κb dependent manner. nf-κb was activated by extracellular s1p via s1p <dig> receptors and gi protein signaling. our study also demonstrates that extracellular s1p stimulates cells to rapidly produce and secrete additional s1p, which can further amplify the nf-κb activation.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose a self-amplifying loop of autocrine s1p with capacity to enhance cell survival. the mechanism provides increased understanding of the multifaceted roles of s1p in regulating cell fate during normal development and carcinogenesis.
