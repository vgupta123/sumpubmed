BACKGROUND
the terpenoid indole alkaloid  pathway leads to the production of pharmaceutically important drugs, such as the anticancer compounds vinblastine and vincristine. unfortunately, these drugs are produced in trace amounts, causing them to be very costly. to increase production of these drugs, an improved understanding of the tia regulatory pathway is needed. towards this end, transgenic catharanthus roseus hairy roots that overexpress the orca <dig> tia transcriptional activator were generated and characterized.


RESULTS
transcriptional profiling experiments revealed that overexpression of orca <dig> results in altered expression of key genes from the indole and terpenoid pathways, which produce precursors for the tia pathway, and from the tia pathway itself. in addition, metabolite-profiling experiments revealed that overexpression of orca <dig> significantly affects the levels of several tia metabolites. orca <dig> overexpression also causes significant increases in transcript levels of several tia regulators, including tia transcriptional repressors.


CONCLUSIONS
results presented here indicate that orca <dig> plays a critical role in regulation of tia metabolism. orca <dig> regulates expression of key genes from both feeder pathways, as well as the genes  encoding the enzymes that catalyze the first two steps in tia biosynthesis. orca <dig> may play an especially important role in regulation of the downstream branches of the tia pathway, as it regulates four out of five genes characterized from this part of the pathway. regulation of tia transcriptional repressors by orca <dig> may provide a mechanism whereby increases in tia metabolite levels in response to external stimuli are transient and limited in magnitude.
