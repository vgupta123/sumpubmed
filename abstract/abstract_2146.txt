BACKGROUND
the carbonic anhydrases  are involved in inorganic carbon utilization. they have been classified into six evolutionary and structural families: α-, β-, γ-, δ-, ε-, ζ- cas, with β-cas present in higher plants, algae and prokaryotes. the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a single copy of β-ca nce103/ynl036w.


RESULTS
we determined the crystal structure of nce <dig> in complex with a substrate analog at  <dig>  Å resolution. it assembles as a homodimer, with the active site located at the interface between two monomers. at the bottom of the substrate pocket, a zinc ion is coordinated by the three highly conserved residues cys <dig>  his <dig> and cys <dig> in addition to a water molecule. residues asp <dig>  arg <dig>  gly <dig>  leu <dig>  val <dig>  phe <dig> and phe <dig> form a tunnel to the bottom of the active site which is occupied by a molecule of the substrate analog acetate. activity assays of full length and two truncated versions of nce <dig> indicated that the n-terminal arm is indispensable.


CONCLUSIONS
the quaternary structure of nce <dig> resembles the typical plant type β-cas of known structure, with an n-terminal arm indispensable for the enzymatic activity. comparative structure analysis enables us to draw a possible tunnel for the substrate to access the active site which is located at the bottom of a funnel-shaped substrate pocket.
