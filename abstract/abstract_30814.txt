BACKGROUND
vibrational spectroscopic imaging is now used in several fields to acquire molecular information from microscopically heterogeneous systems. recent advances have led to promising applications in tissue analysis for cancer research, where chemical information can be used to identify cell types and disease. however, recorded spectra are affected by the morphology of the tissue sample, making identification of chemical structures difficult.


RESULTS
extracting features that can be used to classify tissue is a cumbersome manual process which limits this technology from wide applicability. in this paper, we describe a method for interactive data mining of spectral features using gpu-based manipulation of the spectral distribution.


CONCLUSIONS
this allows researchers to quickly identify chemical features corresponding to cell type. these features are then applied to tissue samples in order to visualize the chemical composition of the tissue without the use of chemical stains.
