BACKGROUND
rhodobacter sphaeroides is one of the best studied purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacteria and serves as an excellent model for the study of photosynthesis and the metabolic capabilities of this and related facultative organisms. the ability of r. sphaeroides to produce hydrogen , polyhydroxybutyrate  or other hydrocarbons, as well as its ability to utilize atmospheric carbon dioxide  as a carbon source under defined conditions, make it an excellent candidate for use in a wide variety of biotechnological applications. a genome-level understanding of its metabolic capabilities should help realize this biotechnological potential.


RESULTS
here we present a genome-scale metabolic network model for r. sphaeroides strain  <dig> . <dig>  designated irsp <dig>  consisting of  <dig>  genes,  <dig> metabolites and  <dig> reactions, including r. sphaeroides-specific biomass reactions developed in this study. constraint-based analysis showed that irsp <dig> agreed well with experimental observations when modeling growth under respiratory and phototrophic conditions. genes essential for phototrophic growth were predicted by single gene deletion analysis. during pathway-level analyses of r. sphaeroides metabolism, an alternative route for co <dig> assimilation was identified. evaluation of photoheterotrophic h <dig> production using irsp <dig> indicated that maximal yield would be obtained from growing cells, with this predicted maximum ~50% higher than that observed experimentally from wild type cells. competing pathways that might prevent the achievement of this theoretical maximum were identified to guide future genetic studies.


CONCLUSIONS
irsp <dig> provides a robust framework for future metabolic engineering efforts to optimize the solar- and nutrient-powered production of biofuels and other valuable products by r. sphaeroides and closely related organisms.
