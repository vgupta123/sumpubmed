BACKGROUND
the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5a  promotes formation of the first peptide bond at the onset of protein synthesis. however, the function of eif5a in plants is not well understood.


RESULTS
in this study, we characterized the function of eif5a  from tamarix androssowii. the promoter of taeif5a <dig> with  <dig> â€‰bp in length was isolated, and the cis-elements in the promoter were identified. a wrky  and rav  protein can specifically bind to a w-box motif in the promoter of taeif5a <dig> and activate the expression of taeif5a <dig>  furthermore, taeif5a <dig>  tawrky and tarav share very similar expression pattern and are all stress-responsive gene that functions in the abscisic acid  signaling pathway, indicating that they are components of a single regulatory pathway. transgenic yeast and poplar expressing taeif5a <dig> showed elevated protein levels combined with improved abiotic stresses tolerance. furthermore, taeif5a1-transformed plants exhibited enhanced superoxide dismutase  and peroxidase  activities, lower electrolyte leakage and higher chlorophyll content under salt stress.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggested that taeif5a <dig> is involved in abiotic stress tolerance, and is likely regulated by transcription factors tawrky and tarav both of which can bind to the w-box motif. in addition, taeif5a <dig> may mediate stress tolerance by increasing protein synthesis, enhancing ros scavenging by improving sod and pod activities, and preventing chlorophyll loss and membrane damage. therefore, eif5a may play an important role in plant adaptation to changing environmental conditions.
