BACKGROUND
cell disruption strategies by high pressure homogenizer for the release of recombinant hepatitis b surface antigen  from pichia pastoris expression cells were optimized using response surface methodology  based on the central composite design . the factors studied include number of passes, biomass concentration and pulse pressure. polynomial models were used to correlate the above mentioned factors to project the cell disruption capability and specific protein release of hbsag from p. pastoris cells.


RESULTS
the proposed cell disruption strategy consisted of a number of passes set at  <dig> times, biomass concentration of  <dig>  g/l of dry cell weight  and pulse pressure at  <dig>  bar. the optimized cell disruption strategy was shown to increase cell disruption efficiency by 2-fold and 4-fold for specific protein release of hbsag when compared to glass bead method yielding  <dig> % cell disruption rate  and hbsag concentration of  <dig>  mg/l respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the model equation generated from rsm on cell disruption of p. pastoris was found adequate to determine the significant factors and its interactions among the process variables and the optimum conditions in releasing hbsag when validated against a glass bead cell disruption method. the findings from the study can open up a promising strategy for better recovery of hbsag recombinant protein during downstream processing.
