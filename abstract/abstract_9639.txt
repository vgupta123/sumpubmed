BACKGROUND
the monolignol biosynthetic pathway interconnects with the biosynthesis of other secondary phenolic metabolites, such as cinnamic acid derivatives, flavonoids and condensed tannins. the objective of this study is to evaluate whether genetic modification of the monolignol pathway in silver birch  would alter the metabolism of these phenolic compounds and how such alterations, if exist, would affect the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis.


RESULTS
silver birch lines expressing quaking aspen  caffeate/5-hydroxyferulate o-methyltransferase  under the 35s cauliflower mosaic virus  promoter showed a reduction in the relative expression of a putative silver birch comt  gene and, consequently, a decrease in the lignin syringyl/guaiacyl composition ratio. alterations were also detected in concentrations of certain phenolic compounds. all ptcomt silver birch lines produced normal ectomycorrhizas with the ectomycorrhizal fungus paxillus involutus , and the formation of symbiosis enhanced the growth of the transgenic plants.


CONCLUSIONS
the down-regulation of bpcomt in the 35s-ptcomt lines caused a reduction in the syringyl/guaiacyl ratio of lignin, but no significant effect was seen in the composition or quantity of phenolic compounds that would have been caused by the expression of ptcomt under the 35s or ubb <dig> promoter. moreover, the detected alterations in the composition of lignin and secondary phenolic compounds had no effect on the interaction between silver birch and p. involutus.
