BACKGROUND
in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, homologous recombination is an accurate mechanism to generate genetic diversity, and it is also used to repair dna double strand-breaks. rad <dig> epistasis group genes involved in recombinational dna repair, including mre <dig>  rad <dig>  nsb1/xrs <dig>  rad <dig>  rad51c/rad <dig>  rad51b/rad <dig>  rad51d, xrcc <dig>  xrcc <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rad54b/rdh <dig> and rad <dig> genes, have been studied in human and yeast cells. notably, the rad <dig> recombinase catalyses strand transfer between a broken dna and its undamaged homologous strand, to allow damaged region repair. in protozoan parasites, homologous recombination generating antigenic variation and genomic rearrangements is responsible for virulence variation and drug resistance. however, in entamoeba histolytica the protozoan parasite responsible for human amoebiasis, dna repair and homologous recombination mechanisms are still unknown.


RESULTS
in this paper, we initiated the study of the mechanism for dna repair by homologous recombination in the primitive eukaryote e. histolytica using uv-c  irradiated trophozoites. dna double strand-breaks were evidenced in irradiated cells by tunel and comet assays and evaluation of the ehh2ax histone phosphorylation status. in e. histolytica genome, we identified genes homologous to yeast and human rad <dig> epistasis group genes involved in dna double strand-breaks repair by homologous recombination. interestingly, the e. histolytica rad <dig> epistasis group related genes were differentially expressed before and after uv-c treatment. next, we focused on the characterization of the putative recombinase ehrad <dig>  which conserves the typical architecture of reca/rad <dig> proteins. specific antibodies immunodetected ehrad <dig> protein in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. moreover, after dna damage, ehrad <dig> was located as typical nuclear foci-like structures in e. histolytica trophozoites. purified recombinant ehrad <dig> exhibited dna binding and pairing activities and exchanging reactions between homologous strands in vitro.


CONCLUSIONS
e. histolytica genome contains most of the rad <dig> epistasis group related genes, which were differentially expressed when dna double strand-breaks were induced by uv-c irradiation. in response to dna damage, ehrad <dig> protein is overexpressed and relocalized in nuclear foci-like structures. functional assays confirmed that ehrad <dig> is a bonafide recombinase. these data provided the first insights about the potential roles of the e. histolytica rad <dig> epistasis group genes and ehrad <dig> protein function in dna damage response of this ancient eukaryotic parasite.
