BACKGROUND
as a first step to explore the possible relationships existing between the effects of low oxygen pressure in the first trimester placenta and placental pathologies developing from mid-gestation, two subtracted libraries totaling  <dig> cdna clones were constructed. for achieving this, two reciprocal suppressive/subtractive hybridization procedures  were applied to early  human placental villi after incubation either in normoxic or in hypoxic conditions. the clones from both libraries  were spotted on nylon macroarrays. complex cdnas probes prepared from placental villi  were hybridized to the membranes.


RESULTS
three hundred and fifty nine clones presenting a hybridization signal above the background were sequenced and shown to correspond to  <dig> different genes. nine of these genes are mitochondrial, while  <dig> are nuclear. specific expression profiles characteristic of preeclampsia  could be identified, as well as profiles specific of intra-uterine growth retardation .

focusing on the chromosomal distribution of the fraction of genes that responded in at least one hybridization experiment, we could observe a highly significant chromosomal clustering of  <dig> genes into  <dig> chromosomal regions, four of which containing imprinted genes. comparative mapping data indicate that these imprinted clusters are maintained in synteny in mice, and apparently in cattle and pigs, suggesting that the maintenance of such syntenies is requested for achieving a normal placental physiology in eutherian mammals.


CONCLUSIONS
we could demonstrate that genes induced in pe were also genes highly expressed under hypoxic conditions , which was not the case for isolated iugr. highly expressed placental genes may be in syntenies conserved interspecifically, suggesting that the maintenance of such clusters is requested for achieving a normal placental physiology in eutherian mammals.
