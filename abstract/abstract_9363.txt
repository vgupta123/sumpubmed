BACKGROUND
systems biology markup language  is gaining broad usage as a standard for representing dynamical systems as data structures. the open source statistical programming environment r is widely used by biostatisticians involved in microarray analyses. an interface between sbml and r does not exist, though one might be useful to r users interested in sbml, and sbml users interested in r.


RESULTS
a model structure that parallels sbml to a limited degree is defined in r. an interface between this structure and sbml is provided through two function definitions: write.sbml() which maps this r model structure to sbml level  <dig>  and read.sbml() which maps a limited range of sbml level  <dig> files back to r. a published model of purine metabolism is provided in this sbml-like format and used to test the interface. the model reproduces published time course responses before and after its mapping through sbml.


CONCLUSIONS
list infrastructure preexisting in r makes it well-suited for manipulating sbml models. further developments of this sbml-r interface seem to be warranted.
