BACKGROUND
the mitochondrial dna  of the cloned sheep "dolly" and nine other ovine clones produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer  was reported to consist only of recipient oocyte mtdna without any detectable mtdna contribution from the nucleus donor cell. in cattle, mouse and pig several or most of the clones showed transmission of nuclear donor mtdna resulting in mitochondrial heteroplasmy. to clarify the discrepant transmission pattern of donor mtdna in sheep clones we analysed the mtdna composition of seven fetuses and five lambs cloned from fetal fibroblasts.


RESULTS
the three fetal fibroblast donor cells used for scnt harboured low mtdna copy numbers per cell . the ratio of donor to recipient oocyte mtdnas was determined using a quantitative amplification refractory mutation system  pcr . for quantification of snp variants with frequencies below  <dig> % we developed a restriction endonuclease-mediated selective quantitative pcr . we report the first cases  of recipient oocyte/nuclear donor mtdna heteroplasmy in scnt-derived ovine clones demonstrating that there is no species-effect hindering ovine nucleus-donor mtdna from being transmitted to the somatic clonal offspring. most of the heteroplasmic clones exhibited low-level heteroplasmy  indicating neutral transmission of parental mtdnas. high-level heteroplasmy  was observed in one case. this clone possessed a divergent recipient oocyte-derived mtdna genotype with three rare amino acid changes compared to the donor including one substitution at an evolutionary conserved site.


CONCLUSIONS
our study using state-of-the-art techniques for mtdna quantification, like arms-qpcr and the novel rems-qpcr, documents for the first time the transmission of donor mtdna into somatic sheep clones. mtdna heteroplasmy was detected in seven of  <dig> clones tested, whereby all but one case revealed less than 1% mtdna contribution from the nuclear donor cell suggesting neutral segregation.
