BACKGROUND
low-copy-number vectors of potential wide application in biotechnology need to encode stabilization modules ensuring their stable inheritance. the efficiency of stabilization may vary depending on the plasmid host so a thorough analysis of stabilization functions is required before use.


RESULTS
to facilitate such analysis highly unstable, mobilizable, broad-host-range  vectors based on rk <dig> replicon were constructed. the vectors are suitable for testing of various stabilization functions, including plasmid and chromosomal partitioning cassettes encoding parb homologues capable of spreading on dna. the xyle or lacz reporter systems facilitate easy monitoring of plasmid segregation.


CONCLUSIONS
the range of bhr vectors with different reporter cassettes and alternative mobilization systems expands their application in diverse bacterial species.
