BACKGROUND
during mouse development, the precursor cells that give rise to the auditory sensory organ, the organ of corti, are specified prior to embryonic day  <dig>  . subsequently, the sensory domain is patterned precisely into one row of inner and three rows of outer sensory hair cells interdigitated with supporting cells. both the restriction of the sensory domain and the patterning of the sensory mosaic of the organ of corti involve notch-mediated lateral inhibition and cellular rearrangement characteristic of convergent extension. this study explores the expression and function of a putative notch target gene.


RESULTS
we report that a putative notch target gene, hairy-related basic helix-loop-helix  transcriptional factor hey <dig>  is expressed in the cochlear epithelium prior to terminal differentiation. its expression is subsequently restricted to supporting cells, overlapping with the expression domains of two known notch target genes, hairy and enhancer of split homolog genes hes <dig> and hes <dig>  in combination with the loss of hes <dig> or hes <dig>  genetic inactivation of hey <dig> leads to increased numbers of mis-patterned inner or outer hair cells, respectively. surprisingly, the ectopic hair cells in hey <dig> mutants are accompanied by ectopic supporting cells. furthermore, hey2-/-;hes1-/- and hey2-/-;hes1+/- mutants show a complete penetrance of early embryonic lethality.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that hey <dig> functions in parallel with hes <dig> and hes <dig> in patterning the organ of corti, and interacts genetically with hes <dig> for early embryonic development and survival. our data implicates expansion of the progenitor pool and/or the boundaries of the developing sensory organ to account for patterning defects observed in hey <dig> mutants.
