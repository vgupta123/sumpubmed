BACKGROUND
the aim of the present study was to assess possible health effects of airway exposures to bacillus thuringiensis  based biopesticides in mice. endpoints were lung inflammation evaluated by presence of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid , clearance of bacteria from the lung lumen and histological alterations of the lungs. hazard identifications of the biopesticides were carried out using intratracheal  instillation, followed by an inhalation study. the two commercial biopesticides used were based on the bt. subspecies kurstaki and israelensis, respectively. groups of balb/c mice were i.t instilled with one bolus  per mouse) of either biopesticide. control mice were instilled with sterile water. balfs were collected and the inflammatory cells were counted and differentiated. the balfs were also subjected to cfu counts.


RESULTS
balf cytology showed an acute inflammatory response dominated by neutrophils  <dig> hours after instillation of biopesticide. four days after instillation, the neutrophil number was normalised and inflammation was dominated by lymphocytes and eosinophils, whereas  <dig> days after instillation, the inflammation was interstitially located with few inflammatory cells present in the lung lumen.

half of the instilled mice had remaining cfu recovered from balf  <dig> days after exposure. to gain further knowledge with relevance for risk assessment, mice were exposed to aerosols of biopesticide one hour per day for  <dig> ×  <dig> days. each mouse received  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu bt israelensis or  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu bt kurstaki per exposure. seventy days after end of the aerosol exposures,  <dig> out of  <dig> mice had interstitial lung inflammation. cfu could be recovered from  <dig> out of  <dig> mice  <dig> days after exposure to aerosolised bt kurstaki. plethysmography showed that inhalation of bt aerosol did not induce airway irritation.


CONCLUSIONS
repeated low dose aerosol exposures to commercial bt based biopesticides can induce sub-chronic lung inflammation in mice, which may be the first step in the development of chronic lung diseases. inhalation of bt aerosols does not induce airway irritation, which could explain why workers may be less inclined to use a filter mask during the application process, and are thereby less protected from exposure to bt spores.
