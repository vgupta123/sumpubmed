BACKGROUND
the superior colliculus, usually considered a visuomotor structure, is anatomically positioned to perform sensorimotor transformations in other modalities. while there is evidence for its potential participation in sensorimotor loops of the rodent vibrissa system, little is known about its functional role in vibrissa sensation or movement. in anesthetized rats, we characterized extracellularly recorded responses of collicular neurons to different types of vibrissa stimuli.


RESULTS
collicular neurons had large receptive fields . single units displayed responses with short latencies  and relatively large magnitudes . individual neurons could entrain to repetitive vibrissa stimuli delivered at â‰¤  <dig> hz, with little reduction in phase locking, even when response magnitude was decreased. neurons responded preferentially to vibrissa deflections at particular angles, with 43% of the cells having high  angular selectivity indices.


CONCLUSIONS
results are consistent with a proposed role of the colliculus in somatosensory-mediated orienting. these properties, together with the connections of the superior colliculus in sensorimotor loops, are consistent with its involvement in orienting, alerting and attentive functions related to the vibrissa system.
