BACKGROUND
the arabidopsis response regulator  <dig>  is one of two members of a recently defined novel group of two-component system  elements. tcss are stimulus perception and response modules of prokaryotic origin, which signal by a his-to-asp phosphorelay mechanism. in plants, tcs regulators are involved in hormone response pathways, such as those for cytokinin and ethylene. while the functions of the other tcs elements in arabidopsis, such as histidine kinases , histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins  and a-type and b-type arrs are becoming evident, the role of arr <dig> is poorly understood.


RESULTS
we present evidence that arr <dig> is a preferentially cytoplasmic protein, exclusively expressed in the chalaza of developing seeds. arr <dig> specifically interacts with ahp <dig>  ahp <dig> and ahp <dig> in yeast and living plant cells. two new loss-of-function alleles, arr22- <dig> and arr22- <dig>  were isolated and characterized. with respect to their morphology and metabolite status, no significant difference in the developing seeds of the arr <dig> mutants was observed compared to wild type. the genetic complementation of the arr <dig> mutants with a genomic arr <dig> fragment resulted in plants  with a pleiotropic phenotype of different penetrance. this phenotype was not observed when the phosphorylatable asp <dig> of arr <dig> was changed to either a dominant-active glu or a dominant-inactive asn. the phenotype of the arr22/garr <dig> plants was comparable to that of multiple ahk, ahp and b-type arr mutants.


CONCLUSIONS
our results favor the model that arr <dig> acts as a phospho-histidine phosphatase on specific ahps in the cytoplasm of arabidopsis chalaza cells. the lack of any aberrant morphological and metabolite phenotype in the seeds of the arr <dig> mutants indicates that arr <dig> is probably primarily responsible for the fine tuning of specific branches of chalaza-based tcs signalling. even when slightly mis-expressed, arr <dig> interferes with hormone homeostasis in non-chalaza tissues. our data indicate that the chromatin status might play a crucial role in maintaining the chalaza-restricted expression of arr <dig>
