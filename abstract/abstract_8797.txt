BACKGROUND
the major goal of the study was to compare the genetic programs utilized by the neuropoietic cytokine interleukin- <dig>  and the neurotrophin  nerve growth factor  for neuronal differentiation.


RESULTS
the designer cytokine hyper-il- <dig> in which il- <dig> is covalently linked to its soluble receptor s-il-6r as well as ngf were used to stimulate pc <dig> cells for  <dig> hours. changes in gene expression levels were monitored using affymetrix genechip technology. we found different expression for  <dig> genes in il-6- and  <dig> genes in ngf-treated pc <dig> cells as compared to unstimulated controls. the gene set shared by both stimuli comprises only  <dig> genes.

a key step is upregulation of growth factors and functionally related external molecules known to play important roles in neuronal differentiation. in particular, il- <dig> enhances gene expression of regenerating islet-derived  <dig> alpha , regenerating islet-derived  <dig> beta , growth differentiation factor  <dig> , platelet-derived growth factor alpha , growth hormone releasing hormone , adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide  and hepatocyte growth factor . ngf recruits gdf <dig> , transforming growth factor beta  <dig>  and brain-derived neurotrophic factor . both stimuli activate growth-associated protein  <dig>  indicating that pc <dig> cells undergo substantial neuronal differentiation.

moreover, il- <dig> activates the transcription factors retinoic acid receptor alpha  and early growth response  <dig>  known to play key roles in neuronal differentiation.

ingenuity biological function analysis revealed that completely different repertoires of molecules are recruited to exert the same biological functions in neuronal differentiation. major sub-categories include cellular growth and differentiation, cell migration, chemotaxis, cell adhesion, small molecule biochemistry aiming at changing intracellular concentrations of second messengers such as ca2+ and camp as well as expression of enzymes involved in posttranslational modification of proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
the current data provide novel candidate genes involved in neuronal differentiation, notably for the neuropoietic cytokine il- <dig>  our findings may also have impact on the clinical treatment of peripheral nerve injury. local application of a designer cytokine such as h-il- <dig> with drastically enhanced bioactivity in combination with nts may generate a potent reparative microenvironment.
