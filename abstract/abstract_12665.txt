BACKGROUND
nowadays, more and more novel enzymes can be easily found in the whole enzyme pool with the rapid development of genetic operation. however, experimental work for substrate screening of a new enzyme is laborious, time consuming and costly. on the other hand, many computational methods have been widely used in lead screening of drug design. seeing that the ligand-target protein system in drug design and the substrate-enzyme system in enzyme applications share the similar molecular recognition mechanism, we aim to fulfill the goal of substrate screening by in silico means in the present study.


RESULTS
a computer-aided substrate screening  system which was based on the enzyme structure was designed and employed successfully to help screen substrates of candida antarctica lipase b . in this system, restricted molecular docking which was derived from the mechanism of the enzyme was applied to predict the energetically favorable poses of substrate-enzyme complexes. thereafter, substrate conformation, distance between the oxygen atom of the alcohol part of the ester  and the hydrogen atom of imidazole of his <dig>  distance between the carbon atom of the carbonyl group of the compound and the oxygen atom of hydroxyl group of ser <dig> were used sequentially as the criteria to screen the binding poses.  <dig> out of  <dig> compounds were identified correctly for the enzyme by this screening system. such high accuracy guaranteed the feasibility and reliability of the cass system.


CONCLUSIONS
the idea of computer-aided substrate screening is a creative combination of computational skills and enzymology. although the case studied in this paper is tentative, high accuracy of the cass system sheds light on the field of computer-aided substrate screening.
