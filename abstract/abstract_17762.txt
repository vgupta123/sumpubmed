BACKGROUND
global gene expression profiles of bovine kidney epithelial cells regulated by sodium butyrate were investigated with high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. the bovine microarray with  <dig>  distinct 60mer oligonucleotides, each with  <dig> replicates, was designed and produced with maskless array synthesizer technology. these oligonucleotides represent approximately  <dig>  unique cattle sequences.


RESULTS
 <dig> genes significantly regulated by butyrate with a median false discovery rate  =  <dig> % were identified. the majority of these genes were repressed by butyrate and associated with cell cycle control. the expression levels of  <dig> selected genes identified by the microarray were confirmed using real-time pcr. the results from real-time pcr positively correlated  with the results from the microarray.


CONCLUSIONS
this study presented the genes related to multiple signal pathways such as cell cycle control and apoptosis. the profound changes in gene expression elucidate the molecular basis for the pleiotropic effects of butyrate on biological processes. these findings enable better recognition of the full range of beneficial roles butyrate may play during cattle energy metabolism, cell growth and proliferation, and possibly in fighting gastrointestinal pathogens.
