BACKGROUND
high-throughput sequencing technology is capable to identify novel short rnas in plant species. we used solexa sequencing to find new micrornas in one of the model legume species, barrel medic .


RESULTS
 <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained from two separate short rna libraries generated from total rna extracted from m. truncatula leaves, representing  <dig> , <dig> distinct sequences.  <dig> , <dig> reads were mapped to the available m. truncatula genome corresponding to  <dig>  distinct sequences.  <dig>  reads representing  <dig> conserved mirna families showed perfect matches to known mirnas. we also identified  <dig> novel mirna candidates that were potentially generated from  <dig> loci. nine of these loci produced eight distinct sequences, for which the mirna* sequences were also sequenced. these sequences were not described in other plant species and accumulation of these eight novel mirnas was confirmed by northern blot analysis. potential target genes were predicted for most conserved and novel mirnas.


CONCLUSIONS
deep sequencing of short rnas from m. truncatula leaves identified eight new mirnas indicating that specific mirnas exist in legume species.
