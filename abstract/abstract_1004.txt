BACKGROUND
in yeast, birds and mammals, the sapk-interacting protein  <dig>  gene product has been implicated as a component of the stress-activated protein kinase  signal transduction pathway. recently, sin <dig> has also been shown to interact with the carboxyl terminal end of the cytoplasmic domain of the ovine type i interferon receptor subunit  <dig> . however, the function of sin <dig> remains unknown. since sapk pathways are ancient and the ifn system is confined to vertebrates, the organization of the sin <dig> gene and the sequences of the sin <dig> protein have been compared across a wide taxonomic range of species.


RESULTS
sin <dig> is represented, apparently as a single gene, in all metazoan species and fungi but is not detectable in protozoa, prokaryotes, or plants. sin <dig> is highly conserved in vertebrates , which possess an interferon system, suggesting that it has been subjected to powerful evolutionary constraint that has limited its diversification.

sin <dig> possesses at least two unique sequences in its ifnar2-interacting region that are not represented in insects and other invertebrates. sequence alignment between vertebrates and insects revealed five sin <dig> strongly conserved domains , but an analysis of any of these domains failed to identify known functional protein motifs. scd iii, which is approximately  <dig> amino acids in length, is particularly highly conserved and is present in all the species examined, suggesting a conserved function from fungi to mammals. the coding region of the vertebrate sin <dig> gene encompasses  <dig> exon and  <dig> introns, while in c. elegans the gene consists of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns organized distinctly from those of vertebrates. in yeast and insects, sin <dig> is intronless.


CONCLUSIONS
the study reveals the phylogeny of a little studied gene which has recently been implicated in two important signal transduction pathways, one ancient , one relatively new .
