BACKGROUND
fmri studies focus on sub-cortical effects of acupuncture stimuli. the purpose of this study was to assess changes in primary somatosensory  activity over the course of different types of acupuncture stimulation. we used whole head magnetoencephalography  to map s <dig> brain response during  <dig> minutes of electroacupuncture  and acupressure . we further assessed how brain response changed during the course of stimulation.


RESULTS
evoked brain response to ea differed from ap in its temporal dynamics by showing clear contralateral m20/m <dig> peaks while the latter demonstrated temporal dispersion. both ea and ap demonstrated significantly decreased response amplitudes following five minutes of stimulation. however, the latency of these decreases were earlier in ea  than ap . time-frequency responses demonstrated early onset, event related synchronization , within the gamma band at ~70- <dig> ms and the theta band at ~50- <dig> ms post-stimulus. a prolonged event related desynchronization  of alpha and beta power occurred at ~100- <dig> ms post-stimulus. there was decreased beta erd at ~100- <dig> ms over the course of ea, but not ap.


CONCLUSIONS
both ea and ap demonstrated conditioning of si response. in conjunction with their subcortical effects on endogenous pain regulation, these therapies show potential for affecting s <dig> processing and possibly altering maladaptive neuroplasticity. thus, further investigation in neuropathic populations is needed.
