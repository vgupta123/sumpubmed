BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is the main pathogen that causes respiratory infections in children younger than five years. the increasing incidence of macrolide- and tetracycline-resistant pneumococci among children has been a serious problem in china for many years. the molecular characteristics of erythromycin-resistant pneumococcal isolates that were collected from pediatric patients younger than five years in beijing in  <dig> were analyzed in this study.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> pneumococcal isolates were collected. the resistance rates of all isolates to erythromycin and tetracycline were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. of the  <dig> erythromycin-resistant pneumococci,  <dig> % were non-susceptible to tetracycline. in addition,  <dig> % of the erythromycin-resistant isolates expressed both the ermb and mef genes, whereas  <dig> % expressed the ermb gene but not the mef gene. up to  <dig> % of the resistant isolates exhibited the cmlsb phenotype, and tn <dig> was the most common transposon present in approximately  <dig> % of the resistant isolates, followed by tn <dig>  with a proportion of  <dig> %. the dominant sequence types  in all erythromycin-resistant s. pneumoniae were st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , and st <dig> , whereas the prevailing serotypes were 19f , 23f ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and 6a . the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine  and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine  coverage of the erythromycin-resistant pneumococci among the children younger than five years were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. st <dig> and serotype 19a pneumococci were common in children aged  <dig> to 2â€‰years. cc <dig> was the most frequent clonal complex , which accounts for  <dig> % of all erythromycin-resistant isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
the non-invasive s. pneumoniae in children younger than five years in beijing presented high and significant resistance rates to erythromycin and tetracycline. the expressions of ermb and tetm genes were the main factors that influence pneumococcal resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline, respectively. majority of the erythromycin-resistant non-invasive isolates exhibited the cmlsb phenotype and carried the ermb, tetm, xis, and int genes, suggesting the spread of the transposons of the tn <dig> family. pcv <dig> provided higher serotype coverage in the childhood pneumococcal diseases caused by the erythromycin-resistant isolates better than pcv <dig>  further long-term surveys are required to monitor the molecular characteristics of the erythromycin-resistant s. pneumoniae in children.
