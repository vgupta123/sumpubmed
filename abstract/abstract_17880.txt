BACKGROUND
contagious agalactia  is one of the major animal health problems in small ruminants because of its economic significance. currently, four mycoplasma spp. have been associated with this syndrome: m. agalactiae, m. mycoides subsp. capri, m. capricolum subsp. capricolum and m. putrefaciens. their presence has been evaluated in several studies conducted in ca-endemic countries. however, previous spanish studies have been focused on caprine ca, and there is a knowledge gap regarding which mycoplasma species are present in sheep flocks from spain, which has the second highest number of sheep amongst the  <dig> european union member states. consequently, we investigated the presence and geographic distribution of the four ca-causing mycoplasmas in spanish dairy sheep farms. this is the first time such an investigation has been performed.


RESULTS
three hundred thirty nine out of  <dig> sheep flocks were positive for m. agalactiae by real time pcr  and  <dig> by microbiological identification . interestingly, all  <dig> milk samples assessed for the presence of m. mycoides subsp. capri, m. capricolum subsp. capricolum and m. putrefaciens tested negative. to evaluate the intermittent excretion of the pathogen in milk, we sampled  <dig> additional farms from  <dig> to  <dig> times, resulting that in  <dig> % of the cases a previously positive farm tested negative in a later sampling.


CONCLUSIONS
m. agalactiae was the only mycoplasma species detected in the study area showing a high frequency of presence and wide distribution. therefore, the establishment of a permanent surveillance network is advantageous, as well as the implementation of control and prevention measures to hinder the dissemination of m. agalactiae and to prevent the entrance of other mycoplasma species.
