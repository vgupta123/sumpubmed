BACKGROUND
verticillium dahliae is a fungal pathogen that infects a wide range of hosts. the only known genes for resistance to verticillium in the solanaceae are found in the tomato  ve locus, formed by two linked genes, ve <dig> and ve <dig>  to characterize the resistance response mediated by the tomato ve gene, we inoculated two nearly isogenic tomato lines, la <dig>  and la <dig> , with v. dahliae.


RESULTS
we found induction of h2o <dig> production in roots of inoculated plants, followed by an increase in peroxidase activity only in roots of inoculated resistant plants. phenylalanine-ammonia lyase  activity was also increased in resistant roots  <dig> hours after inoculation, while induction of pal activity in susceptible roots was not seen until  <dig> hours after inoculation. phenylpropanoid metabolism was also affected, with increases in ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, vanillin and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde contents in resistant roots after inoculation. six tomato pal cdna sequences  were found in the solgenes tomato est database. rt-pcr analysis showed that these genes were expressed in all organs of the plant, albeit at different levels. real-time rt-pcr indicated distinct patterns of expression of the different pal genes in v. dahliae-inoculated roots. phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> partial pal cdnas corresponding to  <dig> plant species grouped angiosperm pal sequences into four clusters, suggesting functional differences among the six tomato genes, with pal <dig> and pal <dig> presumably involved in lignification, and the remaining pal genes implicated in other biological processes.

an increase in the synthesis of lignins was found  <dig> and  <dig> days after inoculation in both lines; this increase was greater and faster to develop in the resistant line. in both resistant and susceptible inoculated plants, an increase in the ratio of guaiacyl/syringyl units was detected  <dig> days after inoculation, resulting from the lowered amount of syringyl units in the lignins of inoculated plants.


CONCLUSIONS
the interaction between the tomato and v. dahliae triggered a number of short- and long-term defensive mechanisms. differences were found between compatible and incompatible interactions, including onset of h2o <dig> production and activities of peroxidase and pal, and phenylpropanoid metabolism and synthesis of lignins.
