BACKGROUND
thrombolysis after acute ischemic stroke has only proven to be beneficial in a subset of patients. the soluble recombinant analogue of human thrombomodulin, solulin, was studied in an in vivo rat model of acute ischemic stroke.

methods
male sd rats were subjected to  <dig> hrs of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion . rats treated with solulin intravenously shortly before reperfusion were compared to rats receiving normal saline i.v. with respect to infarct volumes, neurological deficits and mortality. gene expression of il- <dig>  il-1β, tnf-α, mmp- <dig>  cd11b and gfap were semiquantitatively analyzed by rtpcr of the penumbra.


RESULTS
 <dig> hrs after reperfusion, rats were neurologically tested, euthanized and infarct volumes determined. solulin significantly reduced mean total , cortical , and basal ganglia  infarct volumes. hippocampal infarct volumes  were not significantly affected. solulin significantly downregulated the expression of il-1β , tnf-α , il- <dig> , and cd11b  in the infarcted cortex compared to controls.


CONCLUSIONS
solulin reduced mean total, cortical and basal ganglia infarct volumes and regulated a subset of cytokines and proteases after tmcao suggesting the potency of this compound for therapeutic interventions.
