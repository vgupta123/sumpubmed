BACKGROUND
dicer, ago <dig> and trbp are the minimum components of the human rna-induced silencing complex . while dicer and ago <dig> are rnases, trbp is the double-stranded rna binding protein  that loads small interfering rna into the risc. trbp binds directly to dicer through its c-terminal domain.


RESULTS
we show that the trbp binding site in dicer is a  <dig> amino acid  region located between the atpase and the helicase domains. the binding site in trbp is a  <dig> aa domain, called c <dig>  located at the c-terminal end of trbp. the trbp <dig> and trbp <dig> isoforms, but not trbps lacking the c <dig> site , co-immunoprecipitated with dicer. the c <dig> domain is therefore necessary to bind dicer, irrespective of the presence of rna. immunofluorescence shows that while full-length trbps colocalize with dicer, trbpsΔc <dig> do not. tarbp2-/- cells, which do not express trbp, do not support rna interference  mediated by short hairpin or micro rnas against egfp. both trbps, but not trbpsΔc <dig>  were able to rescue rnai function. in human cells with low rnai activity, addition of trbp <dig> or  <dig>  but not trbpsΔc <dig>  rescued rnai function.


CONCLUSIONS
the mapping of the interaction sites between trbp and dicer show unique domains that are required for their binding. since trbpsΔc <dig> do not interact or colocalize with dicer, we suggest that trbp and dicer, both dsrbps, do not interact through bound dsrna. trbps, but not trbpsΔc <dig>  rescue rnai activity in rnai-compromised cells, indicating that the binding of dicer to trbp is critical for rnai function.
