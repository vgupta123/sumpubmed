BACKGROUND
daphnia magna is a well-established model species in ecotoxicology, ecology and evolution. several new genomics tools are presently under development for this species; among them, a linkage map is a first requirement for estimating the genetic background of phenotypic traits in quantitative trait loci  studies and is also very useful in assembling the genome. it also enables comparative studies between d. magna and d. pulex, for which a linkage map already exists.


RESULTS
here we describe the first genetic linkage map of d. magna. we generated  <dig> f <dig>  clonal lines as the foundation of the linkage analysis. the linkage map itself is based on  <dig> microsatellite markers, which produced ten major linkage groups ranging in size from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm. the total size of this linkage map extends to  <dig>  kosambi cm, and the average interval for the markers within linkage groups is  <dig>  cm. the f <dig> clones can be used to map qtls for traits that differ between the parental clones. we successfully mapped the location of two loci with infertility alleles, one inherited from the paternal clone  and the other from the maternal clone .


CONCLUSIONS
the d. magna linkage map presented here provides extensive coverage of the genome and a given density of markers that enable us to detect qtls of moderate to strong effects. it is similar in size to the linkage map of d. pulex.
