BACKGROUND
two closely related ices, icest <dig> and icest <dig>  have been identified in the lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus. while their conjugation and recombination modules are almost identical  and their regulation modules related, previous work has demonstrated that transconjugants carrying icest <dig> were generated at rate exceeding by a  <dig> factor that of icest <dig> 


RESULTS
the functional regulation of icest <dig> and icest <dig> transcription, excision and replication were investigated under different conditions . analysis revealed an identical transcriptional organization of their recombination and conjugation modules  whereas the transcriptional organization of their regulation modules were found to be different  and to depend on the conditions . for both elements, stationary phase and dna damage lead to the rise of transcript levels of the conjugation-recombination and regulation modules. whatever the growth culture conditions, excision of icest <dig> was found to be lower than that of icest <dig>  which is consistent with weaker transfer frequencies. furthermore, for both elements, excision increases in stationary phase  and is strongly enhanced by dna damage . although ices are generally not described as replicative elements, the copy number of icest <dig> exhibited a sharp increase  after mitomycin c exposure of its harboring strain cnrz <dig>  this result was not observed when icest <dig> was introduced in a strain deriving icest <dig> host strain cnrz <dig>  deleted for this element. this finding suggests an impact of the host cell on ice behavior.


CONCLUSIONS
all together, these results suggest a novel mechanism of regulation shared by icest <dig>  icest <dig> and closely related ices, which we identified by analysis of recently sequenced genomes of firmicutes. this is the first report of a partial shutdown of the activity of an ice executed by a strain belonging to its primary host species. the sharp increase of icest <dig> copy number suggests an induction of replication; such conditional intracellular replication may be common among ices.
