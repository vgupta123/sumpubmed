BACKGROUND
genetic analysis of escherichia coli o157:h <dig> strains has shown divergence into two distinct lineages, lineages i and ii, that appear to have distinct ecological characteristics, with lineage i strains more commonly associated with human disease. in this study, microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization  was used to identify genomic differences among  <dig> e. coli o157:h <dig> strains that belong to various phage types  and different lineage-specific polymorphism assay  types.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  out of  <dig>  orfs were detected in all e. coli o157:h <dig> strains and  <dig>  were variably present or absent. based on this data, e. coli o157:h <dig> strains were divided into three distinct clusters, which consisted of  <dig> lineage i , four lineage i/ii   and  <dig> lineage ii strains , respectively. eleven different genomic regions that were dominant in lineage i strains  spanned segments containing as few as two and up to  <dig> orfs each. these regions were identified within e. coli sakai s-loops #  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  sakai phage  <dig>  and a genomic backbone region. all four lineage i/ii strains were of pt  <dig> and possessed eight of these  <dig> lineage i-dominant loci. several differences in virulence-associated loci were noted between lineage i and lineage ii strains, including divergence within s-loop  <dig>  which encodes shiga toxin  <dig>  and absence of the non-lee encoded effector genes nlef and nleh1- <dig> and the perc homologue gene pchd in lineage ii strains.


CONCLUSIONS
cgh data suggest the existence of two dominant lineages as well as lspa type and pt-related subgroups within e. coli o157:h <dig>  the genomic composition of these subgroups supports the phylogeny that has been inferred from other methods and further suggests that genomic divergence from an ancestral form and lateral gene transfer have contributed to their evolution. the genomic features identified in this study may contribute to apparent differences in the epidemiology and ecology of strains of different e. coli o157:h <dig> lineages.
