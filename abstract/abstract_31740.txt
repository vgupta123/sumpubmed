BACKGROUND
the  <dig> breeds of dog recognized by the american kennel club offer a unique opportunity to map genes important in genetic variation. each breed features a defining constellation of morphological and behavioral traits, often generated by deliberate crossing of closely related individuals, leading to a high rate of genetic disease in many breeds. understanding the genetic basis of both phenotypic variation and disease susceptibility in the dog provides new ways in which to dissect the genetics of human health and biology.


RESULTS
to facilitate both genetic mapping and cloning efforts, we have constructed an integrated canine genome map that is both dense and accurate. the resulting resource encompasses  <dig> markers, and was constructed using the rhdf5000- <dig> whole genome radiation hybrid panel. the radiation hybrid  map features a density of one marker every  <dig> kb and contains  <dig> bacterial artificial chromosome clones  localized to  <dig> unique positions,  <dig> of which have also been mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization . the two data sets show excellent concordance. excluding the y chromosome, the map features an rh/fish mapped bac every  <dig>  mb and an rh mapped bac-end, on average, every  <dig> mb. for  <dig> markers, the orthologous human genes have been established, allowing the identification of  <dig> conserved segments  between the dog and human genomes, dramatically extending the length of most previously described cs.


CONCLUSIONS
these results provide a necessary resource for the canine genome mapping community to undertake positional cloning experiments and provide new insights into the comparative canine-human genome maps.
