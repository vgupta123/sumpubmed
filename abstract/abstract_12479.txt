BACKGROUND
small rnas are known to regulate diverse gene expression processes including translation, transcription, and splicing. among small rnas, the micrornas  of  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides  undergo biogeneses including primary transcription, rna excision and folding, nuclear export, cytoplasmic processing, and then bioactivity as regulatory agents. we propose that analogous hairpins from rna molecules that function as part of the spliceosome might also be the source of small, regulatory rnas .


RESULTS
deep sequencing technology has enabled discovery of a novel 16-nt rna sequence in total rna from human brain that we propose is derived from rnu <dig>  an rna component of spliceosome assembly. bioinformatic alignments compel inquiring whether the novel 16-nt sequence or its precursor have a regulatory function as well as determining aspects of how processing intersects with the mirna biogenesis pathway. specifically, our preliminary in silico investigations reveal the sequence could regulate splicing factor arg/ser rich  <dig> , a gene coding an essential protein component of the spliceosome. all 16-base source sequences in the ucsc human genome browser are within the  <dig> instances of rnu <dig> genes listed in wgencodegencodeautov <dig>  furthermore,  <dig> of the  <dig> instances of the sequence are also within a common 28-nt hairpin-forming subsequence of rnu <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
an abundant 16-nt rna sequence is sourced from a spliceosomal rna, lies in a stem of a predicted rna hairpin, and includes reverse complements of subsequences of the 3'utr of a gene coding for a spliceosome protein. thus rnu <dig> could function both as a component of spliceosome assembly and as inhibitor of production of the essential, spliceosome protein coded by sfrs <dig>  beyond this example, a general procedure is needed for systematic discovery of multiple alignments of sequencing, splicing, and rna folding data.
