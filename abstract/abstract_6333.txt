BACKGROUND
changes in dna methylation in the mammalian genome during development are frequent events and play major roles regulating gene expression and other developmental processes. it is necessary to identify these events so that we may understand how these changes affect normal development and how aberrant changes may impact disease.


RESULTS
in this study methylated dna immunoprecipitation  was used in conjunction with a nimblegen promoter plus cpg island  array to identify tissue and developmental stage specific differentially methylated dna regions  on a genome-wide basis. four tissues  from c57bl/6j mice were analyzed at three developmental stages . almost  <dig>  adult t-dmrs and  <dig>  ds-dmrs were identified. surprisingly, almost all ds-dmrs were tissue specific . in addition our results indicate that many ds-dmrs are methylated at early development stages  but are unmethylated in adult. there is a very strong bias for testis specific methylation in non-cpgi promoter regions . although the majority of t-dmrs and ds-dmrs tended to be in non-cpgi promoter regions, a relatively large number were also located in cpgi in promoter, intragenic and intergenic regions .


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggests the vast majority of unique sequence dna methylation has tissue specificity, that demethylation has a prominent role in tissue differentiation, and that dna methylation has regulatory roles in alternative promoter selection and in non-promoter regions. overall, our studies indicate changes in dna methylation during development are a dynamic, widespread, and tissue-specific process involving both dna methylation and demethylation.
