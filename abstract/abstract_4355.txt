BACKGROUND
most of the grapevine  cultivars grown today are those selected centuries ago, even though grapevine is one of the most important fruit crops in the world. grapevine has therefore not benefited from the advances in modern plant breeding nor more recently from those in molecular genetics and genomics: genes controlling important agronomic traits are practically unknown. a physical map is essential to positionally clone such genes and instrumental in a genome sequencing project.


RESULTS
we report on the first whole genome physical map of grapevine built using high information content fingerprinting of  <dig>  bac clones from the cultivar pinot noir. pinot noir, as most grape varieties, is highly heterozygous at the sequence level. this resulted in the two allelic haplotypes sometimes assembling into separate contigs that had to be accommodated in the map framework or in local expansions of contig maps. we performed computer simulations to assess the effects of increasing levels of sequence heterozygosity on bac fingerprint assembly and showed that the experimental assembly results are in full agreement with the theoretical expectations, given the heterozygosity levels reported for grape. the map is anchored to a dense linkage map consisting of  <dig> markers.  <dig> contigs are anchored to the genetic map, covering  <dig> of the  <dig> mb that make up the grape haploid genome.


CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a resource that makes it possible to access the grapevine genome, opening the way to a new era both in grape genetics and breeding and in wine making. the effects of heterozygosity on the assembly have been analyzed and characterized by using several complementary approaches which could be easily transferred to the study of other genomes which present the same features.
