BACKGROUND
the identification of quantitative trait loci  that are stable and consistent across multiple environments and populations plays an essential role in marker-assisted selection . in the present study, we used  <dig>  simple sequence repeat  markers, which included  <dig>  gossypium raimondii  sequence-based ssr markers to identify polymorphism between two upland cotton strains 0– <dig> and sgk <dig>  a total of  <dig> polymorphic primers were finally selected and used to genotype  <dig> recombinant inbred lines  derived from a cross between  <dig> and  <dig> and sgk <dig> and used to construct a linkage map. the ril population was evaluated for fiber quality traits in six locations in china for five years. stable qtls identified in this intraspecific cross could be used in future cotton breeding program and with fewer obstacles.


RESULTS
the map covered a distance of  <dig>  cm, which represents about  <dig>  % of the upland cotton genome, and with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. we identified  <dig> qtls for fiber quality traits, of which  <dig> qtls were determined to be stable across multiple environments. most of these qtls aggregated into clusters with two or more traits. a total of  <dig> qtl clusters were identified which consisted of  <dig> qtls. sixteen clusters in the at sub-genome comprised  <dig> qtls, whereas  <dig> clusters in the dt sub-genome that included  <dig> qtls for fiber quality were identified. four chromosomes, including chromosome  <dig> , c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> were rich in clusters harboring  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> clusters respectively. a meta-analysis was performed using biomercator v <dig>  to integrate qtls from  <dig> environmental datasets on the ril populations of the above mentioned parents and previous qtl reports. among the  <dig> identified qtls,  <dig> were identified as common qtls, whereas the remaining  <dig> qtls were determined to be novel qtls. the broad sense heritability estimates of fiber quality traits were high for fiber length , fiber strength , fiber micronaire , and fiber uniformity , but low for fiber elongation . meta-clusters on c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> were identified as stable qtl clusters and were considered more valuable in mas for the improvement of fiber quality of upland cotton.


CONCLUSIONS
multiple environmental evaluations of an intraspecific ril population were conducted to identify stable qtls. meta-qtl analyses identified a common chromosomal region that plays an important role in fiber development. therefore, qtls identified in the present study are an ideal candidate for mas in cotton breeding programs to improve fiber quality.
