BACKGROUND
damask roses  are mainly used for essential oil production. previous studies have indicated that all production material in bulgaria and turkey consists of only one genotype. nine polymorphic microsatellite markers were used to analyze the genetic diversity of  <dig> accessions of r. damascena collected across major and minor rose oil production areas in iran.


RESULTS
all microsatellite markers showed a high level of polymorphism . cluster analysis of genetic similarities revealed that these microsatellites identified a total of nine different genotypes. the genotype from isfahan province, which is the major production area, was by far the most common genotype . it was identical to the bulgarian genotype. other genotypes  were collected from minor production areas in several provinces, notably in the mountainous northwest of iran.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study that uncovered genetic diversity within damask rose. our results will guide new collection activities to establish larger collections and manage the iranian damask rose genetic resources. the genotypes identified here may be directly useful for breeding.
