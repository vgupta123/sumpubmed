BACKGROUND
though glioblastoma multiforme  is the most frequently occurring brain malignancy in adults, clinical treatment still faces challenges due to poor prognoses and tumor relapses. recently, micrornas  have been extensively used with the aim of developing accurate molecular therapies, because of their emerging role in the regulation of cancer-related genes. this work aims to identify the mirna signatures related to survival of gbm patients for developing molecular therapies.


RESULTS
this work proposes a support vector regression -based estimator, called svr-gbm, to estimate the survival time in patients with gbm using their mirna expression profiles. svr-gbm identified  <dig> out of  <dig> mirnas that were significantly associated with survival of gbm patients. svr-gbm had a mean absolute error of  <dig>  years and a correlation coefficient of  <dig>  between the real and predicted survival time. the  <dig> top-ranked mirnas according to prediction contribution are as follows: hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-526a, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig> and hsa-mir- <dig>  biological analysis using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway on the identified mirnas revealed their influence in gbm cancer.


CONCLUSIONS
the proposed svr-gbm using an optimal feature selection algorithm and an optimized svr to identify the  <dig> mirna signatures associated with survival of gbm patients. these mirna signatures are helpful to uncover the individual role of mirnas in gbm prognosis and develop mirna-based therapies.
