BACKGROUND
plants have developed a variety of mechanisms to counteract aphid attacks. they activate their defences by changing the expression of specific genes. previously we identified an activation tag mutant of arabidopsis thaliana on which myzus persicae population development was reduced. activation tag mutants are gain-of-function in which the expression of a gene is increased by the insertion of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s enhancer that acts on the natural promoter. by further characterizing this previously identified mutant we identified a gene that reduces performance of m. persicae and also provided clues about the mechanism involved.


RESULTS
we show that sku <dig> similar  <dig> , a gene whose expression in wild type plants is restricted to pollen and non-responsive to m. persicae attack, is overexpressed in the a. thaliana mutant showing reduced performance of m. persicae. monitoring m. persicae feeding behaviour on sks <dig> overexpressing plants indicated that m. persicae have difficulties feeding from the phloem. the constitutive expression of sks <dig> results in accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which is possibly regulated through the jasmonic acid pathway. the enhanced resistance is not aphid species specific as also the population development of brevicoryne brassicae was affected.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that constitutive expression in leaves of the pollen-specific gene sks <dig> can enhance plant defence, resulting in a reduction of m. persicae population development and also decreases the transmission of persistent viruses. overexpression of sks <dig> in a. thaliana also affects b. brassicae and possibly other phloem feeding insects as well. identifying genes that can enhance plant defence against insects will be important to open up new avenues for the development of insect resistant crop plants.
