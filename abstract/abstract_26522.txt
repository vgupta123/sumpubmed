BACKGROUND
anti-nmda-encephalitis is caused by antibodies against the n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor  and characterized by a severe encephalopathy with psychosis, epileptic seizures and autonomic disturbances. it predominantly occurs in young women and is associated in 59% with an ovarian teratoma.


RESULTS
we describe effects of cerebrospinal fluid  from an anti-n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor  encephalitis patient on in vitro neuronal network activity . in vitro nna of dissociated primary rat cortical populations was recorded by the microelectrode array  system.

the 23-year old patient was severely affected but showed an excellent recovery following multimodal immunomodulatory therapy and removal of an ovarian teratoma. patient csf  taken during the initial weeks after disease onset suppressed global spike- and burst rates of ivnna in contrast to pcsf sampled after clinical recovery and decrease of nmdar antibody titers. the synchrony of pcsf-affected ivnna remained unaltered during the course of the disease.


CONCLUSIONS
patient csf directly suppresses global activity of neuronal networks recorded by the mea system. in contrast, pcsf did not regulate the synchrony of ivnna suggesting that nmdar antibodies selectively regulate distinct parameters of ivnna while sparing their functional connectivity. thus, assessing ivnna could represent a new technique to evaluate functional consequences of autoimmune encephalitis-related csf changes.
