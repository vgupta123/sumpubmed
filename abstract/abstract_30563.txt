BACKGROUND
the  <dig> kda lipoprotein of mycobacterium tuberculosis  is an important target of the innate immune response. to investigate the effect of post-translation modification of this protein on innate recognition in the context of the whole bacillus, we derived a recombinant m. tuberculosis h37rv that lacked the  <dig> kda gene  and complemented this strain by reintroduction of the  <dig> kda gene into the chromosome as a single copy to produce Î”19:: <dig>  we also reintroduced the  <dig> kda gene in two modified forms that lacked motifs for acylation  and o-glycosylation .


RESULTS
both acylation and o-glycosylation were necessary for the protein to remain within the cell. il- <dig> beta secretion from human monocytes was significantly reduced by deletion of the  <dig> kda gene . complementation by the wild type, but not the mutagenised gene reversed this phenotype. the effect of deletion and complementation on il-12p <dig> and tnf secretion was less marked with no statistically significant differences between strains. although deletion of the  <dig> kda reduced apoptosis, an effect that could also only be reversed by complementation with the wild type gene, the results were variable between donors and did not achieve statistical significance.


CONCLUSIONS
these results confirm in the context of the whole bacillus an important role for post-translational modification of the  <dig> kda on both the cellular location and immune response to this protein.
