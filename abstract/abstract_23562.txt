BACKGROUND
correct aqueous pka values of unconjugated bilirubin , a poorly-soluble, unstable substance, are essential for understanding its functions. our prior solvent partition studies, of unlabeled and  ucb, indicated pka values above  <dig> . these high values were attributed to effects of internal h-bonding in ucb. many earlier and subsequent studies have reported lower pka values, some even below  <dig> , which are often used to describe the behavior of ucb. we here review  <dig> published studies that assessed aqueous pka values of ucb, critically evaluating their methodologies in relation to essential preconditions for valid pka measurements .


RESULTS
these re-assessments identified major deficiencies that invalidate the results of all but our partition studies. new theoretical modeling of ucb titrations shows remarkable, unexpected effects of self-association, yielding falsely low pka estimates, and provides some rationalization of the titration anomalies. the titration behavior reported for a soluble thioether conjugate of ucb at high aqueous concentrations is shown to be highly anomalous. theoretical re-interpretations of data in dmso and dimethylformamide show that those indirectly-derived aqueous pka values are unacceptable, and indicate new, high average pka values for ucb in non-aqueous media .


CONCLUSIONS
no reliable aqueous pka values of ucb are available for comparison with our partition-derived results. a companion paper shows that only the high pka values can explain the ph-dependence of ucb binding to phospholipids, cyclodextrins, and alkyl-glycoside and bile salt micelles.
