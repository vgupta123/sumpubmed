BACKGROUND
little is known about the potential of brachypodium distachyon as a model for low temperature stress responses in pooideae. the ice recrystallization inhibition protein  genes, fructosyltransferase  genes, and many c-repeat binding factor  genes are pooideae specific and important in low temperature responses. here we used comparative analyses to study conservation and evolution of these gene families in b. distachyon to better understand its potential as a model species for agriculturally important temperate grasses.


RESULTS
brachypodium distachyon contains cold responsive irip genes which have evolved through brachypodium specific gene family expansions. a large cold responsive cbf <dig> subfamily was identified in b. distachyon, while cbf <dig> homologs are absent from the genome. no b. distachyon fst gene homologs encode typical core pooideae fst-motifs and low temperature induced fructan accumulation was dramatically different in b. distachyon compared to core pooideae species.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that b. distachyon can serve as an interesting model for specific molecular mechanisms involved in low temperature responses in core pooideae species. however, the evolutionary history of key genes involved in low temperature responses has been different in brachypodium and core pooideae species. these differences limit the use of b. distachyon as a model for holistic studies relevant for agricultural core pooideae species.
