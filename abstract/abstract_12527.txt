BACKGROUND

rhodococcus equi  is an intracellular bacterium that affects young foals and immuno-compromised individuals causing severe pneumonia. currently, the genetic mechanisms that confer susceptibility and/or resistance to r. equi are not fully understood. previously, using a snp-based genome-wide association study, we identified a region on equine chromosome  <dig> associated with culture-confirmed clinical pneumonia. to better characterize this region and understand the function of the snp located within trpm <dig> that was associated with r. equi pneumonia, we performed rna-seq on  <dig> horses representing the  <dig> genotypic forms of this snp.


RESULTS
we identified differentially expressed genes in the innate immune response pathway when comparing homozygous a allele horses with the ab and bb horses. isoform analyses of the rna-seq data predicted the existence of multiple transcripts and provided evidence of differential expression at the trpm <dig> locus. this finding is consistent with previously demonstrated work in human cell lines in which isoform-specific expression of trpm <dig> was critical for cell viability.


CONCLUSIONS
this work demonstrates that snps in trpm <dig> are associated with differences in gene expression, suggesting that modulation of expression of this innate immune gene contributes to susceptibility to r. equi pneumonia.
