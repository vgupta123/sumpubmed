BACKGROUND
accurate bacterial genome annotations provide a framework to understanding cellular functions, behavior and pathogenicity and are essential for metabolic engineering. annotations based only on in silico predictions are inaccurate, particularly for large, high g + c content genomes due to the lack of similarities in gene length and gene organization to model organisms.


RESULTS
here we describe a 2d systems biology driven re-annotation of the saccharopolyspora erythraea genome using proteogenomics, a genome-scale metabolic reconstruction, rna-sequencing and small-rna-sequencing. we observed transcription of more than  <dig> intergenic regions, detected  <dig> peptides in intergenic regions, confirmed  <dig> open reading frames previously annotated as hypothetical proteins and reassigned function to open reading frames using the genome-scale metabolic reconstruction. finally, we present a novel way of mapping ribosomal binding sites across the genome by sequencing small rnas.


CONCLUSIONS
the work presented here describes a novel framework for annotation of the saccharopolyspora erythraea genome. based on experimental observations, the 2d annotation framework greatly reduces errors that are commonly made when annotating large-high g + c content genomes using computational prediction algorithms.
