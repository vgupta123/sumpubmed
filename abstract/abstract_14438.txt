BACKGROUND
neospora caninum and toxoplasma gondii are important pathogens of worldwide distribution. n. caninum is a major cause of abortion in cattle and dogs are main reservoirs because they excrete the environmentally resistant oocysts. toxoplasmosis is a worldwide zoonosis and dogs are considered as sentinels for this parasite because of their close contact with people and cats; additionally dog meat is also used for human consumption in china. the aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of n. caninum and t. gondii infection in dogs from china. a total of  <dig> countryside dog hearts in jilin, henan and anhui provinces of the people’s republic of china were collected from slaughter houses in two batches; the first batch of  <dig> in october  <dig>  and the second batch of  <dig> in april  <dig>  serum samples extracted from  <dig> dog hearts were tested for antibodies to n. caninum and from  <dig> dog hearts were tested for t. gondii antibodies in the modified agglutination tests , using respective antigens.


RESULTS
antibodies to n. caninum were  <dig> of  <dig>  of dogs with titers of 1: <dig> in  <dig>  1: <dig> in  <dig>  and 1: <dig> in  <dig>  all seropositive dogs were more than  <dig> year old. antibodies to t. gondii were found in  <dig> of  <dig>  dogs with titers of 1: <dig> in  <dig>  1: <dig> in 14; and 1: <dig> in  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study indicated low prevalence of n. caninum and t. gondii antibodies in dogs of china, compared with europe and america. identification of the risk factors that underlie these differences may help prevention of neosporosis and toxoplasmosis. this is the first report of n. caninum infection in dogs from china.
