BACKGROUND
while multiple replication origins have been observed in archaea, considerably less is known about their evolutionary processes. here, we performed a comparative analysis of the predicted  orc/cdc6-associated replication origins in  <dig> completely sequenced haloarchaeal genomes to investigate the diversity and evolution of replication origins in halophilic archaea.


RESULTS
multiple orc/cdc6-associated replication origins were predicted in all of the analyzed haloarchaeal genomes following the identification of putative orbs  that are associated with orc/cdc <dig> genes. five of these predicted replication origins in haloarcula hispanica were experimentally confirmed via autonomous replication activities. strikingly, several predicted replication origins in h. hispanica and haloarcula marismortui are located in the distinct regions of their highly homologous chromosomes, suggesting that these replication origins might have been introduced as parts of new genomic content. a comparison of the origin-associated orc/cdc <dig> homologs and the corresponding predicted orb elements revealed that the replication origins in a given haloarchaeon are quite diverse, while different haloarchaea can share a few conserved origins. phylogenetic and genomic context analyses suggested that there is an original replication origin  that was inherited from the ancestor of archaea, and several other origins were likely evolved and/or translocated within the haloarchaeal species.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides detailed information about the diversity of multiple orc/cdc6-associated replication origins in haloarchaeal genomes, and provides novel insight into the evolution of multiple replication origins in archaea.
