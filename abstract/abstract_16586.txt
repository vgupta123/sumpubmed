BACKGROUND
during development the switch from a depolarizing to a hyperpolarizing action of gaba is a consequence of a decrease of the na+-k+-2cl- co-transporter  and increase of the k+-cl- co-transporter  expression. however albino visual cortex neurons don't show a corresponding decrease in intracellular chloride concentration during development of the visual system as compared to pigmented animals.


RESULTS
our study revealed that more cells express nkcc <dig> in albinos compared to pigmented rat visual cortex neurons whereas kcc <dig> is expressed in all cells in both strains. we determined a positive relationship between the presence of nkcc <dig> and an inhibitory deficit in single neurons of the albino visual cortex. after pharmacological blockade of nkcc <dig> function with its specific inhibitor, bumetanide, the reversal potential of electrically evoked gabaa receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents and, as a consequence, i in albino visual cortex neurons shifted to the pigmented rat brain value. in conclusion, our pharmacological experiments and subsequent single cell real time pcr analysis of the co-transporter mrna demonstrated that the inhibitory deficit present in the albino visual cortical network is almost exclusively mediated by nkcc <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that blocking of nkcc <dig> in albino visual cortex neurons could improve processing in visual cortex and therefore might be beneficial for vision in albinos.
