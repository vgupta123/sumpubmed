BACKGROUND
probiotic bifidobacteria in combination with prebiotic carbohydrates have documented positive effects on human health regarding gastrointestinal disorders and improved immunity, however the selective routes of uptake remain unknown for most candidate prebiotics. the differential transcriptomes of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bl- <dig>  induced by  <dig> potential prebiotic oligosaccharides were analyzed to identify the genetic loci involved in the uptake and catabolism of α- and β-linked hexoses, and β-xylosides.


RESULTS
the overall transcriptome was modulated dependent on the type of glycoside  utilized. carbohydrate transporters of the major facilitator superfamily ) and atp-binding cassette  transporters  were differentially upregulated, together with glycoside hydrolases from families  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  sequence analysis of the identified solute-binding proteins that determine the specificity of abc transporters revealed similarities in the breadth and selectivity of prebiotic utilization by bifidobacteria.


CONCLUSIONS
this study identified the differential gene expression for utilization of potential prebiotics highlighting the extensive capabilities of bifidobacterium lactis bl- <dig> to utilize oligosaccharides. results provide insights into the ability of this probiotic microbe to utilize indigestible carbohydrates in the human gastrointestinal tract.
