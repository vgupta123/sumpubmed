BACKGROUND
micrornas  are an abundant class of small non-coding rnas  that reprogram gene expression by targeting mrna degradation and translational disruption. an emerging concept implicates mir coupling with transcription factors in myeloid cell development and function, thus contributing to host defense and inflammation. the important role that these molecules play in the pathogenesis of hiv- <dig> is only now emerging.


RESULTS
we provide evidence that exposure of monocyte-derived dendritic cells  to recombinant hiv- <dig> r <dig> gp <dig>  but not to ccr <dig> natural ligand ccl <dig>  influences the expression of a panel of mirs  regulated by stat <dig> and potentially targeting genes belonging to the stat <dig> signaling pathway. the blockage of gp120-induced stat <dig> activation impairs gp <dig> capacity to modulate the expression level of above mentioned mirs. predictive analysis of mir putative targets emphasizes that these mirs share common target genes. furthermore, gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis outline that these genes mainly belong to biological processes related to regulation of transcription, in a complex network of interactions involving pathways relevant to hiv-dc interaction.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, these results point to gp120-triggered modulation of mir expression via stat <dig> activation as a novel molecular mechanism exploited by hiv- <dig> to affect dc biology and thus modulate the immune response through complex regulatory loops involving, at the same time, mirs and transcription factors.
