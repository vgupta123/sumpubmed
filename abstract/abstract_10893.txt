BACKGROUND
glucosidation plays a major role in the inactivation and excretion of a great variety of both endogenous and exogenous compounds. a class of udp-glycosyltransferases  is involved in this process. insect ugts play important roles in several processes, including detoxication of substrates such as plant allelochemicals, cuticle formation, pigmentation, and olfaction. identification and characterization of bombyx mori ugt genes could provide valuable basic information for this important family and explain the detoxication mechanism and other processes in insects.


RESULTS
taking advantage of the newly assembled genome sequence, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the candidate ugt family in the silkworm, b. mori. based on ugt signature and their similarity to ugt homologs from other organisms, we identified  <dig> putative silkworm ugt genes. most of them are clustered on the silkworm chromosomes, with two major clusters on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the phylogenetic analysis of these identified  <dig> ugt protein sequences revealed five major groups. a comparison of the silkworm ugts with homologs from other sequenced insect genomes indicated that some ugts are silkworm-specific genes. the expression patterns of these candidate genes were investigated with known expressed sequence tags , microarray data, and rt-pcr method. in total,  <dig> genes were expressed in tissues examined and showed different patterns of expression profile, indicating that these ugt genes might have different functions.


CONCLUSIONS
b. mori possesses a largest insect ugt gene family characterized to date, including  <dig> genes. phylogenetic analysis, genomic organization and expression profiles provide an overview for the silkworm ugts and facilitate their functional studies in future.
