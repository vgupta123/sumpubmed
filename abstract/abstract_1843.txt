BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica is a facultative intracellular pathogen that replicates within a membrane-bound compartment termed salmonella containing vacuole . the biogenesis of scv requires salmonella type iii protein secretion/translocation system and their effector proteins which are translocated into host cells to exploit the vesicle trafficking pathways. ssef is one of these effectors required for scv formation and intracellular salmonella replication through unknown mechanisms.


RESULTS
in an attempt to identify host proteins that interact with ssef, we conduct a yeast two-hybrid screening of human cell cdna library using ssef as the bait. we identified that tip <dig>  an acetyltransferase, interacts with ssef. we showed that the tip <dig> acetylation activity was increased in the presence of ssef, and tip <dig> was upregulated upon salmonella infection. in addition, tip <dig> is required for efficient intracellular salmonella replication in macrophages.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data suggest that salmonella may use ssef to exploit the host tip <dig> acetyltransferase activity to promote efficient salmonella replication inside host cells.
