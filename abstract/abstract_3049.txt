BACKGROUND
three mutations in arabidopsis thaliana strain columbia – cpr <dig>  snc <dig>  and bal – map to the rpp <dig> locus, which contains a cluster of disease resistance genes. the similar phenotypes, gene expression patterns, and genetic interactions observed in these mutants are related to constitutive activation of pathogen defense signaling. however, these mutant alleles respond differently to various conditions. exposure to mutagens, such as ethyl methanesulfonate  and γ-irradiation, induce high frequency phenotypic instability of the bal allele. in addition, a fraction of the bal and cpr <dig> alleles segregated from bal × cpr <dig> f <dig> hybrids also show signs of phenotypic instability. to gain more insight into the mechanism of phenotypic instability of the bal and cpr <dig> mutations, we systematically compared the behavior of these unusual alleles with that of the missense gain-of-function snc <dig> allele in response to dna damage or passage through f <dig> hybrids.


RESULTS
we found that the cpr <dig> allele is similar to the bal allele in its unstable behavior after ems mutagenesis. for both the bal and cpr <dig> mutants, destabilization of phenotypes was observed in more than 10% of ems-treated plants in the m <dig> generation. in addition, exceptions to simple mendelian inheritance were identified in the m <dig> generation. like cpr <dig> × bal f <dig> hybrids, cpr <dig> × snc <dig> f <dig> hybrids and bal × snc <dig> f <dig> hybrids exhibited dwarf morphology. while only dwarf f <dig> plants were produced from bal × snc <dig> f <dig> hybrids, about 10% wild-type f <dig> progeny were produced from cpr <dig> × snc <dig> f <dig> hybrids, as well as from cpr <dig> × bal hybrids. segregation analysis suggested that the cpr <dig> allele in cpr <dig> × snc <dig> crosses was destabilized during the late f <dig> generation to early f <dig> generation.


CONCLUSIONS
with exposure to ems or different f <dig> hybrid contexts, phenotypic instability is induced for the bal and cpr <dig> alleles, but not for the snc <dig> allele. our results suggest that the rpp <dig> locus can adopt different metastable genetic or epigenetic states, the stability of which is highly susceptible to mutagenesis and pairing of different alleles.
