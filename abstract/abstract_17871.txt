BACKGROUND
systems biology approaches to study metabolic switching in streptomyces coelicolor a <dig> depend on cultivation conditions ensuring high reproducibility and distinct phases of culture growth and secondary metabolite production. in addition, biomass concentrations must be sufficiently high to allow for extensive time-series sampling before occurrence of a given nutrient depletion for transition triggering. the present study describes for the first time the development of a dedicated optimized submerged batch fermentation strategy as the basis for highly time-resolved systems biology studies of metabolic switching in s. coelicolor a <dig> 


RESULTS
by a step-wise approach, cultivation conditions and two fully defined cultivation media were developed and evaluated using strain m <dig> of s. coelicolor a <dig>  providing a high degree of cultivation reproducibility and enabling reliable studies of the effect of phosphate depletion and l-glutamate depletion on the metabolic transition to antibiotic production phase. interestingly, both of the two carbon sources provided, d-glucose and l-glutamate, were found to be necessary in order to maintain high growth rates and prevent secondary metabolite production before nutrient depletion. comparative analysis of batch cultivations with  both l-glutamate and d-glucose in excess,  l-glutamate depletion and d-glucose in excess,  l-glutamate as the sole source of carbon and  d-glucose as the sole source of carbon, reveal a complex interplay of the two carbon sources in the bacterium's central carbon metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study presents for the first time a dedicated cultivation strategy fulfilling the requirements for systems biology studies of metabolic switching in s. coelicolor a <dig>  key results from labelling and cultivation experiments on either or both of the two carbon sources provided indicate that in the presence of d-glucose, l-glutamate was the preferred carbon source, while d-glucose alone appeared incapable of maintaining culture growth, likely due to a metabolic bottleneck at the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-coa.
