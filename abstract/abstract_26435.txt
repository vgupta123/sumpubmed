BACKGROUND
tip <dig> plays important roles in tumor immunobiology, pre-mrna splicing, expression regulation of viral and host genes, and possibly protein turnover. it is clear that our understanding of tip <dig> biological function remains incomplete.


RESULTS
herein, we employed an immunoaffinity-based enrichment approach combined with protein mass spectrometry and attempted to identify tip110-interacting cellular proteins. a total of  <dig> major proteins were identified to be complexed with tip <dig>  among them was y-box binding protein  <dig> . the interaction of tip <dig> with yb- <dig> was further dissected and confirmed to be specific and involve the n-terminal of both tip <dig> and yb- <dig> proteins. a hiv- <dig> ltr promoter-driven reporter gene assay and a cd <dig> minigene in vivo splicing assay were chosen to evaluate the functional relevance of the tip110/yb- <dig> interaction. we showed that yb- <dig> potentiates the tip110/tat-mediated transactivation of the hiv- <dig> ltr promoter while tip <dig> promotes the inclusion of the exon  <dig> in cd <dig> minigene alternative splicing.


CONCLUSIONS
tip <dig> and yb- <dig> interact to form a complex and mutually regulate each otherâ€™s biological functions.
