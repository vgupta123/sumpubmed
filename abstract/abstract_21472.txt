BACKGROUND
yersinia enterocolitica outer membrane protein a  is one of the major outer membrane proteins with high immunogenicity. we performed the polymorphism analysis for the outer membrane protein a and putative outer membrane protein a  family protein gene of  <dig> y. enterocolitica strains.


RESULTS
the data showed all the pathogenic strains and biotype 1a strains harboring ystb gene carried both ompa and p-ompa genes; parts of the biotype 1a strains not harboring ystb gene carried either ompa or p-ompa gene. in non-pathogenic strains , distribution of the two genes and ystb were highly correlated, showing genetic polymorphism. the pathogenic and non-pathogenic, highly and weakly pathogenic strains were divided into different groups based on sequence analysis of two genes. although the variations of the sequences, the translated proteins and predicted secondary or tertiary structures of ompa and p-ompa were similar.


CONCLUSIONS
ompa and p-ompa gene were highly conserved for pathogenic y. enterocolitica. the distributions of two genes were correlated with ystb for biotype 1a strains. the polymorphism analysis results of the two genes probably due to different bio-serotypes of the strains, and reflected the dissemination of different bio-serotype clones of y. enterocolitica.
