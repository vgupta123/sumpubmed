BACKGROUND
in plants and animals, a large number of double-stranded rna binding proteins  have been shown to act as non-catalytic cofactors of dicers and to participate in the biogenesis of small rnas involved in rna silencing. we have previously shown that the loss of arabidopsis thaliana’s drb <dig> protein results in a significant increase in the population of rna polymerase iv  dependent sirnas, which are involved in the rna-directed dna methylation  process.


RESULTS
surprisingly, despite this observation, we show in this work that drb <dig> is part of a high molecular weight complex that does not involve rddm actors but several chromatin regulator proteins, such as msi <dig>  prmt4b and hda <dig>  we show that drb <dig> can bind transposable element  transcripts in vivo but that drb <dig> mutants do not have a significant variation in te dna methylation.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that drb <dig> is part of a repressive epigenetic regulator complex involved in a negative feedback loop, adjusting epigenetic state to transcription level at te loci, in parallel of the rddm pathway. loss of drb <dig> would mainly result in an increased production of te transcripts, readily converted in p4-sirnas by the rddm machinery.
