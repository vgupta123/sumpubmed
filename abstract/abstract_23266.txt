BACKGROUND
the persistence in adult teleost fish of retinal stem cells that exhibit all of the features of true 'adult stem cells' – self-renewal, multipotency, and the capacity to respond to injury by mitotic activation with the ability to regenerate differentiated tissues – has been known for several decades. however, the specialized cellular and molecular characteristics of these adult retinal stem cells and the microenvironmental niches that support their maintenance in the differentiated retina and regulate their activity during growth and regeneration have not yet been elucidated.


RESULTS
our data show that the zebrafish retina has two kinds of specialized niches that sustain retinal stem cells: 1) a neuroepithelial germinal zone at the interface between neural retina and ciliary epithelium, called the ciliary marginal zone , a continuous annulus around the retinal circumference, and 2) the microenvironment around some müller glia in the differentiated retina. in the uninjured retina, scattered müller glia  are associated with clusters of proliferating retinal progenitors that are restricted to the rod photoreceptor lineage, but following injury, the müller-associated retinal progenitors can function as multipotent retinal stem cells to regenerate other types of retinal neurons. the cmz has several features in common with the neurogenic niches in the adult mammalian brain, including access to the apical epithelial surface and a close association with blood vessels. müller glia in the teleost retina have a complex response to local injury that includes some features of reactive gliosis  together with dedifferentiation and re-acquisition of phenotypic and molecular characteristics of multipotent retinal progenitors in the cmz  along with characteristics associated with radial glia . we also describe a novel specific marker for müller glia, apoe.


CONCLUSIONS
the stem cell niches that support multi-lineage retinal progenitors in the intact, growing and regenerating teleost retina have properties characteristic of neuroepithelia and neurogenic radial glia. the regenerative capacity of the adult zebrafish retina with its ability to replace lost retinal neurons provides an opportunity to discover the molecular regulators that lead to functional repair of damaged neural tissue.
