BACKGROUND
the superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors  is involved in numerous fundamental biological processes as inflammation, blood coagulation and apoptosis. our interest is focused on the serpina <dig> sub-family. the major human plasma protease inhibitor, Î±1-antichymotrypsin, encoded by the serpina <dig> gene, is homologous to genes organized in clusters in several mammalian species. however, although there is a similar genic organization with a high degree of sequence conservation, the reactive-centre-loop domains, which are responsible for the protease specificity, show significant divergences.


RESULTS
we provide additional information by analyzing the situation of serpina <dig> in the bovine genome. a cluster of eight genes and one pseudogene sharing a high degree of identity and the same structural organization was characterized. bovine serpina <dig> genes were localized by radiation hybrid mapping on 21q <dig> and only spanned over  <dig> kilobases. for all these genes, we propose a new nomenclature from serpina3- <dig> to serpina3- <dig>  they share approximately 70% of identity with the human serpina <dig> homologue. in the cluster, we described an original sub-group of six members with an unexpected high degree of conservation for the reactive-centre-loop domain, suggesting a similar peptidase inhibitory pattern. preliminary expression analyses of these bovserpina3s showed different tissue-specific patterns and diverse states of glycosylation and phosphorylation. finally, in the context of phylogenetic analyses, we improved our knowledge on mammalian serpinas evolution.


CONCLUSIONS
our experimental results update data of the bovine genome sequencing, substantially increase the bovserpina <dig> sub-family and enrich the phylogenetic tree of serpins. we provide new opportunities for future investigations to approach the biological functions of this unusual subset of serine proteinase inhibitors.
