BACKGROUND
local adaptation to divergent environmental conditions can promote population genetic differentiation even in the absence of geographic barriers and hence, lead to speciation. perturbations by catastrophic events, however, can distort such parapatric ecological speciation processes. here, we asked whether an exceptionally strong flood led to homogenization of gene pools among locally adapted populations of the atlantic molly  in the cueva del azufre system in southern mexico, where two strong environmental selection factors  drive the diversification of p. mexicana. nine nuclear microsatellites as well as heritable female life history traits  were used as markers to compare genetic differentiation, genetic diversity, and especially population mixing  before and after the flood.


RESULTS
habitat type , but not geographic distance was the major predictor of genetic differentiation. before and after the flood, each habitat type harbored a genetically distinct population. only a weak signal of individual dislocation among ecologically divergent habitat types was uncovered . by contrast, several lines of evidence are indicative of increased flood-induced dislocation within the same habitat type, e.g., between different cave chambers of the cueva del azufre.


CONCLUSIONS
the virtual absence of individual dislocation among ecologically different habitat types indicates strong natural selection against migrants. thus, our current study exemplifies that ecological speciation in this and other systems, in which extreme environmental factors drive speciation, may be little affected by temporary perturbations, as adaptations to physico-chemical stressors may directly affect the survival probability in divergent habitat types.
