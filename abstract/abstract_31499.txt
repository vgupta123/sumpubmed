BACKGROUND
polarised gene expression is thought to lead to the graded distribution of signaling molecules providing a patterning mechanism across the embryonic eye. bone morphogenetic protein  <dig>  is expressed in the dorsal optic vesicle as it transforms into the optic cup. bmp <dig> deletions in human and mouse result in failure of eye development, but little attempt has been made to investigate mammalian targets of bmp <dig> signaling. in chick, retroviral gene overexpression studies indicate that bmp <dig> activates the dorsally expressed tbx <dig> gene, which represses ventrally expressed cvax. it is not known whether the tbx <dig> related genes, tbx <dig> and tbx <dig>  are bmp <dig> targets in the mammalian retina and whether bmp <dig> acts at a distance from its site of expression. although it is established that drosophila dpp  acts as a morphogen, there is little evidence that bmp <dig> gradients are interpreted to create domains of bmp <dig> target gene expression in the mouse.


RESULTS
our data show that the level of bmp <dig> signaling is critical for the regulation of distinct tbx <dig>  tbx <dig>  tbx <dig> and vax <dig> gene expression domains along the dorso-ventral axis of the mouse optic cup. bmp <dig> signaling gradients were manipulated in whole mouse embryo cultures during optic cup development, by implantation of beads soaked in bmp <dig>  or the bmp antagonist noggin, to provide a local signaling source. tbx <dig>  tbx <dig> and tbx <dig>  showed a differential response to alterations in the level of bmp <dig> along the entire dorso-ventral axis of the optic cup, suggesting that bmp <dig> acts across a distance. increased levels of bmp <dig> caused expansion of tbx <dig> and tbx <dig>  but not tbx <dig>  into the ventral retina and repression of the ventral marker vax <dig>  conversely, noggin abolished tbx <dig> expression but only shifted tbx <dig> expression dorsally. increased levels of bmp <dig> signaling caused decreased proliferation, reduced retinal volume and altered the shape of the optic cup.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest the existence of a dorsal-high, ventral-low bmp <dig> signaling gradient across which distinct domains of tbx <dig>  tbx <dig>  tbx <dig> and vax <dig> transcription factor gene expression are set up. furthermore we show that the correct level of bmp <dig> signaling is critical for normal growth of the mammalian embryonic eye.
