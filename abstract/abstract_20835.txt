BACKGROUND
α-synuclein is a parkinson's-disease-related protein. it forms aggregates in vivo, and these aggregates cause cell cytotoxicity. aggregation inhibitors are expected to reduce α-synuclein cytotoxicity, and an aggregation accelerator has recently been reported to reduce α-synuclein cytotoxicity. therefore, amyloid aggregation modulating ligands are expected to serve as therapeutic medicines.


RESULTS
we screened peptide ligands against α-synuclein by in silico panning, a method which we have proposed previously. in this study, we selected as the target a very hydrophobic region known as the amyloid-core-forming region. since this region cannot be dissolved in water, it is difficult to carry out the in vitro screening of its peptide ligand. we carried out  <dig> rounds of in silico panning using a genetic algorithm and a docking simulation. after the in silico panning, we evaluated the top peptides screened in silico by in vitro assay. these peptides were capable of binding to α-synuclein.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that it is possible to screen α-synuclein-binding peptides by in silico panning. the screened peptides bind to α-synuclein, thus affecting the aggregation of α-synuclein.
