BACKGROUND
next-generation sequencing technologies have been applied most often to model organisms or species closely related to a model. however, these methods have the potential to be valuable in many wild organisms, including those of conservation concern. we used roche  <dig> pyrosequencing to characterize gene expression in polyploid lake sturgeon  gonads.


RESULTS
titration runs on a roche  <dig> gs-flx produced more than  <dig>  sequencing reads. these reads represented  <dig>  unique sequences that passed quality control . these were assembled into  <dig>  contigs . over  <dig>  sequencing reads  were assigned gene ontologies, mostly to protein, rna, and ion binding. a total of  <dig> candidate snps were identified from >  <dig> different genes. we employed an analytical approach from theoretical ecology  to evaluate depth of sequencing coverage relative to gene discovery. we also considered the relative merits of normalized versus native cdna libraries when using next-generation sequencing platforms. not surprisingly, fewer genes from the normalized libraries were rrna subunits. rarefaction suggests that normalization has little influence on the efficiency of gene discovery, at least when working with thousands of reads from a single tissue type.


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that titration runs on  <dig> sequencers can characterize thousands of expressed sequence tags which can be used to identify snps, gene ontologies, and levels of gene expression in species of conservation concern. we anticipate that rarefaction will be useful in evaluations of gene discovery and that next-generation sequencing technologies hold great potential for the study of other non-model organisms.
