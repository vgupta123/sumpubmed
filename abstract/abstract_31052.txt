BACKGROUND
thymic involution is a prominent characteristic of an aging immune system. when thymic function is reduced/absent, the peripheral t cell pool is subject to the laws of peripheral t cell homeostasis that favor survival/expansion of t cell receptors with relatively higher functional avidity for self-peptide/mhc complexes. due to difficulties in assessing the tcr avidity in polyclonal population of t cells, it is currently not known whether high avidity t cells preferentially survive in aging individuals, and what impact this might have on the function of the immune system and development of autoimmune diseases.


RESULTS
the phenotype of t cells from aged mice  indicating functional tcr avidity  correlates with the level of preserved thymic function. in mice with moderate thymic output , t cells displayed cd3lowcd5hi phenotype characteristic for high functional avidity. in old mice with drastically low numbers of cd62lhi t cells reduced cd <dig> levels were found. after adult thymectomy, t cells of young mice developed cd3lowcd5hi phenotype, followed by a cd3lowcd5low phenotype. spleens of old mice with the cd3low/cd5hi t cell phenotype displayed increased levels of il- <dig> mrna, and their t cells could be induced to secrete il- <dig> in vitro. in contrast, downmodulation of cd <dig> was accompanied with reduced il- <dig> expression and impaired anti-cd <dig> induced proliferation. irrespective of the cd3/cd <dig> phenotype, reduced severity of experimental allergic myelitis occurred in old mice. in mtb tcrÎ² transgenic mice that display globally elevated tcr avidity for self peptide/mhc, identical change patterns occurred, only at an accelerated pace.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that age-associated dysfunctions of the immune system could in part be due to functional erosion of t cells devised to protect the hosts from the prolonged exposure to t cells with high-avidity for self.
