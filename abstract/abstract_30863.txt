BACKGROUND
micrornas play important roles in regulating biological processes, including organ morphogenesis and maturation. however, little is known about specific pathways regulated by mirna during lung development. between the canalicular and saccular stages of the developing lung several important cellular events occur, including the onset of surfactant synthesis, microvascular remodeling and structural preparation for subsequent alveolarization. the mirnas that are actively regulated, and the identity of their targets during this important developmental interval in the lung remain elusive.


RESULTS
using tlda low density real-time pcr arrays, the expression of  <dig> mirnas in male and female fetal mouse lungs of gestational days e <dig> â€“ e <dig> were profiled. statistical analyses identified  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas that changed significantly between sexes and with gestation, respectively. in silico analysis using ingenuity pathway analysis  identified specific pathways and networks known to be targets of these mirnas which are important to lung development. pathways that are targeted by sex regulated mirnas include retinoin, igfr <dig>  tp <dig> and akt. pathways targeted by gestation-regulated mirnas include vegfa and mediators of glucose metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
mirnas are differentially regulated across time and between sexes during the canalicular and saccular stages of lung development. sex-associated differential mirna expression may regulate the differences in structural and functional male and female lung development, as shown by networks generated using in silico analysis. these data provide a valuable resource to further enhance the understanding of mirna control of lung development and maturation.
