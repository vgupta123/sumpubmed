BACKGROUND
hect domain and ankyrin repeat containing e <dig> ubiquitin protein ligase  <dig>  regulates a wide variety of cellular processes. it has been shown that one of the targets of hace <dig> is the gtp-bound form of the small gtpase rac <dig>  however, the role of hace <dig> in early development remains unknown.


RESULTS
in situ hybridization revealed that xenopus laevis hace <dig> is specifically expressed in the ectoderm at the blastula and gastrula stages and in the epidermis, branchial arch, kidney, and central nervous system at the tailbud stage. knockdown of hace <dig> in xenopus laevis embryos via antisense morpholino oligonucleotides led to defects in body axis elongation, pigment formation, and eye formation at the tadpole stage. experiments with keller sandwich explants showed that hace <dig> knockdown inhibited convergent extension, a morphogenetic movement known to be crucial for body axis elongation. in addition, time lapse imaging of whole embryos during the neurula stage indicated that hace <dig> knockdown also delayed neural tube closure. the defects caused by hace <dig> knockdown were partly rescued by knockdown of rac <dig>  moreover, embryos expressing a constitutively active form of rac <dig> displayed phenotypes similar to those of embryos with hace <dig> knocked down.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that xenopus laevis hace <dig> plays an important role in early embryonic development, possibly via regulation of rac <dig> activity.
