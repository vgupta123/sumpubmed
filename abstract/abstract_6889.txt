BACKGROUND
lung cancer, especially non-small cell lung cancer, is a leading cause of malignant tumor death worldwide. understanding the mechanisms employed by the main regulators, such as micrornas  and transcription factors , still remains elusive. the patterns of their cooperation and biological functions in the synergistic regulatory network have rarely been studied.


RESULTS
here, we describe the first mirna-tf synergistic regulation network in human lung cancer. we identified important regulators  and significant mirna-tf synergistic regulatory motifs by random simulations. the two most significant motifs were the co-regulation of mirnas and tfs, and tf-mediated cascade regulation. we also developed an algorithm to uncover the biological functions of the human lung cancer mirna-tf synergistic regulatory network , and the specific functions of each mirna-tf synergistic subnetwork. we found that the mir- <dig> family exerted important effects in the regulation of non-small cell lung cancer, such as in proliferation and cell cycle regulation by targeting the retinoblastoma protein  and forming a feed forward loop with the e2f <dig> tf. we proposed a model for the mir- <dig> family, e2f <dig>  and rb <dig> to demonstrate their potential roles in the occurrence and development of non-small cell lung cancer.


CONCLUSIONS
this work will provide a framework for constructing mirna-tf synergistic regulatory networks, function analysis in diseases, and identification of the main regulators and regulatory motifs, which will be useful for understanding the putative regulatory motifs involving mirnas and tfs, and for predicting new targets for cancer studies.
