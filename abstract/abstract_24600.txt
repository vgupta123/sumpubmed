BACKGROUND
in plants, sucrose synthase  is widely considered as a key enzyme involved in sucrose metabolism. several paralogous genes encoding different isozymes of sus have been identified and characterized in multiple plant genomes, while limited information of sus genes is available to date for cotton.


RESULTS
here, we report the molecular cloning, structural organization, phylogenetic evolution and expression profiles of seven sus genes  identified from diploid fiber cotton . comparisons between cdna and genomic sequences revealed that the cotton gasus genes were interrupted by multiple introns. comparative screening of introns in homologous genes demonstrated that the number and position of sus introns are highly conserved among sus genes in cotton and other more distantly related plant species. phylogenetic analysis showed that gasus <dig>  gasus <dig>  gasus <dig>  gasus <dig> and gasus <dig> could be clustered together into a dicot sus group, while gasus <dig> and gasus <dig> were separated evenly into other two groups, with members from both dicot and monocot species. expression profiles analyses of the seven sus genes indicated that except gasus <dig>  of which the transcripts was undetectable in all tissues examined, and gasus <dig>  which was only expressed in stem and petal, the other five paralogues were differentially expressed in a wide ranges of tissues, and showed development-dependent expression profiles in cotton fiber cells.


CONCLUSIONS
this is a comprehensive study of the sus gene family in cotton plant. the results presented in this work provide new insights into the evolutionary conservation and sub-functional divergence of the cotton sus gene family in response to cotton fiber growth and development.
