BACKGROUND
hickory , a woody plant with high nutritional and economic value, is widely planted in china. due to its long juvenile phase, grafting is a useful technique for large-scale cultivation of hickory. to reveal the molecular mechanism during the graft process, we sequenced the transcriptomes of graft union in hickory.


RESULTS
in our study, six rna-seq libraries yielded a total of  <dig> , <dig> clean short reads comprising  <dig>  gb of sequence data. a large number of differentially expressed genes  at three time points during the graft process were identified. in detail,  <dig> degs in the  <dig> d vs  <dig> d  comparison were classified into  <dig> enriched gene ontology  categories, and  <dig> degs in the  <dig> d vs  <dig> d comparison were classified into  <dig> enriched go categories. furthermore, an overview of the ppi network was constructed by these degs. in addition,  <dig> genes related to the auxin-and cytokinin-signaling pathways were identified, and some were validated by qrt-pcr analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
our comprehensive analysis provides basic information on the candidate genes and hormone signaling pathways involved in the graft process in hickory and other woody plants.
