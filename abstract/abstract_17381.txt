BACKGROUND
protease activated receptors  consist of a family of four g protein-coupled receptors. many types of cells express several pars, whose physiological significance is mostly unknown.


RESULTS
here, we show that non-invasive resonant waveguide grating  biosensor differentiates signaling of endogenous protease activated receptor subtype  <dig>  and  <dig>  in human epidermoid carcinoma a <dig> cells. the biosensor directly measures dynamic mass redistribution  resulted from ligand-induced receptor activation in adherent cells. in a <dig>  both par <dig> and par <dig> agonists, but neither par <dig> nor par <dig> agonists, trigger dose-dependent ca2+ mobilization as well as gq-type dmr signals. both ca2+ flux and dmr signals display comparable desensitization patterns upon repeated stimulation with different combinations of agonists. however, par <dig> and par <dig> exhibit distinct kinetics of receptor re-sensitization. furthermore, both trypsin- and thrombin-induced ca2+ flux signals show almost identical dependence on cell surface cholesterol level, but their corresponding dmr signals present different sensitivities.


CONCLUSIONS
optical biosensor provides an alternative readout for examining receptor activation under physiologically relevant conditions, and differentiates the signaling of endogenous par <dig> and par <dig> in a <dig>
