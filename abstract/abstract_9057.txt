BACKGROUND
a variety of neurological disorders, including alzheimer’s disease, parkinson’s disease, major depressive disorder, dyslexia and autism, are differentially prevalent between females and males. to better understand the possible molecular basis for the sex-biased nature of neurological disorders, we used a developmental series of female and male mice at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> months of age to assess both mrna and protein in the hippocampus with rna-sequencing and mass-spectrometry, respectively.


RESULTS
the transcriptomic analysis identifies  <dig> genes that are differentially expressed between animals of different ages. the bulk of these differentially expressed genes are changed in both sexes at one or more ages, but a total of  <dig> transcripts are differentially expressed between females and males at one or more ages. the number of transcripts that are differentially expressed between females and males is greater in adult animals than in younger animals. additionally, we identify  <dig> transcripts that show complex and sex-specific patterns of temporal regulation through postnatal development,  <dig> of which are heat-shock proteins. we also find a modest correlation between levels of mrna and protein in the mouse hippocampus .


CONCLUSIONS
this study adds to the substantial body of evidence for transcriptomic regulation in the hippocampus during postnatal development. additionally, this analysis reveals sex differences in the transcriptome of the developing mouse hippocampus, and further clarifies the need to include both female and male mice in longitudinal studies involving molecular changes in the hippocampus.
