BACKGROUND
pluripotency is a fundamental property of early mammalian development but it is currently unclear to what extent its cellular mechanisms are conserved in vertebrates or metazoans. pou5f <dig> and pou <dig> are the two principle members constituting the class v pou domain family of transcription factors, thought to have a conserved role in the regulation of pluripotency in vertebrates as well as germ cell maintenance and neural patterning. they have undergone a complex pattern of evolution which is poorly understood and controversial.


RESULTS
by analyzing the sequences of pou5f <dig>  pou <dig> and their flanking genes, we provide strong indirect evidence that pou5f <dig> originated at least as early as a common ancestor of gnathostomes but became extinct in a common ancestor of teleost fishes, while both pou5f <dig> and pou <dig> survived in the sarcopterygian lineage leading to tetrapods. less divergent forms of pou5f <dig> and pou <dig> appear to have persisted among cartilaginous fishes.


CONCLUSIONS
our study resolves the controversial evolutionary relationship between teleost pou <dig> and tetrapod pou <dig> and pou5f <dig>  and shows that class v pou transcription factors have existed at least since the common ancestor of gnathostome vertebrates. it provides a framework for elucidating the basis for the lineage-specific extinctions of pou <dig> and pou5f <dig>
