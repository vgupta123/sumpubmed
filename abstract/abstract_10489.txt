BACKGROUND
in this study we explored preeclampsia through a bioinformatics approach. we create a comprehensive genes/proteins dataset by the analysis of both public proteomic data and text mining of public scientific literature. from this dataset the associated protein-protein interaction network has been obtained. several indexes of centrality have been explored for hubs detection as well as the enrichment statistical analysis of metabolic pathway and disease.


RESULTS
we confirmed the well known relationship between preeclampsia and cardiovascular diseases but also identified statistically significant relationships with respect to cancer and aging. moreover, significant metabolic pathways such as apoptosis, cancer and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction have also been identified by enrichment analysis. we obtained flt <dig>  vegfa, fn <dig>  f <dig> and pgf genes with the highest scores by hubs analysis; however, we also found other genes as pdia <dig>  lyn, sh2b <dig> and ndrg <dig> with high scores.


CONCLUSIONS
the applied methodology not only led to the identification of well known genes related to preeclampsia but also to propose new candidates poorly explored or completely unknown in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, which eventually need to be validated experimentally. moreover, new possible connections were detected between preeclampsia and other diseases that could open new areas of research. more must be done in this area to resolve the identification of unknown interactions of proteins/genes and also for a better integration of metabolic pathways and diseases.
