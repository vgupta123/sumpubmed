BACKGROUND
cytometric measurements of dna content and chromatin-bound mcm <dig> have demonstrated bimodal patterns of expression in g <dig>  these patterns, the replication licensing function of mcm proteins, and a correlation between mcm loading and cell cycle commitment for cells re-entering the cell cycle, led us to test the idea that cells expressing a defined high level of chromatin-bound mcm <dig> in g <dig> are committed - i.e., past the g <dig> restriction point. we developed a cell-based assay for tightly-bound pcna  and mcm <dig> , dna content, and a mitotic marker to clearly define g <dig>  s, g <dig>  and m phases of the cell cycle. htert-bj <dig>  htert-rpe- <dig>  and molt <dig> cells were extracted with triton x- <dig> followed by methanol fixation, stained with antibodies and dapi, then measured by cytometry.


RESULTS
bivariate analysis of cytometric data demonstrated complex patterns with distinct clustering for all combinations of the  <dig> variables. in g <dig>  cells clustered in two groups characterized by low and high mcm6* expression. serum starvation and release experiments showed that residence in the high group was in late g <dig>  just prior to s phase. kinetic experiments, employing serum withdrawal, and stathmokinetic analysis with aphidicolin, mimosine or nocodazole demonstrated that cells with high levels of mcm6* cycled with the committed phases of the cell cycle .


CONCLUSIONS
a multivariate assay for mcm6*, pcna*, dna content, and a mitotic marker provides analysis capable of estimating the fraction of pre and post-restriction point g <dig> cells and supports the idea that there are at least two states in g <dig> defined by levels of chromatin bound mcm proteins.
