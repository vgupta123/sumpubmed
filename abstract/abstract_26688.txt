BACKGROUND
bovine brucellosis is an important disease affecting cattle characterised by abortion, still birth, reduced milk production, weak foetus and infertility in both males and females. there is wide distribution of the disease among cattle and several wildlife species. bovine brucellosis is commonly caused by b. abortus and very occasionally b. melitensis and b. suis. the distribution of bovine brucellosis in cattle has not been described in malaysia. in this paper we describe the distribution, pattern and trend of bovine brucellosis in peninsular malaysia between  <dig> and  <dig> based on serological data obtained from nationwide b. abortus serosurveillance activities in cattle populations.


RESULTS
brucella antibodies were detected in  <dig> % of sampled herds  and  <dig> %  of sampled cattle. the state of pahang had the highest animal and herd-level seroprevalence of  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. the herd-level seroprevalence varied but remained high  over the period of study and generally increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  seropositive herds clustered around the central part of the peninsula within the period of the study. the months of september, october and november illustrated the highest rates with corresponding seroprevalences of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. a noticeable variation was observed in the cattle-level seroprevalence, but the rate remained relatively low . the chi-square statistics showed herd size , breed , month of sampling , year  and state  to be associated with increased seropositivity.


CONCLUSIONS
bovine brucellosis is widespread among herds in peninsular malaysia at a low within-herd seroprevalence rate.
