BACKGROUND
the gene ontology  facilitates the description of the action of gene products in a biological context. many go terms refer to chemical entities that participate in biological processes. to facilitate accurate and consistent systems-wide biological representation, it is necessary to integrate the chemical view of these entities with the biological view of go functions and processes. we describe a collaborative effort between the go and the chemical entities of biological interest  ontology developers to ensure that the representation of chemicals in the go is both internally consistent and in alignment with the chemical expertise captured in chebi.


RESULTS
we have examined and integrated the chebi structural hierarchy into the go resource through computationally-assisted manual curation of both go and chebi. our work has resulted in the creation of computable definitions of go terms that contain fully defined semantic relationships to corresponding chemical terms in chebi.


CONCLUSIONS
the set of logical definitions using both the go and chebi has already been used to automate aspects of go development and has the potential to allow the integration of data across the domains of biology and chemistry. these logical definitions are available as an extended version of the ontology from http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go/extensions/go-plus.owl.
