BACKGROUND
the human neural stem cell line ctx0e <dig> was developed for the cell based treatment of chronic stroke disability. derived from fetal cortical brain tissue, ctx0e <dig> is a clonal cell line that contains a single copy of the c-mycertam transgene delivered by retroviral infection. under the conditional regulation by 4-hydroxytamoxifen , c-mycertam enabled large-scale stable banking of the ctx0e <dig> cells. in this study, we investigated the fate of this transgene following growth arrest  in vitro and following intracerebral implantation into a mid-cerebral artery occluded  rat brain. in vitro, 4-weeks after removing growth factors and 4-oht from the culture medium, c-mycertam transgene transcription is reduced by ~75%. furthermore, immunocytochemistry and western blotting demonstrated a concurrent decrease in the c-mycertam protein. to examine the transcription of the transgene in vivo, ctx0e <dig> cells  were implanted 4-weeks post mcao lesion and analysed for human cell survival and c-mycertam transcription by qpcr and qrt-pcr, respectively.


RESULTS
the results show that ctx0e <dig> cells were present in all grafted animal brains ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the total cells injected. prior to implantation, the ctx0e <dig> cell suspension contained  <dig>   copies of the c-mycertam transcript per cell. after implantation the c-mycertam transcript copy number per ctx0e <dig> cell had reduced to  <dig>   at 1-week and  <dig>   at 4-weeks. bisulfite genomic dna sequencing of the in vivo samples confirmed c-mycertam silencing occurred through methylation of the transgene promoter sequence.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion the results confirm that ctx0e <dig> cells downregulated c-mycertam transgene expression both in vitro following egf, bfgf and 4-oht withdrawal and in vivo following implantation in mcao rat brain. the silencing of the c-mycertam transgene in vivo provides an additional safety feature of ctx0e <dig> cells for potential clinical application.
