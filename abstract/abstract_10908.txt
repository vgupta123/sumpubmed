BACKGROUND
the importance of diarrhoeagenic escherichia coli  infections in the arabian gulf including kuwait is not known. the prevalence of dec  was studied in  <dig> children ≤  <dig> years old hospitalised with acute diarrhoea and  <dig> matched controls from two hospitals during 2005– <dig> by pcr assays using e. coli colony pools.


RESULTS
the prevalence of dec varied from  <dig> % for ehec to  <dig> % for epec  in diarrhoeal children with no significant differences compared to that in control children . twenty-seven epec isolates studied mostly belonged to non-traditional serotypes and possessed β and θ intimin subtypes. a total of  <dig> dec isolates from diarrhoeal children and  <dig> from controls studied for antimicrobial susceptibility showed resistance for older antimicrobials, ampicillin , tetracycline  and trimethoprim ;  <dig> % of the isolates were multidrug-resistant . six  dec isolates produced extended spectrum β-lactamases and possessed genetic elements  associated with them.


CONCLUSIONS
we speculate that the lack of significant association of dec with diarrhoea in children in kuwait compared to countries surrounding the arabian gulf region may be attributable to high environmental and food hygiene due to high disposable income in kuwait.
