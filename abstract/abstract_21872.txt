BACKGROUND
in computational biology, permutation tests have become a widely used tool to assess the statistical significance of an event under investigation. however, the common way of computing the p-value, which expresses the statistical significance, requires a very large number of permutations when small  p-values are to be accurately estimated. this is computationally expensive and often infeasible. recently, we proposed an alternative estimator, which requires far fewer permutations compared to the standard empirical approach while still reliably estimating small p-values  <cit> .


RESULTS
the proposed p-value estimator has been enriched with additional functionalities and is made available to the general community through a public website and web service, called epept. this means that the epept routines can be accessed not only via a website, but also programmatically using any programming language that can interact with the web. examples of web service clients in multiple programming languages can be downloaded. additionally, epept accepts data of various common experiment types used in computational biology. for these experiment types epept first computes the permutation values and then performs the p-value estimation. finally, the source code of epept can be downloaded.


CONCLUSIONS
different types of users, such as biologists, bioinformaticians and software engineers, can use the method in an appropriate and simple way.
