BACKGROUND
streptococcus suis serotype  <dig>  is a zoonotic agent that causes death and disease in both humans and swine. a better understanding of ss2-host molecular interactions is crucial for understanding ss <dig> pathogenesis and immunology. conventional genetic and biochemical approaches used to study ss <dig> virulence factors are unable to take into account the complex and dynamic environmental stimuli associated with the infection process. in this study, in vivo-induced antigen technology , an immunoscreening technique, was used to identify the immunogenic bacterial proteins that are induced or upregulated in vivo during ss <dig> infection.


RESULTS
convalescent-phase sera from pigs infected with ss <dig> were pooled, adsorbed against in vitro antigens, and used to screen ss <dig> genomic expression libraries. upon analysis of the identified proteins, we were able to assign a putative function to  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins. these included proteins implicated in cell envelope structure, regulation, molecule synthesis, substance and energy metabolism, transport, translation, and those with unknown functions. the in vivo-induced changes in the expression of  <dig> of these  <dig> genes were measured using real-time reverse transcription -pcr, revealing that the expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> genes was upregulated in the in vivo condition. the strain distribution of these  <dig> genes was analyzed by pcr, and they were found in the most virulent ss <dig> strains. in addition, protein sequence alignments of the newly identified proteins demonstrate that three are putative virulence-associated proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our results suggest that these in vivo-induced or upregulated genes may contribute to ss <dig> disease development. we hypothesize that the identification of factors specifically induced or upregulated during ss <dig> infection will aid in our understanding of ss <dig> pathogenesis and may contribute to the control ss <dig> outbreaks. in addition, the proteins identified using iviat may be useful potential vaccine candidates or virulence markers.
