BACKGROUND
many sxt/r391-like enterobacterial integrative conjugative elements  have been found to express an atypical, reca-dependent, uv-inducible, cell-sensitising phenotype observed as a reduction in post-irradiation cell survival rates in host cells. characterisation of a complete deletion library of the prototype ice r <dig> identified the involvement of three core ice genes, orfs90/ <dig> encoding a putative transcriptional enhancer complex, and orf <dig>  encoding a putative type iv secretion system, outer membrane-associated, conjugative transfer protein.


RESULTS
in this study, expression analysis of orf <dig> indicated that it was up-regulated as a result of uv irradiation in an orfs90/91-dependent manner. induced expression was found to be controlled from a site preceding the gene which required functional orfs90/ <dig>  expression of orfs90/ <dig> was in turn found to be regulated by orf <dig>  a Î» ci-like regulator. targeted construction of ice r <dig> deletions, rt-pcr and qrt-pcr analysis confirmed a regulatory link between orfs90/ <dig> and orf <dig> while site-directed mutagenesis of orf <dig> suggested an association with the cell membrane was a prerequisite for the cytotoxic effect.


CONCLUSIONS
because of the reca-dependence of the effect, we hypothesise that uv induction of reca results in cleavage of the ci-like ice-encoded repressor protein, the product of orf <dig>  this in turn allows expression of the transcriptional enhancer complex encoded by orfs90/ <dig>  which we conclude stimulates transcription of orf <dig>  whose product is directly responsible for the effect.
