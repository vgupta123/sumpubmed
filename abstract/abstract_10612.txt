BACKGROUND
plant mitochondrial genome has unique features such as large size, frequent recombination and incorporation of foreign dna. cytoplasmic male sterility  is caused by rearrangement of the mitochondrial genome, and a novel chimeric open reading frame  created by shuffling of endogenous sequences is often responsible for cms. the ogura-type male-sterile cytoplasm is one of the most extensively studied cytoplasms in brassicaceae. although the gene orf <dig> has been isolated as a determinant of ogura-type cms, no homologous sequence to orf <dig> has been found in public databases. therefore, how orf <dig> sequence was created is a mystery. in this study, we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of two radish mitochondrial genomes, namely, ogura- and normal-type genomes, and analyzed them to reveal the origin of the gene orf <dig> 


RESULTS
ogura- and normal-type mitochondrial genomes were assembled to  <dig> -bp and  <dig> -bp circular sequences, respectively. normal-type mitochondrial genome contained  <dig> protein-coding and three rrna genes, which are well conserved with the reported mitochondrial genome of rapeseed. ogura-type genomes contained same genes and additional atp <dig>  as for trna, normal-type contained  <dig> trnas, while ogura-type contained  <dig> trnas and one additional trnfm. the gene orf <dig> was specific to ogura-type mitochondrial genome, and no sequence homologous to it was found in normal-type genome. comparative analysis of the two genomes revealed that radish mitochondrial genome consists of  <dig> syntenic regions . it was shown that short repeats and overlapped repeats present in the edge of syntenic regions were involved in recombination events during evolution to interconvert two types of mitochondrial genome. ogura-type mitochondrial genome has four unique regions  that are non-syntenic to normal-type genome, and the gene orf <dig> was found to be located at the edge of the largest unique region. blast analysis performed to assign the unique regions showed that about 80% of the region was covered by short homologous sequences to the mitochondrial sequences of normal-type radish or other reported brassicaceae species, although no homology was found for the remaining 20% of sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
ogura-type mitochondrial genome was highly rearranged compared with the normal-type genome by recombination through one large repeat and multiple short repeats. the rearrangement has produced four unique regions in ogura-type mitochondrial genome, and most of the unique regions are composed of known brassicaceae mitochondrial sequences. this suggests that the regions unique to the ogura-type genome were generated by integration and shuffling of pre-existing mitochondrial sequences during the evolution of brassicaceae, and novel genes such as orf <dig> could have been created by the shuffling process of mitochondrial genome.
