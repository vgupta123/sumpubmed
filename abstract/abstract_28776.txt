BACKGROUND
developmental effects of exposure to endocrine disruptors can influence adult characters in mammals, but could also have evolutionary consequences. the aim of this study was to simulate an environmental exposure of an experimental population of mice to high amounts of nutritional phytoestrogens and to evaluate parameters of relevance for evolutionary change in the offspring. the effect of a continuous pre- and post-natal exposure to high levels of dietary isoflavones was evaluated on sexual maturity, morphometric parameters and dna methylation status in mice. adult mice male/female couples were fed ad libitum either with control diet  or isf diet  that contained the phytoestrogens genistein and daidzein). in the offspring we measured: i) the onset of vaginal opening  in females, ii) weight and size in all pups at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days post-natal  and iii) dna methylation patterns in skeletal α-actin , estrogen receptor-α and c-fos in adults .


RESULTS
vaginal opening was advanced in female pups in the isf group, from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  dpn to  <dig>  ±  <dig> . no differences in size or weight at ages  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> dpn were detected between experimental groups. nevertheless, at age  <dig> dpn reduced size and weight were observed in isf pups, in addition to suppression of normal gender differences in weight seen in the control group . also, natural differences seen in dna methylation at acta <dig> promoter in the offspring originated in the control group were suppressed in the isf group. acta <dig> is known to be developmentally regulated and related to morphomotric features.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates in mammals that individuals from a population subjected to a high consumption of isoflavones can show alterations in characters that may be of importance from an evolutionary perspective, such as epigenetic and morphometric characters or sexual maturation, a life history character.
