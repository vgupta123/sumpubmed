BACKGROUND
nontypeable haemophilus influenzae  is a significant human pathogen responsible for respiratory tract infections and the most common cause of recurrent otitis media. type ii toxin-antitoxin  systems are genetic elements that code for a stable protein toxin and a labile antitoxin that are thought to be involved in metabolic regulation of bacteria by enabling a switch to a dormant state under stress conditions. the contribution to infection persistence of the nthi ta loci vapbc- <dig> and vapxd was examined in this study.


RESULTS
deletions in vapbc- <dig>  vapxd and vapbc- <dig> vapxd significantly decreased the survival of nthi co-cultured with primary human respiratory tissue at the air-liquid interface and in the chinchilla model of otitis media. the ta deletions did not affect the growth dynamics of the mutants in rich media, their ultra-structural morphology, or display appreciable synergy during nthi infections. the toxin and antitoxin proteins of both pairs heterodimerized in vivo. consistent with our previous findings regarding the vapc- <dig> toxin, the nthi vapd toxin also displayed ribonuclease activity.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the vapbc- <dig> and vapxd ta loci enhance nthi survival and virulence during infection in vitro and in vivo using a mechanism of mrna cleavage, and that these conserved ta pairs represent new targets for the prophylaxis and therapy of otitis media and other nthi-caused mucosal diseases.
