BACKGROUND
swainsonine can cause serious disorders in reproduction of livestock, affecting both corpora lutea and reproductive hormone. the purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of swainsonine about the immunotoxic effects on pregnant mice in vivo.


RESULTS
the peripheral th1/th <dig> was detected by ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate -stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells  of phase pregnant mice. relevant cytokines in serum was evaluated after exposed to different dose of swainsonine. gene expression of il-1β, ifn-γ, tnf-α, il- <dig> and il- <dig> in pbmc was assessed by real-time pcr. swainsonine caused vacuolization phenomenon of lutein cells and a dose-effect relationship. the il-1β, ifn-γ and tnf-α were promoted, but il- <dig> and il- <dig> were suppressed in serum. swainsonine significantly increased il-1β, ifn-γ and tnf-α nuclear translocation and decreased il- <dig> and il- <dig>  swainsonine resulted in a significant shift of peripheral th1/th <dig> paradigm to th <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate that the immunomodulatory of swainsonine disturbed the regular immunologic state of the pregnant mice. this may increase the risk of abortion and probably resulted in serious disorders in reproduction of livestock.
