BACKGROUND
endothelial progenitor cells  play a fundamental role in not only blood vessel development but also post-natal vascular repair. currently epcs are defined as early and late epcs based on their biological properties and their time of appearance during in vitro culture. both epc types assist angiogenesis and have been linked to ischemia-related disorders, including coronary artery disease .


RESULTS
we found late epcs are more mobile than early epcs and matured endothelial cells . to pinpoint the mechanism, microrna profiles of early epcs late epcs, and ecs were deciphered by small rna sequencing. obtained signatures made up of both novel and known micrornas, in which anti-angiogenic micrornas such as mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are more abundant in matured ecs than in late epcs. overexpression of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> resulted in the reduction of genes involved in hypoxia response, metabolism, tgf-beta signalling, and cell motion. not only hamper late epc activities in vitro, both micrornas  also hindered in vivo vasculogenesis in a zebrafish model. reporter assays showed that mir- <dig>  but not mir- <dig>  targets the angiogenic factor ets <dig>  in contrast, pik3r <dig> is the target of mir- <dig>  but not mir- <dig> in late epcs. clinically, both mir-221-pik3r <dig> and mir-222-ets <dig> pairs are deregulated in late epcs of cad patients.


CONCLUSIONS
our results illustrate epcs and ecs exploit unique mirna modalities to regulate angiogenic features, and explain why late epc levels and activities are reduced in cad patients. these data will further help to develop new plasma biomarkers and therapeutic approaches for ischemia-related diseases or tumor angiogenesis.
