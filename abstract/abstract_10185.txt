BACKGROUND
chinese bayberry  is an important subtropical fruit crop and an ideal species for fruit quality research due to the rapid and substantial changes that occur during development and ripening, including changes in fruit color and taste. however, research at the molecular level is limited by a lack of sequence data. the present study was designed to obtain transcript sequence data and examine gene expression in bayberry developing fruit based on rna-seq and bioinformatic analysis, to provide a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling fruit quality changes during ripening.


RESULTS
rna-seq generated  <dig>  g raw data, which was then de novo assembled into  <dig>  unigenes with a mean length of  <dig> bp. approximately 80% of the unigenes  were annotated against public protein databases, and coding sequences  of  <dig>  unigenes were determined. over  <dig>  unigenes were differentially expressed during fruit ripening, with  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig>  down-regulated. go comparisons between the unigenes of these two types and interactive pathways  analysis found that energy-related metabolism was enhanced, and catalytic activity was increased. all genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were up-regulated during the fruit ripening processes, concurrent with color change. important changes in carbohydrate and acid metabolism in the ripening fruit are likely associated with expression of sucrose phosphate synthase  and glutamate decarboxylase .


CONCLUSIONS
mass sequence data of chinese bayberry was obtained and the expression profiles were examined during fruit ripening. the unigenes were annotated, providing a platform for functional genomic research with this species. using pathway mapping and expression profiles, the molecular mechanisms for changes in fruit color and taste during ripening were examined. this provides a reference for the study of complicated metabolism in non-model perennial species.
