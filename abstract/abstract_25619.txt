BACKGROUND
chronic n-methyl-d-aspartate  administration to rats is reported to increase arachidonic acid signaling and upregulate neuroinflammatory markers in rat brain. these changes may damage brain cells. in this study, we determined if chronic nmda administration  to rats would alter expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors in frontal cortex, compared with vehicle control.


RESULTS
using real time rt-pcr and western blotting, chronic nmda administration was shown to decrease mrna and protein levels of anti-apoptotic markers bcl- <dig> and bdnf, and of their transcription factor phospho-creb in the cortex. expression of pro-apoptotic bax, bad, and 14-3-3Î¶ was increased, as well as fluoro-jade b  staining, a marker of neuronal loss.


CONCLUSIONS
this alteration in the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors by chronic nmda receptor activation in this animal model may contribute to neuronal loss, and further suggests that the model can be used to examine multiple processes involved in excitotoxicity.
