BACKGROUND
uterine infections in dairy cows lower profitability of dairy operations. infections of the reproductive tract are related to the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria during the first three weeks after parturition. however, alterations in the vaginal microbiota composition in the first weeks after parturition remain poorly documented.


RESULTS
in this study, bacteria isolated from the vagina of healthy pregnant, and infected postpartum cows were characterised by random amplification of polymorphic dna  analysis and partial 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequencing. populations of bacilli and lactic acid bacteria of the genera enterococcus, lactobacillus, and pediococcus were present in both healthy and infected cows. infected cows had a significant increase in the vaginal enteric bacteria population which consisted mainly of escherichia coli. three e. coli isolates harboured the gene coding for shiga-like-toxin  i or ii. several isolates of the pediococcus acidilactici were found to produce the bacteriocin pediocin ach/pa- <dig>  quantitative pcr analyses of vaginal mucus samples collected from ten metritic cows before and after parturition confirmed the presence of the lactobacillus group ; enterobacteriaceae, e. coli, and bacilli. the presence of the pediocin ach/pa- <dig> structural gene and slt genes were also confirmed with qpcr.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, particularly e. coli, after parturition likely contributes to the development of metritis. our microbiota analysis extends the information related to the composition of commensal bacteria in the bovine female reproductive tract and may facilitate the development of novel intervention strategies for prevention of uterine infections in dairy cows.
