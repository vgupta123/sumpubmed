BACKGROUND
peptide identification based upon mass spectrometry  is generally achieved by comparison of the experimental mass spectra with the theoretically digested peptides derived from a reference protein database. obviously, this strategy could not identify peptide and protein sequences that are absent from a reference database. a customized protein database on the basis of rna-seq data is thus proposed to assist with and improve the identification of novel peptides. correspondingly, development of a comprehensive pipeline, which provides an end-to-end solution for novel peptide detection with the customized protein database, is necessary.


RESULTS
a pipeline with an r package, assigned as a pga utility, was developed that enables automated treatment to the tandem mass spectrometry  data acquired from different ms platforms and construction of customized protein databases based on rna-seq data with or without a reference genome guide. hence, pga can identify novel peptides and generate an html-based report with a visualized interface. on the basis of a published dataset, pga was employed to identify peptides, resulting in  <dig> novel peptides, including  <dig> single amino acid polymorphism  peptides,  <dig> indel peptides,  <dig> splice junction peptides, and  <dig> novel transcript-derived peptides. the software is freely available from http://bioconductor.org/packages/pga/, and the example reports are available at http://wenbostar.github.io/pga/.


CONCLUSIONS
the pipeline of pga, aimed at being platform-independent and easy-to-use, was successfully developed and shown to be capable of identifying novel peptides by searching the customized protein database derived from rna-seq data.
