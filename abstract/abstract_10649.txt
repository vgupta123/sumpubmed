BACKGROUND
polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers  method produces allele-specific dna bands of different lengths by adding four designed primers and it achieves the single nucleotide polymorphism  genotyping by electrophoresis without further steps. it is a time- and cost-effective snp genotyping method that has the advantage of simplicity. however, computation of feasible ctpp primers is still challenging.


RESULTS
in this study, we propose a ga -based method to design a feasible ctpp primer set to perform a reliable pcr experiment. the slc6a <dig> gene was tested with  <dig> snps for dry dock experiments which indicated that the proposed algorithm provides ctpp primers satisfied most primer constraints. one snp rs <dig> in the slc6a <dig> gene was taken as an example for the genotyping experiments using electrophoresis which validated the ga-based design method as providing reliable ctpp primer sets for snp genotyping.


CONCLUSIONS
the ga-based ctpp primer design method provides all forms of estimation for the common primer constraints of pcr-ctpp. the ga-ctpp program is implemented in java and a user-friendly input interface is freely available at http://bio.kuas.edu.tw/ga-ctpp/.
