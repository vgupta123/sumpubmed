BACKGROUND
human t-cell leukemia virus type  <dig>  is a human retrovirus that is etiologically linked to adult t-cell leukemia , an aggressive and fatal lymphoproliferative disease. the viral transactivator, tax, is thought to play an important role during the initial stages of cd4+ t-cell immortalization by htlv- <dig>  tax has been shown to activate transcription through creb/atf and nf-kb, and to alter numerous signaling pathways. these pleiotropic effects of tax modify the expression of a wide array of cellular genes. another viral protein encoded by htlv-i, p <dig>  has been shown to affect virus replication at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. little is currently known regarding the effect of p <dig> on the expression and nuclear export of cellular host mrna transcripts. identification of these rna may reveal new targets and increase our understanding of htlv-i pathogenesis. in this study, using primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we report a genome wide analysis of human genes transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally regulated by the htlv-i protein p <dig> 


RESULTS
using microarray analysis, we analyzed total and cytoplasmic cellular mrna transcript levels isolated from pbmcs to assess the effect of p <dig> on cellular rna transcript expression and their nuclear export. we report p30-dependent transcription resulting in the  <dig>  fold up-regulation of  <dig> genes and the down-regulation of  <dig> human genes. we further tested nuclear export of cellular mrna and found that p <dig> expression also resulted in a  <dig>  fold post-transcriptional down-regulation of  <dig> genes and the up-regulation of  <dig> genes.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, our study describes that expression of the htlv-i protein p <dig> both positively and negatively alters the expression of cellular transcripts. our study identifies for the first time the cellular genes for which nuclear export is affected by p <dig>  these results suggest that p <dig> may possess a more global function with respect to mrna transcription and the nuclear shuttling of cellular mrna transcripts. in addition, these alterations in gene expression may play a role in cell transformation and the onset of leukemia.
