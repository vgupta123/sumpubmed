BACKGROUND
pramipexole exists as two isomers. the s enantiomer is a potent d3/d <dig> receptor agonist and is extensively used in the management of pd. in contrast, the r enantiomer is virtually devoid of any of the da agonist effects. very limited studies are available to characterize the pharmacological spectrum of the r enantiomer of pramipexole.


RESULTS
using differentiated sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells as an experimental model, here we show that s and r pramipexole are endowed with equipotent efficacy in preventing cell death induced by h2o <dig> and inhibiting mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation. both pramipexole enantiomers prevented mitochondrial ros generation with a potency about ten times higher then that elicited for neuroprotection.


CONCLUSIONS
these results support the concept of both s and r pramipexole enantiomers as mitochondria-targeted antioxidants and suggest that the antioxidant, neuroprotective activity of these drugs is independent of both the chiral 6-propylamino group in the pramipexole molecule and the da receptor stimulation.
