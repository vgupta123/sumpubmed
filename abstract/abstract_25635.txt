BACKGROUND
clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats /crispr-associated protein  <dig> -mediated genome editing permits the rapid production of genetically engineered mice. to make the most of this innovative technology, a streamlined procedure is needed for the robust construction of crispr/cas <dig> vectors, the efficient preparation of mouse oocytes, and refined genotyping strategies. although we previously demonstrated the applicability of oocyte cryopreservation technologies and various genotyping methods in the production of transcription activator-like effector nuclease-mediated genome editing in mice, it has not yet been clarified whether these techniques can be applied to the crispr/cas9-mediated generation of knockout mice. in this study, we investigated easy, efficient, and robust methods of creating knockout mice using several crispr/cas <dig> systems.


RESULTS
we constructed three types of crispr/cas <dig> vectors expressing: 1) single guide rna  and cas <dig> nuclease, 2) two grnas and cas <dig> nickase, and 3) two grnas and foki-dcas <dig>  targeting the same genomic locus. these vectors were directly microinjected into the pronucleus of freeze-thawed fertilized oocytes, and surviving oocytes were transferred to pseudopregnant icr mice. cas <dig> nuclease resulted in the highest mutation rates with the lowest birth rates, while cas <dig> nickase resulted in the highest birth rates with the lowest mutation rates. foki-dcas <dig> presented well-balanced mutation and birth rates. furthermore, we constructed a single all-in-one foki-dcas <dig> vector targeting two different genomic loci, and validated its efficacy by blastocyst analysis, resulting in highly efficient simultaneous targeted mutagenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
our report offers several choices of researcher-friendly consolidated procedures for making crispr/cas9-mediated knockout mice, with sophisticated construction systems for various types of crispr vectors, convenient preparation of in vitro fertilized or mated freeze-thawed oocytes, and an efficient method of mutant screening.
