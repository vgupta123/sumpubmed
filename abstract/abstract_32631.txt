BACKGROUND
synchronization of action potentials between neurons is considered to be an encoding process that allows the grouping of various and multiple features of an image leading to a coherent perception. how this coding neuronal assembly is configured is debated. we have previously shown that the magnitude of synchronization between excited neurons is stimulus-dependent. in the present investigation we compare the levels of synchronization between synchronizing individual neurons and the synchronizing pool of cells to which they belong.


RESULTS
even though neurons belonged to their respective pools, some cells synchronized for all presented stimuli while others were rather selective and only a few stimulating conditions produced a significant synchronization. in addition the experiments show that one synchronizing pair rarely replicates the level of synchrony between corresponding groups of units. but when synchronizing clusters of neurons increase in number, the correlation  between unit synchronization and the synchronization between the entire pools of cells to which individual neurons belong improves.


CONCLUSIONS
these results prompt the hypothesis that random or spontaneous synchronization becomes progressively less important, whereas coincident spikes related to encoding properties of targets gain significance because a particular configuration of an image biases the excitatory inputs in favor of connections driven by the applied features of the stimulus.
