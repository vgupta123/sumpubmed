BACKGROUND
allergen recognition by dendritic cells  is a key event in the allergic cascade leading to production of ige antibodies. c-type lectins, such as the mannose receptor and dc-sign, were recently shown to play an important role in the uptake of the house dust mite glycoallergen der p  <dig> by dcs. in addition to mannose receptor  and dc-sign the high and low affinity ige receptors, namely fcϵri and fcϵrii , respectively, have been shown to be involved in allergen uptake and presentation by dcs.

objectives
this study aims at understanding the extent to which ige- and igg-facilitated der p  <dig> uptake by dcs influence t cell polarisation and in particular potential bias in favour of th <dig>  we have addressed this issue by using two chimaeric monoclonal antibodies produced in our laboratory and directed against a previously defined epitope on der p  <dig>  namely human ige 2c <dig> and igg <dig> 2c <dig> 


RESULTS
flow cytometry was used to establish the expression patterns of ige  and igg  receptors in relation to mr on dcs. the impact of fcϵri, fcϵrii, fcγri and mannose receptor mediated allergen uptake on th1/th <dig> cell differentiation was investigated using dc/t cell co-culture experiments. myeloid dcs showed high levels of fcϵri and fcγri expression, but low levels of cd <dig> and mr, and this has therefore enabled us to assess the role of ige and igg-facilitated allergen presentation in t cell polarisation with minimal interference by cd <dig> and mr. our data demonstrate that dcs that have taken up der p  <dig> via surface ige support a th <dig> response. however, no such effect was demonstrable via surface igg.


CONCLUSIONS
ige bound to its high affinity receptor plays an important role in der p  <dig> uptake and processing by peripheral blood dcs and in th <dig> polarisation of t cells.
