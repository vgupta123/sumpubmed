BACKGROUND
corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis can be classified into two biovars or biovars based on their nitrate-reducing ability. strains isolated from sheep and goats show negative nitrate reduction and are termed biovar ovis, while strains from horse and cattle exhibit positive nitrate reduction and are called biovar equi. however, molecular evidence has not been established so far to understand this difference, specifically if these c. pseudotuberculosis strains are under an evolutionary process.


RESULTS
the eric 1 +  <dig> minimum-spanning tree from  <dig> strains of c. pseudotuberculosis showed that the great majority of biovar ovis strains clustered together, but separately from biovar equi strains that also clustered amongst themselves. using evolutionarily conserved genes  and their corresponding amino acid sequences, we analyzed the phylogenetic relationship among eighteen strains of c. pseudotuberculosis belonging to both biovars ovis and equi. additionally, conserved point mutation based on structural variation analysis was also carried out to elucidate the genotype-phenotype correlations and speciation. we observed that the biovars are different at the molecular phylogenetic level and a probable anagenesis is occurring slowly within the species c. pseudotuberculosis.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together the results suggest that biovar equi is forming the biovar ovis. however, additional analyses using other genes and other bacterial strains are required to further support our anagenesis hypothesis in c. pseudotuberculosis.
