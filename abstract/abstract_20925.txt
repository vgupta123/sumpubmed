BACKGROUND
camp-induced ca2+-influx in dictyostelium is controlled by at least two non-mitochondrial ca2+-stores: acidic stores and the endoplasmic reticulum . the acidic stores may comprise the contractile vacuole network , the endosomal compartment and acidocalcisomes. here the role of cv in respect to function as a potential ca2+-store was investigated.


RESULTS
dajumin-gfp labeled contractile vacuoles were purified 7-fold by anti-gfp-antibodies in a magnetic field. the purified cv were shown for the first time to accumulate and release ca2+. release of ca2+ was elicited by arachidonic acid or the calmodulin antagonist w <dig>  the latter due to inhibition of the pump. the characteristics of ca2+-transport and ca2+-release of cv were compared to similarly purified vesicles of the er labeled by calnexin-gfp. since the cv proved to be a highly efficient ca2+-compartment we wanted to know whether or not it takes part in camp-induced ca2+-influx. we made use of the lvsa--mutant expected to display reduced ca2+-transport due to loss of calmodulin. we found a severe reduction of camp-induced ca2+-influx into whole cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the contractile vacuoles in dictyostelium represent a highly efficient acidic ca2+-store that is required for camp-induced ca2+-influx.
