BACKGROUND
huntington's disease, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, and spinocerebellar ataxia  <dig>  are caused by expansions in the polyglutamine  repeats in huntingtin protein , androgen receptor protein , and tata-binding protein , respectively. htt-associated protein  <dig> , a component of neuronal cytoplasmic stigmoid bodies , can sequester polyq-expanded htt and ar in stbs, thereby antagonizing formation of the nuclear aggregates associated with apoptotic neuron loss and disease progression.


RESULTS
clones of hap <dig> were isolated from unbiased two-hybrid screens for proteins that interact with tbp. domain mapping showed that regions between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> and between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> of mouse hap <dig> both bind specifically to the conserved c-terminal tbpcore domain, away from the tbp n-terminal polyq region. when fluorescently tagged versions of hap <dig> or tbp were expressed independently in cos- <dig>   <dig>  or neuro-2a cells, all tbp localized to the nucleus and all hap <dig> assembled into cytoplasmic stigmoid-like bodies . when co-expressed, a portion of the tbp was assembled into the hap <dig> stlbs while the remainder was localized to the nucleus. although the tbp n terminus, including the polyq region, was unnecessary for tbp-hap <dig> interaction, in mammalian cells, removal of the tbp qrepeat reduced the proportion of tbp that assembled into stlbs, whereas expansion of the qrepeat had no significant affect on tbp subcellular localization.


CONCLUSIONS
hap <dig> can sequester a subset of tbp protein away from the nucleus; extranuclear tbp sequestration is quantitatively influenced by the tbp polyq repeat. these results suggest hap <dig> could provide protection from sca <dig> neuropathology.
