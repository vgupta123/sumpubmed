BACKGROUND
orchids are one of the most diversified angiosperms, but few genomic resources are available for these non-model plants. in addition to the ecological significance, phalaenopsis has been considered as an economically important floriculture industry worldwide. we aimed to use massively parallel  <dig> pyrosequencing for a global characterization of the phalaenopsis transcriptome.


RESULTS
to maximize sequence diversity, we pooled rna from  <dig> samples of different tissues, various developmental stages, and biotic- or abiotic-stressed plants. we obtained  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  with an average read length of  <dig> bp. these reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. the unigenes were searched against the ncbi non-redundant  protein database. based on sequence similarity with known proteins, these analyses identified  <dig>  different genes . assembled sequences were annotated with gene ontology, gene family and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways. among these annotations, over  <dig> unigenes encoding putative transcription factors were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
pyrosequencing was effective in identifying a large set of unigenes from phalaenopsis. the informative est dataset we developed constitutes a much-needed resource for discovery of genes involved in various biological processes in phalaenopsis and other orchid species. these transcribed sequences will narrow the gap between study of model organisms with many genomic resources and species that are important for ecological and evolutionary studies.
