BACKGROUND
medicago sativa  is a low-input forage and potential bioenergy crop, and improving its yield and quality has always been a focus of the alfalfa breeding industry. transgenic alfalfa plants overexpressing a precursor of alfalfa microrna <dig>  were recently generated by our group. these plants  showed enhanced biomass yield, reduced internodal length, increased shoot branching and trichome density, and a delay in flowering time. transcripts of three squamosa-promoter binding protein-like  genes  were found to be targeted for cleavage by msmir <dig> in alfalfa.


RESULTS
to further illustrate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of mir <dig> in alfalfa, two mir156oe genotypes  were subjected to next generation rna sequencing with illumina hiseq. more than  <dig>  billion clean reads were obtained from our available sequenced samples. a total of  <dig>  transcripts were generated using trinity de novo assembly and  <dig>  significantly differentially expressed genes were detected in mir156oe plants a11a and a <dig> using the medicago truncatula genome as reference. a total of  <dig> genes  were selected for quantitative real-time pcr  validation, which showed that gene expression levels were largely consistent between qrt-pcr and rna-seq data. in addition to the established spl genes msspl <dig>  msspl <dig> and msspl <dig>  four new spls; msspl <dig>  msspl <dig>  msspl <dig> and msspl <dig> were also down-regulated significantly in both mir156oe plants. these seven spl genes belong to genes phylogeny clades vi, iv, viii, v and vii, which have been reported to be targeted by mir <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana. the gene ontology terms characterized electron transporter, starch synthase activity, sucrose transport, sucrose-phosphate synthase activity, chitin binding, sexual reproduction, flavonoid biosynthesis and lignin catabolism correlate well to the phenotypes of mir156oe alfalfa plants.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of changes in global gene expression in response to mir <dig> overexpression in alfalfa. the discovered mir156-targeted spl genes belonging to different clades indicate mir <dig> plays fundamental and multifunctional roles in regulating alfalfa plant development.
