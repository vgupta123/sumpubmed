BACKGROUND
 sirtuins  are nad+ dependent lysine deacetylases which are conserved from bacteria to humans and have been associated with longevity and lifespan extension. sirt <dig>  the best studied mammalian sirt is involved in many physiological and pathological processes and changes in sirt <dig> have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, with sirt <dig> having a suggested protective role in parkinson’s disease. in this study, we determined the effect of sirt <dig> on cell survival and α-synuclein aggregate formation in sh-sy5y cells following oxidative stress.


RESULTS
over-expression of sirt <dig> protected sh-sy5y cells from toxin induced cell death and the protection conferred by sirt <dig> was partially independent of its deacetylase activity, which was associated with the repression of nf-кb and cparp expression. sirt <dig> reduced the formation of α-synuclein aggregates but showed minimal co-localisation with α-synuclein. in post-mortem brain tissue obtained from patients with parkinson’s disease, parkinson’s disease with dementia, dementia with lewy bodies and alzheimer’s disease, the activity of sirt <dig> was observed to be down-regulated.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggests a negative effect of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative disorders and possibly explain the reduced activity of sirt <dig> in neurodegenerative disorders. our study shows that sirt <dig> is a pro-survival protein that is downregulated under cellular stress.
