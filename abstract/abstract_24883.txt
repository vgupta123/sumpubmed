BACKGROUND
rapid annotation and comparisons of genomes from multiple isolates  is becoming commonplace due to advances in sequencing technology. genome annotations can contain inconsistencies and errors that hinder comparative analysis even within a single species. tools are needed to compare and improve annotation quality across sets of closely related genomes.


RESULTS
we introduce a new tool, mugsy-annotator, that identifies orthologs and evaluates annotation quality in prokaryotic genomes using whole genome multiple alignment. mugsy-annotator identifies anomalies in annotated gene structures, including inconsistently located translation initiation sites and disrupted genes due to draft genome sequencing or pseudogenes. an evaluation of species pan-genomes using the tool indicates that such anomalies are common, especially at translation initiation sites. mugsy-annotator reports alternate annotations that improve consistency and are candidates for further review.


CONCLUSIONS
whole genome multiple alignment can be used to efficiently identify orthologs and annotation problem areas in a bacterial pan-genome. comparisons of annotated gene structures within a species may show more variation than is actually present in the genome, indicating errors in genome annotation. our new tool mugsy-annotator assists re-annotation efforts by highlighting edits that improve annotation consistency.
