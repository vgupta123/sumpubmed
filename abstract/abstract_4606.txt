BACKGROUND
the capability of human mesenchymal stem cells  derived of adult bone marrow to undergo in vitro hepatic differentiation was investigated.


RESULTS
exposure of hmsc to a cocktail of hepatogenic factors  failed to induce hepatic differentiation. sequential exposure to these factors , however, resembling the order of secretion during liver embryogenesis, induced both glycogen-storage and cytokeratin  <dig> expression. additional exposure of the cells to trichostatin a  considerably improved endodermal differentiation, as evidenced by acquisition of an epithelial morphology, chronological expression of hepatic proteins, including hepatocyte-nuclear factor -3β, alpha-fetoprotein , ck <dig>  albumin , hnf1α, multidrug resistance-associated protein  <dig> and ccaat-enhancer binding protein α, and functional maturation, i.e. upregulated alb secretion, urea production and inducible cytochrome p <dig> -dependent activity.


CONCLUSIONS
hmsc are able to undergo mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. tsa is hereby essential to promote differentiation of hmsc towards functional hepatocyte-like cells.
