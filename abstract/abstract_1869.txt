BACKGROUND
upregulation of vasoconstrictor receptors in cerebral arteries, including endothelin b  and 5-hydroxytryptamine 1b  receptors, has been suggested to contribute to delayed cerebral ischemia, a feared complication after subarachnoid hemorrhage . this receptor upregulation has been shown to be mediated by intracellular signalling via the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase  - extracellular regulated kinase 1/ <dig>  pathway. however, it is not known what event that trigger mek-erk1/ <dig> activation and vasoconstrictor receptor upregulation after sah.

we hypothesise that the drop in cerebral blood flow  and wall tension experienced by cerebral arteries in acute sah is a key triggering event. we here investigate the importance of the duration of this acute cbf drop in a rat sah model in which a fixed amount of blood is injected into the prechiasmatic cistern either at a high rate resulting in a short acute cbf drop or at a slower rate resulting in a prolonged acute cbf drop.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that the duration of the acute cbf drop is determining for a) degree of early erk1/ <dig> activation in cerebral arteries, b) delayed upregulation of vasoconstrictor receptors in cerebral arteries and c) delayed cbf reduction, neurological deficits and mortality. moreover, treatment with an inhibitor of mek-erk1/ <dig> signalling during an early time window from  <dig> to  <dig> h after sah was sufficient to completely prevent delayed vasoconstrictor receptor upregulation and improve neurological outcome several days after the sah.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest a series of events where 1) the acute cbf drop triggers early mek-erk1/ <dig> activation, which 2) triggers the transcriptional upregulation of vasoconstrictor receptors in cerebral arteries during the following days, where 3) the resulting enhanced cerebrovascular contractility contribute to delayed cerebral ischemia.
