BACKGROUND
bovine rotavirus  infection is common in young calves. this viral infection causes acute diarrhea leading to death. rapid identification of infected calves is essential to control brv successfully. therefore development of simple, highly specific, and sensitive detection method for brv is needed.


RESULTS
a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification  assay was developed and optimized for rapid detection of brv. specific primer sets were designed to target the sequences of the vp <dig> gene of the neonatal calf diarrhea virus  strain of brv. the rt-lamp assay was performed in a water bath for  <dig> minutes at 63Â°c, and the amplification products were visualized either directly or under ultraviolet light. this brv specific rt-lamp assay could detect  <dig>  copies of subtype a brv. no cross-reactions were detected with other bovine pathogens. the ability of rt-lamp to detect bovine rotavirus was further evaluated with  <dig> bovine rectal swab samples. twenty-nine of these samples were found to be positive for brv using rt-lamp. the brv-specific-rt-lamp results were also confirmed by real-time rt-pcr assay.


CONCLUSIONS
the bovine rotavirus-specific rt-lamp assay was highly sensitive and holds promise as a prompt and simple diagnostic method for the detection of group a bovine rotavirus infection in young calves.
