BACKGROUND
dna methylation, with a cryptic role in genome stability, gene transcription and expression, is involved in the drought response process in plants, but the complex regulatory mechanism is still largely unknown.


RESULTS
here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing  and identified long non-coding rnas on cotton leaves under drought stress and re-watering treatments. we obtained  <dig>  and  <dig>  differentially methylated regions  after drought stress and re-watering treatments, respectively. our data also showed that three sequence contexts, including mcpg, mchg, mchh, all presented a hyper-methylation pattern under drought stress and were nearly restored to normal levels after the re-watering treatment. among all the methylation variations, asymmetric chh methylation was the most consistent with external environments, suggesting that methylation/demethylation in a chh context may constitute a novel epigenetic modification in response to drought stress. combined with the targets of long non-coding rnas, we found that long non-coding rnas may mediate variations in methylation patterns by splicing into micrornas. furthermore, the many hormone-related genes with methylation variations suggested that plant hormones might be a potential mechanism in the drought response.


CONCLUSIONS
future crop-improvement strategies may benefit by taking into account not only the dna genetic variations in cotton varieties but also the epigenetic modifications of the genome.
