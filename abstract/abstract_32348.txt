BACKGROUND
zinc finger proteins  play an important role in regulating plant responses to abiotic stress. however, little is known about the function of lsd1-like-type zfp in saline-alkaline  stress resistance of rice. in this study, oslol <dig> , containing two lsd1-like-type c2c <dig> domains, was isolated and analyzed its protection roles in transgenic plants and yeast. oslol <dig> was located in the nucleus as evidenced by the bombardment of onion epidermal cells.


RESULTS
oslol <dig> expression significantly increased in rice leaves and roots under 150 mmol l- <dig> nacl, 30 mm nahco <dig>  and 10 mmol l- <dig> h2o <dig> treatment, respectively. overexpression of oslol <dig> in yeast resulted in sa tolerance at significant level. transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing oslol <dig> grew well in the presence ofboth nacl and nahco <dig> treatments, whereas wild-type plants exhibited chlorosis, stunted growth phenotype, and even death. sa stress caused significant changes in the malondialdehyde  contents in non-transgenic plants compared with those in transgenic lines. transgenic rice overexpressing oslol <dig> exhibited stronger resistance than nt under nahco <dig> treatment, as demonstrated by its greater shoot length, and fresh weight. the genes associated with oxidative stress, such as osapx <dig>  oscat, oscu/zn-sod, and osrgrc <dig>  were significantly upregulated in oslol5-overexpressing rice. the results suggested that oslol <dig> improved sa tolerance in plants, and regulated oxidative and salinity stress retardation via the active oxygen detoxification pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
the yeast invsci bacterium grew significantly better than the control strain under nacl, nahco <dig>  and h2o <dig> treatments. these findings illustrated that oslol <dig> overexpression enhanced yeast resistance for sa stress through active oxygen species. the present study showed that the oslol <dig> genes involved in the ros signaling pathways may combine with the model plant arabidopsis and rice in lds1-type zfp by ros signaling pathways that regulate cell necrosis. we speculated that the oslol <dig> active oxygen scavenging system may have coordinating roles. the present study further revealed that oslol <dig> zfp could regulate oxidative stress function, but could also provide a basis for salt-resistant rice strains.
