BACKGROUND
systems biological approach of molecular connectivity map has reached to a great interest to understand the gene functional similarities between the diseases. in this study, we developed a computational framework to build molecular connectivity maps by integrating mutated and differentially expressed genes of neurological and psychiatric diseases to determine its relationship with aging.


RESULTS
the systematic large-scale analyses of  <dig> human diseases create three classes of molecular connectivity maps. first, molecular interaction of disease protein network generates  <dig> proteins with  <dig> interactions, which determines the common genes/proteins between diseases. second, disease-disease network includes  <dig> positively scored disease-disease relationships. the comparison of these disease-disease pairs with medical subject headings  classification tree suggests 25% of the disease-disease pairs were in same disease area. the remaining can be a novel disease-disease relationship based on gene/protein similarity. inclusion of aging genes set showed  <dig> neurological and  <dig> psychiatric diseases have the strong association with aging. third and lastly, a curated disease biomarker network was created by relating the proteins/genes in specific disease contexts, such analysis showed  <dig> markers for  <dig> diseases. further, the overall quality of the results was achieved by a series of statistical methods, to avoid insignificant data in biological networks.


CONCLUSIONS
this study improves the understanding of the complex interactions that occur between neurological and psychiatric diseases with aging, which lead to determine the diagnostic markers. also, the disease-disease association results could be helpful to determine the symptom relationships between neurological and psychiatric diseases. together, our study presents many research opportunities in post-genomic biomarkers development.
