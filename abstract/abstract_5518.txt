BACKGROUND
the rational design of peptide-based specific inhibitors of the caspase family members using their x-ray crystallographies is an important strategy for chemical knockdown to define the critical role of each enzyme in apoptosis and inflammation. recently, we designed a novel potent peptide inhibitor, ac-dnld-cho, for caspase- <dig> using a new computational screening system named the amino acid positional fitness  method . here, we report the specificity of the dnld sequence against caspase- <dig> over other major caspase family members that participate in apoptosis by computational docking and site-directed mutagenesis studies.


RESULTS
ac-dnld-cho inhibits caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> activities with kiapp values of  <dig> ,  <dig> , > <dig>  and > <dig> nm, respectively. in contrast, a well-known caspase- <dig> inhibitor, ac-devd-cho, inhibits all these caspases with similar kiapp values. the selective recognition of a dnld sequence by caspase- <dig> was confirmed by substrate preference studies using fluorometric methylcoumarin-amide -fused peptide substrates. the bases for its selectivity and potency were assessed on a notable interaction between the substrate asn  and the caspase- <dig> residue ser <dig> in the s <dig> subsite and the tight interaction between the substrate leu  and the caspase- <dig> hydrophobic s <dig> subsite, respectively, in computational docking studies. expectedly, the substitution of ser <dig> with alanine resulted in loss of the cleavage activity on ac-dnld-mca and had virtually no effect on cleaving ac-devd-mca. these findings suggest that n and l residues in ac-dnld-cho are the determinants for the selective and potent inhibitory activity against caspase- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
on the basis of our results, we conclude that ac-dnld-cho is a reliable, potent and selective inhibitor of caspase- <dig>  the specific inhibitory effect on caspase- <dig> suggests that this inhibitor could become an important tool for investigations of the biological function of caspase- <dig>  furthermore, ac-dnld-cho may be an attractive lead compound to generate novel effective non-peptidic pharmaceuticals for caspase-mediated apoptosis diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and viral infection diseases.
