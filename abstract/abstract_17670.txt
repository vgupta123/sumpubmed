BACKGROUND
in red blood cells, protein  <dig>   is an  <dig> kda protein that stabilizes the spectrin-actin network and anchors it to the plasma membrane through its ferm domain. while the expression pattern of  <dig> r in mature red cells is relatively simple, a rather complex array of  <dig> r protein isoforms varying in n-terminal extensions, internal sequences and subcellular locations has been identified in nucleated cells. among these,  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda isoforms have different n-terminal extensions and are expressed either from aug1- or aug2-containing mrnas, respectively. these two types of mrnas, varying solely by presence/absence of  <dig> nucleotides  which contain the aug <dig> codon, are produced by alternative splicing of the  <dig> r pre-mrna. it is unknown whether the  <dig> nt region comprised between aug <dig> and aug <dig>  kept as a 5' untranslated region in aug2-containing mrnas, plays a role on  <dig> r mrna translation.


RESULTS
by analyzing the in vitro expression of a panel of naturally occurring  <dig> r cdnas, we observed that all aug1/aug2-containing cdnas gave rise to both long,  <dig> kda, and short,  <dig> kda,  <dig> r isoforms. more importantly, similar results were also observed in cells transfected with this set of  <dig> r cdnas. mutational studies indicated that the short isoforms were not proteolytic products of the long isoforms but products synthesized from aug <dig>  the presence of a cryptic promoter in the  <dig> r cdna sequence was also discounted. when a  <dig> nt sequence comprised between aug <dig> and aug <dig> was introduced into bicistronic vectors it directed protein expression from the second cistron. this was also the case when ribosome scanning was abolished by introduction of a stable hairpin at the 5' region of the first cistron. deletion analysis of the  <dig> nt sequence indicated that nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig> are essential for expression of the second cistron. the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein bound to the  <dig> nt active sequence but not to an inactive 3'-fragment of  <dig> nucleotides.


CONCLUSIONS
our study is the first demonstration of an internal ribosome entry site as a mechanism ensuring the production of  <dig> kda isoforms of protein  <dig> r. this mechanism might also account for the generation of  <dig> kda isoforms of  <dig> r from a downstream aug <dig>  our results reveal an additional level of control to  <dig> r gene expression pathways and will contribute to the understanding of the biology of proteins  <dig> r and their homologues, comprising an ample family of proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization.
