BACKGROUND
micrornas  play a fundamental role in the regulation of gene expression by translational repression or target mrna degradation. regulatory elements in mirna promoters are less well studied, but may reveal a link between their expression and a specific cell type.


RESULTS
to explore this link in myeloid cells, mirna expression profiles were generated from monocytes and dendritic cells . differences in mirna expression among monocytes, dcs and their stimulated progeny were observed. furthermore, putative promoter regions of mirnas that are significantly up-regulated in dcs were screened for transcription factor binding sites  based on tfbs motif matching score, the degree to which those tfbss are over-represented in the promoters of the up-regulated mirnas, and the extent of conservation of the tfbss in mammals.


CONCLUSIONS
analysis of evolutionarily conserved tfbss in dc promoters revealed preferential clustering of sites within  <dig> bp upstream of the precursor mirnas and that many mrnas of cognate tfs of the conserved tfbss were indeed expressed in the dcs. taken together, our data provide evidence that selected mirnas expressed in dcs have evolutionarily conserved tfbss relevant to dc biology in their promoters.
