BACKGROUND
intravascular catheter related infection  is one of the most serious nosocomial infections. diagnostic criteria include a positive culture from the catheter tip along with blood, yet in many patients with signs of infection, current culture techniques fail to identify pathogens on catheter segments. we hypothesised that a molecular examination of the bacterial community on short term arterial catheters  would improve our understanding of the variety of organisms that are present in this niche environment and would help develop new methods for the diagnosis of cri.


RESULTS
the whole bacterial community presenting on all acs was evaluated by molecular methods, i.e., a strategy of whole community dna extraction, pcr amplification followed by cloning and 16s rdna sequence analysis. ten acs were removed from patients suspected of cri and  <dig> clones from  <dig> "colonised" and  <dig> "uncolonised"  ac libraries were selected for sequencing and subsequent analysis. a total of  <dig> operational taxonomic units  were identified at the level of 97% similarity belonging to six bacterial divisions. an average of  <dig> otus were present in each ac, irrespective of colonisation status. conventional culture failed to reveal the majority of these bacteria.


CONCLUSIONS
there was no significant difference in the bacterial diversity between the 'uncolonised' and 'colonised' acs. this suggests that vascular devices cultured conventionally and reported as non infective may at times potentially be a significant source of sepsis in critically ill patients. alternative methods may be required for the accurate diagnosis of cri in critically ill patients.
