BACKGROUND
the three distinct types of kidneys, pronephros, mesonephros and metanephros, develop consecutively in vertebrates. the earliest form of embryonic kidney, the pronephros, is derived from intermediate mesoderm and the first expressed genes localized in the pronephros anlage are the transcription factors osr <dig>  osr <dig>  hnf1b, lhx <dig> and pax <dig>  here referred to as the early nephrogenic transcription factors. however, the pathway inducing nephrogenesis and the network of theses factors are poorly understood. treatment of the undifferentiated animal pole explant  of xenopus with activin a and retinoic acid induces pronephros formation providing a powerful tool to analyze key molecular events in nephrogenesis.


RESULTS
we have investigated the expression kinetics of the early nephrogenic transcription factors in activin a and retinoic acid treated animal caps and their potential to induce pronephric differentiation. in treated animal caps, expression of osr <dig>  osr <dig>  hnf1b and lhx <dig> are induced early, whereas pax <dig> expression occurs later implying an indirect activation. activin a alone is able to induce osr <dig> and lhx <dig> after three hours treatment in animal caps while retinoic acid fails to induce any of these nephrogenic transcription factors. the early expression of the five transcription factors and their interference with pronephros development when overexpressed in embryos suggest that these factors potentially induce nephrogenesis upon expression in animal caps. but no pronephros development is achieved by either overexpression of osr <dig>  by hnf1b injection with activin a treatment, or the combined application of lhx <dig> and pax <dig>  although they influenced the expression of several early nephrogenic transcription factors in some cases. in an additional approach we could show that hnf1b induces several genes important in nephrogenesis and regulates lhx <dig> expression by an hnf <dig> binding site in the lhx <dig> promoter.


CONCLUSIONS
the early nephrogenic transcription factors play an important role in nephrogenesis, but have no pronephros induction potential upon overexpression in animal caps. they activate transcriptional cascades that partially reflect the gene activation initiated by activin a and retinoic acid. significantly, hnf1b activates the lhx <dig> promoter directly, thus extending the known activin a regulation of the lhx <dig> gene via an activin a responsive element.
