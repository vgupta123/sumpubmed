BACKGROUND
ion homeostasis is essential for every cell and aberrant cation homeostasis is related to diseases like alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy. the mechanisms responsible for cation homeostasis are only partly understood. the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excellent organism to study fundamental aspects of cation homeostasis. in this study we investigated the transcriptional response of this yeast to potassium starvation by using serial analysis of gene expression -tag sequencing.


RESULTS
comparison of transcript levels in cells grown for 60 min in media without potassium with those in cells grown under standard potassium concentrations showed that the mrna levels of  <dig> genes were significantly  up-regulated more than  <dig> -fold during potassium starvation and the mrna levels of  <dig> genes significantly down-regulated. these genes belong to several functional categories. genes involved in stress response including hsp <dig>  yro <dig> and tpo <dig> and phosphate metabolism including pho <dig>  pho <dig> and spl <dig> were highly up-regulated. analysis of the promoter of pho <dig> encoding a high affinity phosphate transporter, revealed that increased pho <dig> rna levels are caused by both increased pho4-dependent transcription and decreased rna turnover. in the latter process antisense transcription may be involved. many genes involved in cell cycle control, and to a lesser extent genes involved in amino acid transport, were strongly down-regulated.


CONCLUSIONS
our study showed that yeast cells respond to potassium starvation in a complex way and reveals a direct link between potassium homeostasis and phosphate metabolism.
