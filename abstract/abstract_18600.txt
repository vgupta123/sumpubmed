BACKGROUND
small molecular cofactors or ligands play a crucial role in the proper functioning of cells. accurate annotation of their target proteins and binding sites is required for the complete understanding of reaction mechanisms. nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide  is one of the most commonly used organic cofactors in living cells, which plays a critical role in cellular metabolism, storage and regulatory processes. in the past, several nad binding proteins  have been reported in the literature, which are responsible for a wide-range of activities in the cell. attempts have been made to derive a rule for the binding of nad+ to its target proteins. however, so far an efficient model could not be derived due to the time consuming process of structure determination, and limitations of similarity based approaches. thus a sequence and non-similarity based method is needed to characterize the nad binding sites to help in the annotation. in this study attempts have been made to predict nad binding proteins and their interacting residues  from amino acid sequence using bioinformatics tools.


RESULTS
we extracted  <dig> proteins chains from  <dig> nad binding proteins whose structure is available in protein data bank. then we removed all redundant protein chains and finally obtained  <dig> non-redundant nad binding protein chains, where no two chains have more than 40% sequence identity. in this study all models were developed and evaluated using five-fold cross validation technique on the above dataset of  <dig> nad binding proteins. while certain type of residues are preferred  in nad interaction, residues like ala, glu, leu, lys are not preferred. a support vector machine  based method has been developed using various window lengths of amino acid sequence for predicting nad interacting residues and obtained maximum matthew's correlation coefficient   <dig>  with accuracy  <dig> % at window length  <dig>  we also developed a svm based method using evolutionary information in the form of position specific scoring matrix  and obtained maximum mcc  <dig>  with accuracy  <dig> %.


CONCLUSIONS
for the first time a sequence-based method has been developed for the prediction of nad binding proteins and their interacting residues, in the absence of any prior structural information. the present model will aid in the understanding of nad+ dependent mechanisms of action in the cell. to provide service to the scientific community, we have developed a user-friendly web server, which is available from url http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/nadbinder/.
