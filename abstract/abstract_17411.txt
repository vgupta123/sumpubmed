BACKGROUND
micrornas  regulate gene expression by mediating gene silencing at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in higher plants. mirnas and related target genes have been widely studied in model plants such as arabidopsis and rice; however, the number of identified mirnas in soybean  is limited, and global identification of the related mirna targets has not been reported in previous research.


RESULTS
in our study, a small rna library and a degradome library were constructed from developing soybean seeds for deep sequencing. we identified  <dig> new mirnas in soybean by bioinformatic analysis and further confirmed their expression by stem-loop rt-pcr. the mirna star sequences of  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> new mirnas were also discovered, providing additional evidence for the existence of mirnas. through degradome sequencing,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were identified as targets of annotated mirnas and new mirnas, respectively. go analysis indicated that many of the identified mirna targets may function in soybean seed development. additionally, a soybean homolog of arabidopsis suppressor of gene sliencing  <dig>  was detected as a target of the newly identified mirna soy_ <dig>  suggesting the presence of feedback control of mirna biogenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified large numbers of mirnas and their related target genes through deep sequencing of a small rna library and a degradome library. our study provides more information about the regulatory network of mirnas in soybean and advances our understanding of mirna functions during seed development.
