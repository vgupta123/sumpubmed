BACKGROUND
enteropathogenic  and enterohaemorrhagic  escherichia coli are responsible for food poisoning  in humans in developed countries. cattle are considered to be an important reservoir of ehec and epec strains for humans. moreover, some of the strains, belonging to the o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig> serogroups, for example, are also responsible for digestive disorders in calves. the translocated intimin receptor , the intimin  and the tir-cytoskeleton coupling protein  represent three virulence factors implicated in the intimate attachment of the bacteria to the eukaryotic cell. major variants have already been described for these genes among the different serogroups but minor variations have not often been studied. in this study, we examined the polymorphisms of the tir, eae and tccp <dig> genes of o <dig> strains  with the aim to determine whether these polymorphisms are host specific or not.


RESULTS
of the  <dig> tested strains,  <dig> strains  presented one or several polymorphisms in the tir and eae genes, which have never previously been described. concerning tccp <dig> detection,  <dig> of the  <dig> strains  were found to be positive for this gene. most of the strains were found to possess tccp <dig> variants described in strains of serogroup o <dig>  nevertheless, three strains had tccp <dig> genes respectively described in strains of serogroup o <dig>  o <dig> and o <dig>  moreover, none of the polymorphisms was statistically specific to the bovine or the human isolates. nevertheless, the two major variants of tccp <dig> were statistically associated with the pathotype .


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, tir and eae gene polymorphisms were found not to be numerous and not to be predominantly synonymous. moreover, no difference was observed between human and bovine strains regarding the presence of polymorphisms. finally, some tccp <dig> variants appeared to be pathotype specific. further investigations need to be performed on a larger number of strains in order to confirm this specificity.
