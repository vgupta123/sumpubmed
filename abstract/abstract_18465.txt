BACKGROUND
rice false smut caused by villosiclava virens is a devastating fungal disease that spreads in major rice-growing regions throughout the world. however, the genomic information for this fungal pathogen is limited and the pathogenic mechanism of this disease is still not clear. to facilitate genetic, molecular and genomic studies of this fungal pathogen, we constructed the first bac-based physical map and performed the first genome survey for this species.


RESULTS
high molecular weight genomic dna was isolated from young mycelia of the villosiclava virens strain uv-8b and a high-quality, large-insert and deep-coverage bacterial artificial chromosome  library was constructed with the restriction enzyme hindiii. the bac library consisted of  <dig>  clones, which covers  <dig> -fold of the uv-8b genome, with an average insert size of 140 kb and an empty clone rate of lower than 1%. bac fingerprinting generated successful fingerprints for  <dig>  bac clones. using the fingerprints, a whole genome-wide bac physical map was constructed that contained  <dig> contigs  spanning  <dig>  mb in physical length. bidirectional-end sequencing of  <dig>  bac clones generated  <dig>  high quality bac end sequences , with a total length of  <dig> ,658 bp, representing  <dig> % of the genome sequence. analysis of the bess revealed general genome information, including  <dig> % gc content,  <dig> % repetitive sequences,  <dig> /mb simple sequence repeat  density and approximately  <dig> % coding regions. sequence comparisons to other available fungal genome sequences through bess showed high similarities to metarhizium anisopliae, trichoderma reesei, nectria haematococca and cordyceps militaris, which were generally in agreement with the 18s rrna gene analysis results.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides the first bac-based physical map and genome information for the important rice fungal pathogen villosiclava virens. the bac clones, physical map and genome information will serve as fundamental resources to accelerate the genetic, molecular and genomic studies of this pathogen, including positional cloning, comparative genomic analysis and whole genome sequencing. the bac library and physical map have been opened to researchers as public genomic resources .
