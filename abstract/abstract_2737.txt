BACKGROUND
amino acid point mutations  may change protein structure and function. however, no method directly predicts the impact of mutations on structure. here, we compare pairs of pentamers  that locally change protein three-dimensional structure  to those that do not alter structure . mutations that alter structure locally can be distinguished from those that do not through a machine-learning  method.


RESULTS
the method achieved a rather high overall performance . this discriminative power was particularly unexpected given the enormous structural variability of pentamers. mutants for which our method predicted a change of structure were also enriched in terms of disrupting stability and function. although distinguishing change and no change in structure, the new method overall failed to distinguish between mutants with and without effect on stability or function.


CONCLUSIONS
local structural change can be predicted. future work will have to establish how useful this new perspective on predicting the effect of nssnps will be in combination with other methods.
