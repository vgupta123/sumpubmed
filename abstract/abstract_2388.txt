BACKGROUND
rack <dig> is a versatile scaffold protein in mammals, regulating diverse developmental processes. unlike in non-plant organisms where rack <dig> is encoded by a single gene, arabidopsis genome contains three rack <dig> homologous genes, designated as rack1a, rack1b and rack1c, respectively. previous studies indicated that the loss-of-function alleles of rack1a displayed multiple defects in plant development. however, the functions of rack1b and rack1c remain elusive. further, the relationships between three rack <dig> homologous genes are unknown.


RESULTS
we isolated mutant alleles with loss-of-function mutations in rack1b and rack1c, and examined the impact of these mutations on plant development. we found that unlike in rack1a, loss-of-function mutations in rack1b or rack1c do not confer apparent defects in plant development, including rosette leaf production and root development. analyses of rack1a, rack1b and rack1c double and triple mutants, however, revealed that rack1b and rack1c can enhance the rack1a mutant's developmental defects, and an extreme developmental defect and lethality were observed in rack1a rack1b rack1c triple mutant. complementation studies indicated that rack1b and rack1c are in principle functionally equivalent to rack1a. gene expression studies indicated that three rack <dig> genes display similar expression patterns but are expressed at different levels. further, rack <dig> genes positively regulate each other's expression.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggested that rack <dig> genes are critical regulators of plant development and that rack <dig> genes function in an unequally redundant manner. both the difference in rack <dig> gene expression level and the cross-regulation are likely the molecular determinants of their unequal genetic redundancy.
