BACKGROUND
in the mid 20th century, ernst mayr and theodosius dobzhansky championed the significance of circular overlaps or ring species as the perfect demonstration of speciation, yet in the over  <dig> years since, only a handful of such taxa are known. we developed a topographic model to evaluate whether the geographic barriers that favor processes leading to ring species are common or rare, and to predict where other candidate ring barriers might be found.


RESULTS
of the  <dig>  geographic barriers identified on the planet, only about 1% are topographically similar to barriers associated with known ring taxa, with most of the likely candidates occurring in under-studied parts of the world . predicted barriers separate into two distinct categories:  single cohesive barriers , associated with taxa that differentiate at smaller spatial scales ; and  composite barriers - formed by groups of barriers  in close geographic proximity  - associated with taxa that differentiate at larger spatial scales ). when evaluated globally, we find a large number of cohesive barriers that are topographically similar to those associated with known ring taxa. yet, compared to cohesive barriers, an order of magnitude fewer composite barriers are similar to those that favor ring divergence in species with higher dispersal.


CONCLUSIONS
while these findings confirm that the topographic conditions that favor evolutionary processes leading to ring speciation are, in fact, rare, they also suggest that many understudied natural systems could provide valuable demonstrations of continuous divergence towards the formation of new species. distinct advantages of the model are that it  requires no a priori information on the relative importance of features that define barriers,  can be replicated using any kind of continuously distributed environmental variable, and  generates spatially explicit hypotheses of geographic species formation. the methods developed here - combined with study of the geographical ecology and genetics of taxa in their environments - should enable recognition of ring species phenomena throughout the world.
