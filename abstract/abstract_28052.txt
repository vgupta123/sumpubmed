BACKGROUND
brucella abortus is an intracellular pathogen which can infect and persist in host cells through multiple interactions. above all, its interaction to host cell receptor is important to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of b. abortus. accordingly, we demonstrated that platelet-activating factor receptor  affects host cell response against b. abortus infection.


RESULTS
first of all, b. abortus infection to macrophage induces secretion of platelet-activating factor , which is a pafr agonist. the stimulation of pafr by paf remarkably increases b. abortus uptake into macrophages. it induces janus kinase  <dig>  and p38α phosphorylation, indicating that pafr-mediated activation of jak <dig> signaling leads to enhanced uptake of b. abortus. moreover, the dynamics of f-actin polymerization revealed that pafr-mediated b. abortus uptake is related with the reorganization of f-actin and jak <dig>  upon b. abortus phagocytosis, reduced pafr in the membrane and subsequently increased levels of pafr colocalization with endosomes were observed which indicate that b. abortus uptake into macrophages allowed pafr trafficking to endosomes.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that pafr has a compelling involvement in b. abortus uptake as a promoter of phagocytosis, which is associated with jak <dig> activation. thus, our findings establish a novel insight into a receptor-related phagocytic mechanism of b. abortus.
