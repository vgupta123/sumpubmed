BACKGROUND
the nematode caenorhabditis elegans is a major model organism in laboratory biology. very little is known, however, about its ecology, including where it proliferates. in the past, c. elegans was mainly isolated from human-made compost heaps, where it was overwhelmingly found in the non-feeding dauer diapause stage.


RESULTS
c. elegans and c. briggsae were found in large, proliferating populations in rotting plant material  in several locations in mainland france. both species were found to co-occur in samples isolated from a given plant species. population counts spanned a range from one to more than  <dig>  caenorhabditis individuals on a single fruit or stem. some populations with an intermediate census size  contained no dauer larvae at all, whereas larger populations always included some larvae in the pre-dauer or dauer stages. we report on associated micro-organisms, including pathogens. we systematically sampled a spatio-temporally structured set of rotting apples in an apple orchard in orsay over four years. c. elegans and c. briggsae were abundantly found every year, but their temporal distributions did not coincide. c. briggsae was found alone in summer, whereas both species co-occurred in early fall and c. elegans was found alone in late fall. competition experiments in the laboratory at different temperatures show that c. briggsae out-competes c. elegans at high temperatures, whereas c. elegans out-competes c. briggsae at lower temperatures.


CONCLUSIONS
c. elegans and c. briggsae proliferate in the same rotting vegetal substrates. in contrast to previous surveys of populations in compost heaps, we found fully proliferating populations with no dauer larvae. the temporal sharing of the habitat by the two species coincides with their temperature preference in the laboratory, with c. briggsae populations growing faster than c. elegans at higher temperatures, and vice at lower temperatures.
