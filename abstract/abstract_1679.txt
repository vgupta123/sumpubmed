BACKGROUND
mannheimia haemolytica is a commensal bacterium that resides in the upper respiratory tract of cattle that can play a role in bovine respiratory disease. prophages are common in the m. haemolytica genome and contribute significantly to host diversity. the objective of this research was to undertake comparative genomic analysis of phages induced from strains of m. haemolytica serotype a <dig> , a <dig>  and a <dig> .


RESULTS
overall, four p2-like , four λ-like  and one mu-like  phages were identified. all p2-like phages are collinear with the temperate phage φmhaa1-phl <dig> with 535ap <dig>  2256ap <dig> and 1152ap <dig> being most closely related, followed by 587ap <dig> and 1127ap <dig>  lambdoid phages are not collinear with any other known λ-type phages, with 587ap <dig> being distinct from 535ap <dig>  3927ap <dig> and 1152ap <dig>  all λ-like phages contain genes encoding a toxin-antitoxin  system and cell-associated haemolysin xhla. the mu-like phage induced from 3927a is closely related to the phage remnant φmhamu <dig> from m. haemolytica phl <dig>  with similar mu-like phages existing in the genomes of m. haemolytica 535a and 587a.


CONCLUSIONS
this is among the first reports of both λ- and mu-type phages being induced from m. haemolytica. compared to phages induced from commensal strains of m. haemolytica serotype a <dig>  those induced from the more virulent a <dig> and a <dig> serotypes are more closely related. moreover, when p2-, λ- and mu-like phages co-existed in the m. haemolytica genome, only p2- and λ-like phages were detected upon induction, suggesting that mu-type phages may be more resistant to induction. toxin-antitoxin gene cassettes in λ-like phages may contribute to their genomic persistence or the establishment of persister subpopulations of m. haemolytica. further work is required to determine if the cell-associated haemolysin xhla encoded by λ-like phages contributes to the pathogenicity and ecological fitness of m. haemolytica.
