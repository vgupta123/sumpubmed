BACKGROUND
female condition-dependent variation in mate preference may have important evolutionary implications, not only within the same population but also among populations. there are few experiments, however, on how condition and/or genotype influences female mate preferences. the black throat patch of the male house sparrow, passer domesticus, is an intensively studied plumage trait. it is often referred to as a 'badge of status' and seems to be involved in female mate choice, but differences exist among populations. between-population variation in mate preference may occur for condition-dependent mate preferences. we tested the hypothesis that female preference may vary with female quality . therefore, we measured female preference for badge size using an aviary two-choice test in which females were presented with two males that had different sizes of badges .


RESULTS
overall we did not find a female preference for enlarged or average badges, but low-quality females spent more time near average badge males. conversely, high-quality females did not show a clear preference.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, these results indicate that female preference varies with female quality. differences in female condition are causes of within-population variation in mating preferences. to our knowledge, our results provide one of the first experimental evidences that variation in preference for a male ornament is associated with female condition. in our study, however, only females of low condition displayed a clear mate preference. differences observed among populations could be partly explained by differences in female condition.
