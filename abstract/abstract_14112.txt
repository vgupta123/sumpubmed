BACKGROUND
loblolly pine  is one of the most widely planted and commercially important forest tree species in the usa and worldwide, and is an object of intense genomic research. however, whole genome resequencing in loblolly pine is hampered by its large size and complexity and a lack of a good reference. as a valid and more feasible alternative, entire exome sequencing was hence employed to identify the gene-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms  and to genotype the sampled trees.


RESULTS
the exons were captured in the adept <dig> association mapping population of  <dig> clonally-propagated loblolly pine trees using nimblegen oligonucleotide hybridization probes, and then exome-enriched genomic dna fragments were sequenced using the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform. oligonucleotide probes were designed based on  <dig>  exons  partitioned from the loblolly pine reference genome . the probes covered  <dig>  % of the target regions. capture efficiency was high; on average, 67 % of the sequence reads generated for each tree could be mapped to the capture target regions, and more than 70 % of the captured target bases had at least 10x sequencing depth per tree. a total of  <dig>  high quality snps were identified after filtering. among them, 53 % were located in coding regions , 5 % in 5’ or 3’ untranslated regions  and 42 % in non-target and non-coding regions, such as introns and adjacent intergenic regions collaterally captured. we found that linkage disequilibrium  decayed very rapidly, with the correlation coefficient  between pairs of snps linked within single scaffolds decaying to half maximum  within 55 bp, to r2 =  <dig>  within 192 bp, and to r2 =  <dig>  within 451 bp. population structure analysis using unlinked snps demonstrated the presence of two main distinct clusters representing western and eastern parts of the loblolly pine range included in our sample of trees.


CONCLUSIONS
the obtained results demonstrated the efficiency of exome capture for genotyping species such as loblolly pine with a large and complex genome. the highly diverse genetic variation reported in this study will be a valuable resource for future genetic and genomic research in loblolly pine.
