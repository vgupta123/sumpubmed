BACKGROUND
sign-language comprehension activates the auditory cortex in deaf subjects. it is not known whether this functional plasticity in the temporal cortex is age dependent. we conducted functional magnetic-resonance imaging in six deaf signers who lost their hearing before the age of  <dig> years, five deaf signers who were > <dig> years of age at the time of hearing loss and six signers with normal hearing. the task was sentence comprehension in japanese sign language.


RESULTS
the sign-comprehension tasks activated the planum temporale of both early- and late-deaf subjects, but not that of hearing signers. in early-deaf subjects, the middle superior temporal sulcus was more prominently activated than in late-deaf subjects.


CONCLUSIONS
as the middle superior temporal sulcus is known to respond selectively to human voices, our findings suggest that this subregion of the auditory-association cortex, when deprived of its proper input, might make a functional shift from human voice processing to visual processing in an age-dependent manner.
