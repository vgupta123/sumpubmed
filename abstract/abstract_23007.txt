BACKGROUND
angiotensin ii  effects on intestinal na+ transport may be multifactorial. to determine if aii might have a direct effect on intestinal epithelial na+ transport, we investigated its actions on na+ transport in human intestinal epithelial caco2bbe cells.


RESULTS
aii increased apical  sodium-hydrogen exchanger - <dig>  but not nhe <dig>  activity within one hour. similarly, only apical membrane nhe <dig> abundance increased at 1– <dig> hours without any change in total nhe <dig> protein abundance. from 4– <dig> hours, aii stimulated progressively larger increases in apical nhe <dig> activity and surface abundance, which was associated with increases in nhe <dig> protein expression. at 4– <dig> hours, nhe <dig> mrna increases over baseline expression, suggesting increased gene transcription. this was supported by aii induced increases in rat nhe <dig> gene promoter-reporter activity. aii induction of nhe <dig> was blocked by the aii type i receptor antagonist losartan. acute changes in aii-induced increases in nhe <dig> exocytosis were blocked by a phospholipase c inhibitor, an arachidonic acid cytochrome p <dig> epoxygenase inhibitor, as well as phosphatidylinositol  <dig> kinase  inhibitors and akt inhibitor, partially blocked by a metalloproteinase inhibitor and an egf  receptor kinase inhibitor, but not affected by an inhibitor of mek- <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that angiotensin ii has a direct role in regulating intestinal fluid and electrolyte absorption which may contribute to its overall effects in regulation systemic volume and blood pressure. aii activates several key signaling pathways that induce acute and chronic changes in nhe <dig> membrane trafficking and gene transcription.
