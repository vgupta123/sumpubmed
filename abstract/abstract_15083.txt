BACKGROUND
chickpea is a major crop in many drier regions of the world where it is an important protein-rich food and an increasingly valuable traded commodity. the wild annual cicer species are known to possess unique sources of resistance to pests and diseases, and tolerance to environmental stresses. however, there has been limited utilization of these wild species by chickpea breeding programs due to interspecific crossing barriers and deleterious linkage drag. molecular genetic diversity analysis may help predict which accessions are most likely to produce fertile progeny when crossed with chickpea cultivars. while, trait-markers may provide an effective tool for breaking linkage drag. although ssr markers are the assay of choice for marker-assisted selection of specific traits in conventional breeding populations, they may not provide reliable estimates of interspecific diversity, and may lose selective power in backcross programs based on interspecific introgressions. thus, we have pursued the development of gene-based markers to resolve these problems and to provide candidate gene markers for qtl mapping of important agronomic traits.


RESULTS
an est library was constructed after subtractive suppressive hybridization  of root tissue from two very closely related chickpea genotypes . a total of  <dig> est-based markers were designed from  <dig> sequences with functional annotations and these were tested on c. arietinum. forty-four est markers were polymorphic when screened across nine cicer species . parsimony and pcoa analysis of the resultant est-marker dataset indicated that most accessions cluster in accordance with the previously defined classification of primary , secondary , and tertiary  gene-pools. a large proportion of est alleles  were only present in one or two of the accessions tested whilst the others were represented in up to twelve of the accessions tested.


CONCLUSIONS
gene-based markers have proven to be effective tools for diversity analysis in cicer and est diversity analysis may be useful in identifying promising candidates for interspecific hybridization programs. the est markers generated in this study have detected high levels of polymorphism amongst both common and rare alleles. this suggests that they would be useful for allele-mining of germplasm collections for identification of candidate accessions in the search for new sources of resistance to pests / diseases, and tolerance to abiotic stresses.
