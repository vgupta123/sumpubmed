BACKGROUND
mapping expression quantitative trait loci  of targeted genes represents a powerful and widely adopted approach to identify putative regulatory variants. linking regulation differences to specific genes might assist in the identification of networks and interactions. the objective of this study is to identify eqtl underlying expression of four gene families encoding isoflavone synthetic enzymes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway, which are phenylalanine ammonia-lyase , chalcone synthase , 2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase  and flavanone 3-hydroxylase . a population of  <dig> recombinant inbred lines , derived from a cross between soybean cultivar ‘zhongdou 27’  and ‘jiunong 20’ , and a total of  <dig> simple sequence repeat  markers were used in this study. overlapped loci of eqtls and phenotypic qtls  were analyzed to identify the potential candidate genes underlying the accumulation of isoflavone in soybean seed.


RESULTS
thirty three eqtls  underlying the transcript abundance of the four gene families were identified on fifteen chromosomes. the eqtls between satt278-sat_ <dig>  sat_134-sct_ <dig> and satt149-sat_ <dig> underlie the expression of both ifs and chs genes. five eqtl intervals were overlapped with pqtls. a total of eleven candidate genes within the overlapped eqtl and pqtl were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
these results will be useful for the development of marker-assisted selection to breed soybean cultivars with high or low isoflavone contents and for map-based cloning of new isoflavone related genes.
