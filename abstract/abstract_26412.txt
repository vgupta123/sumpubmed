BACKGROUND
we evaluated the effects of 3-o-methyldopa , a metabolite of l-dopa which is formed by catechol-o-methyltransferase , on the uptake, metabolism, and neuroprotective effects of l-dopa in striatal astrocytes. we examined changes in the numbers of dopaminergic neurons after treatment with l-dopa and 3-omd or entacapone, a peripheral comt inhibitor, using primary cultured mesencephalic neurons and striatal astrocytes.


RESULTS
the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic neurons was not affected by l-dopa treatment in mesencephalic neurons alone. however, the increase in viability of dopaminergic neurons in the presence of astrocytes was further enhanced after methyl-l-dopa treatment  in mixed cultured mesencephalic neurons and striatal astrocytes. the neuroprotective effect of 25 µm l-dopa was almost completely inhibited by simultaneous treatment with 3-omd , and was enhanced by concomitant treatment with entacapone . the uptake of l-dopa into and the release of glutathione from striatal astrocytes after l-dopa treatment  were inhibited by simultaneous exposure to 3-omd .


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that l-dopa exerts its neuroprotective effect on dopaminergic neurons via astrocytes and that 3-omd competes with l-dopa by acting on target molecule  released from astrocytes. since some amount of entacapone can cross the blood–brain barrier, this reagent may enhance l-dopa transportation by inhibiting comt and increase the astrocyte-mediated neuroprotective effects of l-dopa on dopaminergic neurons.
