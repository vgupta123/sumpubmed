BACKGROUND
cells in some tissues acquire a polarisation in the plane of the tissue in addition to apical-basal polarity. this polarisation is commonly known as planar cell polarity and has been found to be important in developmental processes, as planar polarity is required to define the in-plane tissue coordinate system at the cellular level.


RESULTS
we have built an in-silico functional model of cellular polarisation that includes cellular asymmetry, cell-cell signalling and a response to a global cue. the model has been validated and parameterised against domineering non-autonomous wing hair phenotypes in drosophila.


CONCLUSIONS
we have carried out a systematic comparison of in-silico polarity phenotypes with patterns observed in vivo under different genetic manipulations in the wing. this has allowed us to classify the specific functional roles of proteins involved in generating cell polarity, providing new hypotheses about their specific functions, in particular for pk and dsh. the predictions from the model allow direct assignment of functional roles of genes from genetic mosaic analysis of drosophila wings.
