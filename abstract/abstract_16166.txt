BACKGROUND
understanding the phenotypic consequences of interactions between arthropod-borne viruses  and their mosquito hosts has direct implications for predicting the evolution of these relationships and the potential for changes in epidemiological patterns. although arboviruses are generally not highly pathogenic to mosquitoes, pathology has at times been noted. here, in order to evaluate the potential costs of west nile virus  infection and resistance in a primary wnv vector, and to assess the extent to which virus-vector relationships are species-specific, we performed fitness studies with and without wnv exposure using a highly susceptible culex pipiens mosquito colony. specifically, we measured and compared survival, fecundity, and feeding rates in bloodfed mosquitoes that were  infected following wnv exposure ,  uninfected following wnv exposure , or  unexposed.


RESULTS
in contrast to our previous findings with a relatively resistant cx. tarsalis colony, wnv infection did not alter fecundity or blood-feeding behaviour of cx. pipiens, yet results do indicate that resistance to infection is associated with a fitness cost in terms of mosquito survival.


CONCLUSIONS
the identification of species-specific differences provides an evolutionary explanation for variability in vector susceptibility to arboviruses and suggests that understanding the costs of infection and resistance are important factors in determining the potential competence of vector populations for arboviruses.
