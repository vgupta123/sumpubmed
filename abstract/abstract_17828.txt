BACKGROUND
metagenomics is a rapidly growing field of research aimed at studying assemblages of uncultured organisms using various sequencing technologies, with the hope of understanding the true diversity of microbes, their functions, cooperation and evolution. there are two main approaches to metagenomics: amplicon sequencing, which involves pcr-targeted sequencing of a specific locus, often 16s rrna, and random shotgun sequencing. several tools or packages have been developed for analyzing communities using 16s rrna sequences. similarly, a number of tools exist for analyzing randomly sequenced dna reads.


RESULTS
we describe an extension of the metagenome analysis tool megan, which allows one to analyze 16s sequences. for the analysis all 16s sequences are blasted against the silva database. the result output is imported into megan, using a synonym file that maps the silva accession numbers onto the ncbi taxonomy.


CONCLUSIONS
environmental samples are often studied using both targeted 16s rrna sequencing and random shotgun sequencing. hence tools are needed that allow one to analyze both types of data together, and one such tool is megan. the ideas presented in this paper are implemented in megan  <dig>  which is available from: http://www-ab.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/software/megan.
