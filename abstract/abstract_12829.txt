BACKGROUND
poly polymerase- <dig>  is a nuclear enzyme that plays critical functions in many biological processes, including dna repair and gene transcription. the main function of parp- <dig> is to catalyze the transfer of adp-ribose units from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide  to a large array of acceptor proteins, which comprises histones, transcription factors, as well as parp- <dig> itself. we have previously demonstrated that transcription of the parp- <dig> gene essentially rely on the opposite regulatory actions of two distinct transcription factors, sp <dig> and nfi. in the present study, we examined whether suppression of parp- <dig> expression in embryonic fibroblasts derived from parp- <dig> knockout mice  might alter the expression and/or dna binding properties of sp <dig> and nfi. we also explored the possibility that sp <dig> or nfi  may represent target proteins of parp- <dig> activity.


RESULTS
expression of both sp <dig> and nfi was found to be considerably reduced in parp-1-/- cells. co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that parp- <dig> physically interacts with sp <dig> in a dna-independent manner, but neither with sp <dig> nor nfi, in parp-1+/+ cells. in addition, in vitro parp assays indicated that parp- <dig> could catalyze the addition of polymer of adp-ribose to sp <dig>  which also translated into a reduction of sp <dig> binding to its consensus dna target site. transfection of the parp- <dig> promoter into both parp-1+/+ and parp-1-/- cells revealed that the lack of parp- <dig> expression in parp-1-/- cells also results in a strong increase in parp- <dig> promoter activity. this influence of parp- <dig> was found to rely on the presence of the sp <dig> sites present on the basal parp- <dig> promoter as their mutation entirely abolished the increased promoter activity observed in parp-1-/- cells. subjecting parp-1+/+ cells to an oxidative challenge with hydrogen peroxide to increase parp- <dig> activity translated into a dramatic reduction in the dna binding properties of sp <dig>  however, its suppression by the inhibitor pj <dig> improved dna binding of sp <dig> and led to a dramatic increase in parp- <dig> promoter function.


CONCLUSIONS
our results therefore recognized sp <dig> as a target protein of parp- <dig> activity, the addition of polymer of adp-ribose to this transcription factor restricting its positive regulatory influence on gene transcription.
