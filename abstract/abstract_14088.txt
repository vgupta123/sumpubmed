BACKGROUND
some pseudomonas strains function as predominant plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria . within this group, pseudomonas chlororaphis and pseudomonas fluorescens are non-pathogenic biocontrol agents, and some pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas stutzeri strains are pgpr. p. chlororaphis gp <dig> is a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium with a fully sequenced genome. we conducted a genomic analysis comparing gp <dig> with three other pseudomonad pgpr: p. fluorescens pf- <dig>  p. aeruginosa m <dig>  and the nitrogen-fixing strain p. stutzeri a <dig>  our aim was to identify the similarities and differences among these strains using a comparative genomic approach to clarify the mechanisms of plant growth-promoting activity.


RESULTS
the genome sizes of gp <dig>  pf- <dig>  m <dig>  and a <dig> ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  m, and the number of protein-coding genes varied among the four species. clusters of orthologous groups  analysis assigned functions to predicted proteins. the cogs distributions were similar among the four species. however, the percentage of genes encoding transposases and their inactivated derivatives  was  <dig> % of the total genes with cogs classifications in a <dig>   <dig> % in gp <dig>   <dig> % in pf- <dig>  and  <dig> % in m <dig>  a phylogenetic analysis indicated that gp <dig> and pf- <dig> were the most closely related strains, consistent with the genome alignment results. comparisons of predicted coding sequences  between gp <dig> and pf- <dig> revealed  <dig> conserved genes. there were fewer conserved genes when gp <dig> cdss were compared with those of a <dig> and m <dig>  comparisons among the four pseudomonas species revealed  <dig> conserved genes in gp <dig>  illustrating common plant growth-promoting traits shared among these pgpr. conserved genes were related to catabolism, transport of plant-derived compounds, stress resistance, and rhizosphere colonization. some strain-specific cdss were related to different kinds of biocontrol activities or plant growth promotion. the gp <dig> genome contained the cus operon  and a gene cluster involved in type iv pilus biosynthesis, which confers adhesion ability.


CONCLUSIONS
comparative genomic analysis of four representative pgpr revealed some conserved regions, indicating common characteristics  among these pseudomonad pgpr. genomic regions specific to each strain provide clues to its lifestyle, ecological adaptation, and physiological role in the rhizosphere.
