BACKGROUND
homology inference is pivotal to evolutionary biology and is primarily based on significant sequence similarity, which, in general, is a good indicator of homology. algorithms have also been designed to utilize conservation in gene order as an indication of homologous regions. we have developed genfamclust, a method based on quantification of both gene order conservation and sequence similarity.


RESULTS
in this study, we validate genfamclust by comparing it to well known homology inference algorithms on a synthetic dataset. we applied several popular clustering algorithms on homologs inferred by genfamclust and other algorithms on a metazoan dataset and studied the outcomes. accuracy, similarity, dependence, and other characteristics were investigated for gene families yielded by the clustering algorithms. genfamclust was also applied to genes from a set of complete fungal genomes and gene families were inferred using clustering. the resulting gene families were compared with a manually curated gold standard of pillars from the yeast gene order browser. we found that the gene-order component of genfamclust is simple, yet biologically realistic, and captures local synteny information for homologs.


CONCLUSIONS
the study shows that genfamclust is a more accurate, informed, and comprehensive pipeline to infer homologs and gene families than other commonly used homology and gene-family inference methods.
