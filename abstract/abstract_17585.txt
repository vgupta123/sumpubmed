BACKGROUND
the p <dig> pathway is differentially activated in response to distinct dna damage, leading to alternative phenotypic outcomes in mammalian cells. recent evidence suggests that p <dig> expression dynamics play an important role in the differential regulation of cell fate, but questions remain as to how p <dig> dynamics and the subsequent cellular response are modulated by variable dna damage.


RESULTS
we identified a novel, bimodal switch of p <dig> dynamics modulated by dna-damage strength that is crucial for cell-fate control. after low dna damage, p <dig> underwent periodic pulsing and cells entered cell-cycle arrest. after high dna damage, p <dig> underwent a strong monotonic increase and cells activated apoptosis. we found that the damage dose-dependent bimodal switch was due to differential mdm <dig> upregulation, which controlled the alternative cell fates mainly by modulating the induction level and pro-apoptotic activities of p <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our findings not only uncover a new mode of regulation for p <dig> dynamics and cell fate, but also suggest that p <dig> oscillation may function as a suppressor, maintaining a low level of p <dig> induction and pro-apoptotic activities so as to render cell-cycle arrest that allows damage repair.
