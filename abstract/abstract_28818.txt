BACKGROUND
fungal “versatile carboxylic ester hydrolases” are enzymes with great biotechnological interest. here we carried out a bioinformatic screening to find these proteins in genomes from agaricales, by means of searching for conserved motifs, sequence and phylogenetic analysis, and three-dimensional modeling. moreover, we reconstructed the molecular evolution of these enzymes along the time by inferring and analyzing the sequence of ancestral intermediate forms.


RESULTS
the properties of the ancestral candidates are discussed on the basis of their three-dimensional structural models, the hydrophobicity of the lid, and the substrate binding intramolecular tunnel, revealing all of them featured properties of these enzymes. the evolutionary history of the putative lipases revealed an increase on the length and hydrophobicity of the lid region, as well as in the size of the substrate binding pocket, during evolution time. these facts suggest the enzymes’ specialization towards certain substrates and their subsequent loss of promiscuity.


CONCLUSIONS
these results bring to light the presence of different pools of lipases in fungi with different habitats and life styles. despite the consistency of the data gathered from reconstruction of ancestral sequences, the heterologous expression of some of these candidates would be essential to corroborate enzymes’ activities.
