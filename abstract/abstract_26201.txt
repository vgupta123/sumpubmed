BACKGROUND
human insulin-like growth factor-i  is a growth factor which is highly resemble to insulin. it is essential for cell proliferation and has been proposed for treatment of various endocrine-associated diseases including growth hormone insensitivity syndrome and diabetes mellitus. in the present study, an efficient plant expression system was developed to produce biologically active recombinant higf-i  in transgenic rice grains.


RESULTS
the plant-codon-optimized higf-i was introduced into rice via agrobacterium-mediated transformation. to enhance the stability and yield of rhigf-i, the endoplasmic reticulum-retention signal and glutelin signal peptide were used to deliver rhigf-i to endoplasmic reticulum for stable accumulation. we found that only glutelin signal peptide could lead to successful expression of higf-i  and one gram of higf-i  rice grain possessed the maximum activity level equivalent to  <dig>  micro molar of commercial rhigf-i. in vitro functional analysis showed that the rice-derived rhigf-i was effective in inducing membrane ruffling and glucose uptake on rat skeletal muscle cells. oral meal test with rice-containing rhigf-i acutely reduced blood glucose levels in streptozotocin-induced and zucker diabetic rats, whereas it had no effect in normal rats.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings provided an alternative expression system to produce large quantities of biologically active rhigf-i. the provision of large quantity of recombinant proteins will promote further research on the therapeutic potential of rhigf-i.
