BACKGROUND
the mechanisms and components that regulate macropinocytosis are poorly understood. here we have investigated the role of sorting nexin  <dig>  in the regulation of macropinocytic activity.


RESULTS
snx <dig> is abundantly expressed in macrophages, cells very active in macropinocytosis, and is recruited onto newly-formed macropinosomes. lps treatment of bone marrow-derived macrophages resulted in a  <dig>  fold decrease in macropinosome formation that correlates with a reduction in the levels of snx <dig>  to investigate the relationship between snx <dig> levels and macropinocytic activity we examined the formation of macropinosomes in hek-flpin cells stably expressing gfp-snx <dig>  constitutive macropinocytosis was increased ~ <dig> fold in hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells compared with parental hek-flpin cells. furthermore, egf stimulation resulted in a significant increase in macropinocytosis and there was also a  <dig>  fold increase in the generation of macropinosomes in hek-gfp-snx <dig> cells compared with parental hek-flpin cells. snx <dig>  which interacts specifically with ptdinsp and ptdinsp <dig> through its px domain, was recruited to regions on the plasma membrane containing egf receptor or positive for ptdinsp <dig> as detected with the ph domain of tapp <dig>  treatment with ag <dig>  an egf receptor specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, prevented the recruitment of snx <dig> to the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane and inhibited the formation of macropinosomes in response to egf treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
based on these data, we propose that snx <dig> requires the generation of phosphoinositides for recruitment to the plasma membrane and, moreover, influences the level of macropinocytic activity.
