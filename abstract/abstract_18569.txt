BACKGROUND
hedgehog  signaling from the urogenital sinus  epithelium to the surrounding mesenchyme plays a critical role in regulating ductal formation and growth during prostate development. the primary cilium, a feature of most interphase vertebrate cell types, serves as a required localization domain for hh signaling transducing proteins.


RESULTS
immunostaining revealed the presence of primary cilia in mesenchymal cells of the developing prostate. cell-based assays of a urongenital sinus mesenchymal cell line  revealed that proliferation-limiting  growth conditions promoted cilia formation and correlated with pathway activation associated with accumulation of smoothened in primary cilia. the prostate cancer cell lines pc- <dig>  lncap, and 22rv <dig>  previously shown to lack demonstrable autocrine hh signaling capacity, did not exhibit primary cilia even under proliferation-limiting growth conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that paracrine hedgehog signaling activity in the prostate is associated with the presence of primary cilia on stromal cells but that a role in autocrine hh signaling remains speculative.
