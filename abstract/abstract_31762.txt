BACKGROUND
the characterization of the global functional structure of a cell is a major goal in bioinformatics and systems biology. gene ontology  and the protein-protein interaction network offer alternative views of that structure.


RESULTS
this study presents a comparison of the global structures of the gene ontology and the interactome of saccharomyces cerevisiae. sensitive, unsupervised methods of clustering applied to a large fraction of the proteome led to establish a go-interactome correlation value of + <dig>  for a general dataset that contains both high and low-confidence interactions and + <dig>  for a smaller, high-confidence dataset.


CONCLUSIONS
the structures of the yeast cell deduced from go and interactome are substantially congruent. however, some significant differences were also detected, which may contribute to a better understanding of cell function and also to a refinement of the current ontologies.
