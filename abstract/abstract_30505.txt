BACKGROUND
the mammalian sperm-associated antigen  <dig> gene  uses alternative promoters to produce two major transcript isoforms  and encode proteins that are involved in the cilia/flagella formation and motility. in silico analysis of both mouse and human spag16l promoters reveals the existence of multiple putative sox <dig> binding sites. given that the sox <dig> gene encodes a 48-kda transcription factor  and the presence of putative sox <dig> binding sites at the spag16l promoter, regulation of spag16l expression by s-sox <dig> was studied in the present work.


RESULTS
s-sox <dig> activated human spag16l promoter activity in the human bronchial epithelia cell line beas-2b cells. mutation of s-sox <dig> binding sites abolished the stimulatory effect. overexpression of s-sox <dig> resulted in a significant increase in the abundance of spag16l transcripts whereas silencing of s-sox <dig> by rnai largely reduced the spag16l expression. chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that s-sox <dig> directly interacts with the spag16l promoter.


CONCLUSIONS
s-sox <dig> regulates transcription of human spag16l gene via directly binding to the promoter of spag16l. it has been reported that expression of sperm-associated antigen  <dig> , encoding another axonemal protein, is activated by s-sox <dig>  therefore, s-sox <dig> may regulate formation of motile cilia/flagella through globally mediating expression of genes encoding axonemal proteins.
