BACKGROUND
the diversity in eukaryotic life reflects a diversity in regulatory pathways. nocedal and johnson argue that the rewiring of gene regulatory networks is a major force for the diversity of life, that changes in regulation can create new species.


RESULTS
we have created a method  for detecting more complicated rewirings, where several transcription factors can substitute for one or more transcription factors in the regulation of a family of co-regulated genes. an example is illustrative. a rewiring has been reported by hogues et al. that rap <dig> in saccharomyces cerevisiae substitutes for tbf1/cbf <dig> in candida albicans for ribosomal rp genes. there one transcription factor substitutes for another on some collection of genes. such a substitution is referred to as a “rewiring”. we agree with this finding of rewiring as far as it goes but the situation is more complicated. many transcription factors can regulate a gene and our algorithm finds that in this example a “team”  of three transcription factors including rap <dig> substitutes for tbf <dig> for  <dig> genes. the switch occurs for a branch of the phylogenetic tree containing  <dig> species , while the remaining  <dig> species  are regulated by tbf <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
to gain insight into more general evolutionary mechanisms, we have created a mathematical algorithm that finds such general switching events and we prove that it converges. of course any such computational discovery should be validated in the biological tests. for each branch of the phylogenetic tree and each gene module, our algorithm finds a sub-group of co-regulated genes and a team of transcription factors that substitutes for another team of transcription factors. in most cases the signal will be small but in some cases we find a strong signal of switching. we report our findings for  <dig> ascomycota fungi species.
