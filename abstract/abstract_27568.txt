BACKGROUND
dna polymerase ε  is involved in dna replication, repair, and cell-cycle checkpoint control in eukaryotic cells. although the roles of replicative pol α and pol δ in chromosomal dna replication are relatively well understood and well documented, the precise role of pol ε in chromosomal dna replication is not well understood.


RESULTS
this study uses a xenopus egg extract dna replication system to further elucidate the replicative role played by pol ε. previous studies show that the initiation timing and elongation of chromosomal dna replication are markedly impaired in pol ε-depleted xenopus egg extracts, with reduced accumulation of replicative intermediates and products. this study shows that normal replication is restored by addition of pol ε holoenzyme to pol ε-depleted extracts, but not by addition of polymerase-deficient forms of pol ε, including polymerase point or deletion mutants or incomplete enzyme complexes. evidence is also provided that pol ε holoenzyme interacts directly with gins, cdc45p and cut5p, each of which plays an important role in initiation of chromosomal dna replication in eukaryotic cells.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that the dna polymerase activity of pol ε holoenzyme plays an essential role in normal chromosomal dna replication in xenopus egg extracts. these are the first biochemical data to show the dna polymerase activity of pol ε holoenzyme is essential for chromosomal dna replication in higher eukaryotes, unlike in yeasts.
