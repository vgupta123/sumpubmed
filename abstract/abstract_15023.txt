BACKGROUND
in escherichia coli the genes involved in the acquisition of tetracycline resistance are mainly tet and tet. in addition, tet is the most common tetracycline resistance determinant in enterococci and it is associated with conjugative transposons and plasmids. although tet has been identified in e. coli, to our knowledge, there are no previous reports studying the linkage of the tet gene in e. coli to different mobile genetic elements. the aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of tet, tet, and tet genes in doxycycline-resistant e. coli isolates from pigs, as well as the detection of mobile genetic elements linked to tet in e. coli and its possible transfer from enterococci.


RESULTS
tet was the most frequently detected gene  in doxycycline-resistant isolates. tet was found in  <dig> % e. coli isolates. the tet gene was detected in relation with conjugative transposons in  <dig> out of  <dig> enterococci isolates analyzed but not in any of e. coli isolates positive for tet. southern blot showed that in e. coli and in most of the enterococci isolates the tet gene was carried on a plasmid. according to the phylogenetic analysis, e. coli contained a new tet allele grouping separately. mating experiments revealed that tet was carried on a mobile element successfully transferred between enterococci and between enterococci and e. coli.


CONCLUSIONS
the detection of tet in e. coli isolates from pigs was higher than expected. in our study, tet detected in e. coli seems not to have been transferred from enterococci, although it can not be ruled out that the horizontal transfer of this gene occurred from other intestinal tract bacteria.
