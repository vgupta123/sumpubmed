BACKGROUND
human leukocyte antigen -b <dig> is strongly associated with the development of reactive arthritis  in humans after salmonellosis. human monocytic u <dig> cells transfected with hla-b <dig> are less able to eliminate intracellular salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis than those transfected with control hla antigens . to investigate further the mechanisms by which hla-b27-transfected cells allow increased replication of these bacteria, a dna-based microarray was used for comparative genomic analysis of s. enteritidis grown in hla-b27- or hla-a2-transfected cells. the microarray consisted of  <dig> oligonucleotides from different serovars of salmonella including s. enteritidis pt4-specific genes. bacterial rna was isolated from the infected hla-b27- or hla-a2-transfected cells, reverse-transcribed to cdna, and hybridized with the oligonucleotides on the microarrays. some microarray results were confirmed by rt-pcr.


RESULTS
when gene expression was compared between salmonella grown in hla-b <dig> cells and in hla-a <dig> cells,  <dig> of the  <dig> s. enteritidis-related genes differed in expression at  <dig> h after infection, but no significant difference was detectable at  <dig> h after infection. these differentially expressed genes are mainly involved in salmonella virulence, dna replication, energy conversion and metabolism, and uptake and metabolism of nutrient substances, etc. the difference suggests hla-b27-dependent modulation of salmonella gene expression, resulting in increased salmonella replication in hla-b27-positive cells. among the up-regulated genes were those located in salmonella pathogenicity island - <dig>  which play a central role in intracellular survival and replication of salmonella.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report to show the regulation of salmonella gene expression by hla-b <dig> during infection of host cells. this regulation probably leads to increased salmonella survival and replication in hla-b27-positive cells. spi- <dig> genes seem to contribute significantly to the increased replication.
