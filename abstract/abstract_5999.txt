BACKGROUND
valuable insights into the complex process of retinal vascular development can be gained using models with abnormal retinal vasculature. two such models are the recently described mouse lines with mutations in lama <dig>  an important component of the retinal internal limiting membrane . these mutants have a persistence of the fetal vasculature of vitreous  but lack a primary retinal vascular plexus. the present study provides a detailed analysis of astrocyte and vascular development in these lama <dig> mutants.


RESULTS
although astrocytes and blood vessels initially migrate into lama <dig> mutant retinas, both traverse the peripapillary ilm into the vitreous by p <dig>  once in the vitreous, blood vessels anastomose with vessels of the vasa hyaloidea propria, part of the fvv, and eventually re-enter the retina where they dive to form the inner and outer retinal capillary networks. astrocytes continue proliferating within the vitreous to form a dense mesh that resembles epiretinal membranes associated with persistent fetal vasculature and proliferative vitreoretinopathy.


CONCLUSIONS
lama <dig> and a fully intact ilm are required for normal retinal vascular development. mutations in lama <dig> allow developing retinal vessels to enter the vitreous where they anastomose with vessels of the hyaloid system which persist and expand. together, these vessels branch into the retina to form fairly normal inner retinal vascular capillary plexi. the lama <dig> mutants described in this report are potential models for studying the human conditions persistent fetal vasculature and proliferative vitreoretinopathy.
