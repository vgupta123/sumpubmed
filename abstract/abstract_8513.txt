BACKGROUND
tead <dig>  is constitutively expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles. it acts as a key molecule of muscle development, and trans-activates multiple target genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation pathways. however, its target genes in skeletal muscles, regulatory mechanisms and networks are unknown.


RESULTS
in this paper, we have identified  <dig> target genes regulated directly by tead <dig> in skeletal muscle using integrated analyses of chip-on-chip. most of the targets take part in the cell process, physiology process, biological regulation metabolism and development process. the targets also play an important role in mapk, mtor, t cell receptor, jak-stat, calcineurin and insulin signaling pathways. tead <dig> regulates foxo3a transcription through binding to the m-cat element in foxo3a promoter, demonstrated with independent chip-pcr, emsa and luciferase reporter system assay. in addition, results of over-expression and inhibition experiments suggest that foxo3a is positively regulated by tead <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our present data suggests that tead <dig> plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression and different signaling pathways may co-operate with each other mediated by tead <dig>  we have preliminarily concluded that tead <dig> may regulate foxo3a expression through calcineurin/mef2/nfat and igf-1/pi3k/akt signaling pathways in skeletal muscles. these findings provide important clues for further analysis of the role of foxo3a gene in the formation and transformation of skeletal muscle fiber types.
