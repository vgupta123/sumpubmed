BACKGROUND
it has been proposed that sildenafil citrate can increase ocular blood flow, and that this property can be used to treat ocular disorders that involve reflex vasoconstriction. this study therefore proposes to ascertain the vasodilator effect of the drug on retrobulbar circulation in healthy rabbits. for this matter rabbits treated with sildenafil citrate or saline solution had their intraocular pressure , mean arterial pressure , ocular perfusion pressure  and color doppler imaging of the external ophthalmic artery measured prior to treatment and on days one , seven , fourteen , twenty-one , and thirty  of treatment.


RESULTS
the map and opp values of treated group were lower than those of control group at all times, and the mean values differed statistically at moments m <dig>  and m <dig> . the iop and color doppler values of the external ophthalmic artery did not differ between tested groups.


CONCLUSIONS
the dose of 10 mg of sildenafil citrate administered to healthy rabbits causes systemic vasodilation and consequently lower values of map and opp. however, it does not induce changes in iop and retrobulbar hemodynamics identifiable by color doppler assessment of the external ophthalmic artery.
