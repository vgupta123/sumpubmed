BACKGROUND
plants have evolved an array of constitutive and inducible defense strategies to restrict pathogen ingress. however, some pathogens still manage to invade plants and impair growth and productivity. previous studies have revealed several key regulators of defense responses, and efforts have been made to use this information to develop disease resistant crop plants. these efforts are often hampered by the complexity of defense signaling pathways. to further elucidate the complexity of defense responses, we screened a population of t-dna mutants in colombia- <dig> background that displayed altered defense responses to virulent pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig> .


RESULTS
in this study, we demonstrated that the arabidopsis purple acid phosphatse <dig>  gene, induced under prolonged phosphate  starvation, is required for maintaining basal resistance to certain pathogens. the expression of pap <dig> was distinctly induced only under prolonged pi starvation and during the early stage of pst dc <dig> infection . t-dna tagged mutant pap <dig> displayed enhanced susceptibility to the virulent bacterial pathogen pst dc <dig>  the pap <dig> mutation greatly reduced the expression of pathogen inducible gene pr <dig> compared to wild-type plants. similarly, other defense related genes including ics <dig> and pdf <dig>  were impaired in pap <dig> plants. moreover, application of bth  restored pr <dig> expression in pap <dig> plants.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our results demonstrate the requirement of pap <dig> for maintaining basal resistance against pst dc <dig>  furthermore, our results provide evidence that pap <dig> acts upstream of sa accumulation to regulate the expression of other defense responsive genes. we also provide the first experimental evidence indicating the role pap <dig> in plant defense responses.
