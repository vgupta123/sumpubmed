BACKGROUND
in xenopus the bone morphogenetic protein growth and differentiation factor  <dig>  is expressed at the edge of the neural plate, and within the anterior neural plate including the eye fields. here we address the role of gdf <dig> in neural and eye development by morpholino knockdown experiments.


RESULTS
we show that depletion of gdf <dig>  resulted in a reduction in eye size, loss of laminar structure and a reduction in differentiated neural cell types within the retina. this correlated with a reduction in staining for smad1/5/ <dig> phosphorylation indicating a decrease in gdf <dig> signalling through loss of phosphorylation of these intracellular mediators of bone morphogenetic protein  signalling. in addition, the pax <dig> expression domain is reduced in size at early optic vesicle stages. neural cell adhesion molecule  is generally reduced in intensity along the neural tube, while in the retina and brain discreet patches of ncam expression are also lost. gdf <dig> knock down resulted in an increase in cell death along the neural tube and within the retina as determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp nick end labeling  staining.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate that gdf <dig> has an important role in neural differentiation in the eye as well as within the central nervous system, and that gdf <dig> may act in some way to maintain cell survival within the ectoderm, during the normal waves of programmed cell death.
