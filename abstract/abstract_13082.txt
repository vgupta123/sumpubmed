BACKGROUND
johne's disease, a serious chronic form of enteritis in ruminants, is caused by mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis . as the organism is very slow-growing and fastidious, several pcr-based methods for detection have been developed, based mainly on the map-specific gene is <dig>  however, because this gene is similar to genes in other mycobacteria, there is a need for sensitive and reliable methods to confirm the presence of map. as described here, two new real-time pcr systems on the is <dig> gene and one on the f <dig> gene were developed and carefully validated on  <dig> strains and  <dig> positive clinical faecal samples.


RESULTS
our confirmatory pcr systems on is <dig> were found sensitive and specific, only yielding weak false positive reactions in one strain for each system. the pcr system on f <dig> did not elicit any false positives and was only slightly less sensitive than our primary is900-system. dna from both naturally infected and spiked faeces that tested positive with our primary system could be confirmed with all new systems, except one low-level infected sample that tested negative with the f <dig> system.


CONCLUSIONS
we recommend using the newly constructed dh <dig> pcr system on the f <dig> gene as the primary confirmatory test for pcr positives, but should it fail due to its lower sensitivity, the dh <dig> and dh <dig> pcr systems should be used.
