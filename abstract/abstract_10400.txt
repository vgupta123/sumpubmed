BACKGROUND
current studies report that aberrations in epigenetic regulators or chromatin modifications are related to tumor development and maintenance. ezh <dig>  is one of the catalytic subunits of polycomb repressive complex  <dig>  a crucial epigenetic regulator. ezh <dig> has a master regulatory function in such processes as cell proliferation, stem cell differentiation, and early embryogenesis. in humans, ezh <dig> is linked to oncogenic function in several carcinomas, including breast cancer, and dysregulation of ezh <dig> has been particularly associated with loss of differentiation and the development of poorly differentiated breast cancer. in our present study, we were interested in determining whether ezh <dig> is increased in canine mammary tumors, which show similarities to human breast cancer.


RESULTS
investigation of the expression of ezh <dig> in canine mammary tumors revealed that ezh <dig> protein was overexpressed in canine mammary carcinomas, as in human breast cancer. in addition, the immunohistochemical expression level of ezh <dig> was associated with the degree of malignancy in canine mammary carcinoma. this is the first report to describe ezh <dig> expression in canine mammary tumors.


CONCLUSIONS
because the expression of ezh <dig> was similar in canine mammary carcinoma and human breast cancer, spontaneous canine mammary tumors may be a suitable model for studying ezh <dig> and treatment development.
