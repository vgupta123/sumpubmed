BACKGROUND
mouse and rat models are mainstays in pharmacology, toxicology and drug development â€“ but differences between strains and between species complicate data interpretation and application to human health. dioxin-like polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons represent a major class of environmentally and economically relevant toxicants. in mammals dioxin exposure leads to a broad spectrum of adverse affects, including hepatotoxicity of varying severity. several studies have shown that dioxins extensively alter hepatic mrna levels. surprisingly, though, analysis of a limited portion of the transcriptome revealed that rat and mouse responses diverge greatly .


RESULTS
we employed oligonucleotide arrays to compare the response of  <dig>  rat and mouse orthologs. we confirmed that there is limited inter-species overlap in dioxin-responsive genes. rat-specific and mouse-specific genes are enriched for specific functional groups which differ between species, conceivably accounting for species-specificities in liver histopathology. while no evidence for the involvement of copy-number variation was found, extensive inter-species variation in the transcriptional-regulatory network was identified; nr2f <dig> and fos emerged as candidates to explain species-specific and species-independent responses, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that a small core of genes is responsible for mediating the similar features of dioxin hepatotoxicity in rats and mice but non-overlapping pathways are simultaneously at play to result in distinctive histopathological outcomes. the extreme divergence between mouse and rat transcriptomic responses appears to reflect divergent transcriptional-regulatory networks. taken together, these data suggest that both rat and mouse models should be used to screen the acute hepatotoxic effects of drugs and toxic compounds.
