BACKGROUND
the aims of this study were to compare the pharmacokinetics of albendazole sulfoxide  in goats and sheep at a dose of 5 mg/kg bodyweight , after intravenous  and subcutaneous  administrations, and to investigate the effects of increased doses  on the plasma disposition of abz-so in goats following sc administration. a total of  <dig> goats  and  <dig> sheep  12– <dig> months old and weighing 20–32 kg, were used. the study was designed according to two-phase crossover study protocol. in phase- <dig>  eight sheep were assigned as group i and  <dig> goats were allocated into two groups . abz-so was applied to group i  and group ii  animals subcutaneously, and to group iii  animals intravenously, all at a dose rate of 5 mg/kg bw. in phase- <dig>  the sheep in the group i received abz-so intravenously in a dose of 5 mg/kg bw; the goats in group ii and group iii received abz-so subcutaneously at a dose of 10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg bw, respectively. blood samples were collected from the jugular vein at different times between  <dig> and 120 h after drug administrations. the plasma concentrations of abz-so and its metabolites were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography.


RESULTS
in goats, the area under the curve, terminal half-life and plasma persistence of abz-so were significantly smaller and shorter, respectively, compared with those observed in sheep following both iv and sc administrations at a dose of 5 mg/kg bw. on the other side, dose-dependent plasma dispositions of abz-so were observed following sc administration at increased doses  in goats.


CONCLUSIONS
consequently, abz-so might be used at higher doses to provide higher plasma concentration and thus to achieve greater efficacy against the target parasites.
