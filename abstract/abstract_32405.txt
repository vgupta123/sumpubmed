BACKGROUND
transcriptional enhancers are generally known to regulate gene transcription from afar. their activation involves a series of changes in chromatin marks and recruitment of protein factors. these enhancers may also occur inside genes, but how many may be active in human cells and their effects on the regulation of the host gene remains unclear.


RESULTS
we describe a novel semi-supervised method based on the relative enrichment of chromatin signals between  <dig> conditions to predict active enhancers. we applied this method to the tumoral k <dig> and the normal gm <dig> cell lines to predict enhancers that are differentially active in one cell type. these predictions show enhancer-like properties according to positional distribution, correlation with gene expression and production of enhancer rnas. using this model, we predict  <dig>  and  <dig> intragenic active enhancers in k <dig> and gm <dig>  respectively, and relate the differential activation of these enhancers to expression and splicing differences of the host genes.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that the activation or silencing of intragenic transcriptional enhancers modulate the regulation of the host gene by means of a local change of the chromatin and the recruitment of enhancer-related factors that may interact with the rna directly or through the interaction with rna binding proteins. predicted enhancers are available at http://regulatorygenomics.upf.edu/projects/enhancers.html.
