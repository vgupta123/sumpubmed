BACKGROUND
the out of africa hypothesis has gained generalized consensus. however, many specific questions remain unsettled. to know whether the two m and n macrohaplogroups that colonized eurasia were already present in africa before the exit is puzzling. it has been proposed that the east african clade m <dig> supports a single origin of haplogroup m in africa. to test the validity of that hypothesis, the phylogeographic analysis of  <dig> complete mitochondrial dna  sequences and  <dig> partial sequences belonging to haplogroup m <dig> was carried out.


RESULTS
the coalescence age of the african haplogroup m <dig> is younger than those for other m asiatic clades. in contradiction to the hypothesis of an eastern africa origin for modern human expansions out of africa, the most ancestral m <dig> lineages have been found in northwest africa and in the near east, instead of in east africa. the m <dig> geographic distribution and the relative ages of its different subclades clearly correlate with those of haplogroup u <dig>  for which an eurasian ancestor has been demonstrated.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides evidence that m <dig>  or its ancestor, had an asiatic origin. the earliest m <dig> expansion into africa occurred in northwestern instead of eastern areas; this early spread reached the iberian peninsula even affecting the basques. the majority of the m1a lineages found outside and inside africa had a more recent eastern africa origin. both western and eastern m <dig> lineages participated in the neolithic colonization of the sahara. the striking parallelism between subclade ages and geographic distribution of m <dig> and its north african u <dig> counterpart strongly reinforces this scenario. finally, a relevant fraction of m1a lineages present today in the european continent and nearby islands possibly had a jewish instead of the commonly proposed arab/berber maternal ascendance.
