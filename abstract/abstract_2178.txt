BACKGROUND
bacterial infection of the urinary tract is a common clinical problem with e. coli being the most common urinary pathogen. bacterial uptake into epithelial cells is increasingly recognised as an important feature of infection. bacterial virulence factors, especially fimbrial adhesins, have been conclusively shown to promote host cell invasion. our recent study reported that c <dig> opsonisation markedly increases the ability of e. coli strain j <dig> to internalise into human proximal tubular epithelial cells via cd <dig>  a complement regulatory protein expressed on host cell membrane. in this study, we further assessed whether c3-dependent internalisation by human tubular epithelial cells is a general feature of uropathogenic e. coli and investigated features of the bacterial phenotype that may account for any heterogeneity.


RESULTS
in  <dig> clinical isolates of e. coli tested, c3-dependent internalisation was evident in  <dig> isolates. type  <dig> fimbriae mediated-binding is essential for c3-dependent internalisation as shown by phenotypic association, type  <dig> fimbrial blockade with soluble ligand  and by assessment of a type  <dig> fimbrial mutant.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that efficient internalisation of uropathogenic e. coli by the human urinary tract depends on co-operation between type  <dig> fimbriae-mediated adhesion and c <dig> receptor -ligand interaction.
