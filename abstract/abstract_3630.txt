BACKGROUND
arsenic is toxic to most living cells. the two soluble inorganic forms of arsenic are arsenite  and arsenate , with arsenite the more toxic. prokaryotic metabolism of arsenic has been reported in both thermal and moderate environments and has been shown to be involved in the redox cycling of arsenic. no arsenic metabolism  has ever been reported in cold environments .


RESULTS
our study site is located  <dig> kilometres south of the arctic circle in the northwest territories, canada in an inactive gold mine which contains mine waste water in excess of  <dig> mm arsenic. several thousand tonnes of arsenic trioxide dust are stored in underground chambers and microbial biofilms grow on the chamber walls below seepage points rich in arsenite-containing solutions. we compared the arsenite oxidisers in two subsamples  collected from one biofilm. 'species'  richness did not differ between subsamples, but the relative importance of the three identifiable clades did. an arsenite-oxidising bacterium  was isolated, and was shown to oxidise arsenite in the early exponential growth phase and to grow at a broad range of temperatures . its arsenite oxidase was constitutively expressed and functioned over a broad temperature range.


CONCLUSIONS
the diversity of arsenite oxidisers does not significantly differ from two subsamples of a microbial biofilm that vary in arsenite concentrations. gm <dig> is the first psychrotolerant arsenite oxidiser to be isolated with the ability to grow below 10Â°c. this ability to grow at low temperatures could be harnessed for arsenic bioremediation in moderate to cold climates.
