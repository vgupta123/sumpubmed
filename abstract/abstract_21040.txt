BACKGROUND
experiments from a range of ecosystems have shown that insectivorous birds are important in controlling the populations of their invertebrate prey. here, we report on a large field experiment testing the hypothesis that management for enhancing recreational values in suburban woodlands affects the intensity of bird predation on canopy-living arthropods. bird exclosures were used in two types of management  at two foraging heights in oak quercus robur canopies and the experiment was replicated at two sites.


RESULTS
the biomass and abundance of arthropods were high on net-enclosed branches but strongly reduced on control branches in both types of management. in woods with dense understory, the effect of bird predation on arthropod abundance was about twice as high as in woods with understory clearance. the effect of bird predation on arthropod biomass was not significantly affected by management.


CONCLUSIONS
our data provide experimental evidence to support the idea that bird predation on arthropods can be affected by forest management. we suggest that the mechanism is twofold: reduction of bird abundance and shift of foraging behaviour. in urban woodlands, there may be a management trade-off between enhancing recreational values and promoting bird predation rates on arthropods.
