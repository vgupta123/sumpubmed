BACKGROUND
marine phytoplankton are responsible for 50% of the co <dig> that is fixed annually worldwide and contribute massively to other biogeochemical cycles in the oceans. diatoms and coccolithophores play a significant role as the base of the marine food web and they sequester carbon due to their ability to form blooms and to biomineralise. to discover the presence and regulation of short non-coding rnas  in these two important phytoplankton groups, we sequenced short rna transcriptomes of two diatom species  and validated them by northern blots along with the coccolithophore emiliania huxleyi.


RESULTS
despite an exhaustive search, we did not find canonical mirnas in diatoms. the most prominent classes of srnas in diatoms were repeat-associated srnas and trna-derived srnas. the latter were also present in e. huxleyi. trna-derived srnas in diatoms were induced under important environmental stress conditions , and they were very abundant especially in the polar diatom f. cylindrus  even under optimal growth conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides first experimental evidence for the existence of short non-coding rnas in marine microalgae. our data suggest that canonical mirnas are absent from diatoms. however, the group of trna-derived srnas seems to be very prominent in diatoms and coccolithophores and maybe used for acclimation to environmental conditions.
