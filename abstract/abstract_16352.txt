BACKGROUND
hepatocellular carcinoma  in young subjects is rare but more devastating. we hypothesize that genes and etiological pathways are unique to young hcc  patients. we therefore compared the gene expression profiles between yhccs and hccs from elderly patients.


RESULTS
all  <dig> young hccs  were positive for serum hepatitis b surface antigen , but negative for antibodies to hepatitis c virus . all  <dig> elderly  hcc patients enrolled were also serum hbsag positive and anti-hcv negative. comparative genomics analysis was further performed for elucidating enriched or suppressed biological activities in different hcc subtypes.

the yhcc group showed more macroscopic venous invasions , fewer associated cirrhosis , and distinct profiles of expressed genes, especially those related to dna replication and repair. yhccs possessed increased embryonic stem cell  traits and were more dedifferentiated. a 309-gene signature was obtained from two training cohorts and validated in another independent data set. the ilf <dig> esc gene, which was previously reported in poorly differentiated breast cancers and bladder carcinomas, was also present in yhccs. genes associated with hcc suppression, including ar and adra1a, were less abundant in yhccs. esc genes were also more enriched in advanced hccs from elderly patients.


CONCLUSIONS
this study revealed the molecular makeup of yhcc and the link between esc traits and hcc subtypes. findings in elderly tumors, therefore, cannot be simply extrapolated to young patients, and yhcc should be treated differently.
