BACKGROUND
postpartum endometritis in cattle is a multifactorial disease with high economic impact. both, clinical endometritis  and subclinical endometritis  result in decreased reproductive performance. results from in vitro studies led to the implication that non-esterified fatty acids , beta-hydroxybutyric acid , bilirubin, and urea could be used as predictors for endometritis in veterinary practice. in this field study, we set out to establish optimal predictor cut points of these metabolic parameters for the detection of ce and sce. serum samples were collected one week prior to parturition , in the first week postpartum  and between  <dig> and  <dig> days postpartum  from  <dig> holstein-friesian cows. at wk + <dig>  all cows were examined for signs of ce and sce.


RESULTS
higher concentrations of urea at wk + <dig> were associated with increased odds of ce  in primiparous  cows. a predictor cut point of  <dig>  mmol/l  was determined. in multiparous  cows, the logistic regression model revealed that higher concentrations of nefa at wk - <dig> were associated with increased odds of ce and sce . a predictor cut point of  <dig>  mmol/l  was determined. increasing concentrations of urea at wk + <dig> were associated with decreased odds of ce . a predictor cut point of  <dig>  mmol/l  was determined. for bhba and bilirubin relationships with ce or sce were not detected.


CONCLUSIONS
the corresponding combinations of sensitivity and specificity of the determined predictor cut points were not satisfactory for practical use. thus, the analysed parameters, i.e. nefa, bhba, bilirubin, and urea, at the chosen time points, i.e. at wk - <dig>  at wk + <dig>  and at wk + <dig> relative to calving, are unsatisfactory for disease prediction. further research is required to clarify the questions raised by the current study.
