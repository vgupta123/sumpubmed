BACKGROUND
comparison of short peptides which form amyloid-fibrils with their homologues that may form amorphous β-aggregates but not fibrils, can aid development of novel amyloid-containing nanomaterials with well defined morphologies and characteristics. the knowledge gained from the comparative analysis could also be applied towards identifying potential aggregation prone regions in proteins, which are important for biotechnology applications or have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. in this work we have systematically analyzed a set of  <dig> amyloid-fibril hexa-peptides along with a highly homologous set of  <dig> hexa-peptides that do not form amyloid fibrils for their position-wise as well as overall amino acid compositions and averages of  <dig> selected amino acid properties.


RESULTS
amyloid-fibril forming peptides show distinct preferences and avoidances for amino acid residues to occur at each of the six positions. as expected, the amyloid fibril peptides are also more hydrophobic than non-amyloid peptides. we have used the results of this analysis to develop statistical potential energy values for the  <dig> amino acid residues to occur at each of the six different positions in the hexa-peptides. the distribution of the potential energy values in  <dig> amyloid and  <dig> non-amyloid fibrils are distinct and the amyloid-fibril peptides tend to be more stable  than non-amyloid peptides. the average frequency of occurrence of these peptides with lower than specific cutoff energies at different positions is 72% and 50%, respectively. the potential energy values were used to devise a statistical discriminator to distinguish between amyloid-fibril and non-amyloid peptides. our method could identify the amyloid-fibril forming hexa-peptides to an accuracy of 89%. on the other hand, the accuracy of identifying non-amyloid peptides was only 54%. further attempts were made to improve the prediction accuracy via machine learning. this resulted in an overall accuracy of  <dig> % with the sensitivity and specificity of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, in 10-fold cross-validation method.


CONCLUSIONS
amyloid-fibril forming hexa-peptides show position specific sequence features that are different from those which may form amorphous β-aggregates. these positional preferences are found to be important features for discriminating amyloid-fibril forming peptides from their homologues that don't form amyloid-fibrils.
