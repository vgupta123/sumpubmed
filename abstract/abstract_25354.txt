BACKGROUND
recently, we and others proposed plasticity-related gene  <dig>  as a novel molecule in neuritogenesis based on prg <dig> overexpression experiments in neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines. however, direct information on prg <dig> effects in neuronal development and, in particular, its putative spatio-temporal distribution and conditions of action, is sparse.


RESULTS
we demonstrate here that prg <dig> induces filopodia formation in hek <dig> cells depending on its n-glycosylation status. the prg <dig> protein was strongly expressed during mouse brain development in vivo from embryonic day  <dig> to postnatal day  <dig> . from p <dig> on, expression declined. furthermore, in early, not yet polarized hippocampal cultured neurons, prg <dig> was expressed along the neurite shaft. knock-down of prg <dig> in these neurons led to a decreased number of neurites. this phenotype is rescued by expression of an shrna-resistant prg <dig> construct in prg <dig> knock-down neurons. after polarization, endogenous prg <dig> expression shifted mainly to axons, specifically to the plasma membrane along the neurite shaft. these prg <dig> pattern changes appeared temporally and spatially related to ongoing synaptogenesis. therefore we tested  whether dendritic prg <dig> re-enhancement influences synaptic currents and  whether synaptic inputs contribute to the prg <dig> shift. our results rendered both scenarios unlikely:  prg <dig> over-expression had no influence on miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents  and  blocking of incoming signals did not alter prg <dig> distribution dynamics. in addition, prg <dig> levels did not interfere with intrinsic neuronal properties.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data indicate that endogenous prg <dig> promotes neurite shaft protrusion and therefore contributes to regulating filopodia formation in immature neurons. prg <dig> expression in more mature neurons, however, is predominantly localized in the axon. changes in prg <dig> levels did not influence intrinsic or synaptic neuronal properties.
