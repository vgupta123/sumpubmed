BACKGROUND
a large number of studies have been carried out to obtain amino acid propensities for α-helices and β-sheets. the obtained propensities for α-helices are consistent with each other, and the pair-wise correlation coefficient is frequently high. on the other hand, the β-sheet propensities obtained by several studies differed significantly, indicating that the context significantly affects β-sheet propensity.


RESULTS
we calculated amino acid propensities for α-helices and β-sheets for  <dig> and  <dig> protein folds, respectively, and addressed whether they correlate with the fold. the propensities were also calculated for exposed and buried sites, respectively. results showed that α-helix propensities do not differ significantly by fold, but β-sheet propensities are diverse and depend on the fold. the propensities calculated for exposed sites and buried sites are similar for α-helix, but such is not the case for the β-sheet propensities. we also found some fold dependence on amino acid frequency in β-strands. folds with a high ser, thr and asn content at exposed sites in β-strands tend to have a low leu, ile, glu, lys and arg content  and to have flat β-sheets. at buried sites in β-strands, the content of tyr, trp, gln and ser correlates negatively with the content of val, ile and leu . "all-β" proteins tend to have a higher content of tyr, trp, gln and ser, whereas "α/β" proteins tend to have a higher content of val, ile and leu.


CONCLUSIONS
the α-helix propensities are similar for all folds and for exposed and buried residues. however, β-sheet propensities calculated for exposed residues differ from those for buried residues, indicating that the exposed-residue fraction is one of the major factors governing amino acid composition in β-strands. furthermore, the correlations we detected suggest that amino acid composition is related to folding properties such as the twist of a β-strand or association between two β sheets.
