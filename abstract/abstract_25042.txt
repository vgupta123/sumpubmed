BACKGROUND
a hallmark of prion disease is the transformation of normal cellular prion protein  into an infectious disease-associated isoform, . anti-prion protein monoclonal antibodies are invaluable for structure-function studies of prp molecules. furthermore recent in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that anti-prp monoclonal antibodies can prevent the incorporation of prpc into propagating prions.

in the present article, we show two new human phage antibodies, isolated on recombinant hamster prion protein .


RESULTS
we adopted an antibody phage display strategy to isolate specific human antibodies directed towards rhaprp which has been used as a bait for panning the synthetic eth- <dig> antibody phage library. two phage antibodies clones named ma <dig> b <dig> and ma <dig> g <dig> were isolated and characterized under genetic biochemical and immunocytochemical aspects. the clones were found to recognize the prion protein in elisa studies. in flow-cytometry studies, these human single chain fragment variable  phage-antibodies show a well defined pattern of reactivity on human lymphoblastoid and myeloid cells.


CONCLUSIONS
sequence analysis of the gene encoding for the antibody fragments and antigen recognition patterns determined by flow-cytometry analysis indicate that the isolated scfvs recognize novel epitopes in the prpc molecule. these new anti prpc human antibodies are unique reagents for prion protein detection and may represent a biologic platform to develop new reagents to treat prpsc associated disease.
