BACKGROUND
psi-blast, an extremely popular tool for sequence similarity search, features the utilization of position-specific scoring matrix  constructed from a multiple sequence alignment . pssm allows the detection of more distant homologs than a general amino acid substitution matrix does. an accurate estimation of the weights for sequences in an msa is crucially important for pssm construction. psi-blast divides a given msa into multiple blocks, for which sequence weights are calculated. when the block width becomes very narrow, the sequence weight calculation can be odd.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that psi-blast indeed generates a significant fraction of blocks having width less than  <dig>  thereby degrading the psi-blast performance. we revised the code of psi-blast to prevent the blocks from being narrower than a given minimum block width . we designate the modified application of psi-blast as psi-blastexb. when mbw is  <dig>  psi-blastexb notably outperforms psi-blast consistently for three independent benchmark sets. the performance boost is even more drastic when an msa, instead of a sequence, is used as a query.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that the generation of narrow-width blocks during the sequence weight calculation is a critically important factor that restricts the psi-blast search performance. by preventing narrow blocks, psi-blastexb upgrades the psi-blast performance remarkably. binaries and source codes of psi-blastexb  are available at https://github.com/kyungtaeklim/psi-blastexb.
