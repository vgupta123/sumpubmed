BACKGROUND
transposable elements form a significant proportion of eukaryotic genomes. recently, lexa et al.  reported that plant long terminal repeat  retrotransposons often contain potential quadruplex sequences  in their ltrs and experimentally confirmed their ability to adopt four-stranded dna conformations.


RESULTS
here, we searched for pqss in human retrotransposons and found that pqss are specifically localized in the 3’-utr of line- <dig> elements, in ltrs of herv elements and are strongly accumulated in specific regions of sva elements. circular dichroism spectroscopy confirmed that most pqss had adopted monomolecular or bimolecular guanine quadruplex structures. evolutionarily young sva elements contained more pqss than older elements and their propensity to form quadruplex dna was higher. full-length l <dig> elements contained more pqss than truncated elements; the highest proportion of pqss was found inside transpositionally active l <dig> elements .


CONCLUSIONS
conservation of quadruplexes at specific positions of transposable elements implies their importance in their life cycle. the increasing quadruplex presence in evolutionarily young line- <dig> and sva families makes these elements important contributors toward present genome-wide quadruplex distribution.
