BACKGROUND
radish  is a widespread agricultural plant forming storage root due to extensive secondary growth which involves cambium proliferation and differentiation of secondary conductive tissues. closely related to the model object arabidopsis thaliana, radish is a suitable model for studying processes of secondary growth and storage root development. cle peptides are a group of peptide phytohormones which play important role in the regulation of primary meristems such as sam, ram, and procambium, as well as secondary meristems. however, the role of cle peptides in lateral growth of root during storage root formation has not been studied to date.


RESULTS
in present work we studied the role of cle peptides in the development of storage root in radish. we have identified  <dig> cle genes of radish  and measured their expression in various plant organs and also at different stages of root development in r. sativus and raphanus raphanistrum—its close relative which does not form storage root. we observed significant decline of expression levels for genes rscle <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and also multifold increase of expression levels for genes rscle <dig>  and  <dig> during secondary root growth in r. sativus but not in r. raphanistrum. expression of rscle  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in r. sativus root was confined to certain types of tissues while rscle <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> expressed throughout the root. experiments on overexpression of rscle <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> or treatment of radish plants with synthetic cle peptides revealed that cle <dig> and cle <dig> increase the number of xylem elements, and cle <dig> induces the formation of extra cambium foci in secondary xylem. expression levels of rscle <dig> and  <dig> strongly decrease in response to exogenous cytokinin, while auxin causes dramatic increase of rscle <dig> expression level and decrease of rscle <dig> expression.


CONCLUSIONS
our data allow us to hypothesize about the role of rscle <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes in the development of storage root of raphanus sativus, e.g. rscle <dig> may play a role in auxin-dependent processes of xylem differentiation and rscle <dig> stimulates cambium activity.
