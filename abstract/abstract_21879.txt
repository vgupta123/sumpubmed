BACKGROUND
aligning multiple rna sequences is essential for analyzing non-coding rnas. although many alignment methods for non-coding rnas, including sankoff's algorithm for strict structural alignments, have been proposed, they are either inaccurate or computationally too expensive. faster methods with reasonable accuracies are required for genome-scale analyses.


RESULTS
we propose a fast algorithm for multiple structural alignments of rna sequences that is an extension of our pairwise structural alignment method . the accuracies of the implemented software, mxscarna, are at least as favorable as those of state-of-art algorithms that are computationally much more expensive in time and memory.


CONCLUSIONS
the proposed method for structural alignment of multiple rna sequences is fast enough for large-scale analyses with accuracies at least comparable to those of existing algorithms. the source code of mxscarna and its web server are available at .
