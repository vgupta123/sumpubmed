BACKGROUND
plants living at high altitudes are typically exposed to elevated uv-b radiation, and harbor mechanisms to prevent the induced damage, such as the accumulation of uv-absorbing compounds. the maize r2r3-myb transcription factor p <dig> controls the accumulation of several uv-b absorbing phenolics by activating a subset of flavonoid biosynthetic genes in leaves of maize landraces adapted to high altitudes.


RESULTS
here, we studied the uv-b regulation of p <dig> in maize leaves of high altitude landraces, and we investigated how uv-b regulates p1binding to the chs promoter in both low and high altitude lines. in addition, we analyzed whether the expansion in the p <dig> expression domain between these maize landraces and inbred lines is associated to changes in the molecular structure of the proximal promoter, distal enhancer and first intron of p <dig>  finally, using transient expression experiments in protoplasts from various maize genotypes, we investigated whether the different expression patterns of p <dig> in the high altitude landraces could be attributed to trans- or cis-acting elements.


CONCLUSIONS
together, our results demonstrate that, although differences in cis-acting elements exist between the different lines under study, the different patterns of p <dig> expression are largely a consequence of effects in trans.
