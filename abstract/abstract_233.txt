BACKGROUND
slowed muscle relaxation is the contractile hallmark of myotonia congenita, a disease caused by genetic clc- <dig> chloride channel deficiency, which improves with antecedent brief contractions . it is unclear to what extent the myotonia continues to dissipate during continued repetitive contractions and how this relates temporally to muscle fatigue. diaphragm, edl, and soleus muscles were examined in vitro during repetitive  <dig> hz and  <dig> hz train stimulation in a drug-induced  rat myotonia model.


RESULTS
at the onset of stimulation, 9-ac treated diaphragm and edl muscle had markedly prolonged half relaxation and late relaxation times . half relaxation and late relaxation times reached near-normal values over the 5- <dig> and 10- <dig> subsequent contractions, respectively. in both muscles myotonia declined faster during repetitive  <dig> hz than  <dig> hz stimulation, and much faster than the rate of force loss during fatigue at both frequencies. soleus muscle was resistant to the myotonic effects of 9-ac.


CONCLUSIONS
in a drug-induced model of mechanical myotonia, fatigue-inducing stimulation resolves the myotonia, which furthermore appears to be independent from the development of muscle fatigue.
