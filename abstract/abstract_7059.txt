BACKGROUND
mutans streptococci are a group of gram-positive bacteria including the primary cariogenic dental pathogen streptococcus mutans and closely related species. two component systems  composed of a signal sensing histidine kinase  and a response regulator  play key roles in pathogenicity, but have not been comparatively studied for these oral bacterial pathogens.


RESULTS
hks and rrs of  <dig> newly sequenced mutans streptococci strains, including s. sobrinus dsm <dig>  s. ratti dsm <dig> and six s. mutans strains, were identified and compared to the tcss of s. mutans ua <dig> and nn <dig>  two previously genome sequenced s. mutans strains. ortholog analysis revealed  <dig> tcs clusters ,  <dig> orphan hks and  <dig> orphan rrs, of which  <dig> tcs clusters were common to all  <dig> strains,  <dig> were absent in one or more strains, and the other  <dig> were exclusive to individual strains. further classification of the predicted hks and rrs revealed interesting aspects of their putative functions. while tcs complements were comparable within the six s. mutans strains, s. sobrinus dsm <dig> lacked tcss possibly involved in acid tolerance and fructan catabolism, and s. ratti dsm <dig> possessed  <dig> unique tcss but lacked the quorum-sensing related tcs . selected computational predictions were verified by pcr experiments.


CONCLUSIONS
differences in the tcs repertoires of mutans streptococci strains, especially those of s. sobrinus and s. ratti in comparison to s. mutans, imply differences in their response mechanisms for survival in the dynamic oral environment. this genomic level study of tcss should help in understanding the pathogenicity of these mutans streptococci strains.
