BACKGROUND
the availability of high-density snp assays including the bovinesnp <dig>  enables the identification of novel quantitative trait loci  and improvement of the resolution of the locations of previously mapped qtl. we performed a series of genome-wide association studies  using 50 k genotypes scored in  <dig>  animals from  <dig> us beef cattle breeds with observations for twelve body weights, calving ease and carcass traits.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> large-effects qtl  were identified. in general, more qtl were identified in analyses with bigger sample sizes. four large-effect pleiotropic or closely linked qtls located on bta <dig> at 37–42 mb , on bta <dig> at 93 mb, on bta <dig> at 23–26 mb  and on bta <dig> at 4 mb were identified in more than one breed. several breed-specific large-effect pleiotropic or closely linked qtl were also identified. some identified qtl regions harbor genes known to have large effects on a variety of traits in cattle such as plag <dig> and mstn and others harbor promising candidate genes including ncapg, arrdc <dig>  ergic <dig>  sh3pxd2b, hmga <dig>  msrb <dig>  lemd <dig>  tigar, sept <dig>  and kirrel <dig>  gene ontology analysis revealed that genes involved in ossification and in adipose tissue development were over-represented in the identified pleiotropic qtl. also, the mapk signaling pathway was identified as a common pathway affected by the genes located near the pleiotropic qtl.


CONCLUSIONS
this largest gwas ever performed in beef cattle, led us to discover several novel across-breed and breed-specific large-effect pleiotropic qtl that cumulatively account for a significant percentage of additive genetic variance . these results will improve our understanding of the biology of growth and body composition in cattle.
