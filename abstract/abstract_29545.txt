BACKGROUND
bacterial exported proteins represent key components of the host-pathogen interplay. hence, we sought to implement a combined approach for characterizing the entire exoproteome of the pathogenic bacterium corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, the etiological agent of caseous lymphadenitis  in sheep and goats.


RESULTS
an optimized protocol of three-phase partitioning  was used to obtain the c. pseudotuberculosis exoproteins, and a newly introduced method of data-independent ms acquisition  was employed for protein identification and label-free quantification. additionally, the recently developed tool surfg+ was used for in silico prediction of sub-cellular localization of the identified proteins. in total,  <dig> different extracellular proteins of c. pseudotuberculosis were identified with high confidence by this strategy;  <dig> proteins were commonly identified in two different strains, isolated from distinct hosts, then composing a core c. pseudotuberculosis exoproteome. analysis with the surfg+ tool showed that more than 75%  of the identified proteins could be predicted as containing signals for active exportation. moreover, evidence could be found for probable non-classical export of most of the remaining proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
comparative analyses of the exoproteomes of two c. pseudotuberculosis strains, in addition to comparison with other experimentally determined corynebacterial exoproteomes, were helpful to gain novel insights into the contribution of the exported proteins in the virulence of this bacterium. the results presented here compose the most comprehensive coverage of the exoproteome of a corynebacterial species so far.
