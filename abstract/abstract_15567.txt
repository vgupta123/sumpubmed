BACKGROUND
a recent crystal structure of monastrol in a ternary complex with the kinesin eg <dig> motor domain highlights a novel, induced-fit drug binding site at atomic resolution. mutational obliteration of the monastrol binding site results in a monastrol-resistant, but otherwise catalytically active eg <dig> motor domain. however, considering the conformational changes at this site, it is unclear what specific interactions stabilize the interaction between monastrol and the eg <dig> motor domain.


RESULTS
to study the molecular complementarity of the monastrol-eg <dig> interaction, we used a combination of synthetic chemistry and targeted mutations in eg <dig> to measure the contribution of specific contacts to inhibition of eg <dig> in vitro and in cultured cells. structure-activity data on chemical derivatives, sequence analysis of eg <dig> homologs from different species, and the effect of mutations near the drug binding site were consistent with the crystal structure.


CONCLUSIONS
the mechanism of monastrol revealed by our data rationalizes its specificity for eg <dig> over other kinesins and highlights a potential mechanism of drug resistance for anti-cancer therapy targeting this site in eg <dig>
