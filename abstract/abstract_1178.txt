BACKGROUND
we have reported previously that when chromosome y  from the mouse strain c57bl/6j  was substituted for that of a/j mice , cardiomyocytes from the resulting "chromosome substitution" c57bl/6j-chrya strain were smaller than that of their c57bl/6j counterparts. in reverse, when chrya from a/j mice was substituted for that of chryc <dig>  cardiomyocytes from the resulting a/j-chryc <dig> strain were larger than in their a/j counterparts. we further used these strains to test whether: 1) the origin of chry could also be linked to differences in the profile of gene expression in the hearts of adult male mice, and 2) post-pubertal testosterone could play a role in the differential morphologic and/or molecular effects of chryc <dig> and chrya.


RESULTS
the increased size of cardiomyocytes from adult male c57bl/6j mice compared to c57bl/6j-chrya resulted from the absence of hypertrophic effects of post-pubertal testosterone on cells from the latter strain. however, gene profiling revealed that the latter effect could not be explained on the basis of an insensitivity of cells from c57bl/6j-chrya to androgens, since even more cardiac genes were affected by post-pubertal testosterone in c57bl/6j-chrya hearts than in c57bl/6j. by testing for interaction between the effects of surgery and strain, we identified  <dig> "interaction genes" whose expression was affected by post-pubertal testosterone differentially according to the genetic origin of chry. these interaction genes were found to be enriched within a limited number of signaling pathways, including: 1) p <dig> signaling, which comprises the interacting genes ccnd <dig>  pten and cdkn1a that are also potential co-regulators of the androgen receptors, and 2) circadian rhythm, which comprises arntl/bmal <dig>  which may in turn regulate cell growth via the control of cdkn1a.


CONCLUSIONS
although post-pubertal testosterone increased the size of cardiomyocytes from male c56bl/6j mice but not that from their c57bl/6j-chrya counterparts, it affected gene expression in the hearts from both strains. however, several cardiac genes responded to post-pubertal testosterone in a strict strain-selective manner, which provides possible mechanisms explaining how chry may, in part via interference with androgen regulatory events, be linked to morphologic differences of cardiac cells of adult male mice.
