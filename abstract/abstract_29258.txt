BACKGROUND
cassava  is a tropical root crop, and is therefore, extremely sensitive to low temperature; its antioxidative response is pivotal for its survival under stress. timely turnover of reactive oxygen species  in plant cells generated by chilling-induced oxidative damages, and scavenging can be achieved by non-enzymatic and enzymatic reactions in order to maintain ros homeostasis.


RESULTS
transgenic cassava plants that co-express cytosolic superoxide dismutase , mecu/znsod, and ascorbate peroxidase , meapx <dig>  were produced and tested for tolerance against oxidative and chilling stresses. the up-regulation of mecu/znsod and meapx <dig> expression was confirmed by the quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and enzymatic activity analyses in the leaves of transgenic cassava plant lines with a single-transgene integration site. upon exposure to ros-generating agents, 100 μm ros-generating reagent methyl viologen and  <dig>  m h2o <dig>  higher levels of enzymatic activities of sod and apx were detected in transgenic plants than the wild type. consequently, the oxidative stress parameters, such as lipid peroxidation, chlorophyll degradation and h2o <dig> synthesis, were lower in the transgenic lines than the wild type. tolerance to chilling stress at 4°c for  <dig> d was greater in transgenic cassava, as observed by the higher levels of sod, catalase, and ascorbate-glutathione cycle enzymes  and lower levels of malondialdehyde content.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that the expression of native cytosolic sod and apx simultaneously activated the antioxidative defense mechanisms via cyclic ros scavenging, thereby improving its tolerance to cold stress.
