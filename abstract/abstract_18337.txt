BACKGROUND
low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits  play a crucial role in determining end-use quality of common wheat by influencing the viscoelastic properties of dough. four different methods - sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , two-dimensional gel electrophoresis , matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  and polymerase chain reaction , were used to characterize the lmw-gs composition in  <dig> cultivars from  <dig> countries.


RESULTS
at the glu-a <dig> locus, all seven alleles could be reliably identified by 2-de and pcr. however, the alleles glu-a3e and glu-a3d could not be routinely distinguished from glu-a3f and glu-a3g, respectively, based on sds-page, and the allele glu-a3a could not be differentiated from glu-a3c by maldi-tof-ms. at the glu-b <dig> locus, alleles glu-b3a, glu-b3b, glu-b3c, glu-b3g, glu-b3h and glu-b3j could be clearly identified by all four methods, whereas glu-b3ab, glu-b3ac, glu-b3ad could only be identified by the 2-de method. at the glu-d <dig> locus, allelic identification was problematic for the electrophoresis based methods and pcr. maldi-tof-ms has the potential to reliably identify the glu-d <dig> alleles.


CONCLUSIONS
pcr is the simplest, most accurate, lowest cost, and therefore recommended method for identification of glu-a <dig> and glu-b <dig> alleles in breeding programs. a combination of methods was required to identify certain alleles, and would be especially useful when characterizing new alleles. a standard set of  <dig> cultivars for use in future studies was chosen to represent all lmw-gs allelic variants in the collection. among them, chinese spring, opata  <dig>  seri  <dig> and pavon  <dig> were recommended as a core set for use in sds-page gels. glu-d3c and glu-d3e are the same allele. two new alleles, namely, glu-d3m in cultivar darius, and glu-d3n in fengmai  <dig>  were identified by 2-de. utilization of the suggested standard cultivar set, seed of which is available from the cimmyt and inra clermont-ferrand germplasm collections, should also promote information sharing in the identification of individual lmw-gs and thus provide useful information for quality improvement in common wheat.
