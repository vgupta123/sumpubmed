BACKGROUND
the serine/threonine kinase pak <dig> is an important regulator of cell motility. both pak <dig> and the hormone/cytokine prolactin  have been implicated in breast cancer cell motility, however, the exact mechanisms guiding prl/pak <dig> signaling in breast cancer cells have not been fully elucidated. our lab has previously demonstrated that prl-activated tyrosine kinase jak <dig> phosphorylates pak <dig> on tyrosines  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and that tyrosyl phosphorylated pak <dig>  augments migration and invasion of breast cancer cells.


RESULTS
here we further investigate the mechanisms by which ptyr-pak <dig> enhances breast cancer cell motility in response to prl. we demonstrate a distinct reduction in prl-induced fak auto-phosphorylation in t47d and tmx2- <dig> breast cancer cells overexpressing wild-type pak <dig>  when compared to cells overexpressing either gfp or phospho-tyrosine-deficient mutant pak <dig> . furthermore, ptyr-pak <dig> phosphorylates mek <dig> on ser <dig> resulting in subsequent erk1/ <dig> activation. prl-induced fak auto-phosphorylation is rescued in pak <dig> wt cells by inhibiting tyrosine phosphatases and tyrosine phosphatase inhibition abrogates cell motility and invasion in response to prl. sirna-mediated knockdown of the tyrosine phosphatase ptp-pest rescues fak auto-phosphorylation in pak <dig> wt cells and reduces both cell motility and invasion. finally, we provide evidence that prl-induced ptyr-pak <dig> stimulates tumor cell metastasis in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
these data provide insight into the mechanisms guiding prl-mediated breast cancer cell motility and invasion and highlight a significant role for ptyr-pak <dig> in breast cancer metastasis.
