BACKGROUND
copy number variation  can lead to intra-specific genome variations. it is not only part of normal genetic variation, but also is the source of phenotypic differences. rice  is a model organism with a well-annotated genome, but investigation of cnvs in rice lags behind its mammalian counterparts.


RESULTS
we comprehensively assayed cnvs using high-density array comparative genomic hybridization in a panel of  <dig> asian cultivated rice comprising six indica, three aus, two rayada, two aromatic, three tropical japonica, and four temperate japonica varieties. we used a stringent criterion to identify a total of  <dig> high-confidence copy number variable regions , which span  <dig>  mb  of the rice genome, overlapping  <dig> genes. these genes were significantly enriched for specific biological functions involved in cell death, protein phosphorylation, and defense response. transposable elements  and other repetitive sequences were identified in the majority of cnvrs. chromosome  <dig> showed the greatest enrichment for cnvs. of subspecies-specific cnvrs,  <dig> % and  <dig> % were observed in only one cultivar of ssp. indica and ssp. japonica, respectively. some cnvs with high frequency differences among groups resided in genes underlying rice adaptation.


CONCLUSIONS
higher recombination rates and the presence of homologous gene clusters are probably predispositions for generation of the higher number of cnvs on chromosome  <dig> by non-allelic homologous recombination events. the subspecies-specific variants are enriched for rare alleles, which suggests that cnvs are relatively recent events that have arisen within breeding populations. a number of the cnvs identified in this study are candidates for generation of group-specific phenotypes.
