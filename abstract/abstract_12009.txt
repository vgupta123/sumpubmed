BACKGROUND
bacteria biotopes cover a wide range of diverse habitats including animal and plant hosts, natural, medical and industrial environments. the high volume of publications in the microbiology domain provides a rich source of up-to-date information on bacteria biotopes. this information, as found in scientific articles, is expressed in natural language and is rarely available in a structured format, such as a database. this information is of great importance for fundamental research and microbiology applications . the automatic extraction of this information from texts will provide a great benefit to the field.

methods
we present a new method for extracting relationships between bacteria and their locations using the alvis framework. recognition of bacteria and their locations was achieved using a pattern-based approach and domain lexical resources. for the detection of environment locations, we propose a new approach that combines lexical information and the syntactic-semantic analysis of corpus terms to overcome the incompleteness of lexical resources. bacteria location relations extend over sentence borders, and we developed domain-specific rules for dealing with bacteria anaphors.


RESULTS
we participated in the bionlp  <dig> bacteria biotope  task with the alvis system. official evaluation results show that it achieves the best performance of participating systems. new developments since then have increased the f-score by  <dig>  points.


CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that the combination of semantic analysis and domain-adapted resources is both effective and efficient for event information extraction in the bacteria biotope domain. we plan to adapt the method to deal with a larger set of location types and a large-scale scientific article corpus to enable microbiologists to integrate and use the extracted knowledge in combination with experimental data.
