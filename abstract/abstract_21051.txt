BACKGROUND
a biomedical entity mention in articles and other free texts is often ambiguous. for example, 13% of the gene names  might refer to more than one gene. the task of gene symbol disambiguation  – a special case of word sense disambiguation  – is to assign a unique gene identifier for all identified gene name aliases in biology-related articles. supervised and unsupervised machine learning wsd techniques have been applied in the biomedical field with promising results. we examine here the utilisation potential of the fact – one of the special features of biological articles – that the authors of the documents are known through graph-based semi-supervised methods for the gsd task.


RESULTS
our key hypothesis is that a biologist refers to each particular gene by a fixed gene alias and this holds for the co-authors as well. to make use of the co-authorship information we decided to build the inverse co-author graph on medline abstracts. the nodes of the inverse co-author graph are articles and there is an edge between two nodes if and only if the two articles have a mutual author. we introduce here two methods using distances  of abstracts for the gsd task. we found that a disambiguation decision can be made in 85% of cases with an extremely high  precision rate just by using information obtained from the inverse co-author graph. we incorporated the co-authorship information into two gsd systems in order to attain full coverage and in experiments our procedure achieved precision of  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % on the human, mouse, fly and yeast gsd evaluation sets, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
based on the promising results obtained so far we suggest that the co-authorship information and the circumstances of the articles' release  can be a crucial building block of any sophisticated similarity measure among biological articles and hence the methods introduced here should be useful for other biomedical natural language processing tasks  as well.
