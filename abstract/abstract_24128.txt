BACKGROUND
tigecycline resistance in acinetobacter baumannii is primarily acquired through overexpression of the adeabc efflux pump. besides aders, other two-component regulatory systems  involving the regulation of this transporter have not been clarified.


RESULTS
in this study, we found that the tcs genes baer and baes are co-transcribed and function as stress responders under high osmotic conditions. the baesr and adeab genes showed increased transcription in both the laboratory-induced and clinical tigecycline-resistant strains compared with the wild-type strain. the deletion of baer in the atcc  <dig> strain led to 67–73% and 68% reduction in adea and adeb expression, respectively, with a resultant 2-fold decrease in the tigecycline minimal inhibition concentration . in contrast, the overexpression of baer resulted in a doubled tigecycline mic, with a more than 2-fold increase in adea and adeb expression. the influence of baer knockout on adeab gene expression can also be observed in the laboratory-induced tigecycline-resistant strain. a time-kill assay showed that the baer deletion mutant showed an approximate 1-log <dig> reduction in colony forming units  relative to the wild-type strain when the tigecycline concentration was  <dig>  μg/ml throughout the assay period. the wild-type phenotype could be restored by trans-complementation with pwh1266-kan
r
-baer. increasing the tigecycline concentration to  <dig>  μg/ml produced an even more marked  <dig> -log <dig> reduction in cfus of the baer deletion mutant at 8 h, while only a  <dig> -log <dig> reduction was observed for the wild-type strain.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these data show for the first time that the baesr tcs influences the tigecycline susceptibility of a. baumannii through the positive regulation of the resistance-nodulation-division efflux pump genes adea and adeb.
