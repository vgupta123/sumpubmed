BACKGROUND
the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis is an obligate anaerobe that requires heme for growth. to understand its heme acquisition mechanism, we focused on a hemin-binding protein , possessing one thioredoxin-like motif and a conserved c-terminal domain, which are proposed to be involved in redox regulation and cell surface attachment, respectively.


RESULTS
we observed that the hbp <dig> gene was transcribed as a  <dig> -kb mrna with subsequent translation resulting in three proteins with molecular masses of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kda in the cytoplasm, and one modified form of the 40-kda protein on the cell surface. a recombinant 40-kda hbp <dig> exhibited thioredoxin activity in vitro and mutation of the two putative active site cysteine residues abolished this activity. both recombinant 40- and 27-kda proteins had the ability to bind hemin, and growth of an hbp <dig> deletion mutant was substantially retarded under hemin-depleted conditions compared with growth of the wild type under the same conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
p. gingivalis hbp <dig> exhibits thioredoxin and hemin-binding activities and is essential for growth in hemin-depleted conditions suggesting that the protein plays a significant role in hemin acquisition.
