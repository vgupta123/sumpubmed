BACKGROUND
c57bl/6j mice possess a single intelectin  gene on chromosome  <dig>  the function of intelectins is not well understood, but roles have been postulated in insulin sensitivity, bacterial recognition, intestinal lactoferrin uptake and response to parasites and allergens. in contrast to c57bl/6j mice, there is evidence for expansion of the itln locus in other strains and at least one additional mouse itln gene product has been described. the aim of this study was to sequence and characterise the itln locus in the 129s <dig> strain, to determine the nature of the chromosomal expansion and to inform possible future gene deletion strategies.


RESULTS
six 129s <dig> bac clones were sequenced and assembled to generate  <dig> kbp of chromosomal sequence, including the entire itln locus of approximately  <dig> kbp. the locus contained six distinct itln genes, two cd <dig> genes and several itln- and cd244-related pseudogenes. it was approximately  <dig> kbp larger than the corresponding c57bl/6j locus. the expansion of the itln locus appears to have occurred through multiple duplications of a segment consisting of a full-length itln gene, a cd <dig> gene and an itln pseudogene fragment. strong evidence for tissue-specific distribution of itln variants was found, indicating that itln duplication contributes more than a simple gene dosage effect.


CONCLUSIONS
we have characterised the itln locus in 129s <dig> mice to reveal six itln genes with distinct sequence and expression characteristics. since c57bl/6j mice possess only a single itln gene, this is likely to contribute to functional differences between c57bl/6j and other mouse strains.
