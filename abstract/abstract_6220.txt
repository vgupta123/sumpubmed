BACKGROUND
the discharge of poorly treated effluents into the environment has far reaching, consequential impacts on human and aquatic life forms. thus, we evaluated the flocculating efficiency of our test bioflocculant and we report for the first time the ability of the biopolymeric flocculant produced by arthrobacter humicola in the treatment of sewage wastewater. this strain was isolated from sediment soil sample at sterkfontein dam in the eastern free state province of south africa.


RESULTS
basic local alignment search tool  analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the 16s rdna revealed the bacteria to have 99% similarity to arthrobacter humicola strain r <dig> and the sequence was deposited in the gene bank as arthrobacter humicola with accession number kc <dig> . flocculating activity was enhanced with the aid of divalent cations, ph  <dig>  at a dosage concentration of  <dig>  mg/ml. the purified bioflocculant was heat stable and could retain more than 78% of its flocculating activity after heating at 100 °c for 25 min. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis demonstrated the presence of hydroxyl and carboxyl moieties as the functional groups. the thermogravimetric analysis was used to monitor the pyrolysis profile of the purified bioflocculant and elemental composition revealed c: o: na: p: k with  <dig> :  <dig> :  <dig> :  <dig> :  <dig>  weight percentage respectively. the purified bioflocculant was able to remove chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand, suspended solids, nitrate and turbidity from sewage waste water at efficiencies of  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study indicate the possibility of using the bioflocculant produced by arthrobacter humicola as a potential alternative to synthesized chemical flocculants in sewage waste water treatment and other industrial waste water.
