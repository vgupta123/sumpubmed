BACKGROUND
the alpha  proteobacteria, a very large and diverse group, are presently characterized solely on the basis of 16s rrna trees, with no known molecular characteristic that is unique to this group. the genomes of three α-proteobacteria, rickettsia prowazekii , caulobacter crescentus  and bartonella quintana , were analyzed in order to search for proteins that are unique to this group.


RESULTS
blast analyses of protein sequences from the above genomes have led to the identification of  <dig> proteins which are distinctive characteristics of α-proteobacteria and are generally not found in any other bacteria. these α-proteobacterial signature proteins are generally of hypothetical functions and they can be classified as follows:  six proteins  which are uniquely present in most sequenced α-proteobacterial genomes;  ten proteins  which are present in all α-proteobacteria except the rickettsiales;  five proteins  not found in the intracellular bacteria belonging to the order rickettsiales and the bartonellaceae family;  four proteins  that are absent from various rickettsiales as well as rhodobacterales;  three proteins  that are unique to the order rickettsiales and four proteins  which are specific for the rickettsiaceae family;  six proteins  which are specific to the order rhizobiales;  four proteins  which are specific for the order rhizobiales excluding the family bradyrhizobiaceae;  nine proteins  six proteins  which show sporadic distribution in α-proteobacteria,  four proteins  in which lateral gene transfers are indicated to have occurred between α-proteobacteria and a limited number of other bacteria.


CONCLUSIONS
the identified proteins provide novel means for defining and identifying the α-proteobacteria and many of its subgroups in clear molecular terms and in understanding the evolution of this group of species. these signature proteins, together with the large number of α-proteobacteria specific indels that have recently been identified , provide evidence that all species from this diverse group share many unifying and distinctive characteristics. functional studies on these proteins should prove very helpful in the identification of such characteristics.
