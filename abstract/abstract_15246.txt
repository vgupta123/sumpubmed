BACKGROUND
alpha-synuclein , a  <dig> amino acid protein associated with presynaptic membranes in brain, is a major constituent of lewy bodies in parkinson's disease . three missense mutations  in the α-syn gene are associated with rare autosomal dominant forms of familial pd. however, the regulation of α-syn's cellular localization in neurons and the effects of the pd-linked mutations are poorly understood.


RESULTS
in the present study, we analysed the ability of cytosolic factors to regulate α-syn binding to synaptic membranes. we show that co-incubation with brain cytosol significantly increases the membrane binding of normal and pd-linked mutant α-syn. to characterize cytosolic factor that modulate α-syn binding properties, we investigated the ability of proteins, lipids, atp and calcium to modulate α-syn membrane interactions. we report that lipids and atp are two of the principal cytosolic components that modulate wt and a53t α-syn binding to the synaptic membrane. we further show that 1-o-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine  is one of the principal lipids found in complex with cytosolic proteins and is required to enhance α-syn interaction with synaptic membrane. in addition, the impaired membrane binding observed for a30p α-syn was significantly mitigated by the presence of protease-sensitive factors in brain cytosol.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that endogenous brain cytosolic factors regulate wt and mutant α-syn membrane binding, and could represent potential targets to influence α-syn solubility in brain.
