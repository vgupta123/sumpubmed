BACKGROUND
previous studies demonstrated the egf-targeted phagemid particles carrying sirna against akt could be expressed efficiently in the presence of hydroxycamptothecin . however, no significant cell growth inhibition was obtained. this study was to further investigate whether the egf-targeted phagemid particles carrying sirna would be a promising tool for anti-cancer sirna delivery.


RESULTS
we found that psi <dig> -sifak phagemid particles could significantly inhibit the expression of focal adhesion kinase in the hcpt-treated cells. moreover, we also observed that the particles could potently suppress cell growth and cell invasion.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicated that egf-targeted phagemid particles might be a promising tool for anti-cancer sirna delivery in the presence of hcpt.
