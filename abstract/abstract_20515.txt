BACKGROUND
a well-informed choice of genetic locus is central to the efficacy of dna barcoding. current dna barcoding in animals involves the use of the 5' half of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase  <dig> gene  to diagnose and delimit species. however, there is no compelling a priori reason for the exclusive focus on this region, and it has been shown that it performs poorly for certain animal groups. to explore alternative mitochondrial barcoding regions, we compared the efficacy of the universal co <dig> barcoding region with the other mitochondrial protein-coding genes in eutherian mammals. four criteria were used for this comparison: the number of recovered species, sequence variability within and between species, resolution to taxonomic levels above that of species, and the degree of mutational saturation.


RESULTS
based on  <dig>  mitochondrial genomes of eutherians, we found that the universal co <dig> barcoding region is a good representative of mitochondrial genes as a whole because the high species-recovery rate  was similar to that of other mitochondrial genes, and there were no significant differences in intra- or interspecific variability among genes. however, an overlap between intra- and interspecific variability was still problematic for all mitochondrial genes. our results also demonstrated that any choice of mitochondrial gene for dna barcoding failed to offer significant resolution at higher taxonomic levels.


CONCLUSIONS
we suggest that the co <dig> barcoding region, the universal dna barcode, is preferred among the mitochondrial protein-coding genes as a molecular diagnostic at least for eutherian species identification. nevertheless, dna barcoding with this marker may still be problematic for certain eutherian taxa and our approach can be used to test potential barcoding loci for such groups.
