BACKGROUND
recently, a new livestock-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  sequence type  <dig>  isolate has emerged worldwide. although there have been reports of invasive disease in humans, mrsa st <dig> colonization is much more common in livestock and demonstrates especially high prevalence rates in pigs and calves. the aim of this study was to compare the genome sequence of an st <dig> mrsa isolate with other s. aureus genomes in order to identify genetic traits that may explain the success of this particular lineage. therefore, we determined the whole genome sequence of s <dig>  an mrsa st <dig> isolate from a human case of endocarditis.


RESULTS
the entire genome sequence of s <dig> demonstrated considerable accessory genome content differences relative to other s. aureus genomes. several mobile genetic elements that confer antibiotic resistance were identified, including a novel composite of an type v  staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec  with distinct joining  regions. the presence of multiple integrative conjugative elements combined with the absence of a type i restriction and modification system on one of the two Î½sa islands, could enhance horizontal gene transfer in this strain. the st <dig> mrsa isolate carries a unique pathogenicity island which encodes homologues of two excreted virulence factors; staphylococcal complement inhibitor  and von willebrand factor-binding protein . however, several virulence factors such as enterotoxins and phage encoded toxins, including panton-valentine leukocidin , were not identified in this isolate.


CONCLUSIONS
until now mrsa st <dig> isolates did not cause frequent invasive disease in humans, which may be due to the absence of several common virulence factors. however, the proposed enhanced ability of these isolates to acquire mobile elements may lead to the rapid acquisition of determinants which contribute to virulence in human infections.
