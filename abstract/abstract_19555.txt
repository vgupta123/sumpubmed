BACKGROUND
the nuclear hormone receptor rorγ regulates transcriptional genes involved in the production of the pro-inflammatory interleukin il- <dig> which has been linked to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease. this transcriptional activity of rorγ is modulated through a protein-protein interaction involving the activation function  <dig>  helix on the ligand binding domain of rorγ and a conserved lxxll helix motif on coactivator proteins. our goal was to develop a rorγ specific inverse agonist that would help down regulate pro-inflammatory gene transcription by disrupting the protein protein interaction with coactivator proteins as a therapeutic agent.


RESULTS
we identified a novel series of synthetic benzoxazinone ligands having an agonist  and inverse agonist  mode of action in a fret based assay. we show that the af <dig> helix of rorγ is proteolytically sensitive when inverse agonist bio <dig> binds. using x-ray crystallography we show how small modifications on the benzoxazinone agonist bio <dig> trigger inverse agonism of rorγ. using an in vivo reporter assay, we show that the inverse agonist bio <dig> displayed specificity for rorγ over ror sub-family members α and β.


CONCLUSIONS
the synthetic benzoxazinone ligands identified in our fret assay have an agonist  or inverse agonist  effect by stabilizing or destabilizing the agonist conformation of rorγ. the proteolytic sensitivity of the af <dig> helix of rorγ demonstrates that it destabilizes upon bio <dig> inverse agonist binding perturbing the coactivator protein binding site. our structural investigation of the bio <dig> agonist and bio <dig> inverse agonist structures identified residue met <dig> on rorγ as the trigger for rorγ specific inverse agonism.
