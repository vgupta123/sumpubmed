BACKGROUND
as a human replacement, the crab-eating macaque  is an invaluable non-human primate model for biomedical research, but the lack of genetic information on this primate has represented a significant obstacle for its broader use.


RESULTS
here, we sequenced the transcriptome of  <dig> tissues originated from two individuals of crab-eating macaque , and identified genes to resolve the main obstacles for understanding the biological response of the crab-eating macaque. from  <dig> million reads with  <dig>  billion base sequences,  <dig>  isotigs containing genes similar to those of humans,  <dig>  novel isotigs, and  <dig>  singletons were identified using the gs flx sequencing method. approximately 86% of human genes were represented among the genes sequenced in this study. additionally,  <dig> tissue-specific transcripts were identified,  <dig> of which were experimentally validated. in total,  <dig>  alternative splicing  events were identified and analyzed. intriguingly,  <dig> % of as events were associated with transposable element  insertions. finally, investigation of te exonization events and evolutionary analysis were conducted, revealing interesting phenomena of human-specific amplified trends in te exonization events.


CONCLUSIONS
this report represents the first large-scale transcriptome sequencing and genetic analyses of m. fascicularis and could contribute to its utility for biomedical research and basic biology.
