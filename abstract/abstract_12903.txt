BACKGROUND
previous evidence suggested that the differentiation of lin-cd45ra-dc precursors were prior to plasmcytoid dendritic cells  than myeloid dendritic cells  within ovarian cancer microenvironment. however, the mechanism is still unclear. therefore, we investigated the function of notch  <dig> signal pathway in the differentiation of lin-cd45ra-dc precursors.

methods
the cd34+ hematopoietic stem cells were extracted from umbilical cord blood in term parturition, and lin-cd45ra-dc precusors were separated and induced mature. expression of notch <dig> receptor and ligands in lin-cd45ra-dc precusors was detected by real-time pcr and was down-regulated by shrna or γ-secretase inhibitor . flow cytometry was used to analyze the subset of dcs with or without skov <dig> culture supernatants. il- <dig> level was detected by elisa.


RESULTS
expression of notch <dig> receptors and ligands were detected in lin-cd45ra-dc precursor cells. the notch <dig> mrna in lin-cd45ra-dc precursors can be down-regulated by shrna-notch <dig> lentivirus transfection and gsi. shrna mediated notch  <dig> knock-down significantly differentiated less plasmcytoid dendritic cells , but generated more myeloid dendritic cells , and this would not be influenced by the supernatant of the ovarian carcinoma cell line. gsi had the same effect in the differentiation of pdc. the secretion of il- <dig> significantly increased after notch <dig> knock-down with or without skov <dig> culture supernatants.


CONCLUSIONS
notch <dig> is an important signaling pathway in the differentiation of lin-cd45ra-dc precursor cells to plasmcytoid dendritic cells . and this would not be affected by the supernatant of the ovarian carcinoma cell line.
