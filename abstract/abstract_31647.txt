BACKGROUND
coxiella burnetii is the etiological agent of q fever. the clinical diagnosis of q fever is mainly based on several serological tests. these tests all need coxiella organisms which are difficult and hazardous to culture and purify.


RESULTS
an immunoproteomic study of c. burnetii xinqiao strain isolated in china was conducted with the sera from experimentally infected balb/c mice and q fever patients. twenty of whole proteins of xinqiao recognized by the infection sera were identified by mass spectrometry. nineteen of the  <dig> proteins were successfully expressed in escherichia coli and used to fabricate a microarray which was probed with q fever patient sera. as a result, groel, ybgf, rpll, mip, omph, com <dig>  and dnak were recognized as major seroreactive antigens. the major seroreactive proteins were fabricated in a small microarray and further analyzed with the sera of patients with rickettsial spotted fever, legionella pneumonia or streptococcal pneumonia. in this analysis, these proteins showed fewer cross-reactions with the tested sera.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that these  <dig> coxiella proteins gave a modest sensitivity and specificity for recognizing of q fever patient sera, suggesting that they are potential serodiagnostic markers for q fever.
