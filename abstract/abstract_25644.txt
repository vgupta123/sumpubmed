BACKGROUND
the signaling second messenger cyclic amp  regulates many aspects of cellular function in all organisms. previous studies have suggested a role for camp in the regulation of gene expression of cellulolytic enzymes in trichoderma reesei .

methods
the effects of camp in t. reesei were analyzed through both activity and expression of cellulase, intracellular camp level measurement, western blotting, indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy.


RESULTS
to elucidate the involvement of camp in the cellulase expression, we analyzed the growth of the mutant strain ∆acy <dig> and its parental strain qm <dig> in the presence of the inducers cellulose, cellobiose, lactose, or sophorose, and the repressor glucose. our results indicated that camp regulates the expression of cellulase in a carbon source-dependent manner. the expression cel7a, and cel6a genes was higher in the presence of sophorose than in the presence of cellulose, lactose, cellobiose, or glucose. moreover, intracellular levels of camp were up to four times higher in the presence of sophorose compared to other carbon sources. concomitantly, our immunofluorescence microscopy and western blot data suggest that in the presence of sophorose, camp may regulate secretion of cellulolytic enzymes in t. reesei.


CONCLUSIONS
these results allow us to better understand the role of camp and expand our knowledge on the signal transduction pathways involved in the regulation of cellulase expression in t. reesei. finally, our data may help develop new strategies to improve the expression of cel7a and cel6a genes, and therefore, favor their application in several biotechnology fields.
