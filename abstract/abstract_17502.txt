BACKGROUND
coho salmon  transgenic for growth hormone  express gh in multiple tissues which results in increased appetite and continuous high growth with satiation feeding. restricting gh-transgenics to the same lower ration  as wild-type fish  results in similar growth, but with the recruitment of fewer, larger diameter, muscle skeletal fibres to reach a given body size. in order to better understand the genetic mechanisms behind these different patterns of muscle growth and to investigate how the decoupling of gh and nutritional signals affects gene regulation we used rna-seq to compare the fast skeletal muscle transcriptome in tr and wt coho salmon.


RESULTS
illumina sequencing of individually barcoded libraries from  <dig> wt and  <dig> tr coho salmon yielded  <dig> , <dig> paired end reads which were used to construct  <dig>  contigs containing  <dig>  unique genes of which > <dig>  contained > <dig> % of the coding sequence. transcripts coding for  <dig> genes required for myoblast fusion were identified with  <dig> significantly downregulated in tr relative to wt fish, including  <dig>  associated with signaling through the cell surface protein cadherin. nineteen out of  <dig>  translation initiation factors and  <dig> of  <dig>  protein chaperones were upregulated in tr relative to wt fish.


CONCLUSIONS
tr coho salmon showed increased growth hormone transcripts and gene expression associated with protein synthesis and folding than wt fish even though net rates of protein accretion were similar. the uncoupling of gh and amino acid signals likely results in additional costs of transcription associated with protein turnover in tr fish. the predicted reduction in the ionic costs of homeostasis in tr fish associated with increased fibre size were shown to involve multiple pathways regulating myotube fusion, particularly cadherin signaling.
