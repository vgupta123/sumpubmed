BACKGROUND
multi-signal processing circuits are essential for rational design of sophisticated synthetic systems with good controllability and modularity, therefore, enable construction of high-level networks. moreover, light-inducible systems provide fast and reversible means for spatiotemporal control of gene expression.


RESULTS
here, in hek  <dig> cells, we present combinatory genetic circuits responding to light and chemical signals, simultaneously. we first constructed a dual input circuit converting different light intensities into varying of the sensitivity of the promoter to a chemical inducer . next, we generated a ternary input circuit, which responded to light, doxycycline and cumate. this circuit allowed us to use different combinations of blue light and the two chemical inducers to generate gradual output values over two orders of magnitude.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, in this study, we devise genetic circuits sensing and processing light and chemical inducers. our work may provide insights into bio-computation and fine-tuning expression of the transgene.
