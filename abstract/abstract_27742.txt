BACKGROUND
the endophytic fungus, neotyphodium coenophialum, can enhance drought tolerance of its host grass, tall fescue. to investigate endophyte effects on plant responses to acute water deficit stress, we did comprehensive profiling of plant metabolite levels in both shoot and root tissues of genetically identical clone pairs of tall fescue with endophyte  and without endophyte  in response to direct water deficit stress. the e- clones were generated by treating e+ plants with fungicide and selectively propagating single tillers. in time course studies on the e+ and e- clones, water was withheld from  <dig> to 5 days, during which levels of free sugars, sugar alcohols, and amino acids were determined, as were levels of some major fungal metabolites.


RESULTS
after 2–3 days of withholding water, survival and tillering of re-watered plants was significantly greater for e+ than e- clones. within two to three days of withholding water, significant endophyte effects on metabolites manifested as higher levels of free glucose, fructose, trehalose, sugar alcohols, proline and glutamic acid in shoots and roots. the fungal metabolites, mannitol and loline alkaloids, also significantly increased with water deficit.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that symbiotic n. coenophialum aids in survival and recovery of tall fescue plants from water deficit, and acts in part by inducing rapid accumulation of these compatible solutes soon after imposition of stress.
