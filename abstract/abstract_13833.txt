BACKGROUND
maize is a major staple food crop globally and contains various concentrations of vitamins. folates are essential water-soluble b-vitamins that play an important role as one-carbon  donors and acceptors in organisms. to gain an understanding of folate metabolism in maize, we performed an intensive in silico analysis to screen for genes involved in folate metabolism using publicly available databases, followed by examination of the transcript expression patterns and profiling of the folate derivatives in the kernels of two maize inbred lines.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> candidate genes corresponding to  <dig> folate metabolism-related enzymes were identified. the maize genome contains all the enzymes required for folate and c <dig> metabolism, characterized by highly conserved functional domains across all the other species investigated. phylogenetic analysis revealed that these enzymes in maize are conserved throughout evolution and have a high level of similarity with those in sorghum and millet. the lc-ms analyses of two maize inbred lines demonstrated that 5-methyltetrahydrofolate was the major form of folate derivative in young seeds, while 5-formyltetrahydrofolate in mature seeds. most of the genes involved in folate and c <dig> metabolism exhibited similar transcriptional expression patterns between these two maize lines, with the highest transcript abundance detected on day after pollination   <dig> and the decreased transcript abundance on dap  <dig> and  <dig>  compared with the seeds on dap  <dig>  5-methyltetrahydrofolate was decreased and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate was increased sharply in the mature dry seeds.


CONCLUSIONS
the enzymes involved in folate and c <dig> metabolism are conserved between maize and other plant species. folate and c <dig> metabolism is active in young developing maize seeds at transcriptional levels.
