BACKGROUND
both bone morphogenetic proteins  and histone deacetylases  have previously been established to play a role in the development of the three major cell types of the central nervous system: neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. we have previously established a connection between these two protein families, showing that hdacs suppress bmp-promoted astrogliogenesis in the embryonic striatum. since hdacs act in the nucleus to effect changes in transcription, an unbiased analysis of their transcriptional targets could shed light on their downstream effects on bmp-signaling.


RESULTS
using neurospheres from the embryonic striatum as an in vitro system to analyze this phenomenon, we have performed microarray expression profiling on bmp2- and tsa-treated cultures, followed by validation of the findings with quantitative rt-pcr and protein analysis. in bmp-treated cultures we first observed an upregulation of genes involved in cell-cell communication and developmental processes such as members of bmp and canonical wnt signaling pathways. in contrast, in tsa-treated cultures we first observed an upregulation of genes involved in chromatin modification and transcription. interestingly, we could not record direct changes in the protein levels of canonical members of bmp <dig> signaling, but we did observe an upregulation of both the transcription factor stat <dig> and its active isoform phospho-stat <dig> at the protein level.


CONCLUSIONS
stat <dig> and smad1/5/ <dig> interact synergistically to promote astrogliogenesis, and thus we show for the first time that hdacs act to suppress bmp-promoted astrogliogenesis by suppression of the crucial partner stat <dig>
