BACKGROUND
in eukaryotes the transcription initiation by rna polymerase ii requires numerous general and regulatory factors including general transcription factors. the general transcription factor tfiif controls the activity of the rna polymerase ii both at the initiation and elongation stages. the glioma amplified sequence  <dig>  has been associated with tfiif via its yeats domain.


RESULTS
using gst pull-down assays, we demonstrated that gas <dig> binds to both, the small subunit  and the large subunit  of tfiif in vitro. the in vivo interaction of gas <dig> and endogenous rap <dig> and rap <dig> was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. gas <dig> binds to two non-overlapping regions of the c-terminus of rap <dig>  there is also an ionic component to the binding between gas <dig> and rap <dig>  there was no evidence for a direct interaction between gas <dig> and tbp or between gas <dig> and rna polymerase ii.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate binding between endogenous gas <dig> and the endogenous tfiif subunits . since we did not find evidence for a binding of gas <dig> to tbp or rna polymerase ii, gas <dig> seems to preferentially bind to tfiif. gas <dig> that does not contain a dna-binding domain appears to be a co-factor of tfiif.
