BACKGROUND
aathep <dig>  the gene product of aq_ <dig> from aquifex aeolicus, shows sequence homology to proteins from most thermophiles, hyperthermophiles, and higher organisms such as man, mouse, and fly. in contrast, there are almost no homologous proteins in mesophilic unicellular microorganisms. aathep <dig> is a thermophilic enzyme exhibiting both atpase and gtpase activity in vitro. although annotated as a nucleotide kinase, such an activity could not be confirmed for aathep <dig> experimentally and the in vivo function of aathep <dig> is still unknown.


RESULTS
here we report the crystal structure of selenomethionine substituted nucleotide-free aathep <dig> at  <dig>  Å resolution using a multiple anomalous dispersion phasing protocol. the protein is composed of a single domain that belongs to the family of 3-layer -structures consisting of nine central strands flanked by six helices. the closest structural homologue as determined by dali is the reca family. in contrast to the latter proteins, aathep <dig> possesses an extension of the β-sheet consisting of four additional β-strands.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the structure of aathep <dig> represents a variation of the reca fold. although the catalytic function of aathep <dig> remains unclear, structural details indicate that it does not belong to the group of gtpases, kinases or adenosyltransferases. a mainly positive electrostatic surface indicates that aathep <dig> might be a dna/rna modifying enzyme. the resolved structure of aathep <dig> can serve as paradigm for the complete thep <dig> family.
