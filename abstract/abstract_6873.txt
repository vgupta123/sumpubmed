BACKGROUND
repeat-induced point mutation  is a fungal genome defence mechanism guarding against transposon invasion. rip mutates the sequence of repeated dna and over time renders the affected regions unrecognisable by similarity search tools such as blast.


RESULTS
derip is a new software tool developed to predict the original sequence of a rip-mutated region prior to the occurrence of rip. in this study, we apply derip to the genome of the wheat pathogen stagonospora nodorum sn <dig> and predict the origin of several previously uncharacterised classes of repetitive dna.


CONCLUSIONS
five new classes of transposon repeats and four classes of endogenous gene repeats were identified after derip. the derip process is a new tool for fungal genomics that facilitates the identification and understanding of the role and origin of fungal repetitive dna. derip is open-source and is available as part of the ripcal suite at http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/ripcal.
