BACKGROUND
multiple system atrophy  is a fatal adult-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by α-synuclein  positive oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions. the latter are associated with a neuronal multisystem neurodegeneration targeting central autonomic, olivopontocerebellar and striatonigral pathways, however the underlying mechanisms of neuronal cell death are poorly understood. previous experiments have shown that oligodendroglial α-syn pathology increases the susceptibility to mitochondrial stress and proteasomal dysfunction leading to enhanced msa-like neurodegeneration. here we analyzed whether oligodendroglial α-syn overexpression in a transgenic mouse model of msa synergistically interacts with focal neuronal excitotoxic damage generated by a striatal injection of quinolinic acid  to affect the degree of striatal neuronal loss.


RESULTS
qa injury led to comparable striatal neuronal loss and optical density of astro- and microgliosis in the striatum of transgenic and control mice. respectively, no differences were identified in drug-induced rotation behavior or open field behavior between the groups.


CONCLUSIONS
the failure of oligodendroglial α-syn pathology to exacerbate striatal neuronal loss resulting from qa excitotoxicity contrasts with enhanced striatal neurodegeneration due to oxidative or proteolytic stress, suggesting that enhanced vulnerability to excitotoxicity does not occur in oligodendroglial α-synucleinopathy like msa.
