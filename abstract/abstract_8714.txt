BACKGROUND
shiga toxin–producing escherichia coli  o157:h <dig> is a well-recognized cause of bloody diarrhea and hemolytic-uremic syndrome . the ability of stec strains to cause human disease is due to the production of shiga toxins. the objectives of this study were to determinate the prevalence, serotypes, antibiotic susceptibility patterns and the genetic capability for shiga toxin production in escherichia coli  strains isolated from dairy cattle farms in two rural communities in the eastern cape province of south africa. 

methods
fecal samples were collected between march and may  <dig>  from individual cattle  in two commercial dairy farms having  <dig> and  <dig> cattle each.

three hundred presumptive isolates obtained were subjected to polymerase chain reactions  for identification of o <dig> serogroup and shiga toxin producing genes  on genomic dna extracted by boiling method. susceptibility of the isolates to  <dig> antibiotics was carried out in vitro by the standardized agar disc-diffusion method. 


RESULTS
 based on direct pcr detection,  <dig>  isolates were identified as o <dig> serogroup. the genetic repertoire for shiga toxin production was present in  <dig>  isolates distributed as stx <dig> , stx <dig>  and stx1/ <dig>  respectively while  <dig> of the isolates did not harbor shiga toxin producing genes. multiple antibiotic resistances were observed among the isolates and genetic profiling of resistance genes identified blaampc 90 %, blacmy 70 %, blactx-m 65 %, blatem 27 % and teta 70 % and stra 80 % genes among the antimicrobial resistance determinants examined.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that dairy cattle farms in the eastern cape province are potential reservoirs of antibiotic resistance determinants in the province.
