BACKGROUND
the formation of dna knots is common during biological transactions. yet, functional implications of knotted dna are not fully understood. moreover, potential applications of dna molecules condensed by means of knotting remain to be explored. a convenient method to produce abundant highly knotted dna would be highly valuable for these studies.


RESULTS
we had previously shown that circularization of the  <dig>  kb linear dna of phage p <dig> inside its viral capsid generates complex knots by the effect of confinement. we demonstrate here that this mechanism is not restricted to the viral genome. we constructed dna cosmids as small as  <dig> kb and introduced them inside p <dig> capsids. such cosmids were then recovered as a complex mixture of highly knotted dna circles. over  <dig> Î¼g of knotted cosmid were typically obtained from  <dig> liter of bacterial culture.


CONCLUSIONS
with this biological system, dna molecules of varying length and sequence can be shaped into very complex and heterogeneous knotted forms. these molecules can be produced in preparative amounts suitable for systematic studies and applications.
