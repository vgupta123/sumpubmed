BACKGROUND
event-related brain potentials  were used to investigate training-related changes in fast visual word recognition of functionally illiterate adults. analyses focused on the left-lateralized occipito-temporal n <dig>  which represents the earliest processing of visual word forms. event-related brain potentials were recorded from  <dig> functional illiterates receiving intensive literacy training for adults,  <dig> functional illiterates not participating in the training and  <dig> regular readers while they read words, pseudowords or viewed symbol strings. subjects were required to press a button whenever a stimulus was immediately repeated.


RESULTS
attending intensive literacy training was associated with improvements in reading and writing skills and with an increase of the word-related n <dig> amplitude. for untrained functional illiterates and regular readers no changes in literacy skills or n <dig> amplitude were observed.


CONCLUSIONS
results of the present study suggest that the word-related n <dig> can still be modulated in adulthood as a result of the improvements in literacy skills.
