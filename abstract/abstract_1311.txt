BACKGROUND
non-heading chinese cabbage  is an important leaf vegetable grown worldwide. however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying tolerance for extreme temperature in nhcc. the limited availability of nhcc genomic information has greatly hindered functional analysis and molecular breeding.


RESULTS
here, we conduct comprehensive analyses of cold and heat treatments in nhcc using rna-seq. approximately  <dig> million paired-end reads representing  <dig>  unigenes with n <dig> length of 1705 bp were obtained. totally,  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  were detected. among which,  <dig> degs were detected in all treatments, including  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated. the enrichment analyses showed  <dig> and  <dig> genes were enriched under cold and heat treatments, respectively. additionally,  <dig>  lncrnas were identified, and  <dig>  belonged to novel lncrnas. the expression of mirnas were more than that of pri-mirnas and lncrnas. furthermore, we constructed a coexpression network for lncrnas and mirnas. it showed  <dig> and  <dig> genes were regulated by lncrnas under cold and heat treatments, respectively. we constructed the flowchart for identifying lncrnas of nhcc using transcriptome. except conducting the de novo transcriptome analyses, we also compared these unigenes with the chinese cabbage proteins. we identified several most important genes, and discussed their regulatory networks and crosstalk in cold and heat stresses.


CONCLUSIONS
we presented the first comprehensive characterization for nhcc crops and constructed the flowchart for identifying lncrnas using transcriptome. therefore, this study represents a fully characterized nhcc transcriptome, and provides a valuable resource for genetic and genomic studies under abiotic stress.
