BACKGROUND
the gram-negative bacterium bordetella pertussis is an important causative agent of pertussis, an infectious disease of the respiratory tract. after introduction of whole-cell vaccines  in the 1950's, pertussis incidence has decreased significantly. because wp were found to be reactogenic, in most developed countries they have been replaced by acellular vaccines . we have previously shown a role for toll-like receptor  <dig>  in pertussis-infected mice and the pertussis toxin -igg response in wp-vaccinated children, raising the issue of the relative importance of tlr <dig> in wp vaccination of mice. here we analyze the effects of wp and ap vaccination and b. pertussis challenge, in tlr4-deficient c3h/hej and wild-type c3h/heouj mice. ap consists of ptx, filamentous hemagglutinin , and pertactin .


RESULTS
we show an important role of tlr <dig> in wp and  ap vaccination, induction of th <dig> and th <dig> cells by wp but not ap vaccination, and induction of th <dig> cells by infection, confirming data by higgins et al. . furthermore, in tlr4-deficient mice, compared to wild-type controls  after vaccination only, ptx-igg , fha-igg, and prn-igg levels were similar,  after infection , lung il-1α and il-1β expression were lower,  after wp vaccination and challenge, prn-igg level and lung il- <dig> expression were higher, while lung il-1β, tnf-α, ifn-γ, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> expression were lower, and lung pathology was absent, and  after ap vaccination and challenge, prn-igg level and lung il- <dig> expression were higher, while ptx-igg level was lower.


CONCLUSIONS
tlr <dig> does not influence the humoral response to vaccination , plays an important role in natural immunity, wp and ap efficacy, and induction of th <dig> and th <dig> responses, is critical for lung pathology and enhances pro-inflammatory cytokine production after wp vaccination and challenge, and diminishes th <dig> responses after both wp and ap vaccination and challenge. wp vaccination does not induce ptx-igg. a role for lps in the efficacy of wp underlines the usefulness of lps analogs to improve bacterial subunit vaccines such as ap.
