BACKGROUND
next-generation sequencing  provides many possibilities for plant virology research. in this study, we performed integrated analyses using plant transcriptome data for plant virus identification using apple stem grooving virus  as an exemplar virus. we used  <dig> publicly available transcriptome libraries from three different studies, two mrna-seq studies and a small rna-seq study.


RESULTS
we de novo assembled nearly complete genomes of asgv isolates fuji and cuiguan from apple and pear transcriptomes, respectively, and identified single nucleotide variations  of asgv within the transcriptomes. we demonstrated the application of ngs raw data to confirm viral infections in the plant transcriptomes. in addition, we compared the usability of two de novo assemblers, trinity and velvet, for virus identification and genome assembly. a phylogenetic tree revealed that asgv and citrus tatter leaf virus  are the same virus, which was divided into two clades. recombination analyses identified six recombination events from  <dig> viral genomes.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our in silico analyses using ngs data provide a successful application of plant transcriptomes to reveal extensive information associated with viral genome assembly, snvs, phylogenetic relationships, and genetic recombination.
