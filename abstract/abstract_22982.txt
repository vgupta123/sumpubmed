BACKGROUND
leprk <dig> and leprk <dig> are two pollen receptor kinases localized to the plasma membrane, where they are present in a high molecular weight complex . leprk <dig> is phosphorylated in mature and germinated pollen, but is dephosphorylated when pollen membranes are incubated with tomato or tobacco style extracts.


RESULTS
here we show that leprk <dig> dephosphorylation is mediated by a heat-, acid-, base-, dtt- and protease-resistant component from tobacco styles. using leprk <dig> phosphorylation as a tracking assay for purification, style exudates were subjected to chloroform extraction, anionic exchange, and c <dig> reverse-phase chromatography columns. we finally obtained a single ~ <dig>  da compound  that we named stil . stil increased pollen tube lengths of in vitro germinated pollen in a dose-dependent manner.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that the leprk complex perceives stil, resulting in leprk <dig> dephosphorylation and an increase in pollen tube growth.
