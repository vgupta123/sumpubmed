BACKGROUND
the rapid evolution of internet technologies and the collaborative approaches that dominate the field have stimulated the development of numerous bioinformatics resources. to address this new framework, several initiatives have tried to organize these services and resources. in this paper, we present the bioinformatics resource inventory , a new approach for automatically discovering and indexing available public bioinformatics resources using information extracted from the scientific literature. the index generated can be automatically updated by adding additional manuscripts describing new resources. we have developed web services and applications to test and validate our approach. it has not been designed to replace current indexes but to extend their capabilities with richer functionalities.


RESULTS
we developed a web service to provide a set of high-level query primitives to access the index. the web service can be used by third-party web services or web-based applications. to test the web service, we created a pilot web application to access a preliminary knowledge base of resources. we tested our tool using an initial set of  <dig> abstracts. almost 90% of the resources described in the abstracts were correctly classified. more than  <dig> descriptions of functionalities were extracted.


CONCLUSIONS
these experiments suggest the feasibility of our approach for automatically discovering and indexing current and future bioinformatics resources. given the domain-independent characteristics of this tool, it is currently being applied by the authors in other areas, such as medical nanoinformatics. biri is available at .
