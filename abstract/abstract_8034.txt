BACKGROUND
synaptic plasticity associated with an important wave of gene transcription and protein synthesis underlies long-term memory processes. calcium  plays an important role in a variety of neuronal functions and indirect evidence suggests that it may be involved in synaptic plasticity and in the regulation of gene expression correlated to long-term memory formation. the aim of this study was to determine whether ca2+ is necessary and sufficient for inducing long-term memory formation. a suitable model to address this question is the pavlovian appetitive conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex in the honeybee apis mellifera, in which animals learn to associate an odor with a sucrose reward.


RESULTS
by modulating the intracellular ca2+ concentration  in the brain, we show that:  blocking i increase during multiple-trial conditioning selectively impairs long-term memory performance;  conversely, increasing i during single-trial conditioning triggers long-term memory formation; and finally,  as was the case for long-term memory produced by multiple-trial conditioning, enhancement of long-term memory performance induced by a i increase depends on de novo protein synthesis.


CONCLUSIONS
altogether our data suggest that during olfactory conditioning ca2+ is both a necessary and a sufficient signal for the formation of protein-dependent long-term memory. ca2+ therefore appears to act as a switch between short- and long-term storage of learned information.
