BACKGROUND
neurogenesis control and the prevention of premature differentiation in the vertebrate embryo are crucial processes, allowing the formation of late-born cell types and ensuring the correct shape and cytoarchitecture of the brain. members of the hairy/enhancer of split ) family of bhlh-orange transcription factors, such as zebrafish her <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  are implicated in the local inhibition of neurogenesis to maintain progenitor pools within the early neural plate. to better understand how these factors exert their inhibitory function, we aimed to isolate some of their functional interactors.


RESULTS
we used a yeast two-hybrid screen with her <dig> as bait and recovered a novel zebrafish hairy/e factor - her8a. using phylogenetic and synteny analyses, we demonstrate that her8a evolved from an ancient duplicate of hes <dig> that was recently lost in the mammalian lineage. we show that her8a is expressed across the mid- and anterior hindbrain from the start of segmentation. through knockdown and misexpression experiments, we demonstrate that her8a is a negative regulator of neurogenesis and plays an essential role in generating progenitor pools within rhombomeres  <dig> and  <dig> - a role resembling that of her <dig>  her8a co-purifies with her <dig>  suggesting that her8a-her <dig> heterodimers may be relevant in this domain of the neural plate, where both proteins are co-expressed. finally, we demonstrate that her8a expression is independent of notch signaling at the early neural plate stage but that soxb factors play a role in its expression, linking patterning information to neurogenesis control. overall, the regulation and function of her8a differ strikingly from those of its closest relative in other vertebrates - the hes6-like proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
our results characterize the phylogeny, expression and functional interactions involving a new her factor, her8a, and highlight the complex interplay of e proteins that generates the neurogenesis pattern of the zebrafish early neural plate.
