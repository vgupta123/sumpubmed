BACKGROUND
bacteroides spp. form a significant part of our gut microbiome and are well known for optimized metabolism of diverse polysaccharides. initial analysis of the archetypal bacteroides thetaiotaomicron genome identified  <dig> glycosyl hydrolases and a large number of uncharacterized proteins associated with polysaccharide metabolism.


RESULTS
bt_ <dig> from bacteroides thetaiotaomicron vpi- <dig> is a protein of unknown function and a member of a large protein family consisting entirely of uncharacterized proteins. initial sequence analysis predicted that this protein has two domains, one on the n- and one on the c-terminal. a psi-blast search found over  <dig> full length and over  <dig> half size homologs consisting only of the n-terminal domain. the experimentally determined three-dimensional structure of the bt_ <dig> protein confirms its two-domain architecture and structural analysis of both domains suggests their specific functions. the n-terminal domain is a putative catalytic domain with significant similarity to known glycoside hydrolases, the c-terminal domain has a beta-sandwich fold typically found in c-terminal domains of other glycosyl hydrolases, however these domains are typically involved in substrate binding. we describe the structure of the bt_ <dig> protein and discuss its sequence-structure relationship and their possible functional implications.


CONCLUSIONS
structural and sequence analyses of the bt_ <dig> protein identifies it as a glycosyl hydrolase, expanding an already impressive catalog of enzymes involved in polysaccharide metabolism in bacteroides spp. based on this we have renamed the pfam families representing the two domains found in the bt_ <dig> protein, pf <dig> and pf <dig>  as putative glycoside hydrolase and glycoside hydrolase-associated c-terminal domain respectively.
