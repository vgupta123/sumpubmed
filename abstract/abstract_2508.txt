BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  is one of the most economically devastating infectious diseases for the swine industry. a better understanding of the disease dynamics and the transmission pathways under diverse epidemiological scenarios is a key for the successful prrs control and elimination in endemic settings. in this paper we used a two step parameter-driven  bayesian approach to model the spatio-temporal dynamics of prrs and predict the prrs status on farm in subsequent time periods in an endemic setting in the us. for such purpose we used information from a production system with  <dig> pig sites that reported  <dig> prrs cases from  <dig> to  <dig> and from which the pig trade network and geographical location of farms  was available. we estimated five pd models with different weights namely:  geographical distance weight which contains the inverse distance between each pair of farms in kilometers,  pig trade weight  which contains the absolute number of pig movements between each pair of farms,  the product between the distance weight and the standardized relative pig trade weight,  the product between the standardized distance weight and the standardized relative pig trade weight, and  the product of the distance weight and the pig trade weight.


RESULTS
the model that included the pig trade weight matrix provided the best fit to model the dynamics of prrs cases on a 6-month basis from  <dig> to  <dig> and was able to predict prrs outbreaks in the subsequent time period with an area under the roc curve  of  <dig>  and the accuracy of 85% .


CONCLUSIONS
the result of this study reinforces the importance of pig trade in prrs transmission in the us. methods and results of this study may be easily adapted to any production system to characterize the prrs dynamics under diverse epidemic settings to more timely support decision-making.
