BACKGROUND
the elongation factor grea binds to rna polymerase and modulates transcriptional pausing. some recent research suggests that the primary role of grea may not be to regulate gene expression, but rather, to promote the progression of replication forks which collide with rna polymerase, and which might otherwise collapse. replication fork collapse is known to generate dsdna breaks, which can be recombinogenic. it follows that grea malfunction could have consequences affecting homologous recombination.


RESULTS
escherichia coli mutants bearing substitutions of the active site acidic residues of the transcription elongation factor grea, d41n and e44k, were isolated as suppressors of growth inhibition by a toxic variant of the bacteriophage lambda red-beta recombination protein. these mutants, as well as a d41a grea mutant and a grea deletion, were tested for proficiency in recombination events. the mutations were found to increase the efficiency of reca-recbcd-mediated and reca-red-mediated recombination, which are replication-independent, and to decrease the efficiency of replication-dependent red-mediated recombination.


CONCLUSIONS
these observations provide new evidence for a role of grea in resolving conflicts between replication and transcription.
