BACKGROUND
plant expansins and fungal swollenin that can disrupt crystalline cellulose have great potential for applications in conversion of biomass. recent studies have been mainly focused on trichoderma reesei swollenin that show relatively low activity in the promotion of cellulosic hydrolysis. our aim was to isolate a novel swollenin with greater disruptive activity, to establish an efficient way of producing recombinant swollenin, and to optimize the procedure using swollenin in facilitation of cellulosic hydrolysis.


RESULTS
a novel gene encoding a swollenin-like protein, poswoi, was isolated from the filamentous fungus penicillium oxalicum by thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr . it consisted of a family  <dig> carbohydrate-binding module  followed by a linker connected to a family  <dig> endoglucanase-like domain. using the cellobiohydrolase i promoter, recombinant poswoi was efficiently produced in t. reesei with a yield of 105Â mg/l, and showed significant disruptive activity on crystalline cellulose. simultaneous reaction with both poswoi and cellulases enhanced the hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose avicel by approximately 50%. using a poswoi-pretreatment procedure, cellulases can produce nearly twice as many reducing sugars as without pretreatment. the mechanism by which poswoi facilitates the saccharification of cellulose was also studied using a cellulase binding assay.


CONCLUSIONS
we present a novel fungal swollenin with considerable disruptive activity on crystalline cellulose, and develop a better procedure for using swollenin in facilitating cellulosic hydrolysis. we thus provide a new approach for the effective bioconversion of cellulosic biomass.
