BACKGROUND
transcrof toxin genes of scorpion species have been published. up to this moment, no information on the gene characterization of m. gibbosus is available.


RESULTS
this study provides the first insight into gene expression in venom glands from m. gibbosus scorpion. a cdna library was generated from the venom glands and subsequently analyzed . sequences from  <dig> high-quality ests were grouped as  <dig> mgib sequences, of those  <dig> sequences,  <dig>  correspond with one or more ests. we identified putative precursor sequences and were grouped them in different categories , resulting in the identification of  <dig> new toxin-like and  <dig> antimicrobial precursors . the analysis of the gene families revealed several new components categorized among various toxin families with effect on ion channels. sequence analysis of a new ktx precursor provides evidence to validate a new ktx subfamily . a second part of this work involves the genomic organization of three meg-chlorotoxin-like genes . genomic dna sequence reveals close similarities  with the sole genomic organization of chlorotoxins ever reported .


CONCLUSIONS
transcriptome analysis is a powerful strategy that provides complete information of the gene expression and molecular diversity of the venom glands . in this work, we generated the first catalogue of the gene expression and genomic organization of toxins from m. gibbosus. our result represents a relevant contribution to the knowledge of toxin transcripts and complementary information related with other cell function proteins and venom peptide transcripts. the genomic organization of the chlorotoxin genes may help to understand the diversity of this gene family.
