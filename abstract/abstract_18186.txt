BACKGROUND
the illumina infinium humanmethylation <dig> beadchip and its successor, infinium methylationepic beadchip, have been extensively utilized in epigenome-wide association studies. both arrays use two fluorescent dyes  to measure methylation level at cpg sites. however, performance difference between dyes can result in biased estimates of methylation levels.


RESULTS
here we describe a novel method, called regression on logarithm of internal control probes  to correct for dye bias on whole array by utilizing the intensity values of paired internal control probes that monitor the two color channels. we evaluate the method in several datasets against other widely used dye-bias correction methods. results on data quality improvement showed that relic correction statistically significantly outperforms alternative dye-bias correction methods. we incorporated the method into the r package enmix, which is freely available from the bioconductor website .


CONCLUSIONS
relic is an efficient and robust method to correct for dye-bias in illumina methylation beadchip data. it outperforms other alternative methods and conveniently implemented in r package enmix to facilitate dna methylation studies.
