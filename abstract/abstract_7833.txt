BACKGROUND
we previously demonstrated nociceptive discharges to be evoked by mechanical noxious stimulation in the prefrontal cortex . the nociceptive responses recorded in the pfc are conceivably involved in the affective rather than the sensory-discriminative dimension of pain. the pfc receives dense projection from the limbic system. monosynaptic projections from the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala  to the pfc are known to produce long-lasting synaptic plasticity. we examined effects of high frequency stimulation  delivered to the bla on nociceptive responses in the rat pfc.


RESULTS
hfs induced long lasting suppression  of the specific high threshold responses of nociceptive neurons in the pfc. microinjection of n-methyl-d-aspartic acid  receptor antagonists , dizocilpine ) and also metabotropic glutamate receptor  group antagonists , and 2--3--d-alanine ), prevented the induction of lls of nociceptive responses. we also examined modulatory effects of dopamine  on the lls of nociceptive responses. with depletion of da in response to 6-hydroxydopamine  injection into the ipsilateral forebrain bundle, lls of nociceptive responses was decreased, while nociceptive responses were normally evoked. antagonists of da receptor subtypes d <dig>  and d <dig>  piperazin-1-yl] methyl}-1h-pyrrolo  pyridine ), microinjected into the pfc, inhibited lls of nociceptive responses.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that bla-pfc pathways inhibited pfc nociceptive cell activities and that the da system modifies the bla-pfc regulatory function.
