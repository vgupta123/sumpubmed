BACKGROUND
rag <dig> and rag <dig> initiate vj recombination by assembling a synaptic complex with a pair of antigen receptor gene segments through interactions with their flanking recombination signal sequence , and then introducing a dna double-strand break at each rss, separating it from the adjacent coding segment. while the rag proteins are sufficient to mediate rss binding and cleavage in vitro, these activities are stimulated by the architectural dna binding and bending factors hmgb <dig> and hmgb <dig>  two previous studies  came to different conclusions regarding whether only one of the two dna binding domains of hmgb <dig> is sufficient to stimulate rag-mediated binding and cleavage of naked dna in vitro. here we test whether this apparent discrepancy is attributed to the choice of divalent metal ion and the concentration of hmgb <dig> used in the cleavage reaction.


RESULTS
we show here that single hmg-box domains of hmgb <dig> stimulate rag-mediated rss cleavage in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of mn2+, but not mg2+. interestingly, the inability of a single hmg-box domain to stimulate rag-mediated rss cleavage in mg2+ is overcome by the addition of partner rss to promote synapsis. furthermore, we show that mutant forms of hmgb <dig> which otherwise fail to stimulate rag-mediated rss cleavage in mg2+ can be substantially rescued when mg2+ is replaced with mn2+.


CONCLUSIONS
the conflicting data published previously in two different laboratories can be substantially explained by the choice of divalent metal ion and abundance of hmgb <dig> in the cleavage reaction. the observation that single hmg-box domains can promote rag-mediated 23-rss cleavage in mg2+ in the presence, but not absence, of partner rss suggests that synaptic complex assembly in vitro is associated with conformational changes that alter how the rag and/or hmgb <dig> proteins bind and bend dna in a manner that functionally replaces the role of one of the hmg-box domains in rag-hmgb <dig> complexes assembled on a single rss.
