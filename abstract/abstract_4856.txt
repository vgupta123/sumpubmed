BACKGROUND
carbapenems resistance in enterobacter spp. has increased in the last decade, few studies, however, described the mechanisms of resistance in this bacterium. this study evaluated clonality and mechanisms of carbapenems resistance in clinical isolates of enterobacter spp. identified in three hospitals in brazil  over 7-year.

methods
antibiotics sensitivity, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , pcr for carbapenemase and efflux pump genes were performed for all carbapenems-resistant isolates. outer-membrane protein  was evaluated based on pfge profile.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> isolates of enterobacter spp were analyzed, 44/ <dig>  e. aerogenes and 8/ <dig>  e. cloacae were resistant to carbapenems. all isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin, polymyxin b and tigecycline. kpc was present in  <dig> % of e. aerogenes and in all e. cloacae resistant to carbapenems. the carbapenems-resistant e. aerogenes identified in hospital a belonged to six clones, however, a predominant clone was identified in this hospital over the study period. there is a predominant clone in hospital b and hospital c as well. the mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems differ among subtypes. most of the isolates co-harbored blakpc, blatem and /or blactx associated with decreased or lost of 35–36kda and or  <dig> kda omp. the efflux pump acrab-tolc gene was only identified in carbapenems-resistant e. cloacae.


CONCLUSIONS
there was a predominant clone in each hospital suggesting that cross-transmission of carbapenems-resistant enterobacter spp. was frequent. the isolates presented multiple mechanisms of resistance to carbapenems including omp alteration.
