BACKGROUND
previous studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that in addition to altering chromatin acetylation and conformation, histone deacetylase inhibitors  disrupt the acetylation status of numerous transcription factors and other proteins. a whole genome yeast deletion library screen was used to identify components of the transcriptional apparatus that modulate the sensitivity to the hydroxamic acid-based hdaci, cg- <dig> 


RESULTS
screening  <dig> haploid saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion strains for sensitivity to cg- <dig> identifies  <dig> sensitive and  <dig> resistant strains. gene ontology  enrichment analysis shows that strains sensitive to cg- <dig> are highly enriched in processes regulating chromatin remodeling and transcription as well as other ontologies, including vacuolar acidification and vesicle-mediated transport. cg-1521-resistant strains include those deficient in the regulation of transcription and trna modification. components of the saga histone acetyltransferase  complex are overrepresented in the sensitive strains, including the catalytic subunit, gcn <dig>  cell cycle analysis indicates that both the wild-type and gcn5Δ strains show a g <dig> delay after cg- <dig> treatment, however the gcn5Δ strain displays increased sensitivity to cg-1521-induced cell death compared to the wild-type strain. to test whether the enzymatic activity of gcn <dig> is necessary in the response to cg- <dig>  growth assays with a yeast strain expressing a catalytically inactive variant of the gcn <dig> protein were performed and the results show that this strain is less sensitive to cg- <dig> than the gcn5Δ strain.


CONCLUSIONS
genome-wide deletion mutant screening identifies biological processes that affect the sensitivity to the hdac inhibitor cg- <dig>  including transcription and chromatin remodeling. this study illuminates the pathways involved in the response to cg- <dig> in yeast and provides incentives to understand the mechanisms of hdac inhibitors in cancer cells. the data presented here demonstrate that components of the saga complex are involved in mediating the response to cg- <dig>  additional experiments suggest that functions other than the acetyltransferase activity of gcn <dig> may be sufficient to attenuate the effects of cg- <dig> on cell growth.
