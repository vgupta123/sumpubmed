BACKGROUND
among the four major bilaterian clades, deuterostomia, acoelomorpha, ecdysozoa, and lophotrochozoa, the latter shows an astonishing diversity of bodyplans. while the largest lophotrochozoan assemblage, the spiralia, which at least comprises annelida, mollusca, entoprocta, platyhelminthes, and nemertea, show a spiral cleavage pattern, ectoprocta, brachiopoda and phoronida  cleave radially. despite a vast amount of recent molecular phylogenetic analyses, the interrelationships of lophotrochozoan phyla remain largely unresolved. thereby, entoprocta play a key role, because they have frequently been assigned to the ectoprocta, despite their differently cleaving embryos. however, developmental data on entoprocts employing modern methods are virtually non-existent and the data available rely exclusively on sketch drawings, thus calling for thorough re-investigation.


RESULTS
by applying fluorescence staining in combination with confocal microscopy and 3d-imaging techniques, we analyzed early embryonic development of a basal loxosomatid entoproct. we found that cleavage is asynchronous, equal, and spiral. an apical rosette, typical for most spiralian embryos, is formed. we also identified two cross-like cellular arrangements that bear similarities to both, a "molluscan-like" as well as an "annelid-like" cross, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
a broad comparison of cleavage types and apical cross patterns across lophotrochozoa shows high plasticity of these character sets and we therefore argue that these developmental traits should be treated and interpreted carefully when used for phylogenetic inferences.
