BACKGROUND
for typing of staphylococcus aureus, dna sequencing of the repeat region of the protein a  gene is a well established discriminatory method for outbreak investigations. recently, it was hypothesized that this region also reflects long-term epidemiology. however, no automated and objective algorithm existed to cluster different repeat regions. in this study, the based upon repeat pattern  implementation that is a heuristic variant of the newly described edsi algorithm was investigated to infer the clonal relatedness of different spa types.

for calibration of burp parameters,  <dig> representative s. aureus strains with different spa types were characterized by mlst and clustered using eburst as "gold standard" for their phylogeny. typing concordance analysis between eburst and burp clustering  were performed using all possible burp parameters to determine their optimal combination. burp was subsequently evaluated with a strain collection reflecting the breadth of diversity of s. aureus .


RESULTS
in total, the  <dig> strains exhibited  <dig> different mlst types. eburst grouped them into  <dig> clonal complexes  and  <dig> singletons . burp clustering of spa types using all possible parameter combinations and subsequent comparison with eburst ccs resulted in concordances ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. however,  <dig> % concordance was reached only if spa types shorter than  <dig> repeats were excluded, which resulted in 37% excluded spa types. therefore, the optimal combination of the burp parameters was "exclude spa types shorter than  <dig> repeats" and "cluster spa types into spa-cc if cost distances are less than 4" exhibiting  <dig> % concordance to eburst. this algorithm identified  <dig> spa-ccs,  <dig> singletons, and excluded only  <dig> % spa types. analyzing the natural population with these parameters, the comparison of whole-genome micro-array groupings  and spa-ccs gave a concordance of  <dig> %; burp spa-ccs vs. manually grouped spa types resulted in  <dig> % concordance.


CONCLUSIONS
burp is the first automated and objective tool to infer clonal relatedness from spa repeat regions. it is able to extract an evolutionary signal rather congruent to mlst and micro-array data.
