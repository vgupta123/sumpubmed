BACKGROUND
the lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii is a member of one of the oldest lineages of vascular plants on earth. fossil records show that the lycophyte clade arose  <dig> million years ago, 150â€“ <dig> million years earlier than angiosperms, a group of plants that includes the well-studied flowering plant arabidopsis thaliana. s. moellendorffii has a genome size of approximately  <dig> mbp, as small or smaller than that of a. thaliana. s. moellendorffii has the potential to provide significant comparative information to better understand the evolution of vascular plants.


RESULTS
we sequenced  <dig> expressed sequence tags  from a s. moellendorffii cdna library. one thousand three hundred and one non-redundant sequences were assembled, containing  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons. approximately 75% of the ests matched proteins in the non-redundant protein database. among  <dig> clusters,  <dig> were categorized according to gene ontology  hierarchy and were compared to the go mapping of a. thaliana tentative consensus sequences. we compared s. moellendorffii ests to the a. thaliana and physcomitrella patens est databases, using the tblastx algorithm. approximately 60% of the ests exhibited similarity with both a. thaliana and p. patens ests; whereas, 13% and 1% of the ests had exclusive similarity with a. thaliana and p. patens ests, respectively. a substantial proportion of the ests  had no match with a. thaliana or p. patens ests.


CONCLUSIONS
we discovered  <dig> putative unigenes in s. moellendorffii. these results give an initial insight into its transcriptome that will aid in the study of the s. moellendorffii genome in the near future.
