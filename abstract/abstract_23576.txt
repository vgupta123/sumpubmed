BACKGROUND
the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor  acts in a conserved pathway that is deregulated in most human cancers. inactivation of the single rb-related gene in caenorhabditis elegans, lin- <dig>  has only limited effects on viability and fertility, yet causes changes in cell-fate and cell-cycle regulation when combined with inactivation of specific other genes. for instance, lin- <dig> rb is a synthetic multivulva  class b gene, which causes a multivulva phenotype when inactivated simultaneously with a class a or c synmuv gene.


RESULTS
we used the orfeome rnai library to identify genes that interact with c. elegans lin- <dig> rb and identified  <dig> genes that showed synthetic or enhanced rnai phenotypes in lin- <dig> mutants as compared to rrf- <dig> and eri- <dig> rnai hypersensitive mutants. based on characterizations of a deletion allele, the synthetic lin- <dig> interactor zfp- <dig> was found to suppress rnai and to cooperate with lin- <dig> rb in somatic gonad development. interestingly, ten splicing-related genes were found to function similar to lin- <dig> rb, as synmuv b genes that prevent inappropriate vulval induction. partial inactivation of specific spliceosome components revealed further similarities with lin- <dig> rb functions in cell-cycle control, transgene expression and restricted expression of germline granules.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified an extensive series of candidate lin- <dig> rb interacting genes and validated zfp- <dig> as a novel lin- <dig> synthetic lethal gene. in addition, we observed a novel role for a subset of splicing components in lin- <dig> rb-controlled processes. our data support novel hypotheses about possibilities for anti-cancer therapies and multilevel regulation of gene expression.
