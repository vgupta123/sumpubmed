BACKGROUND
acidity is an essential component of the organoleptic quality of fleshy fruits. however, in these fruits, the physiological and molecular mechanisms that control fruit acidity remain unclear. in peach the d locus controls fruit acidity; low-acidity is determined by the dominant allele. using a peach progeny of  <dig> f <dig> trees, the d locus was mapped to the proximal end of linkage group  <dig> and co-localized with major qtls involved in the control of fruit ph, titratable acidity and organic acid concentration and small qtls for sugar concentration. to investigate the molecular basis of fruit acidity in peach we initiated the map-based cloning of the d locus.


RESULTS
in order to generate a high-resolution linkage map in the vicinity of the d locus,  <dig>  aflp primer combinations were screened using dna of bulked acid and low-acid segregants. we also screened a segregating population of  <dig>  individuals for chromosomal recombination events linked to the d locus and identified  <dig> individuals with recombination events close to d. using these recombinant individuals we delimited the d locus to a genetic interval of  <dig>  cm. we also constructed a peach bac library of  <dig>  clones with a mean insert size of  <dig> kb. the screening of the bac library with markers tightly linked to d locus indicated that  <dig> cm corresponds to  <dig> kb at the vicinity of the d locus.


CONCLUSIONS
in the present work we presented the first high-resolution genetic map of d locus in peach. we also constructed a peach bac library of approximately 15Ã— genome equivalent. this fine genetic and physical characterization of the d locus is the first step towards the isolation of the gene underlying fruit acidity in peach.
