BACKGROUND
cutaneous mycoses are common human infections among healthy and immunocompromised hosts, and the anthropophilic fungus trichophyton rubrum is the most prevalent microorganism isolated from such clinical cases worldwide. the aim of this study was to determine the transcriptional profile of t. rubrum exposed to various stimuli in order to obtain insights into the responses of this pathogen to different environmental challenges. therefore, we generated an expressed sequence tag  collection by constructing one cdna library and nine suppression subtractive hybridization libraries.


RESULTS
the  <dig> unigenes identified in this study were functionally classified based on the munich information center for protein sequences  categories. the identified proteins were involved in transcriptional regulation, cellular defense and stress, protein degradation, signaling, transport, and secretion, among other functions. analysis of these unigenes revealed  <dig> t. rubrum sequences that had not been previously deposited in public databases.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified novel t. rubrum genes that will be useful for orf prediction in genome sequencing and facilitating functional genome analysis. annotation of these expressed genes revealed metabolic adaptations of t. rubrum to carbon sources, ambient ph shifts, and various antifungal drugs used in medical practice. furthermore, challenging t. rubrum with cytotoxic drugs and ambient ph shifts extended our understanding of the molecular events possibly involved in the infectious process and resistance to antifungal drugs.
