BACKGROUND
pertussis  remains a public health problem despite extensive vaccination strategies. better understanding of the host-pathogen interaction and the detailed b. pertussis  target recognition pattern will help in guided vaccine design. we characterized the specific epitope antigen recognition profiles of serum antibodies  induced by whooping cough and b. pertussis  vaccines from a case–control study conducted in  <dig> in infants enrolled in a bp vaccine trial in sweden .

methods
sera from children with whooping cough, vaccinated with diphtheria tetanus pertussis  whole-cell , acellular  <dig> , or with the  <dig> component  vaccines and from infants receiving only dt  were tested with high-content peptide microarrays containing  <dig> bp proteins displayed as linear  peptide stretches. slides were incubated with serum and peptide-igg complexes detected with cy5-labeled goat anti-human igg and analyzed using a genepix 4000b microarray scanner, followed by statistical analysis, using pam  and the identification of uniquely recognized peptide epitopes.


RESULTS
367/ <dig>   peptides were recognized in 10/ <dig> sera from children with whooping cough,  <dig>  in dtpwc,  <dig>  in dtpa <dig>   <dig>  dtpa <dig>   <dig>  in the dt groups. recognition of strongly recognized peptides was similar between whooping cough and dptwc, but statistically different between whooping cough vs. dtpa <dig> , dtpa <dig> and dt  vaccines. 6/ <dig>  and 2/ <dig>  peptides were exclusively recognized in  sera from children with whooping cough and dtpa <dig> vaccination, respectively. dtpwc resembles more closely the whooping cough reactome as compared to acellular vaccines.


CONCLUSIONS
we could identify a unique recognition signature common for each vaccination group . peptide microarray technology allows detection of subtle differences in epitope signature responses and may help to guide rational vaccine development by the objective description of a clinically relevant immune response that confers protection against infectious pathogens.
