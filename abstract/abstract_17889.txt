BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small  non-coding rnas that are key post-transcriptional gene regulators in eukaryotic organisms. more than  <dig> cassava mirnas have been identified in a conservation analysis and a repertoire of cassava mirnas have also been characterised by next-generation sequencing  in recent studies. here, using ngs, we profiled small non-coding rnas and mrna genes in two cassava cultivars and their wild progenitor to identify and characterise mirnas that are potentially involved in plant growth and starch biosynthesis.


RESULTS
six small rna and six mrna libraries from leaves and roots of the two cultivars, ku <dig> and arg <dig>  and their wild progenitor, w <dig>  were subjected to ngs. analysis of the sequencing data revealed  <dig> conserved mirna families and  <dig> new mirna families. together, these mirnas potentially targeted a total of  <dig> putative target genes. whereas  <dig> mirna families were highly expressed in cultivar leaves, another  <dig> mirna families were highly expressed in storage roots of cultivars. co-expression analysis revealed that the expression level of some targets had negative relationship with their corresponding mirnas in storage roots and leaves; these targets included myb <dig>  arf <dig>  grf <dig>  rd <dig>  apl <dig>  nf-ya <dig> and spl <dig>  which are known to be involved in plant development, starch biosynthesis and response to environmental stimuli.


CONCLUSIONS
the identified mirnas, target mrnas and target gene ontology annotation all shed light on the possible functions of mirnas in manihot species. the differential expression of mirnas between cultivars and their wild progenitor, together with our analysis of go annotation and confirmation of mirna: target pairs, might provide insight into know the differences between wild progenitor and cultivated cassava.
