BACKGROUND
the extent of linkage disequilibrium  within a population determines the number of markers that will be required for successful association mapping and marker-assisted selection. most studies on ld in cattle reported to date are based on microsatellite markers or small numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms  covering one or only a few chromosomes. this is the first comprehensive study on the extent of ld in cattle by analyzing data on  <dig>  holstein-friesian bulls genotyped for  <dig>  snp markers covering all regions of all autosomes. furthermore, most studies in cattle have used relatively small sample sizes and, consequently, may have had biased estimates of measures commonly used to describe ld. we examine minimum sample sizes required to estimate ld without bias and loss in accuracy. finally, relatively little information is available on comparative ld structures including other mammalian species such as human and mouse, and we compare ld structure in cattle with public-domain data from both human and mouse.


RESULTS
we computed three ld estimates, d', dvol and r <dig>  for  <dig> , <dig> syntenic snp pairs and a sample of  <dig>  non-syntenic pairs. mean d' is  <dig>  among syntenic snps, and  <dig>  among non-syntenic snps; mean r <dig> is  <dig>  among syntenic snps and  <dig>  among non-syntenic snps. all three measures of ld for syntenic pairs decline with distance; the decline is much steeper for r <dig> than for d' and dvol. the value of d' and dvol are quite similar. significant ld in cattle extends to  <dig> kb  and  <dig>  mb . the mean values for ld at large physical distances are close to those for non-syntenic snps. minor allelic frequency threshold affects the distribution and extent of ld. for unbiased and accurate estimates of ld across marker intervals spanning <  <dig> kb to >  <dig> mb, minimum sample sizes of  <dig>  and  <dig>  are required. the bias due to small samples sizes increases with inter-marker interval. ld in cattle is much less extensive than in a mouse population created from crossing inbred lines, and more extensive than in humans.


CONCLUSIONS
for association mapping in holstein-friesian cattle, for a given design, at least one snp is required for each  <dig> kb, giving a total requirement of at least  <dig>  snps for a low power whole-genome scan  and up to  <dig>  markers at  <dig> kb intervals for a high power genome scan . for estimation of ld by d' and dvol with sufficient precision, a sample size of at least  <dig> is required, whereas for r <dig> a minimum sample of  <dig> is adequate.
