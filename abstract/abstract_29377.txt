BACKGROUND
whole genome amplification  and laser assisted micro-dissection represent two recently developed technologies that can greatly advance biological and medical research. wga allows the analysis of multiple genomic loci from a single genome and has been performed on single cells from cell suspensions and from enzymatically-digested tissues. laser micro-dissection makes it possible to isolate specific single cells from heterogeneous tissues.


RESULTS
here we applied for the first time wga on laser micro-dissected single cells from stained tissue sections, and developed a protocol for sequentially performing the two procedures. the combined procedure allows correlating the cell's genome with its natural morphology and precise anatomical position. from each cell we amplified  <dig> genomic and mitochondrial loci. in cells obtained from fresh tissue sections,  <dig> % of alleles successfully amplified to ~ <dig> copies each, and mitochondrial dna was amplified successfully in all cells. multiplex pcr amplification and analysis of cells from pre-stored sections yielded significantly poorer results. sequencing and capillary electrophoresis of wga products allowed detection of slippage mutations in microsatellites , and point mutations in p <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
comprehensive genomic analysis of single cells from stained tissue sections opens new research opportunities for cell lineage and depth analyses, genome-wide mutation surveys, and other single cell assays.
