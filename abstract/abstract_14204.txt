BACKGROUND
evoked potentials have been proposed to result from phase-locking of electroencephalographic  activities within specific frequency bands. however, the respective contribution of phasic activity and phase resetting of ongoing eeg oscillation remains largely debated. we here applied the eeglab procedure in order to quantify the contribution of electroencephalographic oscillation in the generation of the frontal n <dig> component of the somatosensory evoked potentials  triggered by median nerve electrical stimulation at the wrist. power spectrum and intertrial coherence analysis were performed on eeg recordings in relation to median nerve stimulation.


RESULTS
the frontal n <dig> component was accompanied by a significant phase-locking of beta/gamma oscillation  and to a lesser extent of  <dig> hz oscillation.

after the selection in each subject of the trials for which the power spectrum amplitude remained unchanged, we found pure phase-locking of beta/gamma oscillation  peaking about  <dig> ms after the stimulation. transition across trials from uniform to normal phase distribution revealed temporal phase reorganization of ongoing  <dig> hz eeg oscillations in relation to stimulation. in a proportion of trials, this phase-locking was accompanied by a spectral power increase peaking in the  <dig> hz frequency band. this corresponds to the complex situation of 'phase-locking with enhancement' in which the distinction between the contribution of phasic neural event versus eeg phase resetting is hazardous.


CONCLUSIONS
the identification of a pure phase-locking in a large proportion of the sep trials reinforces the contribution of the oscillatory model for the physiological correlates of the frontal n <dig>  this may imply that ongoing eeg rhythms, such as beta/gamma oscillation, are involved in somatosensory information processing.
