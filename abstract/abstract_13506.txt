BACKGROUND
intra-sample cellular heterogeneity presents numerous challenges to the identification of biomarkers in large epigenome-wide association studies . while a number of reference-based deconvolution algorithms have emerged, their potential remains underexplored and a comparative evaluation of these algorithms beyond tissues such as blood is still lacking.


RESULTS
here we present a novel framework for reference-based inference, which leverages cell-type specific dnase hypersensitive site  information from the nih epigenomics roadmap to construct an improved reference dna methylation database. we show that this leads to a marginal but statistically significant improvement of cell-count estimates in whole blood as well as in mixtures involving epithelial cell-types. using this framework we compare a widely used state-of-the-art reference-based algorithm  to two non-constrained approaches including cibersort and a method based on robust partial correlations. we conclude that the widely-used constrained projection technique may not always be optimal. instead, we find that the method based on robust partial correlations is generally more robust across a range of different tissue types and for realistic noise levels. we call the combined algorithm which uses dhs data and robust partial correlations for inference, epidish . finally, we demonstrate the added value of epidish in an ewas of smoking.


CONCLUSIONS
estimating cell-type fractions and subsequent inference in ewas may benefit from the use of non-constrained reference-based cell-type deconvolution methods.
