BACKGROUND
the species pectobacterium carotovorum includes a diverse subspecies of bacteria that cause disease on a wide variety of plants. in morocco, approximately 95% of the p. carotovorum isolates from potato plants with tuber soft rot are p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum. however, identification of this pathogen is not always related to visual disease symptoms. this is especially true when different pathogen cause similar diseases on potato, citing as an example, p. carotovorum, p. atrosepticum and p. wasabiae. numerous conventional methods were used to characterize pectobacterium spp., including biochemical assays, specific pcr-based tests, and construction of phylogenetic trees by using gene sequences. in this study, an alternative method is presented using a gene linked to pathogenicity, in order to allow accuracy at subspecies level. the pmra gene  has been used for identification and analysis of the relationships among twenty nine pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and other pectobacterium subspecies.


RESULTS
phylogenetic analyses of pmra sequences compared to eric-pcr and 16s rdna sequencing, demonstrated that there is considerable genetic diversity in p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum strains, which can be divided into two distinct groups within the same clade.


CONCLUSIONS
pmra sequence analysis is likely to be a reliable tool to identify the subspecies pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and estimate their genetic diversity.
