BACKGROUND
public databases now contain multitude of complete bacterial genomes, including several genomes of the same species. the available data offers new opportunities to address questions about bacterial genome evolution, a task that requires reliable fine comparison data of closely related genomes. recent analyses have shown, using pairwise whole genome alignments, that it is possible to segment bacterial genomes into a common conserved backbone and strain-specific sequences called loops.


RESULTS
here, we generalize this approach and propose a strategy that allows systematic and non-biased genome segmentation based on multiple genome alignments. segmentation analyses, as applied to  <dig> different bacterial species, confirmed the feasibility of our approach to discern the 'mosaic' organization of bacterial genomes. segmentation results are available through a web interface permitting functional analysis, extraction and visualization of the backbone/loops structure of documented genomes. to illustrate the potential of this approach, we performed a precise analysis of the mosaic organization of three e. coli strains and functional characterization of the loops.


CONCLUSIONS
the segmentation results including the backbone/loops structure of  <dig> bacterial species genomes are new and available for use by the scientific community at the url: .
