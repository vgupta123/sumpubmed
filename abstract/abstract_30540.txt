BACKGROUND
lentil  is a cool-season grain legume which provides a rich source of protein for human consumption. in terms of genomic resources, lentil is relatively underdeveloped, in comparison to other fabaceae species, with limited available data. there is hence a significant need to enhance such resources in order to identify novel genes and alleles for molecular breeding to increase crop productivity and quality.


RESULTS
tissue-specific cdna samples from six distinct lentil genotypes were sequenced using roche  <dig> gs-flx titanium technology, generating c.  <dig>  Ã—  <dig> expressed sequence tags . de novo assembly generated a total of  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. the complete unigene set was sequence-analysed against genome drafts of the model legume species medicago truncatula and arabidopsis thaliana to identify  <dig> , and  <dig>  unique matches, respectively. when compared to the genome of glycine max, a total of  <dig>  unique hits were observed corresponding to c. 31% of the known gene space. a total of  <dig>  lentil unigenes were subsequently annoated from genbank. simple sequence repeat -containing ests were identified from consensus sequences and a total of  <dig>  primer pairs were designed. a subset of  <dig> est-ssr markers was screened for validation across a panel  <dig> cultivated lentil genotypes and one wild relative species. a total of  <dig> primer pairs obtained successful amplification, of which  <dig> % detected genetic polymorphism.


CONCLUSIONS
a substantial collection of ests has been developed from sequence analysis of lentil genotypes using second-generation technology, permitting unigene definition across a broad range of functional categories. as well as providing resources for functional genomics studies, the unigene set has permitted significant enhancement of the number of publicly-available molecular genetic markers as tools for improvement of this species.
