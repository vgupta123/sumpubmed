BACKGROUND
the transcription factor pax <dig> is essential for the development of the central nervous system and it exerts its multiple functions by regulating the expression of downstream target molecules. to screen for genes downstream of pax <dig>  we performed comprehensive transcriptome profiling analyses in the early hindbrain of pax <dig> homozygous mutant and wild-type rats using microarrays.


RESULTS
comparison of quadruplicate microarray experiments using two computational methods allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes that have relatively small fold changes or low expression levels. gene ontology analyses of the differentially expressed molecules demonstrated that pax <dig> is involved in various signal transduction pathways where it regulates the expression of many receptors, signaling molecules, transporters and transcription factors. the up- or down-regulation of these genes was further confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr. in situ staining of fabp <dig>  dbx <dig>  unc5h <dig> and cyp26b <dig> mrnas showed that expression of these transcripts not only overlapped with that of pax <dig> in the hindbrain of wild-type and pax <dig> heterozygous mutants, but also was clearly reduced in the hindbrain of the pax <dig> homozygous mutant. in addition, the pax <dig> homozygous mutant hindbrain showed that cyp26b <dig> expression was lacked in the dorsal and ventrolateral regions of rhombomeres  <dig> and  <dig>  and that the size of rhombomere  <dig> expanded rostrocaudally.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that unc5h <dig> and cyp26b <dig> are novel candidates for target genes transactivated by pax <dig>  furthermore, our results suggest the interesting possibility that pax <dig> regulates anterior-posterior patterning of the hindbrain via activation of cyp26b <dig>  an enzyme that metabolizes retinoic acid.
