BACKGROUND
cells permissive to virus can become refractory to viral replication upon intracellular expression of single chain fragment variable  antibodies directed towards viral structural or regulatory proteins, or virus-coded enzymes. for example, an intrabody derived from mh-svm <dig>  a monoclonal antibody against a conserved c-terminal epitope of the hiv- <dig> matrix protein , was found to exert an inhibitory effect on hiv- <dig> replication.


RESULTS
two versions of mh-svm33-derived scfv were constructed in recombinant baculoviruses  and expressed in bv-infected sf <dig> cells, n-myristoylation-competent scfvg2/p <dig> and n-myristoylation-incompetent scfve2/p <dig> protein, both carrying a c-terminal ha tag. scfvg2/p <dig> expression resulted in an insoluble, membrane-associated protein, whereas scfve2/p <dig> was recovered in both soluble and membrane-incorporated forms. when coexpressed with the hiv- <dig> pr55gag precursor, scfvg2/p <dig> and scfve2/p <dig> did not show any detectable negative effect on virus-like particle  assembly and egress, and both failed to be encapsidated in vlp. however, soluble scfve2/p <dig> isolated from sf <dig> cell lysates was capable of binding to its specific antigen, in the form of a synthetic p <dig> peptide or as gag polyprotein-embedded epitope. significant amounts of scfve2/p <dig> were released in the extracellular medium of bv-infected cells in high-molecular weight, pelletable form. this particulate form corresponded to bv particles displaying scfve2/p <dig> molecules, inserted into the bv envelope via the scfv n-terminal region. the bv-displayed scfve2/p <dig> molecules were found to be immunologically functional, as they reacted with the c-terminal epitope of map <dig>  fusion of the n-terminal  <dig> amino acid residues from the scfve2/p <dig> sequence  to another scfv recognizing cd <dig>  conferred the property of bv-display to the resulting chimeric scfv-n18e2/m <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
expression of scfve2/p <dig> in insect cells using a bv vector resulted in baculoviral progeny displaying scfve2/p <dig>  the function required for bv envelope incorporation was carried by the n-terminal octadecapeptide of scfve2/p <dig>  which acted as a signal peptide for bv display. fusion of this peptide to the n-terminus of scfv molecules of interest could be applied as a general method for bv-display of scfv in a gp64- and vsv-g-independent manner.
