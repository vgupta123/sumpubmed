BACKGROUND
schizophrenia is a complex brain disorder with molecular mechanisms that have yet to be elucidated. previous studies have suggested that changes in gene expression may play an important role in the etiology of schizophrenia, and that micrornas  and transcription factors  are primary regulators of this gene expression. so far, several mirna-tf mediated regulatory modules have been verified. we hypothesized that mirnas and tfs might play combinatory regulatory roles for schizophrenia genes and, thus, explored mirna-tf regulatory networks in schizophrenia.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> feed-forward loops  among our compiled schizophrenia-related mirnas, tfs and genes. our evaluation revealed that these observed ffls were significantly enriched in schizophrenia genes. by converging the ffls and mutual feedback loops, we constructed a novel mirna-tf regulatory network for schizophrenia. our analysis revealed egr <dig> and hsa-mir- <dig> were core regulators in this regulatory network. we next proposed a model highlighting egr <dig> and mirnas involved in signaling pathways and regulatory networks in the nervous system. finally, we suggested several single nucleotide polymorphisms  located on mirnas, their target sites, and tfbss, which may have an effect in schizophrenia gene regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides many insights on the regulatory mechanisms of genes involved in schizophrenia. it represents the first investigation of a mirna-tf regulatory network for a complex disease, as demonstrated in schizophrenia.
