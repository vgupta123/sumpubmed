BACKGROUND
it is widely believed that integral outer membrane  proteins in bacteria are able to diffuse laterally in the om. however, stable, immobile proteins have been identified in the om of escherichia coli. in explaining the observations, a hypothesized interaction of the immobilized om proteins with the underlying peptidoglycan  cell wall played a prominent role.


RESULTS
ompa is an abundant outer membrane protein in e. coli containing a pg-binding domain. we use frap to investigate whether ompa is able to diffuse laterally over long-range  distances in the om. first, we show that ompa, containing a pg binding domain, does not exhibit long-range lateral diffusion in the om. then, to test whether pg interaction was required for this immobilization, we genetically removed the pg binding domain and repeated the frap experiment. to our surprise, this did not increase the mobility of the protein in the om.


CONCLUSIONS
ompa exhibits an absence of long-range  diffusion in the om that is not caused by its pg binding domain. therefore, other mechanisms are needed to explain this observation, such as the presence of physical barriers in the om, or strong interactions with other elements in the cell envelope.
