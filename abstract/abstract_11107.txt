BACKGROUND
rna secondary structure prediction is a compute intensive task that lies at the core of several search algorithms in bioinformatics. fortunately, the rna folding approaches, such as the nussinov base pair maximization, involve mathematical operations over affine control loops whose iteration space can be represented by the polyhedral model. polyhedral compilation techniques have proven to be a powerful tool for optimization of dense array codes. however, classical affine loop nest transformations used with these techniques do not optimize effectively codes of dynamic programming of rna structure predictions.


RESULTS
the purpose of this paper is to present a novel approach allowing for generation of a parallel tiled nussinov rna loop nest exposing significantly higher performance than that of known related code. this effect is achieved due to improving code locality and calculation parallelization. in order to improve code locality, we apply our previously published technique of automatic loop nest tiling to all the three loops of the nussinov loop nest. this approach first forms original rectangular 3d tiles and then corrects them to establish their validity by means of applying the transitive closure of a dependence graph. to produce parallel code, we apply the loop skewing technique to a tiled nussinov loop nest.


CONCLUSIONS
the technique is implemented as a part of the publicly available polyhedral source-to-source traco compiler. generated code was run on modern intel multi-core processors and coprocessors. we present the speed-up factor of generated nussinov rna parallel code and demonstrate that it is considerably faster than related codes in which only the two outer loops of the nussinov loop nest are tiled.
