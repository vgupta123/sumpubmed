BACKGROUND
spo <dig> is a key protein for promoting meiotic recombination, by generating chromatin locus- and timing-specific dna double-strand breaks . the dsb activity of spo <dig> was shown by genetic analyses, but whether spo <dig> exerts dsb-forming activity by itself is still an unanswered question. dsb formation by spo <dig> has not been detected by biochemical means, probably because of a lack of proper protein-folding, posttranslational modifications, and/or specific spo11-interacting proteins required for this activity. in addition, plants have multiple spo11-homologues.


RESULTS
to determine whether spo <dig> can cleave dna by itself, and to identify which plant spo <dig> homologue cleaves dna, we developed a drosophila bioassay system that detects the dsb signals generated by a plant spo <dig> homologue expressed ectopically. we cytologically and genetically demonstrated the dsb activities of arabidopsis atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig>  which are required for meiosis, in the absence of other plant proteins. using this bioassay, we further found that a novel spo11-homologue, osspo11d, which has no counterpart in arabidopsis, displays prominent dsb-forming activity. quantitative analyses of the rice spo <dig> transcripts revealed the specific increase in osspo11d mrna in the anthers containing meiotic pollen mother cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the drosophila bioassay system successfully demonstrated that some plant spo <dig> orthologues have intrinsic dsb activities. furthermore, we identified a novel spo <dig> homologue, osspo11d, with robust dsb activity and a possible meiotic function.
