BACKGROUND
the present study investigated the neural correlates of sign language processing of deaf people who had learned german sign language  from their deaf parents as their first language. correct and incorrect signed sentences were presented sign by sign on a computer screen. at the end of each sentence the participants had to judge whether or not the sentence was an appropriate dgs sentence. two types of violations were introduced:  semantically incorrect sentences containing a selectional restriction violation ;  morphosyntactically incorrect sentences containing a verb that was incorrectly inflected . event-related brain potentials  were recorded from  <dig> scalp electrodes.


RESULTS
semantic violations  elicited an n <dig> effect followed by a positivity. sentences with a morphosyntactic violation  elicited a negativity followed by a broad centro-parietal positivity.


CONCLUSIONS
erp correlates of semantic and morphosyntactic aspects of dgs clearly differed from each other and showed a number of similarities with those observed in other signed and oral languages. these data suggest a similar functional organization of signed and oral languages despite the visual-spacial modality of sign language.
