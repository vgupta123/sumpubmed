BACKGROUND
the barley-puccinia hordei  pathosystem is a model for investigating partial disease resistance in crop plants and genetic mapping of phenotypic resistance has identified several quantitative trait loci  for partial resistance. reciprocal qtl-specific near-isogenic lines  have been developed that combine two qtl, rphq <dig> and rphq <dig>  the largest effects detected in a recombinant-inbred-line  population derived from a cross between the super-susceptible line l <dig> and partially-resistant line vada. the molecular mechanism underpinning partial resistance in these qtl-nils is unknown.


RESULTS
an agilent custom microarray consisting of  <dig>  probes derived from barley consensus est sequences was used to investigate genome-wide and qtl-specific differential expression of genes  <dig> hours post-inoculation  with puccinia hordei. a total of  <dig>  genes were identified as being significantly differentially expressed across the genome, of which  <dig> were accounted for by the genetic differences defined by qtl-nils at rphq <dig> and rphq <dig>  these genes were predominantly located at the qtl regions and are, therefore, positional candidates. one gene, encoding the transcriptional repressor ethylene-responsive element binding factor  <dig>  was located outside the qtl at  <dig> cm on chromosome 1h, within a previously detected eqtl hotspot for defence response. the results indicate that rphq <dig> or rphq <dig> contains a trans-eqtl that modulates expression of hverf <dig>  we speculate that hverf <dig> functions as an intermediate that conveys the response signal from a gene contained within rphq <dig> or rphq <dig> to a host of down-stream defense responsive genes. our results also reveal that barley lines with extreme or intermediate partial resistance phenotypes exhibit a profound similarity in their spectrum of ph-responsive genes and that hormone-related signalling pathways are actively involved in response to puccinia hordei.


CONCLUSIONS
differential gene expression between qtl-nils identifies genes predominantly located within the target region providing both transcriptional and positional candidate genes for the qtl. genetically mapping the differentially expressed genes relative to the qtl has the potential to discover trans-eqtl mediated regulatory relays initiated from genes within the qtl regions.
