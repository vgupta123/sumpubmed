BACKGROUND
over the last decade, cholera outbreaks in parts of kenya have become common. although a number of recent studies describe the epidemiology of cholera in kenya, there is paucity of information concerning the diversity and occurrence of mobile genetic elements in vibrio cholerae strains implicated in these outbreaks. a total of  <dig> vibrio cholerae o <dig> el tor serotype inaba isolated between  <dig> and  <dig> from various outbreaks in kenya were investigated for mobile genetic elements including integrons, transposons, the integrating conjugative elements , conjugative plasmids and for their genotypic relatedness.


RESULTS
all the strains were haemolytic on 5% sheep blood and positive for the vibrio cholerae el tor-specific haemolysin toxin gene  by pcr. they all contained strb, sulii, flor and the dfra <dig> genes encoding resistance to streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim respectively. these genes, together with an ice belonging to the sxt/r <dig> family were transferable to the rifampicin-resistant e. coli c <dig> en bloc. all the strains were negative for integron class  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and for transposase gene of transposon tn <dig> but were positive for integron class  <dig> and the trpm gene of transposon tn <dig>  no plasmids were isolated from any of the  <dig> strains. all the strains were also positive for all v. cholera el tor pathogenic genes except the nag- specific heat-stable toxin  gene. none of the strains were positive for virulence genes associated with the v. cholerae classical biotype. all the strains were positive for el tor-specific ctxphi bacteriophage rstrr repressor gene  but negative for the classical, calcutta, and the environmental repressor types. pulse field gel electrophoresis  showed that regardless of the year of isolation, all the strains bearing the sxt element were clonally related.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that the v. cholerae o <dig> strains carrying an sxt/r391-like element implicated in recent cholera outbreaks in kenya has not changed significantly between  <dig> and  <dig> and are clonally related.
