BACKGROUND
offgel isoelectric focussing  has become a popular tool in proteomics to fractionate peptides or proteins. as a consequence there is a need for software solutions supporting data mining, interpretation and characterisation of experimental quality.


RESULTS
we can assess performance characteristics of offgel ief peptide fractionation in proteomics by generating plots of the overall fractionation patterns and the pairwise comparisons of adjacent fractions.


CONCLUSIONS
a visualisation tool for peptide fractionation has been developed to support the evaluation of ief data quality and can be implemented in proteomics research.
