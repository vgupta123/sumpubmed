BACKGROUND
kr√ºppel-like factors  are critical regulators of biological and physiological systems and have been extensively studied for their roles in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival in the context of cancer. among the klfs, klf <dig> is highly expressed in human breast cancers and plays an oncogenic role. the present study examined the expression of klf <dig> and assessed its significance in canine mammary carcinoma.


RESULTS
immunohistochemistry was employed to investigate the expression of klf <dig> in  <dig> cases of canine mammary tumor.  <dig> of the  <dig>  cases were histologically confirmed as mammary carcinoma. quantification of immunohistochemistry was carried out using quick score which multiply the staining intensity by the percentage of positive cells. high klf <dig> expression was identified in  <dig> of the  <dig>  dogs with mammary carcinoma and none in the benign cases. high klf <dig> expression occurred only in the tumor cells and not the adjacent normal cells in mammary carcinoma . moreover, the high expression level of klf <dig> expression was statistically associated with poor grade, late stage, histological subtypes of simple and complex carcinoma, and shorter 24-month survival. the kaplan-meier survival analysis also indicated that dogs with high nuclear klf <dig> expression had a significantly shorter survival than those with low/moderate klf <dig> expression .


CONCLUSIONS
klf <dig> is highly and frequently expressed in canine mammary carcinoma and correlates with a more aggressive phenotype.
