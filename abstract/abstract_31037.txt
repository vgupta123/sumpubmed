BACKGROUND
ctla- <dig> functions primarily as an inhibitor of t cell activation. there are several candidate explanations as to how ctla- <dig> modulates t cell responses, but the exact mechanism remains undefined. the tail of ctla- <dig> does not have any intrinsic enzymatic activity but is able to associate with several signaling molecules including the serine/threonine phosphatase pp2a. pp2a is a heterotrimeric molecule comprised of a regulatory b subunit associated with a core dimer of a scaffolding  and a catalytic  subunit.


RESULTS
here, we performed an analysis of the human ctla- <dig> interface interacting with pp2a. we show that pp2a interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of ctla- <dig> in two different sites, one on the lysine rich motif, and the other on the tyrosine residue located at position  <dig> . although the interaction between ctla- <dig> and pp2a was not required for inhibition of t cell responses, it was important for t cell activation by inverse agonists of ctla- <dig>  such an interaction was functionally relevant because the inverse agonists induced il- <dig> production in an okadaic acid-dependent manner.


CONCLUSIONS
our studies demonstrate that pp2a interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of human ctla- <dig> through two motifs, the lysine rich motif centered at lysine  <dig> and the tyrosine residue  <dig>  this interaction and the phosphatase activity of pp2a are important for ctla-4-mediated t cell activation.
