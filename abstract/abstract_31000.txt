BACKGROUND
annually, influenza a viruses circulate the world causing wide-spread sickness, economic loss, and death. one way to better defend against influenza virus-induced disease may be to develop novel host-based therapies, targeted at mitigating viral pathogenesis through the management of virus-dysregulated host functions. however, mechanisms that govern aberrant host responses to influenza virus infection remain incompletely understood. we previously showed that the pandemic h1n <dig> virus influenza a/california/04/ <dig>  has enhanced pathogenicity in the lungs of cynomolgus macaques relative to a seasonal influenza virus isolate ).


RESULTS
here, we used microarrays to identify host gene sequences that were highly differentially expressed  in ca04-infected macaque lungs, and we employed a novel strategy – combining functional and pathway enrichment analyses, transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction data – to create a ca <dig> differentially regulated host response network. this network describes enhanced viral rna sensing, immune cell signaling and cell cycle arrest in ca04-infected lungs, and highlights a novel, putative role for the myc-associated zinc finger  transcription factor in regulating these processes.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that the enhanced pathology is the result of a prolonged immune response, despite successful virus clearance. most interesting, we identify a mechanism which normally suppresses immune cell signaling and inflammation is ineffective in the ph1n <dig> virus infection; a dyregulatory event also associated with arthritis. this dysregulation offers several opportunities for developing strain-independent, immunomodulatory therapies to protect against future pandemics.
