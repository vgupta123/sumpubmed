BACKGROUND
transposable elements  are a rapidly evolving fraction of the eukaryotic genomes and the main contributors to genome plasticity and divergence. recently, occupation of the a- and d-genomes of allopolyploid wheat by specific te families was demonstrated. here, we investigated the impact of the well-represented family of gypsy ltr-retrotransposons, fatima, on b-genome divergence of allopolyploid wheat using the fluorescent in situ hybridisation  method and phylogenetic analysis.


RESULTS
fish analysis of a bac clone  initially screened with spelt <dig> repeats demonstrated its predominant localisation to chromosomes of the b-genome and its putative diploid progenitor aegilops speltoides in hexaploid  and tetraploid  wheats as well as their diploid progenitors. analysis of the complete bac_2383a <dig> nucleotide sequence  demonstrated that it contains  <dig> % tes,  <dig> % subtelomeric tandem repeats , and five genes. ltr retrotransposons are predominant, representing  <dig> % of the total nucleotide sequence. three elements of the gypsy ltr retrotransposon family fatima make up  <dig> % of all the ltr retrotransposons in this bac. in situ hybridisation of the fatima_2383a24- <dig> subclone suggests that individual representatives of the fatima family contribute to the majority of the b-genome specific fish pattern for bac_2383a <dig>  phylogenetic analysis of various fatima elements available from databases in combination with the data on their insertion dates demonstrated that the fatima elements fall into several groups. one of these groups, containing fatima_2383a24- <dig>  is more specific to the b-genome and proliferated around  <dig> - <dig>  mya, prior to allopolyploid wheat formation.


CONCLUSIONS
the b-genome specificity of the gypsy-like fatima, as determined by fish, is explained to a great degree by the appearance of a genome-specific element within this family for ae. speltoides. moreover, its proliferation mainly occurred in this diploid species before it entered into allopolyploidy.

most likely, this scenario of emergence and proliferation of the genome-specific variants of retroelements, mainly in the diploid species, is characteristic of the evolution of all three genomes of hexaploid wheat.
