BACKGROUND
across species, diversity at the major histocompatibility complex  is critical to disease resistance and population health; however, use of mhc diversity to quantify the genetic health of populations has been hampered by the extreme variation found in mhc genes. next generation sequencing  technology generates sufficient data to genotype even the most diverse species, but workflows for distinguishing artifacts from alleles are still under development. we used ngs to evaluate the mhc diversity of over  <dig> captive and wild ring-tailed lemurs . we modified a published workflow to address errors that arise from deep sequencing individuals and tested for evidence of selection at the most diverse mhc genes.


RESULTS
in addition to evaluating the accuracy of  <dig> titanium and ion torrent pgm for genotyping large populations at hypervariable genes, we suggested modifications to improve current methods of allele calling. using these modifications, we genotyped  <dig> out of  <dig> individuals, obtaining an average sequencing depth of over  <dig> reads per amplicon. we identified  <dig> mhc-drb alleles,  <dig> of which were previously undescribed, and provide the first sequences of five additional mhc genes: doa, dob, dpa, dqa, and dra. the additional five mhc genes had one or two alleles each with little sequence variation; however, the  <dig> mhc-drb alleles showed a high dn/ds ratio and trans-species polymorphism, indicating a history of positive selection. because each individual possessed 1– <dig> mhc-drb alleles, we suggest that ring-tailed lemurs have four, putatively functional, mhc-drb copies.


CONCLUSIONS
in the future, accurate genotyping methods for ngs data will be critical to assessing genetic variation in non-model species. we recommend that future ngs studies increase the proportion of replicated samples, both within and across platforms, particularly for hypervariable genes like the mhc. quantifying mhc diversity within non-model species is the first step to assessing the relationship of genetic diversity at functional loci to individual fitness and population viability. owing to mhc-drb diversity and copy number, ring-tailed lemurs may serve as an ideal model for estimating the interaction between genetic diversity, fitness, and environment, especially regarding endangered species.
