BACKGROUND
extracellular domains of the notch family of signalling receptors contain many egf repeat domains, as do their major ligands. some egf repeats are modified by o-fucosylation, and most have no identified role in ligand binding.


RESULTS
using a binding assay with purified proteins in vitro, it was determined that, in addition to binding to delta, the ligand binding region of notch bound to egf repeats 22– <dig> of notch, but not to other egf repeat regions of notch. egf repeats 22– <dig> of drosophila notch overlap the genetically-defined 'abruptex' region, and competed with delta for binding to proteins containing the ligand-binding domain. delta differed from the abruptex domain in showing markedly enhanced binding at acid ph. both delta and the abruptex region are heavily modified by protein o-fucosylation, but the split mutation of drosophila notch, which affects o-fucosylation of egf repeat  <dig>  did not affect binding of notch to either delta or the abruptex region.


CONCLUSIONS
the abruptex region may serve as a barrier to notch activation by competing for the ligand-binding domain of notch.
