BACKGROUND
t cell receptors  can recognize diverse lipid and metabolite antigens presented by mhc-like molecules cd <dig> and mr <dig>  and the molecular basis of many of these interactions has not been determined. here we applied our protein docking algorithm tcrflexdock, previously developed to perform docking of tcrs to peptide-mhc  molecules, to predict the binding of αβ and γδ tcrs to cd <dig> and mr <dig>  starting with the structures of the unbound molecules.


RESULTS
evaluating against tcr-cd1d complexes with crystal structures, we achieved near-native structures in the top  <dig> models for two out of four cases, and an acceptable-rated prediction for a third case. we also predicted the structure of an interaction between a mait tcr and mr1-antigen that has not been structurally characterized, yielding a top-ranked model that agreed remarkably with a characterized tcr-mr1-antigen structure that has a nearly identical tcr α chain but a different β chain, highlighting the likely dominance of the conserved α chain in mr1-antigen recognition. docking performance was improved by re-training our scoring function with a set of tcr-pmhc complexes, and for a case with an outlier binding mode, we found that alternative docking start positions improved predictive accuracy. we then performed unbound docking with two mycolyl-lipid specific tcrs that recognize lipid-bound cd1b, which represent a class of interactions that is not structurally characterized. highly-ranked models of these complexes showed remarkable agreement between their binding topologies, as expected based on their shared germline sequences, while differences in residue-level interactions with their respective antigens point to possible mechanisms underlying their distinct specificities.


CONCLUSIONS
together these results indicate that flexible docking simulations can provide accurate models and atomic-level insights into tcr recognition of mhc-like molecules presenting lipid and other small molecule antigens.
