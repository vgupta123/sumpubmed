BACKGROUND
trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei is a bat-associated parasite of the subgenus schizotrypanum and it is regarded as a t. cruzi subspecies. here we report a draft genome sequence of t. c. marinkellei and comparison with t. c. cruzi. our aims were to identify unique sequences and genomic features, which may relate to their distinct niches.


RESULTS
the t. c. marinkellei genome was found to be ~11% smaller than that of the human-derived parasite t. c. cruzi sylvio x <dig>  the genome size difference was attributed to copy number variation of coding and non-coding sequences. the sequence divergence in coding regions was ~ <dig> % between t. c. marinkellei and t. c. cruzi sylvio x <dig>  a unique acetyltransferase gene was identified in t. c. marinkellei, representing an example of a horizontal gene transfer from eukaryote to eukaryote. six of eight examined gene families were expanded in t. c. cruzi sylvio x <dig>  the dgf gene family was expanded in t. c. marinkellei. t. c. cruzi sylvio x <dig> contained ~ <dig>  fold more sequences related to viper and l1tc elements. experimental infections of mammalian cell lines indicated that t. c. marinkellei has the capacity to invade non-bat cells and undergo intracellular replication.


CONCLUSIONS
several unique sequences were identified in the comparison, including a potential subspecies-specific gene acquisition in t. c. marinkellei. the identified differences reflect the distinct evolutionary trajectories of these parasites and represent targets for functional investigation.
