BACKGROUND
the globe artichoke  is a significant crop in the mediterranean basin. despite its commercial importance and its both dietary and pharmaceutical value, knowledge of its genetics and genomics remains scant. microsatellite markers have become a key tool in genetic and genomic analysis, and we have exploited recently acquired est  sequence data  to develop an extensive set of microsatellite markers.


RESULTS
a unigene assembly was created from over  <dig>  globe artichoke est sequences, containing  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. over  <dig>  of these unigenes were functionally assigned on the basis of homology with arabidopsis thaliana reference proteins. a total of  <dig>  perfect repeats, located within  <dig>  unigenes was identified and the gene ontology  analysis highlighted some go term's enrichments among different classes of microsatellites with respect to their position. sufficient flanking sequence was available to enable the design of primers to amplify  <dig>  of these microsatellites, and a set of  <dig> was tested against a dna panel derived from  <dig> c. cardunculus genotypes. consistent amplification and polymorphism was obtained from  <dig> of these assays. their polymorphic information content  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . between  <dig> and  <dig> of the assays were informative in at least one of the three available mapping populations.


CONCLUSIONS
est-based microsatellites have provided a large set of de novo genetic markers, which show significant amounts of polymorphism both between and within the three taxa of c. cardunculus. they are thus well suited as assays for phylogenetic analysis, the construction of genetic maps, marker-assisted breeding, transcript mapping and other genomic applications in the species.
