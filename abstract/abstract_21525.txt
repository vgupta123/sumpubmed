BACKGROUND
flax  is an important source of oil rich in omega- <dig> fatty acids, which have proven health benefits and utility as an industrial raw material. flax seeds also contain lignans which are associated with reducing the risk of certain types of cancer. its bast fibres have broad industrial applications. however, genomic tools needed for molecular breeding were non existent. hence a project, total utilization flax genomics  was initiated. we report here the first genome-wide physical map of flax and the generation and analysis of bac-end sequences  from  <dig>  clones, providing initial insights into the genome.


RESULTS
the physical map consists of  <dig> contigs spanning ~ <dig> mb, assembled from  <dig>  fingerprints, representing roughly  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the estimated haploid genome . the n <dig> size of the contigs was estimated to be ~ <dig>  kb. the longest contig was ~ <dig>  kb comprising  <dig> clones. there were  <dig> contigs containing more than  <dig> clones. approximately  <dig>  mb representing 8- <dig> % of the genome was obtained from  <dig>  bes. annotation revealed that a large part of the genome consists of ribosomal dna , followed by known transposable elements at  <dig> %. furthermore, ~ <dig> % of sequence was identified to harbour novel repeat elements. homology searches against flax-ests and ncbi-ests suggested that ~ <dig> % of the transcriptome is unique to flax. a total of  <dig> putative genomic ssrs were identified and are being developed as novel markers for their use in molecular breeding.


CONCLUSIONS
the first genome-wide physical map of flax constructed with bac clones provides a framework for accessing target loci with economic importance for marker development and positional cloning. analysis of the bes has provided insights into the uniqueness of the flax genome. compared to other plant genomes, the proportion of rdna was found to be very high whereas the proportion of known transposable elements was low. the ssrs identified from bes will be valuable in saturating existing linkage maps and for anchoring physical and genetic maps. the physical map and paired-end reads from bac clones will also serve as scaffolds to build and validate the whole genome shotgun assembly.
