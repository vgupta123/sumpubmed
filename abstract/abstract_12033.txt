BACKGROUND
a significant barrier to organ transplantation is the cellular rejection that occurs and mediated by antibodies, t cells, and innate immune cells. this study was aimed to determine the number of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ treg, cd4+ifn-γ−il-17+ th <dig>  cd4+ifn-γ+il-17− th <dig> and cd4+ifn-γ+il-17+ th1/ <dig> cells in renal transplant recipients .

methods
renal transplantation was performed for a total of  <dig> patients with end-stage renal failure. the number of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ treg, cd4+ifn-γ−il-17+ th <dig>  cd4+ifn-γ+il-17− th <dig> and cd4+ifn-γ+il-17+ th1/ <dig> cells, and the serum level of ifn-γ, tnf-α, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> were measured in pre- and post-transplant patients and  <dig> healthy controls  using flow cytometry and cytometric bead array . the association between the number of different subsets of cd4+ t-cells and clinical parameters were analyzed among the pre- and post-transplant patients, and the healthy controls.


RESULTS
the number of cd4+ifn-γ−il-17+ th <dig>  cd4+ifn-γ+il-17− th <dig> and cd4+ifn-γ+il-17+ th1/ <dig> cells were significantly increased in patients with end-stage renal failure  compared to the hc. stratification analysis indicated that amr , ar  and cr  groups displayed greater number of cd4+ifn-γ−il-17+ th <dig>  cd4+ifn-γ+il-17− th <dig> and cd4+ifn-γ+il-17+ th1/ <dig> cells as well as high level of serum il- <dig>  ifn-γ, tnf-α and il- <dig>  but, the amr, ar and cr groups have shown lower level of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ t cells and serum il- <dig> compared to transplant stable  patients. moreover, the number of tregs were negatively correlated with the number of th <dig> cells in rtr patients. the number of tregs and th <dig> cells were positively correlated with the egfr and serum creatinine values, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the imbalance between different types of cd4+ t cells and dysregulated inflammatory cytokines may contribute towards renal transplantation rejection.
