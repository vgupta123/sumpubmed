BACKGROUND
the presence of homoeologous sequences and absence of a reference genome sequence make discovery and genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms  more challenging in polyploid crops.


RESULTS
to address this challenge, we constructed reduced representation libraries  for two brassica napus inbred lines and their  <dig> doubled haploid  progenies using a modified ddradseq technique. a bioinformatics pipeline termed rfaptools was developed to discover and genotype snps and presence/absence variations . using this pipeline, a pseudo-reference sequence  containing  <dig>  sequence tags was constructed. by aligning sequence reads to the pseudo-reference sequence, allelic snps as well as pavs were identified and genotyped with rfaptools. two parallel linkage maps, one snp bin map containing  <dig>  snp loci and one pav linkage map containing  <dig>  dominant loci, were constructed. by aligning marker sequences to b. rapa sequence scaffolds, whose genome is available, we assigned  <dig> unassembled sequence scaffolds comprising  <dig> Â mb onto the b. rapa chromosomes, and also identified  <dig> instances of misassembly and eight instances of mis-ordering sequence scaffolds.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that the modified ddradseq approach is a cost-effective and simple method to genotype tens of thousands snps and pav markers in a polyploidy plant species. the results also demonstrated that rfaptools developed in this study are powerful to mine allelic snps from homoeologous sequences in polyploids, therefore they are generally applicable in either diploid or polyploid species with or without a reference genome sequence.
