BACKGROUND
rice is an important staple food and, with the smallest cereal genome, serves as a reference species for studies on the evolution of cereals and other grasses. therefore, decoding its entire genome will be a prerequisite for applied and basic research on this species and all other cereals.


RESULTS
we have determined and analyzed the complete sequences of two of its chromosomes,  <dig> and  <dig>  which total  <dig>  mb , based on a set of overlapping clones. a total of  <dig>  non-transposable element related genes are present on these chromosomes. among them are  <dig> disease resistance-like and  <dig> defense-response genes, a higher proportion of these categories than on any other rice chromosome. a three-mb segment on both chromosomes resulted from a duplication  <dig>  million years ago , the most recent large-scale duplication in the rice genome. paralogous gene copies within this segmental duplication can be aligned with genomic assemblies from sorghum and maize. although these gene copies are preserved on both chromosomes, their expression patterns have diverged. when the gene order of rice chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> was compared to wheat gene loci, significant synteny between these orthologous regions was detected, illustrating the presence of conserved genes alternating with recently evolved genes.


CONCLUSIONS
because the resistance and defense response genes, enriched on these chromosomes relative to the whole genome, also occur in clusters, they provide a preferred target for breeding durable disease resistance in rice and the isolation of their allelic variants. the recent duplication of a large chromosomal segment coupled with the high density of disease resistance gene clusters makes this the most recently evolved part of the rice genome. based on syntenic alignments of these chromosomes, rice chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> do not appear to have resulted from a single whole-genome duplication event as previously suggested.
