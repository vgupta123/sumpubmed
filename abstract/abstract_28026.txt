BACKGROUND
a great deal of effort and expense are being expended internationally in attempts to detect genetic polymorphisms contributing to susceptibility to complex human disease. techniques such as linkage disequilibrium mapping are being increasingly used to examine and compare markers across increasingly large datasets. visualisation techniques are becoming essential to analyse the ever-growing volume of data and results available with any given analysis.


RESULTS
jlin  is a software package designed for customisable, intuitive visualisation of linkage disequilibrium  across all common computing platforms. customisation allows the user to choose particular visualisations, statistical measures and measurement ranges. jlin also allows the user to export images of the ld visualisation in several common document formats.


CONCLUSIONS
jlin allows the user to visually compare and contrast the results of a range of statistical measures on the input dataset. these measures include the commonly used d' and r <dig> statistics and empirical p-values. jlin has a number of unique and novel features that improve on existing ld visualisation tools.
