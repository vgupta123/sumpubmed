BACKGROUND
conjugation is a major type of horizontal transmission of genes that involves transfer of a plasmid into a recipient using specific conjugation machinery, which results in an extended spectrum of bacterial antibiotics resistance. however, there is inadequate knowledge about the regulator and mechanisms that control the conjugation processes, especially in an aquaculture environment where a cocktail of antibiotics may be present. here, we investigated these with peib <dig>  a typical multi-drug resistant incp plasmid encoding tetracycline, streptomycin, sulfonamide and chloramphenicol resistance in fish pathogen edwardsiella piscicida strain eib <dig> 


RESULTS
we used transposon insertion sequencing  to identify genes that are responsible for conjugation transfer of peib <dig>  all ten of the plasmid-borne type iv secretion system  genes and a putative lipoprotein p <dig> were identified to play an important role in peib <dig> horizontal transfer. antibiotics appear to modulate conjugation frequencies by repressing t4ss gene expression. in addition, we identified topa gene, which encodes topoisomerase i, as an inhibitor of peib <dig> transfer. furthermore, the rna-seq analysis of the response regulator esrb encoded on the chromosome also revealed its essential role in facilitating the conjugation by upregulating the t4ss genes.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our screens unraveled the genetic basis of the conjugation transfer of peib <dig> and the influence of horizontally acquired esrb on this process. our results will improve the understanding of the mechanism of plasmid conjugation processes that facilitate dissemination of antibiotic resistance especially in aquaculture industries.
