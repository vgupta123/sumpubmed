BACKGROUND
histone modifications play an integral role in plant development, but have been poorly studied in woody plants. investigating chromatin organization in wood-forming tissue and its role in regulating gene expression allows us to understand the mechanisms underlying cellular differentiation during xylogenesis  and identify novel functional regions in plant genomes. however, woody tissue poses unique challenges for using high-throughput chromatin immunoprecipitation  techniques for studying genome-wide histone modifications in vivo. we investigated the role of the modified histone h3k4me <dig>  in gene expression during the early stages of wood formation using chip-seq in eucalyptus grandis, a woody biomass model.


RESULTS
plant chromatin fixation and isolation protocols were optimized for developing xylem tissue collected from field-grown e. grandis trees. a “nano-chip-seq” procedure was employed for chip dna amplification. over  <dig> million h3k4me <dig> chip-seq and  <dig> million control paired-end reads were mapped to the e. grandis reference genome for peak-calling using model-based analysis of chip-seq. the  <dig>  significant h3k4me <dig> peaks identified covered ~ <dig> % of the genome and overlapped some  <dig>  protein-coding genes and  <dig> noncoding rnas. h3k4me <dig> library coverage, peaking ~ <dig> -  <dig> bp downstream of the transcription start site, was highly correlated with gene expression levels measured with rna-seq. overall, h3k4me3-enriched genes tended to be less tissue-specific than unenriched genes and were overrepresented for general cellular metabolism and development gene ontology terms. relative expression of h3k4me3-enriched genes in developing secondary xylem was higher than unenriched genes, however, and highly expressed secondary cell wall-related genes were enriched for h3k4me <dig> as validated using chip-qpcr.


CONCLUSIONS
in this first genome-wide analysis of a modified histone in a woody tissue, we optimized a chip-seq procedure suitable for field-collected samples. in developing e. grandis xylem, h3k4me <dig> enrichment is an indicator of active transcription, consistent with its known role in sustaining pre-initiation complex formation in yeast. the h3k4me <dig> chip-seq data from this study paves the way to understanding the chromatin landscape and epigenomic architecture of xylogenesis in plants, and complements rna-seq evidence of gene expression for the future improvement of the e. grandis genome annotation.
