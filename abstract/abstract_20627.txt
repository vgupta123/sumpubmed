BACKGROUND
increasing age, several co-morbidities, environmental contamination, antibiotic exposure and other intestinal perturbations appear to be the greatest risk factors for c. difficile infection . therefore, elderly care home residents are considered particularly vulnerable to the infection. the main objective of this study was to evaluate and follow the prevalence of c. difficile in  <dig> elderly care home residents weekly during a 4-month period. a c. difficile microbiological detection scheme was performed along with an overall microbial biodiversity study of the faeces content by 16s rrna gene analysis.


RESULTS
seven out of  <dig>  residents were  positive for c. difficile. c. difficile was detected in  <dig> out of  <dig> diarrhoeal samples . the most common pcr-ribotype identified was  <dig>  mlva showed that there was a clonal dissemination of c. difficile strains within the nursing home residents. 16s-profiling analyses revealed that each resident has his own bacterial imprint, which was stable during the entire study. significant changes were observed in c. difficile positive individuals in the relative abundance of a few bacterial populations, including lachnospiraceae and verrucomicrobiaceae. a decrease of akkermansia in positive subjects to the bacterium was repeatedly found.


CONCLUSIONS
a high c. difficile colonisation in nursing home residents was found, with a predominance of the hypervirulent pcr-ribotype  <dig>  positive c. difficile status is not associated with microbiota richness or biodiversity reduction in this study. the link between akkermansia, gut inflammation and c. difficile colonisation merits further investigations.
