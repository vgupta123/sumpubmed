BACKGROUND
mycobacterium abscessus complex, the third most frequent mycobacterial complex responsible for community- and health care-associated infections in developed countries, comprises of m. abscessus subsp. abscessus and m. abscessus subsp. bolletii reviously referred as mycobacterium bolletii and mycobacterium massiliense. the diversity of this group of opportunistic pathogens is poorly described.


RESULTS
in-depth analysis of  <dig> published m. abscessus complex genomes found a pan-genome of  <dig>  proteins and core-genome of  <dig>   proteins, indicating a non-conservative genome. analysing the average percentage of amino-acid sequence identity  discriminates three main clusters c <dig>  c <dig> and c3: c <dig> comprises strains belonging to m. abscessus, c <dig> comprises strains belonging to m. massiliense and c <dig> comprises strains belonging to m. bolletii; and two sub-clusters in clusters c <dig> and c <dig>  the phylogenomic network confirms these three clusters. the genome length  varies from  <dig> -mb in c <dig>   <dig> -mb in c2a,  <dig> -mb in c2b and  <dig> -mb in c <dig>  the mean number of prophage regions  is  <dig> in c1;  <dig>  in c2a;  <dig>  in c2b and five in c <dig>  a total of  <dig> genes are uniquely present in c <dig>   <dig> in c <dig> and  <dig> in c <dig>  these genes could be used for the detection and identification of organisms in each cluster. further, the mean number of host-interaction factors  varies from  <dig> in cluster c <dig>   <dig> in cluster c2a,  <dig> in cluster c2b and  <dig> in clusters c3a and c3b. no significant differences in antibiotic resistance genes were observed between clusters, in contrast to previously reported in-vitro patterns of drug resistance. they encode both penicillin-binding proteins targeted by β-lactam antibiotics and an ambler class a β-lactamase for which inhibitors exist.


CONCLUSIONS
our comparative analysis indicates that m. abscessus complex comprises three genomospecies, corresponding to m. abscessus, m. bolletii, and m. massiliense. the genomics data here reported indicate differences in virulence of medical interest; and suggest targets for the refined detection and identification of m. abscessus.
