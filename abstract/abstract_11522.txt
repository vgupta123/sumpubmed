BACKGROUND
nucleosomes are the basic structural units of eukaryotic chromatin, and they play a significant role in regulating gene expression. specific dna sequence patterns are known, from empirical and theoretical studies, to influence dna bending and flexibility, and have been shown to exclude nucleosomes. a whole genome localization of these patterns, and their analysis, can add important insights on the gene regulation mechanisms that depend upon the structure of chromatin in and around a gene.


RESULTS
a whole genome annotation for nucleosome exclusion regions  was carried out on the human genome. nucleosome exclusion scores  were calculated individually for each nucleotide, giving a measure of how likely a specific nucleotide and its immediate neighborhood would impair dna bending and, consequently, exclude nucleosomes. the resulting annotations were correlated with  <dig> gene expression profiles. we developed a new method based on grubbs' outliers test for ranking genes based on their tissue specificity, and correlated this ranking with nxscores. the results show a strong correlation between tissue specificity of a gene and the propensity of its promoter to exclude nucleosomes . in addition, nxscores correlated well with gene density, gene expression levels, and dnasei hypersensitive sites.


CONCLUSIONS
we present, for the first time, a whole genome prediction of nucleosome exclusion regions for the human genome . nucleosome exclusion patterns are correlated with various factors that regulate gene expression, which emphasizes the need to include chromatin structural parameters in experimental analysis of gene expression.
