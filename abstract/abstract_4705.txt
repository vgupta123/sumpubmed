BACKGROUND
tapping panel dryness  involves in the partial or complete cessation of latex flow thus seriously affect latex production in rubber tree . numerous studies have been conducted to define its origin and nature, but the molecular nature and mechanism of tpd occurrence remains unknown. this study is committed to de novo sequencing and comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of healthy  and tpd-affected  rubber trees to identify the genes and pathways related to the tpd.


RESULTS
total raw reads of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> ,020 bp were obtained from h and t library, respectively using illumina hiseq  <dig> sequencing technology. de novo assemblies yielded  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes from h and t library, respectively.

among  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes were identified as differential expressed genes between h and t library via comparative transcript profiling. a majority of genes involved in natural rubber biosynthesis and jasmonate synthesis with most potential relevance in tpd occurrence were found to be differentially expressed.


CONCLUSIONS
in tpd-affected trees, the expression of most genes related to the latex biosynthesis and jasmonate synthesis was severely inhibited and is probably the direct cause of the tpd. these new de novo transcriptome data sets provide a significant resource for the discovery of genes related to tpd and improve our understanding of the occurrence and maintainace of tpd.
