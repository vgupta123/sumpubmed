BACKGROUND
biomedical information and knowledge, structural and non-structural, stored in different repositories can be semantically connected to form a hybrid knowledge network. how to compute relatedness between concepts and discover valuable but implicit information or knowledge from it effectively and efficiently is of paramount importance for precision medicine, and a major challenge facing the biomedical research community.


RESULTS
in this study, a hybrid biomedical knowledge network is constructed by linking concepts across multiple biomedical ontologies as well as non-structural biomedical knowledge sources. to discover implicit relatedness between concepts in ontologies for which potentially valuable relationships  may exist, we developed a multi-ontology relatedness model  within the knowledge network, for which a relatedness network  is defined and computed across multiple ontologies using a formal inference mechanism of set-theoretic operations. semantic constraints are designed and implemented to prune the search space of the relatedness network.


CONCLUSIONS
experiments to test examples of several biomedical applications have been carried out, and the evaluation of the results showed an encouraging potential of the proposed approach to biomedical knowledge discovery.
