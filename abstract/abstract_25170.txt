BACKGROUND
while the body axis is largely patterned along the anterior-posterior  axis during gastrulation, the central nervous system  shows dynamic changes in the expression pattern of hox genes during neurulation, suggesting that the cns refines the a-p pattern continuously after neural tube formation. this study aims at clarifying the role of somites in up-regulating hoxb <dig> expression to eventually establish its final pattern and how the neural tube develops a competence to respond to extrinsic signals.


RESULTS
we show that somites are required for the up-regulation of hoxb <dig> in the neural tube at the level of somites  <dig> to  <dig>  the anterior-most domain of expression. however, each somite immediately adjacent to the neural tube is not sufficient at each level; planar signaling is additionally required particularly at the anterior-most segments of the expression domain. we also show that the dorsal side of the neural tube has a greater susceptibility to expressing hoxb <dig> than the ventral region, a feature associated with dorsalization of the neural tube by bmp signals. bmp <dig> is additionally able to up-regulate hoxb <dig> ventrally, but the effect is restricted to the axial levels at which hoxb <dig> is normally expressed, and only in the presence of retinoic acid  or somites, suggesting a role for bmp in rendering the neural tube competent to express hoxb <dig> in response to ra or somite signals.


CONCLUSIONS
in identifying the collaboration between somites and neural tube competence in the induction of hoxb <dig>  this study demonstrates interplay between a-p and dorsal-ventral  patterning systems, whereby a specific feature of d-v polarity may be a prerequisite for proper a-p patterning by hox genes.
