BACKGROUND
bread wheat, one of the world’s staple food crops, has the largest, highly repetitive and polyploid genome among the cereal crops. the wheat genome holds the key to crop genetic improvement against challenges such as climate change, environmental degradation, and water scarcity. to unravel the complex wheat genome, the international wheat genome sequencing consortium  is pursuing a chromosome- and chromosome arm-based approach to physical mapping and sequencing. here we report on the use of a bac library made from flow-sorted telosomic chromosome 3a short arm  for marker development and analysis of sequence composition and comparative evolution of homoeologous genomes of hexaploid wheat.


RESULTS
the end-sequencing of  <dig>  random bacs from a chromosome arm 3as-specific library  generated  <dig> ,359 bp of high quality sequence from  <dig>  bac-ends with an average length of 626 bp. the sequence represents  <dig> % of t3as with an average dna sequence read every 19 kb. overall, 79% of the sequence consisted of repetitive elements,  <dig> % as coding regions  and another 19% of unknown origin. comparative sequence analysis suggested that 70-77% of the genes present in both 3a and 3b were syntenic with model species. among the transposable elements, gypsy/sabrina  was the most abundant repeat and was significantly more frequent in 3a compared to homoeologous chromosome 3b. twenty novel repetitive sequences were also identified using de novo repeat identification. bess were screened to identify simple sequence repeats  and transposable element junctions. a total of  <dig>  ssrs were identified with a density of one per  <dig>  kb, and  <dig>  junctions between transposable elements  and other sequences were identified with a density of one per  <dig>  kb. with the objective of enhancing the marker density of chromosome 3as, oligonucleotide primers were successfully designed from  <dig> ssrs and  <dig> insertion site based polymorphisms . of the  <dig> isbp primer pairs tested,  <dig>  were 3a-specific and compared to  <dig>  for  <dig> ssrs.


CONCLUSIONS
this work reports on the use of wheat chromosome arm 3as-specific bac library for the targeted generation of sequence data from a particular region of the huge genome of wheat. a large quantity of sequences were generated from the a genome of hexaploid wheat for comparative genome analysis with homoeologous b and d genomes and other model grass genomes. hundreds of molecular markers were developed from the 3as arm-specific sequences; these and other sequences will be useful in gene discovery and physical mapping.
