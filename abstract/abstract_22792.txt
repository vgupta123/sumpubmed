BACKGROUND
rhizobium tropici ciat  <dig> and rhizobium sp. prf  <dig> are Î±-proteobacteria that establish nitrogen-fixing symbioses with a range of legume hosts. these strains are broadly used in commercial inoculants for application to common bean  in south america and africa. both strains display intrinsic resistance to several abiotic stressful conditions such as low soil ph and high temperatures, which are common in tropical environments, and to several antimicrobials, including pesticides. the genetic determinants of these interesting characteristics remain largely unknown.


RESULTS
genome sequencing revealed that ciat  <dig> and prf  <dig> share a highly-conserved symbiotic plasmid  that is present also in rhizobium leucaenae cfn  <dig>  a rhizobium displaying a similar host range. this psym seems to have arisen by a co-integration event between two replicons. remarkably, three distinct noda genes were found in the psym, a characteristic that may contribute to the broad host range of these rhizobia. genes for biosynthesis and modulation of plant-hormone levels were also identified in the psym. analysis of genes involved in stress response showed that ciat  <dig> and prf  <dig> are well equipped to cope with low ph, high temperatures and also with oxidative and osmotic stresses. interestingly, the genomes of ciat  <dig> and prf  <dig> had large numbers of genes encoding drug-efflux systems, which may explain their high resistance to antimicrobials. genome analysis also revealed a wide array of traits that may allow these strains to be successful rhizosphere colonizers, including surface polysaccharides, uptake transporters and catabolic enzymes for nutrients, diverse iron-acquisition systems, cell wall-degrading enzymes, type i and iv pili, and novel t1ss and t5ss secreted adhesins.


CONCLUSIONS
availability of the complete genome sequences of ciat  <dig> and prf  <dig> may be exploited in further efforts to understand the interaction of tropical rhizobia with common bean and other legume hosts.
