BACKGROUND
polyamines such as spermine and spermidine are required for growth of escherichia coli; they interact with nucleic acids, and they bind to ribosomes. polyamines block porins and decrease membrane permeability, activities that may protect cells in acid. at high concentrations, however, polyamines impair growth. they impair growth more severely at high ph, probably due to their increased uptake as membrane-permeant weak bases. the role of ph is critical in understanding polyamine stress.


RESULTS
the effect of polyamines was tested on survival of escherichia coli k- <dig> w <dig> in extreme acid or base . at ph  <dig>   <dig> mm spermine increased survival by 2-fold, and putrescine increased survival by 30%. at ph  <dig> , however, e. coli survival was decreased 100-fold by  <dig> mm spermine, putrescine, cadaverine, or spermidine. at ph  <dig> , spermine decreased the growth rate substantially, whereas little effect was seen at ph  <dig> . spermidine required ten-fold higher concentrations to impair growth. on proteomic 2-d gels, spermine and spermidine caused differential expression of  <dig> different proteins. during log-phase growth at ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm spermine induced eight proteins, including pykf, glpk, sers, dead, ompc and ompf. proteins repressed included acetate-inducible enzymes  as well as rapa , and fabb. at ph  <dig> , spermine induced additional proteins: tnaa, ompa, yrda and nana  and also repressed  <dig> proteins. four of the proteins that spermine induced  and five that were repressed  show similar induction or repression, respectively, in base compared to acid. most of these base stress proteins were also regulated by spermidine, but only at ten-fold higher concentration  at high ph .


CONCLUSIONS
polyamines increase survival in extreme acid, but decrease e. coli survival in extreme base. growth inhibition by spermine and spermidine requires neutral or higher ph. at or above ph  <dig>  spermine and spermidine regulate specific proteins, many of which are known to be regulated by base stress. high ph amplifies polyamine stress; and naturally occurring polyamines may play an important role in base stress.
