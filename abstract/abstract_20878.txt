BACKGROUND
metabolic pathway analysis has been recognized as a central approach to the structural analysis of metabolic networks. the concept of elementary  modes provides a rigorous formalism to describe and assess pathways and has proven to be valuable for many applications. however, computing elementary modes is a hard computational task. in recent years we assisted in a multiplication of algorithms dedicated to it. we require a summarizing point of view and a continued improvement of the current methods.


RESULTS
we show that computing the set of elementary modes is equivalent to computing the set of extreme rays of a convex cone. this standard mathematical representation provides a unified framework that encompasses the most prominent algorithmic methods that compute elementary modes and allows a clear comparison between them. taking lessons from this benchmark, we here introduce a new method, the binary approach, which computes the elementary modes as binary patterns of participating reactions from which the respective stoichiometric coefficients can be computed in a post-processing step. we implemented the binary approach in fluxanalyzer  <dig> , a software that is free for academics. the binary approach decreases the memory demand up to 96% without loss of speed giving the most efficient method available for computing elementary modes to date.


CONCLUSIONS
the equivalence between elementary modes and extreme ray computations offers opportunities for employing tools from polyhedral computation for metabolic pathway analysis. the new binary approach introduced herein was derived from this general theoretical framework and facilitates the computation of elementary modes in considerably larger networks.
