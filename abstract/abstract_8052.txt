BACKGROUND
the association of specific bioactive flavonoids and terpenoids with fluoride can modulate the development of cariogenic biofilms by simultaneously affecting the synthesis of exopolysaccharides  and acid production by streptococcus mutans, which enhanced the cariostatic effectiveness of fluoride in vivo. in the present study, we further investigated whether the biological actions of combinations of myricetin , tt-farnesol  and fluoride can influence the expression of specific genes of s. mutans within biofilms and their structural organization using real-time pcr and confocal fluorescence microscopy.


RESULTS
twice-daily treatment  during biofilm formation affected the gene expression by s. mutans both at early  and later  stages of biofilm development. biofilms treated with combination of agents displayed lower mrna levels for gtfb and gtfd  and agud  than those treated with vehicle-control . furthermore, treatment with combination of agents markedly affected the structure-architecture of s. mutans biofilms by reducing the biovolume  and proportions of both eps and bacterial cells across the biofilm depth, especially in the middle and outer layers . the biofilms treated with combination of agents were also less acidogenic, and had reduced amounts of extracellular insoluble glucans and intracellular polysaccharides than vehicle-treated biofilms .


CONCLUSIONS
the data show that the combination of naturally-occurring agents with fluoride effectively disrupted the expression of specific virulence genes, structural organization and accumulation of s. mutans biofilms, which may explain the enhanced cariostatic effect of our chemotherapeutic approach.
