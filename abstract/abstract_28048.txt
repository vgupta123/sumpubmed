BACKGROUND
creatine  is synthesized by a two-step mechanism involving arginine:glycine amidinotransferase  and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase , and is taken up by cells through a specific cr transporter, ct <dig>  recently, genetic defects of this pathway have been described, that lead to cr deficiency, neurological symptoms in early infancy and severe neurodevelopmental delay. to investigate the involvement of cr synthesis and uptake pathways during embryonic development, we determined the spatiotemporal expression of agat, gamt and ct <dig> during the rat embryogenesis, at the mrna and protein level.


RESULTS
we show that agat and gamt are expressed in hepatic primordium as soon as  <dig>  days, then progressively acquire their adult pattern of expression, with high levels of agat in kidney and pancreas, and high levels of gamt in liver and pancreas. agat and ct <dig> are prominent in cns, skeletal muscles and intestine, where they appear earlier than gamt. high levels of ct <dig> are found in epithelia.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that de novo synthesis of cr by agat and gamt, as well as cellular cr uptake by ct <dig>  are essential during embryonic development. this work provides new clues on how creatine can be provided to developing tissues, and suggests that cr deficiencies might induce irreversible damages already in utero, particularly on the nervous system.
