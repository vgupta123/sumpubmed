BACKGROUND
listeria monocytogenes  can cause invasive diseases in humans and farm animals and is frequently isolated from dairy products and poultry. listeriosis is uncommon in china but l. monocytogenes  has been isolated from foods and food processing environments in china. however little is known of genetic diversity of chinese l. monocytogenes  isolates and their relationships with global isolates.


RESULTS
two hundred and twelve isolates of l. monocytogenes  from food sources from  <dig> provinces/cities in china were analysed by serotyping, pulsed field gel electrophoresis  and multi-locus sequence typing . the predominant serotypes are 1/2a, 1/2b and 1/2c accounting for  <dig> % of the isolates. pfge divided the isolates into  <dig> pulse types . twenty nine pts were represented by more than one isolates with pt gx6a <dig>  containing the most number of isolates. mlst differentiated the isolates into  <dig> sts, among which  <dig> were novel. the  <dig> most common sts were st <dig> , st <dig>  and st <dig> , accounting for  <dig> % of the isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
sts prevalent in other parts of the world are also prevalent in china including  <dig> sts  which caused maternal fetal infections or outbreaks, suggesting that these sts potentially can also cause severe human infections or outbreaks in china. surveillance of these sts will provide important information for prevention of listeriosis. this study also enhances our understanding of genetic diversity of l. monocytogenes  in china.
