BACKGROUND
pectins are diverse and very complex biomolecules and their structure depends on the plant species and tissue. it was previously shown that derivatives of pectic polymers and oligosaccharides from pectins have positive effects on human health. to obtain specific pectic oligosaccharides, highly defined enzymatic mixes are required. filamentous fungi are specialized in plant cell wall degradation and some produce a broad range of pectinases. they may therefore shed light on the enzyme mixes needed for partial hydrolysis.


RESULTS
the growth profiles of  <dig> fungi on four pectins and four structural elements of pectins show that the presence/absence of pectinolytic genes in the fungal genome clearly correlates with their ability to degrade pectins. however, this correlation is less clear when we zoom in to the pectic structural elements.


CONCLUSIONS
this study highlights the complexity of the mechanisms involved in fungal degradation of complex carbon sources such as pectins. mining genomes and comparative genomics are promising first steps towards the production of specific pectinolytic fractions.
