BACKGROUND
high-resolution tandem mass spectra can now be readily acquired with hybrid instruments, such as ltq-orbitrap and ltq-ft, in high-throughput shotgun proteomics workflows. the improved spectral quality enables more accurate de novo sequencing for identification of post-translational modifications and amino acid polymorphisms.


RESULTS
in this study, a new de novo sequencing algorithm, called vonode, has been developed specifically for analysis of such high-resolution tandem mass spectra. to fully exploit the high mass accuracy of these spectra, a unique scoring system is proposed to evaluate sequence tags based primarily on mass accuracy information of fragment ions. consensus sequence tags were inferred for  <dig>  spectra with an average peptide length of  <dig>  residues from a total of  <dig>  input spectra acquired in a 24-hour proteomics measurement of rhodopseudomonas palustris. the accuracy of inferred consensus sequence tags was 84%. according to our comparison, the performance of vonode was shown to be superior to the pepnovo v <dig>  algorithm, in terms of the number of de novo sequenced spectra and the sequencing accuracy.


CONCLUSIONS
here, we improved de novo sequencing performance by developing a new algorithm specifically for high-resolution tandem mass spectral data. the vonode algorithm is freely available for download at http://compbio.ornl.gov/vonode.
