BACKGROUND
tight junctions are an intercellular adhesion complex of epithelial and endothelial cells, and form a paracellular barrier that restricts the diffusion of solutes on the basis of size and charge. tight junctions are formed by multiprotein complexes containing cytosolic and transmembrane proteins. how these components work together to form functional tight junctions is still not well understood and will require a complete understanding of the molecular composition of the junction.


RESULTS
here we identify a new transmembrane component of tight junctions: marveld <dig>  a four-span transmembrane protein. its predicted transmembrane helices form a marvel  domain, a structural motif originally discovered in proteins involved in membrane apposition and fusion events, such as the tight junction proteins occludin and tricellulin. in mammals, marveld <dig> is expressed as two alternatively spliced isoforms. both isoforms exhibit a broad tissue distribution and are expressed by different types of epithelial as well as endothelial cells. marveld <dig> co-localises with occludin at tight junctions in intestinal and corneal epithelial cells. rna interference experiments in caco- <dig> cells indicate that normal marveld <dig> expression is not required for the formation of functional tight junctions but depletion results in monolayers with increased transepithelial electrical resistance.


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that marveld <dig> is a third member of the tight junction-associated occludin family of transmembrane proteins. similar to occludin, normal expression of marveld <dig> is not essential for the formation of functional tight junctions. however, marveld <dig> functions as a determinant of epithelial paracellular permeability properties.
