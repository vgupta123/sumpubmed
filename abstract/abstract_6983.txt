BACKGROUND
grain texture is one of the most important characteristics in bread wheat . puroindoline-d <dig> genes play the main role in controlling grain texture and are intimately associated with the milling and processing qualities in bread wheat.


RESULTS
a series of diagnostic molecular markers and dcaps markers were used to characterize pina-d <dig> and pinb-d <dig> in  <dig> wheat cultivars from diverse geographic locations. a primer walking strategy was used to characterize pina-null alleles at the dna level. results indicated that chinese landraces encompassing  <dig> different puroindoline-d <dig> allelic combinations showed the highest diversity, while cimmyt wheat cultivars containing  <dig> different puroindoline-d <dig> allelic combinations showed the lowest diversity amongst wheat cultivars from the five countries surveyed. two novel pina-d <dig> alleles, designated pina-d1s with a  <dig> -bp deletion and pina-d1u with a  <dig> -bp deletion in the ha  locus, were characterized at the dna level by a primer walking strategy, and corresponding molecular markers pina-n <dig> and pina-n <dig> were developed for straightforward identification of the pina-d1s and pina-d1u alleles. analysis of the association of puroindoline-d <dig> alleles with grain texture indicated that wheat cultivars with pina-null/pinb-null allele, possessing an approximate 33-kb deletion in the ha locus, have the highest skcs hardness index amongst the different genotypes used in this study. moreover, wheat cultivars with the pina-null allele have significantly higher skcs hardness index than those of pinb-d1b and pinb-d1p alleles.


CONCLUSIONS
molecular characterization of the puroindoline-d <dig> allele was investigated in bread wheat cultivars from five geographic regions, resulting in the discovery of two new alleles - pina-d1s and pina-d1u. molecular markers were developed for both alleles. analysis of the association of the puroindoline-d <dig> alleles with grain texture showed that cultivars with pina-null allele possessed relatively high skcs hardness index. this study can provide useful information for the improvement of wheat quality, as well as give a deeper understanding of the molecular and genetic processes controlling grain texture in bread wheat.
