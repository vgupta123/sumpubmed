BACKGROUND
phage display technology is a powerful new tool for making antibodies outside the immune system, thus avoiding the use of experimental animals. in the early days, it was postulated that this technique would eventually replace hybridoma technology and animal immunisations. however, since this technology emerged more than  <dig> years ago, there have only been a handful reports on the construction and application of phage display antibody libraries world-wide.


RESULTS
here we report the simplest and highly efficient method for the construction of a highly useful human single chain variable fragment  library. the least number of oligonucleotide primers, electroporations and ligation reactions were used to generate a library of  <dig>  ×  <dig> individual clones, without generation of sub-libraries. all possible combinations of heavy and light chains, among all immunoglobulin isotypes, were included by using a mixture of primers and overlapping extension pcr. the key difference from other similar libraries was the highest diversity of variable gene repertoires, which was derived from  <dig> non-immunized human donors. a wide variety of antigens were successfully used to affinity select specific binders. these included pure recombinant proteins, a hapten and complex antigens such as viral coat proteins, crude snake venom and cancer cell surface antigens. in particular, we were able to use standard bio-panning method to isolate antibody that can bind to soluble aflatoxin b <dig>  when using bsa-conjugated toxin as a target, as demonstrated by inhibition elisa.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggested that by using an optimized protocol and very high repertoire diversity, a compact and efficient phage antibody library can be generated. this advanced method could be adopted by any molecular biology laboratory to generate both naïve or immunized libraries for particular targets as well as for high-throughput applications.
