BACKGROUND
genome-wide association studies  identify regions of the genome that are associated with particular traits, but do not typically identify specific causative genetic elements. for example, while a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes  and related traits have been identified by human gwas, only a few genes have functional evidence to support or to rule out a role in cellular metabolism or dietary interactions. here, we use a recently developed drosophila model in which high-sucrose feeding induces phenotypes similar to t2d to assess orthologs of human gwas-identified candidate genes for risk of t2d and related traits.


RESULTS
disrupting orthologs of certain t2d candidate genes  led to sucrose-dependent toxicity. tissue-specific knockdown of the hhex ortholog dhhex  directed metabolic defects and enhanced lethality; for example, fat-body-specific loss of dhhex led to increased hemolymph glucose and reduced insulin sensitivity.


CONCLUSIONS
candidate genes identified in human genetic studies of metabolic traits can be prioritized and functionally characterized using a simple drosophila approach. to our knowledge, this is the first large-scale effort to study the functional interaction between gwas-identified candidate genes and an environmental risk factor such as diet in a model organism system.
