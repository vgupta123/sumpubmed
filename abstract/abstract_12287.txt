BACKGROUND
tristetraprolin  is a key mediator of processes such as inflammation resolution, the inhibition of autoimmunity and in cancer. it carries out this role by the binding and degradation of mrna transcripts, thereby decreasing their half-life. transcripts modulated by ttp encode proteins such as cytokines, pro-inflammatory agents and immediate-early response proteins. ttp can also modulate neoplastic phenotypes in many cancers. ttp is induced and functionally regulated by a spectrum of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, mitogens and drugs in a mapk-dependent manner. so far the contribution of p <dig> mapk to the regulation of ttp expression and function has been best described.


RESULTS
our results demonstrate the induction of the gene coding ttp  by egf through the erk1/2-dependent pathway and implicates the transcription factor elk- <dig> in this process. we show that elk- <dig> regulates zfp <dig> expression by two mechanisms: by binding the zfp <dig> promoter directly through ets-binding site  and by inducing expression of egr- <dig>  which in turn increases zfp <dig> expression through sequences located between - <dig> and - <dig> bp.


CONCLUSIONS
egf activates ttp expression via elk- <dig> and egr- <dig> transcription factors.
