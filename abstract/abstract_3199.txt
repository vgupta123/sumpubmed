BACKGROUND
the colonial cyanobacterium microcystis proliferates in a wide range of freshwater ecosystems and is exposed to changing environmental factors during its life cycle. microcystis blooms are often toxic, potentially fatal to animals and humans, and may cause environmental problems. there has been little investigation of the genomics of these cyanobacteria.


RESULTS
deciphering the  <dig> , <dig> bp sequence of microcystis aeruginosa pcc  <dig> has revealed the high plasticity of its genome:  <dig> % dna repeats containing more than  <dig>  bases,  <dig> % putative transposases and  <dig> putative restriction enzymes. compared to the genomes of other cyanobacterial lineages, strain pcc  <dig> contains a large number of atypical genes that may have been acquired by lateral transfers. metabolic pathways, such as fermentation and a methionine salvage pathway, have been identified, as have genes for programmed cell death that may be related to the rapid disappearance of microcystis blooms in nature. analysis of the pcc  <dig> genome also reveals striking novel biosynthetic features that might help to elucidate the ecological impact of secondary metabolites and lead to the discovery of novel metabolites for new biotechnological applications. m. aeruginosa and other large cyanobacterial genomes exhibit a rapid loss of synteny in contrast to other microbial genomes.


CONCLUSIONS
microcystis aeruginosa pcc  <dig> appears to have adopted an evolutionary strategy relying on unusual genome plasticity to adapt to eutrophic freshwater ecosystems, a property shared by another strain of m. aeruginosa . comparisons of the genomes of pcc  <dig> and other cyanobacterial strains indicate that a similar strategy may have also been used by the marine strain crocosphaera watsonii wh <dig> to adapt to other ecological niches, such as oligotrophic open oceans.
