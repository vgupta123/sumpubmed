BACKGROUND
due to an abundance of repetitive dna, the annotation of heterochromatic regions of the genome such as the y chromosome is problematic. the y chromosome is involved in key biological functions such as male-fertility and sex-determination and hence, accurate identification of its sequences is vital. the hemipteran insect rhodnius prolixus is an important vector of chagas disease, a trypanosomiasis affecting 6– <dig> million people worldwide. here we report the identification of the first y-linked genes of this species.


RESULTS
the r. prolixus genome was recently sequenced using separate libraries for each sex and the sequences assembled only with male reads are candidates for y linkage. we found  <dig> such candidates and pcr tests with the ten largest ones, confirmed y-linkage for all of them, suggesting that "separate libraries" is a reliable method for the identification of y-linked sequences. blast analyses of the  <dig> candidate scaffolds revealed that  <dig> scaffolds contained genes or part of putative genes. we tested y-linkage for  <dig> candidates and found that nine of them are y-linked . hence, we describe in this study, for the first time, y-linked genes in the r. prolixus genome: two zinc finger proteins , one metalloproteinase , one aconitase/iron regulatory protein  and five genes devoid of matches in any database . expression profile studies revealed that eight genes are expressed mainly in adult testis , while aco-y has a gut-restricted expression.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study we showed that the approach used for the r. prolixus genome project  is key to easy and fast identification of sex-specific . the nine new r. prolixus y-linked genes reported here provide unique markers for population and phylogenetic analysis and further functional studies of these genes may answer some questions about sex determination, male fertility and y chromosome evolution in this important species.
