BACKGROUND
regulated expression of suicide genes is a powerful tool to eliminate specific subsets of cells and will find widespread usage in both basic and applied science. a promising example is the specific elimination of human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  infected cells by ltr-driven suicide genes. the success of this approach, however, depends on a fast and effective suicide gene, which is expressed exclusively in hiv- <dig> infected cells. these preconditions have not yet been completely fulfilled and, thus, success of suicide approaches has been limited so far. we tested truncated bid , a human pro-apoptotic protein that induces apoptosis very rapidly and efficiently, as suicide gene for gene therapy against hiv- <dig> infection.


RESULTS
when tbid was introduced into the hiv- <dig> ltr-based, tat- and rev-dependent transgene expression vector plred2r, very efficient induction of apoptosis was observed within  <dig> hours, but only in the presence of both hiv- <dig> regulatory proteins tat and rev. induction of apoptosis was not observed in their absence. cells containing this vector rapidly died when transfected with plasmids containing full-length viral genomic dna, completely eliminating the chance for hiv- <dig> replication. viral replication was also strongly reduced when cells were infected with hiv- <dig> particles.


CONCLUSIONS
this suicide vector has the potential to establish a safe and effective gene therapy approach to exclusively eliminate hiv- <dig> infected cells before infectious virus particles are released.
