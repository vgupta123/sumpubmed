BACKGROUND
the m-aaa  is an evolutionary conserved metalloprotease complex located in the internal mitochondrial membrane. in the mouse, it is a hetero-oligomer variably formed by the spg <dig>  afg3l <dig>  and afg3l <dig> encoded proteins, or a homo-oligomer formed by either afg3l <dig> or afg3l <dig>  in humans, afg3l <dig> and spg <dig> genes are conserved, whereas afg3l <dig> became a pseudogene. both afg3l <dig> and spg <dig> are involved in a neurodegenerative disease, namely the autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia sca <dig> and a recessive form of spastic paraplegia, respectively.


RESULTS
using quantitative rt-pcr, we measured the expression levels of spg <dig>  afg3l <dig>  and afg3l <dig> in the mouse brain. in all regions afg3l <dig> is the most abundant transcript, followed by spg <dig>  and afg3l <dig>  with a ratio of approximately 5:3: <dig> in whole-brain mrna. using in-situ hybridization, we showed that spg <dig>  afg3l <dig> and afg3l <dig> have a similar cellular pattern of expression, with high levels in mitral cells, purkinje cells, deep cerebellar nuclei cells, neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons, and brainstem motor neurons. however, in some neuronal types, differences in the level of expression of these genes were present, suggesting distinct degrees of contribution of their proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
neurons involved in sca <dig> and hereditary spastic paraplegia display high levels of expression, but similar or even higher expression is also present in other types of neurons, not involved in these diseases, suggesting that the selective cell sensitivity should be attributed to other, still unknown, mechanisms.
