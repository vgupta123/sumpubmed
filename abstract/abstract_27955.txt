BACKGROUND
recent studies suggested that human/mammalian genomes are divided into large, discrete domains that are units of chromosome organization. ctcf, a ccctc binding factor, has a diverse role in genome regulation including transcriptional regulation, chromosome-boundary insulation, dna replication, and chromatin packaging. it remains unclear whether a subset of ctcf binding sites plays a functional role in establishing/maintaining chromatin topological domains.


RESULTS
we systematically analysed the genomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles of the ctcf binding sites in  <dig> human cell lines from encode. we identified ~ <dig>  ctcf sites  that were bound in more than 90% of the cell lines. our analysis revealed: 1) constitutive ctcf loci were located in constitutive open chromatin and often co-localized with constitutive cohesin loci; 2) most constitutive ctcf loci were distant from transcription start sites and lacked cpg islands but were enriched with the full-spectrum ctcf motifs: a recently reported 33/34-mer and two other potentially novel ; 3) more importantly, most constitutive ctcf loci were present in ctcf-mediated chromatin interactions detected by chia-pet and these pair-wise interactions occurred predominantly within, but not between, topological domains identified by hi-c.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that the constitutive ctcf sites may play a role in organizing/maintaining the recently identified topological domains that are common across most human cells.
