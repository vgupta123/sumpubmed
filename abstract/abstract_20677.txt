BACKGROUND
the availability of specific markers expressed in different regions of the developing nervous system provides a useful tool for the study of mouse mutants. one such marker, the transcription factor pax <dig>  is expressed at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary and in the cerebellum, spinal cord, retina, optic stalk, and optic chiasm. we recently described a group of diencephalic cells that express pax <dig> as early as embryonic day   <dig> , and become part of the eminentia thalami by e <dig> . the discovery of this previously undescribed cell population prompted us to examine pax <dig> protein expression in the developing mouse forebrain in more detail.


RESULTS
we determined the expression pattern of pax <dig> in the forebrain of wild type mouse embryos between e <dig>  and postnatal day   <dig>  pax <dig> expression was detected in the septum of the basal forebrain, hypothalamus, eminentia thalami and in the subfornical organ. to evaluate pax <dig> as a marker for septal cells, we examined pax <dig> expression in pax6sey/sey mutants, which have an enlarged septum. we found that pax <dig> clearly marks a population of septal cells equivalent to that seen in wild types, indicating its utility as a marker of septal identity. these cells did not express the gabaergic marker calbindin nor the cholinergic marker choline acetyltransferase and were not detectable after p <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
pax <dig> is expressed in populations of cells within the developing septum, hypothalamus, and eminentia thalami. it seems especially useful as a marker of the telencephalic septum, because of its early, strong and characteristic expression in this structure. further, its expression is maintained in the enlarged septum of pax6sey/sey mutants.
