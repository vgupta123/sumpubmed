BACKGROUND
although the ciona intestinalis genome contains many allelic polymorphisms, there is only limited data analyzed systematically. establishing a dense map of genetic variations in c. intestinalis is necessary not only for linkage analysis, but also for other experimental biology including molecular developmental and evolutionary studies, because animals from natural populations are typically used for experiments.


RESULTS
here, we identified over three million candidate short genomic variations within a  <dig> mb euchromatin region among five c. intestinalis individuals. the average nucleotide diversity was approximately  <dig> %. genetic variations were found at a similar density in intergenic and gene regions. non-synonymous and nonsense nucleotide substitutions were found in  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the entire gene set, respectively, and over 60% of genes in the single animal encode non-identical proteins between maternal and paternal alleles.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide a framework for studying evolution of the animal genome, as well as a useful resource for a wide range of c. intestinalis researchers.
