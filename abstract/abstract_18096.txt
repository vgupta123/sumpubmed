BACKGROUND
several genotyping protocols have been described to study candida albicans strains with different sensitivity values. in this study we have analyzed the genetic relatedness and the antifungal susceptibility of several candida albicans strains isolated from a patient who from suffered recurrent candiduria for a period of five years. strains were genotyped using microsatellite length polymorphism  with three microsatellite markers , and a new method based on high resolution melting  was developed to analyze the microsatellite region. this method was compared with the conventional technique that uses capillary electrophoresis.


RESULTS
mics of the isolates showed the existence of fluconazole susceptible and resistant strains. an inter-colony test using single concentration  of fluconazole revealed the coexistence of both fluconazole susceptible and resistant strains. both genotyping analysis methods showed that all the patientâ€™s isolates had a clonal origin. hrm analysis method developed was able to accurately establish strain relatedness and presented a discriminatory power of  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
although hrm analysis method presented a lower discriminatory power compared to methods based on capillary electrophoresis, it provided a more cost-effective and suitable alternative for genotyping c. albicans in a clinical laboratory.
