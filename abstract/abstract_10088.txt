BACKGROUND
attenuation of the egfr  signalling cascade is crucial to control cell fate during development. a candidate-based rnai approach in c. elegans identified cdt- <dig> as an attenuator of let- <dig>  signalling. human cdt <dig> is a component of the conserved cdt2/cul4/ddb <dig> ubiquitin ligase complex that plays a critical role in dna replication and g2/m checkpoint. within this complex, cdt <dig> is responsible for substrate recognition. this ubiquitin ligase complex has been shown in various organisms, including c. elegans, to target the replication-licensing factor cdt <dig>  and the cdk inhibitor p <dig>  however, no previous link to egfr signalling has been identified.


RESULTS
we have characterised cdt-2's role during vulva development and found that it is a novel attenuator of let- <dig> signalling. cdt- <dig> acts redundantly with negative modulators of let- <dig> signalling and cdt- <dig> or cul- <dig> downregulation causes persistent expression of the egl-17::cfp transgene, a marker of let- <dig> signalling during vulva development. in addition, we show that cdt- <dig> physically interacts with sem- <dig> , a known negative modulator of let- <dig> signalling that directly binds let- <dig>  and provide genetic evidence consistent with cdt- <dig> functioning at or downstream of let- <dig>  interestingly, both sem- <dig> and cdt- <dig> were identified independently in a screen for genes involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis in oocytes, suggesting that attenuation of let- <dig> by cdt- <dig> might be through regulation of endocytosis.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have shown that cdt- <dig> and cul- <dig>  members of the cul-4/ddb-1/cdt- <dig> e <dig> ubiquitin ligase complex attenuate let- <dig> signalling in vulval precursor cells. in future, it will be interesting to investigate the potential link to endocytosis and to determine whether other signalling pathways dependent on endocytosis, e.g. lin- <dig>  could be regulated by this ubiquitin ligase complex. this work has uncovered a novel function for the cul-4/ddb-1/cdt- <dig> e <dig> ligase that may be relevant for its mammalian oncogenic activity.
