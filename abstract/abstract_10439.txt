BACKGROUND
heat shock protein  <dig>  is a molecular chaperone that is considered a new target for the treatment of cancer. increasing data reveal an extracellular chaperoning activity for hsp <dig>  here we investigate the interaction of the secreted isoforms of hsp <dig> with matrix metalloproteinases  mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  moreover we examine the role of a monoclonal antibody  against hsp <dig>  mab 4c <dig>  regarding these interactions and its value as a potential inhibitor of human breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis.


RESULTS
our results showed that both hsp90α and hsp90β are secreted by mdamb <dig> human breast cancer cells and interact with mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  mab 4c <dig>  while not affecting the secretion of inactive mmps, inhibits their activation by disrupting their interaction extracellularly with both isoforms of hsp <dig>  the in vivo studies revealed that mab 4c <dig> significantly inhibits the metastatic deposit formation of mdamb <dig> cells into the lungs of scid mice.


CONCLUSIONS
both isoforms of hsp <dig> are secreted by mdamb <dig> cells and interact with mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  mab 4c <dig> prevents mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> activation, by disrupting their interaction with hsp <dig>  finally mab 4c <dig> significantly inhibits the metastatic deposit formation of mdamb <dig> cells, by preventing their extravasation and infiltration in the lung tissue and therefore it could be used as a potential therapeutic agent for cancer metastasis.
