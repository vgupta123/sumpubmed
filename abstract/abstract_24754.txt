BACKGROUND
the formation of an allopolyploid is a two step process, comprising an initial wide hybridization event, which is later followed by a whole genome doubling. both processes can affect the transcription of homoeologues. here, rna-seq was used to obtain the genome-wide leaf transcriptome of two independent triticum turgidum × aegilops tauschii allotriploids , along with their spontaneous allohexaploids  and their parental lines. the resulting sequence data were then used to characterize variation in homoeologue transcript abundance.


RESULTS
the hybridization event strongly down-regulated d-subgenome homoeologues, but this effect was in many cases reversed by whole genome doubling. the suppression of d-subgenome homoeologue transcription resulted in a marked frequency of parental transcription level dominance, especially with respect to genes encoding proteins involved in photosynthesis. singletons  were frequently transcribed at both the allotriploid and allohexaploid plants.


CONCLUSIONS
the implication is that whole genome doubling helps to overcome the phenotypic weakness of the allotriploid, restoring a more favourable gene dosage in genes experiencing transcription level dominance in hexaploid wheat.
