BACKGROUND
over the last few years, continuous development of high-throughput sequencing platforms and sequence analysis tools has facilitated reliable identification and characterization of genetic variants in many cattle breeds. deep sequencing of entire genomes within a cattle breed that has not been thoroughly investigated would be imagined to discover functional variants that are underlying phenotypic differences. here, we sequenced to a high coverage the danish holstein cattle breed to detect and characterize single nucleotide polymorphisms , insertion/deletions , and loss-of-function  variants in protein-coding genes in order to provide a comprehensive resource for subsequent detection of causal variants for recessive traits.


RESULTS
we sequenced four genetically unrelated danish holstein cows with a mean coverage of 27x using an illumina hiseq  <dig>  multi-sample snp calling identified  <dig> , <dig> snps and  <dig> , <dig> indels whereof  <dig>   snps and  <dig>   indels were novel. a comparison between sequencing-derived snps and genotyping from the bovinehd beadchip revealed a concordance rate of  <dig> – <dig>  % for homozygous snps and  <dig> – <dig>  % for heterozygous snps. annotation of the snps discovered  <dig>  snps and  <dig> indels affecting coding sequences with  <dig> being lof mutations. the frequency of lof variants differed greatly across the genome, a hot spot with a strikingly high density was observed in a 6 mb region on bta <dig>  lof affected genes were enriched for functional categories related to olfactory reception and underrepresented for genes related to key cellular constituents and cellular and biological process regulation. filtering using sequence derived genotype data for  <dig> holstein animals from the  <dig> bull genomes project removing variants containing homozygous individuals retained  <dig> of the lof variants as putatively deleterious. a substantial number of the putative deleterious lof variants had a minor allele frequency > <dig>  in the  <dig> bull genomes data set.


CONCLUSIONS
deep sequencing of danish holstein genomes enabled us to identify  <dig>  million variants. an investigation into lof variants discovered a set of variants predicted to disrupt protein-coding genes. this catalog of variants will be a resource for future studies to understand variation underlying important phenotypes, particularly recessively inherited lethal phenotypes.
