BACKGROUND
an interesting seed protein family with a role in preventing insect herbivory is the multi-gene, apa family encoding the Î±-amylase inhibitor, phytohemagglutinin and arcelin proteins of common bean . variability for this gene family exists and has been exploited to breed for insect resistance. for example, the arcelin locus has been successfully transferred from wild to cultivated common bean genotypes to provide resistance against the bruchid species zabrotes subfasciatus although the process has been hampered by a lack of genetic tools for and understanding about the locus. in this study, we analyzed linkage disequilibrium  between microsatellite markers at the apa locus and bruchid resistance in a germplasm survey of  <dig> resistant and susceptible genotypes and compared this with ld in other parts of the genome.


RESULTS
microsatellite allele diversity was found to vary with each of the eight apa-linked markers analyzed, and two markers within the apa locus were found to be diagnostic for bruchid resistance or susceptibility and for the different arcelin alleles inherited from the wild accessions. arc <dig> was found to provide higher levels of resistance than arc <dig> and the markers in the apa locus were highly associated with resistance showing that introgression of this gene-family from wild beans provides resistance in cultivated beans. ld around the apa locus was found to be intermediate compared to other regions of the genome and the highest ld was found within the apa locus itself for example between the markers pv-atct <dig> and pv-ag <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we found the apa locus to be an important genetic determinant of bruchid resistance and also found that ld existed mostly within the apa locus but not beyond it. moderate ld was also found for some other regions of the genome perhaps related to domestication genes. the ld pattern may reflect the introgression of arcelin from the wild into the cultivated background through breeding. ld and association studies for the arcelin gene, linked genes and other members of the apa family are essential for breaking linkage drag while maintaining high levels of bruchid resistance in common bean.
