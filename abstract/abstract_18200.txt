BACKGROUND
one of the main types of genetic variations in cancer is copy number variations . whole exome sequenicng  is a popular alternative to whole genome sequencing  to study disease specific genomic variations. however, finding cnv in cancer samples using wes data has not been fully explored.


RESULTS
we present a new method, called convex, to estimate copy number variation in whole exome sequencing data. it uses ratio of tumour and matched normal average read depths at each exonic region, to predict the copy gain or loss. the useful signal produced by wes data will be hindered by the intrinsic noise present in the data itself. this limits its capacity to be used as a highly reliable cnv detection source. here, we propose a method that consists of discrete wavelet transform  to reduce noise. the identification of copy number gains/losses of each targeted region is performed by a hidden markov model .


CONCLUSIONS
hmm is frequently used to identify cnv in data produced by various technologies including array comparative genomic hybridization  and wgs. here, we propose an hmm to detect cnv in cancer exome data. we used modified data from  <dig> genomes project to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. using these data we have shown that convex outperforms the existing methods significantly in terms of precision. overall, convex achieved a sensitivity of more than 92% and a precision of more than 50%.
