BACKGROUND
cyclophilin a  represents a potential target for antiretroviral therapy since inhibition of cypa suppresses human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  replication, although the mechanism through which cypa modulates hiv- <dig> infectivity still remains unclear. the interaction of hiv- <dig> viral protein r  with the human peptidyl prolyl isomerase cypa is known to occur in vitro and in vivo. however, the nature of the interaction of cypa with pro- <dig> of n-terminal vpr has remained undefined.


RESULTS
characterization of the interactions of human cypa with n-terminal peptides of hiv- <dig> vpr has been achieved using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonace  exchange spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy . nmr data at atomic resolution indicate prolyl cis/trans isomerisation of the highly conserved proline residues pro- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> of vpr are catalyzed by human cypa and require only very low concentrations of the isomerase relative to that of the peptide substrates. of the n-terminal peptides of vpr only those containing pro- <dig> bind to cypa in a biosensor assay. spr studies of specific n-terminal peptides with decreasing numbers of residues revealed that a seven-residue motif centred at pro- <dig> consisting of rhfpriw, which under membrane-like solution conditions comprises the loop region connecting helix  <dig> and  <dig> of vpr and the two terminal residues of helix  <dig>  is sufficient to maintain strong specific binding.


CONCLUSIONS
only n-terminal peptides of vpr containing pro- <dig>  which appears to be vital for manifold functions of vpr, bind to cypa in a biosensor assay. this indicates that pro- <dig> is essential for a specific cypa-vpr binding interaction, in contrast to the general prolyl cis/trans isomerisation observed for all proline residues of vpr, which only involve transient enzyme-substrate interactions. previously suggested models depicting cypa as a chaperone that plays a role in hiv- <dig> virulence are now supported by our data. in detail the spr data of this interaction were compatible with a two-state binding interaction model that involves a conformational change during binding. this is in accord with the structural changes observed by nmr suggesting cypa catalyzes the prolyl cis/trans interconversion during binding to the rhfp35riw motif of n-terminal vpr.
