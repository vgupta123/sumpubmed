BACKGROUND
meloxicam  is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug used in the relief of postoperative pain for human and veterinary medicine. this study was designed to investigate the effect of surgery on the plasma disposition of mlx in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy following a single intravenous injection at a dose of  <dig>  mg/kg bodyweight. eight crossbred bitches were used in the study. a two-phase experimental design with a 10-day washout period was used. pre-operative mlx was administered intravenously to  <dig> bitches about 10 days before surgery  at a dose of  <dig>  mg/kg bodyweight and peri-operative mlx was administered intravenously after anaesthesia and 15 min before the start of surgery . blood samples were collected from all animals at various times between  <dig> and 96 h after the drug administrations in both phases. the drug concentrations were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography.


RESULTS
the volume of plasma mlx distribution at steady-state  of the control group  was significantly greater  compared to that of the surgery group . the auc values were higher  and the cl values were lower  in the surgery group compared to the control group, respectively, but differences were not significant.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study indicated that surgery could alter the plasma disposition of mlx and thus the drug efficacy and side effects such as gastrointestinal ulceration, unusual bleeding and loss of kidney function/failure when repeated doses are used.
