BACKGROUND
as a rule, about 1% of genes in a given genome encode glycoside hydrolases and their homologues. on the basis of sequence similarity they have been grouped into more than ninety gh families during the last  <dig> years. the gh <dig> family has been established very recently and initially included only  <dig> bacterial proteins. however, the evolutionary relationship of the genes encoding proteins of this family remains unclear, as well as their distribution among main groups of the living organisms.


RESULTS
the extensive search of the current databases allowed us to double the number of gh <dig> family proteins. five subfamilies were distinguished on the basis of pairwise sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis. iterative sequence analysis revealed the relationship of the gh <dig> family with the gh <dig>  gh <dig>  and gh <dig> families of glycosidases, which belong to the Î±-galactosidase superfamily, as well as a more distant relationship with some other glycosidase families .


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study show an unexpected sequence similarity of gh <dig> family proteins with glycoside hydrolases from several other families, that have 8-barrel fold of the catalytic domain and a retaining mechanism of the glycoside bond hydrolysis. these data suggest a common evolutionary origin of glycosidases representing different families and clans.
