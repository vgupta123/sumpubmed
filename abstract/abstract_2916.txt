BACKGROUND
germline genetic variation is associated with the differential expression of many human genes. the phenotypic effects of this type of variation may be important when considering susceptibility to common genetic diseases. three regions at 8q <dig> have recently been identified to independently confer risk of prostate cancer. variation at 8q <dig> has also recently been associated with risk of breast and colorectal cancer. however, none of the risk variants map at or relatively close to known genes, with c-myc mapping a few hundred kilobases distally.


RESULTS
this study identifies cis-regulators of germline c-myc expression in immortalized lymphocytes of hapmap individuals. quantitative analysis of c-myc expression in normal prostate tissues suggests an association between overexpression and variants in region  <dig> of prostate cancer risk. somatic c-myc overexpression correlates with prostate cancer progression and more aggressive tumor forms, which was also a pathological variable associated with region  <dig>  expression profiling analysis and modeling of transcriptional regulatory networks predicts a functional association between myc and the prostate tumor suppressor klf <dig>  analysis of myc/myc-driven cell transformation and tumorigenesis substantiates a model in which myc overexpression promotes transformation by down-regulating klf <dig>  in this model, a feedback loop through e-cadherin down-regulation causes further transactivation of c-myc.


CONCLUSIONS
this study proposes that variation at putative 8q <dig> cis-regulator of transcription can significantly alter germline c-myc expression levels and, thus, contribute to prostate cancer susceptibility by down-regulating the prostate tumor suppressor klf <dig> gene.
