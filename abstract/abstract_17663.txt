BACKGROUND
the increasing emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis presents a threat to the effective control of tuberculosis . rapid detection of drug-resistance is more important than ever to address this scourge. the purpose of this study was to genotypically characterize the first-line antitubercular drug-resistant isolates collected over 11 years in quebec.


RESULTS
the main mutations found in our resistant strains collection  include: the s315t substitution in katg , the - <dig> c/t mutation in the inha promoter ; the s531l substitution in rpob ; the deletion 8 bp  <dig> / + r140s in pnca ; the m306i  and m306v  substitutions in embb. ten of the mutations in katg and  <dig> mutations identified in pnca were previously undescribed.


CONCLUSIONS
screening of mutations conferring resistance to first-line antituberculous drugs using dna-sequencing approach seems to be feasible and would drastically shorten the time to determine the resistance profile compared to the proportion method.
