BACKGROUND
the major toxic effects of  <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin  appear to result from dysregulation of mrna levels mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor . dioxin-like chemicals alter expression of numerous genes in liver, but it remains unknown which lie in pathways leading to major toxicities such as hepatotoxicity, wasting and lethality. to identify genes involved in these responses we exploited a rat genetic model. rats expressing an ahr splice-variant lacking a portion of the transactivation domain are highly resistant to dioxin-induced toxicities. we examined changes in hepatic mrna abundances  <dig> hours after tcdd treatment in two dioxin-resistant rat strains/lines and two dioxin-sensitive rat strains/lines.


RESULTS
resistant rat strains/lines exhibited fewer transcriptional changes in response to tcdd than did rats with wildtype ahr. however, well-known ahr-regulated and dioxin-inducible genes such as cyp1a <dig>  cyp1a <dig>  and cyp1b <dig> remained fully responsive to tcdd in all strains/lines. pathway analysis indicated that the genes which respond differently to tcdd between sensitive and resistant rats are mainly involved in lipid metabolism, cellular membrane function and energy metabolism. these pathways previously have been shown to respond differently to dioxin treatment in dioxin-sensitive versus dioxin-resistant rats at a biochemical level and in the differential phenotype of toxicologic responses.


CONCLUSIONS
the transactivation-domain deletion in dioxin-resistant rats does not abolish global ahr transactivational activity but selectively interferes with expression of subsets of genes that are candidates to mediate or protect from major dioxin toxicities such as hepatotoxicity, wasting and death.
