BACKGROUND
the yersinia enterocolitica flagellar master regulator flhd/flhc affects the expression levels of non-flagellar genes, including  <dig> genes that are involved in central metabolism. the sigma factor of the flagellar system, flia, has a negative effect on the expression levels of seven plasmid-encoded virulence genes in addition to its positive effect on the expression levels of eight of the flagellar operons. this study investigates the phenotypes of flhd and flia mutants that result from the complex gene regulation.


RESULTS
phenotypes relating to central metabolism were investigated with phenotype microarrays. compared to the wild-type strain, isogenic flhd and flia mutants exhibited increased growth on purines and reduced growth on n-acetyl-d-glucosamine and d-mannose, when used as a sole carbon source. both mutants grew more poorly on pyrimidines and l-histidine as sole nitrogen source. several intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid and the urea cycle, as well as several dipeptides, provided differential growth conditions for the two mutants. gene expression was determined for selected genes and correlated with the observed phenotypes. phenotypes relating to virulence were determined with the chicken embryo lethality assay. the assay that was previously established for escherichia coli strains was modified for y. enterocolitica. the flhd mutant caused reduced chicken embryo lethality when compared to wild-type bacteria. in contrast, the flia mutant caused wild-type lethality. this indicates that the virulence phenotype of the flhd mutant might be due to genes that are regulated by flhd/flhc but not flia, such as those that encode the flagellar type iii secretion system.


CONCLUSIONS
phenotypes of flhd and flia mutants are related to central metabolism and virulence and correlate with gene regulation.
