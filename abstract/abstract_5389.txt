BACKGROUND
handling of common marmoset  usually requires chemical restraint. ketamine has been associated with muscle damage in primates, while common marmosets, compared to other primates, additionally display an exceptional high sensitivity to ketamine-associated side-effects. notably, muscle twitching movements of limbs and hands, and a marked increase in salivation are observed. we investigated two alternative intramuscular  immobilisation protocols against ketamine  in a double-blind randomised crossover study in ten healthy adult common marmosets for use as a safe reliable, short-term immobilisation and sedation. these protocols comprised: alphaxalone  and 25 mg/kg ketamine combined with  <dig>  mg/kg medetomidine . following completion and unblinding, the project was extended with an additional protocol , comprising 25 mg/kg ketamine combined with  <dig>  mg/kg medetomidine .


RESULTS
all protocols in this study provided rapid onset  of immobilisation and sedation. duration of immobilisation was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min for protocol  <dig>   <dig>  3a, and 3b, respectively. recovery times were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min, respectively. regarding the quality, and reliability  of all protocols, protocol  <dig> was the most optimal. monitored vital parameters were within clinically acceptable limits during all protocols and there were no fatalities. indication of muscle damage as assessed by ast, ldh and ck values was most prominent elevated in protocol  <dig>  3a, and 3b.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that intramuscular administration of 12 mg/kg alphaxalone to common marmosets is preferred over other protocols studied. protocol  <dig> resulted in at least comparable immobilisation quality with acceptable and less frequent side effects and superior recovery quality. in all protocols, supportive therapy, such as external heat support, remains mandatory. notably, an unacceptable long recovery period in both ketamine/medetomidine protocols  was observed, showing that α- <dig> adrenoreceptor agonists in the used dose and dosing regime is not the first choice for sedation in common marmosets in a standard research setting.
