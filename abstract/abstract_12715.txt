BACKGROUND
copy number variants  have been shown to play an important role in genetic diversity of mammals and in the development of many complex phenotypic traits. the aim of this study was to perform a standard comparative evaluation of cnvs in horses using three different cnv detection programs and to identify genomic regions associated with body size in horses.


RESULTS
analysis was performed using the illumina equine snp <dig> genotyping beadchip for  <dig> horses. cnvs were detected by three different algorithms, cnvpartition, penncnv and quantisnp. comparative analysis revealed  <dig> cnvs that affected  <dig> different genes mainly involved in sensory perception, signal transduction and cellular components. genome-wide association analysis for body size showed highly significant deleted regions on eca <dig>  eca <dig> and eca <dig>  homologous regions to the detected cnvs on eca <dig> and eca <dig> have also been shown to be correlated with human height.


CONCLUSIONS
comparative analysis of cnv detection algorithms was useful to increase the specificity of cnv detection but had certain limitations dependent on the detection tool. gwas revealed genome-wide associated cnvs for body size in horses.
