BACKGROUND
short-term experiments have indicated that warmer temperatures can alter fungal biomass production and co <dig> respiration, with potential consequences for soil c storage. however, we know little about the capacity of fungi to adapt to warming in ways that may alter c dynamics. thus, we exposed neurospora discreta to moderately warm  and warm  selective temperatures for  <dig> mitotic generations, and then examined changes in mycelial growth rate, biomass, spore production, and co <dig> respiration. we tested the hypothesis that strains will adapt to its selective temperature. specifically, we expected that adapted strains would grow faster, and produce more spores per unit biomass . in contrast, they should generate less co <dig> per unit biomass due to higher efficiency in carbon use metabolism .


RESULTS
indeed, n. discreta adapted to warm temperatures, based on patterns of relative spore production. adapted strains produced more spores per unit biomass than parental strains in the selective temperature. contrary to our expectations, this increase in relative spore production was accompanied by an increase in msr and a reduction in mycelial growth rate and biomass, compared to parental strains.


CONCLUSIONS
adaptation of n. discreta to warm temperatures may have elicited a tradeoff between biomass production and relative spore production, possibly because relative spore production required higher msr rates. therefore, our results do not support the idea that adaptation to warm temperatures will lead to a more efficient carbon use metabolism. our data might help improve climate change model simulations and provide more concise predictions of decomposition processes and carbon feedbacks to the atmosphere.
