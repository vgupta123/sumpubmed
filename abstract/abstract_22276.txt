BACKGROUND
because common complex diseases are affected by multiple genes and environmental factors, it is essential to investigate gene-gene and/or gene-environment interactions to understand genetic architecture of complex diseases. after the great success of large scale genome-wide association  studies using the high density single nucleotide polymorphism  chips, the study of gene-gene interaction becomes a next challenge. multifactor dimensionality reduction  analysis has been widely used for the gene-gene interaction analysis. in practice, however, it is not easy to perform high order gene-gene interaction analyses via mdr in genome-wide level because it requires exploring a huge search space and suffers from a computational burden due to high dimensionality.


RESULTS
we propose dimensional reduction analysis, gene-mdr analysis for the fast and efficient high order gene-gene interaction analysis. the proposed gene-mdr method is composed of two-step applications of mdr: within- and between-gene mdr analyses. first, within-gene mdr analysis summarizes each gene effect via mdr analysis by combining multiple snps from the same gene. second, between-gene mdr analysis then performs interaction analysis using the summarized gene effects from within-gene mdr analysis. we apply the gene-mdr method to bipolar disorder  gwa data from wellcome trust case control consortium . the results demonstrate that gene-mdr is capable of detecting high order gene-gene interactions associated with bd.


CONCLUSIONS
by reducing the dimension of genome-wide data from snp level to gene level, gene-mdr efficiently identifies high order gene-gene interactions. therefore, gene-mdr can provide the key to understand complex disease etiology.
