BACKGROUND
burkholderia cenocepacia is a threatening nosocomial epidemic pathogen in patients with cystic fibrosis  or a compromised immune system. its high level of antibiotic resistance is an increasing concern in treatments against its infection. strain b. cenocepacia j <dig> is the most infectious isolate from cf patients. there is a strong demand to reconstruct a genome-scale metabolic network of b. cenocepacia j <dig> to systematically analyze its metabolic capabilities and its virulence traits, and to search for potential clinical therapy targets.


RESULTS
we reconstructed the genome-scale metabolic network of b. cenocepacia j <dig>  an iterative reconstruction process led to the establishment of a robust model, ikf <dig>  which accounts for  <dig>  genes,  <dig> internal reactions, and  <dig> metabolites. the model ikf <dig> captures important metabolic capabilities of b. cenocepacia j <dig> with a particular focus on the biosyntheses of key metabolic virulence factors to assist in understanding the mechanism of disease infection and identifying potential drug targets. the model was tested through biolog assays. based on the model, the genome annotation of b. cenocepacia j <dig> was refined and  <dig> genes were properly re-annotated. gene and enzyme essentiality were analyzed to provide further insights into the genome function and architecture. a total of  <dig> essential enzymes were identified as potential therapeutic targets.


CONCLUSIONS
as the first genome-scale metabolic network of b. cenocepacia j <dig>  ikf <dig> allows a systematic study of the metabolic properties of b. cenocepacia and its key metabolic virulence factors affecting the cf community. the model can be used as a discovery tool to design novel drugs against diseases caused by this notorious pathogen.
