BACKGROUND
genome sequencing projects generate massive amounts of sequence data but there are still many proteins whose functions remain unknown. the availability of large scale protein-protein interaction data sets makes it possible to develop new function prediction methods based on protein-protein interaction  networks. although several existing methods combine multiple information resources, there is no study that integrates protein domain information and ppi networks to predict protein functions.


RESULTS
the domain context similarity can be a useful index to predict protein function similarity. the prediction accuracy of our method in yeast is between 63%-67%, which outperforms the other methods in terms of roc curves.


CONCLUSIONS
this paper presents a novel protein function prediction method that combines protein domain composition information and ppi networks. performance evaluations show that this method outperforms existing methods.
