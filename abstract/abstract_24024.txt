BACKGROUND
although cerebral palsy  is usually defined as a group of permanent motor disorders due to non-progressive disturbances in the developing fetal or infant brain, recent research has shown that cp individuals are also characterized by altered somatosensory perception, increased pain and abnormal activation of cortical somatosensory areas. the present study was aimed to examine hemispheric differences on somatosensory brain processing in individuals with bilateral cp and lateralized motor impairments compared with healthy controls. nine cp individuals with left-dominant motor impairments  , nine cp individuals with right-dominant motor impairments  , and  <dig> healthy controls  participated in the study. proprioception, touch and pain thresholds, as well as somatosensory evoked potentials  elicited by tactile stimulation of right and left lips and thumbs were compared.


RESULTS
pain sensitivity was higher, and lip stimulation elicited greater beta power and more symmetrical sep amplitudes in individuals with cp than in healthy controls. in addition, although there was no significant differences between individuals with rmi and lmi on pain or touch sensitivity, lip and thumb stimulation elicited smaller beta power and more symmetrical sep amplitudes in individuals with lmi than with rmi.


CONCLUSIONS
our data revealed that brain processing of somatosensory stimulation was abnormal in cp individuals. moreover, this processing was different depending if they presented right- or left-dominant motor impairments, suggesting that different mechanisms of sensorimotor reorganization should be involved in cp depending on dominant side of motor impairment.
