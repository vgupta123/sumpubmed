BACKGROUND
smad <dig> mutant embryos arrest shortly after implantation and display a characteristic shortened proximodistal axis, a significantly reduced epiblast, as well as a thickened visceral endoderm layer. conditional rescue experiments demonstrate that bypassing the primary requirement for smad <dig> in the extra-embryonic endoderm allows the epiblast to gastrulate. smad4-independent tgf-β signals are thus sufficient to promote mesoderm formation and patterning. to further analyse essential smad <dig> activities contributed by the extra-embryonic tissues, and characterise smad <dig> dependent pathways in the early embryo, here we performed transcriptional profiling of smad <dig> null embryonic stem  cells and day  <dig> embryoid bodies .


RESULTS
transcripts from wild-type versus smad <dig> null es cells and day  <dig> ebs were analysed using illumina arrays. in addition to several known tgf-β/bmp target genes, we identified numerous smad4-dependent transcripts that are mis-expressed in the mutants. as expected, mesodermal cell markers were dramatically down-regulated. we also observed an increase in non-canonical potency markers , germ cell markers  as well as early endoderm markers . additionally, expression of the extracellular matrix  remodelling enzymes mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> was decreased in smad <dig> mutant es and eb populations. these changes, in combination with increased levels of laminin alpha <dig>  cause excessive basement membrane deposition. similarly, in the context of the smad <dig> null e <dig>  embryos we observed an expanded basement membrane  associated with the thickened endoderm layer.


CONCLUSIONS
smad <dig> functional loss results in a dramatic shift in gene expression patterns and in the endodermal cell lineage causes an excess deposition of, or an inability to breakdown and remodel, the underlying bm layer. these structural abnormalities probably disrupt reciprocal signalling between the epiblast and overlying visceral endoderm required for gastrulation.
