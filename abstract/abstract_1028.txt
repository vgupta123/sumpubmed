BACKGROUND
the statistical modeling of biomedical corpora could yield integrated,
coarse-to-fine views of biological phenomena that complement discoveries
made from analysis of molecular sequence and profiling data. here, the
potential of such modeling is demonstrated by examining the  <dig>  free-text
items in the caenorhabditis genetic center  bibliography using
techniques from statistical information retrieval. items in the cgc
biomedical text corpus were modeled using the latent dirichlet allocation
 model. lda is a hierarchical bayesian model which represents a
document as a random mixture over latent topics; each topic is characterized
by a distribution over words.


RESULTS
an lda model estimated from cgc items had better predictive performance than
two standard models  trained using the same
data. to illustrate the practical utility of lda models of biomedical
corpora, a trained cgc lda model was used for a retrospective study of
nematode genes known to be associated with life span modification. corpus-,
document-, and word-level lda parameters were combined with terms from the
gene ontology to enhance the explanatory value of the cgc lda model, and to
suggest additional candidates for age-related genes. a novel, pairwise
document similarity measure based on the posterior distribution on the topic
simplex was formulated and used to search the cgc database for "homologs" of
a "query" document discussing the life span-modifying clk- <dig> gene.
inspection of these document homologs enabled and facilitated the production
of hypotheses about the function and role of clk- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
like other graphical models for genetic, genomic and other types of
biological data, lda provides a method for extracting unanticipated insights
and generating predictions amenable to subsequent experimental
validation.
