BACKGROUND
digital dermatitis  is a common disease of dairy cows, the pathogenesis of which is still not clear. this study examined some host responses associated with the typical lesions, in an attempt to further elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease. twenty four samples representing the  <dig> different clinical stages of dd  were collected from slaughtered cattle for histopathological and immunological analyses.


RESULTS
significant increases in total epidermal thickness were found in m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> when compared with m <dig> and m <dig>  m <dig> samples, when compared with m <dig> and m <dig>  were characterized by a significant increase in the thickness of the keratin layer. counts of both eosinophils and neutrophils were at a maximum in the m <dig> stage and decreased in the m <dig> and m <dig> stage. a significant increase in il <dig> expression was observed in the m2-m <dig> stages of the disease and immunohistochemical staining showed the source as keratinocytes, suggesting an important role for keratinocyte-derived il <dig> in the pathogenesis of dd.


CONCLUSIONS
results of the present study point to a strong stimulation of the innate immune response at the level of the keratinocytes throughout most of the clinical stages, and a delayed response of the adaptive immune reaction.
