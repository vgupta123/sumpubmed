BACKGROUND
the fruit fly bactrocera oleae is the primary biotic stressor of cultivated olives, causing direct and indirect damages that significantly reduce both the yield and the quality of olive oil. to study the olive-b. oleae interaction, we conducted transcriptomic and proteomic investigations of the molecular response of the drupe. the identifications of genes and proteins involved in the fruit response were performed using a suppression subtractive hybridisation technique and a combined bi-dimensional electrophoresis/nanolc-esi-lit-ms/ms approach, respectively.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> ests and  <dig> protein spots as differentially expressed in olives with larval feeding tunnels. a bioinformatic analysis of the identified non-redundant est and protein collection indicated that different molecular processes were affected, such as stress response, phytohormone signalling, transcriptional control and primary metabolism, and that a considerable proportion of the ests could not be classified. the altered expression of  <dig> transcripts was also analysed by real-time pcr, and the most striking differences were further confirmed in the fruit of a different olive variety. we also cloned the full-length coding sequences of two genes, oe-chitinase i and oe-pr <dig>  and showed that these are wound-inducible genes and activated by b. oleae punctures.


CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the first report that reveals the molecular players and signalling pathways involved in the interaction between the olive fruit and its most damaging biotic stressor. drupe response is complex, involving genes and proteins involved in photosynthesis as well as in the production of ros, the activation of different stress response pathways and the production of compounds involved in direct defence against phytophagous larvae. among the latter, trypsin inhibitors should play a major role in drupe resistance reaction.
