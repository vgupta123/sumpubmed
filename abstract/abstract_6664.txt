BACKGROUND
daphniids, commonly known as waterfleas, serve as important model systems for ecology, evolution and the environmental sciences. the sequencing and annotation of the daphnia pulex genome both open future avenues of research on this model organism. as proteomics is not only essential to our understanding of cell function, and is also a powerful validation tool for predicted genes in genome annotation projects, a first proteomic dataset is presented in this article.


RESULTS
a comprehensive set of  <dig>  peptide tandem-mass-spectra, derived from daphnia pulex, was generated, which lead to the identification of  <dig> proteins. to measure the impact of the daphnia pulex filtered models database for mass spectrometry based daphnia protein identification, this result was compared with results obtained with the swiss-prot and the drosophila melanogaster database. to further validate the utility of the daphnia pulex database for research on other daphnia species, additional  <dig>  peptide tandem-mass-spectra, obtained from daphnia longicephala, were generated and evaluated, leading to the identification of  <dig> proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
peptides identified in our approach provide the first experimental evidence for the translation of a broad variety of predicted coding regions within the daphnia genome. furthermore it could be demonstrated that identification of daphnia longicephala proteins using the daphnia pulex protein database is feasible but shows a slightly reduced identification rate. data provided in this article clearly demonstrates that the daphnia genome database is the key for mass spectrometry based high throughput proteomics in daphnia.
