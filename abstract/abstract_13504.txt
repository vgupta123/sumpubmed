BACKGROUND
protein kinase ck <dig> is a pleiotropic serine/threonine protein kinase with hundreds of reported substrates, and plays an important role in a number of cellular processes. the cellular functions of plasmodium falciparum ck <dig>  are unknown. the parasite's genome encodes one catalytic subunit, pfck2α, which we have previously shown to be essential for completion of the asexual erythrocytic cycle, and two putative regulatory subunits, pfck2β <dig> and pfck2β <dig> 


RESULTS
we now show that the genes encoding both regulatory pfck <dig> subunits  cannot be disrupted. using immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, we examined the intra-erythrocytic stages of transgenic parasite lines expressing hemagglutinin -tagged catalytic and regulatory subunits , and localized all three subunits to both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of the parasite. the same transgenic parasite lines were used to purify pfck2β1- and pfck2β2-containing complexes, which were analyzed by mass spectrometry. the recovered proteins were unevenly distributed between various pathways, with a large proportion of components of the chromatin assembly pathway being present in both pfck2β <dig> and pfck2β <dig> precipitates, implicating pfck <dig> in chromatin dynamics. we also found that chromatin-related substrates such as nucleosome assembly proteins , histones, and two members of the alba family are phosphorylated by pfck2α in vitro.


CONCLUSIONS
our reverse-genetics data show that each of the two regulatory pfck <dig> subunits is required for completion of the asexual erythrocytic cycle. our interactome study points to an implication of pfck <dig> in many cellular pathways, with chromatin dynamics being identified as a major process regulated by pfck <dig>  this study paves the way for a kinome-wide interactomics-based approach to elucidate protein kinase function in malaria parasites.
