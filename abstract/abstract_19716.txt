BACKGROUND
pyocyanin , an extracellular product of pseudomonas aeruginosa and a blue redox active secondary metabolite, plays an important role in invasive pulmonary infection. however, the detailed inflammatory response triggered by pcn infection in inflammatory cells , if present, remains to be clarified. to investigate the effects of pcn on macrophages, the ability of pcn to induce inflammation reaction and the signaling pathway for il- <dig> release in pcn-induced differentiated u <dig> cells were examined.


RESULTS
it was found that pcn increased il- <dig> release and mrna expression in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate  differentiated u <dig> cells in both a concentration- and time-dependent manner by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . p <dig> and erk mapks were activated after 10 min of induction with pcn and their levels returned to baselines after 30 min by western blotting. it was also found that within 10 min of pcn incubation, the level of p-i-κbα in the cytosol was increased, which returned to baseline level after 60 min. meanwhile, the level of p-p <dig> was increased in the nuclear extract and cytosol, and maintained high in total cell lysates. the results were further confirmed by the observation that p <dig>  erk1/ <dig> and nf-κb inhibitors inhibited pcn-induced nf-κb activation and attenuated pcn-induced il- <dig> expression in u <dig> cells as a function of their concentrations. moreover, it was shown that pcn induced oxidative stress in u <dig> cells and n-acetyl cysteine, an antioxidant, was able to inhibit pcn-induced il- <dig> protein expression.


CONCLUSIONS
it is concluded that pcn induces il- <dig> secretion and mrna expression in pma-differentiated u <dig> cells in a concentration- and time- dependent manner. furthermore, p <dig> and erk mapks and nf-κΒ signaling pathways may be involved in the expression of il- <dig> in pcn-incubated pma-differentiated u <dig> cells.
