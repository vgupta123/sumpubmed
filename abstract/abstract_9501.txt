BACKGROUND
exopolyphosphatases and pyrophosphatases play important but still incompletely understood roles in energy metabolism, and also in other aspects of cell biology such as osmoregulation or signal transduction. earlier work has suggested that a human exopolyphosphatase, prune, might exhibit cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity.


RESULTS
the kinetoplastida, a large order of unicellular eukaryotes that contains many important pathogens such as trypanosoma brucei , trypanosoma cruzi  or leishmania ssp  all contain several exo- and pyrophosphatases. the current study provides a systematic classification of these enzymes, which now allows to situate the information that is already available on some of these enzymes. it then analyses the exopolyphosphatase tbrppx <dig> of t. brucei in detail, using rna interference and genetic knockouts in an attempt to define its function, and immunofluorescence microscopy to study its subcellular localization.

tbrppx <dig> is an exopolyphosphatase that does hydrolyze pentasodium triphosphate, but not organic triphosphates such as atp, pyrophosphate or long-chain polyphosphates. finally, the study investigates the potential cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity of tbrppx <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
all kinetoplastid genomes that are currently available contain genes for an exopolyphosphatase and two classes of pyrophosphatases, one associated with the acidocalcisomes and one cytoplasmic. tbrppx <dig> represents the t. brucei exopolyphosphatase. it is located throughout the cytoplasm, and its genetic ablation does not produce a dramatic phenotype. importantly, tbrppx <dig> does not exhibit any cyclic nucleotide specific phosphodiesterase activity, which definitively eliminates it as an additional player in camp signalling of the kinetoplastida.
