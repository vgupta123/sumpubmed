BACKGROUND
cadmium, a heavy metal, which has a potent harmful effects, is a highly stress-inducible material that is robustly expressed following disruption of homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum  . the mechanism cd induced cell death of neuroblastoma cells complex, involving cellular signaling pathways as yet incompletely defined but, in part, involving the generation of reactive oxygen species . several studies have correlated gadd <dig> expression with cell death, but a mechanistic link between gadd <dig> and apoptosis has never been demonstrated.


RESULTS
sh-sy5y cells were treated cd led to increase in intracellular ros levels. ros generation is not consistent with intracellular . the exposure of neuroblastoma cells to cd led to increase in intracellular gadd <dig> and bak levels in a doses and time dependent manner. the induction of these genes by cd was attenuated by nac. cd-induced apoptosis is decreased in gadd <dig> knockdown cells compared with normal cells. the effect of gadd <dig> on the binding of c/ebp to the bak promoters were analyzed chip assay. basal constitutive gadd <dig> recruitment to the – <dig> /– <dig>  region of the bak promoter is observed in sh-sy5y cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the exposure of sh-sy5y cells to cd led to increase in intracellular ros levels in a doses and time dependent manner. the generation of ros result in the induction of gadd <dig> is causative of cadmium-induced apoptosis. gadd <dig> regulates bak expression by its binding to promoter region . therefore, we conclude that gadd <dig> sensitizes cells to ros through mechanisms that involve up-regulation of bak and enhanced oxidant injury.
