BACKGROUND
new world monkeys  are unique in that they exhibit remarkable interspecific variation in color vision and feeding behavior, making them an excellent model for studying sensory ecology. however, it is largely unknown whether non-visual senses co-vary with feeding ecology, especially gustation, which is expected to be indispensable in food selection. bitter taste, which is mediated by bitter taste receptors  in the tongue, helps organisms avoid ingesting potentially toxic substances in food. in this study, we compared the ligand sensitivities of the tas2rs of five species of nwms by heterologous expression in hek293t cells and calcium imaging.


RESULTS
we found that tas2r <dig> and tas2r <dig> orthologs differ in sensitivity among the nwm species for colchicine and camphor, respectively. we then reconstructed the ancestral receptors of nwm tas2r <dig> and tas2r <dig>  measured the evolutionary shift in ligand sensitivity, and identified the amino acid replacement at residue  <dig> as responsible for the high sensitivity of marmoset tas2r <dig> to colchicine.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide a basis for understanding the differences in feeding ecology among nwms with respect to bitter taste.
