BACKGROUND
soybeans play a prominent role in allergologic research due to the high incidence of allergic reactions. for detailed studies on specific proteins it is necessary to have access to a large amount of pure substance.


RESULTS
in this contribution, a method for purifying soybean  protein p <dig>  using hydrophobic interaction chromatography is presented. after screening experiments using  <dig> ml hitrap columns, butyl sepharose  <dig> ff was selected for further systematic investigations. with this stationary phase, suitable operation conditions for two-step gradient elution using ammonium sulphate were determined experimentally. the separation conditions obtained in a small column could be scaled up successfully to column volumes of  <dig>  and  <dig> ml, allowing for high product purities of almost 100% with a yield of 27% for the chromatographic separation step. conditions could be simplified further using a onestep gradient, which gave comparable purification in a shorter process time. the identity of the purified protein was verified using in-gel digestion and mass spectrometry as well as immunological techniques.


CONCLUSIONS
with the technique presented it is possible to produce, within a short timeframe, pure p <dig>  suitable for further studies where an example antigen is needed.
