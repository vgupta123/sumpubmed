BACKGROUND
the accuracy of protein secondary structure prediction has steadily improved over the past  <dig> years. now many secondary structure prediction methods routinely achieve an accuracy  of about 75%. we believe this accuracy could be further improved by including structure  database comparisons as part of the prediction process. indeed, given the large size of the protein data bank , the probability of a newly identified sequence having a structural homologue is actually quite high.


RESULTS
we have developed a method that performs structure-based sequence alignments as part of the secondary structure prediction process. by mapping the structure of a known homologue  onto the query protein's sequence, it is possible to predict at least a portion of that query protein's secondary structure. by integrating this structural alignment approach with conventional  secondary structure methods and then combining it with a "jury-of-experts" system to generate a consensus result, it is possible to attain very high prediction accuracy. using a sequence-unique test set of  <dig> proteins from eva, this new method achieves an average q <dig> score of  <dig> %. extensive testing indicates this is approximately 4â€“5% better than any other method currently available. assessments using non sequence-unique test sets  indicate that this new method can achieve a q <dig> score approaching 88%.


CONCLUSIONS
by using both sequence and structure databases and by exploiting the latest techniques in machine learning it is possible to routinely predict protein secondary structure with an accuracy well above 80%. a program and web server, called proteus, that performs these secondary structure predictions is accessible at . for high throughput or batch sequence analyses, the proteus programs, databases  can be downloaded and run locally.
