BACKGROUND
identifying essential genes in bacteria supports to identify potential drug targets and an understanding of minimal requirements for a synthetic cell. however, experimentally assaying the essentiality of their coding genes is resource intensive and not feasible for all bacterial organisms, in particular if they are infective.


RESULTS
we developed a machine learning technique to identify essential genes using the experimental data of genome-wide knock-out screens from one bacterial organism to infer essential genes of another related bacterial organism. we used a broad variety of topological features, sequence characteristics and co-expression properties potentially associated with essentiality, such as flux deviations, centrality, codon frequencies of the sequences, co-regulation and phyletic retention. an organism-wise cross-validation on bacterial species yielded reliable results with good accuracies . finally, it was applied to drug target predictions for salmonella typhimurium. we compared our predictions to the viability of experimental knock-outs of s. typhimurium and identified  <dig> enzymes, which are highly relevant to be considered as potential drug targets. specifically, we detected promising drug targets in the non-mevalonate pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
using elaborated features characterizing network topology, sequence information and microarray data enables to predict essential genes from a bacterial reference organism to a related query organism without any knowledge about the essentiality of genes of the query organism. in general, such a method is beneficial for inferring drug targets when experimental data about genome-wide knockout screens is not available for the investigated organism.
