BACKGROUND
xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous is a basidiomycetous yeast that is relevant to biotechnology, as it can synthesize the carotenoid astaxanthin. however, the astaxanthin levels produced by wild-type strains are low. although different approaches for promoting increased astaxanthin production have been attempted, no commercially competitive results have been obtained thus far. a promising alternative to facilitate the production of carotenoids in this yeast involves the use of genetic modification. however, a major limitation is the few available molecular tools to manipulate x. dendrorhous.


RESULTS
in this work, the dna assembler methodology that was previously described in saccharomyces cerevisiae was successfully applied to assemble dna fragments in vivo and integrate these fragments into the genome of x. dendrorhous by homologous recombination in only one transformation event. using this method, the gene encoding astaxanthin synthase  was overexpressed in x. dendrorhous and a higher level of astaxanthin was produced.


CONCLUSIONS
this methodology could be used to easily and rapidly overexpress individual genes or combinations of genes simultaneously in x. dendrorhous, eliminating numerous steps involved in conventional cloning methods.
