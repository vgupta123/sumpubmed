BACKGROUND
endogenous nitric oxide  and carbon monoxide  are generated by nitric oxide synthase and heme oxygenase, respectively. like no, co has been accepted as an important cellular signaling molecule in biological systems. an up-regulation in both gene and protein expression of heme oxygenase- <dig>  under oxidative/nitrosative stress has been well documented, and the protective role of ho- <dig> and ho- <dig> against oxidative damage is proposed. however, data on the direct effect of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species  on ho function is incomplete. using gas chromatography to quantify carbon monoxide  formation from heme oxidation, we investigated the effects of peroxynitrite  on the in vitro catalytic activity of rat spleen  and brain  microsomal heme oxygenases.


RESULTS
exposure to onoo- led to concentration-dependent but reversible decreases in the activity of microsomal rat spleen and brain ho activity. spleen ho activity was 100-fold more sensitive to onoo--dependent inactivation compared to that of the brain, with ic <dig> values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm respectively. inhibition of both rat spleen and brain microsomal ho activity was also observed with tetra-nitromethane, a tyrosine nitrating agent, as well as two no donors, s-nitrosoglutathione  and diethylamine nonoate . however, no additive effect was found following the application of no donors and onoo- together.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that onoo- may regulate ho- <dig> and ho- <dig> activities by mechanisms that involve different interactions with these proteins. it is suggested that while nitration of tyrosine residues and oxidation of sulfhydryl groups may be involved, consideration should be given to other facets of onoo- chemistry. this inhibition of ho activity offers a mechanism for cross talk between the nitric oxide synthase and ho systems.
