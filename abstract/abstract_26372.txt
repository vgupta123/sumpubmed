BACKGROUND
application of phenetic methods to gene expression analysis proved to be a successful approach. visualizing the results in a 3-dimentional space may further enhance these techniques.


RESULTS
we designed and built treebuilder3d, an interactive viewer for visualizing the hierarchical relationships between expression profiles such as sage libraries or microarrays. the program allows loading expression data as plain text files and visualizing the relative differences of the analyzed datasets in 3-dimensional space using various distance metrics.


CONCLUSIONS
treebuilder3d provides a simple interface and has a small size. written in java, treebuilder3d is a platform-independent, open source application, which may be useful in analysis of large-scale gene expression data.
