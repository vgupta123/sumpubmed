BACKGROUND
the down syndrome phenotype has been attributed to overexpression of chromosome  <dig>  genes. however, the expression profile of hsa <dig> genes in trisomic human subjects as well as their effects on genes located on different chromosomes are largely unknown. using oligonucleotide microarrays we compared the gene expression profiles of hearts of human fetuses with and without hsa <dig> trisomy.


RESULTS
approximately half of the  <dig>  genes examined  were expressed in the heart at 18â€“ <dig> weeks of gestation. hsa <dig> gene expression was globally upregulated  <dig>  fold in trisomic samples. however, not all genes were equally dysregulated and  <dig> genes were not upregulated at all. genes located on other chromosomes were also significantly dysregulated. functional class scoring and gene set enrichment analyses of  <dig> genes, differentially expressed between trisomic and non-trisomic hearts, revealed downregulation of genes encoding mitochondrial enzymes and upregulation of genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins. there were no significant differences between trisomic fetuses with and without heart defects.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that dosage-dependent upregulation of hsa <dig> genes causes dysregulation of the genes responsible for mitochondrial function and for the extracellular matrix organization in the fetal heart of trisomic subjects. these alterations might be harbingers of the heart defects associated with hsa <dig> trisomy, which could be based on elusive mechanisms involving genetic variability, environmental factors and/or stochastic events.
