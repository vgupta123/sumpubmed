BACKGROUND
the protein p49/strap  is a transcription cofactor of serum response factor  which regulates cytoskeletal and muscle-specific genes.


RESULTS
two conserved domains were found in the p49/strap protein. the srf-binding domain was at its n-terminus and was highly conserved among mammalian species, xenopus and zebrafish. a bud <dig> domain was found at its c-terminus in three sequence databases. the bud <dig> domain was conserved among mammalian p49/strap proteins, and yeast cellular morphogenesis proteins, which is involved in ribosome biogenesis that affects growth rate and cell size. the endogenous p49/srap protein was localized mainly in the nucleus but also widely distributed in the cytoplasm, and was in close proximity to the actin. transfected gfp-p49/strap protein co-localized with nucleolin within the nucleolus. overexpression of p49/strap reduced actin content in cultured cells and resulted in smaller cell size versus control cells. increased expression of p49/strap in transgenic mice resulted in newborns with malformations, which included asymmetric abdominal and thoracic cavities, and substantial changes in cardiac morphology. p49/strap altered the expression of certain muscle-specific genes, including that of the srf gene, which is a key regulator of cardiac genes at the developmental, structural and maintenance level and has two sre binding sites.


CONCLUSIONS
since p49/strap is a co-factor of srf, our data suggest that p49/strap likely regulates cell size and morphology through srf target genes. the function of its bud <dig> domain warrants further investigation. the observed increase in p49/strap expression during cellular aging may contribute to observed morphological changes in senescence.
