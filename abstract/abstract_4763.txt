BACKGROUND
multiple sclerosis  is an autoimmune disease in which dysregulated immune cells attack myelin in the central nervous system , leading to irreversible neuronal degeneration. our previous studies have demonstrated that epidermal fatty acid binding protein , widely expressed in immune cells, in particular in dendritic cells  and t lymphocytes, fuels the overactive immune responses in the mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis .

methods
in the present study, we conducted an intensive computational docking analysis to identify novel e-fabp inhibitors for regulation of immune cell functions and for treatment of eae.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that compound isoquinolin-4-one; designated as ei-03] bound to the lipid binding pocket of e-fabp and enhanced the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor  γ. further in vitro experiments showed that ei- <dig> regulated dc functions by inhibition of tnfα production while promoting il- <dig> secretion. moreover, ei- <dig> treatment counterregulated t cell balance by decreasing effector t cell differentiation  while increasing regulatory t cell development. most importantly, mice treated with this newly identified compound exhibited reduced clinical symptoms of eae in mouse models.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, we have identified a new compound which displays a potential therapeutic benefit for treatment of ms by targeting e-fabp.
