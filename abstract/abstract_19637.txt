BACKGROUND
the rett syndrome  brain displays regional histopathology and volumetric reduction, with frontal cortex showing such abnormalities, whereas the occipital cortex is relatively less affected.


RESULTS
using microarrays and quantitative pcr, the mrna expression profiles of these two neuroanatomical regions were compared in postmortem brain tissue from rtt patients and normal controls. a subset of genes was differentially expressed in the frontal cortex of rtt brains, some of which are known to be associated with neurological disorders  or are involved in synaptic vesicle cycling . rnai-mediated knockdown of mecp <dig> in vitro, followed by further expression analysis demonstrated that the same direction of abnormal expression was recapitulated with mecp <dig> knockdown, which for cytochrome c oxidase subunit  <dig> was associated with a functional respiratory chain defect. chromatin immunoprecipitation  analysis showed that mecp <dig> associated with the promoter regions of some of these genes suggesting that loss of mecp <dig> function may be responsible for their overexpression.


CONCLUSIONS
this study has shed more light on the subset of aberrantly expressed genes that result from mecp <dig> mutations. the mitochondrion has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of rtt, however it has not been at the forefront of rtt research interest since the discovery of mecp <dig> mutations. the functional consequence of the underexpression of cytochrome c oxidase subunit  <dig> indicates that this is an area that should be revisited.
