BACKGROUND
alzheimer's disease  is the most common of the conformational neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the conversion of a normal biological protein into a β-sheet-rich pathological isoform. in ad the normal soluble aβ  forms oligomers and fibrils which assemble into neuritic plaques. the most toxic form of aβ is thought to be oligomeric. a recent study reveals the cellular prion protein, prpc, to be a receptor for aβ oligomers. aβ oligomers suppress ltp signal in murine hippocampal slices but activity remains when pretreated with the prp monoclonal anti-prp antibody, 6d <dig>  we hypothesized that targeting of prpc to prevent aβ oligomer-related cognitive deficits is a potentially novel therapeutic approach. app/ps <dig> transgenic mice aged  <dig> months were intraperitoneally  injected with  <dig> mg 6d <dig> for  <dig> days/week for  <dig> weeks. two wild-type control groups were given either the same 6d <dig> injections or vehicle solution. additional groups of app/ps <dig> transgenic mice were given either i.p. injections of vehicle solution or the same dose of mouse igg over the same period. the mice were then subjected to cognitive behavioral testing using a radial arm maze, over a period of  <dig> days. at the conclusion of behavioral testing, animals were sacrificed and brain tissue was analyzed biochemically or immunohistochemically for the levels of amyloid plaques, prpc, synaptophysin, aβ40/ <dig> and aβ oligomers.


RESULTS
behavioral testing showed a marked decrease in errors in 6d <dig> treated app/ps <dig> tg mice compared with the non-6d <dig> treated tg groups . 6d <dig> treated app/ps <dig> tg mice behaved the same as wild-type controls indicating a recovery in cognitive learning, even after this short term 6d <dig> treatment. brain tissue analysis from both treated and vehicle treated app/ps <dig> groups indicate no significant differences in amyloid plaque burden, aβ40/ <dig>  prpc or aβ oligomer levels. 6d <dig> treated app/ps <dig> tg mice had significantly greater synaptophysin immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus molecular layer of the hippocampus compared to vehicle treated app/ps <dig> tg mice .


CONCLUSIONS
even short term treatment with monoclonal antibodies such as 6d <dig> or other compounds which block the binding of aβ oligomers to prpc can be used to treat cognitive deficits in aged ad transgenic mice.
