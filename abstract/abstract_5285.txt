BACKGROUND
the atlantic salmon is an important aquaculture species and a very interesting species biologically, since it spawns in fresh water and develops through several stages before becoming a smolt, the stage at which it migrates to the sea to feed. the dramatic change of habitat requires physiological, morphological and behavioural changes to prepare the salmon for its new environment. these changes are called the parr-smolt transformation or smoltification, and pre-adapt the salmon for survival and growth in the marine environment. the development of hypo-osmotic regulatory ability plays an important part in facilitating the transition from rivers to the sea. the physiological mechanisms behind the developmental changes are largely unknown. an understanding of the transformation process will be vital to the future of the aquaculture industry. a knowledge of which genes are expressed prior to the smoltification process is an important basis for further studies.


RESULTS
in all,  <dig> unique sequences, consisting of  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets, were generated for atlantic salmon from two cdna libraries constructed from the gills and the intestine, accession numbers . nearly 50% of the sequences were assigned putative functions because they showed similarity to known genes, mostly from other species, in one or more of the databases used. the swiss-prot database returned significant hits for  <dig> sequences. these could be assigned predicted gene products, and  <dig> were annotated using gene ontology  terms for molecular function, biological process and/or cellular component, employing an annotation transfer procedure.


CONCLUSIONS
this paper describes the construction of two cdna libraries from pre-smolt atlantic salmon  and the subsequent est sequencing, clustering and assigning of putative function to  <dig> genes expressed in the gills and/or intestine.
