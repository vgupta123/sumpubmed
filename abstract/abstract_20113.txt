BACKGROUND
in order to find genetic and metabolic pathways related to phenotypic traits of interest, we analyzed gene expression data, metabolite data obtained with gc-ms and lc-ms, proteomics data and a selected set of tuber quality phenotypic data from a diploid segregating mapping population of potato. in this study we present an approach to integrate these ~ omics data sets for the purpose of predicting phenotypic traits. this gives us networks of relatively small sets of interrelated ~ omics variables that can predict, with higher accuracy, a quality trait of interest.


RESULTS
we used random forest regression for integrating multiple ~ omics data for prediction of four quality traits of potato: tuber flesh colour, dsc onset, tuber shape and enzymatic discoloration. for tuber flesh colour beta-carotene hydroxylase and zeaxanthin epoxidase were ranked first and forty-fourth respectively both of which have previously been associated with flesh colour in potato tubers. combining all the significant genes, lc-peaks, gc-peaks and proteins, the variation explained was 75 %, only slightly more than what gene expression or lc-ms data explain by themselves which indicates that there are correlations among the variables across data sets. for tuber shape regressed on the gene expression, lc-ms, gc-ms and proteomics data sets separately, only gene expression data was found to explain significant variation. for dsc onset, we found  <dig> significant gene expression,  <dig> metabolite levels  and  <dig> proteins that are associated with the trait. using those  <dig> significant variables, the variation explained was 45 %. expression qtl  analyses showed many associations with genomic regions in chromosome  <dig> with also the highest explained variation compared to other chromosomes. transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis on enzymatic discoloration after 5 min resulted in  <dig> significant genes and  <dig> significant lc metabolites, among which two were putatively identified as caffeoylquinic acid methyl ester and tyrosine.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we made a strategy for selecting and integrating multiple ~ omics data using random forest method and selected representative individual peaks for networks based on eqtl, mqtl or pqtl information. network analysis was done to interpret how a particular trait is associated with gene expression, metabolite and protein data.
