BACKGROUND
the response of the trout, o. mykiss, head kidney to bacterial lipopolysaccharide  or active and attenuated infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus  intraperitoneal challenge,  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-injection, was investigated using a salmonid-specific cdna microarray.


RESULTS
the head kidney response to i.p. lps-induced inflammation in the first instance displays an initial stress reaction involving suppression of major cellular processes, including immune function, followed by a proliferative hematopoietic-type/biogenesis response  <dig> days after administration. the viral response at the early stage of infection highlights a suppression of hematopoietic and protein biosynthetic function and a stimulation of immune response. in fish infected with ihnv a loss of cellular function including signal transduction, cell cycle and transcriptional activity  <dig> hours after infection reflects the tissue-specific pathology of ihnv infection. attihnv treatment on the other hand shows a similar pattern to native ihnv infection at  <dig> hours however at  <dig> hours a divergence from the viral response is seen and replace with a recovery response more similar to that observed for lps is observed.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion we have been able to identify and characterise by transcriptomic analysis two different types of responses to two distinct immune agents, a virus, ihnv and a bacterial cell wall component, lps and a 'mixed' response to an attenuated ihnv. this type of analysis will lead to a greater understanding of the physiological response and the development of effective immune responses in salmonid fish to different pathogenic and pro-inflammatory agents.
