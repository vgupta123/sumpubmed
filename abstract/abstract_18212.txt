BACKGROUND
the microarray has contributed to developing the omic analysis. however, as it depends basically on the surface reaction, it is hard to perform bulk reactions and sequential multistep reactions. on the other hand, the popular microplate technology, which has a great merit of being able to perform parallel multistep reactions, has come to its limit in increasing the number of wells  and reducing the volume to deal with due to the difficulty in operations.


RESULTS
here, we report a novel microarray technology which enables us to explore advanced applications, termed microarray-with-manageable volumes . the technical essence is in the pipette-free direct parallel transfer from well to well performed by centrifugation, evading the evaporation and adsorption-losses during handling. by developing the mmv plate, accompanying devices and techniques, generation of multiple conditions  and performance of parallel multistep reactions, including pcr and in vitro translation reactions, have been made possible. these were demonstrated by applying the mmv technology to searching lysozyme-crystallizing conditions and selecting peptides aimed for aβ-binding or cathepsin e-inhibition.


CONCLUSIONS
with the introduction of a novel concept microarray  technology, parallel and multistep reactions in sub-μl scale have become possible.
