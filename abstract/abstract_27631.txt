BACKGROUND
flux coupling analysis  is a useful method for finding dependencies between fluxes of a metabolic network at steady-state. fca classifies reactions into subsets  in which activity of one reaction implies activity of another reaction. several approaches for fca have been proposed in the literature.


RESULTS
we introduce a new fca algorithm, ffca , which is based on checking the feasibility of a system of linear inequalities. we show on a set of benchmarks that for genome-scale networks ffca is faster than other existing fca methods.


CONCLUSIONS
we present ffca as a new method for flux coupling analysis and prove it to be faster than existing approaches. a corresponding software tool is freely available for non-commercial use at http://www.bioinformatics.org/ffca/.
