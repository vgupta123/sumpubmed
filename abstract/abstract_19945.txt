BACKGROUND
we recently characterized hamo sine and its partner line in silver carp and bighead carp based on hybridization capture of repetitive elements from digested genomic dna in solution using a bead-probe  <cit> . to reveal the distribution and evolutionary history of sines and lines in cyprinid genomes, we performed a multi-species search for hamo sine and its partner line using the bead-probe capture and internal-primer-sine polymerase chain reaction  techniques.


RESULTS
sixty-seven full-size and  <dig> internal-sine sequences  from  <dig> species of the family cyprinidae were aligned as well as  <dig> new isolated hamol <dig> sequences. four subfamilies , which were divided based on diagnostic nucleotides in the trna-unrelated region, expanded preferentially within a certain lineage or within the whole family of cyprinidae as multiple active source genes. the copy numbers of hamo sines were estimated to vary from  <dig> to  <dig> in cyprinid genomes by quantitative rt-pcr. over one hundred type iv members were identified and characterized in the primitive cyprinid danio rerio genome but only tens of sequences were found to be similar with type i, ii and iii since the type iv was the oldest subfamily and its members dispersed in almost all investigated cyprinid fishes. for determining the taxonomic distribution of hamo sine, inter-primer sine pcr was conducted in other non-cyprinid fishes, the results shows that hamo sine- related sequences may disperse in other families of order cypriniforms but absent in other orders of bony fishes: siluriformes, polypteriformes, lepidosteiformes, acipenseriformes and osteoglossiforms.


CONCLUSIONS
depending on hamo line <dig>  multiple source genes  of hamo sine actively expanded and underwent retroposition in a certain lineage or within the whole family of cyprinidae. from this perspective, hamo sine should provide useful phylogenetic makers for future analyses of the evolutionary relationships among species in the family cyprinidae.
