BACKGROUND
mycoplasma sp.  <dig> can induce inflammation primarily in the genital and respiratory tracts of waterfowl, leading to serious economic losses. adequate housing and appropriate antibiotic treatment are promoted in the control of the disease. the aim of the present study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to thirteen different antibiotics and an antibiotic combination of thirty-eight m. sp.  <dig> strains isolated from geese and a duck in several parts of hungary, central europe between  <dig> and  <dig> 


RESULTS
high mic <dig> values were observed in the cases of tilmicosin , oxytetracycline , norfloxacin  and difloxacin . the examined strains yielded the same mic <dig> values with spectinomycin, tylosin and florfenicol , while enrofloxacin , doxycycline , lincomycin  and lincomycin-spectinomycin  combination  inhibited the growth of the bacteria with lower concentrations. tylvalosin  and two pleuromutilins  were found to be the most effective drugs against m. sp.  <dig>  however, strains with elevated mic values were detected for all applied antibiotics.


CONCLUSIONS
valnemulin, tiamulin and tylvalosin were found to be the most effective antibiotics in the study. increasing resistance was observed in the cases of several antibiotics. the results highlight the importance of testing mycoplasma species for antibiotic susceptibility before therapy.
