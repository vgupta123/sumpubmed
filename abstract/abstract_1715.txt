BACKGROUND
restriction enzyme-based reduced representation library  method represents a relatively feasible and flexible strategy used for single nucleotide polymorphism  identification in different species. it has remarkable advantage of reducing the complexity of the genome by orders of magnitude. however, comprehensive evaluation for actual efficacy of snp identification by this method is still unavailable.


RESULTS
in order to evaluate the efficacy of restriction enzyme-based rrl method, we selected tsp 45i enzyme which covers  <dig> mb flanking region of the enzyme recognition site according to in silico simulation on human reference genome, then we sequenced yh rrl after tsp 45i treatment and obtained reads of which  <dig> % were mapped to target region with an 20-fold average coverage, about  <dig> % of target region was covered by at least one read and  <dig> k snps were identified in the region using soapsnp software.

compared with whole genome resequencing data, we observed false discovery rate  of  <dig> % and false negative rate  of  <dig> %. the concordance rate of homozygote loci was over  <dig> %, but that of heterozygote were only  <dig> %. repeat sequences and bases quality were proved to have a great effect on the accuracy of snp calling, snps in recognition sites contributed evidently to the high fnr and the low concordance rate of heterozygote. our results indicated that repeat masking and high stringent filter criteria could significantly decrease both fdr and fnr.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that restriction enzyme-based rrl method was effective for snp identification. the results highlight the important role of bias and the method-derived defects represented in this method and emphasize the special attentions noteworthy.
