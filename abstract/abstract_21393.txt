BACKGROUND
gene duplication is a source of evolutionary innovation and can contribute to the divergence of lineages; however, the relative importance of this process remains to be determined. the explosive divergence of the african cichlid adaptive radiations provides both a model for studying the general role of gene duplication in the divergence of lineages and also an exciting foray into the identification of genomic features that underlie the dramatic phenotypic and ecological diversification in this particular lineage. we present the first genome-wide study of gene duplication in african cichlid fishes, identifying gene duplicates in three species belonging to the lake malawi adaptive radiation  and one closely related species from a non-radiated riverine lineage .


RESULTS
using astatotilapia burtoni as reference, microarray comparative genomic hybridization analysis of  <dig> genes reveals  <dig> duplicated genes among the four cichlid species tested. between  <dig> and  <dig> genes were identified as duplicated in each of the three species from the lake malawi radiation, representing a 38%â€“49% increase in number of duplicated genes relative to the non-radiated lineage . duplicated genes include several that are involved in immune response, atp metabolism and detoxification.


CONCLUSIONS
these results contribute to our understanding of the abundance and type of gene duplicates present in cichlid fish lineages. the duplicated genes identified in this study provide candidates for the analysis of functional relevance with regard to phenotype and divergence. comparative sequence analysis of gene duplicates can address the role of positive selection and adaptive evolution by gene duplication, while further study across the phylogenetic range of cichlid radiations  will determine whether the patterns of gene duplication seen in this study consistently accompany rapid radiation.
