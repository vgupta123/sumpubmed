BACKGROUND
genome-wide microarrays have been useful for predicting chemical-genetic interactions at the gene level. however, interpreting genome-wide microarray results can be overwhelming due to the vast output of gene expression data combined with off-target transcriptional responses many times induced by a drug treatment. this study demonstrates how experimental and computational methods can interact with each other, to arrive at more accurate predictions of drug-induced perturbations. we present a two-stage strategy that links microarray experimental testing and network training conditions to predict gene perturbations for a drug with a known mechanism of action in a well-studied organism.


RESULTS
s. cerevisiae cells were treated with the antifungal, fluconazole, and expression profiling was conducted under different biological conditions using affymetrix genome-wide microarrays. transcripts were filtered with a formal network-based method, sparse simultaneous equation models and lasso regression , under different network training conditions. gene expression results were evaluated using both gene set and single gene target analyses, and the drug’s transcriptional effects were narrowed first by pathway and then by individual genes. variables included:  testing conditions – exposure time and concentration and  network training conditions – training compendium modifications. two analyses of ssem-lasso output – gene set and single gene – were conducted to gain a better understanding of how ssem-lasso predicts perturbation targets.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that genome-wide microarrays can be optimized using a two-stage strategy for a more in-depth understanding of how a cell manifests biological reactions to a drug treatment at the transcription level. additionally, a more detailed understanding of how the statistical model, ssem-lasso, propagates perturbations through a network of gene regulatory interactions is achieved.
