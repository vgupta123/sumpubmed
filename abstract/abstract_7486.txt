BACKGROUND
in view of the importance of beta cells in glucose homeostasis and the profound repercussions of beta cell pathology on human health, the acquisition of tools to study pancreatic islet function is essential for the design of alternative novel therapies for diabetes. one promising approach toward this goal involves the modification of gene expression profile of beta cells.


RESULTS
this study describes a new method of gene and sirna delivery into human pancreatic islets by microporation technology. we demonstrated that mild islet distention with accutase greatly enhanced the transfection efficiency without compromising in vitro function . as an example, the recently identified gene involved in type  <dig> diabetes, znt <dig>  can be over-expressed or silenced by rna interference using this technology. microporation can also be used on rodent islets.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our results demonstrate that microporation technology can be used to modify gene expression in whole rodent and human islets without altering their in vitro function and will be key to the elucidation of the factors responsible for proper islet function.
