BACKGROUND
tses are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases occurring in man and animals. they are caused by prions, alternatively folded forms of the endogenous prion protein, encoded by prnp. since differences in the sequence of prnp can not explain all variation in tse susceptibility, there is growing interest in other genes that might have an influence on this susceptibility. one of these genes is sprn, a gene coding for a protein showing remarkable similarities with the prion protein. until now, sprn has not been described in sheep, a highly relevant species in prion matters.


RESULTS
in order to characterize the genomic region containing sprn in sheep, a bac mini-contig was built, covering approximately  <dig>  bp and containing the genes echs <dig>  paox, mtg <dig>  sprn, loc <dig>  cyp2e <dig> and at least partially syce <dig>  fish mapping of the two most exterior bac clones of the contig positioned this contig on oari22q <dig>  a fragment of  <dig>  bp was also sequenced, covering the entire sprn gene and  <dig> bp of the promoter region. in addition, the transcription profile of sprn in  <dig> tissues was determined by rt-pcr, showing high levels in cerebrum and cerebellum, and low levels in testis, lymph node, jejunum, ileum, colon and rectum.


CONCLUSIONS
annotation of a mini-contig including sprn suggests conserved linkage between oari22q <dig> and hsap10q <dig>  the ovine sprn sequence, described for the first time, shows a high level of homology with the bovine, and to a lesser extent with the human sprn sequence. in addition, transcription profiling in sheep reveals main expression of sprn in brain tissue, as in rat, cow, man and mouse.
