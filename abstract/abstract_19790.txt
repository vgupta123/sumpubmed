BACKGROUND
repetitive elements comprise ~45% of mammalian genomes and are increasingly known to impact genomic function by contributing to the genomic architecture, by direct regulation of gene expression and by affecting genomic size, diversity and evolution. the ubiquity and increasingly understood importance of repetitive elements contribute to the need to identify and annotate them. we set out to identify previously uncharacterized repetitive dna in the porcine genome. once found, we characterized the prevalence of these repeats in other mammals.


RESULTS
we discovered  <dig> repetitive elements in  <dig> bacs covering 1% of the porcine genome . these repeats varied in length from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides. to estimate copy numbers, we went to an independent source of data, the bac-end sequences , covering approximately 15% of the porcine genome. copy numbers in bac-ends were less than one hundred for  <dig> repeat elements, between  <dig> and  <dig> for  <dig> and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for  <dig>  several of the repeat elements were found in the bovine genome and we have identified two with orthologous sites, indicating that these elements were present in their common ancestor. none of the repeat elements were found in primate, rodent or dog genomes. we were unable to identify any of the replication machinery common to active transposable elements in these newly identified repeats.


CONCLUSIONS
the presence of both orthologous and non-orthologous sites indicates that some sites existed prior to speciation and some were generated later. the identification of low to moderate copy number repetitive dna that is specific to artiodactyls will be critical in the assembly of livestock genomes and studies of comparative genomics.
