BACKGROUND
the anaerobic spirochaete brachyspira pilosicoli causes enteric disease in avian, porcine and human hosts, amongst others. to date, the only available genome sequence of b. pilosicoli is that of strain 95/ <dig>  a porcine isolate. in the first intra-species genome comparison within the brachyspira genus, we report the whole genome sequence of b. pilosicoli b <dig>  an avian isolate, the incomplete genome sequence of b. pilosicoli wesb, a human isolate, and the comparisons with b. pilosicoli 95/ <dig>  we also draw on incomplete genome sequences from three other brachyspira species. finally we report the first application of the high-throughput biolog phenotype screening tool on the b. pilosicoli strains for detailed comparisons between genotype and phenotype.


RESULTS
feature and sequence genome comparisons revealed a high degree of similarity between the three b. pilosicoli strains, although the genomes of b <dig> and wesb were larger than that of 95/ <dig> . genome rearrangements were observed which correlated largely with the positions of mobile genetic elements. through comparison of the b <dig> and wesb genomes with the 95/ <dig> genome, features that we propose are non-essential due to their absence from 95/ <dig> include a peptidase, glycine reductase complex components and transposases. novel bacteriophages were detected in the newly-sequenced genomes, which appeared to have involvement in intra- and inter-species horizontal gene transfer. phenotypic differences predicted from genome analysis, such as the lack of genes for glucuronate catabolism in 95/ <dig>  were confirmed by phenotyping.


CONCLUSIONS
the availability of multiple b. pilosicoli genome sequences has allowed us to demonstrate the substantial genomic variation that exists between these strains, and provides an insight into genetic events that are shaping the species. in addition, phenotype screening allowed determination of how genotypic differences translated to phenotype. further application of such comparisons will improve understanding of the metabolic capabilities of brachyspira species.
