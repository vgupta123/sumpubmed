BACKGROUND
during abiotic stress many genes that are important for growth and adaptation to stress are expressed at elevated levels. however, the mechanisms that keep the stress responsive genes from expressing under non stress conditions remain elusive. recent genetic characterization of the co-repressor leunig_homolog  and transcriptional adaptor proteins seuss-like <dig>  and slk <dig> have been proposed to function redundantly in diverse developmental processes; however their function in the abiotic stress response is unknown. moreover, the molecular functions of luh, slk <dig> and slk <dig> remain obscure. here, we show the molecular function of luh, slk <dig> and slk <dig> and the role of this complex in the abiotic stress response.


RESULTS
the luh, slk <dig> and slk <dig> mutant plants shows enhanced tolerance to salt and osmotic stress conditions. slk <dig> and slk <dig> interact physically with the lufs domain in luh forming slk1-luh and slk2-luh co-repressor complexes to inhibit the transcription. luh has repressor activity, whereas slk <dig> and slk <dig> function as adaptors to recruit luh, which in turn recruits histone deacetylase to the target sequences to repress transcription. the stress response genes rd <dig>  myb <dig> and nac <dig> are expressed at elevated levels in the luh, slk <dig> and slk <dig> mutant plants. furthermore, these stress response genes are associated with decreased nucleosome density and increased acetylation levels at h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> in the luh, slk <dig> and slk <dig> mutant plants.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that slk <dig>  slk <dig> and luh form a co-repressor complex. luh represses by means of an epigenetic process involving histone modification to facilitate the condensation of chromatin thus preventing transcription at the target genes.
