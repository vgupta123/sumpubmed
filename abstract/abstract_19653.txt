BACKGROUND
an isolate originally labeled bacillus megaterium cdc  <dig> was found to contain both pxo <dig> and pxo <dig>  was non-hemolytic, sensitive to gamma-phage, and produced both the protective antigen and the poly-d-glutamic acid capsule. these phenotypes prompted ezzell et al.,  to reclassify this isolate to bacillus anthracis in  <dig> 


RESULTS
we demonstrate that despite these b. anthracis features, the isolate is severely attenuated in a guinea pig model. this prompted whole genome sequencing and closure. the comparative analysis of cdc  <dig> to other sequenced b. anthracis isolates and further analysis reveals: a) cdc  <dig> is a close relative of a virulent strain, vollum a0488; b) cdc  <dig> defines a new b. anthracis lineage  that includes  <dig> other isolates; c) the genome of cdc  <dig> contains a large chromosomal inversion that spans  <dig>  mbp; d) this inversion has caused a displacement of the usual spatial orientation of the origin of replication  to the termination of replication  from 180° in wild-type b. anthracis to 120° in cdc  <dig> and e) this isolate also has altered growth kinetics in liquid media.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose two alternative hypotheses explaining the attenuated phenotype of this isolate. hypothesis  <dig> suggests that the skewed ori/ter relationship in cdc  <dig> has altered its dna replication and/or transcriptome processes resulting in altered growth kinetics and virulence capacity. hypothesis  <dig> suggests that one or more of the single nucleotide polymorphisms in cdc  <dig> has altered the expression of a regulatory element or other genes necessary for virulence.
