BACKGROUND
a water based combination of  <dig> % octenidine dihydrochloride and 2%  <dig> - phenoxyethanol is registered in many european countries as an antiseptic solution  for topical treatment with high antimicrobial activity for human use, but octenidine based products have not been registered for veterinary use yet. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether octenidine dihydrochloride or  <dig> -phenoxyethanol, the two main components of this disinfectant, permeate through animal skin in vitro. therefore, permeation studies were conducted using franz-type diffusion cells.  <dig> ml of the test compound were applied onto  <dig>  cm <dig> split skin of cats, dogs, cows and horses. to simulate wounded skin, cattle skin was treated with adhesive tapes  <dig> times, as well. up to an incubation time of  <dig> hours samples of the acceptor chamber were taken and were analysed by uv-hplc. using the method of the external standard, the apparent permeability coefficient, the flux jmax, and the recovery were calculated. furthermore, the residues of both components in the skin samples were determined after completion of the diffusion experiment.


RESULTS
after  <dig> hours no octenidine dihydrochloride was found in the receptor chamber of intact skin samples, while  <dig> % of the topical applied octenidine dihydrochloride permeated through barrier disrupted cattle skin.  <dig> - phenoxyethanol permeated through all skin samples with the highest permeability in equine, followed by bovine, canine to feline skin. furthermore, both components were found in the stratum corneum and the dermis of all split skin samples with different amounts in the examined species.


CONCLUSIONS
for 2-phenoxyethanol the systemic impact of the high absorption rate and a potential toxicological risk have to be investigated in further studies. due to its low absorption rates through the skin, octenidine dihydrochloride is suitable for superficial skin treatment in the examined species.
