BACKGROUND
veterinary infection control for the management of hendra virus , an emerging zoonosis in australia, remained suboptimal until  <dig> despite  <dig> %  of humans infected with hev being veterinary personnel or assisting a veterinarian, three of whom died before  <dig>  the aim of this study was to identify the perceived barriers to veterinary infection control and hev management in private veterinary practice in queensland, where the majority of hev outbreaks have occurred in australia.


RESULTS
most participants agreed that a number of key factors had contributed to the slow uptake of adequate infection control measures for the management of hev amongst private veterinarians: a work culture characterised by suboptimal infection control standards and misconceptions about zoonotic risks; a lack of leadership and support from government authorities; the difficulties of managing biosecurity and public health issues from a private workforce perspective; and the slow pattern of emergence of hev. by  <dig>  some infection control and hev management changes had been implemented. participants interviewed agreed that further improvements remained necessary; but also cautioned that this was a complex process which would require time.


CONCLUSIONS
private veterinarians and government authorities prior to  <dig> were unprepared to handle new slowly emerging zoonoses, which may explain their mismanagement of hev. slowly emerging zoonoses may be of low public health significance but of high significance for specialised groups such as veterinarians. private veterinarians, who are expected to fulfil an active biosecurity and public health role in the frontline management of such emerging zoonoses, need government agencies to better recognise their contribution, to consult with the veterinary profession when devising guidelines for the management of zoonoses and to provide them with greater leadership and support. we propose that specific infection control guidelines for the management of slowly emerging zoonoses in private veterinary settings need to be developed.
