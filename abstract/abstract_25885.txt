BACKGROUND
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  is the predominant cause of bone infection. toll like receptors  are an important segments of host response to infection and are expressed by a variety of cells including human mesenchymal stem cells . the active form of vitamin d,  <dig> -dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> 2d3) has potent immunoregulatory properties, but the mechanism remains poorly understood. the genomic action of  <dig> d <dig> is mediated by vitamin d receptor , hormone-regulated transcription factor. vdr interacts with co-activators and co-repressors are associated with chromatin histone modifications and transcriptional regulation. the aim of our study is to explore mrsa-induced tlrs-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokines expression in hmscs. further, we hypothesized that  <dig> d <dig> inhibits mrsa-induced cytokines synthesis in hmscs via inhibition of nf-кb transcription factor. finally, we explored the regulatory role of  <dig> d <dig> in mrsa-mediated global epigenetic histone h <dig> mark, such as, trimethylated histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> , which is linked to gene silencing.


RESULTS
quantitative pcr data revealed that mrsa-infection predominantly induced expression of tlrs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  nr4a <dig>  and inflammatory cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnfα in hmscs. mrsa-mediated tlr ligands reduced osteoblast differentiation and increased hmscs proliferation, indicating the disrupted multipotency function of hmscs. pretreatment of  <dig> d <dig> followed by mrsa co-culture inhibited nuclear translocation of nf-кb-p <dig>  reduced expression of nr4a <dig> and pro-inflammatory cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnfα in hmscs. further, nf-κb-p <dig>  vdr, and nr4a <dig> were present in the same nuclear protein complex, indicating that vdr is an active part of the nuclear protein complexes for transcriptional regulation. finally,  <dig> d <dig> activated vdr, restores the global level of h3k9me <dig>  to repress mrsa-stimulated inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> expression. pretreatment of 5-daza, dna methylatransferases  inhibitor, dramatically re-expresses  <dig> d3-mrsa-mediated silenced il- <dig> gene.


CONCLUSIONS
this data indicates that tlr  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> can be used as markers for localized s. aureus bone infection.  <dig> d3-vdr may exhibits its anti-inflammatory properties in mrsa-stimulated infection by inhibiting nuclear translocation of nf-kb-p <dig> and transcripts of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnfα, and nr4a <dig> in hmscs. finally,  <dig> d3-activated vdr, acting as an epigenetic regulator, inhibits synthesis of cytokines in mrsa-stimulated infection by restoring the global level of h3k9me <dig>  a histone h <dig> mark for gene silencing.
