BACKGROUND
a questionnaire survey was conducted to assess the biosecurity and other practices of backyard poultry holdings and knowledge and practices of poultry keepers following an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza  virus in poultry in thimphu city area, bhutan.


RESULTS
the study identified  <dig> backyard poultry holdings in  <dig> settlement areas, and the owners were subsequently interviewed. the birds are kept in a low-input low-output system, fed locally available scavenging feed base, and supplemented with food scraps and some grain. although the birds are housed at night in a small coop to protect them against theft and predators, they are let loose during the day to scavenge in the homestead surroundings. this invariably results in mixing with other poultry birds within the settlement and wild birds, creating favorable conditions for disease spread within and between flocks. moreover, the poultry keepers have a low level of knowledge and awareness related to the importance of biosecurity measures, as well as veterinary care of the birds and reporting systems. of particular concern is that sick birds within backyard holdings may not be detected rapidly, resulting in silent spread of disease and increased risk of humans contacting the virus  from infected poultry. nevertheless, all the respondents have indicated that they know and practice hand washing using soap and water after handling poultry and poultry products, but rarely use face-masks and hand gloves while handling poultry or cleaning poultry house.


CONCLUSIONS
this study highlights the importance of educating poultry keepers to improve the housing and management systems of poultry farming within the backyard holdings in the thimphu city area in order to prevent future disease outbreaks.
