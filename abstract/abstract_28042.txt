BACKGROUND
the transcription factor c-myb is expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells and other rapidly proliferating tissues, regulating genes important for proliferation, differentiation and survival. the dna-binding domain  of c-myb contains three tandemly arranged imperfect repeats, designated myb domain r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig>  the three-dimensional structure of the dbd shows that only the second and third myb domains are directly involved in sequence-specific dna-binding, while the r <dig> repeat does not contact dna and only marginally affects dna-binding properties. no structural information is available on the n-terminal  <dig> residues. since deletion of the n-terminal region including r <dig> plays an important role in oncogenic activation of c-myb, we asked whether this region confers properties beyond dna-binding to the neighbouring c-myb dbd.


RESULTS
analysis of a putative rna-binding function of c-myb dbd revealed that poly preferentially inhibited c-myb dna-binding. a strong sequence-selectivity was observed when different rna polymers were compared. most interesting, the poly sensitivity was significantly larger for a protein containing the n-terminus and the r1-repeat than for the minimal dna-binding domain.


CONCLUSIONS
preferential inhibition of c-myb dna binding by poly rna suggests that c-myb is able to interact with rna in a sequence-selective manner. while r <dig> and r <dig>  but not r <dig>  are necessary for dna-binding, r <dig> seems to have a distinct role in enhancing the rna-sensitivity of c-myb.
