BACKGROUND
bidirectional gene pairs are highly abundant and mostly co-regulated in eukaryotic genomes. the structural features of bidirectional promoters  have been well studied in yeast, humans and plants. however, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the coexpression of bdps remain understudied, especially in plants.


RESULTS
here, we characterized chromatin features associated with rice bdps. several unique chromatin features were present in rice bdps but were missing from unidirectional promoters , including overrepresented active histone marks, canonical nucleosomes and underrepresented h3k27me <dig>  in particular, overrepresented active marks  were truly overrepresented in type i bdps but not in the other two bdps, based on a kolmogorov-smirnov test.


CONCLUSIONS
our analyses indicate that active marks  may coordinate with repressive marks  to build a unique chromatin structure that favors the coregulation of bidirectional gene pairs. thus, our findings help to enhance the understanding of unique epigenetic mechanisms that regulate bidirectional gene pairs and may improve the manipulation of gene pairs for crop bioengineering.
