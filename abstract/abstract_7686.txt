BACKGROUND
since human brain tissue is often unavailable for transcriptional profiling studies, blood expression data is frequently used as a substitute. the underlying hypothesis in such studies is that genes expressed in brain tissue leave a transcriptional footprint in blood. we tested this hypothesis by relating three human brain expression data sets  to two large human blood expression data sets .


RESULTS
we found mean expression levels were weakly correlated between the brain and blood data . further, we tested whether co-expression relationships were preserved between the three brain regions and blood. only a handful of brain co-expression modules showed strong evidence of preservation and these modules could be combined into a single large blood module. we also identified highly connected intramodular "hub" genes inside preserved modules. these preserved intramodular hub genes had the following properties: first, their expression levels tended to be significantly more heritable than those from non-preserved intramodular hub genes ; second, they had highly significant positive correlations with the following cluster of differentiation genes: cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd164; third, a significant number of them were known to be involved in infection mechanisms, post-transcriptional and post-translational modification and other basic processes.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, we find transcriptome organization is poorly preserved between brain and blood. however, the subset of preserved co-expression relationships characterized here may aid future efforts to identify blood biomarkers for neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases when brain tissue samples are unavailable.
