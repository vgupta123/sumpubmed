BACKGROUND
viability staining with syto <dig> and propidium iodide  is a frequently used tool in microbiological studies. however, data generated by such routinely used method are often not critically evaluated for their accuracy. in this study we aim to investigate the critical aspects of this staining method using staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa as the model microorganisms for high throughput studies in microtiter plates. syto <dig> or pi was added alone or consecutively together to cells and the fluorescence intensities were measured using microplate reader and confocal laser scanning microscope.


RESULTS
we found that staining of s. aureus cells with syto <dig> alone resulted in equal signal intensity for both live and dead cells, whereas staining of p. aeruginosa cells led to 18-fold stronger signal strength for dead cells than for live ones. after counterstaining with pi, the dead p. aeruginosa cells still exhibited stronger syto <dig> signal than the live cells. we also observed that syto <dig> signal showed strong bleaching effect and decreased dramatically over time. pi intensity of the culture increased linearly with the increase of dead cell numbers, however, the maximum intensities were rather weak compared to syto <dig> and background values. thus, slight inaccuracy in measurement of pi signal could have significant effect on the outcome.


CONCLUSIONS
when viability staining with syto <dig> and pi is performed, several factors need to be considered such as the bleaching effect of syto <dig>  different binding affinity of syto <dig> to live and dead cells and background fluorescence.
