BACKGROUND
information on nucleotide diversity along completely sequenced human genomes has increased tremendously over the last few years. this makes it possible to reassess the diversity status of distinct receptor proteins in different human individuals. to this end, we focused on the complete inventory of human olfactory receptor coding regions as a model for personal receptor repertoires.


RESULTS
by performing data-mining from public and private sources we scored genetic variations in  <dig> intact or loci, for which one or more individuals had an intact open reading frame. using  <dig> genomes project haplotypes, we identified a total of  <dig> full-length polypeptide variants encoded by these or loci, average of ~ <dig> per locus, constituting a lower limit for the effective human or repertoire. each individual is found to harbor as many as  <dig> or allelic variants, ~50% higher than the locus count. because or neuronal expression is allelically excluded, this has direct effect on smell perception diversity of the species. we further identified  <dig> or segregating pseudogenes , loci showing both intact and pseudogene forms in the population, twenty-six of which are annotatively “resurrected” from a pseudogene status in the reference genome. using a custom snp microarray we validated  <dig> spgs in a cohort of  <dig> individuals, with every individual genome averaging  <dig> disrupted sequence variations,  <dig> in homozygote form. finally, we generated a multi-source compendium of  <dig> or loci harboring deletion copy number variations . our combined data suggest that  <dig> of the  <dig> intact or loci  are affected by nonfunctional snps/indels and/or cnvs.


CONCLUSIONS
these results portray a case of unusually high genetic diversity, and suggest that individual humans have a highly personalized inventory of functional olfactory receptors, a conclusion that might apply to other receptor multigene families.
