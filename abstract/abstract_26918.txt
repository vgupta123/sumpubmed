BACKGROUND
in recent times photodynamic antimicrobial therapy has been used to efficiently destroy gram  and gram  bacteria using cationic porphyrins as photosensitizers. there is an increasing interest in this approach, namely in the search of photosensitizers with adequate structural features for an efficient photoinactivation process. in this study we propose to compare the efficiency of seven cationic porphyrins differing in meso-substituent groups, charge number and charge distribution, on the photodynamic inactivation of a gram  bacterium  and of a gram  bacterium . the present study complements our previous work on the search for photosensitizers that might be considered good candidates for the photoinactivation of a large spectrum of environmental microorganisms.


RESULTS
bacterial suspension  treated with different photosensitizers concentrations  were exposed to white light  for a total light dose of  <dig>  j cm- <dig>  the most effective photosensitizers against both bacterial strains were the tri-py+-me-pf and tri-py+-me-co2me at  <dig>  Î¼m with a light fluence of  <dig>  j cm- <dig>  leading to >  <dig>  log  of photoinactivation. the tetracationic porphyrin also proved to be a good photosensitizer against both bacterial strains. both di-cationic and the monocationic porphyrins were the least effective ones.


CONCLUSIONS
the number of positive charges, the charge distribution in the porphyrins' structure and the meso-substituent groups seem to have different effects on the photoinactivation of both bacteria. as the tri-py+-me-pf porphyrin provides the highest log reduction using lower light doses, this photosensitizer can efficiently photoinactivate a large spectrum of environmental bacteria. the complete inactivation of both bacterial strains with low light fluence  means that the photodynamic approach can be applied to wastewater treatment under natural light conditions which makes this technology cheap and feasible in terms of the light source.
