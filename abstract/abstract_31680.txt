BACKGROUND
mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis  is the etiological agent of paratuberculosis. the aim of our study was to combine mini-and microsatellite loci analysis in order to explore the effectiveness of this sub-typing method in a group of map isolates. for this purpose,  <dig> italian type c map isolates, each from a different cattle herd, were submitted to miru-variable-number tandem-repeats  typing and short sequence repeats  sequencing. moreover, the method was used to analyse the variability inside  <dig> herds .


RESULTS
the molecular sub-typing, carried out using three ssr and  <dig> miru-vntr loci, differentiated the  <dig> isolates into  <dig> clusters, reaching a simpson's discriminatory index  value of  <dig>  . among all considered loci, six  showed relevant allelic variability. thirty-eight% of the isolates were clustered into four genotypes, differing from each other for the ssr <dig> locus. the other isolates, characterised by differences in two or more loci, were spread among the rest of the clusters. the intra-herd analysis revealed more than one genotype in most herds with a similar distribution of clusters.


CONCLUSIONS
our results revealed the advantage of using both mini-and microsatellite approaches for successfully discriminating among map type c isolates from the same geographic area, host species and herd. these data suggest that the combination of loci here proposed could be a useful molecular tool for regional epidemiological studies.
