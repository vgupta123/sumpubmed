BACKGROUND
fused genes are important sources of data for studies of evolution and protein function. to date no service has been made available online to aid in the large-scale identification of fused genes in sequenced genomes. we have developed a program, gene defuser, that analyzes uploaded protein sequence files for characteristics of gene fusion events and presents the results in a convenient web interface.


RESULTS
to test the ability of this software to detect fusions on a genome-wide scale, we analyzed the  <dig>  gene models predicted for the ciliated protozoan tetrahymena thermophila. gene defuser detected members of eight of the nine families of gene fusions known or predicted in this species and identified nineteen new families of fused genes, each containing between one and twelve members. in addition to these genuine fusions, gene defuser also detected a particular type of gene misannotation, in which two independent genes were predicted as a single transcript by gene annotation tools. twenty-nine of the artifacts detected by gene defuser in the initial annotation have been corrected in subsequent versions, with a total of  <dig> annotation artifacts  remaining in the most recent annotation.


CONCLUSIONS
the newly identified tetrahymena fusions belong to classes of genes involved in processes such as phospholipid synthesis, nuclear export, and surface antigen generation. these results highlight the potential of gene defuser to reveal a large number of novel fused genes in evolutionarily isolated organisms. gene defuser may also prove useful as an ancillary tool for detecting fusion artifacts during gene model annotation.
