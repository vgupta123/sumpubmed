BACKGROUND
ksrp is a au-rich element  binding protein that causes decay of select sets of transcripts in different cell types. we have recently described that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/akt  activation induces stabilization and accumulation of the labile β-catenin mrna through an impairment of ksrp function.


RESULTS
aim of this study was to identify additional ksrp targets whose stability and steady-state levels are enhanced by pi3k-akt activation. first, through microarray analyses of the au-rich transcriptome in pituitary αt3- <dig> cells, we identified  <dig> are-containing transcripts upregulated in cells expressing a constitutively active form of akt <dig>  in parallel, by an affinity chromatography-based technique followed by microarray analyses,  <dig> mrnas target of ksrp, additional to β-catenin, were identified. among them, seven mrnas were upregulated in cells expressing activated akt <dig>  both steady-state levels and stability of these new ksrp targets were consistently increased by either ksrp knock-down or pi3k-akt activation.


CONCLUSIONS
our study identified a set of transcripts that are targets of ksrp and whose expression is increased by pi3k-akt activation. these mrnas encode rna binding proteins, signaling molecules and a replication-independent histone. the increased expression of these gene products upon pi3k-akt activation could play a role in the cellular events initiated by this signaling pathway.
