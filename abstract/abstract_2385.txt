BACKGROUND
pyoverdines  are high affinity siderophores, for which the molecular mechanisms of biosynthesis, uptake and regulation have been extensively studied in pseudomonas aeruginosa pao <dig>  however, the extent to which this regulatory model applies to other pseudomonads is unknown. here, we describe the results of a genomic, genetic and structural analysis of pyoverdine-mediated iron uptake by the plant growth-promoting bacterium p. fluorescens sbw <dig> 


RESULTS
in silico analysis of the complete, but un-annotated, sbw <dig> genome sequence identified  <dig> genes putatively involved in pvd biosynthesis, transport or regulation, which are distributed across seven different regions of the genome. pvd gene iron-responsiveness was tested using 'lacz fusions to five pvd loci, representative of structural and regulatory genes. transcription of all fusions increased in response to iron starvation. in silico analyses suggested that regulation of fpvr  may be unique. transcriptional assays using gene expression constructs showed that fpvr is positively regulated by fpvi  sigma factor), and not directly by the ferric uptake regulator  as for pao <dig>  deletion of pvdl, encoding a predicted non-ribosomal peptide synthetase  involved in pvd chromophore biosynthesis confirmed the necessity of pvdl for pvd production and for normal growth in iron-limited media. structural analysis of the sbw <dig> pvd shows a partly cyclic seven residue peptide backbone, identical to that of p. fluorescens atcc <dig>  at least  <dig> putative siderophore receptor genes are present in the sbw <dig> genome enabling the bacterium to utilize  <dig> structurally distinct pvds from  <dig> different pseudomonas isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
the genome of p. fluorescens sbw <dig> contains an extensively dispersed set of pvd genes in comparison to other sequenced pseudomonas strains. the pao <dig> pvd regulatory model, which involves a branched fpv signaling pathway, is generally conserved in sbw <dig>  however there is a significant difference in fpvr regulation. sbw <dig> produces pvd with a partly cyclic seven amino acid residue backbone, and is able to utilize a wide variety of exogenous pvds.
