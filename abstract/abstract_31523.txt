BACKGROUND
equine incisors are subjected to continuous occlusal wear causing multiple, age related changes of the extragingival crown. it is assumed that the occlusal wear is compensated by continued tooth elongation at the apical ends of the teeth. in this study, μct-datasets offered the opportunity to analyze the three-dimensional appearance of the extra- and intraalveolar parts of the enamel containing dental crown as well as of the enamel-free dental root. multiple morphometric measurements elucidated age related, morphological changes within the intraalveolar part of the incisors.


RESULTS
equine incisors possess a unique enamel cover displaying large indentations on the mesial and distal sides. after eruption tooth elongation at the apical end outbalances occlusal wear for two to four years resulting in increasing incisor length in this period of time. remarkably, this maximum length is maintained for about ten years, up to a tooth age of  <dig> to 15 years post eruption. variances in the total length of individual teeth are related to different triadan positions  as well as to the upper and lower arcades.


CONCLUSIONS
equine incisors are able to fully compensate occlusal wear for a limited period of time. however, after this ability ceases, it is expected that a diminished intraalveolar tooth length will cause massive changes in periodontal biomechanics. the time point of these morphodynamic and biomechanical changes  occurs in coincidence with the onset of a recently described destructive disease of equine incisor  in aged horses. however, further biomechanical, cell biological and microbiological investigations are needed to elucidate a correlation between age related changes of incisor morphology and this disease.
