BACKGROUND
the recent settlement of cattle in west africa after several waves of migration from remote centres of domestication has imposed dramatic changes in their environmental conditions, in particular through exposure to new pathogens. west african cattle populations thus represent an appealing model to unravel the genome response to adaptation to tropical conditions. the purpose of this study was to identify footprints of adaptive selection at the whole genome level in a newly collected data set comprising  <dig>  snps genotyped in  <dig> west african cattle populations.


RESULTS
after a detailed analysis of population structure, we performed a scan for snp differentiation via a previously proposed bayesian procedure including extensions to improve the detection of loci under selection. based on these results we identified  <dig> genomic regions and  <dig> strong candidate genes. their physiological functions were mainly related to immune response , nervous system  and skin and hair properties .


CONCLUSIONS
the main possible underlying selective pressures may be related to climatic conditions but also to the host response to pathogens such as trypanosoma. overall, these results might open the way towards the identification of important variants involved in adaptation to tropical conditions and in particular to resistance to tropical infectious diseases.
