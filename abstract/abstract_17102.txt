BACKGROUND
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses  are collectively the most common type of recessively inherited childhood encephalopathies. the most severe form of ncl, infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis , is caused by mutations in the cln <dig> gene, resulting in a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme, palmitoyl protein thioesterase  <dig> . the deficiency of ppt <dig> causes a specific death of neocortical neurons by a mechanism, which is currently unclear. to understand the function of ppt <dig> in more detail, we have further analyzed the basic properties of the protein, especially focusing on possible differences in non-neuronal and neuronal cells.


RESULTS
our study shows that the n-glycosylation of n <dig> and n <dig>  but not n <dig>  is essential for ppt1's activity and intracellular transport. deglycosylation of overexpressed ppt <dig> produced in neurons and fibroblasts demonstrates differentially modified ppt <dig> in different cell types. furthermore, antibody internalization assays showed differences in ppt <dig> transport when compared with a thoroughly characterized lysosomal enzyme aspartylglucosaminidase , an important observation potentially influencing therapeutic strategies. ppt <dig> was also demonstrated to form oligomers by size-exclusion chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assays. finally, the consequences of disease mutations were analyzed in the perspective of our new results, suggesting that the mutations increase both the degree of glycosylation of ppt <dig> and its ability to form complexes.


CONCLUSIONS
our current study describes novel properties for ppt <dig>  we observe differences in ppt <dig> processing and trafficking in neuronal and non-neuronal cells, and describe for the first time the ability of ppt <dig> to form complexes. understanding the basic characteristics of ppt <dig> is fundamental in order to clarify the molecular pathogenesis behind neurodegeneration in incl.
