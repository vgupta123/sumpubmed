BACKGROUND
a common finding amongst patients with inhalational anthrax is a paucity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes  in infected tissues in the face of abundant circulating pmns. a major virulence determinant of anthrax is edema toxin , which is formed by the combination of two proteins produced by the organism, edema factor , which is an adenyl cyclase, and protective antigen . since camp, a product of adenyl cyclase, is known to enhance endothelial barrier integrity, we asked whether et might decrease extravasation of pmns into tissues through closure of the paracellular pathway through which pmns traverse.


RESULTS
pretreatment of human microvascular endothelial cells of the lung  with et decreased interleukin -8-driven transendothelial migration  of pmns with a maximal reduction of nearly 60%. this effect required the presence of both ef and pa. conversely, et did not diminish pmn chemotaxis in an ec-free system. pretreatment of subconfluent hmvec-ls decreased transendothelial  <dig> c-albumin flux by ~ 50% compared to medium controls. coadministration of et with either tumor necrosis factor-Î± or bacterial lipopolysaccharide, each at  <dig> ng/ml, attenuated the increase of transendothelial  <dig> c-albumin flux caused by either agent alone. the inhibitory effect of et on tem paralleled increases in protein kinase a  activity, but could not be blocked by inhibition of pka with either h- <dig> or kt- <dig>  finally, we were unable to replicate the et effect with either forskolin or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, two agents known to increase camp.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that et decreases il-8-driven tem of pmns across hmvec-l monolayers independent of camp/pka activity.
