BACKGROUND
inorganic polyphosphate , linear chains of phosphate residues linked by energy rich phosphoanhydride bonds, is found in every cell and organelle and is abundant in algae. depending on its localization and concentration, poly p is involved in various biological functions. it serves, for example, as a phosphate store and buffer against alkali, is involved in energy metabolism and regulates the activity of enzymes. bacteria defective in poly p synthesis are impaired in biofilm development, motility and pathogenicity. polyp has also been found in fungal cell walls and bacterial envelopes, but has so far not been measured directly or stained specifically in the cell wall of any plant or alga.


RESULTS
here, we demonstrate the presence of poly p in the cell wall of chlamydomonas reinhardtii by staining with specific poly p binding proteins. the specificity of the poly p signal was verified by various competition experiments, by staining with different poly p binding proteins and by correlation with biochemical quantification. microscopical investigation at different time-points during growth revealed fluctuations of the poly p signal synchronous with the cell cycle: the poly p staining peaked during late cytokinesis and was independent of the high intracellular poly p content, which fluctuated only slightly during the cell cycle.


CONCLUSIONS
the presented staining method provides a specific and sensitive tool for the study of poly p in the extracellular matrices of algae and could be used to describe the dynamic behaviour of cell wall poly p during the cell cycle. we assume that cell wall poly p and intracellular poly p are regulated by distinct mechanisms and it is suggested that cell wall bound poly p might have important protective functions against toxic compounds or pathogens during cytokinesis, when cells are more vulnerable.
