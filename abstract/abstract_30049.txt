BACKGROUND
maintenance of genome stability is critical in human cells. mutations in or loss of genome stability pathways can lead to a number of pathologies including cancer. hssb <dig> is a critical dna repair protein functioning in the repair and signalling of stalled dna replication forks, double strand dna breaks and oxidised dna lesions. the blm helicase is central to the repair of both collapsed dna replication forks and double strand dna breaks by homologous recombination.


RESULTS
in this study, we demonstrate that hssb <dig> and blm helicase form a complex in cells and the interaction is altered in response to ionising radiation . blm and hssb <dig> also co-localised at nuclear foci following ir-induced double strand breaks and stalled replication forks. we show that hssb <dig> depleted cells contain less blm protein and that this deficiency is due to proteasome mediated degradation of blm. consequently, there is a defect in recruitment of blm to chromatin in response to ionising radiation-induced dsbs and to hydroxyurea-induced stalled and collapsed replication forks.


CONCLUSIONS
our data highlights that blm helicase and hssb <dig> function in a dynamic complex in cells and that this complex is likely required for blm protein stability and function.
