BACKGROUND
muscle enzymes in saliva have been reported to be possible markers of heart and muscle damage in humans. the aim of this study was to assess if creatine kinase  and aspartate aminotransferase  activities could be measured in canine saliva, and to evaluate their possible changes in situations of muscle damage.


RESULTS
the spectrophotometric assays for ck and ast measurement in saliva of dogs showed intra- and inter-assay imprecision lower than  <dig> and 16% and coefficients of correlation close to  <dig> in linearity under dilution tests. healthy dogs showed activities in saliva of ck between  <dig> and 121 u/l and ast between  <dig> and 144 u/l, whereas in saliva of dogs with muscle damage ck ranged between  <dig> and 3862 u/l and ast between  <dig> and 4340 u/l. positive moderate correlations were found between saliva and serum activities of the two enzymes .


CONCLUSIONS
ck and ast activities can be measured in canine saliva with commercially available spectrophotometric assays. in addition these enzymes show higher values in saliva of dogs with muscle damage and their values are moderately correlated with those of serum.
