BACKGROUND
although staphylococcus aureus is considered the main etiological agent of infectious mastitis, recent studies have suggested that coagulase-negative staphylococci  may also play an important role in such infections. the aims of this work were to isolate staphylococci from milk of women with lactational mastitis, to select and characterize the cns isolates, and to compare such properties with those displayed by cns strains isolated from milk of healthy women.


RESULTS
the milk of  <dig> women was collected and bacterial growth was noted in  <dig> of them, of which staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated from  <dig> patients and s. aureus from  <dig>  among the  <dig> staphylococcal isolates recovered from milk of women with mastitis,  <dig> were identified as staphylococcus epidermidis by phenotypic assays, species-specific pcr and pcr sequencing. they were typified by pulsed field gel electrophoresis  genotyping. the pfge profiles of the s. epidermidis strains were compared with those of  <dig> isolates from milk of healthy women. a representative of the  <dig> different pfge profiles was selected to study the incidence of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance. the number of strains that contained the biofilm-related icad gene and that showed resistance to oxacillin, erythromycin, clindamycin and mupirocin was significantly higher among the strains isolated from mastitic milk.


CONCLUSIONS
s. epidermidis may be a frequent but largely underrated cause of infectious mastitis in lactating women. the resistance to diverse antibiotics and a higher ability to form biofilms found among the strains isolated from milk of women suffering mastitis may explain the chronic and/or recurrent nature of this infectious condition.
