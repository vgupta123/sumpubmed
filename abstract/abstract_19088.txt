BACKGROUND
acidity is a major contributor to fruit quality. several organic acids are present in apple fruit, but malic acid is predominant and determines fruit acidity. the trait is largely controlled by the malic acid  locus, underpinning which ma <dig> that putatively encodes a vacuolar aluminum-activated malate transporter <dig> -like protein is a strong candidate gene. we hypothesize that fruit acidity is governed by a gene network in which ma <dig> is key member. the goal of this study is to identify the gene network and the potential mechanisms through which the network operates.


RESULTS
guided by ma <dig>  we analyzed the transcriptomes of mature fruit of contrasting acidity from six apple accessions of genotype ma_  and four of mama using rna-seq and identified  <dig> fruit acidity associated genes, among which  <dig> were most significant acidity genes . network inferring using weighted gene co-expression network analysis  revealed five co-expression gene network modules of significant  correlation with malate. of these, the ma <dig> containing module  of  <dig> genes showed the highest correlation . we also identified  <dig> intramodular hub genes from each of the five modules and  <dig> enriched gene ontology  terms and mapman sub-bines, including two go terms  and two mapmap sub-bins  related to photosynthesis in module turquoise. using lemon-tree algorithms, we identified  <dig> regulator genes of probabilistic scores  <dig> – <dig> , including mdp <dig> , mdp <dig>  and mdp <dig>  of greater interest for being one of the  <dig> msags or one of the  <dig> intramodular hub genes in turquoise, and/or a regulator to the cluster containing ma <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the most relevant finding of this study is the identification of the msags, intramodular hub genes, enriched photosynthesis related processes, and regulator genes in a wgcna module turquoise that not only encompasses ma <dig> but also shows the highest modular correlation with acidity. overall, this study provides important insight into the ma1-mediated gene network controlling acidity in mature apple fruit of diverse genetic background.
