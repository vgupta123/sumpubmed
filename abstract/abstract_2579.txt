BACKGROUND
serogroup b meningococcal  isolates currently account for approximately 90% of invasive meningococcal disease  in greece with st- <dig> clonal complex predominating. the potential of a multicomponent meningococcal b vaccine  recently licensed in europe was investigated in order to find whether the aforementioned vaccine will cover the menb strains circulating in greece. a panel of  <dig> serogroup b invasive meningococcal strains was characterized by multilocus sequence typing  and pora subtyping. vaccine components were typed by sequencing for factor h-binding protein , neisserial heparin binding antigen  and neisseria adhesin a . their expression was explored by meningococcal antigen typing system .


RESULTS
global strain coverage predicted by mats was  <dig> %  with  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of strains covered by one, two and three vaccine antigens respectively. nhba was the antigen responsible for the highest coverage , followed by fhbp , pora  and nada . the coverage of the major genotypes did not differ significantly. the most prevalent mlst genotype was the st- <dig> clonal complex , accounting for  <dig> % of the strains in the panel and with a predicted coverage of  <dig> %, mainly due to nhba and fhbp.


CONCLUSIONS
4cmenb has the potential to protect against a significant proportion of greek invasive menb strains.
