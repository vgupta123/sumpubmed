BACKGROUND
mathematical modelling of cellular networks is an integral part of systems biology and requires appropriate software tools. an important class of methods in systems biology deals with structural or topological  analysis of cellular networks. so far, software tools providing such methods for both mass-flow  as well as signal-flow  networks are lacking.


RESULTS
herein we introduce cellnetanalyzer, a toolbox for matlab facilitating, in an interactive and visual manner, a comprehensive structural analysis of metabolic, signalling and regulatory networks. the particular strengths of cellnetanalyzer are methods for functional network analysis, i.e. for characterising functional states, for detecting functional dependencies, for identifying intervention strategies, or for giving qualitative predictions on the effects of perturbations. cellnetanalyzer extends its predecessor fluxanalyzer  by a new modelling framework for examining signal-flow networks. two of the novel methods implemented in cellnetanalyzer are discussed in more detail regarding algorithmic issues and applications: the computation and analysis  of shortest positive and shortest negative paths and circuits in interaction graphs and  of minimal intervention sets in logical networks.


CONCLUSIONS
cellnetanalyzer provides a single suite to perform structural and qualitative analysis of both mass-flow- and signal-flow-based cellular networks in a user-friendly environment. it provides a large toolbox with various, partially unique, functions and algorithms for functional network analysis.cellnetanalyzer is freely available for academic use.
