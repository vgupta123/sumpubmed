BACKGROUND
the adaptive immune system  of jawed vertebrates is a sophisticated system mediated by numerous genes in specialized cells. phylogenetic analysis indicates that emergence of the ais followed the occurrence of two rounds of whole-genome duplication  in early vertebrates, but little direct evidence linking these two events is available.


RESULTS
we examined the relationship between 2r-wgd and the gain of ais-related functions by numerous genes. to analyze the evolution of the many genes related to signal transduction in the ais , we identified groups of genes  that included at least one human ais gene, its paralogs , and its drosophila ortholog. genomic mapping revealed that numerous pairs of ais genes and their paralogs were part of paralogons – series of paralogous regions that derive from a common ancestor – throughout the human genome, indicating that the genes were retained as duplicates after 2r-wgd. outgroup comparison analysis revealed that subfamilies in which human and fly genes shared a nervous system-related function were significantly enriched among ais subfamilies, as compared with the overall incidence of shared nervous system-related functions among all subfamilies in bilaterians. this finding statistically supports the hypothesis that ais-related signaling genes were ancestrally involved in the nervous system of urbilaterians.


CONCLUSIONS
the current results suggest that 2r-wgd played a major role in the duplication of many signaling genes, ancestrally used in nervous system development and function, that were later co-opted for new functions during evolution of the ais.
