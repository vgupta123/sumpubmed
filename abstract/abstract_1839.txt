BACKGROUND
it has long been recognized that klebsiella pneumoniae can grow anaerobically on citrate. genes responsible for citrate fermentation of k. pneumoniae were known to be located in a 13-kb gene cluster on the chromosome. by whole genome comparison of the available k. pneumoniae sequences , however, we discovered that the fermentation gene cluster was present in mgh  <dig> and  <dig>  but absent in ntuh-k <dig>  in the present study, the previously unknown genome diversity of citrate fermentation among k. pneumoniae clinical isolates was investigated.


RESULTS
using a genomic microarray containing probe sequences from multiple k. pneumoniae strains, we investigated genetic diversity among k. pneumoniae clinical isolates and found that a genomic region containing the citrate fermentation genes was not universally present in all strains. we confirmed by pcr analysis that the gene cluster was detectable in about half of the strains tested. to demonstrate the metabolic function of the genomic region, anaerobic growth of k. pneumoniae in artificial urine medium  was examined for ten strains with different clinical histories and genomic backgrounds, and the citrate fermentation potential was found correlated with the genomic region. pcr detection of the genomic region yielded high positive rates among a variety of clinical isolates collected from urine, blood, wound infection, and pneumonia. conserved genetic organizations in the vicinity of the citrate fermentation gene clusters among k. pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and escherichia coli suggest that the13-kb genomic region were not independently acquired.


CONCLUSIONS
not all, but nearly half of the k. pneumoniae clinical isolates carry the genes responsible for anaerobic growth on citrate. genomic variation of citrate fermentation genes in k. pneumoniae may contribute to metabolic diversity and adaptation to variable nutrient conditions in different environments.
