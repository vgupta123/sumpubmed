BACKGROUND
lantibiotics are lanthionine-containing, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides. these peptides have significant, but largely untapped, potential as preservatives and chemotherapeutic agents. type  <dig> lantibiotics are those in which lanthionine residues are introduced into the structural peptide  through the activity of separate lanthionine dehydratase  and lanthionine synthetase  enzymes. here we take advantage of the conserved nature of lanc enzymes to devise an in silico approach to identify potential lantibiotic-encoding gene clusters in genome sequenced bacteria.


RESULTS
in total  <dig> novel type  <dig> lantibiotic clusters were identified which unexpectedly were associated with species, genera and even phyla of bacteria which have not previously been associated with lantibiotic production.


CONCLUSIONS
multiple type  <dig> lantibiotic gene clusters were identified at a frequency that suggests that these antimicrobials are much more widespread than previously thought. these clusters represent a rich repository which can yield a large number of valuable novel antimicrobials and biosynthetic enzymes.
