BACKGROUND
micrornas  function in many physiological processes, and their discovery is beneficial for further studying their physiological functions. however, many of the mirnas predicted from genomic sequences have not been experimentally validated to be authentic expressed rna transcripts, thereby decreasing the reliability of mirna discovery. to overcome this problem, we examined expressed transcripts – ests and intronic sequences – to identify novel mirnas as well as their target genes.


RESULTS
to facilitate our approach, we developed our scanning method using criteria based on the features of  <dig> known human pre-mirnas to discriminate mirnas from random sequences. we identified  <dig> candidate hairpins in human ests and human reference gene intronic sequences,  <dig> of which are known pre-mirnas. the discovery pipeline performance was further assessed using  <dig> newly updated pre-mirna and randomly selected sequences. we achieved sensitivity of 85%  and overall specificity of  <dig> % using this method. because mirnas are evolutionarily conserved regulators of gene expression, it is expected that their host genes and target genes should have respective phylogenetic orthologs. our results confirmed that, in certain mammals, the host genes carrying the same mirnas are orthologs, as previously reported. moreover, this observation is also the case for some of the mirna target genes.


CONCLUSIONS
we have predicted  <dig> human pre-mirna candidates and over  <dig>  putative human target genes. using sequence information from ests and introns ensures that the predicted pre-mirna candidates are expressed and the combined expression transcription information from ests and introns makes our prediction results more decisive with regard to expressed pre-mirnas.
