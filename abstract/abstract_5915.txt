BACKGROUND
selenoprotein s  protects the functional integrity of the endoplasmic reticulum against the deleterious effects of metabolic stress. seps1/sels polymorphisms have been involved in the increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin -1β, tumor necrosis factor -α and il- <dig> in macrophages. we aimed at investigating the role of the seps <dig> variants previously associated with higher plasma levels of these cytokines and of the seps <dig> haplotypes in the susceptibility to develop immune-mediated diseases characterized by an inflammatory component.


RESULTS
six polymorphisms distributed through the seps <dig> gene  were genotyped in more than two thousand patients suffering from type  <dig> diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel diseases and  <dig> healthy controls included in the case-control study.


CONCLUSIONS
lack of association of seps <dig> polymorphisms or haplotypes precludes a major role of this gene increasing predisposition to these inflammatory diseases.
