BACKGROUND
3-guanidinopropionic acid derivatives reduce body weight in obese, diabetic mice. we have assessed whether one of these analogues, the aminoguanidine carboxylate bvt. <dig>  opens katp channels in rat insulinoma cells, by the same mechanism as leptin.


RESULTS
bvt. <dig> hyperpolarized cri-g <dig> rat insulinoma cells by activation of katp channels. in contrast, bvt. <dig> did not activate heterologously expressed pancreatic Î²-cell katp subunits directly. although bvt. <dig> stimulated phosphorylation of mapk and stat <dig>  there was no effect on enzymes downstream of pi3k. activation of katp in cri-g <dig> cells by bvt. <dig> was not dependent on mapk or pi3k activity. confocal imaging showed that bvt. <dig> induced a re-organization of cellular actin. furthermore, the activation of katp by bvt. <dig> in cri-g <dig> cells was demonstrated to be dependent on actin cytoskeletal dynamics, similar to that observed for leptin.


CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that bvt. <dig>  like leptin, activates katp channels in insulinoma cells. unlike leptin, bvt. <dig> activates katp channels in a pi3k-independent manner, but, like leptin, channel activation is dependent on actin cytoskeleton remodelling. thus, bvt. <dig> appears to act as a leptin mimetic, at least with respect to katp channel activation, and may bypass up-stream signalling components of the leptin pathway.
