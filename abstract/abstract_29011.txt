BACKGROUND
the aim of this paper was to develop a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification  method for rapid, sensitive and inexpensive detection of astrovirus.


RESULTS
the detection limit of lamp using in vitro rna transcripts was  <dig> × <dig> copies·μl- <dig>  which is as sensitive as the presently used pcr assays. however, the lamp products could be identified as different colors with the naked eye following staining with hydroxynaphthol blue dye . no cross-reactivity with other gastroenteric viruses  was observed, indicating the relatively high specificity of lamp. the rt-lamp method with hnb was used to effectively detect astrovirus in reclaimed water samples.


CONCLUSIONS
the lamp technique described in this study is a cheap, sensitive, specific and rapid method for the detection of astrovirus. the rt-lamp method can be simply applied for the specific detection of astrovirus and has the potential to be utilized in the field as a screening test.
