BACKGROUND
the bacterium salmonella enterica includes a diversity of serotypes that cause disease in humans and different animal species. some salmonella serotypes show a broad host range, some are host restricted and exclusively associated with one particular host, and some are associated with one particular host species, but able to cause disease in other host species and are thus considered "host adapted". five salmonella genome sequences, representing a broad host range serotype , two host restricted serotypes  and one host adapted serotype  were used to identify core genome genes that show evidence for recombination and positive selection.


RESULTS
overall,  <dig> orthologous genes were identified in all  <dig> salmonella genomes analyzed. use of four different methods to assess homologous recombination identified  <dig> genes that showed evidence for recombination with at least one of these methods . after exclusion of genes with evidence for recombination, site and branch specific models identified  <dig> genes as showing evidence for positive selection , including a number of genes with confirmed or likely roles in virulence and ompc, a gene encoding an outer membrane protein, which has also been found to be under positive selection in other bacteria. a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes showed evidence for positive selection in choleraesuis, typhi, typhimurium, and paratyphi branch analyses, respectively. sequencing and evolutionary analyses of four genes in an additional  <dig> isolates representing  <dig> serotypes confirmed branch specific positive selection and recombination patterns.


CONCLUSIONS
our data show that, among the four serotypes analyzed,  less than 10% of salmonella genes in the core genome show evidence for homologous recombination,  a number of salmonella genes are under positive selection, including genes that appear to contribute to virulence, and  branch specific positive selection contributes to the evolution of host restricted salmonella serotypes.
