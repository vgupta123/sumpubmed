BACKGROUND
atpap <dig> is a purple acid phosphatase that is targeted to both chloroplasts and mitochondria. over-expression  lines of atpap <dig> grew faster, produced more seeds, and contained higher leaf sucrose and glucose contents. the present study aimed to determine how high energy status affects leaf and root transcriptomes.


RESULTS
atp and adp levels in the oe lines are 30-50% and 20-50% higher than in the wild-type  plants. global transcriptome analyses indicated that transcriptional regulation does play a role in sucrose and starch metabolism, nitrogen, potassium and iron uptake, amino acids and secondary metabolites metabolism when there is an ample supply of energy. while the transcript abundance of genes encoding protein components of photosystem i , photosystem ii  and light harvesting complex i  were unaltered, changes in transcript abundance for genes encoding proteins of lhcii are significant. the gene expressions of most enzymes of the calvin cycle, glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid  cycle were unaltered, as these enzymes are known to be regulated by light/redox status or allosteric modulation by the products , but not at the level of transcription.


CONCLUSIONS
atpap <dig> overexpression resulted in a widespread reprogramming of the transcriptome in the transgenic plants, which is characterized by changes in the carbon, nitrogen, potassium, and iron metabolism. the fast-growing atpap <dig> oe lines provide an interesting tool for studying the regulation of energy system in plant.
