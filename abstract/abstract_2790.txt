BACKGROUND
accumulated evidence suggest that specific patterns of histone posttranslational modifications  and their crosstalks may determine transcriptional outcomes. however, the regulatory mechanisms of these "histone codes" in plants remain largely unknown.


RESULTS
in this study, we demonstrate for the first time that a salinity stress inducible phd  finger domain containing protein gmphd <dig> can read the "histone code" underlying the methylated h3k <dig>  gmphd <dig> interacts with other dna binding proteins, including gmgnat <dig> , gmelongin a  and gmiswi . our results suggest that gmphd <dig> can recognize specific histone methylated h3k <dig>  with preference to di-methylated h3k <dig>  here, we illustrate that the interaction between gmphd <dig> and gmgnat <dig> is regulated by the self-acetylation of gmgnat <dig>  which can also acetylate histone h <dig>  gmgnat <dig> exhibits a preference toward acetylated histone h3k <dig>  these results suggest a histone crosstalk between methylated h3k <dig> and acetylated h3k <dig>  consistent to its putative roles in gene regulation under salinity stress, we showed that gmphd <dig> can bind to the promoters of some confirmed salinity inducible genes in soybean.


CONCLUSIONS
here, we propose a model suggesting that the nuclear protein gmphd <dig> is capable of regulating the crosstalk between histone methylation and histone acetylation of different lysine residues. nevertheless, gmphd <dig> could also recruit chromatin remodeling factors and transcription factors of salt stress inducible genes to regulate their expression in response to salinity stress.
