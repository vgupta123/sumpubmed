BACKGROUND
francisella tularensis is an intracellular pathogen that causes tularemia in humans and the public health importance of this bacterium has been well documented in recent history. francisella philomiragia, a distant relative of f. tularensis, is thought to constitute an environmental lineage along with francisella novicida. nevertheless, both f. philomiragia and f. novicida have been associated with human disease, primarily in immune-compromised individuals. to understand the genetic relationships and evolutionary contexts among different lineages within the genus francisella, the genome of francisella spp. strain tx07- <dig> was sequenced and compared to the genomes of f. philomiragia strains atcc  <dig> and  <dig>  f. novicida strain u <dig>  and f. tularensis strain schu s <dig> 


RESULTS
the size of strain atcc  <dig> chromosome was  <dig> , <dig> bp and contained  <dig>  protein-coding genes. the size of strain tx07- <dig> chromosome was  <dig> , <dig> bp and contained  <dig>  protein-coding genes. pairwise blast comparisons indicated that strains tx07- <dig> and atcc  <dig> contained  <dig>  protein coding genes in common. nucmer analyses revealed that the chromosomes of strains tx07- <dig> and atcc  <dig> were mostly collinear except for a few gaps, translocations, and/or inversions. using the genome sequence data and comparative analyses with other members of the genus francisella , several strain-specific genes were identified. strains tx07- <dig> and atcc  <dig> contained an operon with six open reading frames encoding proteins related to enzymes involved in thiamine biosynthesis that was absent in f. novicida strain u <dig> and f. tularensis strain schu s <dig>  strain atcc  <dig> contained an operon putatively involved in lactose metabolism that was absent in strain tx07- <dig>  f. novicida strain u <dig>  and f. tularensis strain schu s <dig>  in contrast, strain tx07- <dig> contained an operon putatively involved in glucuronate metabolism that was absent in the genomes of strain atcc  <dig>  f. novicida strain u <dig>  and f. tularensis strain schu s <dig>  the polymorphic nature of polysaccharide biosynthesis/modification gene clusters among different francisella strains was also evident from genome analyses.


CONCLUSIONS
from genome comparisons, it appeared that genes encoding novel functions have contributed to the metabolic enrichment of the environmental lineages within the genus francisella. the inability to acquire new genes coupled with the loss of ancestral traits and the consequent reductive evolution may be a cause for, as well as an effect of, niche selection of f. tularensis. sequencing and comparison of the genomes of more isolates are required to obtain further insights into the ecology and evolution of different species within the genus francisella.
