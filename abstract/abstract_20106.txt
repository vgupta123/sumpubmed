BACKGROUND
in view of recurrent schmallenberg virus  infections all over europe between  <dig> and  <dig>  a lively scientific debate over the importance of the sylvatic transmission cycle of the virus has emerged. the study presents results of serosurvey which included wild ruminants representing species of red deer , roe deer , european bison , fallow deer , mouflon  hunted or immobilized at  <dig> different locations of poland in the autumn/winter  <dig> 


RESULTS
out of  <dig> sera,  <dig>  were considered positive for sbv antibodies. the overall sbv seroprevalence calculated using district probability weights was estimated at  <dig> % . the seroprevalences at the district level varied between  <dig> and  <dig> %  with the mean within-district prevalence of  <dig> % . significantly higher seroprevalence was observed in animals from the eastern provinces  compared to the western provinces . sbv infection impact varied significantly between different species , population type , age, body weight, percent of the district forest area, part of poland, and the densities of wild and domestic ruminants at the district and province level. using statistical multivariable logistic model, population type, age, part of poland and domestic ruminant density were identified as the main risk factors for sbv infection in wild ruminants in poland.


CONCLUSIONS
sbv seroprevalence in wild ruminants, similarly to the epizootic situation in domestic ruminants in the country, varied significantly between districts and provinces. association between sbv seropositivity, species, animal body weight and age group expressed by a higher prevalence in larger ruminants may be explained by more frequent exposure to midge-vector bites of the latter, however it might also be related to the different species susceptibility to sbv infection. the positive effect of higher domestic ruminant density on the risk of sbv infection in wildlife and lower sbv seroprevalences in the latter suggested that the sylvatic cycle of sbv transmission is an effect of the pathogen spillover from the domestic animals.
