BACKGROUND
the modular approach to analysis of genetically modified organisms  relies on the independence of the modules combined . the validity of this assumption has to be proved on the basis of specific performance criteria.


RESULTS
an experiment was conducted using, as a reference, the validated quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  module for detection of glyphosate-tolerant roundup readyÂ® gm soybean . different dna extraction modules , were used to extract dna from different food/feed matrices  containing the target of the real-time pcr module used for validation. purity and structural integrity  were used as basic criteria that a dna extraction module must satisfy in order to provide suitable template dna for quantitative real-time  pcr-based gmo analysis. when performance criteria were applied , the independence of gmo quantification from the extraction method and matrix was statistically proved, except in the case of wizard applied to biscuit. a fuzzy logic-based procedure also confirmed the relatively poor performance of the wizard/biscuit combination.


CONCLUSIONS
for rrs, this study recognises that modularity can be generally accepted, with the limitation of avoiding combining highly processed material  with a magnetic-beads system .
