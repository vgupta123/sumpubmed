BACKGROUND
the wnt signaling pathway is involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation during skeletal muscle development. secreted frizzled-related proteins , such as sfrp <dig>  function as inhibitors of wnt signaling. microrna-1/ <dig> is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle and play a critical role in myogenesis. the mirna-mrna profiles and bioinformatics study suggested that the sfrp <dig> gene was potentially regulated by mirna-1/ <dig> during porcine skeletal muscle development.

methods
to understand the function of sfrp <dig> and mirna-1/ <dig> in swine myogenesis, we first predicted the targets of mirna-1/ <dig> with the targetscan and pictar programs, and analyzed the molecular characterization of the porcine sfrp <dig> gene. we performed a temporal-spatial expression analysis of sfrp <dig> mrna and mirna- <dig> in tongcheng pigs  by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and conducted the co-expression analyses of sfrp <dig> and mirna-1/ <dig>  subsequently, the interaction between sfrp <dig> and mirna-1/ <dig> was validated via dual luciferase and western blot assays.


RESULTS
the bioinformatics analysis predicted sfrp <dig> to be a target of mirna-1/ <dig>  the expression level of the sfrp <dig> was highly varied across numerous pig tissues and it was down-regulated during porcine skeletal muscle development. the expression level of the sfrp <dig> was significantly higher in the embryonic skeletal compared with postnatal skeletal muscle, whereas mir- <dig> showed the inverse pattern of expression. a significant negative correlation was observed between the expression of mir-1/ <dig> and sfrp <dig> during porcine skeletal muscle development . dual luciferase assay and western-blot results demonstrated that sfrp <dig> was a target of mir-1/ <dig> in porcine iliac endothelial cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the sfrp <dig> gene is regulated by mir-1/ <dig> and potentially affects skeletal muscle development. these findings increase understanding of the biological functions and the regulation of the sfrp <dig> gene in mammals.
