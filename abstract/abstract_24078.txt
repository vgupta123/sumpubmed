BACKGROUND
because arctic plant communities are highly vulnerable to climate change, shifts in their composition require rapid, accurate identifications, often for specimens that lack diagnostic floral characters. the present study examines the role that dna barcoding can play in aiding floristic evaluations in the arctic by testing the effectiveness of the core plant barcode regions  and a supplemental ribosomal dna  marker for a well-studied flora near churchill, manitoba.


RESULTS
this investigation examined  <dig> specimens representing  <dig> of the  <dig> species of vascular plants known from churchill. sequencing success was high for rbcl: 95% for fresh specimens and 85% for herbarium samples . its <dig> worked equally well for the fresh and herbarium material . however, sequencing success was lower for matk, despite two rounds of pcr amplification, which reflected less effective primer binding and sensitivity to the dna degradation . a species was considered as taxonomically resolved if its members showed at least one diagnostic difference from any other taxon in the study and formed a monophyletic clade. the highest species resolution  was obtained by combining information from all three genes. the joint sequence information for rbcl and matk distinguished 54% of  <dig> species, while rbcl and its <dig> distinguished 63% of  <dig> species. discrimination of species within salix, which constituted 8% of the flora, was particularly problematic. despite incomplete resolution, the barcode results revealed  <dig> misidentified herbarium specimens, and enabled the identification of field specimens which were otherwise too immature to identify. although seven cases of its <dig> paralogy were noted in the families cyperaceae, juncaceae and juncaginaceae, this intergenic spacer played an important role in resolving congeneric plant species at churchill.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provided fast and cost-effective solution to create a comprehensive, effective dna barcode reference library for a local flora.
