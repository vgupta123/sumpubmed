BACKGROUND
foot-and-mouth disease  is a highly contagious disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals and causes significant economic losses to husbandry worldwide. the variable domain of heavy-chain antibodies  are single-domain antigen-binding fragments derived from camelid heavy-chain antibodies.


RESULTS
in this work, two sdabs against fmd virus  serotype o were selected from a camelid phage display immune library and expressed in escherichia coli. the serotype specificity and affinity of the sdabs were identified through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance assay. moreover, the sdabs were conjugated with quantum dots to constitute probes for imaging fmd virions. results demonstrated that the two sdabs were specific for serotype o and shared no cross-reactivity with serotypes a and asia  <dig>  the equilibrium dissociation constant  values of the two sdabs ranged from  <dig>  nm to  <dig>  nm, which indicated high affinity to fmdv antigens. co-localization with the sdab-af <dig> and sdab-qd probes indicated the same location of fmdv virions in baby hamster kidney- <dig>  cells.


CONCLUSIONS
sdab-qd probes are powerful tools to detect and image fmdv in bhk- <dig> cells.
