BACKGROUND
enterohepatic bacterial infections have the potential to affect multiple physiological processes of the body. fibroblast growth factor 15/ <dig>  is a hormone that functions as a central regulator of glucose, lipid and bile acid metabolism. fgf15/ <dig> is produced in the intestine and exert its actions on the liver by signaling through the fgfr4-βklotho receptor complex. here, we examined the in vivo effects of enterohepatic bacterial infection over the fgf <dig> endocrine axis.


RESULTS
infection triggered significant reductions in the intestinal expression of fgf <dig> and its hepatic receptor components ). infection also resulted in alterations of the expression pattern of genes involved in hepatobiliary function, marked reduction in gallbladder bile volumes and accumulation of hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides. the decrease in ileal fgf <dig> expression was associated with liver bacterial colonization and hepatobiliary pathophysiology rather than with direct intestinal bacterial pathogenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
bacterial pathogens of the enterohepatic system can disturb the homeostasis of the fgf15/19-fgfr <dig> endocrine axis. these results open up a possible link between fgf15/19-fgfr <dig> disruptions and the metabolic and nutritional disorders observed in infectious diseases.
