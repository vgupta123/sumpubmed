BACKGROUND
we have previously identified associations between major histocompatibility complex  class i and resistance towards bacterial and viral pathogens in atlantic salmon. to evaluate if only mhc or also closely linked genes contributed to the observed resistance we ventured into sequencing of the duplicated mhc class i regions of atlantic salmon.


RESULTS
nine bacs covering more than  <dig> kb of the two duplicated mhc class i regions of atlantic salmon were sequenced and the gene organizations characterized. both regions contained the proteasome components psmb <dig>  psmb <dig>  psmb9-like and psmb <dig> in addition to the transporter for antigen processing tap <dig>  as well as genes for kifc <dig>  zbtb <dig>  daxx, tapbp, brd <dig>  col11a <dig>  rxrb and slc39a <dig>  the ia region contained the recently reported mhc class i sasa-ula locus residing approximately  <dig> kb upstream of the major sasa-uba locus. the duplicated class ib region contained an mhc class i locus resembling the rainbow trout uca locus, but although transcribed it was a pseudogene. no other mhc class i-like genes were detected in the two duplicated regions. two allelic bacs spanning the uba locus had  <dig> % identity over  <dig> kb, while the ia region showed  <dig> % identity over  <dig> kb to the ib region. the atlantic salmon ib region had an insert of  <dig> kb in comparison to the ia region containing three chitin synthase genes.


CONCLUSIONS
we have characterized the gene organization of more than  <dig> kb of the two duplicated mhc class i regions in atlantic salmon. although atlantic salmon and rainbow trout are closely related, the gene organization of their ib region has undergone extensive gene rearrangements. the atlantic salmon has only one class i uca pseudogene in the ib region while trout contains the four mhc uca, uda, uea and ufa class i loci. the large differences in gene content and most likely function of the salmon and trout class ib region clearly argues that sequencing of salmon will not necessarily provide information relevant for trout and vice versa.
