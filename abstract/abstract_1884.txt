BACKGROUND
meganucleases are important tools for genome engineering, providing an efficient way to generate dna double-strand breaks at specific loci of interest. numerous experimental efforts, ranging from in vivo selection to in silico modeling, have been made to re-engineer meganucleases to target relevant dna sequences.


RESULTS
here we present a novel in silico method for designing custom meganucleases that is based on the use of a machine learning approach. we compared it with existing in silico physical models and high-throughput experimental screening. the machine learning model was used to successfully predict active meganucleases for  <dig> new dna targets.


CONCLUSIONS
this new method shows competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art in silico physical models, with up to a fourfold increase in terms of the design success rate. compared to experimental high-throughput screening methods, it reduces the number of screening experiments needed by a factor of more than  <dig> without affecting final performance.
