BACKGROUND
the completion and reporting of baculovirus genomes is extremely important as it advances our understanding of gene function and evolution. due to the large number of viral genomes now sequenced it is very important that authors present significantly detailed analyses to advance the understanding of the viral genomes. however, there is no report of the antheraea pernyi nucleopolyhedrovirus  genome.


RESULTS
the genome of anpenpv, which infects chinese tussah silkworm , was sequenced and analyzed. the genome was  <dig>  bp in size. the g+c content of the genome,  <dig> %, was higher than that of most of the sequenced baculoviruses.  <dig> open reading frames  that putatively encode proteins of  <dig> or more amino acid residues with minimal overlap were determined. of the  <dig> orfs,  <dig> appeared to be homologous to other baculovirus genes, and  <dig> were unique to anpenpv. furthermore, there are still  <dig> and  <dig> conserved genes present in all baculoviruses and all lepidopteran baculoviruses respectively. in addition, the total number of genes common to all lepidopteran npvs is sill  <dig>  however the  <dig> genes are somewhat different from the  <dig> genes identified before because of some new sequenced npvs. only  <dig> genes were found exclusively in all lepidopteran npvs and  <dig> genes were found exclusively in all group i npvs. anpenpv encodes v-trex, which was observed only in cfmnpv and cfdefnpv in group i npvs. this gene potentially originated by horizontal gene transfer from an ancestral host. in addition, anpenpv encodes two conotoxin-like gene homologues , ctl <dig> and ctl <dig>  which were observed only in hycunpv, opmnpv and ldmnpv. unlike other baculoviruses, only  <dig> typical homologous regions  were identified containing 2~ <dig> repeats of a  <dig> bp-long palindromic core. however,  <dig> perfect or imperfect direct repeats  with a high degree of at content were found within the intergenic spacer regions that may function as non-hr, ori-like regions found in grlegv, cpgv and adorgv.  <dig> drs were also found in intragenic spacer regions of anpenpv.


CONCLUSIONS
anpenpv belongs to group i npvs and is most similar to hycunpv, epponpv, opmnpv and cfmnpv based on gene content, genome arrangement, and amino acid identity. in addition, analysis of genes that flank hrs supported the argument that these regions are involved in the transfer of sequences between the virus and host.
