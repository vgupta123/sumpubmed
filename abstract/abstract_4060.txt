BACKGROUND
retrotransposition of mrna transcripts gives occasionally rise to functional retrogenes. through acquiring tempero-spatial expression patterns distinct from their parental genes and/or functional mutations in their coding sequences, such retrogenes may in principle reshape signalling networks.


RESULTS
here we present evidence for such a scenario, involving retrogenes of rap <dig> belonging to the ras family of small gtpases. we identified two murine and one human-specific retrogene of rap1a and rap1b, which encode proteins that differ by only a few amino acids from their parental rap <dig> proteins. markedly, human hrap1b-retro and mouse mrap1a-retro <dig> acquired mutations in the 12th and 59th amino acids, respectively, corresponding to residues mutated in constitutively active oncogenic ras proteins. statistical and structural analyses support a functional evolution scenario, where rap <dig> isoforms of retrogenic origin are functionally distinct from their parental proteins. indeed, all retrogene-encoded gtpases have an increased gtp/gdp binding ratio in vivo, indicating that their conformations resemble that of active gtp-bound rap <dig>  we furthermore demonstrate that these three rap <dig> isoforms exhibit distinct affinities for the ras-binding domain of ralgds. finally, when tested for their capacity to induce key cellular processes like integrin-mediated cell adhesion or cell spreading, marked differences are seen.


CONCLUSIONS
together, these data lend strong support for an evolution scenario, where retrotransposition and subsequent mutation events generated species-specific rap <dig> isoforms with differential signaling potential. expression of the constitutively active human rap1b-retro in cells like those derived from ramos burkitt's lymphoma and bone marrow from a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome  warrants further investigation into its role in disease development.
