BACKGROUND
non-heading chinese cabbage , belonging to brassica, is an important leaf vegetable in asia. although genetic analyses have been performed through conventional selection and breeding efforts, the domestication history of nhcc and the genetics underlying its morphological diversity remain unclear. thus, the reliable molecular markers representative of the whole genome are required for molecular-assisted selection in nhcc.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  simple sequence repeats  were detected in nhcc, containing repeat types from mononucleotide to nonanucleotide. the average density was  <dig>  ssrs/mb. in gene regions,  <dig>  ssrs were identified in  <dig>  genes. a total of  <dig>  primer pairs were designed, and  <dig> were randomly selected for validation. among these,  <dig>  were polymorphic in  <dig> cruciferae. the number of polymorphic bands ranged from two to five, with an average of  <dig>  for each primer. the average values of the polymorphism information content, observed heterozygosity, hardy-weinberg equilibrium, and shannon’s information index were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. four clusters were classified according to the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average cluster analysis of  <dig> genotypes. in addition, a total of  <dig> , <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  were identified in the nhcc through a comparison with the genome of chinese cabbage, and the average snp density in the whole genome was  <dig> /kb. the number of snps ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the  <dig> accessions, and the average heterozygous snps ratio was ~ <dig> %. all analyses showed these markers were high quality and reliable. therefore, they could be used in the construction of a linkage map and for genetic diversity studies for nhcc in future.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first systematic and comprehensive analysis and identification of ssrs in nhcc and  <dig> species. the development of a large number of snp and ssr markers was successfully achieved for nhcc. these novel markers are valuable for constructing genetic linkage maps, comparative genome analysis, quantitative trait locus  mapping, genome-wide association studies, and marker-assisted selection in nhcc breeding system research.
