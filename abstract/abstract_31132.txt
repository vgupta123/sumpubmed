BACKGROUND
the cytochrome p450s are monooxygenases that insert oxygen functionalities into a wide variety of organic substrates with high selectivity. there is interest in developing efficient catalysts based on the “peroxide shunt” pathway in the cytochrome p450s, which uses h2o <dig> in place of o2/nadph as the oxygenation agent. we report on our initial studies using cytochrome c peroxidase  as a platform to develop specific “peroxygenation” catalysts.


RESULTS
the peroxygenase activity of ccp was investigated using 1-methoxynaphthalene as substrate. 1-methoxynaphthalene hydroxylation was monitored using russig’s blue formation at standard reaction conditions of  <dig>  mm 1-methoxynaphthalene,  <dig>  mm h2o <dig>  ph  <dig> , 25°c. wild-type ccp catalyzes the hydroxylation of 1-methoxynaphthalene with a turnover number of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min- <dig>  three apolar distal heme pocket mutants of ccp were designed to enhance binding of 1-methoxynaphthalene near the heme, constructed, and tested for hydroxylation activity. the highest activity was observed for ccp, a triple mutant with arg <dig>  trp <dig>  and his <dig> simultaneously mutated to alanine residues. the turnover number of ccp is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min- <dig>  34-fold greater than wild-type ccp and comparable to the naphthalene hydroxylation activity of rat liver microsomal cytochrome p <dig>  while wild-type ccp is very stable to oxidative degradation by excess hydrogen peroxide, ccp is inactivated within four cycles of the peroxygenase reaction.


CONCLUSIONS
protein engineering of ccp can increase the rate of peroxygenation of apolar substrates but the initial constructs are more susceptible to oxidative degradation than wild-type enzyme. further developments will require constructs with increased rates and selectivity while maintaining the stability of wild-type ccp toward oxidative degradation by hydrogen peroxide.
