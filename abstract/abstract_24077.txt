BACKGROUND
shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig> exhibits extracellular electron transfer  activity that is influenced by various cellular components, including outer-membrane cytochromes, cell-surface polysaccharides , and regulatory proteins. here, a random transposon-insertion mutant library of s. oneidensis mr- <dig> was screened after extended cultivation in electrochemical cells  with a working electrode poised at + <dig>  v  to isolate mutants that adapted to electrode-respiring conditions and identify as-yet-unknown eet-related factors.


RESULTS
several mutants isolated from the enrichment culture exhibited rough morphology and extraordinarily large colonies on agar plates compared to wild-type mr- <dig>  one of the isolated mutants, designated strain ec- <dig>  produced 90% higher electric current than wild-type mr- <dig> in ecs and was found to have a transposon inserted in the so_ <dig>  gene, which encodes a dna-binding response regulator of the bara/uvry two-component regulatory system. however, an in-frame deletion mutant of so_ <dig>  did not exhibit a similar level of current generation as that of ec- <dig>  suggesting that the enhanced current-generating capability of ec- <dig> was not simply due to the disruption of so_ <dig>  in both ec- <dig> and ∆so_ <dig>  the transcription of genes related to cps synthesis was decreased compared to wild-type mr- <dig>  suggesting that cps negatively affects current generation. in addition, transcriptome analyses revealed that a number of genes, including those involved in biofilm formation, were differentially expressed in ec- <dig> compared to those in ∆so_ <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the present results indicate that the altered expression of the genes related to cps biosynthesis and biofilm formation is associated with the distinct morphotype and high current-generating capability of strain ec- <dig>  suggesting an important role of these genes in determining the eet activity of s. oneidensis.
