BACKGROUND
valvulogenesis and septation in the developing heart depend on the formation and remodeling of endocardial cushions in the atrioventricular canal  and outflow tract . these cushions are invaded by a subpopulation of endocardial cells that undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition in response to paracrine and autocrine transforming growth factor β  signals. we previously demonstrated that the rna binding protein muscleblind-like  <dig>  is expressed specifically in the cushion endocardium, and knockdown of mbnl <dig> in stage  <dig> embryonic chicken avc explants enhances tgfβ-dependent endocardial cell invasion.


RESULTS
in this study, we demonstrate that the effect of mbnl <dig> knockdown on invasion remains dependent on tgfβ <dig> after it is no longer required to induce basal levels of invasion. tgfβ <dig>  but not tgfβ <dig>  levels are elevated in medium conditioned by mbnl1-depleted avc explants. tgfβ <dig> is elevated even when the myocardium is removed, indicating that mbnl <dig> modulates autocrine tgfβ <dig> production in the endocardium. more tgfβ3-positive cells are observed in the endocardial monolayer following mbnl <dig> knockdown. addition of exogenous tgfβ <dig> to avc explants recapitulates the effects of mbnl <dig> knockdown. time course experiments demonstrate that knockdown of mbnl <dig> induces precocious tgfβ <dig> secretion, and early exposure to excess tgfβ <dig> induces precocious invasion. mbnl <dig> expression precedes tgfβ <dig> in the avc endocardium, consistent with a role in preventing precocious autocrine tgfβ <dig> signaling. the stimulatory effects of mbnl <dig> knockdown on invasion are lost in stage  <dig> avc explants. knockdown of mbnl <dig> in oft explants similarly enhances cell invasion, but not activation. tgfβ is necessary and sufficient to mediate this effect.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these data support a model in which mbnl <dig> negatively regulates cell invasion in the endocardial cushions by restricting the magnitude and timing of endocardial-derived tgfβ <dig> production.
