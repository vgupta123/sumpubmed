BACKGROUND
the key steps in germ cell survival during ovarian development are the entry into meiosis of oogonies and the formation of primordial follicles, which then determine the reproductive lifespan of the ovary. in sheep, these steps occur during fetal life, between  <dig> and  <dig> days of gestation, respectively. the aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed ovarian genes during prophase i meiosis and early folliculogenesis in sheep.


RESULTS
in order to elucidate the molecular events associated with early ovarian differentiation, we generated two ovary stage-specific subtracted cdna libraries using ssh. large-scale sequencing of these ssh libraries identified  <dig>  ests representing  <dig>  contigs. clustering and assembly of these ests resulted in a total of  <dig>  unique sequences depicted in  <dig>  singleton  and  <dig> contigs  ests . blastx evaluation indicated that 99% of the ests were homologous to various known genes/proteins in a broad range of organisms, especially ovine, bovine and human species. the remaining 1% which exhibited any homology to known gene sequences was considered as novel. detailed study of the expression patterns of some of these genes using rt-pcr revealed new promising candidates for ovary differentiation genes in sheep.


CONCLUSIONS
we showed that the ssh approach was relevant to determining new mammalian genes which might be involved in oogenesis and early follicle development, and enabled the discovery of new potential oocyte and granulosa cell markers for future studies. these genes may have significant implications regarding our understanding of ovarian function in molecular terms, and for the development of innovative strategies to both promote and control fertility.
