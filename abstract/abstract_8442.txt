BACKGROUND
the potential of genetic testing to rapidly diagnose drug resistance has lead to the development of new diagnostic assays. however, prior to implementation in a given setting, the association of specific mutations with specific drug resistance phenotypes should be evaluated. the purpose of this study was to evaluate molecular markers in predicting drug resistance in the central region of cameroon.


RESULTS
from april  <dig> and march  <dig>   <dig> smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients were enrolled and all positive cultures were tested for drug susceptibility. a total of  <dig> drug resistant and  <dig> drug sensitive mycobacterium tuberculosis complex clinical isolates were screened for genetic mutations in katg, inha, ahpc, rpob, rpsl, rrs, gidb and embcab loci using dna sequencing. of the  <dig> isoniazid resistant  isolates , 73%  carried the katg <dig> and/or the - <dig> inha promoter mutations. of the  <dig> high level inhr,  <dig>  harbored katg <dig> mutation,  <dig> a point mutation  in the inha promoter and  <dig> were  wild types. thus, for inhr high level detection, katg <dig> mutation had a specificity and a sensitivity of 100% and  <dig> % respectively. of the  <dig> low level inhr,  <dig>  had a -15c → t mutation in the inha promoter region, and  <dig>  a -32g → a mutation in the ahpc promoter region. all of the  <dig> rifampicin resistant  isolates carried mutations in the rpob gene , his526asp , and asp516val ). of the  <dig> streptomycin resistant  isolates,  <dig> carried mutations at the rpsl and the gidb genes.  <dig> of the  <dig> ethambutol resistant  isolates displayed a mutation in embb gene.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provided the first molecular investigation assessing the correlation of phenotypic to genotypic characteristics on mtb isolates from the central region of cameroon using dna sequencing. mutations on rpob, katg <dig> and - <dig> point mutations in inha promoter loci could be used as markers for rif and inh -resistance detection respectively.
