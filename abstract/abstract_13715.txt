BACKGROUND
the accurate detection of differentially expressed  genes has become a central task in microarray analysis. unfortunately, the noise level and experimental variability of microarrays can be limiting. while a number of existing methods partially overcome these limitations by incorporating biological knowledge in the form of gene groups, these methods sacrifice gene-level resolution. this loss of precision can be inappropriate, especially if the desired output is a ranked list of individual genes. to address this shortcoming, we developed m-bison , a formal probabilistic model that integrates background biological knowledge with microarray data to predict individual de genes.


RESULTS
m-bison improves signal detection on a range of simulated data, particularly when using very noisy microarray data. we also applied the method to the task of predicting heat shock-related differentially expressed genes in s. cerevisiae, using an hsf <dig> mutant microarray dataset and conserved yeast dna sequence motifs. our results demonstrate that m-bison improves the analysis quality and makes predictions that are easy to interpret in concert with incorporated knowledge. specifically, m-bison increases the auc of de gene prediction from . <dig> to . <dig> when compared to a method using only microarray data, and m-bison outperforms a related method, generank. furthermore, by analyzing m-bison predictions in the context of the background knowledge, we identified yhr124w as a potentially novel player in the yeast heat shock response.


CONCLUSIONS
this work provides a solid foundation for the principled integration of imperfect biological knowledge with gene expression data and other high-throughput data sources.
