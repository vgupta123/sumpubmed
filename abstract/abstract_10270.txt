BACKGROUND
most fungi, including entomopathogenic fungi, have two different conidiation patterns, normal and microcycle conidiation, under different culture conditions, eg, in media containing different nutrients. however, the mechanisms underlying the conidiation pattern shift are poorly understood.


RESULTS
in this study, metarhizium acridum undergoing microcycle conidiation on sucrose yeast extract agar  medium shifted to normal conidiation when the medium was supplemented with sucrose, nitrate, or phosphate. by linking changes in nutrients with the conidiation pattern shift and transcriptional changes, we obtained conidiation pattern shift libraries by solexa/illumina deep-sequencing technology. a comparative analysis demonstrated that the expression of  <dig> genes was up-regulated during the shift to normal conidiation, while the expression of  <dig> genes was up-regulated at the microcycle conidiation stage. a comparison of subtractive libraries revealed that  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were related to sucrose-induced, nitrate-induced, and phosphate-induced conidiation pattern shifts, respectively. the expression of  <dig> genes whose expression was specific to microcycle conidiation was further analyzed by the gene expression profiling via multigene concatemers method using mrna isolated from m. acridum grown on sya and the four normal conidiation media. the expression of  <dig> genes was confirmed to be up-regulated on standard sya medium. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> encode hypothetical proteins or proteins of unknown function, and only  <dig> genes encode proteins with putative functions. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> are related to cell growth,  <dig> are related to cell proliferation, three are related to the cell cycle, three are related to cell differentiation, two are related to cell wall synthesis, two are related to cell division, and seven have other functions. these results indicate that the conidiation pattern shift in m. acridum mainly results from changes in cell growth and proliferation.


CONCLUSIONS
the results indicate that m. acridum shifts conidiation pattern from microcycle conidiation to normal conidiation when there is increased sucrose, nitrate, or phosphate in the medium during microcycle conidiation. the regulation of conidiation patterning is a complex process involving the cell cycle and metabolism of m. acridum. this study provides essential information about the molecular mechanism of the induction of the conidiation pattern shift by single nutrients.
