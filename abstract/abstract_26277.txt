BACKGROUND
handling genotype data typed at hundreds of thousands of loci is very time-consuming and it is no exception for population structure inference. therefore, we propose to apply pca to the genotype data of a population, select the significant principal components using the tracy-widom distribution, and assign the individuals to one or more subpopulations using generic clustering algorithms.


RESULTS
we investigated k-means, soft k-means and spectral clustering and made comparison to structure, a model-based algorithm specifically designed for population structure inference. moreover, we investigated methods for predicting the number of subpopulations in a population. the results on four simulated datasets and two real datasets indicate that our approach performs comparably well to structure. for the simulated datasets, structure and soft k-means with bic produced identical predictions on the number of subpopulations. we also showed that, for real dataset, bic is a better index than likelihood in predicting the number of subpopulations.


CONCLUSIONS
our approach has the advantage of being fast and scalable, while structure is very time-consuming because of the nature of mcmc in parameter estimation. therefore, we suggest choosing the proper algorithm based on the application of population structure inference.
