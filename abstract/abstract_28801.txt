BACKGROUND
the evolutionary analysis of molecular sequence variation is a statistical enterprise. this is reflected in the increased use of probabilistic models for phylogenetic inference, multiple sequence alignment, and molecular population genetics. here we present beast: a fast, flexible software architecture for bayesian analysis of molecular sequences related by an evolutionary tree. a large number of popular stochastic models of sequence evolution are provided and tree-based models suitable for both within- and between-species sequence data are implemented.


RESULTS
beast version  <dig> . <dig> consists of  <dig> lines of java source code,  <dig> classes and  <dig> packages. it provides models for dna and protein sequence evolution, highly parametric coalescent analysis, relaxed clock phylogenetics, non-contemporaneous sequence data, statistical alignment and a wide range of options for prior distributions. beast source code is object-oriented, modular in design and freely available at  under the gnu lgpl license.


CONCLUSIONS
beast is a powerful and flexible evolutionary analysis package for molecular sequence variation. it also provides a resource for the further development of new models and statistical methods of evolutionary analysis.
