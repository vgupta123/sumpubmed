BACKGROUND
we have recently demonstrated that modulation of the gap junction protein, connexin <dig>  can affect the response of osteoblasts to fibroblast growth factor  <dig> in a protein kinase c-delta-dependent manner. others have shown that the c-terminal tail of connexin <dig> serves as a docking platform for signaling complexes. it is unknown whether protein kinase c-delta can physically interact with connexin <dig> 


RESULTS
in the present study, we investigate by immunofluorescent co-detection and biochemical examination the interaction between cx <dig> and protein kinase c-delta. we establish that protein kinase c-delta physically interacts with connexin <dig> during fibroblast growth factor  <dig> signaling, and that protein kinase c delta preferentially co-precipitates phosphorylated connexin <dig>  further, we show by pull down assay that protein kinase c-delta associates with the c-terminal tail of connexin <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
connexin <dig> can serve as a direct docking platform for the recruitment of protein kinase c-delta in order to affect fibroblast growth factor  <dig> signaling in osteoblasts. these data expand the list of signal molecules that assemble on the connexin <dig> c-terminal tail and provide a critical context to understand how gap junctions modify signal transduction cascades in order to impact cell function.
