BACKGROUND
cassava  can produce cyanide, a toxic compound, without self-injury. that ability was called the cyanogenic potential . this project aimed to identify quantitative trait loci  associated with the cn in an outbred population derived from 'hanatee' Ã— 'huay bong 60', two contrasting cultivars. cn was evaluated in  <dig> and in  <dig> at rayong province, and in  <dig> at lop buri province, thailand. cn was measured using a picrate paper kit. qtl analysis affecting cn was performed with  <dig> ssr markers.


RESULTS
the phenotypic values showed continuous variation with transgressive segregation events with more  and less cn  than either parent . the linkage map consisted of  <dig> ssr markers, on  <dig> linkage groups with a map that encompassed  <dig>  cm. the average marker interval was  <dig>  cm. five qtl underlying cn were detected. cn08r1from  <dig> at rayong, cn09r1and cn09r <dig> from  <dig> at rayong, and cn09l <dig> and cn09l <dig> from  <dig> at lop buri were mapped on linkage group  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. among all the identified qtl, cn09r <dig> was the most significantly associated with the cn trait with lod score  <dig>  and explained the greatest percentage of phenotypic variation  of 26%.


CONCLUSIONS
five new qtl affecting cn were successfully identified from  <dig> linkage groups. discovery of these qtl can provide useful markers to assist in cassava breeding and studying genes affecting the trait.
