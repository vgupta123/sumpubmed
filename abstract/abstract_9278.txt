BACKGROUND
atg has been employed to deplete t cells in several immune-mediated conditions. however, whether atg administration affects naïve and memory t cell differently is largely unknown.

the context and purpose of the study
in this study, we assessed how murine atg therapy affected t cell subsets in nod mice, based on their regulatory and naïve or memory phenotype, as well as its influence on antigen-specific immune responses.


RESULTS
peripheral blood cd4+ and cd8+ t cells post-atg therapy declined to their lowest levels at day  <dig>  while cd4+ t cells returned to normal levels more rapidly than cd8+ t cells. atg therapy failed to eliminate antigen-primed t cells. cd4+ t cell responses post-atg therapy skewed to t helper type  <dig>  and possibly il-10-producing t regulatory type  <dig>  cells. intriguingly, foxp3+ regulatory t cells  were less sensitive to atg depletion and remained at higher levels following in vivo recovery compared to controls. of note, the frequency of foxp3+ tregs with memory t cell phenotype was significantly increased in atg-treated animals.


CONCLUSIONS
atg therapy may modulate antigen-specific immune responses through inducing memory-like regulatory t cells as well as other protective t cells such as th <dig> and il-10-producing tr <dig> cells.
