BACKGROUND
the flaviviridae virus family includes major human and animal pathogens. the rna dependent rna polymerase  plays a central role in the replication process, and thus is a validated target for antiviral drugs. despite the increasing structural and enzymatic characterization of viral rdrps, detailed molecular replication mechanisms remain unclear. the hepatitis c virus  is a major human pathogen difficult to study in cultured cells. the bovine viral diarrhea virus  is often used as a surrogate model to screen antiviral drugs against hcv. the structure of bvdv rdrp has been recently published. it presents several differences relative to hcv rdrp. these differences raise questions about the relevance of bvdv as a surrogate model, and cast novel interest on the "gb" virus c . indeed, gbv-c is genetically closer to hcv than bvdv, and can lead to productive infection of cultured cells. there is no structural data for the gbv-c rdrp yet.


RESULTS
we show in this study that the gbv-c rdrp is closest to the hcv rdrp. we report a 3d model of the gbv-c rdrp, developed using sequence-to-structure threading and comparative modeling based on the atomic coordinates of the hcv rdrp structure. analysis of the predicted structural features in the phylogenetic context of the rna polymerase family allows rationalizing most of the experimental data available. both available structures and our model are explored to examine the catalytic cleft, allosteric and substrate binding sites.


CONCLUSIONS
computational methods were used to infer evolutionary relationships and to predict the structure of a viral rna polymerase. docking a gtp molecule into the structure allows defining a gtp binding pocket in the gbv-c rdrp, such as that of bvdv. the resulting model suggests a new proposition for the mechanism of rna synthesis, and may prove useful to design new experiments to implement our knowledge on the initiation mechanism of rna polymerases.
