BACKGROUND
the genome of serotype m <dig> group a streptococcus  strain mgas <dig> contains a novel genetic element named region of difference  <dig>  that encodes seven putative secreted extracellular proteins. rd <dig> is present in all serotype m <dig> strains and strains of several other gas serotypes associated with female urogenital infections. we show here that the gas rd <dig> element is present in strain mgas <dig> both as an integrative chromosomal form and a circular extrachromosomal element. rd2-like regions were identified in publicly available genome sequences of strains representing three of the five major group b streptococcal serotypes causing human disease. ten rd2-encoded proteins have significant similarity to proteins involved in conjugative transfer of streptococcus thermophilus integrative chromosomal elements .


RESULTS
we transferred rd <dig> from gas strain mgas <dig>  to serotype m <dig> and m <dig> gas strains by filter mating. the copy number of the rd <dig> element was rapidly and significantly increased following treatment of strain mgas <dig> with mitomycin c, a dna damaging agent. using a pcr-based method, we also identified rd2-like regions in multiple group c and g strains of streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp.equisimilis cultured from invasive human infections.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the data indicate that the rd <dig> element has disseminated by lateral gene transfer to genetically diverse strains of human-pathogenic streptococci.
