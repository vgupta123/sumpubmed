BACKGROUND
in response to environmental iron concentrations, many bacteria coordinately regulate transcription of genes involved in iron acquisition via the ferric uptake regulation  system. the genome of nitrosomonas europaea, an ammonia-oxidizing bacterium, carries three genes  encoding proteins belonging to fur family.


RESULTS
of the three n. europaea fur homologs, only the fur homolog encoded by gene ne <dig> complemented the escherichia coli h <dig> fur mutant. a n. europaea fur:kanp mutant strain was created by insertion of kanamycin-resistance cassette in the promoter region of ne <dig> fur homolog. the total cellular iron contents of the fur:kanp mutant strain increased by  <dig> -fold compared to wild type when grown in fe-replete media. relative to the wild type, the fur:kanp mutant exhibited increased sensitivity to iron at or above  <dig> Î¼m concentrations. unlike the wild type, the fur:kanp mutant was capable of utilizing iron-bound ferrioxamine without any lag phase and showed over expression of several outer membrane tonb-dependent receptor proteins irrespective of fe availability.


CONCLUSIONS
our studies have clearly indicated a role in fe regulation by the fur protein encoded by n. europaea ne <dig> gene. additional studies are required to fully delineate role of this fur homolog.
