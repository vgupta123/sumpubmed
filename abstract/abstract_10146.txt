BACKGROUND
several resistance traits, including the i <dig> resistance against tomato fusarium wilt, were mapped to the long arm of chromosome  <dig> of solanum. however, the structure and evolution of this locus remain poorly understood.


RESULTS
comparative analysis showed that the structure and evolutionary patterns of the i <dig> locus vary considerably between potato and tomato. the i <dig> homologues from different solanaceae species usually do not have orthologous relationship, due to duplication, deletion and frequent sequence exchanges. at least  <dig> sequence exchanges were detected among  <dig> tomato i <dig> homologues, but sequence exchanges between i <dig> homologues in potato is less frequent. previous study showed that i <dig> homologues in potato were targeted by mir <dig>  however, our data showed that i <dig> homologues in tomato were targeted by mir <dig> rather than mir <dig>  furthermore, mir <dig> triggers phasirnas from i <dig> homologues in tomato. sequence analysis showed that mir <dig> was originated after the divergence of solanaceae. we hypothesized that mir <dig> and mir <dig> might have facilitated the expansion of the i <dig> family in solanaceae species, since they can minimize their potential toxic effects by down-regulating their expression.


CONCLUSIONS
the i <dig> locus represents a most divergent resistance gene cluster in solanum. its high divergence was partly due to frequent sequence exchanges between homologues. we propose that the successful expansion of i <dig> homologues in solanum was at least partially attributed to mirna mediated regulation.
