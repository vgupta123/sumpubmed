BACKGROUND
the p <dig> protein family coordinates stress responses of cells and organisms. alternative promoter usage and/or splicing of p <dig> mrna gives rise to at least nine mammalian p <dig> proteins with distinct n- and c-termini which are differentially expressed in normal and malignant cells. the human n-terminal p <dig> variants contain either the full-length , or a truncated  or no transactivation domain  altogether. the functional consequences of coexpression of the different p <dig> isoforms are poorly defined. here we investigated functional aspects of the zebrafish Δnp <dig> ortholog in the context of flp <dig> and the zebrafish Δ133p <dig> ortholog  coexpressed in the developing embryo.


RESULTS
we cloned the zebrafish Δnp <dig> isoform and determined that ionizing radiation increased expression of steady-state Δnp <dig> and Δ113p <dig> mrna levels in zebrafish embryos. ectopic Δnp <dig> expression by mrna injection caused hypoplasia and malformation of the head, eyes and somites, yet partially counteracted lethal effects caused by concomitant expression of flp <dig>  flp <dig> expression was required for developmental aberrations caused by Δnp <dig> and for Δnp53-dependent expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a . knockdown of p <dig> expression markedly reduced the severity of developmental malformations associated with Δnp <dig> overexpression. by contrast, forced Δ113p <dig> expression had little effect on Δnp53-dependent embryonal phenotypes. these functional attributes were shared between zebrafish and human Δnp <dig> orthologs ectopically expressed in zebrafish embryos. all  <dig> zebrafish isoforms could be coimmunoprecipitated with each other after transfection into saos <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
both alternative n-terminal p <dig> isoforms were expressed in developing zebrafish in response to cell stress and antagonized lethal effects of flp <dig> to different degrees. however, in contrast to Δ113p <dig>  forced Δnp <dig> expression itself led to developmental defects which depended, in part, on p <dig> transactivation. in contrast to flp <dig>  the developmental abnormalities caused by Δnp <dig> were not counteracted by concomitant expression of Δ113p <dig>
