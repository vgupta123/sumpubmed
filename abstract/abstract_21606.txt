BACKGROUND
identifying corresponding features  in multiple liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry  datasets plays a crucial role in the analysis of complex peptide or protein mixtures. warping functions are commonly used to correct the mean of elution time shifts among lc-ms datasets, which cannot resolve the ambiguity of corresponding feature identification since elution time shifts are random. we propose a statistical corresponding feature identification algorithm based on both elution time shifts and peak shape correlations between corresponding features. scfia first trains a set of statistical models, and then, all candidate corresponding features are scored by the statistical models to find the maximum likelihood solution.


RESULTS
we test scfia on publicly available datasets. we first compare its performance with that of warping function based methods, and the results show significant improvements. the performance of scfia on replicates datasets and fractionated datasets is also evaluated. in both cases, the accuracy is above 90%, which is near optimal. finally the coverage of scfia is evaluated, and it is shown that scfia can find corresponding features in multiple datasets for over 90% peptides identified by tandem ms.


CONCLUSIONS
scfia can be used for accurate corresponding feature identification in lc-ms. we have shown that peak shape correlation can be used effectively for improving the accuracy. scfia provides high coverage in corresponding feature identification in multiple datasets, which serves the basis for integrating multiple lc-ms measurements for accurate peptide quantification.
