BACKGROUND
marbofloxacin is a third-generation fluoroquinolone developed solely for veterinary medicine with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against some gram-positive and most gram-negative bacteria, including the bovine respiratory tract pathogen, pasteurella multocida. the objective of our study was to elucidate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of marbofloxacin in a pasteurella multocida infected murine lung model, and to estimate the magnitudes of pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics parameters associated with various effects.


RESULTS
the pharmacokinetic studies revealed marbofloxacin kinetics in infected mice were linear over a dose ranging from  <dig>  to 10 mg/kg of body weight. the protein binding in the plasma of neutropenic infected mice was  <dig>  %. the magnitudes of the ratio of the free-drug area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h to mic  associated with static effect, a  <dig> log <dig> reduction and a  <dig> log <dig> reduction of bacterial counts were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  h, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
based on the dose range study, marbofloxacin exhibited concentration-dependent killing and the fauc/mic was the pk/pd index that correlated best with efficacy . on the basis of a bactericidal effect goal of fauc0-24h/mic of  <dig>  h, if marbofloxacin is used for the treatment of p. multocida serious lung infection with an mic <dig> of  <dig>  μg/ml, the current dose  would fail to achieve a bactericidal effect. it would benefit from higher doses  than those commonly used in clinical practice.
