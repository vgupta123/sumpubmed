BACKGROUND
killer immunoglobulin-like receptors  are essential immuno-surveillance molecules. they are expressed on natural killer and t cells, and interact with human leukocyte antigens. kir genes are highly polymorphic and contribute vital variability to our immune system. numerous kir genes, belonging to five distinct lineages, have been identified in all primates examined thus far and shown to be rapidly evolving. since few kir remain orthologous between species, with only one of them, kir2dl <dig>  shown to be common to human, apes and monkeys, the evolution of the kir gene family in primates remains unclear.


RESULTS
using comparative analyses, we have identified the ancestral kir lineage  in primates. we show kir3dl <dig> to be highly conserved with the identification of orthologues in human , common chimpanzee , gorilla , rhesus monkey  and common marmoset . we predict kir3dl <dig> to encode a functional molecule in all primates by demonstrating expression in human, chimpanzee and rhesus monkey. using the rhesus monkey as a model, we further show the expression profile to be typical of kir by quantitative measurement of kir3dl <dig> from an enriched population of natural killer cells.


CONCLUSIONS
one reason why kir3dl <dig> may have escaped discovery for so long is that, in human, it maps in between two related leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor clusters outside the known kir gene cluster on chromosome  <dig>  based on genomic, cdna, expression and phylogenetic data, we report a novel lineage of immunoglobulin receptors belonging to the kir family, which is highly conserved throughout  <dig> million years of primate evolution.
