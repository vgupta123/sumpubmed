BACKGROUND
lipopolysaccharide  is a gram-negative bacterial antigen that triggers a series of cellular responses. lps pre-conditioning was previously shown to improve the therapeutic efficacy of bone marrow stromal cells/bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells  for repairing ischemic, injured tissue.


RESULTS
in this study, we systematically evaluated the effects of lps treatment on genome-wide splicing pattern changes in mouse bmscs by comparing transcriptome sequencing data from control vs. lps-treated samples, revealing  <dig> exons whose bmsc splicing patterns were altered by lps. functional analysis of these alternatively spliced genes demonstrated significant enrichment of phosphoproteins, zinc finger proteins, and proteins undergoing acetylation. additional bioinformatics analysis strongly suggest that lps-induced alternatively spliced exons could have major effects on protein functions by disrupting key protein functional domains, protein-protein interactions, and post-translational modifications.


CONCLUSIONS
although it is still to be determined whether such proteome modifications improve bmsc therapeutic efficacy, our comprehensive splicing characterizations provide greater understanding of the intracellular mechanisms that underlie the therapeutic potential of bmscs.
