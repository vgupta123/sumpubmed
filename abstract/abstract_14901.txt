BACKGROUND
postweaning diarrhoea  in pigs is usually the main infectious problem of large-scale farms and is responsible for significant losses worldwide. the disease is caused mainly by enterotoxigenic e. coli  and shiga-toxin producing e. coli . in this study a total of  <dig> e. coli isolated from pigs with pwd in slovakia were characterized using phenotypic and genotypic methods.


RESULTS
these  <dig> isolates belonged to  <dig> o:h serotypes. however, 57% of the isolates belonged to only six serotypes , including two new serotypes  not previously found among porcine etec and stec isolated in other countries. genes for east <dig>  stb, sta, lt and stx2e toxins were identified in 64%, 46%, 26%, 20%, and 5% of isolates, respectively. pcr showed that 35% of isolates carried genes for f <dig> colonization factor, and further analyzed by restriction endonuclease revealed that all of them were f18ac. genes for f <dig> , f <dig> , f <dig>  f <dig> , f <dig>  and intimin  adhesins were detected in  <dig> %, 5%, 3%,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the isolates, respectively. the study of genetic diversity, carried out by pfge of  <dig> representative etec and stec isolates, revealed  <dig> distinct restriction profiles clustered in eight groups. isolates of the same serotype were placed together in the dendrogram, but high degree of polymorphism among certain serotypes was detected.


CONCLUSIONS
seropathotype o149:h <dig> lt/stb/east1/f <dig>  was the most commonly detected followed by o163:h- east1/f <dig> , and ont:h <dig> sta/stb/stx2e/f <dig> . interestingly, this study shows that two new serotypes  have emerged as pig pathogens in slovakia. furthermore, our results show that there is a high genetic variation mainly among etec of o149:h <dig> serotype.
