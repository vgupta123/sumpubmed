BACKGROUND
resequencing can be used to identify genome variations underpinning many morphological and physiological phenotypes. legume model plant medicago truncatula ecotypes jemalong a <dig>  and r <dig> differ in their responses to mineral toxicity of aluminum and sodium, and mineral deficiency of iron in growth medium. the difference may result from their genome variations, but no experimental evidence supports this hypothesis.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  structure variations,  <dig>  short insertions/deletions and  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified by resequencing the genome of r <dig>  the suppressed expression of mtaact that encodes a putative aluminum-induced citrate efflux transporter by deletion of partial sequence of the second intron may account for the less aluminum-induced citrate exudation and greater accumulation of aluminum in roots of r <dig> than in roots of j. a <dig>  thus rendering r <dig> more sensitive to aluminum toxicity. the higher expression-level of mtzpt2- <dig> encoding a tfiiia-related transcription factor in j. a <dig> than r <dig> under conditions of salt stress can be explained by the greater number of stress-responsive elements in its promoter sequence, thus conferring j. a <dig> more tolerant to salt stress than r <dig> plants by activating the expression of downstream stress-responsive genes. ysls  are involved in long-distance transport of iron in plants. we found that an ysl gene was deleted in the genome of r <dig> plants, thus rendering r <dig> less tolerance to iron deficiency than j. a <dig> plants.


CONCLUSIONS
the deletion or change in several genes may account for the different responses of m. truncatula ecotypes j. a <dig> and r <dig> to mineral toxicity of aluminum and sodium as well as iron deficiency. uncovering genome variations by resequencing is an effective method to identify different traits between species/ecotypes that are genetically related. these findings demonstrate that analyses of genome variations by resequencing can shed important light on differences in responses of m. truncatula ecotypes to abiotic stress in general and mineral stress in particular.
