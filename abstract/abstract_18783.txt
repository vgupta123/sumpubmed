BACKGROUND
an increase in the activity of the pituitary-gonad axis  and gonad development are essential for the onset of spawning migration in teleosts. in the fish coilia nasus, gonad development and spawning migration up the yangtze river occurs by the end of each summer. we hypothesized that gonadotropin releasing hormones receptor  <dig> , which together produce a signal that interacts with the pg-axis, may help to regulate spawning migration processes.


RESULTS
in this regard, we  characterized the gonadosomatic index  in the anadromous fish c. nasus;  analyzed the gnrh-r <dig> mrna expression levels in ovary and brain, and concentrations in the serum; and  identified the gnrh-r <dig> protein distribution in the brain and ovaries. we found strong relationships between all of these indices.


CONCLUSIONS
the results indicate that gnrh-r <dig> could act together to promote spawning during the anadromous migration. there is some evidence that the gnrh-r <dig> gene expression levels and protein distributions change in association with the migratory behavior.
