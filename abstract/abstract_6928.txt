BACKGROUND

lactococcus lactis is among the most widely studied lactic acid bacterial species due to its long history of safe use and economic importance to the dairy industry, where it is exploited as a starter culture in cheese production.


RESULTS
in the current study, we report on the complete sequencing of  <dig> l. lactis subsp. lactis and l. lactis subsp. cremoris genomes. the chromosomal features of these  <dig> l. lactis strains in conjunction with  <dig> completely sequenced, publicly available lactococcal chromosomes were assessed with particular emphasis on discerning the l. lactis subspecies division, evolution and niche adaptation. the deduced pan-genome of l. lactis was found to be closed, indicating that the representative data sets employed for this analysis are sufficient to fully describe the genetic diversity of the taxon.


CONCLUSIONS
niche adaptation appears to play a significant role in governing the genetic content of each l. lactis subspecies, while  genome decay and redundancy in the dairy niche is also highlighted.
