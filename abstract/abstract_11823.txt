BACKGROUND
paulownia witches’ broom  is a fatal disease of paulownia caused by a phytoplasma. in previous studies, we found that plants with pawb symptoms would revert to a healthy morphology after methyl methane sulfonate  treatment. to completely understand the gene expression profiles of the paulownia-phytoplasma interaction, three high-throughput sequencing technologies were used to investigate changes of gene expression and micrornas  in healthy paulownia tomentosa plantlets, pawb-infected plantlets, and pawb-infected plantlets treated with 60 mg · l− <dig> mms.

methods
transcriptome, mirnas and degradome sequencing were performed to explore the global gene expression profiles in the process of paulownia tomentosa with phytoplasma infection.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  all-unigenes,  <dig> conserved mirnas, and  <dig> novel mirnas were obtained, among which  <dig> differentially expressed genes  and  <dig> mirnas were found to be associated with pawb disease. subsequently, the target genes of these mirnas were predicted by degradome sequencing. interestingly, we found that  <dig> target genes of these differentially expressed mirnas were among the  <dig> degs. the targets of pau-mir156g, pau-mir <dig>  and pau-mir166c were significantly up-regulated in the p. tomentosa plantlets infected with phytoplasma. interaction of mirna -target genes mediated gene expression related to pawb were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
the results elucidated the possible roles of the regulation of genes and mirnas in the paulownia-phytoplasma interaction, which will enrich our understanding of the mechanisms of pawb disease in this plant.
