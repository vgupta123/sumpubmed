BACKGROUND
covalent linkage of the ubiquitin-like protein isg <dig> interferes with viral infection and usp <dig> is the major protease which specifically removes isg <dig> from target proteins. thus, boosting isg <dig> modification by protease inhibition of usp <dig> might represent a new strategy to interfere with viral replication. however, so far no heterologous expression system was available to yield sufficient amounts of catalytically active protein for high-throughput based inhibitor screens.


RESULTS
high-level heterologous expression of usp <dig> was achieved by applying a chaperone-based fusion system in e. coli. pure protein was obtained in a single-step on imac via a his6-tag. the usp <dig> fusion protein exhibited enzymatic activity towards cell derived isg <dig> conjugated substrates and efficiently hydrolyzed isg15-amc. specificity towards isg <dig> was shown by covalent adduct formation with isg <dig> vinyl sulfone but not with ubiquitin vinyl sulfone.


CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here show that a chaperone fusion system can provide high yields of proteins that are difficult to express. the usp <dig> protein obtained here is suited to setup high-throughput small molecule inhibitor screens and forms the basis for detailed biochemical and structural characterization.
