BACKGROUND
ctbt  increases efficacy of commonly used antifungal agents by an unknown mechanism. it increases the susceptibility of saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans and candida glabrata cells to cycloheximide, 5-fluorocytosine and azole antimycotic drugs. here we elucidate ctbt mode of action with a combination of systematic genetic and transcriptome analysis.


RESULTS
to identify the cellular processes affected by ctbt, we screened the systematic haploid deletion mutant collection for ctbt sensitive mutants. we identified  <dig> hypersensitive deletion mutants. the deleted genes encode proteins mainly involved in mitochondrial functions, dna repair, transcription and chromatin remodeling, and oxidative stress response. we found that the susceptibility of yeast cells to ctbt depends on molecular oxygen. transcriptome analysis of the immediate early response to ctbt revealed rapid induction of oxidant and stress response defense genes. many of these genes depend on the transcription factors yap <dig> and cin <dig>  yap <dig> accumulates rapidly in the nucleus in ctbt treated cells suggesting acute oxidative stress. moreover, molecular calculations supported a superoxide generating activity of ctbt. superoxide production in vivo by ctbt was found associated to mitochondria as indicated by oxidation of mitosox red.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that ctbt causes intracellular superoxide production and oxidative stress in fungal cells and is thus enhancing antimycotic drug effects by a secondary stress.
