BACKGROUND
pink <dig> is a mitochondria-targeted kinase that constitutively localizes to both the mitochondria and the cytosol. the mechanism of how pink <dig> achieves cytosolic localization following mitochondrial processing remains unknown. understanding pink <dig> subcellular localization will give us insights into pink <dig> functions and how mutations in pink <dig> lead to parkinson's disease. we asked how the mitochondrial localization signal, the transmembrane domain, and the kinase domain participate in pink <dig> localization.


RESULTS
we confirmed that pink <dig> mitochondrial targeting signal is responsible for mitochondrial localization. once inside the mitochondria, we found that both pink <dig> transmembrane and kinase domain are important for membrane tethering and cytosolic-facing topology. we also showed that pink <dig> dual subcellular distribution requires both hsp <dig> interaction with the kinase domain and the proteolysis at a cleavage site downstream of the transmembrane domain because removal of this cleavage site completely abolished cytosolic pink <dig>  in addition, the disruption of the hsp90-pink <dig> interaction increased mitochondrial pink <dig> level.


CONCLUSIONS
together, we believe that once pink <dig> enters the mitochondria, pink <dig> adopts a tethered topology because the transmembrane domain and the kinase domain prevent pink <dig> forward movement into the mitochondria. subsequent proteolysis downstream of the transmembrane domain then releases pink <dig> for retrograde movement while pink <dig> kinase domain interacts with hsp <dig> chaperone. the significance of this dual localization could mean that pink <dig> has compartmental-specific functions.
