BACKGROUND
the aims of the current study were to evaluate the inflammatory response in cow uterus and to explore the molecular mechanism triggered by high concentrate-induced subacute ruminal acidosis  in mid-lactating dairy cows. twelve mid-lactating holstein cows with an average weight of 455 kg were allocated into two groups subjected to two diets for 18-weeks either a low-concentrate  group containing 4: <dig>  and a high-concentrate  group containing 6: <dig> :  ratio based on dry matter.


RESULTS
the hc group showed lower ruminal ph and higher lipopolysaccharide  concentrations in both the rumen and peripheral plasma compared to the lc group. the lps concentrations in the rumen fluid and the peripheral plasma were found significantly increased in the hc group compared to the lc group. the concentrations of il-1β, tnf-α and il- <dig> were significantly higher in the hc group compared to the lc group. the uterus of sara cows revealed elevated mrna concentrations of nuclear transcription factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which confirmed the presence of inflammation. the occurrence of uterine inflammation was further validated by the increased protein expression of nf-κb-p <dig> and its active phosphorylated variant in the uterus of sara cows. similarly, the inflammatory genes tlr <dig>  lbp, myd <dig>  traf- <dig>  nf-κb, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnf-α and il-1β were significantly upregulated in the uterus of the hc versus the lc group.


CONCLUSIONS
therefore, the results indicated that lps derived from the rumen triggered the genes associated with inflammation in the uterus of mid-lactating dairy cows fed a high-concentrate diet, causing endometritis.
