BACKGROUND
ethiopia bears the largest burden of foodborne diseases in africa, and diarrheal diseases are the second leading causes of premature deaths. enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o <dig> causes an asymptomatic infection to severe diarrhea and/or hemolytic-uremic syndrome in humans.

methods
a total of  <dig> beef carcass and in-contact surface swabs from  <dig> butcher shops and  <dig> minced beef samples from  <dig> restaurants in central ethiopia were collected and examined for the presence of e. coli o <dig>  standard microbiological methods were used to isolate and identify e. coli o <dig> and to characterize the antimicrobial resistance of the isolates.


RESULTS

e. coli o <dig> was detected in  <dig> % carcass swabs  and  <dig> % cutting board swabs  samples from butcher shops. e. coli o <dig> was not detected in any of the minced beef samples obtained from restaurants. all isolates  were 100% susceptible to five drugs, but five isolates were resistant to amoxicillin, two isolates to streptomycin and three isolates to chloramphenicol. one isolate was resistant to two drugs and another to three drugs.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study shows a low prevalence of e. coli o <dig> in beef sold at butcher shops. nevertheless, given the low infective dose of this pathogen and the deep-rooted tradition of consuming raw or undercooked beef, the current prevalence should not be considered lightly from a public health perspective.
