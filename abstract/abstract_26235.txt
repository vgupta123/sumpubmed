BACKGROUND
though potentially linked to the basic physiology of stress response we still have no clear understanding of gulf war illness , a debilitating condition presenting complex immune, endocrine and neurological symptoms. here we compared male  and female  veterans with gwi separately against their healthy counterparts  as well as subjects with chronic fatigue syndrome/ myalgic encephalomyelitis  .

methods
subjects were assessed using a graded exercise test  with blood drawn prior to exercise, at peak effort  and 4-hours post exercise. using chemiluminescent imaging we measured the concentrations of il-1a, 1b,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  ifnγ, tnfα and tnfβ in plasma samples from each phase of exercise. linear classification models were constructed using stepwise variable selection to identify cytokine co-expression patterns characteristic of each subject group.


RESULTS
classification accuracies in excess of 80% were obtained using between  <dig> and  <dig> cytokine markers. common to both gwi and cfs, il- <dig> and il- <dig> expression contributed in an illness and time-dependent manner, accompanied in male subjects by nk and th <dig> markers il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and ifnγ. in female gwi and cfs subjects il- <dig> was again identified as a delineator but this time in the context of il- <dig> and th <dig> markers il- <dig> and il- <dig>  exercise response also differed between sexes: male gwi subjects presented characteristic cytokine signatures at rest but not at peak effort whereas the opposite was true for female subjects.


CONCLUSIONS
though individual markers varied, results collectively supported involvement of the il-23/th17/il- <dig> axis in the delineation of gwi and cfs in a sex-specific way.
