BACKGROUND
the important greenhouse gas  methane is produced naturally in anaerobic wetland soils. by affecting the production, oxidation and transport of methane to the atmosphere, plants have a major influence upon the quantities emitted by wetlands. different species and functional plant groups have been shown to affect these processes differently, but our knowledge about how these effects are influenced by abiotic factors such as water regime and temperature remains limited. here we present a mesocosm experiment comparing eight plant species for their effects on internal transport and overall emissions of methane under contrasting hydrological conditions. to quantify how much methane was transported internally through plants , we blocked diffusion from the soil surface with an agar seal.


RESULTS
we found that graminoids caused higher methane emissions than forbs, although the emissions from mesocosms with different species were either lower than or comparable to those from control mesocosms with no plant . species with a relatively greater root volume and a larger biomass exhibited a larger chimney effect, though overall methane emissions were negatively related to plant biomass. emissions were also reduced by lowering the water table.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that plant species  vary in the degree to which they transport methane to the atmosphere. however, a plant with a high capacity to transport methane does not necessarily emit more methane, as it may also cause more rhizosphere oxidation of methane. a shift in plant species composition from graminoids to forbs and/or from low to high productive species may lead to reduction of methane emissions.
