BACKGROUND
the cause of neuronal death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  is uncertain but mitochondrial dysfunction may play an important role. ketones promote mitochondrial energy production and membrane stabilization.


RESULTS
sod1-g93a transgenic als mice were fed a ketogenic diet  based on known formulations for humans. motor performance, longevity, and motor neuron counts were measured in treated and disease controls. because mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in neuronal cell death in als, we also studied the effect that the principal ketone body, d-Î²- <dig> hydroxybutyrate , has on mitochondrial atp generation and neuroprotection. blood ketones were >  <dig>  times higher in kd fed animals compared to controls. kd fed mice lost 50% of baseline motor performance  <dig> days later than disease controls. kd animals weighed  <dig>  g more than disease control animals at study endpoint; the interaction between diet and change in weight was significant . in spinal cord sections obtained at the study endpoint, there were more motor neurons in kd fed animals . dbh prevented rotenone mediated inhibition of mitochondrial complex i but not malonate inhibition of complex ii. rotenone neurotoxicity in smi- <dig> immunopositive motor neurons was also inhibited by dbh.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study showing that diet, specifically a kd, alters the progression of the clinical and biological manifestations of the g93a sod <dig> transgenic mouse model of als. these effects may be due to the ability of ketone bodies to promote atp synthesis and bypass inhibition of complex i in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.
