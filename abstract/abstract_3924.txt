BACKGROUND
stallion fertility is an economically important trait due to the increase of artificial insemination in horses. the availability of whole genome sequence data facilitates identification of rare high-impact variants contributing to stallion fertility. the aim of our study was to genotype rare high-impact variants retrieved from next-generation sequencing -data of  <dig> horses in order to unravel harmful genetic variants in large samples of stallions.

methods
gene ontology  terms and search results from public databases were used to obtain a comprehensive list of human und mice genes predicted to participate in the regulation of male reproduction. the corresponding equine orthologous genes were searched in whole genome sequence data of seven stallions and four mares and filtered for high-impact genetic variants using snpeff, sift and polyphen  <dig> software. all genetic variants with the missing homozygous mutant genotype were genotyped on  <dig> fertile stallions of  <dig> breeds using kasp genotyping assays or pcr-rflp. mixed linear model analysis was employed for an association analysis with de-regressed estimated breeding values of the paternal component of the pregnancy rate per estrus .


RESULTS
we screened next generation sequenced data of whole genomes from  <dig> horses for equine genetic variants in  <dig> human and mice genes involved in male fertility and linked through common gene ontology  with male reproductive processes. variants were filtered for high-impact on protein structure and validated through sift and polyphen  <dig>  only those genetic variants were followed up when the homozygote mutant genotype was missing in the detection sample comprising  <dig> horses. after this filtering process,  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphism  were left. these snps were genotyped in  <dig> fertile stallions of  <dig> breeds using kasp genotyping assays or pcr-rflp. an association analysis in  <dig> hanoverian stallions revealed a significant association of the splice-site disruption variant g.37455302g>a in notch <dig> with the de-regressed estimated breeding values of the paternal component of the pregnancy rate per estrus . for  <dig> high-impact variants within the genes cftr, ovgp <dig>  fbxo <dig>  tssk <dig>  pkd <dig>  foxp <dig>  tcp <dig>  spata31e <dig> and notch <dig>  absence of the homozygous mutant genotype in the validation sample of all  <dig> fertile stallions was obvious. therefore, these variants were considered as potentially deleterious factors for stallion fertility.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study revealed  <dig> genetic variants with a predicted high damaging effect on protein structure and missing homozygous mutant genotype. the g.37455302g>a notch <dig> variant was identified as a significant stallion fertility locus in hanoverian stallions and further  <dig> candidate fertility loci with missing homozygous mutant genotypes were validated in a panel including  <dig> horse breeds. to our knowledge this is the first study in horses using next generation sequencing data to uncover strong candidate factors for stallion fertility.
