BACKGROUND
brazil nut is a protein-rich extractivist tree crop in the amazon region. fungal contamination of shells and kernel material frequently includes the presence of aflatoxigenic aspergillus species from the section flavi. aflatoxins are polyketide secondary metabolites, which are hepatotoxic carcinogens in mammals. the objectives of this study were to identify aspergillus species occurring on brazil nut grown in different states in the brazilian amazon region and develop a specific pcr method for collective identification of member species of the genus aspergillus.


RESULTS
polyphasic identification of  <dig> aspergillus strains isolated from brazil nut shell material from cooperatives across the brazilian amazon states of acre, amap√° and amazonas revealed five species, with aspergillus section flavi species a. nomius and a. flavus the most abundant. pcr primers asp_gen_mtssu_f <dig> and asp_gen_mtssu_r <dig> were designed for the genus aspergillus, targeting a portion of the mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal rna gene. primer specificity was validated through both electronic pcr against target gene sequences at genbank and in pcr reactions against dna from aspergillus species and other fungal genera common on brazil nut. collective differentiation of the observed section flavi species a. flavus, a. nomius and a. tamarii from other aspergillus species was possible on the basis of rflp polymorphism.


CONCLUSIONS
given the abundance of aspergillus section flavi species a. nomius and a. flavus observed on brazil nut, and associated risk of mycotoxin accumulation, simple identification methods for such mycotoxigenic species are of importance for hazard analysis critical control point system implementation. the assay for the genus aspergillus represents progress towards specific pcr identification and detection of mycotoxigenic species.
