BACKGROUND
the completion of maize genome sequencing has resulted in the identification of a large number of uncharacterized genes. gene annotation and functional characterization of gene products are important to uncover novel protein functionality.


RESULTS
in this paper, we identify, and annotate members of all the maize aldehyde dehydrogenase  gene superfamily according to the revised nomenclature criteria developed by aldh gene nomenclature committee . the maize genome contains  <dig> unique aldh sequences encoding members of ten aldh protein families including the previously identified male fertility restoration rf2a gene, which encodes a member of mitochondrial class  <dig> aldhs. using computational modeling analysis we report here the identification, the physico-chemical properties, and the amino acid residue analysis of a novel tunnel like cavity exclusively found in the maize sterility restorer protein, rf2a/aldh2b <dig> by which this protein is suggested to bind variably long chain molecular ligands and/or potentially harmful molecules.


CONCLUSIONS
our finding indicates that maize aldh superfamily is the most expanded of plant aldhs ever characterized, and the mitochondrial maize rf2a/aldh2b <dig> is the only plant aldh that harbors a newly defined pocket/cavity with suggested functional specificity.
