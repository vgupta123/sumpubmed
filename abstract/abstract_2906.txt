BACKGROUND
we present a picture of the biodiversity of mycobacterium tuberculosis in paraguay, an inland south american country harboring  <dig> million inhabitants with a tuberculosis notification rate of 38/ <dig> .


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> strains collected throughout the country in  <dig> were classified by spoligotyping into  <dig> different patterns. spoligopatterns of  <dig> strains matched  <dig> shared international types  already present in an updated version of spoldb <dig>  the global spoligotype database at pasteur institute, guadeloupe. our study contributed to the database  <dig> new sits and  <dig> orphan spoligopatterns. frequencies of major m. tuberculosis spoligotype lineages in our sample were as follows: latin-american & mediterranean   <dig> %, haarlem  <dig> %, s clade  <dig> %, t superfamily  <dig> %, x clade  <dig> % and beijing clade  <dig> %. concordant clustering by is <dig> restriction fragment length polymorphism  and spoligotyping identified transmission in specific settings such as the tacumbu jail in asuncion and aboriginal communities in the chaco. lam genotypes were ubiquitous and predominated among both rflp clusters and new patterns, suggesting ongoing transmission and adaptative evolution in paraguay. we describe a new and successfully evolving clone of the haarlem  <dig> sub-lineage, sit <dig>  which is thus far restricted to paraguay. we confirmed its clonality by rflp and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit  typing; we named it "tacumbu" after the jail where it was found to be spreading. one-fifth of the spoligopatterns in our study are rarely or never seen outside paraguay and one-tenth do not fit within any of the major phylogenetic clades in spoldb <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
lineages currently thriving in paraguay may reflect local host-pathogen adaptation of strains introduced during past migrations from europe.
