BACKGROUND
in this paper, we introduce a progressive corner cutting method called reticular alignment for multiple sequence alignment. unlike previous corner-cutting methods, our approach does not define a compact part of the dynamic programming table. instead, it defines a set of optimal and suboptimal alignments at each step during the progressive alignment. the set of alignments are represented with a network to store them and use them during the progressive alignment in an efficient way. the program contains a threshold parameter on which the size of the network depends. the larger the threshold parameter and thus the network, the deeper the search in the alignment space for better scored alignments.


RESULTS
we implemented the program in the java programming language, and tested it on the balibase database. reticular alignment can outperform clustalw even if a very simple scoring scheme  is implemented and merely the threshold value is increased. however, this set-up is not sufficient for outperforming other cutting-edge alignment methods. on the other hand, the reticular alignment search strategy together with sophisticated scoring schemes  overcome fsa and in some accuracy measurement, even mafft. the program is available from http://phylogeny-cafe.elte.hu/retalign/


CONCLUSIONS
reticular alignment is an efficient search strategy for finding accurate multiple alignments. the highest accuracy achieved when this searching strategy is combined with sophisticated scoring schemes.
