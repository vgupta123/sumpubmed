BACKGROUND
marbofloxacin is a veterinary fluoroquinolone with high activity against pasteurella multocida. we evaluated it’s in vivo activity against p. multocida based on in vivo time-kill data in swine using a tissue-cage model. a series of dosages ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/kg were administered intramuscularly after challenge with p. multocida type b, serotype  <dig> 


RESULTS
the ratio of the 24 h area under the concentration-time curve divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration  was the best pk/pd index correlated with the in vivo antibacterial effectiveness of marbofloxacin . the auc24tcf/mic necessary to achieve a 1-log <dig> cfu/ml reduction and a 3-log <dig> cfu/ml  reduction as calculated by an inhibitory sigmoid emax model were  <dig>  h and  <dig>  h, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
marbofloxacin is adequate for the treatment of swine infected with p. multocida. the tissue-cage model played a significant role in achieving these pk/pd results.
