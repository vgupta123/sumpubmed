BACKGROUND
the co-activator-associated arginine methyltransferase  <dig>  catalyzes the methylation of hur. however, the functional impact of this modification is not fully understood. here, we investigated the influence of hur methylation by carm <dig> upon the turnover of hur target mrnas encoding senescence-regulatory proteins.


RESULTS
changing the methylation status of hur in hela cells by either silencing carm <dig> or mutating the major methylation site  greatly diminished the effect of hur in regulating the turnover of mrnas encoding cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, sirt <dig>  and p <dig>  although knockdown of carm <dig> or hur individually influenced the expression of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, sirt <dig>  and p <dig>  joint knockdown of both carm <dig> and hur did not show further effect. methylation by carm <dig> enhanced the association of hur with the 3′utr of p <dig> mrna, but not with the 3′utr of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, or sirt <dig> mrnas. in senescent human diploid fibroblasts , reduced carm <dig> was accompanied by reduced hur methylation. in addition, knockdown of carm <dig> or mutation of the major methylation site of hur in hdf markedly impaired the ability of hur to regulate the expression of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, sirt <dig>  and p <dig> as well to maintain a proliferative phenotype.


CONCLUSIONS
carm <dig> represses replicative senescence by methylating hur and thereby enhancing hur’s ability to regulate the turnover of cyclin a, cyclin b <dig>  c-fos, sirt <dig>  and p <dig> mrnas.
