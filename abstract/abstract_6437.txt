BACKGROUND
vibrio taxonomy has been based on a polyphasic approach. in this study, we retrieve useful taxonomic information  from  <dig> genome sequences of different vibrio species. we use a variety of tools to explore the taxonomic relationship between the sequenced genomes, including multilocus sequence analysis , supertrees, average amino acid identity , genomic signatures, and genome blast atlases. our aim is to analyse the usefulness of these tools for species identification in vibrios.


RESULTS
we have generated four new genome sequences of three vibrio species, i.e., v. alginolyticus 40b, v. harveyi-like 1da <dig>  and v. mimicus strains vm <dig> and vm <dig>  and present a broad analyses of these genomes along with other sequenced vibrio species. the genome atlas and pangenome plots provide a tantalizing image of the genomic differences that occur between closely related sister species, e.g. v. cholerae and v. mimicus. the vibrio pangenome contains around  <dig> genes. the v. cholerae core genome and pangenome consist of  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. pangenomes might allow different strains of v. cholerae to occupy different niches. mlsa and supertree analyses resulted in a similar phylogenetic picture, with a clear distinction of four groups . a vibrio species is defined as a group of strains that share > 95% dna identity in mlsa and supertree analysis, > 96% aai, â‰¤  <dig> genome signature dissimilarity, and > 61% proteome identity. strains of the same species and species of the same genus will form monophyletic groups on the basis of mlsa and supertree.


CONCLUSIONS
the combination of different analytical and bioinformatics tools will enable the most accurate species identification through genomic computational analysis. this endeavour will culminate in the birth of the online genomic taxonomy whereby researchers and end-users of taxonomy will be able to identify their isolates through a web-based server. this novel approach to microbial systematics will result in a tremendous advance concerning biodiversity discovery, description, and understanding.
