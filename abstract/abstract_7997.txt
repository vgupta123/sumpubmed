BACKGROUND
mechanical wounding can cause morphological and developmental changes in plants, which may affect the responses to abiotic stresses. however, the mechano-stimulation triggered regulation network remains elusive. here, the mechano-stimulation was applied at two different times during the growth period of wheat before exposing the plants to cold stress  at the jointing stage.


RESULTS
results showed that mechano-stimulation at the zadoks growth stage  <dig> activated the antioxidant system, and substantially, maintained the homeostasis of reactive oxygen species. in turn, the stimulation improved the electron transport and photosynthetic rate of wheat plants exposed to cold stress at the jointing stage. proteomic and transcriptional analyses revealed that the oxidative stress defense, atp synthesis, and photosynthesis-related proteins and genes were similarly modulated by mechano-stimulation and the cold stress.


CONCLUSIONS
it was concluded that mechano-stimulated modifications of the chloroplast antioxidant system and proteome changes are related to cold tolerance in wheat. the findings might provide deeper insights into roles of reactive oxygen species in mechano-stimulated cold tolerance of photosynthetic apparatus, and be helpful to explore novel approaches to mitigate the impacts of low temperature occurring at critical developmental stages.
