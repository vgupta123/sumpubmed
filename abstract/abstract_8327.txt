BACKGROUND
embryonic lung development is instructed by crosstalk between mesenchyme and epithelia, which results in activation of transcriptional factors, such as sox <dig>  in a temporospatial manner. sox <dig> is expressed in both distal lung epithelium and proximal lung mesenchyme. here, we investigated the effect of lung mesenchyme-specific inducible deletion of sox <dig> during murine lung development.


RESULTS
transgenic mice lacking sox <dig> expression were unable to breathe and died at birth, with noticeable tracheal defects. cartilage rings were missing, and the tracheal lumen was collapsed in the mutant trachea. in situ hybridization showed an altered expression pattern of tbx <dig>  tbx <dig> and fgf <dig> genes and marked reduction of collagen <dig> expression in the tracheal mesenchyme. the tracheal phenotype was increasingly severe, with longer duration of deletion. lymphatic vasculature was underdeveloped in the mutant trachea: prox <dig>  lyve <dig>  and vegfr <dig> were decreased after sox <dig> knockout. we also found that compared with normal tracheal epithelium, the mutant tracheal epithelium had an altered morphology with fewer p63-positive cells and more cc10-positive cells, fewer goblet cells, and downregulation of surfactant proteins a and c.


CONCLUSIONS
the appropriate temporospatial expression of sox <dig> in lung mesenchyme is necessary for appropriate tracheal cartilage formation, lymphatic vasculature system development, and epithelial differentiation. we uncovered a novel mechanism of lung epithelium differentiation: tracheal cartilage rings instruct the tracheal epithelium to differentiate properly during embryonic development. thus, besides having a mechanical function, tracheal cartilage also appears to be a local signaling structure in the embryonic lung.
