BACKGROUND
although technical advances in genomics and proteomics research have yielded a better understanding of the coding capacity of a genome, one major challenge remaining is the identification of all expressed proteins, especially those less than  <dig> amino acids in length. such information can be particularly relevant to human pathogens, such as trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of african trypanosomiasis, since it will provide further insight into the parasite biology and life cycle.


RESULTS
starting with 993â€‰t. brucei transcripts, previously shown by rna-sequencing not to coincide with annotated coding sequences , homology searches revealed that  <dig> predicted short open reading frames in these transcripts are conserved across kinetoplastids with  <dig> also conserved in representative eukaryotes. mining mass spectrometry data sets revealed  <dig> transcripts encoding at least one matching peptide. rnai-induced down-regulation of these  <dig> transcripts revealed seven to be essential in insect-form trypanosomes with two also required for the bloodstream life cycle stage. to validate the specificity of the rnai results, each lethal phenotype was rescued by co-expressing an rnai-resistant construct of each corresponding cds. these previously non-annotated essential small proteins localized to a variety of cell compartments, including the cell surface, mitochondria, nucleus and cytoplasm, inferring the diverse biological roles they are likely to play in t. brucei. we also provide evidence that one of these small proteins is required for replicating the kinetoplast  dna.


CONCLUSIONS
our studies highlight the presence and significance of small proteins in a protist and expose potential new targets to block the survival of trypanosomes in the insect vector and/or the mammalian host.
