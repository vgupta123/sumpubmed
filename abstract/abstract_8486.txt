BACKGROUND
the major bottle neck in genetic and linkage studies in tomato has been the lack of a sufficient number of molecular markers. this has radically changed with the application of next generation sequencing and high throughput genotyping. a set of  <dig> snps was identified and  <dig> of them were used to evaluate tomato germplasm at the level of species, varieties and segregating populations.


RESULTS
from the  <dig> snps,  <dig> originated from 454-sequencing,  <dig> from illumina solexa sequencing and  <dig> were additional known markers. genotyping different tomato samples allowed the evaluation of the level of heterozygosity and introgressions among commercial varieties. cherry tomatoes were especially different from round/beefs in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  we were able to identify a set of  <dig> unique markers distinguishing s. lycopersicum ‘moneymaker’ from all its distantly related wild relatives. clustering and neighbour joining analysis among varieties and species showed expected grouping patterns, with s. pimpinellifolium as the most closely related to commercial tomatoesearlier results.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that a snp search in only a few breeding lines already provides generally applicable markers in tomato and its wild relatives. it also shows that the illumina bead array generated data are highly reproducible. our snps can roughly be divided in two categories: snps of which both forms are present in the wild relatives and in domesticated tomatoes  and snps unique for the domesticated tomato . the snps can be used for genotyping, identification of varieties, comparison of genetic and physical linkage maps and to confirm  relations. in the snps used for the array there is hardly any overlap with the solcap array and it is strongly recommended to combine both snp sets and to select a core collection of robust snps completely covering the entire tomato genome.
