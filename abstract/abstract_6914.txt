BACKGROUND
in modern paired-end sequencing protocols short dna fragments lead to adapter-appended reads. current paired-end adapter removal approaches trim adapter by scanning the fragment of adapter on the 3' end of the reads, which are not competent in some applications.


RESULTS
here, we propose a fast and highly accurate adapter-trimming algorithm, peat, designed specifically for paired-end sequencing. peat requires no a priori adaptor sequence, which is convenient for large-scale meta-analyses. we assessed the performance of peat with many adapter trimmers in both simulated and real life paired-end sequencing libraries. the importance of adapter trimming was exemplified by the influence of the downstream analyses on rna-seq, chip-seq and mnase-seq. several useful guidelines of applying adapter trimmers with aligners were suggested.


CONCLUSIONS
peat can be easily included in the routine paired-end sequencing pipeline. the executable binaries and the standalone c++ source code package of peat are freely available online.
