BACKGROUND
toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan parasite, infects almost all warm-blooded animals and humans. limited information is available about t. gondii infection in tibetan sheep in gansu province, northwestern china. in the present study, we estimated the seroprevalence and risk factors of t. gondii infection in this region of china.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> tibetan sheep were included from tianzhu and maqu in gansu province. antibodies to t. gondii were examined by modified agglutination test , and  <dig>  out of  <dig> tibetan sheep were found positive. multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the risk factors associated with seroprevalence, the results showed that age, gender, and numbers of past pregnancies were not the significant risk factors. however, tibetan sheep in maqu had a  <dig>  times  higher seroprevalence compared to tianzhu, and the seropositivity in summer were  <dig>  times  higher compared to tibetan sheep in winter, followed by  <dig>  times  in spring. thus, season and location were considered as risk factors associated with t. gondii infection in this study.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of t. gondii seroprevalence in tibetan sheep in gansu province, which enriches the epidemiological data of t. gondii infection in tibetan sheep in china. the results of this study indicate that tibetan sheep in gansu province are frequently exposed to t. gondii, posing a direct threat to the public health as well as to local sheep industry. these data is useful to strengthen future prevention and control of t. gondii infection in tibetan sheep in this region.
