BACKGROUND
mutations within the leucine-rich repeat kinase  <dig>  gene account for a significant proportion of autosomal-dominant and some late-onset sporadic parkinson's disease. elucidation of lrrk <dig> protein function in health and disease provides an opportunity for deciphering molecular pathways important in neurodegeneration. in mammals, lrrk <dig> and lrrk <dig> protein comprise a unique family encoding a gtpase domain that controls intrinsic kinase activity. the expression profiles of the murine lrrk proteins have not been fully described and insufficiently characterized antibodies have produced conflicting results in the literature.


RESULTS
herein, we comprehensively evaluate twenty-one commercially available antibodies to the lrrk <dig> protein using mouse lrrk <dig> and human lrrk <dig> expression vectors, wild-type and lrrk2-null mouse brain lysates and human brain lysates. eleven antibodies detect over-expressed human lrrk <dig> while four antibodies detect endogenous human lrrk <dig>  in contrast, two antibodies recognize over-expressed mouse lrrk <dig> and one antibody detected endogenous mouse lrrk <dig>  lrrk <dig> protein resides in both soluble and detergent soluble protein fractions. lrrk <dig> and the related lrrk <dig> genes encode low levels of expressed mrna species corresponding to low levels of protein both during development and in adulthood with largely redundant expression profiles.


CONCLUSIONS
despite previously published results, commercially available antibodies generally fail to recognize endogenous mouse lrrk <dig> protein; however, several antibodies retain the ability to detect over-expressed mouse lrrk <dig> protein. over half of the commercially available antibodies tested detect over-expressed human lrrk <dig> protein and some have sufficient specificity to detect endogenous lrrk <dig> in human brain. the mammalian lrrk proteins are developmentally regulated in several tissues and coordinated expression suggest possible redundancy in the function between lrrk <dig> and lrrk <dig>
