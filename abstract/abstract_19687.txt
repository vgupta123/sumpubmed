BACKGROUND
epstein-barr virus  dna load monitoring is known to be useful for the diagnosis and monitoring of ebv-associated diseases. the aim of this study is to compare the performance of two real-time pcr assays for ebv dna: a commercial kit as the q-ebv real-time system  and an in-house assay .


RESULTS
the range of linearity and the degree of precision of the two assays were similar. the clinical sensitivity of q-ebv pcr was higher for reference samples containing less than  <dig>  ebv dna copies/ml. the absolute quantitative results of the two methods were statistically correlated , with the systematic overestimation by ebv rq-pcr possibly linked to different amplification efficiency in calibration standards.


CONCLUSIONS
both the commercial and the in-house assay may be appropriate for clinical use, but common standards are advisable for comparable absolute values, as these would improve the clinical utility of ebv dna load measurement.
