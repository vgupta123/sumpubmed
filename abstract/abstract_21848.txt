BACKGROUND
halomonas sp. zm <dig> was isolated from zelazny most post-flotation mineral waste repository , which is highly contaminated with heavy metals and various organic compounds. mobile dna of the strain  were analyzed in order to identify genetic information enabling adaptation of the bacterium to the harsh environmental conditions.


RESULTS
the analysis revealed that zm <dig> carries plasmid pzm3h <dig> , whose replication system may be considered as an archetype of a novel subgroup of incu-like replicons. pzm3h <dig> is a narrow host range, mobilizable plasmid  containing mercury resistance operon  and czcd genes , which are part of a large truncated tn <dig> family transposon. further analysis demonstrated that the phenotypes determined by the pzm3h <dig> resistance cassette are highly dependent on the host strain. in another strand of the study, the trap plasmid pmat <dig> was employed to identify functional transposable elements of halomonas sp. zm <dig>  using the sacb positive selection strategy two insertion sequences were identified: ishsp <dig> - representing is <dig> group of is <dig> family and ishsp <dig> - a distinct member of the is <dig> family.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides the first detailed description of mobile dna in a member of the family halomonadaceae. the identified incu plasmid pzm3h <dig> confers resistance phenotypes enabling adaptation of the host strain to the zelazny most environment. the extended comparative analysis has shed light on the distribution of related incu plasmids among bacteria, which, in many cases, reflects the frequency and direction of horizontal gene transfer events. our results also identify plasmid-encoded modules, which may form the basis of novel shuttle vectors, specific for this group of halophilic bacteria.
