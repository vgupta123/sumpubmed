BACKGROUND
the recent identification of several mutations in pfn <dig>  a protein involved in actin dynamics, strengthens the hypothesis that pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is linked to cytoskeletal defects. impaired actin binding is a common denominator of several pfn <dig> mutations associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, although further mechanisms may also contribute to the death of motor neurons. in this study we examine the actin binding properties of pfn <dig> carrying the causal t109m mutation and its effects on the actin cytoskeleton.

methods
actin binding of pfn <dig> t109m was examined by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, a split luciferase complementation assay and a pulldown assay with recombinant pfn <dig>  the actin cytoskeleton was investigated by fluorescence microscopy and by ultracentrifuge separation of globular and filamentous actin fractions followed by western blotting.


RESULTS
using different technical approaches we show that pfn <dig> t109m displays unaltered actin binding. furthermore we show that the actin cytoskeleton is not affected by pfn <dig> carrying the t109m mutation.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that actin independent mechanisms contribute to the pathogenicity of pfn <dig> t109m and possibly other pfn <dig> mutations.
