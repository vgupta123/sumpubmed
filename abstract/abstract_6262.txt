BACKGROUND
monoclonal antibodies have been employed as targeting molecules of superantigen for the preclinical treatment of a variety of tumours. however, other targeting molecules, such as tumour-related ligands or peptides, are less exploited. here, we tested other targeting molecules by genetically fusing the third loop of transforming growth factor alpha  to mutant staphylococcal enterotoxin a .


RESULTS
the resultant fusion proteins were expressed in e. coli and purified to homogeneity through a ni-nta affinity column. fusion protein tgfalphal3sead227a can promote splenocyte proliferation to a level comparable to recombinant sea  and bind to egfr-expressing tumour cells in an egfr-dependent way. consistent with these observations, tgfalphal3sead227a exerted an inhibitory effect on the growth of egfr-expressing tumour cells both in vitro and in vivo. notably, significant infiltrations of cd8+ and cd4+ t cells were detected in the tumour tissues of these c57bl/ <dig> mice treated with tgfalphal3sead227a, suggesting the involvement of t cells in this tumour-inhibitory process.


CONCLUSIONS
the data here showed that tgfαl <dig> is capable of targeting superantigen to tumours and exerting an inhibitory effect on tumour growth, which enables tgfαl3sead227a to be an attractive candidate for the immunotherapy of egfr-expressing tumours.
