BACKGROUND
for efficient and large scale production of recombinant proteins in plants transient expression by agroinfection has a number of advantages over stable transformation. simple manipulation, rapid analysis and high expression efficiency are possible. in pea, pisum sativum, a virus induced gene silencing system using the pea early browning virus has been converted into an efficient agroinfection system by converting the two rna genomes of the virus into binary expression vectors for agrobacterium transformation.


RESULTS
by vacuum infiltration  of germinating pea seeds with 2- <dig> cm roots with agrobacteria carrying the binary vectors, expression of the gene for green fluorescent protein as marker and the gene for the human acidic fibroblast growth factor  was obtained in 80% of the infiltrated developing seedlings. maximal production of the recombinant proteins was achieved 12- <dig> days after infiltration.


CONCLUSIONS
compared to the leaf injection method vacuum infiltration of germinated seeds is highly efficient allowing large scale production of plants transiently expressing recombinant proteins. the production cycle of plants for harvesting the recombinant protein was shortened from  <dig> days for leaf injection to  <dig> days by applying vacuum infiltration. the synthesized afgf was purified by heparin-affinity chromatography and its mitogenic activity on nih 3t <dig> cells confirmed to be similar to a commercial product.
