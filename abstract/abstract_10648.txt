BACKGROUND
recent developments in high-throughput genomic technologies make it possible to have a comprehensive view of genomic alterations in tumors on a whole genome scale. only a small number of somatic alterations detected in tumor genomes are driver alterations which drive tumorigenesis. most of the somatic alterations are passengers that are neutral to tumor cell selection. although most research efforts are focused on analyzing driver alterations, the passenger alterations also provide valuable information about the history of tumor development.


RESULTS
in this paper, we develop a method for estimating the age of the tumor lineage and the timing of the driver alterations based on the number of passenger alterations. this method also identifies mutator genes which increase genomic instability when they are altered and provides estimates of the increased rate of alterations caused by each mutator gene. we applied this method to copy number data and dna sequencing data for ovarian and lung tumors. we identified well known mutators such as tp <dig>  prkdc, brca1/ <dig> as well as new mutator candidates ppp2r2a and the chromosomal region 22q <dig> . we found that most mutator genes alter early during tumorigenesis and were able to estimate the age of individual tumor lineage in cell generations.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first computational method to identify mutator genes and to take into account the increase of the alteration rate by mutator genes, providing more accurate estimates of the tumor age and the timing of driver alterations.
