BACKGROUND
rh <dig> proteins belong to the family of ammonia permeases together with their amt/mep homologs. ammonia permeases increase the permeability of nh3/nh4
+ across cell membranes and are believed to be involved in excretion of toxic ammonia and in the maintenance of ph homeostasis. rh <dig> genes are widespread in eukaryotes but absent in land plants and fungi, and remarkably rare in prokaryotes. the evolutionary history of rh <dig> genes in prokaryotes is just beginning to be unveiled.


RESULTS
here, a molecular phylogenetic approach suggests horizontal gene transfer  as a primary force driving the evolution and spread of rh <dig> among prokaryotes. in addition, the taxonomic distribution of the rh <dig> gene among prokaryotes turned out to be very narrow; a single-copy rh <dig> is present in the genome of only a small proportion of bacteria, and, first evidence to date, in only three methanogens among euryarchaea. the coexistence of rh <dig> and amt in prokaryotes seems also a rare event. finally, phylogenetic analyses were used to reconstruct the hgt network along which prokaryotic rh <dig> evolution has taken place.


CONCLUSIONS
the eukaryotic or bacterial “origin” of the rh <dig> gene remains unsolved. the rh <dig> prokaryotic hgt network suggests a preferential directionality of transfer from aerobic to anaerobic organisms. the observed hgt events between archaeal methanogens, anaerobic and aerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria suggest that syntrophic relationships play a major role in the structuring of the network, and point to oxygen minimum zones as an ecological niche that might be of crucial importance for hgt-driven evolution.
