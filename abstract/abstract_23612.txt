BACKGROUND
segmental duplications  on 22q <dig>  , serve as substrates for meiotic non-allelic homologous recombination  events resulting in several clinically significant genomic disorders.


RESULTS
to understand the duplication activity leading to the complicated sd structure of this region, we have applied the a-bruijn graph algorithm to decompose the 22q <dig>  sds to  <dig> fundamental duplication sequences, termed subunits. cross-species syntenic analysis of primate genomes demonstrates that many of these lcr <dig> subunits emerged very recently, especially those implicated in human genomic disorders. some subunits have expanded more actively than others, and young alu sines, are associated much more frequently with duplicated sequences that have undergone active expansion, confirming their role in mediating recombination events. many copy number variations  exist on 22q <dig> , some flanked by sds. interestingly, two chromosome breakpoints for  <dig> cnvs  are located in paralogous subunits, providing direct evidence that sd subunits could contribute to cnv formation. sequence analysis of pacs or bacs identified extra cnvs, specifically,  <dig> insertions and  <dig> deletions within 22q <dig> ; four were more than  <dig> kb in size and most contained young aluys at their breakpoints.


CONCLUSIONS
our study indicates that aluys are implicated in the past and current duplication events, and moreover suggests that dna rearrangements in 22q <dig>  genomic disorders perhaps do not occur randomly but involve both actively expanded duplication subunits and alu elements.
