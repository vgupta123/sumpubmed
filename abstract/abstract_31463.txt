BACKGROUND
foot-and-mouth disease virus  is one of the highest risk factors that affects the animal industry of the country. the virus causes production loss and high ratio mortality in young cloven-hoofed animals in vietnam. the vp <dig> coding gene of  <dig> fmdv samples  collected from endemic outbreaks during 2006– <dig> were analyzed to investigate their phylogeny and genetic relationship with other available fmdvs globally.


RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis indicated that the serotype o strains were clustered into two distinct viral topotypes , while the serotype a strains were all clustered into the genotype ix. among the study strains, the amino acid sequence identities were shared at a level of  <dig> – <dig>   <dig> – <dig>  and  <dig> –100% for the topotypes sea, me-sa, and genotype ix, respectively. substitutions leading to changes in the amino acid sequence, which are critical for the vp <dig> antigenic sites were also identified. our results showed that the studied strains are most closely related to the recent fmdv isolates from southeast asian countries , but are distinct from the earlier fmdv isolates within the genotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides important evidence of recent movement of fmdvs serotype o and a into vietnam within the last decade and their genetic accumulation to be closely related to strains causing fmd in surrounding countries.
