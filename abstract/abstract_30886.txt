BACKGROUND
faba bean  is an important food legume crop, grown for human consumption globally including in china, turkey, egypt and ethiopia. although genetic gain has been made through conventional selection and breeding efforts, this could be substantially improved through the application of molecular methods. for this, a set of reliable molecular markers representative of the entire genome is required.


RESULTS
a library with  <dig>  putative ssr sequences was constructed and characterized for repeat type and length from a mixed genome of  <dig> spring and winter sown faba bean genotypes using  <dig> sequencing. a suit of  <dig>  primer pair sequences were designed and  <dig> were randomly selected for validation. of these,  <dig> produced reproducible amplicons that were polymorphic among  <dig> faba bean genotypes selected from diverse geographical locations. the number of alleles per locus ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  the expected heterozygocities ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and the observed heterozygosities ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the validation by upgma cluster analysis of  <dig> genotypes based on nei's genetic distance, showed high quality and effectiveness of those novel ssr markers developed via next generation sequencing technology.


CONCLUSIONS
large scale ssr marker development was successfully achieved using next generation sequencing of the v. faba genome. these novel markers are valuable for constructing genetic linkage maps, future qtl mapping, and marker-assisted trait selection in faba bean breeding efforts.
