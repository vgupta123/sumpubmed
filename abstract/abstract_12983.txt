BACKGROUND
roles of micrornas  and short interfering rnas  in biotic stress responses, e.g., viral infection, have been demonstrated in plants by many studies. tomato yellow leaf curl china virus  is a monopartite begomovirus that can systemically infect solanaceae plants, and induces leaf curling, yellowing and enation symptoms when co-inoculated with a betasatellite . the released genome sequence of nicotiana benthamiana provides an opportunity to identify mirnas and sirnas responsive to begomovirus-associated betasatellite in n. benthamiana.


RESULTS
mirnas were identified in three small rna libraries generated using rna isolated from n. benthamiana plants systemically infected with tylccnv  alone, co-infected with y10a and its betasatellite tylccnb  or a tylccnb mutant  that contains a mutated βc <dig>  the sole betasatellite-encoded protein. a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas from  <dig> families and  <dig> novel mirnas from  <dig> families were identified. northern blot analysis confirmed that expression of species-specific mirnas was much lower than that of conserved mirnas. several conserved and novel mirnas were found to be responsive to co-infection of y10a and y10β but not to co-infection of y10a and y10mβ, suggesting that these mirnas might play a role unique to interaction between y10β and n. benthamiana. additionally, we identified mirnas that can trigger the production of phased secondary sirnas .


CONCLUSIONS
identification of mirnas with differential expression profiles in n. benthamiana co-infected with y10a and y10β and co-infected with y10a and y10mβ indicates that these mirnas are betasatellite-responsive. our result also suggested a potential role of mirna-mediated production of phasirnas in interaction between begomovirus and n. benthamiana.
