BACKGROUND
dna target enrichment by micro-array capture combined with high throughput sequencing technologies provides the possibility to obtain large amounts of sequence data  from multiple individuals at relatively low costs. previously, whole mitochondrial genome data for domestic horses  were limited to only a few specimens and only short parts of the mtdna genome  were investigated for larger sample sets.


RESULTS
in this study we investigated whole mitochondrial genomes of  <dig> domestic horses from  <dig> breeds and a single przewalski horse  using a recently described multiplex micro-array capture approach. we found  <dig> variable positions within the domestic horses,  <dig> of which are parsimony-informative, providing a well resolved phylogenetic tree. our divergence time estimate suggests that the mitochondrial genomes of modern horse breeds shared a common ancestor around  <dig>  years ago and no later than  <dig>  years ago. a bayesian skyline plot  reveals a significant population expansion beginning  <dig> - <dig>  years ago with an ongoing exponential growth until the present, similar to other domestic animal species. our data further suggest that a large sample of wild horse diversity was incorporated into the domestic population; specifically, at least  <dig> of the mtdna lineages observed in domestic horses  already existed before the beginning of domestication about  <dig>  years ago.


CONCLUSIONS
our study provides a window into the maternal origins of extant domestic horses and confirms that modern domestic breeds present a wide sample of the mtdna diversity found in ancestral, now extinct, wild horse populations. the data obtained allow us to detect a population expansion event coinciding with the beginning of domestication and to estimate both the minimum number of female horses incorporated into the domestic gene pool and the time depth of the domestic horse mtdna gene pool.
