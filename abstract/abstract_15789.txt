BACKGROUND
biofilm formation is associated with various aspects of bacterial and fungal infection. this study was designed to assess the impact of diverse natural polyelectrolytes, such as dna, f-actin, neurofilaments , vimentin and purified pf <dig> bacteriophage on biofilm formation and swarming motility of select pathogens including pseudomonas aeruginosa associated with lung infections in cf patients.


RESULTS
the bacteriophage pf <dig>  significantly increased biofilm mass produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa p <dig>  escherichia coli rs <dig> and bacillus subtilis atcc <dig>  dna, f-actin, nfs and pf <dig> also increased biofilm mass of the fungal c. albicans  <dig> strain. addition of f-actin, dna or pf <dig> bacteriophage to  <dig> % agar plates increased swarming motility of pseudomonas aeruginosa xen <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the presence of polyelectrolytes at infection sites is likely to promote biofilm growth and bacterial swarming.
