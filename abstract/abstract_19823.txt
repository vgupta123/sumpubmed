BACKGROUND
today, thrombosis is one of the most widely occurring diseases in modern life. drugs with thrombolytic functions are the most effective methods in the treatment of thrombosis. among them, douchi fibrinolytic enzyme  is a promising agent. dfe was isolated from douchi, a typical and popular soybean-fermented food in china, and it can dissolve fibrin directly and efficiently. a strain, bacillus subtilis ld- <dig> produced dfe with high fibrinolytic activity has been isolated in our lab previously.


RESULTS
in the study, thrombolytic effect of dfe from bacillus subtilis ld- <dig> was studied in vitro and in vivo systematically. the results showed that dfe played a significant role in thrombolysis and anticoagulation in vitro. and the thrombolytic effects correlated with dfe in a dose-dependent manner. in vivo, the acute toxicity assay showed that dfe had no obvious acute toxicity to mice. test of carrageenan-induced thrombosis in mice indicated that the dfe significantly prevented tail thrombosis, and arterial thrombosis model test indicated that douchi fibrinolytic enzyme dfe had thrombolytic effect on carotid thrombosis of rabbits in vivo. other results in vivo indicated that dfe could increase bleeding and clotting time obviously.


CONCLUSIONS
the dfe isolated from bacillus subtilis ld- <dig> has obvious thrombolytic effects in vitro and in vivo. this function demonstrates that this enzyme can be a useful tool for preventing and treating clinical thrombus.
