BACKGROUND
many gram-negative bacteria rely on a type vi secretion system  to infect eukaryotic cells or to compete against other microbes. common to these systems is the presence of two conserved proteins, in vibrio cholerae denoted vipa and vipb, which have been shown to interact in many clinically relevant pathogens. in this study, mutagenesis of a defined region within the vipa protein was used to identify residues important for vipb binding in v. cholerae o <dig> strain a <dig> 


RESULTS
a dramatically diminished interaction was shown to correlate with a decrease in vipb stability and a loss of hemolysin co-regulated protein  secretion and rendered the bacterium unable to compete with escherichia coli in a competition assay.


CONCLUSIONS
this confirms the biological relevance of the vipa-vipb interaction, which is essential for the t6ss activity of many important human pathogens.
