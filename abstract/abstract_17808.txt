BACKGROUND
typhoid and paratyphoid fever are endemic in china. the objective of this investigation was to determine the molecular features of nalidixic acid-resistant salmonella enteric serovar typhi  and paratyphi  from blood isolates in shenzhen, china.


RESULTS
twenty-five s. typhi and  <dig> s. paratyphi were isolated from  <dig> bacteriemic patients between  <dig> and  <dig> at a hospital in shenzhen, southern china. fifty-two percent  of s. typhi and  <dig> %  of s. paratyphi a were resistant to nalidixic acid. sixty-seven isolates of nalidixic acid-resistant salmonella  showed decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin . all  <dig> nars isolates had a single substitution in the quinolone resistance-determining region  of gyra , and  <dig> % of these isolates carried the substitution ser83phe in gyra. no mutation was found in the qrdr of gyrb, parc, or pare. plasmid mediated quinolone resistance genes including qnr and aac-ib-cr were not detected in any isolate. twenty-two distinct pulsed field gel electrophoresis  patterns were observed among s. typhi. sixty-four isolates of s. paratyphi a belonged to one clone. eighty-seven investigated inpatients were infected in the community. six patients infected by s. paratyphi a had a travel history before infection.


CONCLUSIONS
nalidixic acid-resistant s. typhi and s. paratyphi a blood isolates were highly prevalent in shenzhen, china. pfge showed the variable genetic diversity of nalidixic acid-resistant s. typhi and limited genetic diversity of nalidixic acid -resistant s. paratyphi a.
