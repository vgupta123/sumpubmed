BACKGROUND
methicillin-resistant s. aureus  has been endemic in hospital universitari de bellvitge, barcelona, since  <dig>  during the 1990- <dig> period the iberian clone  was dominant. isolates of clonal complex  <dig>  gradually replaced the iberian clone from  <dig> to  <dig>  a new multiresistant mrsa phenotype showing rifampicin resistance emerged in  <dig> and rapidly increased from 25% in  <dig> to 45% in  <dig>  the aims of this study were i) the molecular characterisation of rifampicin resistant mrsa isolates, ii) the study of the rifampicin resistance expression by disk diffusion, microdilution and e-test, and iii) the analysis of the rpob gene mutations involved in rifampicin resistance.


RESULTS
a sample of representative  <dig> rifampicin-resistant mrsa isolates belonged to a single pfge genotype, st- <dig>  sccmec type i and spa type t <dig>  of  <dig> isolates,  <dig>  had a low-level rifampicin resistance  and  <dig> a high-level rifampicin resistance . disk diffusion and e-test methods failed to identify a low-level rifampicin resistance in  <dig> and  <dig> isolates, respectively. a low-level rifampicin resistance was associated with amino acid substitution 481his/asn in the beta-subunit of rna polymerase. isolates with a high-level rifampicin resistance carried additional mutations in the rpob gene.


CONCLUSIONS
the emergence of mrsa clone st228-sccmeci, related to the southern germany clone, involved a therapeutical challenge for treating serious mrsa infections. decreased susceptibility to rifampicin in mrsa strains of st228-sccmeci was associated with one or two specific mutations in the rpob gene. one fifth of isolates with low-level rifampicin-resistance were missed by the diffusion methods.
