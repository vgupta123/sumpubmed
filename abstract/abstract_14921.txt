BACKGROUND
many microorganisms have a wide temperature growth range and versatility to tolerate large thermal fluctuations in diverse environments, however not many have been fully explored over their entire growth temperature range through a holistic view of its physiology, genome, and transcriptome. we used exiguobacterium sibiricum strain 255- <dig>  a psychrotrophic bacterium from  <dig> million year old siberian permafrost that grows from -5°c to 39°c to study its thermal adaptation.


RESULTS
the e. sibiricum genome has one chromosome and two small plasmids with a total of  <dig>  protein-encoding genes , and a gc content of  <dig> %. the genome and transcriptome analysis along with the organism's known physiology was used to better understand its thermal adaptation. a total of 27%,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of e. sibiricum cds spotted on the dna microarray detected differentially expressed genes in cells grown at - <dig> °c, 10°c, and 39°c, respectively, when compared to cells grown at 28°c. the hypothetical and unknown genes represented  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the cds differentially expressed when grown at - <dig> °c, 10°c, and 39°c versus 28°c, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the results show that e. sibiricum is constitutively adapted to cold temperatures stressful to mesophiles since little differential gene expression was observed between 4°c and 28°c, but at the extremities of its arrhenius growth profile, namely - <dig> °c and 39°c, several physiological and metabolic adaptations associated with stress responses were observed.
