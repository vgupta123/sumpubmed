BACKGROUND
sm <dig> has long been studied as an actin-associated protein. interestingly, levels of sm <dig> are often reduced in tumour cell lines, while they are increased during senescence possibly indicating a role for sm <dig> in cell fate decisions via its interaction with actin. in this study we aimed to determine whether reducing levels of sm <dig> could actively contribute to a tumourigenic phenotype.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that in ref <dig> fibroblasts, decreased levels of sm <dig> disrupt normal actin organization leading to changes in the motile behaviour of cells. interestingly, sm <dig> depletion also led to an increase in the capacity of cells to spontaneously form podosomes with a concomitant increase in the ability to invade matrigel. in pc <dig> prostate epithelial cancer cells by contrast, where sm <dig> is undetectable, re-expression of sm <dig> reduced the ability to invade matrigel. furthermore sm <dig> depleted cells also had reduced levels of reactive oxygen species when under serum starvation stress.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that depletion of sm <dig> could contribute to tumourigenic properties of cells. reduction in sm <dig> levels would tend to promote cell survival when cells are under stress, such as in a hypoxic tumour environment, and may also contribute to increases in actin dynamics that favour metastatic potential.
