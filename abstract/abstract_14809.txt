BACKGROUND
peroxisomes house critical metabolic reactions. for example, fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes, which are essential during early seedling development, are peroxisomal. peroxins  are needed to bring proteins into peroxisomes. most matrix proteins are delivered to peroxisomes by pex <dig>  a receptor that forms transient pores to escort proteins across the peroxisomal membrane. after cargo delivery, a peroxisome-tethered ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme  and peroxisomal ubiquitin-protein ligases mono- or polyubiquitinate pex <dig> for recycling back to the cytosol or for degradation, respectively. arabidopsis pex mutants β-oxidize fatty acids inefficiently and therefore fail to germinate or grow less vigorously. these defects can be partially alleviated by providing a fixed carbon source, such as sucrose, in the growth medium. despite extensive characterization of peroxisome biogenesis in arabidopsis grown in non-challenged conditions, the effects of environmental stressors on peroxisome function and pex mutant dysfunction are largely unexplored.


RESULTS
we surveyed the impact of growth temperature on a panel of pex mutants and found that elevated temperature ameliorated dependence on external sucrose and reduced pex <dig> levels in the pex4- <dig> mutant. conversely, growth at low temperature exacerbated pex4- <dig> physiological defects and increased pex <dig> levels. overexpressing pex <dig> also worsened pex4- <dig> defects, implying that pex <dig> lingering on the peroxisomal membrane when recycling is impaired impedes peroxisome function. growth at elevated temperature did not reduce the fraction of membrane-associated pex <dig> in pex4- <dig>  suggesting that elevated temperature did not restore pex <dig> enzymatic function in the mutant. moreover, preventing autophagy in pex4- <dig> did not restore pex <dig> levels at high temperature. in contrast, mg <dig> treatment increased pex <dig> levels, implicating the proteasome in degrading pex <dig>  especially at high temperature.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that growth at elevated temperature increases proteasomal degradation of pex <dig> to reduce overall pex <dig> levels and ameliorate pex4- <dig> physiological defects. our results support the hypothesis that efficient retrotranslocation of pex <dig> after cargo delivery is needed not only to make pex <dig> available for further rounds of cargo delivery, but also to prevent the peroxisome dysfunction that results from pex <dig> lingering in the peroxisomal membrane.
