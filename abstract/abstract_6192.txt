BACKGROUND
single nucleotide polymorphisms , the most abundant variations in a
genome, have been widely used in various studies. detection and
characterization of citrus haplotype-based expressed sequence tag  snps
will greatly facilitate further utilization of these gene-based
resources.


RESULTS
in this paper, haplotype-based snps were mined out of publicly available
citrus expressed sequence tags  from different citrus cultivars
 individually and collectively for comparison. there were a total
of  <dig>  ests belonging to  <dig> cultivars in varying numbers and
consequentially yielding different numbers of haplotype-based quality snps.
sweet orange  had the most  ests, generating  <dig>  quality
snps in  <dig>  out of  <dig>  usable contigs. summed from all the individually
mining results, a total of  <dig>  quality snps were discovered –
 <dig>   were transitions ,  <dig>   were
transversions , and  <dig>   were
insertion/deletions . a vast majority of snp-containing contigs
consisted of only  <dig> haplotypes, as expected, but the percentages of 2
haplotype contigs varied widely in these citrus cultivars. blast of the
 <dig>  25-mer snp oligos to the clementine reference genome scaffolds
revealed  <dig>  snps had “no hits found”,  <dig>  had  <dig> unique hit
/ alignment,  <dig>  had one hit and 2+ alignments per hit, and  <dig> had 2+
hits and 1+ alignment per hit. of the total  <dig>  scaffold hits,  <dig> 
 were on the main scaffolds  <dig> to  <dig>  and only  <dig> were on  <dig> minor
scaffolds. most alignments had 100%  or 96%  nucleotide
identities, accounting for 93% of all the alignments. considering almost all
the nucleotide discrepancies in the 24/ <dig> alignments were at the snp sites,
it served well as in silico validation of these snps, in addition
to and consistent with the rate  validated by sequencing and snapshot
assay.


CONCLUSIONS
high-quality est-snps from different citrus genotypes were detected, and
compared to estimate the heterozygosity of each genome. all the snp oligo
sequences were aligned with the clementine citrus genome to determine their
distribution and uniqueness and for in silico validation, in
addition to snapshot and sequencing validation of selected snps.
