BACKGROUND
a haplotype approach to genomic prediction using high density data in dairy cattle as an alternative to single-marker methods is presented. with the assumption that haplotypes are in stronger linkage disequilibrium  with quantitative trait loci  than single markers, this study focuses on the use of haplotype blocks  as explanatory variables for genomic prediction. haploblocks were built based on the ld between markers, which allowed variable reduction. the haploblocks were then used to predict three economically important traits  in the nordic holstein population.


RESULTS
the haploblock approach improved prediction accuracy compared with the commonly used individual single nucleotide polymorphism  approach. furthermore, using an average ld threshold to define the haploblocks  increased the prediction accuracies for all three traits, although the improvement was most significant for milk protein . hotelling’s t-tests were performed, confirming the improvement in prediction accuracy for milk protein. because the phenotypic values were in the form of de-regressed proofs, the improved accuracy for milk protein may be due to higher reliability of the data for this trait compared with the reliability of the mastitis and fertility data. comparisons between best linear unbiased prediction  and bayesian mixture models also indicated that the bayesian model produced the most accurate predictions in every scenario for the milk protein trait, and in some scenarios for fertility.


CONCLUSIONS
the haploblock approach to genomic prediction is a promising method for genomic selection in animal breeding. building haploblocks based on ld reduced the number of variables without the loss of information. this method may play an important role in the future genomic prediction involving while genome sequences.
