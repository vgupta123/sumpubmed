BACKGROUND
infectious laryngotracheitis virus  is an alphaherpesvirus that causes acute respiratory disease in chickens worldwide. to date, only one complete genomic sequence of iltv has been reported. this sequence was generated by concatenating partial sequences from six different iltv strains. thus, the full genomic sequence of a single  strain of iltv has not been determined previously. this study aimed to use high throughput sequencing technology to determine the complete genomic sequence of a live attenuated vaccine strain of iltv.


RESULTS
the complete genomic sequence of the serva vaccine strain of iltv was determined, annotated and compared to the concatenated iltv reference sequence. the genome size of the serva strain was  <dig>  bp, with a g + c content of 48%. a total of  <dig> predicted open reading frames were identified. the serva strain had  <dig> % dna sequence identity with the concatenated iltv sequence. notably, the concatenated iltv sequence was found to lack four large regions of sequence, including  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp of sequence in the ul <dig> and ul <dig> genes, respectively, and two copies of a  <dig>  bp sequence in the repeat regions. considerable differences in the size of the predicted translation products of  <dig> other genes  were also identified. more than  <dig> single-nucleotide polymorphisms  were identified. most snps were located within three genomic regions, corresponding to sequence from the sa- <dig> iltv vaccine strain in the concatenated iltv sequence.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first complete genomic sequence of an individual iltv strain. this sequence will facilitate future comparative genomic studies of iltv by providing an appropriate reference sequence for the sequence analysis of other iltv strains.
