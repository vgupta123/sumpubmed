BACKGROUND
the marine invertebrate starfish was found to contain a novel α-n-acetylgalactosaminidase, α-galnacase ii, which catalyzes removal of terminal α-n-acetylgalactosamine , in addition to a typical α-n-acetylgalactosaminidase, α-galnacase i, which catalyzes removal of terminal α-n-acetylgalactosamine  and, to a lesser extent, galactose. the interrelationship between α-galnacase i and α-galnacase ii and the molecular basis of their differences in substrate specificity remain unknown.


RESULTS
chemical and structural comparisons between α-galnacase i and ii using immunostaining, n-terminal amino acid sequencing and peptide analysis showed high homology to each other and also to other glycoside hydrolase family   <dig> members. the amino acid sequence of peptides showed conserved residues at the active site as seen in typical α-galnacase. some substitutions of conserved amino acid residues were found in α-galnacase ii that were located near catalytic site. among them g <dig> and a <dig>  in place of c <dig> and w <dig>  respectively in α-galnacase were identified to be responsible for lacking intrinsic α-galactosidase activity of α-galnacase ii. chemical modifications supported the presence of serine, aspartate and tryptophan as active site residues. two tryptophan residues  were involved in α-galactosidase activity, and one  of them was involved in α-galnacase activity.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggested that α-galnacase i and ii are closely related with respect to primary and higher order structure and that their structural differences are responsible for difference in substrate specificities.
