BACKGROUND
adoptive transfer of tumor infiltrating or circulating lymphocytes transduced with tumor antigen receptors has been examined in various clinical trials to treat human cancers. the tumor antigens targeted by transferred lymphocytes affects the efficacy of this therapeutic approach. because cancer stem cells  play an important role in tumor growth and metastasis, we hypothesized that adoptive transfer of t cells targeting a csc antigen could result in dramatic anti-tumor effects.


RESULTS
an epcam-specific chimeric antigen receptor  was constructed to transduce human peripheral blood lymphocytes  and thereby enable them to target the csc marker epcam. to investigate the therapeutic capabilities of pbls expressing epcam-specific cars, we used two different tumor models, pc <dig>  the human prostate cancer cell line, which has low expression levels of epcam, and pc3m, a highly metastatic clone of pc <dig> that has high expression levels of epcam. we demonstrate that car-expressing pbls can kill pc3m tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. despite the low expression of epcam on pc <dig> cells, car-expressing pbls significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged mouse survival in a pc <dig> metastasis model, probably by targeting the highly proliferative and metastatic population of cancer cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate that pbls expressing with epcam-specific cars have significant anti-tumor activity against prostate cancer. therefore, the adoptive transfer of t cells targeting epcam could have great potential as a cancer treatment.
