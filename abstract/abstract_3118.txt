BACKGROUND
sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor to treat gist and mrcc may interact with paracetamol as both undergo p <dig> mediated biotransformation and p-glycoprotein transport. this study evaluates the effects of sunitinib-paracetamol coadministration on liver and renal function biomarkers and liver, kidney, brain, heart and spleen histopathology. icr male mice  were administered saline  or paracetamol  <dig> mg/kg ip , or sunitinib at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> mg/kg po  or coadministered sunitinib at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> mg/kg po and paracetamol ip at fixed dose  <dig> mg/kg . paracetamol was administered  <dig> min before sunitinib. mice were sacrificed  <dig> h post sunitinib administration.


RESULTS
group-a serum alt and ast levels were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u/l and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u/l respectively and increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u/l and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u/l respectively in group-b; group-c alt and ast ranged  <dig> - <dig>  u/l and  <dig> - <dig>  u/l respectively. after paracetamol coadministration with low sunitinib doses , alt and ast concentrations ranged  <dig> - <dig>  u/l and  <dig> - <dig>  u/l respectively, lower than group-b. paracetamol coadministration with high sunitinib doses showed higher alt and ast values , p <  <dig> . hepatic histopathology showed vascular congestion in group-b; mild congestion in group-c . in group-d, at low doses of sunitinib, lesser damage than in group-b occurred but larger changes including congestion were observed at high sunitinib doses. bun levels were higher  for group-b  and group-d  compared to group-a  and group-c . creatinine remained unchanged. renal congestion and necrosis was lower in group-c than group-b but was higher in group-d . mild cardiotoxicity occurred in groups b, c and d. brain vascular congestion occurred at high doses of sunitinib administered alone or with paracetamol. hepatic and renal biomarkers correlated with histopathology signs.


CONCLUSIONS
paracetamol and sunitinib coadministration may lead to dose dependent outcomes exhibiting mild hepatoprotective effect or increased hepatotoxicity. sunitinib at high doses show renal, cardiac and brain toxicity. liver and renal function monitoring is recommended.
