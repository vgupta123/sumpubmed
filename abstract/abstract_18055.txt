BACKGROUND
co and ft orthologs, belonging to the bbx and pebp family, respectively, have important and conserved roles in the photoperiod regulation of flowering time in plants. soybean genome experienced at least three rounds of whole genome duplications , which resulted in multiple copies of about 75% of genes. subsequent subfunctionalization is the main fate for paralogous gene pairs during the evolutionary process.


RESULTS
the phylogenic relationships revealed that co orthologs were widespread in the plant kingdom while ft orthologs were present only in angiosperms. twenty-eight co homologous genes and twenty-four ft homologous genes were gained in the soybean genome. based on the collinear relationship, the soybean ancestral co ortholog experienced three wgd events, but only two paralogous gene pairs  survived in the modern soybean. the paralogous gene pairs, gmcol1/ <dig> or gmcol5/ <dig>  showed similar expression patterns in pair but different between pairs, indicating that they functionally diverged. gmftl <dig> to  <dig> were derived from the same ancestor prior to the whole genome triplication  event, and after the legume wgd event the ancestor diverged into two branches, gmftl3/5/ <dig> and gmftl1/2/4/ <dig>  gmftl <dig> were truncated in the n-terminus compared to other ft-lineage genes, but ubiquitously expressed. expressions of gmftl <dig> to  <dig> were higher in leaves at the flowering stage than that at the seedling stage. gmftl <dig> was expressed at the highest level in all tissues except roots at the seedling stage, and its circadian pattern was different from the other five ones. the transcript of gmftl <dig> was highly accumulated in seedling roots. the circadian rhythms of gmcol5/ <dig> and gmft1/2/4/5/ <dig> were synchronized in a day, demonstrating the complicate relationship of co-ft regulons in soybean leaves. over-expression of gmcol <dig> did not rescue the flowering phenotype of the arabidopsis co mutant. however, ectopic expression of gmcol <dig> did rescue the co mutant phenotype. all gmftl <dig> to  <dig> showed flower-promoting activities in arabidopsis.


CONCLUSIONS
after three recent rounds of whole genome duplications in the soybean, the paralogous genes of co-ft regulons showed subfunctionalization through expression divergence. then, only gmcol5/ <dig> kept flowering-promoting activities, while gmftl <dig> to  <dig> contributed to flowering control. additionally, gmcol5/ <dig> and gmft1/2/3/4/5/ <dig> showed similar circadian expression profiles. therefore, our results suggested that gmcol5/ <dig> and gmft1/2/3/4/5/ <dig> formed the complicate co-ft regulons in the photoperiod regulation of flowering time in soybean.
