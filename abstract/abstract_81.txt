BACKGROUND
dysregulation of apoptosis has been implicated in a range of diseases including tumors, neurodegenerative and autoimmine diseases, as well as allergic asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  in humans. although it has a different pathophysiology, delayed apoptosis of various inflammatory cells may play a pivotal role in the development of recurrent airway obstruction  in horses. reduction of inflammatory cell apoptosis or a dysregulation of this process could lead to chronic inflammation and tissue injury. therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the rate of apoptosis and necrosis of neutrophils and macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from seven horses suffering from rao  and seven control horses.


RESULTS
we demonstrated that neutrophil/macrophage apoptosis is altered in rao-affected horses compared with the control group in the bal fluid. we found a significant difference between the median percentage of early and late apoptosis of neutrophils between the study and control group of horses. moreover, we found a positive correlation between the rate of apoptosis and the median percentage of macrophages in rao-affected horses.


CONCLUSIONS
the findings suggest that apoptosis dysregulation may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of rao. however, further studies are needed to clarify the role of altered apoptosis in the course of equine recurrent airway obstruction.
