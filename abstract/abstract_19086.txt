BACKGROUND
when dna double-strand breaks  are induced by ionizing radiation  in cells, histone h2ax is quickly phosphorylated into γ-h2ax  around the dsb site. the necessity of dna-pkcs in regulating the phosphorylation of h2ax in response to dna damage and cell cycle progression was investigated.


RESULTS
the level of γh2ax in hela cells increased rapidly with a peak level at  <dig>  -  <dig>  h after  <dig> gy γ irradiation. sirna-mediated depression of dna-pkcs resulted in a strikingly decreased level of γh2ax. an increased γh2ax was also induced in the atm deficient cell line at5biva at  <dig>  -  <dig>  h after  <dig> gy γ rays, and this ir-increased γh2ax in atm deficient cells was dramatically abolished by the pikk inhibitor wortmannin and the dna-pkcs specific inhibitor nu <dig>  a high level of constitutive expression of γh2ax was observed in another atm deficient cell line ats <dig>  the alteration of γh2ax level associated with cell cycle progression was also observed. hela cells with sirna-depressed dna-pkcs  or normal level dna-pkcs  were synchronized at the g <dig> phase with the thymidine double-blocking method. at ~ <dig> h after the synchronized cells were released from the g <dig> block, the s phase cells were dominant  for both hela-h <dig> and hela-nc cells. at  <dig> -  <dig> h after the synchronized cells released from the g <dig> block, the proportion of g2/m population reached  <dig> - 60% for hela-nc cells, which was higher than that for hela h <dig> cells . consistently, the proportion of s phase for hela-nc cells decreased to ~15%; while a higher level  was still maintained for the dna-pkcs depleted hela-h <dig> cells during this period. in hela-nc cells, the γh2ax level increased gradually as the cells were released from the g <dig> block and entered the g2/m phase. however, this γh2ax alteration associated with cell cycle progressing was remarkably suppressed in the dna-pkcs depleted hela-h <dig> cells, while wortmannin and nu <dig> could also suppress this cell cycle related phosphorylation of h2ax. furthermore, inhibition of gsk3β activity with licl or specific sirna could up-regulate the γh2ax level and prolong the time of increased γh2ax to  <dig> h or more after  <dig> gy. gsk3β is a negative regulation target of dna-pkcs/akt signaling via phosphorylation on ser <dig>  which leads to its inactivation. depression of dna-pkcs in hela cells leads to a decreased phosphorylation of akt on ser <dig> and its target gsk3β on ser <dig>  which, in other words, results in an increased activation of gsk3β. in addition, inhibition of pdk  by sirna can also decrease the induction of γh2ax in response to both dna damage and cell cycle progression.


CONCLUSIONS
dna-pkcs plays a dominant role in regulating the phosphorylation of h2ax in response to both dna damage and cell cycle progression. it can directly phosphorylate h2ax independent of atm and indirectly modulate the phosphorylation level of γh2ax via the akt/gsk <dig> β signal pathway.
