BACKGROUND
pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum is a phytopathogenic enterobacterium responsible for soft rot, a disease characterized by extensive maceration of the affected plant tissue. this species also produces two or more antibacterial substances called bacteriocins, which enhance its competitiveness against related rival species. however, the secretion mechanism for low-molecular-weight bacteriocin is still unknown.


RESULTS
a mutant  that did not secrete the low-molecular-weight bacteriocin , carocin s <dig>  was generated by tn <dig> insertional mutagenesis. sequence analysis indicated that this insertion disrupted open reading frame  <dig>  and orf <dig> of this strain. deletion and rescue experiments indicated that orf <dig> and orf <dig> were both required for extracellular lmwb secretion. the orf <dig> and orf <dig> sequences showed high homology with the flhd and flhc gene sequences of pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. atroseptica, serratia marcescens, yersinia enterocolitica, and escherichia coli, indicating that they likely encoded key regulatory components of the type iii flagella secretion system.


CONCLUSIONS
thus, the extracellular export of carocin s <dig> by pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum appears to utilize the type iii secretion system integral to bacterial flagella.
