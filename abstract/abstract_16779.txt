BACKGROUND
α–glucosidase  plays a key role in hydrolyzing α-glucosidic linkages. in apis mellifera, three isoforms of hbgase  have been reported, which differ in their nucleotide composition, encoding amino acid sequences and enzyme kinetics. recombinant hbgase ii from a. cerana indica  was focused upon here due to the fact it is a native and economic honeybee species in thailand. the data is compared to the two other isoforms, acihbgase i and iii from the same bee species and to the three isoforms  in different bee species where available.


RESULTS
the highest transcript expression level of acihbgase ii was found in larvae and pupae, with lower levels in the eggs of a. cerana indica but it was not found in foragers. the full-length acihbgase ii cdna, and the predicted amino acid sequence it encodes were  <dig>  bp and  <dig> residues, respectively. the cdna sequence was 90% identical to that from the hbgase ii from the closely related a. cerana japonica . the full length cdna was directionally cloned into the ppiczαa expression vector in frame with a  <dig> encoding c terminal tag using ecori and kpni compatible ends, and transformed into pichia pastoris. maximal expression of the racihbgase ii– <dig> protein was induced by  <dig> %  methanol for  <dig> h and secreted into the culture media. the partially purified enzyme was found to have optimal α-glucosidase activity at ph  <dig>  and 45°c, with > 80% activity between ph  <dig> – <dig>  and 40–55°c, and was stabile  at ph 4– <dig> and at < 25–65°c. the optimal substrate was sucrose.


CONCLUSIONS
like in a. mellifera, there are three isoforms of acihbgase  that differ in their transcript expression pattern, nucleotide sequences and optimal enzyme conditions and kinetics.
