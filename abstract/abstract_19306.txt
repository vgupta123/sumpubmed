BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small, non-coding rnas of  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides that regulate gene expression and responses to biotic and abiotic stress. till now, no reports have previously been published concerning mirnas in celery.


RESULTS
two small rnas libraries were constructed from two celery varieties, ‘jinnan shiqin’ and ‘ventura’, and characterized by deep sequencing. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mirnas were identified in celery varieties ‘jinnan shiqin’ and ‘ventura’, respectively. potential mirna-target genes were predicted and annotated by screening diverse protein databases, including gene ontology, cluster of orthologous groups and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes. significant differential expression between the two varieties was seen for  <dig> mirnas. qrt-pcr was used to analyze the abundance of six mirnas under cold and heat stress conditions. the results showed that mirnas may have important functions in controlling temperature stress in celery.


CONCLUSIONS
a large number of mirnas were identified in celery, and their target genes, functional annotations, and gene expression patterns have been explored.

these findings provide the first information on celery mirnas and enhance understanding of celery mirna regulatory mechanisms under extreme temperature stress.
