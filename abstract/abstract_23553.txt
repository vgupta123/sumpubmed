BACKGROUND
opioid-induced immobilization is associated with severe respiratory depression in the white rhinoceros. we evaluated the efficacy of butorphanol and oxygen insufflation in alleviating opioid-induced respiratory depression in eight boma-managed rhinoceros.


RESULTS
chemical immobilization with etorphine, azaperone and hyaluronidase, as per standard procedure for the white rhinoceros, caused severe respiratory depression with hypoxaemia , hypercapnia  and acidosis  in the control trial at 5 min. compared to pre-intervention values, butorphanol administration  improved the pao <dig>  = <dig> , p < <dig> ), paco <dig>  = <dig> , p < <dig> ) and ph  = <dig> , p < <dig> ), while oxygen insufflation alone exacerbated the hypercapnia  = <dig> , p < <dig> ) and acidosis  = <dig> , p < <dig> ). surprisingly, butorphanol combined with oxygen fully corrected the opioid-induced hypoxaemia  and reduced the hypercapnia over the whole immobilization period  compared to the control trial. however, this intervention  did not have any effect on the arterial ph.


CONCLUSIONS
oxygen insufflation combined with a single intravenous dose of butorphanol improved the immobilization quality of boma-managed white rhinoceros by correcting the opioid-induced hypoxaemia, but did not completely reverse all components of respiratory depression. the efficacy of this intervention in reducing respiratory depression in field-captured animals remains to be determined.
