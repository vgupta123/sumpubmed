BACKGROUND
urease b is an important virulence factor that is required for helicobacter pylori to colonise the gastric mucosa. mouse monoclonal antibodies  that inhibit urease b enzymatic activity will be useful as vaccines for the prevention and treatment of h. pylori infection. here, we produced murine mabs against urease b that neutralize the enzyme's activity. we mapped their epitopes by phage display libraries and investigated the immunogenicity of the selected mimotopes in vivo.


RESULTS
the urease b gene was obtained  and the recombinant pgex-4t-1/ureaseb protein was expressed in escherichia coli as a 92-kda recombinant fusion protein with glutathione-s-transferase . five mabs u001-u <dig> were produced by a hybridoma-based technique with urease b-gst as an immunogen. only u <dig> could inhibit urease b enzymatic activity. immunoscreening via phage display libraries revealed two different mimotopes of urease b protein; exxxhdm from ph.d.12-library and exxxhsm from ph.d.c7c that matched the urease b proteins at 347- <dig> aa. the antiserum induced by selected phage clones clearly recognised the urease b protein and inhibited its enzymatic activity, which indicated that the phagotope-induced immune responses were antigen specific.


CONCLUSIONS
the present work demonstrated that phage-displayed mimotopes were accessible to the mouse immune system and triggered a humoral response. the urease b mimotope could provide a novel and promising approach for the development of a vaccine for the diagnosis and treatment of h. pylori infection.
