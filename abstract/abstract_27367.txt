BACKGROUND
γδ t cells differ from αβ t cells with regard to the types of antigen with which their t cell receptors interact; γδ t cell antigens are not necessarily peptides nor are they presented on mhc. cattle are considered a "γδ t cell high" species indicating they have an increased proportion of γδ t cells in circulation relative to that in "γδ t cell low" species such as humans and mice. prior to the onset of the studies described here, there was limited information regarding the genes that code for the t cell receptor delta chains of this γδ t cell high species.


RESULTS
by annotating the bovine  genome btau_ <dig>  assembly the presence of  <dig> distinct t cell receptor delta  variable  genes were found,  <dig> of which belong to the trdv <dig> subgroup and were co-mingled with the t cell receptor alpha variable  genes. in addition, two genes belonging to the trdv <dig> subgroup and single trdv <dig> and trdv <dig> genes were found. we confirmed the presence of five diversity  genes, three junctional  genes and a single constant  gene and describe the organization of the trd locus. the trdv <dig> gene is found downstream of the c gene and in an inverted orientation of transcription, consistent with its orthologs in humans and mice. cdna evidence was assessed to validate expression of the variable genes and showed that one to five d genes could be incorporated into a single transcript. finally, we grouped the bovine and ovine trdv <dig> genes into sets based on their relatedness.


CONCLUSIONS
the bovine genome contains a large and diverse repertoire of trd genes when compared to the genomes of "γδ t cell low" species. this suggests that in cattle γδ t cells play a more important role in immune function since they would be predicted to bind a greater variety of antigens.
