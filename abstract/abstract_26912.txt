BACKGROUND
detecting functional variants contributing to diversity of behaviour is crucial for dissecting genetics of complex behaviours. at a molecular level, characterisation of variation in exons has been studied as they are easily identified in the current genome annotation although the functional consequences are less well understood; however, it has been difficult to prioritise regions of non-coding dna in which genetic variation could also have significant functional consequences. comparison of multiple vertebrate genomes has allowed the identification of non-coding evolutionary conserved regions , in which the degree of conservation can be comparable with exonic regions suggesting functional significance.


RESULTS
we identified ecrs at the dopamine receptor d <dig> gene locus, an important gene for human behaviours. the most conserved non-coding ecr  supported high reporter gene expression in primary cultures derived from neonate rat frontal cortex. computer aided analysis of the sequence of the d4ecr <dig> indicated the potential transcription factors that could modulate its function. d4ecr <dig> contained multiple consensus sequences for binding the transcription factor sp <dig>  a factor previously implicated in drd <dig> expression. co-transfection experiments demonstrated that overexpression of sp <dig> significantly decreased the activity of the d4ecr <dig> in vitro.


CONCLUSIONS
bioinformatic analysis complemented by functional analysis of the drd <dig> gene locus has identified a) a strong enhancer that functions in neurons and b) a transcription factor that may modulate the function of that enhancer.
