BACKGROUND
endothelial progenitor cells  play a fundamental role in post-natal vascular repair, yet epcs from different anatomic locations possess unique biological properties. the underlying mechanisms are unclear.


RESULTS
epcs from cb expressed abundant genes involved in cell cycle, hypoxia signalling and blood vessel development, correlating with the phenotypes that cb-epcs proliferated more rapidly, migrated faster, and formed tubule structure more efficiently. smrna-seq further deciphered mirnome patterns in epcs isolated from cb or pb:  <dig> mirnas were enriched in cb-epcs, while another  <dig> in pb-epcs. specifically, cb-epcs expressed more angiogenic mirnas such as mir- <dig>  while pb-epcs possessed more tumor suppressive mirnas including mir-10a. knocking down mir- <dig> levels in cb-epcs suppressed cell migration and microtubule formation, while overexpressing mir- <dig> in pb-epcs helped to recapitulate some of cb-epc functions.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show the foundation for a more detailed understanding of epcs from different anatomic sources. stimulating the expression of angiogenic micrornas or genes in epcs of low activity  might allow the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
