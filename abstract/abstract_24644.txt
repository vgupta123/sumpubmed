BACKGROUND
control of foodborne pathogens is an important issue for the fruit juice industry and ohmic heating treatment has been considered as one of the promising antimicrobial interventions. however, to date, evaluation of the relationship between inactivation of foodborne pathogens and system performance efficiency based on differing soluble solids content of apple juice during ohmic heating treatment has not been well studied. this study aims to investigate effective voltage gradients of an ohmic heating system and corresponding sugar concentrations  of apple juice for inactivating major foodborne pathogens  while maintaining higher system performance efficiency.


RESULTS
voltage gradients of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 60 v/cm were applied to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> °brix apple juices. at all voltage levels, the lowest heating rate was observed in  <dig> °brix apple juice and a similar pattern of temperature increase was shown in18– <dig> °brix juice samples. system performance coefficients  under two treatment conditions  were relatively greater than for other combinations. meanwhile, 5-log reductions of the three foodborne pathogens were achieved after treatment for 60 s in  <dig> °brix at 30 v/cm, but this same reduction was observed in  <dig> °brix juice at 60 v/cm within 20 s without affecting product quality.


CONCLUSIONS
with respect to both bactericidal efficiency and spc values, 60 v/cm in  <dig> °brix was the most effective ohmic heating treatment combination for decontaminating apple juice concentrates.
