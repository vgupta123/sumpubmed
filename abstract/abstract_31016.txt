BACKGROUND
clinical appearance and evolution of canine leishmaniosis  are the consequence of complex interactions between the parasite and the genetic and immunological backgrounds. we investigated the effect of an immune-modulating diet in cl. dogs were treated with anti- leishmania pharmacological therapy combined with standard diet  or with the immune-modulating diet . cd3+ cd4+ foxp3+ regulatory t cells  and cd3+ cd4+ ifn-γ + t helper  <dig>  were analyzed by flow cytometry.


RESULTS
all sick dogs showed low platelet number at diagnosis . a platelet increase was observed after six months  sd group, with still remaining in the normal range at twelve months . immd group showed an increase in platelet number becoming similar to healthy dogs at t <dig> and t <dig>  an increase of cd4/cd <dig> ratio was revealed in sd group after three months , while at t <dig> and at t <dig> the values resembled to t <dig>  the increase in cd4/cd <dig> ratio at t <dig> was maintained at t <dig> and t <dig> in immd group.

a reduction in the percentage of treg of all sick dogs was observed at t <dig>  a recovery of treg percentage was observed only at t <dig> in sd group, while this effect disappeared at t <dig> and t <dig>  in contrast, treg percentage became similar to healthy animals in imdd group at t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  sick dogs showed an increase of th <dig> cells at t <dig> as compared with healthy dogs. we observed the occurrence of a decrease of th <dig> cells from t <dig> to t <dig> in sd group, although a trend of increase was observed at t <dig> and t <dig>  at variance, immd group dogs showed a progressive decrease of th <dig> cells, whose levels became similar to healthy controls at t <dig> and t <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the immune-modulating diet appears to regulate the immune response in cl during the standard pharmacological treatment. the presence of nutraceuticals in the diet correlates with the decrease of th <dig> cells and with the increase of treg in sick dogs. therefore, the administration of the specific dietary supplement improved the clinical response to the standard treatment in a model of cl.
