BACKGROUND
corylus was renowned for its production of hazelnut and taxol. to understand the local adaptation of chinese species and speed up breeding efforts in china, we analyzed the leaf transcriptome of corylus mandshurica, which had a high tolerance to fungal infections and cold.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> , <dig> clean pair-end reads were generated and then assembled into  <dig>  expressed sequence tag  sequences. during functional annotation,  <dig>  ests were annotated with gene ontology  terms using blast2go and  <dig>  ests were grouped into the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways using kegg automatic annotation server . we identified  <dig> ests that were homologous to enzymes and transcription factors responsible for taxol synthesis. the most differentiated orthologs between c. mandshurica and a european congener, c. avellana, were enriched in stress tolerance to fungal resistance and cold.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we detected a set of genes related to taxol synthesis in a taxol-producing angiosperm species for the first time and found a close relationship between most differentiated genes and different adaptations to fungal infection and cold in c. mandshurica and c. avellana. these findings provided tools to improve our understanding of local adaptation, genetic breeding and taxol production in hazelnut.
