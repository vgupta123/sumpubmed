BACKGROUND
the yeast xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous synthesizes astaxanthin, a carotenoid with high commercial interest. the proposed biosynthetic route in this organism is isopentenyl-pyrophosphate  → geranyleranyl pyrophosphate  → phytoene → lycopene → β-carotene → astaxanthin. recently, it has been published that the conversion of β-carotene into astaxanthin requires only one enzyme, astaxanthin synthase or crts, encoded by crts gene. this enzyme belongs to the cytochrome p <dig> protein family.


RESULTS
in this work, a crtr gene was isolated from x. dendrorhous yeast, which encodes a cytochrome p <dig> reductase  that provides crts with the necessary electrons for substrate oxygenation. we determined the structural organization of the crtr gene and its location in the yeast electrophoretic karyotype. two transformants, cbstr and t <dig>  were obtained by deleting the crtr gene and inserting a hygromycin b resistance cassette. the carotenoid composition of the transformants was altered in relation to the wild type strain. cbstr forms yellow colonies because it is unable to produce astaxanthin, hence accumulating β-carotene. t <dig> forms pale colonies because its astaxanthin content is reduced and its β-carotene content is increased.


CONCLUSIONS
in addition to the crts gene, x. dendrorhous requires a novel gene, crtr, for the conversion of β-carotene to astaxanthin.
