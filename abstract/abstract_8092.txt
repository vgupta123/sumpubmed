BACKGROUND
tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders with accumulation of three-repeat  or four-repeat  tau. while 3r tau is found in pick’s disease and alzheimer’s disease , 4r tau is more abundant in corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and ad. we have previously shown that cerebrolysin™ , a neuropeptide mixture with neurotrophic effects, ameliorates the pathology in amyloid precursor protein transgenic  mouse model of ad and 4r tau, however it is unclear if cbl ameliorates the deficits and neuropathology in the mouse model of pick’s disease over expressing 3r tau.


RESULTS
mice expressing 3r tau  under the mthy- <dig> promoter were treated with cbl in two separate groups, the first was 3 months old  and the second was 6 months old  at the start of the treatment. we found that although the levels of total 3r tau were unchanged, cbl reduced the levels of hyper-phosphorylated tau in both groups of mice. this was accompanied by reduced neurodegenerative pathology in the neocortex and hippocampus in both groups and by improvements in the behavioral deficits in the nest-building test and water maze in the 3–6 month group.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together these results support the notion that cbl may be beneficial in other taupathy models by reducing the levels of aberrantly phosphorylated tau.
