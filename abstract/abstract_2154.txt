BACKGROUND
improving fiber quality is a major challenge in cotton breeding, since the molecular basis of fiber quality traits is poorly understood. fine mapping and candidate gene prediction of quantitative trait loci  controlling cotton fiber quality traits can help to elucidate the molecular basis of fiber quality. in our previous studies, one major qtl controlling multiple fiber quality traits was identified near the t <dig> locus on chromosome  <dig> in upland cotton.


RESULTS
to finely map this major qtl, the f <dig> population with  <dig> individuals was established from a cross between yumian  <dig> and a recombinant inbred line  selected from a recombinant inbred line population . the qtl was mapped to a  <dig> -cm interval between markers hau <dig> and swu <dig>  the qtl explained  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  of phenotypic variation with additive effects of  <dig> , − <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  units for fiber length, micronaire, strength and uniformity, respectively. the qtl region corresponded to a  <dig> -mb interval on chromosome  <dig> in the g. raimondii genome sequence and a  <dig> -mb interval on chromosome a <dig> in g. hirsutum. the fiber of yumian  <dig> was much longer than that of ril <dig> from  <dig> dpa to  <dig> dpa. rna-seq of ovules at  <dig> dpa and fibers at  <dig> dpa from yumian  <dig> and ril <dig> showed four genes in the qtl region of the g. raimondii genome to be extremely differentially expressed. rt-pcr analysis showed three genes in the qtl region of the g. hirsutum genome to behave similarly.


CONCLUSIONS
this study mapped a major qtl influencing four fiber quality traits to a  <dig> -cm interval and identified three candidate genes by rna-seq and rt-pcr analysis. integration of fine mapping and rna-seq is a powerful strategy to uncover candidates for qtl in large genomes.
