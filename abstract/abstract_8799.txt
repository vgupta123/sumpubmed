BACKGROUND
innate immunity and tissue proliferation play important roles in otitis media , the most common disease of childhood. cjun terminal kinase  is potentially involved in both processes.


RESULTS
genes involved in both innate immune and growth factor activation of jnk are upregulated during om, while expression of both positive and negative jnk regulatory genes is altered. when compared to wildtypes , c57bl/ <dig> mice deficient in jnk <dig> exhibit enhanced mucosal thickening, with delayed recovery, enhanced neutrophil recruitment early in om, and delayed bacterial clearance. in contrast, jnk2−/− mice exhibit delayed mucosal hyperplasia that eventually exceeds that of wts and is slow to recover, delayed recruitment of neutrophils, and failure of bacterial clearance.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that jnk <dig> and jnk <dig> play primarily opposing roles in mucosal hyperplasia and neutrophil recruitment early in om. however, both isoforms are required for the normal resolution of middle ear infection.
