BACKGROUND
fetuin-a/ahsh is a novel hepatokine that acts as a vascular calcification inhibitor and as an endogenous tlr- <dig> ligand. fetuin-a may act as a positive or negative acute phase protein  in disease conditions. the relationship between circulatory fetuin-a and inflammatory biomarkers in type- <dig> diabetes  remains controversial. therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the plasma fetuin-a levels in  <dig> t2d  and  <dig> non-diabetic individuals  using premixed 38-plex map human cytokine/chemokine magnetic bead immunoassays and the data  were statistically analyzed to determine pearson’s correlation  between fetuin-a and detected analytes; p-values ≤ <dig>  were considered significant.


RESULTS
the data show that plasma fetuin-a levels were comparable in both groups  and in t2d individuals, fetuin-a associated negatively  with a large number of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and activation biomarkers including tnf-α, ifn-α <dig>  ifn-γ, il-1α, il-1β, il-1ra, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il-12p40/p <dig>  il- <dig>  ccl- <dig>  ccl- <dig>  ccl- <dig>  ccl- <dig>  cxcl- <dig>  cx3cl- <dig>  eff- <dig>  egf, g-csf, gm-csf, gro, scd40l, and vegf. in non-diabetics, fetuin-a also correlated positively with certain th <dig> cytokines  and chemokines . notably, in vitro fetuin-a production was significantly suppressed in hepg <dig> cells treated with tnf-α, il-1β, and ifn-γ which supported the clinical findings of a negative association between fetuin a and inflammatory mediators.


CONCLUSIONS
the negative association between circulatory fetuin-a and systemic inflammatory mediators in t2d patients suggests that plasma fetuin-a may have predictive significance as a negative app in metabolic disease.
