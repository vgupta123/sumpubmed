BACKGROUND
several global transcriptomic and proteomic approaches have been applied in order to obtain new molecular insights on skeletal myogenesis, but none has generated any specific data on glycogenome expression, and thus on the role of glycan structures in this process, despite the involvement of glycoconjugates in various biological events including differentiation and development. in the present study, a quantitative real-time rt-pcr technology was used to profile the dynamic expression of  <dig> glycogenes during the differentiation of c2c <dig> myoblasts into myotubes.


RESULTS
of the  <dig> genes expressed,  <dig> exhibited altered mrna expression when c2c <dig> cells differentiated and  <dig> displayed more than 4-fold up- or down-regulations. principal component analysis and hierarchical component analysis of the expression dynamics identified three groups of coordinately and sequentially regulated genes. the first group included  <dig> down-regulated genes, the second group four genes with an expression peak at  <dig> h of differentiation, and the last  <dig> up-regulated genes. these genes mainly encode cell adhesion molecules and key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans and glycolipids , providing a clearer indication of how the plasma membrane and extracellular matrix may be modified prior to cell fusion. in particular, an increase in the quantity of ganglioside gm <dig> at the cell surface of myoblasts is suggestive of its potential role during the initial steps of myogenic differentiation.


CONCLUSIONS
for the first time, these results provide a broad description of the expression dynamics of glycogenes during c2c <dig> differentiation. among the  <dig> highly deregulated glycogenes,  <dig> had never been associated with myogenesis. their biological functions suggest new roles for glycans in skeletal myogenesis.
