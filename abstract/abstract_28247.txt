BACKGROUND
most human endogenous retroviruses  invaded our genome at least  <dig> million years ago. the majority of the viral genes are degenerated, since no selection preserves them within the genome. however, a few intact and very old herv genes exist, and likely are beneficial for the host. we here address evolutionary aspects of two herv-v envelope genes, envv <dig> and envv <dig>  located in tandem and containing a long open reading frame.


RESULTS
the envv <dig> gene is preserved with an intact reading frame during simian evolution, but none of the envv genes are found in the prosimian species tested. while we observe many transposon insertions in the gag and pol regions of the erv-v <dig> provirus, the envv <dig> genes have escaped transposon crossfire in all species tested. additional analysis of nucleotide substitutions provides further strong evidence of purifying selection on the envv <dig> gene during primate evolution. the other copy, envv <dig>  seems to be involved in gene conversion of the major part of the envelope. furthermore, envv <dig> and envv <dig> show placenta-specific expression in human and a baboon species.


CONCLUSIONS
our analyses show that erv-v entered our genome after the split between simian and prosimian primates. subsequent purifying selection and gene conversion have preserved two copies of the envv envelope gene in most species. this is the first case of gene conversion involving long open reading frames in hervs. together with the placenta-specific expression of the human and baboon envv <dig> and envv <dig> envelope genes, these data provide strong evidence of a beneficial role for the host.
