BACKGROUND
the ability of cytosine deaminase  to convert the antifungal agent 5-fluorocytosine  into one of the most potent and largely used anticancer compound such as 5-fluorouracil  raised considerable interest in this enzyme to model gene or antibody â€“ directed enzyme-prodrug therapy  aiming to improve the therapeutic ratio  of cancer chemotherapy. the selection and characterization of a human monoclonal antibody in single chain fragment  format represents a powerful reagent to allow in in vitro and in vivo detection of cd expression in gdept/adept studies.


RESULTS
an enzymatic active recombinant cd from yeast  was expressed in e. coli system and used as antigen for biopanning approach of the large semi-synthetic eth- <dig> antibody phage library. several scfvs were isolated and specificity towards ycd was confirmed by western blot and elisa. further, biochemical and functional investigations demonstrated that the binding of specific scfv with ycd did not interfere with the activity of the enzyme in converting 5-fc into 5-fu.


CONCLUSIONS
the construction of libraries of recombinant antibody fragments that are displayed on the surface of filamentous phage, and the selection of phage antibodies against target antigens, have become an important biotechnological tool in generating new monoclonal antibodies for research and clinical applications. the scfvh <dig> generated by this method is the first human antibody which is able to detect ycd in routinary laboratory techniques without interfering with its enzymatic function.
