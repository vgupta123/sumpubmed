BACKGROUND
scar/wave proteins couple signalling to actin polymerization, and are thus fundamental to the formation of pseudopods and lamellipods. they are controlled as part of a five-membered complex that includes the tiny hspc <dig> protein. it is not known why scar/wave is found in such a large assembly, but in dictyostelium the four larger subunits have different, clearly delineated functions.


RESULTS
we have generated dictyostelium mutants in which the hspc <dig> gene is disrupted. as has been seen in other regulatory complex mutants, scar is lost in these cells, apparently by a post-translational mechanism, though pir <dig> levels do not change. hspc <dig> knockouts resemble scar mutants in slow migration, roundness, and lack of large pseudopods. however hspc300-colonies on bacteria are larger and more similar to wild type, suggesting that some scar function can survive without hspc <dig>  we find no evidence for functions of hspc <dig> outside the scar complex.


CONCLUSIONS
hspc <dig> is essential for most scar complex functions. the phenotype of hspc <dig> knockouts is most similar to mutants in scar, not the other members of the scar complex, suggesting that hspc <dig> acts most directly on scar itself.
