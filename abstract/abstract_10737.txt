BACKGROUND
bupivacaine-induced neurotoxicity has been shown to occur through apoptosis. recently, bupivacaine was shown to elicit reactive oxygen species  production and induce apoptosis accompanied by activation of p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase  in a human neuroblastoma cell line. we have reported that wdr <dig>  a wd40-repeat protein, may mediate apoptosis through caspase- <dig> activation. the present study was undertaken to test whether bupivacaine induces apoptosis in mouse neuroblastoma neuro2a cells and to determine whether ros, p <dig> mapk, and wdr <dig> are involved.


RESULTS
our results showed that bupivacaine induced ros generation and p <dig> mapk activation in neuro2a cells, resulting in apoptosis. bupivacaine also increased wdr <dig> expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. hydrogen peroxide  also increased wdr <dig> expression in neuro2a cells. antioxidant  and p <dig> mapk inhibitor  treatment attenuated the increase in caspase- <dig> activity, cell death and wdr <dig> expression induced by bupivacaine or h2o <dig>  although transfection of neuro2a cells with wdr <dig> sirna attenuated the bupivacaine- or h2o2-induced increase in expression of wdr <dig> mrna and protein, in contrast to our previous studies, it did not inhibit the increase in caspase- <dig> activity in bupivacaine- or h2o2-treated cells.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results indicated that bupivacaine induced apoptosis in neuro2a cells. bupivacaine induced ros generation and p <dig> mapk activation, resulting in an increase in wdr <dig> expression, in these cells. however, the increase in wdr <dig> expression may not be essential for the bupivacaine-induced apoptosis in neuro2a cells. these results may suggest the existence of another mechanism of bupivacaine-induced apoptosis independent from wdr <dig> expression in neuro2a cells.
