BACKGROUND
probiotics have shown favourable properties in maintaining oral health. by interacting with oral microbial communities, these species could contribute to healthier microbial equilibrium. this study aimed to investigate in vitro the ability of probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg  to integrate in oral biofilm and affect its species composition. five oral strains, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and candida albicans were involved. the group setup included  <dig> mono-species groups,  <dig> dual-species groups , and  <dig> multi-species groups . cell suspensions of six strains were pooled according to the group setup. biofilms were grown on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite  discs at 37 °c in anaerobic conditions for  <dig>  h. biofilm medium was added and refreshed at  <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig>  h. the ph of spent media was measured. viable cells of the  <dig>  h and  <dig>  h biofilms were counted.  <dig>  h biofilms were stained and scanned with confocal laser scanning microscopy.


RESULTS
our results showed that l.gg and s. mutans demonstrated stronger adhesion ability than the other strains to saliva-coated ha discs. l.gg, c. albicans, s. mutans and f. nucleatum, with poor ability to grow in mono-species biofilms demonstrated better abilities of adhesion and reproduction in dual- and/or multi-species biofilms. l.gg slightly suppressed the growth of c. albicans in all groups, markedly weakened the growth of s. sanguinis and f. nucleatum in 4sp + l.gg group, and slightly reduced the adhesion of s. mutans in l.gg+ s. mutans group.


CONCLUSIONS
to conclude, in this in vitro model l.gg successfully integrated in all oral biofilms, and reduced the counts of s. sanguinis and c. albicans and lowered the biofilm-forming ability of f. nucleatum, but only slightly reduced the adhesion of s. mutans. c. albicans significantly promoted the growth of l.gg.
