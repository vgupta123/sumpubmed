BACKGROUND
epigenetic regulation is known to affect gene expression, and recent research shows that aberrant dna methylation patterning and histone modifications may play a role in leukemogenesis. in order to highlight the co-operation of epigenetic mechanisms acting during the latter process it is important to clarify their potential as biomarkers of granulocytic differentiation.


RESULTS
in this study we investigated epigenetic alterations in human hematopoietic cells at a distinct differentiation stages: primary hematopoietic cd34+ cells, kg <dig> myeloid leukemic cells, whose development is stopped at early stage of differentiation, and mature neutrophils. we focused on the epigenetic status of cell cycle regulating  and differentiation related  genes. we found that the methylation level in promoter regions of some of these genes was considerably higher in kg <dig> cells and lower in cd34+ cells and human neutrophils. as examined and evaluated by computer-assisted methods, histone h <dig> and h <dig> modifications, i.e. h3k4me <dig>  h3k9ac, h3k9ac/s10ph and h <dig> hyperac, were similar in cd34+ cells and human mature neutrophils. by contrast, in the kg <dig> cells, histone h <dig> and h <dig> modifications were quite high and increased after induction of granulocytic differentiation with the hdac inhibitor phenyl butyrate.


CONCLUSIONS
we found the methylation status of the examined gene promoters and histone modifications to be characteristically associated with the hematopoietic cell progenitor state, induced to differentiate myeloid kg <dig> cells and normal blood neutrophils. this could be achieved through epigenetic regulation of e-cadherin, p <dig>  p <dig> and rarÎ² genes expression caused by dna methylation/demethylation, core and linker histones distribution in stem hematopoietic cells, induced to differentiation kg <dig> cells and mature human neutrophils, as well as the histone modifications h3k4me <dig>  h3k9ac, h3k9ac/s10ph and h <dig> hyperac in relation to hematopoietic cell differentiation to granulocyte. these findings also suggest them as potentially important biomarkers of hematopoietic cell granulocytic differentiation and could be valuable for leukemia induced differentiation therapy.
