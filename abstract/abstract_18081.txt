BACKGROUND
whole-genome sequencing projects are rapidly producing an enormous number of new sequences. consequently almost every family of proteins now contains hundreds of members. it has thus become necessary to develop tools, which classify protein sequences automatically and also quickly and reliably. the difficulty of this task is intimately linked to the mechanism by which protein sequences diverge, i.e. by simultaneous residue substitutions, insertions and/or deletions and whole domain reorganisations .


RESULTS
here we present a novel approach, which is based on random sampling of sub-sequences  out of a set of input sequences. the probes are compared to the input sequences, after a normalisation step; the results are used to partition the input sequences into homogeneous groups of proteins. in addition, this method provides information on diagnostic parts of the proteins. the performance of this method is challenged by two data sets. the first one contains the sequences of prokaryotic lyases that could be arranged as a multiple sequence alignment. the second one contains all proteins from swiss-prot release  <dig> with at least one src homology  <dig>  domain â€“ a classical example for proteins with modular architecture.


CONCLUSIONS
the outcome of our method is robust, highly reproducible as shown using bootstrap and resampling validation procedures. the results are essentially coherent with the biology. this method depends solely on well-established publicly available software and algorithms.
