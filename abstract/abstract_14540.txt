BACKGROUND
sharka is caused by plum pox virus  in stone fruit trees. in orchards, the virus is transmitted by aphids and by grafting. in arabidopsis, ppv is transferred by mechanical inoculation, by biolistics and by agroinoculation with infectious cdna clones. partial resistance to ppv has been observed in the cvi- <dig> and col- <dig> arabidopsis accessions and is characterized by a tendency to escape systemic infection. indeed, only one third of the plants are infected following inoculation, in comparison with the susceptible ler accession.


RESULTS
genetic analysis showed this partial resistance to be monogenic or digenic depending on the allelic configuration and recessive. it is detected when inoculating mechanically but is overcome when using biolistic or agroinoculation. a genome-wide association analysis was performed using multiparental lines and  <dig> arabidopsis accessions. it identified a major genomic region, rpv <dig>  fine mapping led to the positioning of rpv <dig> to a 200 kb interval on the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  a candidate gene approach identified the chloroplast phosphoglycerate kinase  as a potential gene underlying the resistance. a virus-induced gene silencing strategy was used to knock-down cpgk <dig> expression, resulting in drastically reduced ppv accumulation.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that rpv <dig> resistance to ppv carried by the cvi- <dig> and col- <dig> accessions is linked to allelic variations at the arabidopsis cpgk <dig> locus, leading to incomplete, compatible interaction with the virus.
