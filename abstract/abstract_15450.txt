BACKGROUND
this study was aimed at evaluating the clinical protection, the level of porcine circovirus type  <dig>  viremia and the immune response ) in piglets derived from pcv <dig> vaccinated sows and themselves vaccinated against pcv <dig> at different age, namely at  <dig>   <dig> and 8 weeks. the cohort study has been carried out over three subsequent production cycles . at the start/enrolment,  <dig> gilts were considered at first mating, bled and vaccinated. at the first, second and third farrowing, dams were bled and re-vaccinated at the subsequent mating after weaning piglets. overall  <dig> piglets at each farrowing  were randomly allocated in three different groups  based on the timing of vaccination . a fourth group was kept non-vaccinated . piglets were vaccinated intramuscularly with one dose  of a commercial pcv2a-based subunit vaccine . twenty animals per group were bled at weaning and from vaccination to slaughter every 4 weeks for the detection of pcv <dig> viremia, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. clinical signs and individual treatments , mortality, and body weight of all piglets were recorded.


RESULTS
all vaccination schemes  were able to induce an antibody response and ifn-γ sc. the highest clinical and virological protection sustained by immune reactivity was observed in pigs vaccinated at 6 weeks of age. overall, repeated pcv <dig> vaccination in sows at mating and the subsequent higher levels of maternally derived antibodies did not significantly interfere with the induction of both humoral and cell-mediated immunity in their piglets after vaccination.


CONCLUSIONS
the combination of vaccination in sows at mating and in piglets at 6 weeks of age was more effective for controlling pcv <dig> natural infection, than other vaccination schemas, thus sustaining that some interference of mda with the induction of an efficient immune response could be considered. in conclusion, optimal vaccination strategy needs to balance the levels of passive immunity, the management practices and timing of infection.
