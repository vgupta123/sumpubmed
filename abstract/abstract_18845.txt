BACKGROUND
local anesthetics are an important component of perioperative pain management, but the duration of action of available products is limited. we hypothesized that a single local infiltration of a novel bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension  would provide clinically effective analgesia over a 72-h period.

in a masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center pilot field study, dogs undergoing lateral retinacular suture placement for cranial cruciate insufficiency were randomly assigned to surgical site infiltration with at- <dig>  or an equivalent volume of saline. infiltration of the surgical site was done prior to closure. primary outcome measure was the glasgow composite measure pain scale  assessed prior to surgery and at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 72 h following surgery by trained individuals. provision for rescue analgesia was employed. repeated measures analysis of variance were utilized to test for possible differences between treatment groups and a success/failure analysis was also employed, based on the need for rescue analgesia.


RESULTS
forty-six dogs were enrolled and evaluated. for cmps-sf scores there was a significant overall treatment effect  in favor of at- <dig>  there were significantly more successes in the at- <dig> group compared to placebo over each time period . no significant adverse events were seen.


CONCLUSIONS
at- <dig>  provided measurable local analgesia over a 72-h period following post-stifle surgery surgical site tissue infiltration. further work is indicated to develop this product for clinical use.
