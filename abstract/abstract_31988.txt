BACKGROUND
physarales represents the largest taxonomic order among the plasmodial slime molds . physarales is of particular interest since the two best-studied myxomycete species, physarum polycephalum and didymium iridis, belong to this order and are currently subjected to whole genome and transcriptome analyses. here we report molecular phylogeny based on ribosomal dna  sequences that includes  <dig> physarales isolates.


RESULTS
the physarales nuclear rdna sequences were found to be loaded with  <dig> autocatalytic group i introns, which may complicate correct alignments and subsequent phylogenetic tree constructions. phylogenetic analysis of rdna sequences depleted of introns confirmed monophyly of the physarales families didymiaceae and physaraceae. whereas good correlation was noted between phylogeny and taxonomy among the didymiaceae isolates, significant deviations were seen in physaraceae. the largest genus, physarum, was found to be polyphyletic consisting of at least three well supported clades. a synapomorphy, located at the highly conserved g-binding site of l <dig> group i intron ribozymes further supported the physarum clades.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide molecular relationship of physarales genera, species, and isolates. this information is important in further interpretations of comparative genomics nd transcriptomics. in addition, the result supports a polyphyletic origin of the genus physarum and calls for a reevaluation of current taxonomy.
