BACKGROUND
polyandry is commonly maintained by direct benefits in gift-giving species, so females may remate as an adaptive foraging strategy. however, the assumption of a direct benefit fades in mating systems where male gift-giving behaviour has evolved from offering nutritive to worthless  items. in the spider paratrechalea ornata, 70% of gifts in nature are worthless. we therefore predicted female receptivity to be independent of hunger in this species. we exposed poorly-fed and well-fed females to multiple males offering nutritive gifts and well-fed females to males offering worthless gifts.


RESULTS
though the treatments strongly affected fecundity, females of all groups had similar number of matings. this confirms that female receptivity is independent of their nutritional state, i.e. polyandry does not prevail as a foraging strategy.


CONCLUSIONS
in the spider pisaura mirabilis, in which the majority  of gifts in nature are nutritive, female receptivity depends on hunger. we therefore propose that the dependence of female receptivity on hunger state may have evolved in species with predominantly nutritive gifts but is absent in species with predominantly worthless gifts.
