BACKGROUND
tor, the target of the antibiotic rapamycin in both yeast and mammalian cells, is a potent cell growth regulator in all eukaryotes. it acts through the phosphorylation of downstream effectors that are recruited to it by the binding partner raptor. in arabidopsis, raptor activity is essential for postembryonic growth. though comparative studies suggest potential downstream effectors, no raptor binding partners have been described in plants.


RESULTS
atraptor1b, a plant raptor homologue, binds the aml <dig>  protein in a yeast two-hybrid assay. this interaction is mediated by the n-terminal  <dig> residues of aml <dig>  and marks aml <dig> as a candidate attor kinase substrate in plants. the aml <dig> n-terminus additionally carries transcriptional activation domain activity. plants homozygous for insertion alleles at the aml <dig> locus, as well as plants homozygous for insertion alleles at all five loci in the aml gene family, bolt earlier than wild-type plants.


CONCLUSIONS
aml <dig> interacts with atraptor1b, homologue of a protein that recruits substrates for phosphorylation by the major cell-growth regulator tor. identification of aml <dig> as a putative downstream effector of tor gives valuable insights into the plant-specific mode of action of this critical growth regulator.
