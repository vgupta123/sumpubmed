BACKGROUND
the gencode project has collected over  <dig>  human long non-coding rna  genes. however, the vast majority of them remain to be functionally characterized. computational investigation of potential functions of human lncrna genes is helpful to guide further experimental studies on lncrnas.


RESULTS
in this study, based on expression correlation between lncrnas and protein-coding genes across  <dig> human normal tissues, we used the hypergeometric test to functionally annotate a single lncrna or a set of lncrnas with significantly enriched functional terms among the protein-coding genes that are significantly co-expressed with the lncrna. the functional terms include all nodes in the gene ontology  and  <dig>  human biological pathways collected from  <dig> pathway databases. we successfully mapped  <dig>  human lncrna genes to go terms and biological pathways, and then developed the first ontology-driven user-friendly web interface named lncrna2function, which enables researchers to browse the lncrnas associated with a specific functional term, the functional terms associated with a specific lncrna, or to assign functional terms to a set of human lncrna genes, such as a cluster of co-expressed lncrnas. the lncrna2function is freely available at http://mlg.hit.edu.cn/lncrna2function.


CONCLUSIONS
the lncrna2function is an important resource for further investigating the functions of a single human lncrna, or functionally annotating a set of human lncrnas of interest.
