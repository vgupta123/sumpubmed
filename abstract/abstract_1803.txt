BACKGROUND
vitamin a and its derivatives, the retinoids, are essential for normal embryonic development and maintenance of cell differentiation. β, β-carotene  <dig> '-monooxygenase  <dig>  catalyzes the central cleavage of β-carotene to all-trans retinal and is the key enzyme in the intestinal metabolism of carotenes to vitamin a. however, human and various rodent species show markedly different efficiencies in intestinal bcmo1-mediated carotene to retinoid conversion. the aim of this study is to identify potentially human-specific regulatory control mechanisms of bcmo <dig> gene expression.


RESULTS
we identified and functionally characterized the human bcmo <dig> promoter sequence and determined the transcriptional regulation of the bcmo <dig> gene in a bcmo <dig> expressing human intestinal cell line, tc- <dig>  several functional transcription factor-binding sites were identified in the human promoter that are absent in the mouse bcmo <dig> promoter. we demonstrate that the proximal promoter sequence, nt - <dig> to + <dig>  confers basal transcriptional activity of the human bcmo <dig> gene. site-directed mutagenesis of the myocyte enhancer factor  <dig>  and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  binding elements resulted in decreased basal promoter activity. mutation of both promoter elements abrogated the expression of intestinal cell bcmo <dig>  electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays and transcription factor co-expression in tc- <dig> cells showed mef2c and pparγ bind to their respective dna elements and synergistically transactivate bcmo <dig> expression.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that human intestinal cell bcmo <dig> expression is dependent on the functional cooperation between pparγ and mef <dig> isoforms. the findings suggest that the interaction between mef <dig> and ppar factors may provide a molecular basis for interspecies differences in the transcriptional regulation of the bcmo <dig> gene.
