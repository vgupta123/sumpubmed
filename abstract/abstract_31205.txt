BACKGROUND
the zoonotic agent toxoplasma gondii is distributed world-wide, and can infect a broad range of hosts including humans. microneme protein  <dig> of t. gondii  is responsible for binding to aldolase, and is associated with rhomboid cleavage and presence of trafficking signals during invasion. however, little is known of the tgmic <dig> sequence diversity among t. gondii isolates from different hosts and geographical locations.


RESULTS
in this study, we examined sequence variation in mic <dig> gene among t. gondii isolates from different hosts and geographical regions. the entire genomic region of the mic <dig> gene was amplified and sequenced, and phylogenetic relationship was reconstructed using bayesian inference  and maximum parsimony  based on the mic <dig> gene sequences. the results of sequence alignments showed two lengths of the sequence of mic <dig> gene among all the examined 12 t. gondii strains: 4391 bp for strains tgcatbr <dig> and mas, and 4394 bp for strains rh, tgplh, gt <dig>  pru, qho, ptg, pys, gjs, ctg and tgtoucan. their a+t content ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %. a total of  <dig> variable nucleotide positions  were identified, including  <dig> variations in  <dig> exons and  <dig> variations in  <dig> introns. phylogenetic analysis of mic <dig> sequences showed that typical genotypes  were able to be grouped into their respective genotypes. moreover, the three major clonal lineages  can be differentiated by pcr-rflp using restriction enzyme pst i.


CONCLUSIONS
phylogenetic analysis and pcr-rflp of the mic <dig> locus among t. gondii isolates from different hosts and geographical regions allowed the differentiation of three major clonal lineages  into their respective genotypes, suggesting that mic <dig> gene may provide a novel potential genetic marker for population genetic studies of t. gondii isolates.
