BACKGROUND
bovine milk fat composition is responsive to dietary manipulation providing an avenue to modify the content of fatty acids and especially some specific unsaturated fatty acid  isomers of benefit to human health. micrornas  regulate gene expression but their specific roles in bovine mammary gland lipogenesis are unclear. the objective of this study was to determine the expression pattern of mirnas following mammary gland adaptation to dietary supplementation with 5 % linseed or safflower oil using next generation rna-sequencing.

methods
twenty-four canadian holstein dairy cows  in mid lactation were fed a control diet  for 28 days followed by a treatment period  of 28 days. milk samples were collected weekly for fat and individual fatty acid determination. rna from mammary gland biopsies harvested on day- <dig>  and on days + <dig> and + <dig>  from six randomly selected cows per treatment was subjected to small rna sequencing.


RESULTS
milk fat percentage decreased significantly  during treatment with the two diets as compared to the control period. the individual saturated fatty acids c4: <dig>  c6: <dig>  c8: <dig>  c14: <dig> and c16: <dig> decreased significantly  while five usfas  increased remarkably  in response to both treatments. analysis of  <dig> million sequence reads generated  <dig> known bovine mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas. the expression of fourteen and twenty-two mirnas was affected  by linseed and safflower oil treatments, respectively. seven mirnas including six up-regulated  and one down-regulated  were found to be regulated  by both treatments, and thus considered core differentially expressed  mirnas. the gene targets of core de mirnas have functions related to gene expression and general cellular metabolism  and are enriched in four pathways of lipid metabolism .


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that de mirnas in this study might be important regulators of bovine mammary lipogenesis and metabolism. the novel mirnas identified in this study will further enrich the bovine mirnome repertoire and contribute to understanding mammary gland biology.
