BACKGROUND
pax <dig> is a transcription factor essential for normal development of the eyes and nervous system. it has two major isoforms, pax <dig> and pax <dig>  and the ratios between their expression levels vary within narrow limits. we tested the effects of overexpressing either one or other isoform on endogenous pax <dig> expression levels in neuro2a and nih3t <dig> cells.


RESULTS
we found that both isoforms caused an up-regulation of endogenous pax <dig> expression in cells with  or without  constitutive pax <dig> expression. western blots showed that cells stably transfected with constructs expressing either pax <dig> or pax <dig> contained raised levels of both pax <dig> and pax <dig>  quantitative rt-pcr confirmed an increase in levels of pax <dig> mrna in cells containing pax6-expressing constructs and an increase in levels of pax <dig> mrna in cells containing pax6-expressing constructs. the fact that the introduction of constructs expressing only one isoform increased the cellular levels of not only that isoform but also the other indicates that activation of the endogenous pax <dig> locus occurred. the ratio between the levels of the two isoforms was maintained close to physiological values. the overexpression of either isoform in neuroblastoma  cell lines also promoted morphological change and an increase in Î²-iii-tubulin expression, indicating an increase in neurogenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that pax <dig> can up-regulate production of pax <dig> protein from an entire intact endogenous pax <dig> locus in its genomic environment. this adds to previous studies showing that pax <dig> can up-regulate reporter expression driven by isolated pax <dig> regulatory elements. furthermore, our results suggest that an important function of positive feedback might be to stabilise the relative levels of pax <dig> and pax <dig>
