BACKGROUND
the gastrointestinal tract is the primary site of toxin interaction, an interface between the organism and its surroundings. in this study, we assessed the alteration of intestinal mrna profile in the case of co-occurrence of zearalenone , a secondary fusarium metabolite, and escherichia coli , on the intestinal porcine epithelial cells ipec- <dig>  we chose this model since the pig is a species which is susceptible to pathogen and mycotoxin co-exposure.


RESULTS
after treating the cells with the two contaminants, either separately or in combination, the differential gene expression between groups was assessed, using the microarray technology. data analysis identified  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes as a response to e. coli exposure, while for zea treated cells,  <dig> genes were upregulated and  <dig> downregulated. the co-contamination led to  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes. the altered gene expression pattern was further classified into  <dig> functional groups. in the case of co-exposure to zea and e.coli, a clear increase of proinflammatory mechanisms.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate the complex effect of single or multiple contaminants exposure at cellular and molecular level, with significant implications that might lead to the activation of pathological mechanisms. a better understanding of the effects of co-contamination is mandatory in developing novel exposure regulations and prevention measures.
