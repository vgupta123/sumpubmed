BACKGROUND
although probiotic bacteria and their metabolites alter enterocyte gene expression, rapid, non-genomic responses have not been examined. the present study measured accumulation of tracer  glucose by caco- <dig> cells after exposure for  <dig> min or less to a chemically defined medium  with different monosaccharides before and after anaerobic culture of probiotic lactobacilli.


RESULTS
growth of l. acidophilus was supported by cdm with  <dig> mm glucose, fructose, and mannose, but not with arabinose, ribose, and xylose or the sugar-free cdm. glucose accumulation was reduced when caco- <dig> cells were exposed for  <dig> min to sterile cdm with glucose , mannose , fructose , and ribose , but not with arabinose and xylose. exposure of caco- <dig> cells for  <dig> min to bacteria-free supernatants prepared after exponential  and stationary  growth phases of l. acidophilus cultured in cdm with  <dig> mm fructose increased glucose accumulation by 83% and 45%, respectively; exposure to a suspension of the bacteria had no effect. the increase in glucose accumulation was diminished by heat-denaturing the supernatant, indicating the response of caco- <dig> cells is triggered by as yet unknown heat labile bacterial metabolites, not by a reduction in cdm components that decrease glucose uptake. supernatants prepared after anaerobic culture of l. gasseri, l. amylovorus, l. gallinarum, and l. johnsonii in the cdm with fructose increased glucose accumulation by 83%, 32%, 27%, and 14%, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the rapid, non-genomic upregulation of sglt <dig> by bacterial metabolites is a heretofore unrecognized interaction between probiotics and the intestinal epithelium.
