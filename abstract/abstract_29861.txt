BACKGROUND
protein kinases and phosphatases regulate protein phosphorylation, a critical means of modulating protein function, stability and localization. the identification of functional networks for protein phosphatases has been slow due to their redundant nature and the lack of large-scale analyses. we hypothesized that a genome-scale analysis of genetic interactions using the synthetic genetic array could reveal protein phosphatase functional networks. we apply this approach to the conserved type  <dig> protein phosphatase glc <dig>  which regulates numerous cellular processes in budding yeast.


RESULTS
we created a novel glc <dig> catalytic mutant . phenotypic analysis indicates that this novel allele exhibits slow growth and defects in glucose metabolism but normal cell cycle progression and chromosome segregation. this suggests that glc7-e101q is a hypomorphic glc <dig> mutant. synthetic genetic array analysis of glc7-e101q revealed a broad network of  <dig> synthetic sick/lethal interactions reflecting that many processes are required when glc <dig> function is compromised such as histone modification, chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, nutrient sensing and dna damage. in addition, mitochondrial activity and inheritance and lipid metabolism were identified as new processes involved in buffering glc <dig> function. an interaction network among  <dig> genes genetically interacting with glc <dig> was constructed by integration of genetic and physical interaction data. the obtained network has a modular architecture, and the interconnection among the modules reflects the cooperation of the processes buffering glc <dig> function.


CONCLUSIONS
we found  <dig> genes required for the normal growth of the glc7-e101q mutant. functional grouping of these genes and analysis of their physical and genetic interaction patterns bring new information on glc7-regulated processes.
