BACKGROUND
during development, different signaling pathways interact to specify cell fate by regulating transcription factors necessary for fate specification and morphogenesis. in caenorhabditis elegans, the egf-ras and wnt signaling pathways have been shown to interact to specify cell fate in three equivalence groups: the vulval precursor cells , the hook competence group  and p11/ <dig>  in the vpcs, hcg and p11/ <dig> pair, egf and wnt signaling positively regulate different hox genes, each of which also functions during fate specification. in the male, egf-ras signaling is required to specify the bγ fate within the bγ/δ equivalence pair, while notch signaling is required for bδ fate specification. in addition, tgf-β signaling by dbl-1/dpp controls ceh-13/labial/hox <dig> expression in bγ.


RESULTS
we show that egf-ras signaling is required for bγ expression of ceh-13/labial/hox <dig>  the transcription factors lin-1/ets and lin-31/forkhead, functioning downstream of the egf pathway, as well as sur-2/med <dig>  also control ceh- <dig> expression in bγ. in addition, our results indicate that lin-44/wnt, mom-2/wnt and lin-17/fz are necessary to maintain the division of bγ along a longitudinal axis. we also show that dbl-1/dpp acts either in parallel or downstream of egf pathway to regulate ceh-13/hox <dig> expression in bγ. lastly, we find that a dbl-1/dpp null mutation did not cause any vulval or p <dig> defects and did not enhance vulval and p <dig> defects of reduction-of-function mutations of components of the egf pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
ceh-13/labial/hox <dig> expression in bγ is regulated by the egf pathway and downstream factors lin-1/ets lin-31/forkhead and sur-2/med <dig>  wnt signaling is required for proper bγ division, perhaps to orient the bγ mitotic spindle. our results suggest that dbl-1/dpp is not required for vpc and p <dig> specification, highlighting another difference among these egf-dependent equivalence groups.
