BACKGROUND
small rnas , including small interfering rnas  and micrornas , have emerged as important regulators of eukaryotic gene expression. in plants, mirnas play critical roles in development, nutrient homeostasis and abiotic stress responses. accumulating evidence also reveals that srnas are involved in plant immunity. most studies on pathogen-regulated srnas have been conducted in arabidopsis plants infected with the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae, or treated with the flagelin-derived elicitor peptide flg <dig> from p. syringae. this work investigates srnas that are regulated by elicitors from the fungus fusarium oxysporum in arabidopsis.


RESULTS
microarray analysis revealed alterations on the accumulation of a set of srnas in response to elicitor treatment, including mirnas and small rna sequences derived from massively parallel signature sequencing. among the elicitor-regulated mirnas was mir <dig> which regulates argonaute <dig>  the core component of the rna-induced silencing complex involved in mirna functioning. promoter analysis in transgenic arabidopsis plants revealed transcriptional activation of mir <dig> by fungal elicitors. furthermore, transgenic plants expressing a gfp-mir <dig> sensor gene confirmed that the elicitor-induced mir <dig> is active. mir <dig>  targeting chromomethylase <dig>  involved in rna-directed dna methylation  was also found to be regulated by fungal elicitors. in addition to known mirnas, microarray analysis allowed the identification of an elicitor-inducible small rna that was incorrectly annotated as a mirna. studies on arabidopsis mutants impaired in small rna biogenesis demonstrated that this srna, is a heterochromatic-sirna  named as sirna <dig>  hc-sirnas are known to be involved in rna-directed dna methylation . sirna <dig> is detected in several plant species.


CONCLUSIONS
results here presented support a transcriptional regulatory mechanism underlying mir <dig> expression. this finding highlights the importance of mirna functioning in adaptive processes of arabidopsis plants to fungal infection. the results of this study also lay a foundation for the involvement of rddm processes through the activity of sirna <dig> and mir <dig> in mediating regulation of immune responses in arabidopsis plants.
