BACKGROUND
genomic characterization of rotavirus  has not been adopted at large-scale due to the complexity of obtaining sequences for all  <dig> segments, particularly when feces are used as starting material.

methods
to overcome these limitations, we developed a novel rov capture and genome sequencing method combining commercial enzyme immunoassay plates and a set of routinely used reagents.


RESULTS
our approach had a 100% success rate, producing >90% genome coverage for diverse rov present in fecal samples .


CONCLUSIONS
this method provides a novel, reproducible and comparatively simple approach for genomic rov characterization and could be scaled-up for use in global rov surveillance systems.
