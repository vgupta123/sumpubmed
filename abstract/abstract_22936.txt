BACKGROUND
the first row transition metal ions zinc and copper are essential to the survival of many organisms, although in excess these ions are associated with significant toxicity. here, we examined the impact of zinc and copper stress on acinetobacter baumannii, a common opportunistic pathogen.


RESULTS
we show that extracellular zinc stress induces a copper-specific depletion phenotype in a. baumannii atcc  <dig>  supplementation with copper not only fails to rescue this phenotype, but further exacerbates the copper depletion. extensive analysis of the a. baumannii atcc  <dig> genome identified  <dig> putative zinc/copper resistance efflux pumps. transcriptional analyses show that four of these transporters are responsive to zinc stress, five to copper stress and seven to the combination of zinc and copper stress, thereby revealing a likely foundation for the zinc-induced copper starvation in a. baumannii. in addition, we show that zinc and copper play crucial roles in management of oxidative stress and the membrane composition of a. baumannii. further, we reveal that zinc and copper play distinct roles in macrophage-mediated killing of this pathogen.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, this study supports the targeting of metal ion homeostatic mechanisms as an effective antimicrobial strategy against multi-drug resistant bacterial pathogens.
