BACKGROUND
siglec- <dig>  a sialic acid binding inhibitory receptor expressed by nk cells is masked in vivo by a so far unknown ligand. it shows a strong binding prevalence for Î±- <dig> -linked disialic acids in vitro.


RESULTS
here we describe the expression of psa-ncam  on functional adult peripheral blood natural killer cells and examine its possible role in masking siglec- <dig>  unmasking of siglec- <dig> using clostridium perfringens neuraminidase massively reduces nk cell cytotoxicity. by contrast a specific removal of psa using endo-nf does not lead to a reduction of nk cell cytotoxicity.


CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here therefore indicate that psa-ncam is not involved in masking siglec- <dig>
