BACKGROUND
the diversity of parasites attacking a host varies substantially among different host species. understanding the factors that explain these patterns of parasite diversity is critical to identifying the ecological principles underlying biodiversity. seabirds  and their ectoparasitic lice  are ideal model groups in which to study correlates of parasite species richness. we evaluated the relative importance of morphological , life-history , ecological  and behavioural  variables as predictors of louse diversity on  <dig> seabird hosts species. diversity was measured at the level of louse suborder, genus, and species, and uneven sampling of hosts was controlled for using literature citations as a proxy for sampling effort.


RESULTS
the only variable consistently correlated with louse diversity was host population size and to a lesser extent geographic range. other variables such as clutch size, longevity, morphological and behavioural variables including body mass showed inconsistent patterns dependent on the method of analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
the comparative analysis presented herein is  the first to test correlates of parasite species richness in seabirds. we believe that the comparative data and phylogeny provide a valuable framework for testing future evolutionary hypotheses relating to the diversity and distribution of parasites on seabirds.
