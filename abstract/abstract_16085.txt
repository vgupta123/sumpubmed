BACKGROUND
the dna-dependent protein kinase  is a nuclear complex composed of a large catalytic subunit  and a heterodimeric dna-targeting subunit ku. dna-pk is a major component of the non-homologous end-joining  repair mechanism, which is activated in the presence of dna double-strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation, reactive oxygen species and radiomimetic drugs. we have recently reported that down-regulation of protein kinase ck <dig> by sirna interference results in enhanced cell death specifically in dna-pkcs-proficient human glioblastoma cells, and this event is accompanied by decreased autophosphorylation of dna-pkcs at s <dig> and delayed repair of dna double-strand breaks.


RESULTS
in the present study, we show that ck <dig> co-localizes with phosphorylated histone h2ax to sites of dna damage and while ck <dig> gene knockdown is associated with delayed dna damage repair, its overexpression accelerates this process. we report for the first time evidence that lack of ck <dig> destabilizes the interaction of dna-pkcs with dna and with ku <dig> at sites of genetic lesions. furthermore, we show that ck <dig> regulates the phosphorylation levels of dna-pkcs only in response to direct induction of dna double-strand breaks.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these results strongly indicate that ck <dig> plays a prominent role in nhej by facilitating and/or stabilizing the binding of dna-pkcs and, possibly other repair proteins, to the dna ends contributing to efficient dna damage repair in mammalian cells.
