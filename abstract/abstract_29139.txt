BACKGROUND
genetic mapping is a powerful method to identify mutations that cause drug resistance and other phenotypic changes in the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. for efficient mapping of a target gene, it is often necessary to genotype a large number of polymorphic markers. currently, a community effort is underway to collect single nucleotide polymorphisms  from the parasite genome. here we evaluate polymorphism detection accuracy of a high-density 'tiling' microarray with  <dig>  million probes by comparing single feature polymorphisms  calls from the microarray with known snp among parasite isolates.


RESULTS
we found that probe gc content, snp position in a probe, probe coverage, and signal ratio cutoff values were important factors for accurate detection of sfp in the parasite genome. we established a set of sfp calling parameters that could predict msfp  with high accuracy  and identified  <dig>  msfp genome-wide from five parasite isolates including  <dig>  unique msfp  and ~ <dig>  new msfp, producing a genetic map with an average of one unique msfp per  <dig> bp. genomic copy number variation  among the parasites was also cataloged and compared.


CONCLUSIONS
a large number of msfp were discovered from the p. falciparum genome using a high-density microarray, most of which were in clusters of highly polymorphic genes at chromosome ends. our method for accurate msfp detection and the msfp identified will greatly facilitate large-scale studies of genome variation in the p. falciparum parasite and provide useful resources for mapping important parasite traits.
