BACKGROUND
designing sustainable animal production systems that better balance productivity and resistance to disease is a major concern. in order to address questions related to immunity and resistance to disease in pig, it is necessary to increase knowledge on its immune system and to produce efficient tools dedicated to this species.


RESULTS
a long-oligonucleotide-based chip referred to as sla-ri/nrsp8-13k was produced by combining a generic set with a newly designed sla-ri set that targets all annotated loci of the pig major histocompatibility complex  region  in both orientations as well as immunity genes outside the sla complex.

the chip was used to study the immune response of pigs following stimulation of porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells  with lipopolysaccharide  or a mixture of phorbol myristate acetate  and ionomycin for  <dig> hours. transcriptome analysis revealed that ten times more genes were differentially expressed after pma/ionomycin stimulation than after lps stimulation. lps stimulation induced a general inflammation response with over-expression of saa <dig>  pro-inflammatory chemokines il <dig>  ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> as well as genes related to oxidative processes  and calcium pathways . pma/ionomycin stimulation induced a stronger up-regulation of t cell activation than of b cell activation with dominance toward a th <dig> response, including il <dig>  cd <dig> and tnfrsf <dig>  genes. in addition, a very intense repression of thbs <dig>  was observed. repression of mhc class i genes was observed after pma/ionomycin stimulation despite an up-regulation of the gene cascade involved in peptide processing. repression of mhc class ii genes was observed after both stimulations. our results provide preliminary data suggesting that antisense transcripts mapping to the sla complex may have a role during immune response.


CONCLUSIONS
the sla-ri/nrsp8-13k chip was found to accurately decipher two distinct immune response activations of pbmcs indicating that it constitutes a valuable tool to further study immunity and resistance to disease in pig. the transcriptome analysis revealed specific and common features of the immune responses depending on the stimulation agent that increase knowledge on pig immunity.
