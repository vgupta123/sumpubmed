BACKGROUND
increasingly high amounts of heterogeneous and valuable controlled biomolecular annotations are available, but far from exhaustive and scattered in many databases. several annotation integration and prediction approaches have been proposed, but these issues are still unsolved. we previously created a genomic and proteomic knowledge base  that efficiently integrates many distributed biomolecular annotation and interaction data of several organisms, including  <dig> , <dig> gene annotations,  <dig> , <dig> protein annotations and  <dig>  protein-protein interactions .


RESULTS
by comprehensively leveraging transitive relationships defined by the numerous association data integrated in gpkb, we developed a software procedure that effectively detects and supplement consistent biomolecular annotations not present in the integrated sources. according to some defined logic rules, it does so only when the semantic type of data and of their relationships, as well as the cardinality of the relationships, allow identifying molecular biology compliant annotations. thanks to controlled consistency and quality enforced on data integrated in gpkb, and to the procedures used to avoid error propagation during their automatic processing, we could reliably identify many annotations, which we integrated in gpkb. they comprise  <dig>  gene to pathway and  <dig>  gene to biological function annotations of many organisms, and  <dig>  candidate associations between  <dig> genetic disorders and  <dig> human ppis. overall estimated recall and precision of our approach were  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively. co-functional evaluation of genes with known function showed high functional similarity between genes with new detected and known annotation to the same pathway; considering also the new detected gene functional annotations enhanced such functional similarity, which resembled the one existing between genes known to be annotated to the same pathway. strong evidence was also found in the literature for the candidate associations detected between cystic fibrosis disorder and the ppis between the cftr_human, derl1_human, rnf5_human, ahsa1_human and gopc_human proteins, and between the chip_human and hsp7c_human proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
although identified gene annotations and ppi-genetic disorder candidate associations require biological validation, our approach intrinsically provides their in silico evidence based on available data. public availability within the gpkb  of all identified and integrated annotations offers a valuable resource fostering new biomedical-molecular knowledge discoveries.
