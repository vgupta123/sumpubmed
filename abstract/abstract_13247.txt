BACKGROUND
sox <dig> is a multi-faceted transcription factor involved in the terminal differentiation of many different cell types in vertebrates. it has been suggested that in mice as well as in zebrafish sox <dig> plays a role in the terminal differentiation of skeletal muscle by suppressing transcription of slow fiber specific genes. in order to understand how sox <dig> coordinately regulates the transcription of multiple fiber type specific genes during muscle development, we have performed chip-seq analyses to identify sox <dig> target genes in mouse fetal myotubes and generated muscle-specific sox <dig> knockout  mice to determine the sox <dig> null muscle phenotype in adult mice.


RESULTS
we have identified  <dig>  sox <dig> binding sites using mouse fetal myotubes. the sox <dig> binding sites were found to be associated with slow fiber-specific, cardiac, and embryonic isoform genes that are expressed in the sarcomere as well as transcription factor genes known to play roles in muscle development. the concurrently performed rna polymerase ii  chip-seq analysis revealed that 84% of the sox <dig> peak-associated genes exhibited little to no binding of pol ii, suggesting that the majority of the sox <dig> target genes are transcriptionally inactive. these results indicate that sox <dig> directly regulates terminal differentiation of muscle by affecting the expression of sarcomere protein genes as well as indirectly through influencing the expression of transcription factors relevant to muscle development. gene expression profiling of sox <dig> ko skeletal and cardiac muscle revealed a significant increase in the expression of the genes associated with sox <dig> binding. in the absence of the sox <dig> gene, there was dramatic upregulation of slow fiber-specific, cardiac, and embryonic isoform gene expression in sox <dig> ko skeletal muscle and fetal isoform gene expression in sox <dig> ko cardiac muscle, thus confirming the role sox <dig> plays as a transcriptional suppressor in muscle development.


CONCLUSIONS
our present data indicate that during development, sox <dig> functions as a transcriptional suppressor of fiber type-specific and developmental isoform genes to promote functional specification of muscle which is critical for optimum muscle performance and health.
