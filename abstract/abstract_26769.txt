BACKGROUND
thymoma is a heterogeneous group of tumors in biology and clinical behavior. even though thymoma is divided into five subgroups following the world health organization classification, the nature of the disease is mixed within the subgroups.


RESULTS
we investigated the molecular characteristics of genetic changes variation of thymoma using cdna microarray based-comparative genomic hybridization  with a  <dig> k cdna microarray in an indirect, sex-matched design. genomic dna from the paraffin embedded  <dig> thymoma tissues  labeled with cy- <dig> was co-hybridized with the reference placenta gdna labeled with cy- <dig>  using the camvs software, we investigated the deletions on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> throughout the thymoma. then, we evaluated the genetic variations of thymoma based on the subgroups and the clinical behavior. first, the  <dig> significant genes differentiating five subgroups were selected by significance analysis of microarray. based on these genes, type ab was suggested to be heterogeneous at the molecular level as well as histologically. next, we observed that the thymoma was divided into a, b  and b <dig> subgroups with  <dig> significant genes. in addition, we selected  <dig> genes differentiating types a and b <dig>  which differ largely in clinical behaviors. finally, the  <dig> heterogeneous ab subtypes were able to correctly assign into a and b  types based on their genetic characteristics.


CONCLUSIONS
in our study, we observed the genome-wide chromosomal aberrations of thymoma and identified significant gene sets with genetic variations related to thymoma subgroups, which might provide useful information for thymoma pathobiology.
