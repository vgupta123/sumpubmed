BACKGROUND
the ultra-low redox potential and zinc binding properties of the intracellular pool of mammalian metallothioneins  suggest a role for mt in the transduction of redox signals into intracellular zinc signals. increased expression of mt after exposure to heavy metals, oxidative stress, or inflammatory cytokines leads to an increased intracellular redox-mobilizable zinc pool that can affect downstream zinc-sensitive signaling pathways. cd4+ t helper cells are poised to be influenced by mt transduced zinc signaling because they produce intracellular reactive oxygen species following activation through the t cell receptor and are sensitive to small changes in intracellular .


RESULTS
mt expression and intracellular  are both increased during primary activation and expansion of naïve cd4+ t cells into the tr <dig> phenotype in vitro. when tr <dig> cells from wildtype mice are compared with congenic mice lacking functional mt <dig> and mt <dig> genes, the expression of intracellular mt is associated with a greater increase in intracellular  immediately following exposure to reactive oxygen species or upon restimulation through the t cell receptor. the release of zn2+ from mt is associated with a greater increase in p <dig> mapk activation following restimulation and decreased p <dig> mapk activation in mt knockout tr <dig> cells can be rescued by increasing intracellular . additionally, il- <dig> secretion is increased in mt knockout tr <dig> cells compared with wildtype controls and this increase is prevented when the intracellular  is increased experimentally.


CONCLUSIONS
differences in zinc signaling associated with mt expression appear to be a result of preferential oxidation of mt and concomitant release of zn2+. although zinc is released from many proteins following oxidation, release is greater when the cell contains an intracellular pool of mt. by expressing mt in response to certain environmental conditions, cd4+ t cells are able to more efficiently release intracellular zinc and regulate signaling pathways following stimulation. the link between mt expression and increased zinc signaling following activation represents an important immunomodulatory mechanism of mt and illuminates the complex role mt plays in shaping immune responses.
