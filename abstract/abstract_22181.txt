BACKGROUND
pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola is a gram-negative plant-pathogenic bacterium that causes "halo blight" disease of beans . this disease affects both foliage and pods, and is a major problem in temperate areas of the world. although several bacterial genes have been determined as participants in pathogenesis, the overall process still remains poorly understood, mainly because the identity and function of many of the genes are largely unknown. in this work, a genomic library of p. syringae pv. phaseolicola nps <dig> was constructed and pcr amplification of individual fragments was carried out in order to print a dna microarray. this microarray was used to identify genes that are differentially expressed when bean leaf extracts, pod extracts or apoplastic fluid were added to the growth medium.


RESULTS
transcription profiles show that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed, the majority under the effect of bean leaf extract and apoplastic fluid. some of the induced genes were previously known to be involved in the first stages of the bacterial-plant interaction and virulence. these include genes encoding type iii secretion system proteins and genes involved in cell-wall degradation, phaseolotoxin synthesis and aerobic metabolism. on the other hand, most repressed genes were found to be involved in the uptake and metabolism of iron.


CONCLUSIONS
this study furthers the understanding of the mechanisms involved, responses and the metabolic adaptation that occurs during the interaction of p. syringae pv. phaseolicola with a susceptible host plant.
