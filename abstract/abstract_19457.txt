BACKGROUND
salmonella paratyphi c is one of the few human-adapted pathogens along with s. typhi, s. paratyphi a and s. paratyphi b that cause typhoid, but it is not clear whether these bacteria cause the disease by the same or different pathogenic mechanisms. notably, these typhoid agents have distinct sets of large genomic insertions, which may encode different pathogenicity factors. previously we identified a novel prophage, spc-p <dig>  in s. paratyphi c rks <dig> and wondered whether it might be involved in pathogenicity of the bacteria.


RESULTS
we analyzed the sequence of spc-p <dig> and found that it is an inducible phage with an overall g+c content of  <dig> %, similar to that of most salmonella phages such as p <dig> and st64t but significantly lower than the  <dig> % average of the rks <dig> chromosome. electron microscopy showed short-tailed phage particles very similar to the lambdoid phage cus- <dig>  to evaluate its roles in pathogenicity, we lysogenized s. paratyphi c strain cn13/ <dig>  which did not have this prophage, and infected mice with the lysogenized cn13/ <dig>  compared to the phage-free wild type cn13/ <dig>  the lysogenized cn13/ <dig> exhibited significantly increased virulence and caused multi-organ damages in mice at considerably lower infection doses.


CONCLUSIONS
spc-p <dig> contributes pathogenicity to s. paratyphi c in animal infection models, so it is possible that this prophage is involved in typhoid pathogenesis in humans. genetic and functional analyses of spc-p <dig> may facilitate the study of pathogenic evolution of the extant typhoid agents, providing particular help in elucidating the pathogenic determinants of the typhoid agents.
