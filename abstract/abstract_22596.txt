BACKGROUND
cryptosporidium spp. and giardia duodenalis are important gastrointestinal protists in humans and animals worldwide. in china, bovine cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis are of increasing concern because cattle are important reservoirs of these parasites, which have become potential threats to public health and to large numbers of cattle in recent years.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> fecal samples from the ningxia autonomous region were examined. the overall infection rates for cryptosporidium spp. and g. duodenalis were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. cryptosporidium was only detected in preweaned calves and adults older than 2 years, whereas g. duodenalis was only detected in calves aged less than 11 months. cryptosporidium spp. were characterized with a pcr–restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and dna sequence analysis of the small subunit rrna gene. three cryptosporidium species were identified: c. parvum  and c. bovis  in preweaned calves, and c. andersoni  in adults aged over 2 years. a dna sequence analysis of the gp <dig> gene suggested that the  <dig> c. parvum isolates all belonged to subtype iida15g <dig>  twenty-nine g. duodenalis isolates were analyzed by dna sequencing of the triosephosphate isomerase  and glutamate dehydrogenase  genes. two g. duodenalis assemblages were identified, assemblages e  and b  in preweaned calves, and assemblage e  in 3–11-month-old calves.


CONCLUSIONS
the predominance of c. parvum detected in preweaned calves and the first identified subtype iida15g <dig> in dairy cattle, and the dominant g. duodenalis assemblage e in this study differed considerably from those found in henan, heilongjiang, and shannxi provinces. our findings further confirm the dominance of c. parvum iid subtypes in china.
