BACKGROUND
toll-like receptor  <dig>  is widely recognized as an essential element in the triggering of innate immunity, binding pathogen-associated molecules such as lipopolysaccharide , and in initiating a cascade of pro-inflammatory events. evidence for tlr <dig> expression in non-immune cells, including pancreatic β-cells, has been shown, but, the functional role of tlr <dig> in the physiology of human pancreatic β-cells is still to be clearly established. we investigated whether tlr <dig> is present in β-cells purified from freshly isolated human islets and confirmed the results using min <dig> mouse insulinoma cells, by analyzing the effects of tlr <dig> expression on cell viability and insulin homeostasis.


RESULTS
cd11b positive macrophages were practically absent from isolated human islets obtained from non-diabetic brain-dead donors, and tlr <dig> mrna and cell surface expression were restricted to β-cells. a significant loss of cell viability was observed in these β-cells indicating a possible relationship with tlr <dig> expression. monitoring gene expression in β-cells exposed for 48h to the prototypical tlr <dig> ligand lps showed a concentration-dependent increase in tlr <dig> and cd <dig> transcripts and decreased insulin content and secretion. tlr4-positive min <dig> cells were also lps-responsive, increasing tlr <dig> and cd <dig> mrna levels and decreasing cell viability and insulin content.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data indicate a novel function for tlr <dig> as a molecule capable of altering homeostasis of pancreatic β-cells.
