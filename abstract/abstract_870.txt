BACKGROUND
although β-lactam antibiotics are heavily used in many developing countries, the diversity of β-lactamase genes  is poorly understood. we screened for major β-lactamase phenotypes and diversity of bla genes among  <dig> e. coli strains isolated from clinical samples obtained between  <dig> and  <dig> from hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients.


RESULTS
none of the isolates was resistant to carbapenems but 30% of all isolates were susceptible to cefepime, cephamycins and piperacillin-tazobactam. narrow spectrum β-lactamase  phenotype was observed in  <dig>  isolates that contained blatem- <dig>  or blashv- <dig>  or both . extended spectrum β-lactamase  phenotype was detected in  <dig>  isolates which carried blactx-m- <dig> , blactx-m- <dig> , blactx-m- <dig> , blactx-m- <dig> , blactx-m- <dig> , blactx-m- <dig> , blashv- <dig> , blashv- <dig> , and blatem- <dig> . complex mutant tem-like  phenotype was detected in  <dig>  isolates which carried blatem- <dig> , while blatem- <dig>  blatem- <dig>  blatem- <dig>  blatem − <dig> and blatem- <dig> were detected in lower frequencies of between 7% and 11%. majority of isolates producing a combination of ctx-m-15 + oxa-1 + tem- <dig> exhibited resistance phenotypes barely indistinguishable from those of cmt-producers. although  <dig>  isolates exhibited inhibitor resistant tem-like  phenotype, blatem- <dig> was the only true irt-encoding gene identified in  <dig>  of strains with this phenotype while the rest produced a combination of tem-1 + oxa- <dig>  the pampcs-like phenotype was observed in  <dig>  isolates of which  <dig>  carried blacmy- <dig> while 18% contained blacmy- <dig> 

isolates from urine accounted for 53%, 53%, 74% and 72% of strains exhibiting complex phenotypes such as irt, esbl, cmt or pampc respectively. on the contrary, 55% isolates from stool exhibited the relatively more susceptible nsbl-like phenotype. all the phenotypes, and majority of the bla genes, were detected both in isolates from hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients but complex phenotypes were particularly common among strains obtained between  <dig> and  <dig> from urine of hospitalized patients.


CONCLUSIONS
the phenotypes and diversity of bla genes in e. coli strains implicated in clinical infections in non-hospitalized and hospitalized patients in kenya is worryingly high. in order to preserve the efficacy of β-lactam antibiotics, culture and susceptibility data should guide therapy and surveillance studies for β-lactamase-producers in developing countries should be launched.
