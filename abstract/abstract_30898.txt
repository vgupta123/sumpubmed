BACKGROUND
the availability of the complete chicken  genome sequence as well as a large number of chicken probes for fluorescent in-situ hybridization  and microarray resources facilitate comparative genomic studies between chicken and other bird species. in a previous study, we provided a comprehensive cytogenetic map for the turkey  and the first analysis of copy number variants  in birds. here, we extend this approach to the pekin duck , an obvious target for comparative genomic studies due to its agricultural importance and resistance to avian flu.


RESULTS
we provide a detailed molecular cytogenetic map of the duck genome through fish assignment of  <dig> chicken clones. we identified one inter- and six intrachromosomal rearrangements between chicken and duck macrochromosomes and demonstrated conserved synteny among all microchromosomes analysed. array comparative genomic hybridisation revealed  <dig> cnvs, of which  <dig> overlap previously designated "hotspot" regions between chicken and turkey.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest extensive conservation of avian genomes across  <dig> million years of evolution in both macro- and microchromosomes. the data on cnvs between chicken and duck extends previous analyses in chicken and turkey and supports the hypotheses that avian genomes contain fewer cnvs than mammalian genomes and that genomes of evolutionarily distant species share regions of copy number variation . our results will expedite duck genomics, assist marker development and highlight areas of interest for future evolutionary and functional studies.
