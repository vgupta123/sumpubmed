BACKGROUND
avian coccidiosis is a disease caused worldwide by several species of parasite eimeria that causes significant economic losses. this disease affects chickens development and production, that most of times is controlled with anticoccidial drugs. although efforts have been made to address this disease, they have been made to control eimeria sporozoites, although enteric stages are often vulnerable, however; the parasite oocyst remains a problem that must be controlled, as it has a resistant structure that facilitates dispersion. despite some commercial products based on chemical compounds have been developed as disinfectants that destroy oocysts, the solution of the problem remains to be solved.


RESULTS
in this work, we assessed in vitro anticoccidial activity of a compound secreted by yeast isolated in oocysts suspension from infected chickens. the yeast was molecularly identified as meyerozyma guilliermondii, and its anticoccidial activity against eimeria tenella oocysts was assessed. here, we report the damage to oocysts walls caused by m. guilliermondii culture, supernatant, supernatant extract and intracellular proteins. in all cases, a significant decreased of oocysts was observed.


CONCLUSIONS
the yeast meyerozyma guilliermondii secretes a compound with anticoccidial activity and also has a compound of protein nature that damages the resistant structure of oocyst, showing the potential of this yeast and its products as a feasible method of coccidiosis control.
