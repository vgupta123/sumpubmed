BACKGROUND
livestock has recently been identified as a new reservoir of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus . most isolates belong to st <dig> and are non-typeable with pfge using smai, making it difficult to study transmission and outbreaks. therefore, a new pfge using cfr9i, a neoschizomer of smai was optimized and evaluated to investigate st <dig> isolates.


RESULTS
after optimizing and evaluating the cfr9i pfge, clear and reproducible banding patterns were obtained from all previously non-typeable mrsa  isolates. the pfge patterns of st <dig> isolates showed more diversity than with spa-typing and/or mlst. the pfge results showed diversity within and between the two most prevalent spa-types of ntsmai -mrsa . no match was found, when comparing banding patterns of the ntsmai -mrsa with  <dig> different pfge types, obtained with smai digestion, in our database of more than  <dig> strains. furthermore, possible transmission among veterinarians and their family members was investigated and an outbreak of st <dig> mrsa in a residential care facility was confirmed with the cfr9i pfge.


CONCLUSIONS
the adjusted pfge can be used as a method for selecting important and distinct st <dig> isolates for further research. the adjustments in the pfge protocol using cfr9i are easy to implement to study the st <dig> clonal lineage in laboratories which already have a pfge facility.
