BACKGROUND
the r2r3-myb genes comprise one of the largest transcription factor gene families in plants, playing regulatory roles in plant-specific developmental processes, metabolite accumulation and defense responses. although genome-wide analysis of this gene family has been carried out in some species, the r2r3-myb genes in beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris  as the first sequenced member of the order caryophyllales, have not been analysed heretofore.


RESULTS
we present a comprehensive, genome-wide analysis of the myb genes from beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris  which is the first species of the order caryophyllales with a sequenced genome. a total of  <dig> r2r3-myb genes as well as genes encoding three other classes of myb proteins containing multiple myb repeats were identified and characterised with respect to structure and chromosomal organisation. also, organ specific expression patterns were determined from rna-seq data. the r2r3-myb genes were functionally categorised which led to the identification of a sugar beet-specific clade with an atypical amino acid composition in the r <dig> domain, putatively encoding betalain regulators. the functional classification was verified by experimental confirmation of the prediction that the r2r3-myb gene bv_iogq encodes a flavonol regulator.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides the first step towards cloning and functional dissection of the role of myb transcription factor genes in the nutritionally and evolutionarily interesting species b. vulgaris. in addition, it describes the flavonol regulator bvmyb <dig>  being the first sugar beet r2r3-myb with an experimentally proven function.
