BACKGROUND
genome-wide duplication is ubiquitous during diversification of the angiosperms, and gene duplication is one of the most important mechanisms for evolutionary novelties. as an indicator of functional evolution, the divergence of expression patterns following duplication events has drawn great attention in recent years. using large-scale whole-genome microarray data, we systematically analyzed expression divergence patterns of rice genes from block, tandem and dispersed duplications.


RESULTS
we found a significant difference in expression divergence patterns for the three types of duplicated gene pairs. expression correlation is significantly higher for gene pairs from block and tandem duplications than those from dispersed duplications. furthermore, a significant correlation was observed between the expression divergence and the synonymous substitution rate which is an approximate proxy of divergence time. thus, both duplication types and divergence time influence the difference in expression divergence. using a linear model, we investigated the influence of these two variables and found that the difference in expression divergence between block and dispersed duplicates is attributed largely to their different divergence time. in addition, the difference in expression divergence between tandem and the other two types of duplicates is attributed to both divergence time and duplication type.


CONCLUSIONS
consistent with previous studies on arabidopsis, our results revealed a significant difference in expression divergence between the types of duplicated genes and a significant correlation between expression divergence and synonymous substitution rate. we found that the attribution of duplication mode to the expression divergence implies a different evolutionary course of duplicated genes.
