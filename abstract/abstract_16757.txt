BACKGROUND
as farming of atlantic salmon is growing as an aquaculture enterprise, the need to identify the genomic mechanisms for specific traits is becoming more important in breeding and management of the animal. traits of importance might be related to growth, disease resistance, food conversion efficiency, color or taste. to identify genomic regions responsible for specific traits, genomic large insert libraries have previously proven to be of crucial importance. these large insert libraries can be screened using gene or genetic markers in order to identify and map regions of interest. furthermore, large-scale mapping can utilize highly redundant libraries in genome projects, and hence provide valuable data on the genome structure.


RESULTS
here we report the construction and characterization of a highly redundant bacterial artificial chromosome  library constructed from a norwegian aquaculture strain male of atlantic salmon . the library consists of a total number of  <dig>  <dig> clones, in which approximately  <dig>  <dig> are recombinants. the average insert size of the library is  <dig> kbp, representing 18-fold genome coverage. high-density filters each consisting of  <dig>  <dig> clones spotted in duplicates have been produced for hybridization screening, and are publicly available  <cit> . to characterize the library,  <dig> expressed sequence tags  derived overgos and  <dig> oligo sequences derived from microsatellite markers were used in hybridization screening of the complete bac library. secondary hybridizations with individual probes were performed for the clones detected. the bacs positive for the est probes were fingerprinted and mapped into contigs, yielding an average of  <dig> contigs for each probe. clones identified using genomic probes were pcr verified using microsatellite specific primers.


CONCLUSIONS
identification of genes and genomic regions of interest is greatly aided by the availability of the chori- <dig> atlantic salmon bac library. we have demonstrated the library's ability to identify specific genes and genetic markers using hybridization, pcr and fingerprinting experiments. in addition, multiple fingerprinting contigs indicated a pseudo-tetraploidity of the atlantic salmon genome. the highly redundant chori- <dig> bac library is expected to be an important resource for mapping and sequencing of the atlantic salmon genome.
