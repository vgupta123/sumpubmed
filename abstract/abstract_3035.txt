BACKGROUND
the transcription factor oct <dig> is highly expressed in pluripotent embryonic stem cells which are derived from the inner cell mass of mammalian blastocysts. pluripotency and self renewal are controlled by a transcription regulatory network governed by the transcription factors oct <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog. recent studies on reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells highlight oct <dig> as a key regulator of pluripotency.


RESULTS
we have carried out an integrated analysis of high-throughput data  and identified a core oct <dig> regulatory network in human embryonic stem cells consisting of  <dig> target genes. enrichment analysis with these target genes revealed that this integrative analysis increases the functional information content by factors of  <dig>  â€“  <dig>  compared to the individual studies. in order to identify potential regulatory co-factors of oct <dig>  we performed a de novo motif analysis. in addition to known validated oct <dig> motifs we obtained binding sites similar to motifs recognized by further regulators of pluripotency and development; e.g. the heterodimer of the transcription factors c-myc and max, a prerequisite for c-myc transcriptional activity that leads to cell growth and proliferation.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis shows how heterogeneous functional information can be integrated in order to reconstruct gene regulatory networks. as a test case we identified a core oct4-regulated network that is important for the analysis of stem cell characteristics and cellular differentiation. functional information is largely enriched using different experimental results. the de novo motif discovery identified well-known regulators closely connected to the oct <dig> network as well as potential new regulators of pluripotency and differentiation. these results provide the basis for further targeted functional studies.
