BACKGROUND
the tumor suppressor protein p <dig> is activated by cellular stress. dna double strand breaks  induce the activation of the kinase atm, which stabilizes p <dig> and activates its transcriptional activity. single cell analysis revealed that dsbs induced by gamma irradiation trigger p <dig> accumulation in a series of pulses that vary in number from cell to cell. higher levels of irradiation increase the number of p <dig> pulses suggesting that they arise from periodic examination of the damage by atm. if damage persists, additional pulses of p <dig> are triggered. the threshold of damage required for activating a p <dig> pulse is unclear. previous studies that averaged the response across cell populations suggested that one or two dna breaks are sufficient for activating atm and p <dig>  however, it is possible that by averaging over a population of cells important features of the dependency between dna breaks and p <dig> dynamics are missed.


RESULTS
using fluorescent reporters we developed a system for following in individual cells the number of dsbs, the kinetics of repair and the p <dig> response. we found a large variation in the initial number of dsbs and the rate of repair between individual cells. cells with higher number of dsbs had higher probability of showing a p <dig> pulse. however, there was no distinct threshold number of breaks for inducing a p <dig> pulse. we present evidence that the decision to activate p <dig> given a specific number of breaks is not entirely stochastic, but instead is influenced by both cell-intrinsic factors and previous exposure to dna damage. we also show that the natural variations in the initial amount of p <dig>  rate of dsb repair and cell cycle phase do not affect the probability of activating p <dig> in response to dna damage.


CONCLUSIONS
the use of fluorescent reporters to quantify dna damage and p <dig> levels in live cells provided a quantitative analysis of the complex interrelationships between both processes. our study shows that p <dig> activation differs even between cells that have a similar number of dna breaks. understanding the origin and consequences of such variability in normal and cancerous cells is crucial for developing efficient and selective therapeutic interventions.
