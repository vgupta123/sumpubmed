BACKGROUND
expressing microbial polysaccharide-modifying enzymes in plants is an attractive approach to custom tailor plant lignocellulose and to study the importance of wall structures to plant development. expression of α-glucuronidases in plants to modify the structures of glucuronoxylans has not been yet attempted. glycoside hydrolase  family  <dig> α-glucuronidases cleave the internal α-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid glca) from xylans or xylooligosaccharides. in this work, a gh <dig> α-glucuronidase from schizophyllum commune, scagu <dig>  was expressed in arabidopsis thaliana and targeted to apoplast. the transgene effects on native xylans’ structures, plant development, and lignocellulose saccharification were evaluated and compared to those of knocked out glucuronyltransferases atgux <dig> and atgux <dig> 


RESULTS
the scagu <dig> extracted from cell walls of arabidopsis was active on the internally substituted aldopentaouronic acid . the transgenic plants did not show any change in growth or in lignocellulose saccharification. the cell wall glca and other non-cellulosic sugars, as well as the lignin content, remained unchanged. in contrast, the gux1gux <dig> double mutant showed a 70% decrease in glca to xylose molar ratio, and, interestingly, a 60% increase in the xylose content. whereas scagu115-expressing plants exhibited a decreased signal in native secondary walls from the monoclonal antibody ux <dig> that recognizes glca on non-acetylated xylan, the signal was not affected after wall deacetylation. in contrast, gux1gux <dig> mutant was lacking ux <dig> signals in both native and deacetylated cell walls. this indicates that acetyl substitution on the xylopyranosyl residue carrying glca or on the neighboring xylopyranosyl residues may restrict post-synthetic modification of xylans by scagu <dig> in planta.


CONCLUSIONS
active gh <dig> α-glucuronidase has been produced for the first time in plants. the cell wall–targeted scagu <dig> was shown to affect those glucuronate substitutions of xylan, which are accessible to ux <dig> antibody and constitute a small fraction in arabidopsis, whereas majority of glca substitutions were resistant, most likely due to the shielding by acetyl groups. plants expressing scagu <dig> did not show any defects under laboratory conditions indicating that the ux <dig> epitope of xylan is not essential under these conditions. moreover the removal of the ux <dig> xylan epitope does not affect lignocellulose saccharification.
