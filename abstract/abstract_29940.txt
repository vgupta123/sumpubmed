BACKGROUND
in  <dig>  an outbreak of canine distemper virus  infection in monkeys was reported in china. we isolated cdv strain  from lung tissue obtained from a rhesus monkey that died in this outbreak. we evaluated the ability of this virus on vero cells expressing slam receptors from dog, monkey and human origin, and analyzed the h gene of monkey-bj01-dv with other strains.


RESULTS
the monkey-bj01-dv isolate replicated to the highest titer on vero cells expressing dog-origin slam  and monkey-origin slam , but achieved markedly lower titers on human-origin slam cells . phylogenetic analysis of the full-length h gene showed that monkey-bj01-dv was highly related to other cdv strains obtained during recent cdv epidemics among species of the canidae family in china, and these monkey strains cdv  possessed a number of amino acid specific substitutions  compared to the h protein of cdv epidemic in other animals at the same period.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggested that the monkey origin-cdv-h protein could possess specific substitutions to adapt to the new host. monkey-bj01-dv can efficiently use monkey- and dog-origin slam to infect and replicate in host cells, but further adaptation may be required for efficient replication in host cells expressing the human slam receptor.
