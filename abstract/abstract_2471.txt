BACKGROUND
atp binding is essential for the bioactivity of several growth factors including nerve growth factor, fibroblast growth factor- <dig> and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. vascular endothelial growth factor isoform  <dig>  induces the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, however a dependence on atp-binding is currently unknown. the aim of the present study was to determine if atp binding is essential for the bioactivity of vegf-a <dig> 


RESULTS
we found evidence that atp binding tovegf-a <dig> induced a conformational change in the secondary structure of the growth factor. this binding appears to be significant at the biological level, as we found evidence that nanomolar levels of atp  are required for the vegf-a165-induced proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. at these levels, purinergic signaling by atp via p <dig> receptors can be excluded. addition of alkaline phosphate to cell culture lowered the atp concentration in the cell culture medium to  <dig>  nm and inhibited cell proliferation.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that proliferation of endothelial cells is induced by a vegf-a165-atp complex, rather than vegf-a <dig> alone.
