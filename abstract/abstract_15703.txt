BACKGROUND
the aim of this study was to determine the catalytic activity and physiological role of myosin-cross-reactive antigen  from bifidobacterium breve ncimb  <dig>  mcra from b. breve ncimb  <dig> was cloned, sequenced and expressed in heterologous hosts  and the recombinant proteins assessed for enzymatic activity against fatty acid substrates.


RESULTS
mcra catalysed the conversion of palmitoleic, oleic and linoleic acids to the corresponding 10-hydroxy fatty acids, but shorter chain fatty acids were not used as substrates, while the presence of trans-double bonds and double bonds beyond the position c <dig> abolished hydratase activity. the hydroxy fatty acids produced were not metabolised further. we also found that heterologous lactococcus and corynebacterium expressing mcra accumulated increasing amounts of 10-hoa and 10-hoe in the culture medium. furthermore, the heterologous cultures exhibited less sensitivity to heat and solvent stresses compared to corresponding controls.


CONCLUSIONS
mcra protein in b. breve can be classified as a fad-containing double bond hydratase, within the carbon-oxygen lyase family, which may be catalysing the first step in conjugated linoleic acid  production, and this protein has an additional function in bacterial stress protection.
