BACKGROUND
the mus musculus musculus/m. m. domesticus contact zone in europe is characterised by sharp frequency discontinuities for sex chromosome markers at the centre of wider clines in allozyme frequencies.


RESULTS
we identify a triangular area  where the musculus y chromosome introgresses across this front for up to  <dig> km into domesticus territory. introgression of the y chromosome is accompanied by a perturbation of the census sex ratio: the sex ratio is significantly female biased in musculus localities and domesticus localities lacking y chromosome introgression. in contrast, where the musculus y is detected in domesticus localities, the sex ratio is close to parity, and significantly different from both classes of female biased localities. the geographic position of an abrupt cline in an x chromosome marker, and autosomal clines centred on the same position, seem unaffected by the musculus y introgression.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that sex ratio distortion is playing a role in the geographic separation of speciation genes in this section of the mouse hybrid zone. we suggest that clines for genes involved in sex-ratio distortion have escaped from the centre of the mouse hybrid zone, causing a decay in the barrier to gene flow between the two house mouse taxa.
