BACKGROUND
impaired diabetic wound healing occurs as a consequence of excessive reactive oxygen species  and inflammatory cytokine production. we previously found that whey protein  was able to normally regulate the ros and inflammatory cytokines during the inflammatory phase  in streptozotocin -diabetic wound healing. this study was designed to assess the effect of wp on metabolic status, the inflammation and anti-inflammation response, oxidative stress and the antioxidant defense system during different phases of the wound healing process in diabetic rats. wp at a dosage of  <dig> mg/kg of body weight, dissolved in 1% cmc, was orally administered daily to wounded normal  and stz-induced diabetic rats for  <dig> days starting from the 1st day after wounding.


RESULTS
the data revealed that wp enhanced wound closure and was associated with an increase in serum insulin levels in diabetic rats and an alleviation of hyperglycemic and hyperlipidemic states in diabetic animals. the increase in insulin levels as a result of wp administration is associated with a marked multiplication of β-cells in the core of islets of langerhans. wp induced a reduction in serum tnf-α, il-1β and il- <dig> levels and an increase in il- <dig> levels, especially on the 4th day after wounding and treatment. wp also suppressed hepatic lipid peroxidation and stimulated the antioxidant defense system by increasing the level of glutathione and the activity of glutathione-s-transferase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase  in wounded diabetic rats.


CONCLUSIONS
wp was observed to enhance wound closure by improving the diabetic condition, limiting prolonged inflammation, suppressing oxidative stress and elevating the antioxidant defense system in diabetic rats.
