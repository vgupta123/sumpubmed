BACKGROUND
breeding for enhanced immune response  has been suggested as a tool to improve inherent animal health. dairy cows with superior antibody-mediated  and cell-mediated immune responses  have been demonstrated to have a lower occurrence of many diseases including mastitis. adaptive immune response traits are heritable, and it is, therefore, possible to breed for improved ir, decreasing the occurrence of disease. the objective of this study was to perform genome-wide association studies to determine differences in genetic profiles among holstein cows classified as high or low for amir and cmir. from a total of  <dig> cows with immune response phenotypes,  <dig> cows for amir  and  <dig> for cmir  were selectively genotyped using the illumina bovine snp <dig> beadchip. results were validated using an unrelated population of  <dig> holstein bulls ir phenotyped for amir and  <dig> for cmir.


RESULTS
a generalized quasi likelihood score method was used to determine single nucleotide polymorphisms  and chromosomal regions associated with immune response. after applying a 5% chromosomal false discovery rate,  <dig> snps were significantly associated with amir. the majority  of significant markers were on chromosome  <dig>  with a similar peak found in the bull population. for cmir,  <dig> snp markers remained significant. candidate genes within  <dig>  base pairs of significant snps were identified to determine biological pathways associated with amir and cmir. various pathways were identified, including the antigen processing and presentation pathway, important in host defense. candidate genes included those within the bovine major histocompatability complex such as bola-dq, bola-dr and the non-classical bola-nc <dig> for amir and bola-dq for cmir, the complement system including c <dig> and c <dig> for amir and c1q for cmir, and cytokines including il-17a, il17f for amir and il-17ra for cmir and tumor necrosis factor for both amir and cmir. additional genes associated with cmir included galectins  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  bcl <dig> and β-defensin.


CONCLUSIONS
the significant genetic variation associated with amir and cmir in this study may imply feasibility to include immune response in genomic breeding indices as an approach to improve inherent animal health.
