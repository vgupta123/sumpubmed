BACKGROUND
r is the leading open source statistics software with a vast number of biostatistical and bioinformatical analysis packages. to exploit the advantages of r, extensive scripting/programming skills are required.


RESULTS
we have developed a software tool called r gui generator  which enables the easy generation of graphical user interfaces  for the programming language r by adding a few extensible markup language  â€“ tags. rgg consists of an xml-based gui definition language and a java-based gui engine. guis are generated in runtime from defined gui tags that are embedded into the r script. user-gui input is returned to the r code and replaces the xml-tags. rgg files can be developed using any text editor. the current version of rgg is available as a stand-alone software  and as a plug-in for jgr.


CONCLUSIONS
rgg is a general gui framework for r that has the potential to introduce r statistics  to users with limited programming skills and helps to bridge the gap between r developers and gui-dependent users. rgg aims to abstract the gui development from individual gui toolkits by using an xml-based gui definition language. thus rgg can be easily integrated in any software. the rgg project further includes the development of a web-based repository for rgg-guis. rgg is an open source project licensed under the lesser general public license  and can be downloaded freely at
