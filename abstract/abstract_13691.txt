BACKGROUND
vitamin b <dig> is a collective term for a group of six interconvertible compounds: pyridoxine, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and their phosphorylated derivatives. vitamin b <dig> plays essential roles as a cofactor in a range of biochemical reactions. in addition, vitamin b <dig> is able to quench reactive oxygen species in vitro, and exogenously applied vitamin b <dig> protects plant cells against cell death induced by singlet oxygen . these results raise the important question as to whether plants employ vitamin b <dig> as an antioxidant to protect themselves against reactive oxygen species.


RESULTS
the pdx <dig>  mutation affects the vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis enzyme, pyridoxal synthase , and leads to a reduction of the vitamin b <dig> concentration in arabidopsis thaliana leaves. although leaves of the pdx <dig>  arabidopsis mutant contained less chlorophyll than wild-type leaves, we found that vitamin b <dig> deficiency did not significantly impact photosynthetic performance or shoot and root growth. chlorophyll loss was associated with an increase in the chlorophyll a/b ratio and a selective decrease in the abundance of several psii antenna proteins . these changes were strongly dependent on light intensity, with high light amplifying the difference between pdx <dig>  and the wild type. when leaf discs were exposed to exogenous 1o <dig>  lipid peroxidation in pdx <dig>  was increased relative to the wild type; this effect was not observed with superoxide or hydrogen peroxide. when leaf discs or whole plants were exposed to excess light energy, 1o2-mediated lipid peroxidation was enhanced in leaves of the pdx <dig>  mutant relative to the wild type. high light also caused an increased level of 1o <dig> in vitamin b6-deficient leaves. combining the pdx <dig>  mutation with mutations affecting the level of 'classical' quenchers of 1o <dig>  resulted in a highly photosensitive phenotype.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that vitamin b <dig> has a function in the in vivo antioxidant defense of plants. thus, the antioxidant activity of vitamin b <dig> inferred from in vitro studies is confirmed in planta. together with the finding that chloroplasts contain vitamin b <dig> compounds, the data show that vitamin b <dig> functions as a photoprotector that limits 1o <dig> accumulation in high light and prevents 1o2-mediated oxidative damage.
