BACKGROUND
the transcription factor  p <dig> is a master regulator of epidermal development and differentiation as evident from the remarkable skin phenotype of p <dig> mouse knockouts. furthermore, ectopic expression of p <dig> alone is sufficient to convert simple epithelium into stratified epithelial tissues in vivo and p <dig> is required for efficient transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into keratinocytes. however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of p <dig> function, in particular how it selects its target sites in the genome. p <dig>  which acts both as an activator and repressor of transcription, recognizes a canonical binding motif that occurs over  <dig> million times in the human genome. but, in human keratinocytes less than  <dig>  of these sites are bound in vivo suggesting that underlying chromatin architecture and cooperating tfs mediate p63-genome interactions.


RESULTS
we find that the chromatin architecture at p63-bound targets possess distinctive features and can be used to categorize p <dig> targets into proximal promoters , enhancers  and repressed or inactive  regulatory elements. our analysis shows that the chromatin modifications h3k4me <dig>  h3k27me <dig>  along with overall chromatin accessibility status can accurately predict bonafide p63-bound sites without a priori dna sequence information. interestingly, however there exists a qualitative correlation between the p <dig> binding motif and accessibility and h3k4me <dig> levels. furthermore, we use a comprehensive in silico approach that leverages encode data to identify several known tfs such as ap <dig>  ap <dig> and novel tfs  that can potentially cooperate with p <dig> to modulate its myriad biological functions in keratinocytes.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis shows that p <dig> bound genomic locations in keratinocytes are accessible, marked by active histone modifications, and co-targeted by other developmentally important transcriptional regulators. collectively, our results suggest that p <dig> might actively remodel and/or influence chromatin dynamics at its target sites and in the process dictate its own dna binding and possibly that of adjacent tfs.
