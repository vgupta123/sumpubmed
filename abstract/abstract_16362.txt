BACKGROUND
hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase x  is a multifunctional protein encoded by the hsd17b <dig> gene at xp <dig> . in response to stress or hypoxia-ischemia its levels increase rapidly. expression of this gene is also elevated significantly in colonic mucosa of the inactive ulcerative colitis patients. however, accurate information about its several transcripts is still lacking, and additional evidence for its escape from x-chromosome inactivation remains to be obtained in order to help settle a debate .


RESULTS
two major hsd17b <dig> transcription start sites were identified by primer extension at - <dig> and - <dig> as well as a minor start site at - <dig> nucleotides from the initiation codon atg. epigenetic analysis of the 5â€™-flanking region of the hsd17b <dig> gene showed that there was little 5-methylcytosine  in a normal male, and that none of cpg dinucleotides in the cpg island approached 50% methylation in females.


CONCLUSIONS
the actual length of first exon of the hsd17b <dig> gene was found to be about a quarter larger than that originally reported. its transcripts result from a slippery transcription complex. the hypomethylation of the cpg island provides additional evidence for the variable escape of the hsd17b <dig> gene from x-chromosome inactivation which could influence the range of severity of hsd <dig> deficiency, an inherited error in isoleucine metabolism, in heterozygous females.
