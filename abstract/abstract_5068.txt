BACKGROUND
xanthophylls are oxygenated carotenoids playing an essential role as structural components of the photosynthetic apparatus. xanthophylls contribute to the assembly and stability of light-harvesting complex, to light absorbance and to photoprotection. the first step in xanthophyll biosynthesis from α- and β-carotene is the hydroxylation of ε- and β-rings, performed by both non-heme iron oxygenases  and p <dig> cytochromes . the arabidopsis triple chy1chy2lut <dig> mutant is almost completely depleted in β-xanthophylls.


RESULTS
here we report on the quadruple chy1chy2lut2lut <dig> mutant, additionally carrying the lut <dig> mutation . this genotype lacks lutein and yet it shows a compensatory increase in β-xanthophylls with respect to chy1chy2lut <dig> mutant. mutant plants show an even stronger photosensitivity than chy1chy2lut <dig>  a complete lack of qe, the rapidly reversible component of non-photochemical quenching, and a peculiar organization of the pigment binding complexes into thylakoids. biochemical analysis reveals that the chy1chy2lut2lut <dig> mutant is depleted in lhcb subunits and is specifically affected in photosystem i function, showing a deficiency in psi-lhci supercomplexes. moreover, by analyzing a series of single, double, triple and quadruple arabidopsis mutants in xanthophyll biosynthesis, we show a hitherto undescribed correlation between xanthophyll levels and the psi-psii ratio. the decrease in the xanthophyll/carotenoid ratio causes a proportional decrease in the lhcii and psi core levels with respect to psii.


CONCLUSIONS
the physiological and biochemical phenotype of the chy1chy2lut2lut <dig> mutant shows that  lut1/cyp97c <dig> protein reveals a major β-carotene hydroxylase activity in vivo when depleted in its preferred substrate α-carotene;  xanthophylls are needed for normal level of photosystem i and lhcii accumulation.
