BACKGROUND
dlk <dig> is an egf-like membrane protein, closely related to dlk <dig>  which is involved in adipogenesis. both proteins interact with the notch <dig> receptor and are able to modulate its activation. the expression of the gene dlk <dig> is coordinated with that of dlk <dig> in several tissues and cell lines. unlike dlk <dig>  the mouse dlk <dig> gene and its locus at chromosome  <dig> are not fully characterized.


RESULTS
the goal of this work was the characterization of dlk <dig> mrna, as well as the analysis of the mechanisms that control its basal transcription. first, we analyzed the dlk <dig> transcripts expressed by several mouse cells lines and tissues, and mapped the transcription start site by 5' rapid amplification of cdna ends. in silico analysis revealed that dlk <dig> possesses a tata-less promoter containing minimal promoter elements associated with a cpg island, and sequences for inr and dpe elements. besides, it possesses six gc-boxes, considered as consensus sites for the transcription factor sp <dig>  indeed, we report that sp <dig> directly binds to the dlk <dig> promoter, activates its transcription, and regulates its level of expression.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide the first characterization of dlk <dig> transcripts, map the location of the dlk <dig> core promoter, and show the role of sp <dig> as a key regulator of dlk <dig> transcription, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the expression of the dlk <dig> gene.
