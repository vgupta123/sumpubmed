BACKGROUND
striking interspecific variations in floral traits of the large temperate genus pedicularis have given rise to controversies concerning infra-generic classifications. to date, phylogenetic relationships within the genus have not been well resolved. the main goal of this study is to construct a backbone phylogeny of pedicularis, with extensive sampling of species from the himalaya-hengduan mountains. phylogenetic analyses included  <dig> species, representing all  <dig> informal groups and  <dig> out of  <dig> series in the classification system of tsoong, using sequences of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer  and three plastid regions . bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods were applied in separate and combined analyses of these datasets.


RESULTS
thirteen major clades are resolved with strong support, although the backbone of the tree is poorly resolved. there is little consensus between the phylogenetic tree and tsoong’s classification of pedicularis. only two of the  <dig> groups , and  <dig> of the  <dig> series  with more than one sampled species were found to be strictly monophyletic. most opposite-/whorled-leaved species fall into a single clade, i.e. clade  <dig>  while alternate leaves species occur in the remaining  <dig> clades. excluding the widespread p. verticillata in clade  <dig>  species from europe and north america fall into clades 6– <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that combinations of morphological and geographic characters associated with strongly supported clades are needed to elucidate a comprehensive global phylogeny of pedicularis. alternate leaves are inferred to be plesiomorphic in pedicularis, with multiple transitions to opposite/whorled phyllotaxy. alternate-leaved species show high diversity in plant habit and floral forms. in the himalaya-hengduan mountains, geographical barriers may have facilitated diversification of species with long corolla tubes, and the reproductive advantages of beakless galeas in opposite-/whorled-leaved species may boost speciation at high altitude.
