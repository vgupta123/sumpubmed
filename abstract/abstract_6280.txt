BACKGROUND
the biological information in genomic expression data can be understood, and computationally extracted, in the context of systems of interacting molecules. the automation of this information extraction requires high throughput management and analysis of genomic expression data, and integration of these data with other data types.


RESULTS
sbeams-microarray, a module of the open-source systems biology experiment analysis management system , enables miame-compliant storage, management, analysis, and integration of high-throughput genomic expression data. it is interoperable with the cytoscape network integration, visualization, analysis, and modeling software platform.


CONCLUSIONS
sbeams-microarray provides end-to-end support for genomic expression analyses for network-based systems biology research.
