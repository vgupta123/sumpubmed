BACKGROUND
multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification  is an efficient and reliable technique for gene dosage analysis. currently mlpa can be conducted on two platforms: traditional electrophoresis-based, and flexmap bead-coupled. since its introduction in  <dig>  mlpa has been rapidly adopted in both clinical and research situations. however, mlpa probe design is a time consuming process requiring many steps that address multiple criteria. there exist only one or two commercial software packages for traditional electrophoresis-based mlpa probe design. to our knowledge, no software is yet available that performs bead-coupled mlpa probe design.


RESULTS
we have developed h-mapd, a web-based tool that automates the generation and selection of probes for human genomic mlpa. the software performs physical-chemical property tests using unafold software, and uniqueness tests using the ucsc genome browser. h-mapd supports both traditional electrophoresis-based assays, as well as flexmap bead-coupled mlpa.


CONCLUSIONS
h-mapd greatly reduces the efforts for human genomic mlpa probe design. the software is written in perl-cgi, hosted on a linux server, and is freely available to non-commercial users.
