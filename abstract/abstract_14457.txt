BACKGROUND
the gene encoding pad <dig>  is required in arabidopsis for expression of several genes involved in the defense response to pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola. atpad <dig>  encodes a lipase-like protein that plays a regulatory role mediating salicylic acid signaling.


RESULTS
we expressed the gene encoding atpad <dig> in soybean roots of composite plants to test the ability of atpad <dig> to deter plant parasitic nematode development. the transformed roots were challenged with two different plant parasitic nematode genera represented by soybean cyst nematode  and root-knot nematode . expression of atpad <dig> in soybean roots decreased the number of mature scn females  <dig> days after inoculation by  <dig> percent. similarly, soybean roots expressing atpad <dig> exhibited  <dig> percent fewer galls when challenged with rkn.


CONCLUSIONS
our experiments show that atpad <dig> can be used in an economically important crop, soybean, to provide a measure of resistance to two different genera of nematodes.
