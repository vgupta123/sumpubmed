BACKGROUND
we earlier reported spontaneous features of asthma in vasoactive intestinal peptide knockout mice : 1) peribronchiolar airway inflammation, with accumulation of lymphocytes and eosinophils, 2) pro-inflammatory cytokine production of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  with ifn-Î³, and 3) airway hyper-responsiveness to inhaled methacholine. in human asthma, a phenotype with sulfite sensitivity leads to airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness to inhaled sulfites, and is associated with upregulation of anti-oxidant protein lung carbonyl reductase. for the present experiments, we examined the role of vip in modulating anti-oxidant genes and their proteins, including lung carbonyl reductase.


RESULTS
four male vip ko mice and four wild-type age- and gender matched mice had lungs examined for whole genome microarray and a proteomics approach using mass spectrometry. the proteomics analysis revealed that a novel variant of anti-oxidant protein lung carbonyl reductase  was uniquely and markedly elevated in the vip ko mice. rt-pcr indicated that carbonic anhydrase  <dig>  which is an anti-oxidant protein, was elevated in the vip ko mice.


CONCLUSIONS
these data support the concept that vip influences the endogenous oxidant/antioxidant balance. one potential implication is that vip and its analogues may be used to treat inflammatory diseases, including asthma.
