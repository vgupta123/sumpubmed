BACKGROUND
in  <dig>  a bat researcher in finland died of rabies encephalitis caused by european bat lyssavirus type  <dig> , but an epidemiological study in  <dig> did not reveal eblv-infected bats. in  <dig>  an eblv-2-positive daubenton’s bat was detected. the eblv- <dig> isolate from the human case in  <dig> and the isolate from the bat in  <dig> were genetically closely related. in order to assess the prevalence of eblvs in finnish bat populations and to gain a better understanding of the public health risk that eblv-infected bats pose, a targeted active surveillance project was initiated.


RESULTS
altogether,  <dig> bats of seven species were examined for lyssaviruses in finland during a 28–year period ,  <dig> in active surveillance and  <dig> in passive surveillance, with only one positive finding of eblv- <dig> in a daubenton’s bat in  <dig>  in 2010– <dig>  saliva samples from  <dig> bats of seven species were analyzed for eblv viral rna, and sera from  <dig> bats were analyzed for the presence of bat lyssavirus antibodies. antibodies were detected in daubenton’s bats in samples collected from two locations in  <dig> and from one location in  <dig>  all seropositive locations are in close proximity to the place where the eblv- <dig> positive daubenton’s bat was found in  <dig>  in active surveillance, no eblv viral rna was detected.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that eblv- <dig> may circulate in finland, even though the seroprevalence is low. our results indicate that passive surveillance of dead or sick bats is a relevant means examine the occurrence of lyssavirus infection, but the number of bats submitted for laboratory analysis should be higher in order to obtain reliable information on the lyssavirus situation in the country.
