BACKGROUND
cathelicidins comprise a major group of host-defence peptides. conserved across a wide range of species, they have several functions related to host defence. only one cathelicidin has been found in humans but several cathelicidin genes occur in the bovine genome. we propose that these molecules may have a protective role against mastitis. the aim of this study was to characterise the cathelicidin gene-cluster in the bovine genome and to identify sites of expression in the bovine mammary gland.


RESULTS
bioinformatic analysis of the bovine genome  revealed seven protein-coding cathelicidin genes, cathl1- <dig>  including two identical copies of cathl <dig>  as well as three additional putative cathelicidin genes, all clustered on the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  six of the seven protein-coding genes were expressed in leukocytes extracted from milk of high somatic cell count  cows. cathl <dig> was expressed across several sites in the mammary gland, but did not increase in response to staphylococcus aureus infection.


CONCLUSIONS
here, we characterise the bovine cathelicidin gene cluster and reconcile inconsistencies in the datasets of previous studies. constitutive cathelicidin expression in the mammary gland suggests a possible role for these host defence peptides its protection.
