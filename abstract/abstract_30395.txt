BACKGROUND
lung inflammation is a major consequence of the systemic inflammatory response caused by severe sepsis. increased migration of γδ t lymphocytes into the lungs has been previously demonstrated during experimental sepsis; however, the involvement of the γδ t cell subtype vγ <dig> has not been previously described.

methods
severe sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture  in male c57bl/ <dig> mice. γδ and vγ <dig> t lymphocyte depletion was performed by 3a <dig> and uc3-10a <dig> mab i.p. administration, respectively. lung infiltrating t lymphocytes, il- <dig> production and mortality rate were evaluated.


RESULTS
severe sepsis induced by clp in c57bl/ <dig> mice led to an intense lung inflammatory response, marked by the accumulation of γδ t lymphocytes . γδ t lymphocytes present in the lungs of clp mice were likely to be originated from peripheral lymphoid organs and migrated towards ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccl <dig>  which were highly produced in response to clp-induced sepsis. increased expression of cd <dig> by vγ <dig> t lymphocytes was observed in spleen earlier than that by αβ t cells, suggesting the early activation of vγ <dig> t cells. the vγ <dig> t lymphocyte subset predominated among the il-17+ cell populations present in the lungs of clp mice  and was strongly biased toward il- <dig> rather than toward ifn-γ production. accordingly, the in vivo administration of anti-vγ <dig> mab abrogated clp-induced il- <dig> production in mouse lungs. furthermore, anti-vγ <dig> mab treatment accelerated mortality rate in severe septic mice, demonstrating that vγ <dig> t lymphocyte play a beneficial role in host defense.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, our findings provide evidence that early-activated vγ <dig> t lymphocytes are the main responsible cells for il- <dig> production in inflamed lungs during the course of sepsis and delay mortality of septic mice.
