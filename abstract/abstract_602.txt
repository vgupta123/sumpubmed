BACKGROUND
burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, a frequently occurring disease in northeastern thailand, where soil and water high in salt content are common. using microarray analysis, we previously showed that b. pseudomallei up-regulated a short-chain dehydrogenase/oxidoreductase  under salt stress. however, the importance of sdo in b. pseudomallei infection is unknown. this study aimed to explore the function of b. pseudomallei sdo, and to investigate its role in interactions between b. pseudomallei and host cells.


RESULTS
bioinformatics analysis of b. pseudomallei sdo structure, based on homology modeling, revealed a nad+ cofactor domain and a catalytic triad containing ser <dig>  tyr <dig>  and lys <dig>  this is similar to bacillus megaterium glucose 1-dehydrogenase. to investigate the role of this protein, we constructed a b. pseudomallei sdo defective mutant, measured glucose dehydrogenase  activity, and tested the interactions with host cells. the b. pseudomallei k <dig> wild type exhibited potent gdh activity under condition containing 300Â mm nacl, while the mutant showed activity levels  <dig> times lower. both invasion into the a <dig> cell line and early intracellular survival within the j774a. <dig> macrophage cell were impaired in the mutant. complementation of sdo was able to restore the mutant ability to produce gdh activity, invade epithelial cells, and survive in macrophages.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that induced sdo activity during salt stress may facilitate b. pseudomallei invasion and affect initiation of successful intracellular infection. identifying the role of b. pseudomallei sdo provides a better understanding of the association between bacterial adaptation and pathogenesis in melioidosis.
