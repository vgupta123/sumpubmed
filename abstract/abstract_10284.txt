BACKGROUND
micrornas  are non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression by binding to the messenger rna  of protein coding genes. they control gene expression by either inhibiting translation or inducing mrna degradation. a number of computational techniques have been developed to identify the targets of mirnas. in this study we used predicted mirna-gene interactions to analyse mrna gene expression microarray data to predict mirnas associated with particular diseases or conditions.


RESULTS
here we combine correspondence analysis, between group analysis and co-inertia analysis  to determine which mirnas are associated with differences in gene expression levels in microarray data sets. using a database of mirna target predictions from targetscan, targetscans, pictar4way pictar5way, and miranda and combining these data with gene expression levels from sets of microarrays, this method produces a ranked list of mirnas associated with a specified split in samples. we applied this to three different microarray datasets, a papillary thyroid carcinoma dataset, an in-house dataset of lipopolysaccharide treated mouse macrophages, and a multi-tissue dataset. in each case we were able to identified mirnas of biological importance.


CONCLUSIONS
we describe a technique to integrate gene expression data and mirna target predictions from multiple sources.
