BACKGROUND
the natural interactions between plant roots and their rhizospheric microbiome are vital to plant fitness, modulating both growth promotion and disease suppression. in rice , a globally important food crop, as much as 30% of yields are lost due to blast disease caused by fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae. capitalizing on the abilities of naturally occurring rice soil bacteria to reduce m. oryzae infections could provide a sustainable solution to reduce the amount of crops lost to blast disease.


RESULTS
naturally occurring root-associated rhizospheric bacteria were isolated from california field grown rice plants , eleven of which were taxonomically identified by16s rrna gene sequencing and fatty acid methyl ester  analysis. bacterial isolates were tested for biocontrol activity against the devastating foliar rice fungal pathogen, m. oryzae pathovar 70â€“ <dig>  in vitro, a pseudomonas isolate, ea <dig>  displayed antibiosis through reducing appressoria formation by nearly 90% as well as directly inhibiting fungal growth by 76%. although hydrogen cyanide  is a volatile commonly produced by biocontrol pseudomonads, the activity of ea <dig> seems to be independent of its hcn production. during in planta experiments, ea <dig> reduced the number of blast lesions formed by 33% and pantoea agglomerans isolate, ea <dig> by 46%. our data also show both ea <dig> and ea <dig> trigger jasmonic acid  and ethylene  dependent induced systemic resistance  response in rice.


CONCLUSIONS
out of  <dig> bacteria isolated from rice soil, pseudomonad ea <dig> most effectively inhibited the growth and appressoria formation of m. oryzae through a mechanism that is independent of cyanide production. in addition to direct antagonism, ea <dig> also appears to trigger isr in rice plants through a mechanism that is dependent on ja and et signaling, ultimately resulting in fewer blast lesions. the application of native bacteria as biocontrol agents in combination with current disease protection strategies could aid in global food security.
