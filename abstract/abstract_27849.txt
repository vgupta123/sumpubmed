BACKGROUND
presently, few data exist on the level and duration of anti-protective antigen  igg in vaccinated livestock. various adaptation of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays  have been developed in studies to assess immune response following vaccination, albeit mostly in laboratory rodent models. the quantitative anti-anthrax igg elisa in this study describes a method of enumerating the concentration of anti-pa specific igg present in sera of immunized goats, with the aid of an affinity-purified caprine polyclonal anti-anthrax pa- <dig> igg standard. this was compared with the anthrax toxin neutralization assay  which measures a functional subset of toxin neutralizing anti-pa igg.


RESULTS
the measured concentrations obtained in the standard curve correlated with the known concentration at each dilution. percentage recovery of the standard concentrations ranged from  <dig> to 98% . mean correlation coefficient  of the standard curve was  <dig> . evaluation of the intra-assay coefficient of variation showed ranges of  <dig> - <dig> % and  <dig> - <dig> % for days  <dig> and  <dig> sera samples respectively, following vaccination. the mean inter-assay coefficient of variation for triplicate samples repeated on  <dig> different days was  <dig>  and  <dig> % for days  <dig> and  <dig> sera samples respectively. spearmanâ€™s rank correlation of log-transformed igg concentrations and tna titres showed strong positive correlation .


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides evidence that an indirect elisa can be used for the quantification of anti-anthrax pa igg in goats with the added advantage of using single dilutions to save time and resources. the use of such related immunoassays can serve as potential adjuncts to potency tests for sterne and other vaccine types under development in ruminant species. this is the first report on the correlation of polyclonal anti-anthrax pa <dig> antibody with the tna in goats.
