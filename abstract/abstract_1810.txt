BACKGROUND
the southern root-knot nematode  is one of the most important economic pests of upland cotton . host plant resistance, the ability of a plant to suppress nematode reproduction, is the most economical, practical, and environmentally sound method to provide protection against this subterranean pest. the resistant line auburn 623rnr and a number of elite breeding lines derived from it remain the most important source of root-knot nematode  resistance. prior genetic analysis has identified two epistatically interacting rkn resistance qtls, qmi-c <dig> and qmi-c <dig>  affecting gall formation and rkn reproduction, respectively.


RESULTS
we developed a genetic population segregating only for the qmi-c <dig> locus and evaluated the genetic effects of this qtl on rkn resistance in the absence of the qmi-c <dig> locus. the qmi-c <dig> locus had a lod score of  <dig> and accounted for  <dig>  % of total phenotypic variation for egg production. in addition to not being significantly associated with gall formation, this locus had a lower main effect on rkn reproduction than found in our previous study, which lends further support to evidence of epistasis with qmi-c <dig> in imparting rkn resistance in the auburn 623rnr source. the locus qmi-c <dig> was fine-mapped with the addition of  <dig> newly developed markers. by using the reference genome sequence of g. raimondii, we identified  <dig> candidate genes encoding disease resistance protein homologs in the newly defined  <dig>  mb region flanked by two ssr markers. resequencing of an rkn resistant and susceptible g. hirsutum germplasm revealed non-synonymous mutations in only four of the coding regions of candidate genes, and these four genes are consequently of high interest.


CONCLUSIONS
our mapping results validated the effects of the qmi-c <dig> resistance locus, delimiting the qtl to a smaller region, and identified tightly linked ssr markers to improve the efficiency of marker-assisted selection. the candidate genes identified warrant functional studies that will help in identifying and characterizing the actual qmi-c <dig> defense gene against root-knot nematodes.
