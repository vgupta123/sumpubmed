BACKGROUND
the white shark  is a globally distributed,
apex predator possessing physical, physiological, and behavioral traits that
have garnered it significant public attention. in addition to interest in
the genetic basis of its form and function, as a representative of the
oldest extant jawed vertebrate lineage, white sharks are also of
conservation concern due to their small population size and threat from
overfishing. despite this, surprisingly little is known about the biology of
white sharks, and genomic resources are unavailable. to address this
deficit, we combined roche- <dig> and illumina sequencing technologies to
characterize the first transciptome of any tissue for this species.


RESULTS
from white shark heart cdna we generated  <dig>  roche  <dig> reads  that were assembled into  <dig>  contigs . we also generated  <dig> , <dig> illumina reads, which we aligned to
the  <dig> contigs producing  <dig>  454/illumina consensus sequences. to
these, we added  <dig>  non-singleton  <dig> contigs. by comparing these
sequences to the uniprotkb/swiss-prot database we were able to annotate
 <dig>  translated open reading frames  of â‰¥  <dig> amino acids. of
these,  <dig>  were additionally assigned gene ontology  functional
annotations. while acknowledging the limitations of our single tissue
transcriptome, fisher tests showed the white shark transcriptome to be
significantly enriched for numerous metabolic go terms compared to the zebra
fish and human transcriptomes, with white shark showing more similarity to
human than to zebra fish . we
also compared the transcriptome to other available elasmobranch sequences,
for signatures of positive selection and identified several genes of
putative adaptive significance on the white shark lineage. the white shark
transcriptome also contained  <dig>  microsatellites .
detailed characterization of these microsatellites showed that orfs with
trinucleotide repeats, were significantly enriched for transcription
regulatory roles and that trinucleotide frequency within orfs was lower than
for a wide range of taxonomic groups including other vertebrates.


CONCLUSIONS
the white shark heart transcriptome represents a valuable resource for future
elasmobranch functional and comparative genomic studies, as well as for
population and other biological studies vital for effective conservation of
this globally vulnerable species.
