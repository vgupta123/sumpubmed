BACKGROUND
exogenous ngf or saline was delivered to the detrusor smooth muscle of female rats for a two-week period using osmotic mini-pumps. we then determined:  bladder function using conscious cystometry;  organization of micturition reflexes using fos protein expression in lumbosacral  spinal cord neurons;  calcitonin gene-related peptide -immunoreactivity  in lumbosacral spinal cord segments.

methods
an osmotic pump infused  <dig> % nacl  or ngf  for two weeks into the bladder wall. ngf bladder content was determined by enzyme-linked immunoassays. bladder function was assessed with conscious cystometry. immunohistochemical and imaging techniques were used to determine the distribution of fos-ir cells and cgrp expression in the l5-s <dig> spinal cord in saline and ngf-treated rats two hours after intravesical saline distention. fos expression and cgrp-ir in ngf-treated rats with bladder distention was compared to that observed in cyclophosphamide  treated rats with bladder distention.


RESULTS
two-week infusion of ngf into the bladder wall increased bladder weight, reduced bladder capacity , reduced the intercontraction interval  and increased the amplitude of non-voiding contractions. ngf treatment and intravesical saline distention  increased expression of fos protein in l6-s <dig> spinal cord and altered the distribution pattern of fos-ir cells. cgrp-ir in the lumbosacral spinal cord was also increased after ngf treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that ngf infusion into the bladder wall induces bladder overactivity, can reveal a "nociceptive" fos expression pattern in the spinal cord in response to a non-noxious bladder stimulus and increases cgrp-ir in the lumbosacral spinal cord.
