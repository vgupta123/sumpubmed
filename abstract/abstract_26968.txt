BACKGROUND
xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae  and x. oryzae pv. oryzicola  are bacterial pathogens of the worldwide staple and grass model, rice. xoo and xoc are closely related but xoo invades rice vascular tissue to cause bacterial leaf blight, a serious disease of rice in many parts of the world, and xoc colonizes the mesophyll parenchyma to cause bacterial leaf streak, a disease of emerging importance. both pathogens depend on hrp genes for type iii secretion to infect their host. we constructed a 50â€“ <dig> mer oligonucleotide microarray based on available genome data for xoo and xoc and compared gene expression in xoo strains pxo99a and xoc strain bls <dig> grown in the rich medium psb vs. xom <dig>  a minimal medium previously reported to induce hrp genes in xoo strain t <dig> 


RESULTS
three biological replicates of the microarray experiment to compare global gene expression in representative strains of xoo and xoc grown in psb vs. xom <dig> were carried out. the non-specific error rate and the correlation coefficients across biological replicates and among duplicate spots revealed that the microarray data were robust.  <dig> genes of xoo and  <dig> genes of xoc were differentially expressed in the two media with a false discovery rate of 5% and with a minimum fold-change of  <dig> . semi-quantitative-rt-pcr assays confirmed differential expression of each of  <dig> genes each for xoo and xoc selected for validation. the differentially expressed genes represent  <dig> functional categories.


CONCLUSIONS
we describe here the construction and validation of a two-genome microarray for the two pathovars of x. oryzae. microarray analysis revealed that using representative strains, a greater number of xoo genes than xoc genes are differentially expressed in xom <dig> relative to psb, and that these include hrp genes and other genes important in interactions with rice. an exception was the rax genes, which are required for production of the host resistance elicitor avrxa <dig>  and which were expressed constitutively in both pathovars.
