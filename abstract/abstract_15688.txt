BACKGROUND
as well known, both natural and synthetic steroidal compounds are powerful endocrine disrupting compounds  which can cause reproductive toxicity and affect cellular development in mammals and thus are generally regarded as serious contributors to water pollution. streptomyces virginiae ibl <dig> is an effective degradative strain for many steroidal compounds and can also catalyze the c <dig> hydroxylation of diosgenin, the first-ever biotransformation found on the f-ring of diosgenin.


RESULTS
to completely elucidate the hydroxylation function of cytochrome p <dig> genes  found during biotransformation of steroids by s. virginiae ibl <dig>  the whole genome sequencing of this strain was carried out via  <dig> sequencing systems. the analytical results of blastp showed that the strain ibl <dig> contains  <dig> cyps,  <dig> ferredoxins and  <dig> ferredoxin reductases in its  <dig>  mb linear chromosome. cyps from s. virginiae ibl <dig> are phylogenetically closed to those of streptomyces sp. mg <dig> and streptomyces sp. c. one new subfamily was found as per the fact that the cyp svu <dig> in s. virginiae ibl <dig> shares 66% identity only to that  from streptomyces sp. mg <dig>  further analysis showed that among all of the  <dig> cyps in s. virginiae ibl <dig>  three cyps are clustered with ferredoxins, one with ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase and three cyps with atp/gtp binding proteins, four cyps arranged with transcriptional regulatory genes and one cyp located on the upstream of an atp-binding protein and transcriptional regulators as well as four cyps associated with other functional genes involved in secondary metabolism and degradation.


CONCLUSIONS
these characteristics found in cyps from s. virginiae ibl <dig> show that the exxr motif in the k-helix is not absolutely conserved in cyp <dig> family and i-helix not absolutely essential for the cyp structure, too. experimental results showed that both cyp svh <dig> and cyp svu <dig> are two hydroxylases, capable of bioconverting diosgenone into isonuatigenone and β-estradiol into estriol, respectively.
