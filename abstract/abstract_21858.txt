BACKGROUND
in yeast, dna damage leads to the mono and polyubiquitination of the sliding clamp pcna. monoubiquitination of pcna is controlled by rad <dig>  and rad <dig> , while the extension of the monoubiquitinated pcna into a polyubiquitinated substrate is governed by rad <dig>  and the heterodimer of ubc13/mms <dig>  each modification directs a different branch of the dna damage tolerance pathway . while pcna monoubiquitination leads to error-prone bypass via tls, biochemical studies have identified mms <dig> along with its heteromeric partner ubc <dig> to govern the error-free repair of dna lesions by catalyzing the formation of lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains . recently, it was shown that pcna polyubiquitination is conserved in human cells and that this modification is dependent on rad <dig>  ubc <dig> and shprh. however, the role of hmms <dig> in this process was not specifically addressed.


RESULTS
in this report we show that mammalian cells in which mms <dig> was reduced by sirna-mediated knockdown maintains pcna polyubiquitination while a knockdown of rad <dig> or ubc <dig> abrogates pcna ubiquitination. moreover, the additional knockdown of a uev1a  does not deplete pcna polyubiquitination. finally, mouse embryonic stem cells null for mms <dig> with or without the additional depletion of muev1a continue to polyubiquitinated pcna with normal kinetics.


CONCLUSIONS
our results point to a high level of redundancy in the ddt pathway and suggest the existence of another hmms <dig> variant  or complex that can compensate for its loss.
