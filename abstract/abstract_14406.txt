BACKGROUND
females can potentially assess the quality of potential mates using their secondary sexual traits, and obtain "good genes" that increase offspring fitness. another potential indirect benefit from mating preferences is genetic compatibility, which does not require extravagant or viability indicator traits. several studies with mammals and fish indicate that the genes of the major histocompatibility complex  influence olfactory cues and mating preferences, and such preferences confer genetic benefits to offspring. we investigated whether individual mhc diversity  influences mating preferences in house sparrows .


RESULTS
overall, we found no evidence that females preferred males with high individual mhc diversity. yet, when we considered individual mhc allelic diversity of the females, we found that females with a low number of alleles were most attracted to males carrying a high number of mhc alleles, which might reflect a mating-up preference by allele counting.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first experimental evidence for mhc-dependent mating preferences in an avian species to our knowledge. our findings raise questions about the underlying mechanisms through which birds discriminate individual mhc diversity among conspecifics, and they suggest a novel mechanism through which mating preferences might promote the evolution of mhc polymorphisms and generate positive selection for duplicated mhc loci.
