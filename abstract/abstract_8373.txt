BACKGROUND
idiopathic cervical dystonia is characterized by involuntary spasms, tremors or jerks. it is not restricted to a disturbance in the basal ganglia system because non-conventional voxel-based mri morphometry  and diffusion tensor imaging  have detected numerous regional changes in the brains of patients.

in this study scans of  <dig> patients with cervical dystonia and  <dig> age-and sex-matched controls were analysed using vbm, dti and magnetization transfer imaging  using a voxel-based approach and a region-of-interest analysis. results were correlated with udrs, twstrs and disease duration.


RESULTS
we found structural alterations in the basal ganglia; thalamus; motor cortex; premotor cortex; frontal, temporal and parietal cortices; visual system; cerebellum and brainstem of the patients with dystonia.


CONCLUSIONS
cervical dystonia is a multisystem disease involving several networks such as the motor, sensory and visual systems.
