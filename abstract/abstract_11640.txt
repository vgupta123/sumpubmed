BACKGROUND
arabidopsis thaliana is the main model species for plant molecular genetics studies and world-wide efforts are devoted to identify the function of all its genes. to this end, reverse genetics by tilling  in a permanent collection of chemically induced mutants is providing a unique resource in columbia genetic background. in this work, we aim to extend tilling resources available in a. thaliana by developing a new population of ethyl methanesulphonate  induced mutants in the second commonest reference strain. in addition, we pursue to saturate the number of ems induced mutations that can be tolerated by viable and fertile plants.


RESULTS
by mutagenizing with different ems concentrations we have developed a permanent collection of  <dig> m2/m <dig> independent mutant lines in the reference strain landsberg erecta  of a. thaliana. this population has been named as the arabidopsis tiller collection. the frequency of mutations per line was maximized by using m <dig> plants with low but sufficient seed fertility. application of tilling to search for mutants in  <dig> genes identified  <dig> to  <dig> mutations per gene, which correspond to a total of  <dig> mutations. missense mutations were found for all genes while truncations were selected for all except one. we estimated that, on average, these lines carry one mutation every  <dig> kb, ler population providing a total of more than five million induced mutations. it is estimated that tiller collection shows a two to three fold higher ems mutation density per individual than previously reported a. thaliana population.


CONCLUSIONS
analysis of tiller collection demonstrates its usefulness for large scale tilling reverse genetics in another reference genetic background of a. thaliana. comparisons with tilling populations in other organisms indicate that this new a. thaliana collection carries the highest chemically induced mutation density per individual known in diploid species.
