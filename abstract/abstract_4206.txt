BACKGROUND
lactobacillus fermentum  <dig> and lactobacillus plantarum  <dig>  isolates from a spontaneous ghanaian cocoa bean fermentation process, proved to be interesting functional starter culture strains for cocoa bean fermentations. lactobacillus fermentum  <dig> is a thermotolerant strain, able to dominate the fermentation process, thereby converting citrate and producing mannitol. lactobacillus plantarum  <dig> is an acid-tolerant and facultative heterofermentative strain that is competitive during cocoa bean fermentation processes. in this study, whole-genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis was used to investigate the mechanisms of these strains to dominate the cocoa bean fermentation process.


RESULTS
through functional annotation and analysis of the high-coverage contigs obtained through  <dig> pyrosequencing, plantaricin production was predicted for l. plantarum  <dig>  for l. fermentum  <dig>  genes encoding a complete arginine deiminase pathway were attributed. further, in-depth functional analysis revealed the capacities of these strains associated with carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, such as the ability to use alternative external electron acceptors, the presence of an extended pyruvate metabolism, and the occurrence of several amino acid conversion pathways. a comparative genome sequence analysis using publicly available genome sequences of strains of the species l. plantarum and l. fermentum revealed unique features of both strains studied. indeed, l. fermentum  <dig> possessed genes encoding additional citrate transporters and enzymes involved in amino acid conversions, whereas l. plantarum  <dig> is the only member of this species that harboured a gene cluster involved in uptake and consumption of fructose and/or sorbose.


CONCLUSIONS
in-depth genome sequence analysis of the candidate functional starter culture strains l. fermentum  <dig> and l. plantarum  <dig> revealed their metabolic capacities, niche adaptations and functionalities that enable them to dominate the cocoa bean fermentation process. further, these results offered insights into the cocoa bean fermentation ecosystem as a whole and will facilitate the selection of appropriate starter culture strains for controlled cocoa bean fermentation processes.
