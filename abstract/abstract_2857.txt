BACKGROUND
the usda, wildlife services cooperative oral rabies vaccination  program uses a live vaccinia virus-vectored  vaccine, raboral v-rgÂ® , to vaccinate specific wildlife species against rabies virus in several regions of the u.s. several naturally occurring orthopoxviruses have been found in north america, including one isolated from asymptomatic raccoons . the effect of naturally occurring antibodies to orthopoxviruses on successful v-rg vaccination in raccoons is the focus of this study.


RESULTS
overall, raccoons pre-immunized  with a recombinant raccoonpox virus vaccine  responded to vaccination with v-rg with lower rabies virus neutralizing antibody  titers than those which were not pre-immunized  and some failed to seroconvert for rabies vna to detectable levels.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that the success of some orv campaigns may be hindered where raccoonpox virus or possibly other orthopoxvirus antibodies are common in wildlife species targeted for orv. if these areas are identified, different vaccination strategies may be warranted.
