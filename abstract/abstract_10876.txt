BACKGROUND
orphan nuclear receptor estrogen related receptor β  is well known in stem cells and early embryonic development. however, little is known about its function in cancer.

method
we investigated the mrna profile alterations induced by esrrb expression and its synthetic ligand dy <dig> in human prostate cancer du <dig> cells via rna-seq analysis.


RESULTS
we distinguished  <dig> mrnas differentially expressed by esrrb alone. although dy <dig> alone did not change any gene, treatment of dy <dig> in the presence of esrrb altered  <dig> mrnas. these observations indicated esrrb had both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent activity. when esrrb was expressed, dy <dig> treatment further regulated  <dig> esrrb-altered mrnas. dy <dig> acted as an antagonist for  <dig> of  <dig> mrnas  and as an agonist for  <dig> of the  <dig> mrnas . gene ontology analyses showed altered genes are related to transcription and translation regulation, cell proliferation and apoptosis regulation, and cellular metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
our results characterized mrna profiles in du <dig> prostate cancer cells driven by esrrb expression and esrrb ligand dy <dig>  and provided multiple markers to characterize esrrb’s function in esrrb research.
