BACKGROUND
micrornas  are endogenous regulators of a broad range of physiological processes and act by either degrading mrna or blocking its translation. oilseed rape  is one of the most important crops in china, europe and other asian countries with publicly available expressed sequence tags  and genomic survey sequence  databases, but little is known about its mirnas and their targets. to date, only  <dig> mirnas have been identified in b. napus.


RESULTS
forty-one conserved and  <dig> brassica-specific candidate b. napus mirnas, including  <dig> mirna* sequences, were identified using solexa sequencing technology. furthermore,  <dig> non-redundant mrna targets of conserved brassica mirnas and  <dig> new non-redundant mrna targets of novel brassica-specific mirnas were identified by genome-scale sequencing of mrna degradome.


CONCLUSIONS
this study describes large scale cloning and characterization of b. napus mirnas and their potential targets, providing the foundation for further characterization of mirna function in the regulation of diverse physiological processes in b. napus.
