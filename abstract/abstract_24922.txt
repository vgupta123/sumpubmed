BACKGROUND
cells expose phosphatidylserine during apoptosis. the voltage across the plasma membrane also decreases or disappears during apoptosis, but the physiological significance of this is unknown.


RESULTS
here we show that transmembrane potential regulates membrane binding of two unrelated proteins that recognize exposed phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells. in jurkat t leukemia cells and k <dig> promyelocytic leukemia cells undergoing apoptosis, extracellular binding of annexin v was increased by decreasing membrane potential in a dose-dependent manner. studies with phospholipid vesicles showed that the effect was mediated via an increase in binding affinity. the effect was independent of the apoptotic stimulus. the same phenomenon occurred with lactadherin, a structurally unrelated protein that also binds to apoptotic cells via phosphatidylserine and is essential for in vivo clearance of dying cells.


CONCLUSIONS
alterations in membrane potential regulate the binding of annexin v and lactadherin to cell membranes, and may also influence the membrane binding of other classes of phosphatidylserine-binding proteins.
