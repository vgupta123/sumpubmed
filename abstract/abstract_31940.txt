BACKGROUND
pathogen identification in clinical routine is based on the cultivation of microbes with subsequent morphological and physiological characterisation lasting at least  <dig> hours. however, early and accurate identification is a crucial requisite for fast and optimally targeted antimicrobial treatment. molecular biology based techniques allow fast identification, however discrimination of very closely related species remains still difficult.


RESULTS
a molecular approach is presented for the rapid identification of pathogens combining pcr amplification with microarray detection. the dna chip comprises oligonucleotide capture probes for  <dig> different pathogens including gram positive cocci, the most frequently encountered genera of enterobacteriaceae, non-fermenter and clinical relevant candida species. the observed detection limits varied from  <dig> cells  to  <dig> cells  per ml artificially spiked blood. thus the current low sensitivity for some species still represents a barrier for clinical application. successful discrimination of closely related species was achieved by a signal pattern recognition approach based on the k-nearest-neighbour method. a prototype software providing this statistical evaluation was developed, allowing correct identification in  <dig> % of the cases at the genus and in  <dig>  % at the species level .


CONCLUSIONS
the newly developed molecular assay can be carried out within  <dig> hours in a research laboratory from pathogen isolation to species identification. from our results we conclude that dna microarrays can be a useful tool for rapid identification of closely related pathogens particularly when the protocols are adapted to the special clinical scenarios.
