BACKGROUND
the v-atpase  is a protein complex of  <dig> different vha-subunits. it functions as an atp driven rotary-motor that electrogenically translocates h+ into endomembrane compartments. in arabidopsis thaliana v-atpase is encoded by  <dig> genes posing the question of specific versus redundant function of multigene encoded isoforms.


RESULTS
the transmembrane topology and stoichiometry of the proteolipid vha-c" as well as the stoichiometry of the membrane integral subunit vha-e within the v-atpase complex were investigated by in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer . vha-c", vha-e <dig> and vha-e <dig>  vha-a, vha-c <dig>  truncated variants of vha-c <dig> and a chimeric vha-c/vha-c" hybrid were fused to cyan  and yellow fluorescent protein , respectively. the constructs were employed for transfection experiments with arabidopsis thaliana mesophyll protoplasts. subcellular localization and fret analysis by confocal laser scanning microscopy  demonstrated that  the n- and c-termini of vha-c" are localised in the vacuolar lumen,  one copy of vha-c" is present within the vha-complex, and  vha-c" is localised at the er and associated golgi bodies.  a similar localisation was observed for vha-e <dig>  whereas  the subcellular localisation of vha-e <dig> indicated the trans golgi network -specifity of this subunit.


CONCLUSIONS
the plant proteolipid ring is a highly flexible protein subcomplex, tolerating the incorporation of truncated and hybrid proteolipid subunits, respectively. whereas the membrane integral subunit vha-e is present in two copies within the complex, the proteolipid subunit vha-c" takes part in complex formation with only one copy. however, neither vha-c" isoform  <dig> nor any of the two vha-e isoforms were identified at the tonoplast. this suggest a function in endomembrane specific vha-assembly or targeting rather than proton transport.
