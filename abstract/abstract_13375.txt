BACKGROUND
the expansion of adipose tissue is linked to the development of its vasculature, which appears to have the potential to regulate the onset of obesity. however, at present, there are no studies highlighting the relationship between human adipose tissue angiogenesis and obesity-associated insulin resistance .


RESULTS
our aim was to analyze and compare angiogenic factor expression levels in both subcutaneous  and omentum  adipose tissues from morbidly obese patients  with low   and high  degrees of ir, and lean controls . another objective was to examine angiogenic factor correlations with obesity and ir.

here we found that vegf-a was the isoform with higher expression in both om and sc adipose tissues, and was up-regulated 3-fold, together with mmp <dig> in ob/l-ir as compared to leans. this up-regulation decreased by 23% in ob/-h-ir compared to ob/l-ir. on the contrary, vegf-b, vegf-c and vegf-d, together with mmp <dig> was down-regulated in both ob/h-ir and ob/l-ir compared to lean patients. moreover, mmp <dig> correlated positively and vegf-c, vegf-d and mmp <dig> correlated negatively with homa-ir, in both sc and om.


CONCLUSIONS
we hereby propose that the alteration in mmp <dig>  vegf-b, vegf-c and vegf-d gene expression may be caused by one of the relevant adipose tissue processes related to the development of ir, and the up-regulation of vegf-a in adipose tissue could have a relationship with the prevention of this pathology.
