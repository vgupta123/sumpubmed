BACKGROUND
in primates, infection is an important force driving gene evolution, and this is reflected in the importance of infectious disease in human morbidity today. the beta-defensins are key components of the innate immune system, with antimicrobial and cell signalling roles, but also reproductive functions. here we examine evolution of beta-defensins in catarrhine primates and variation within different human populations.


RESULTS
we show that five beta-defensin genes that do not show copy number variation in humans show evidence of positive selection in catarrhine primates, and identify specific codons that have been under selective pressure. direct haplotyping of defb <dig> in humans suggests long-term balancing selection: there are two highly diverged haplotype clades carrying different variants of a codon that, in primates, is positively selected. for defb <dig>  we show that extensive diversity, including a four-state amino acid polymorphism , is present in hunter-gatherer populations, both african and non-african, but not found in samples from agricultural populations.


CONCLUSIONS
some, but not all, beta-defensin genes show positive selection in catarrhine primates. there is suggestive evidence of different selective pressures on these genes in humans, but the nature of the selective pressure remains unclear and is likely to differ between populations.
