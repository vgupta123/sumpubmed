BACKGROUND
half-smooth tongue sole  is a valuable fish for aquaculture in china. this fish exhibits sexual dimorphism, particularly different growth rates and body sizes between two genders. thus, c. semilaevis is a good model that can be used to investigate mechanisms responsible for such dimorphism, this model can also be utilized to answer fundamental questions in evolution and applied fields of aquaculture. hence, advances in second-generation sequencing technology, such as  <dig> pyrosequencing, could provide a robust tool to study the genome characteristics of non-model species.


RESULTS
in this study, c. semilaevis was subjected to de novo transcriptome sequencing and characterization. a total of  <dig>  reads were generated using a single  <dig> sequencing run in a full picotiter plate. these reads were then assembled into  <dig>  contigs with a 10-fold average sequencing coverage. a total of  <dig>  sequences were successfully annotated based on sequence similarities; among these sequences,  <dig>  transcripts exhibited gene ontology terms and  <dig>  showed enzyme commissions associated with  <dig> pathways from kyoto encyclopedia of gene and genomes pathways. a search of repetitive elements was performed, and  <dig>  transposable elements were identified. approximately  <dig>  simple-sequence repeats and  <dig>  single-nucleotide polymorphisms were also detected.


CONCLUSIONS
our data provided an integrated and comprehensive transcriptome resource for c. semilaevis. these data could be used for further research in population genetics, gene function, and tissue-specific gene expressions.
