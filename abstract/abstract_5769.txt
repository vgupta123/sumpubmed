BACKGROUND
the p <dig> tumor suppressor protein is mainly regulated by alterations in the half-life of the protein, resulting in significant differences in p <dig> protein levels in cells. the major regulator of this process is mdm <dig>  which ubiquitinates p <dig> and targets it for proteasomal degradation. this process can be enhanced or reduced by proteins that associate with p <dig> or mdm <dig> and several proteins have been identified with such an activity. furthermore, additional ubiquitin ligases for p <dig> have been identified in recent years. nevertheless, our understanding of how p <dig> abundance and mdm <dig> activity are regulated remains incomplete. here we describe a cell culture based overexpression screen to identify evolutionarily conserved regulators of the p53/mdm <dig> circuit. the results from this large-scale screening method will contribute to a better understanding of the regulation of these important proteins.

methods
expression screening was based on co-transfection of h <dig> cells with pools of cdna’s from a medaka library together with p <dig>  mdm <dig> and, as internal control, ror <dig>  after cell lysis, sds-page/wb analysis was used to detect alterations in these proteins.


RESULTS
more than one hundred hits that altered the abundance of either p <dig>  mdm <dig>  or both were identified in the primary screen. subscreening of the library pools that were identified in the primary screen identified several potential novel regulators of p <dig> and/or mdm <dig>  we also tested whether the human orthologues of the medaka genes regulate p <dig> and/or mdm <dig> abundance. all human orthologues regulated p <dig> and/or mdm <dig> abundance in the same manner as the proteins from medaka, which underscores the suitability of this screening methodology for the identification of new modifiers of p <dig> and mdm <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
despite enormous efforts in the last two decades, many unknown regulators for p <dig> and mdm <dig> abundance are predicted to exist. this cross-species approach to identify evolutionarily conserved regulators demonstrates that our medaka unigene cdna library represents a powerful tool to screen for these novel regulators of the p53/mdm <dig> pathway.
