BACKGROUND
arginine is a conditionally essential amino acid important in growing individuals and under non-homeostatic conditions/disease. many pathogens interfere with arginine-utilization in host cells, especially nitric oxide  production, by changing the expression of host enzymes involved in arginine metabolism. here we used human intestinal epithelial cells  and three different isolates of the protozoan parasite giardia intestinalis to investigate the role of arginine and arginine-metabolizing enzymes during intestinal protozoan infections.


RESULTS
rna expression analyses of major arginine-metabolizing enzymes revealed the arginine-utilizing pathways in human iecs  grown in vitro. most genes were constant or down-regulated  upon interaction with giardia, whereas inducible no synthase  and ornithine decarboxylase  were up-regulated within 6 h of infection. giardia was shown to suppress cytokine-induced inos expression, thus the parasite has both inos inducing and suppressive activities. giardial arginine consumption suppresses no production and the no-degrading parasite protein flavohemoglobin is up-regulated in response to host no. in addition, the secreted, arginine-consuming giardial enzyme arginine deiminase  actively reduces t-cell proliferation in vitro. interestingly, the effects on no production and t cell proliferation could be reversed by addition of external arginine or citrulline.


CONCLUSIONS
giardia affects the host’s arginine metabolism on many different levels. many of the effects can be reversed by addition of arginine or citrulline, which could be a beneficial supplement in oral rehydration therapy.
