BACKGROUND
dna methylation has been shown to play an important role in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes in various tumor types. in order to have a system-wide understanding of the methylation changes that occur in tumors, we have developed a differential methylation hybridization  protocol that can simultaneously assay the methylation status of all known cpg islands  using microarray technologies. a large percentage of signals obtained from microarrays can be attributed to various measurable and unmeasurable confounding factors unrelated to the biological question at hand. in order to correct the bias due to noise, we first implemented a quantile regression model, with a quantile level equal to 75%, to identify hypermethylated cgis in an earlier work. as a proof of concept, we applied this model to methylation microarray data generated from breast cancer cell lines. however, we were unsure whether 75% was the best quantile level for identifying hypermethylated cgis. in this paper, we attempt to determine which quantile level should be used to identify hypermethylated cgis and their associated genes.


RESULTS
we introduce three statistical measurements to compare the performance of the proposed quantile regression model at different quantile levels , using known methylated genes and unmethylated housekeeping genes reported in breast cancer cell lines and ovarian cancer patients. our results show that the quantile levels ranging from 80% to 90% are better at identifying known methylated and unmethylated genes.


CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we propose to use a quantile regression model to identify hypermethylated cgis by incorporating probe effects to account for noise due to unmeasurable factors. our model can efficiently identify hypermethylated cgis in both breast and ovarian cancer data.
