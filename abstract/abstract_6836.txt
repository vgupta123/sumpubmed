BACKGROUND
in yeast, glucose-dependent degradation of the mth <dig> protein, a corepressor of the glucose transporter gene  repressor rgt <dig>  is a crucial event enabling expression of several hxt. this event occurs through a signaling pathway that involves the rgt <dig> and snf <dig> glucose sensors and yeast casein kinase  <dig> and  <dig> . in this study, we examined whether the glucose sensors directly couple with yck1/ <dig> to convert glucose binding into an intracellular signal that leads to the degradation of mth <dig> 


RESULTS
high levels of glucose induce degradation of mth <dig> through the rgt2/snf <dig> glucose signaling pathway. fluorescence microscopy analysis indicates that, under glucose-limited conditions, gfp-mth <dig> is localized in the nucleus and does not shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. if glucose-induced degradation is prevented due to disruption of the rgt2/snf <dig> pathway, gfp-mth <dig> accumulates in the nucleus. when engineered to be localized to the cytoplasm, gfp-mth <dig> is degraded regardless of the presence of glucose or the glucose sensors. in addition, removal of grr <dig> from the nucleus prevents degradation of gfp-mth <dig>  these results suggest that glucose-induced, glucose sensor-dependent mth <dig> degradation occurs in the nucleus. we also show that, like yck <dig>  yck <dig> is localized to the plasma membrane via c-terminal palmitoylation mediated by the palmitoyl transferase akr <dig>  however, glucose-dependent degradation of mth <dig> is not impaired in the absence of akr <dig>  suggesting that a direct interaction between the glucose sensors and yck1/ <dig> is not required for mth <dig> degradation.


CONCLUSIONS
glucose-induced, glucose sensor-regulated degradation of mth <dig> occurs in the nucleus and does not require direct interaction of the glucose sensors with yck1/ <dig>
