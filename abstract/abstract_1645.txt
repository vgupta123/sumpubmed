BACKGROUND
vinyl chloride is a widespread groundwater pollutant and group  <dig> carcinogen. a previous comparative genomic analysis revealed that the vinyl chloride reductase operon, vcrabc, of dehalococcoides sp. strain vs is embedded in a horizontally-acquired genomic island that integrated at the single-copy tmrna gene, ssra.


RESULTS
we targeted conserved positions in available genomic islands to amplify and sequence four additional vcrabc -containing genomic islands from previously-unsequenced vinyl chloride respiring dehalococcoides enrichments. we identified a total of  <dig> ssra-specific genomic islands from dehalococcoides genomic data, accounting for  <dig> reductive dehalogenase homologous genes and many other non-core genes. sixteen of these genomic islands contain a syntenic module of integration-associated genes located adjacent to the predicted site of integration, and among these islands, eight contain vcrabc as genetic 'cargo'. these eight vcrabc -containing genomic islands are syntenic across their ~ <dig> kbp length, but have two phylogenetically discordant segments that unambiguously differentiate the integration module from the vcrabc cargo. using available dehalococcoides phylogenomic data we estimate that these ssra-specific genomic islands are at least as old as the dehalococcoides group itself, which in turn is much older than human civilization.


CONCLUSIONS
the vcrabc -containing genomic islands are a recently-acquired subset of a diverse collection of ssra-specific mobile elements that are a major contributor to strain-level diversity in dehalococcoides, and may have been throughout its evolution. the high similarity between vcrabc sequences is quantitatively consistent with recent horizontal acquisition driven by ~ <dig> years of industrial pollution with chlorinated ethenes.
