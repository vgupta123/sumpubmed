BACKGROUND
modeling and simulation of cellular signaling and metabolic pathways as networks of biochemical reactions yields sets of non-linear ordinary differential equations. these models usually depend on several parameters and initial conditions. if these parameters are unknown, results from simulation studies can be misleading. such a scenario can be avoided by fitting the model to experimental data before analyzing the system. this involves parameter estimation which is usually performed by minimizing a cost function which quantifies the difference between model predictions and measurements. mathematically, this is formulated as a non-linear optimization problem which often results to be multi-modal , rendering local optimization methods detrimental.


RESULTS
in this work we propose a new hybrid global method, based on the combination of an evolutionary search strategy with a local multiple-shooting approach, which offers a reliable and efficient alternative for the solution of large scale parameter estimation problems.


CONCLUSIONS
the presented new hybrid strategy offers two main advantages over previous approaches: first, it is equipped with a switching strategy which allows the systematic determination of the transition from the local to global search. this avoids computationally expensive tests in advance. second, using multiple-shooting as the local search procedure reduces the multi-modality of the non-linear optimization problem significantly. because multiple-shooting avoids possible spurious solutions in the vicinity of the global optimum it often outperforms the frequently used initial value approach . thereby, the use of multiple-shooting yields an enhanced robustness of the hybrid approach.
