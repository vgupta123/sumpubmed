BACKGROUND
in the genome of caenorhabditis elegans, homopolymeric poly-g/poly-c tracts  exist at high frequency and are maintained by the activity of the dog- <dig> protein. the frequency and distribution of g/c tracts in the genomes of c. elegans and the related nematode, c. briggsae were analyzed to investigate possible biological roles for g/c tracts.


RESULTS
in c. elegans, g/c tracts are distributed along every chromosome in a non-random pattern. most g/c tracts are within introns or are close to genes. analysis of sage data showed that g/c tracts correlate with the levels of regional gene expression in c. elegans. g/c tracts are over-represented and dispersed across all chromosomes in another caenorhabditis species, c. briggsae. however, the positions and distribution of g/c tracts in c. briggsae differ from those in c. elegans. furthermore, the c. briggsae dog- <dig> ortholog cbg <dig> can rescue the mutator phenotype of c. elegans dog- <dig> mutants.


CONCLUSIONS
the abundance and genomic distribution of g/c tracts in c. elegans, the effect of g/c tracts on regional transcription levels, and the lack of positional conservation of g/c tracts in c. briggsae suggest a role for g/c tracts in chromatin structure but not in the transcriptional regulation of specific genes.
