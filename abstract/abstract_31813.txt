BACKGROUND
oilseed germination is characterized by the degradation of storage lipids. it may proceed either via the direct action of a triacylglycerol lipase, or in certain plant species via a specific lipid body 13-lipoxygenase. for the involvement of a lipoxygenase previous results suggested that the hydroxy- or oxo-group that is being introduced into the fatty acid backbone by this lipoxygenase forms a barrier to continuous β-oxidation.


RESULTS
this study shows however that a complete degradation of oxygenated fatty acids is possible by isolated cucumber and sunflower glyoxysomes. interestingly, degradation is accompanied by the formation of saturated short chain acyl-coas with chain length between  <dig> and  <dig> carbon atoms lacking the hydroxy- or oxo-diene system of the oxygenated fatty acid substrate. the presence of these coa esters suggests the involvement of a specific reduction of the diene system at a chain length of  <dig> carbon atoms including conversion of the hydroxy-group at c <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge this metabolic pathway has not been described for the degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids so far. it may represent a new principle to degrade oxygenated fatty acid derivatives formed by lipoxygenases or chemical oxidation initiated by reactive oxygen species.
