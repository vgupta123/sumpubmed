BACKGROUND
the prolactin-related proteins  are non-classical placental-specific members of the  prolactin/growth hormone family. among ruminants, they are expressed in the cotyledonary villi of cattle and goat. we investigated placental prp in sheep in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the function and evolution of these molecules. we also examined the sequence properties, expression and lactogenic activation of the cloned genes.


RESULTS
we cloned two novel ovine prps, named oprp <dig> and oprp <dig>  oprp <dig> had a typical prp sequence similar to bovine prp <dig> . oprp <dig> had a short sequence identical with bovine or caprine type prp but the reading frame was shifted. both oprps were expressed in trophoblast giant binucleate cells  as in cattle and goat. oprp <dig> expression declined from the early to the middle stage of gestation. in contrast, oprp <dig> expression remained constant throughout the gestation period. oprp <dig> was translated to form a mature protein in a mammalian cell expression system. western blotting showed a molecular mass of  <dig> kda for the flag-tag fusion oprp <dig> protein. this recombinant protein and bprp <dig> were bioassayed using nb <dig> lymphoma cells; it was confirmed that neither ruminant prp had lactogenic activity because the nb <dig> lymphoma cells did not proliferate.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified two novel prps, oprp <dig> and oprp <dig>  in ovine placenta. both these ovine prps were localized and quantitatively expressed in bnc. absence of lactogenic activity was confirmed for the oprp <dig> molecule. it is anticipated that novel and known ruminant prps have common functions, except for lactogenic activity.
