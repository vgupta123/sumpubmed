BACKGROUND
plant root exudates have been shown to play an important role in mediating interactions between plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria  and their host plants. most investigations were performed on gram-negative rhizobacteria, while much less is known about gram-positive rhizobacteria. to elucidate early responses of pgpr to root exudates, we investigated changes in the transcriptome of a gram-positive pgpr to plant root exudates.


RESULTS
bacillus amyloliquefaciens fzb <dig> is a well-studied gram-positive pgpr. to obtain a comprehensive overview of fzb <dig> gene expression in response to maize root exudates, microarray experiments were performed. a total of  <dig> genes representing  <dig> % of the fzb <dig> transcriptome showed significantly altered expression levels in the presence of root exudates. the majority of the genes  was up-regulated after incubation of fzb <dig> with root exudates, whereas only  <dig> genes were down-regulated. several groups of the genes which were strongly induced by the root exudates are involved in metabolic pathways relating to nutrient utilization, bacterial chemotaxis and motility, and non-ribosomal synthesis of antimicrobial peptides and polyketides.


CONCLUSIONS
here we present a transcriptome analysis of the root-colonizing bacterium bacillus amyloliquefaciens fzb <dig> in response to maize root exudates. the  <dig> genes identified as being differentially transcribed are proposed to be involved in interactions of gram-positive bacteria with plants.
