BACKGROUND
protein transduction is safer than viral vector-mediated transduction for the delivery of a therapeutic protein into a cell. fusion proteins with an arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide have been produced in e. coli, but the low solubility of the fusion protein expressed in e. coli impedes the large-scale production of fusion proteins from e. coli.


RESULTS
expressed protein ligation is a semisynthetic method to ligate a bacterially expressed protein with a chemically synthesized peptide. in this study, we developed expressed protein ligation-based techniques to conjugate synthetic polyarginine peptides to cre recombinase. the conjugation efficiency of this technique was higher than 80%. using this method, we prepared semisynthetic cre with poly-l-arginine , poly-d-arginine  and biotin . we found that sscre-r <dig> was delivered to the cell to a comparable level or more efficiently compared with cre-r <dig> and tat-cre expressed as recombinant fusion proteins in e. coli. we also found that the poly-d-arginine cell-penetrating peptide was more effective than the poly-l-arginine cell-penetrating peptide for the delivery of cre into cell. we visualized the cell transduced with sscre-dr9-biotin using avidin-fitc.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, the results demonstrate that expressed protein ligation is an excellent technique for the production of cell-permeable cre recombinase with polyarginine cell-penetrating peptides. in addition, this approach will extend the use of cell-permeable proteins to more sophisticated applications, such as cell imaging.
