BACKGROUND
human memory cd4+ t cells can be either cd300a/c+ or cd300a/c- and subsequent analyses showed that cd4+ effector memory t  cells are mostly cd300a/c+, whereas cd4+ central memory t  cells have similar frequencies of cd300a/c+ and cd300a/c- cells.


RESULTS
extensive phenotypical and functional characterization showed that in both tcm and tem cells, the cd300a/c+ subset contained a higher number of th <dig>  cells. alternatively, th <dig>  cells tend to be cd300a/c-, especially in the tem subset. further characterization of the il-17a+ cells showed that cells that produce only this cytokine are mostly cd300a/c-, while cells that produce il-17a in combination with other cytokines, especially ifn-γ, are mostly cd300a/c+, indicating that the expression of this receptor is associated with cells that produce ifn-γ. co-ligation of the tcr and cd300a/c in cd4+ t cells inhibited ca2+ mobilization evoked by tcr ligation alone and modulated ifn-γ production on th <dig> polarized cells.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the cd300a/c receptors are differentially expressed on human th <dig> and th <dig> cells and that their ligation is capable of modulating tcr mediated signals.
