BACKGROUND
the study describes the application of the pcr method for the simultaneous detection of dna of gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, yeast fungi and filamentous fungi in blood and, thus, a whole range of microbial etiological agents that may cause sepsis. material for the study was sterile blood inoculated with four species of microorganisms  and blood collected from patients with clinical symptoms of sepsis. the developed method is based on nested-multiplex real-time pcr .


RESULTS
analysis of the obtained data shows that sensitivity of nested-multiplex real-time pcr remained at the level of 101Â cfu/ml for each of the four studied species of microorganisms and the percentage of positive results of the examined blood samples from the patients was 70% and 19% for the microbiological culture method. the designed primers correctly typed the studied species as belonging to the groups of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, yeast fungi, or filamentous fungi.


CONCLUSIONS
results obtained by us indicated that the designed pcr methods:  allow to detect bacteria in whole blood samples,  are much more sensitive than culture method,  allow differentiation of the main groups of microorganisms within a few hours.
