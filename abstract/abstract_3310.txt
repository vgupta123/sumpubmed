BACKGROUND
the gii. <dig> sydney  <dig> strain of human norovirus  is a pandemic strain that is responsible for the majority of norovirus outbreaks in healthcare settings. the function of the non-structural 1- <dig> protein from hunov is unknown.


RESULTS

in silico analysis of human norovirus ns1- <dig> protein showed that it shares features with the murine ns1- <dig> protein, including a disordered region, a transmembrane domain and h-box and nc sequence motifs. the proteins also contain caspase cleavage and phosphorylation sites, indicating that processing and phosphorylation may be a conserved feature of norovirus ns1- <dig> proteins. in this study, rna transcripts of human and murine norovirus full-length and the disordered region of ns1- <dig> were transfected into monocytes, and next generation sequencing was used to analyse the transcriptomic profile of cells expressing virus proteins. the profiles were then compared to the transcriptomic profile of mnv-infected cells.


CONCLUSIONS
rnaseq analysis showed that ns1- <dig> proteins from human and murine noroviruses affect multiple immune systems  and intracellular pathways  in murine monocytes. comparison to the transcriptomic profile of mnv-infected cells indicated the pathways that ns1- <dig> may affect during norovirus infection.
