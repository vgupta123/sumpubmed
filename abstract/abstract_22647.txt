BACKGROUND
this paper presents the use of support vector machines  for prediction and analysis of antisense oligonucleotide  efficacy. the collected database comprises  <dig> ao molecules including  <dig> features each, inducing a problem well-suited to svms. the task of feature selection is crucial given the presence of noisy or redundant features, and the well-known problem of the curse of dimensionality. we propose a two-stage strategy to develop an optimal model:  feature selection using correlation analysis, mutual information, and svm-based recursive feature elimination , and  ao prediction using standard and profiled svm formulations. a profiled svm gives different weights to different parts of the training data to focus the training on the most important regions.


RESULTS
in the first stage, the svm-rfe technique was most efficient and robust in the presence of low number of samples and high input space dimension. this method yielded an optimal subset of  <dig> representative features, which were all related to energy and sequence motifs. the second stage evaluated the performance of the predictors  using 8-fold and minus-one-rna cross-validation methods. the profiled svm produced the best results  and predicted high  and low efficacy  aos with a success rate of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, which is better than by previous approaches. a web server for ao prediction is available online at .


CONCLUSIONS
the svm approach is well suited to the ao prediction problem, and yields a prediction accuracy superior to previous methods. the profiled svm was found to perform better than the standard svm, suggesting that it could lead to improvements in other prediction problems as well.
