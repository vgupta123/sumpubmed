BACKGROUND
micrornas  play important roles in plant growth and development. mirnas and their targets have been widely studied in model plants, but limited knowledge is available concerning this small rna population and their targets in sacred lotus .


RESULTS
in this study, a total of  <dig> known mirnas belonging to  <dig> families and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified during seed germination using high-throughput small rna sequencing. furthermore, some mirna families which have not yet been reported in monocot or eudicot species were detected in n. nucifera, indicating that these mirnas was divergence from monocots and core eudicots during evolution. using degradome sequencing,  <dig> targets were detected for all the mirnas. go  and kegg pathway analyses showed that many target genes enriched in “regulation of transcription” and involved in “carbohydrate”, “amino acid and energy metabolism”. nine mirnas and three corresponding targets of them were further validated by quantitative rt-pcr.


CONCLUSIONS
the results present here suggested that many mirnas were involved in the regulation of seed germination of sacred lotus, providing a foundation for future studies of sacred lotus seed longevity. comparative analysis of mirnas from different plants also provided insight into the evolutionary gains and losses of mirnas in plants.
