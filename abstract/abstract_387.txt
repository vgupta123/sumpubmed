BACKGROUND
whooping cough caused by bordetella pertussis in humans, is re-emerging in many countries despite vaccination. several studies have shown that significant shifts have occurred in the b. pertussis population resulting in antigenic divergence between vaccine strains and circulating strains and suggesting pathogen adaptation. in the netherlands, the resurgence of pertussis is associated with the rise of b. pertussis strains with an altered promoter region for pertussis toxin .


RESULTS
we used multi-locus sequence typing , multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeat analysis  and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization  to characterize the ptxp <dig> strains associated with the dutch epidemic. for cgh analysis, we developed an oligonucleotide  microarray consisting of  <dig>  oligonucleotides representing 94% of the gene repertoire of the b. pertussis strain tohama i. nine different mlst profiles and  <dig> different mlva types were found in the period  <dig> to  <dig>  forty-three dutch clinical isolates were analyzed with cgh,  <dig> genes were found to be absent in at least one of the b. pertussis strains tested, these genes were clustered in  <dig> distinct regions of difference.


CONCLUSIONS
the presented mlst, mlva and cgh-analysis identified distinctive characteristics of ptxp <dig> b. pertussis strains -the most prominent of which was a genomic deletion removing about  <dig>  bp. we propose a model for the emergence of ptxp <dig> strains.
