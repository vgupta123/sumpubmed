BACKGROUND
monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells  are important in inflammatory processes and are often used for immunotherapeutic approaches. blood monocytes can be differentiated into macrophages and dcs, which is accompanied with transcriptional changes in many genes, including chemokines and cell surface markers.


RESULTS
to study the chromatin modifications associated with this differentiation, we performed a genome wide analysis of histone h <dig> trimethylation on lysine  <dig>  and  <dig>  as well as acetylation of h <dig> lysines  in promoter regions. we report that both h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> marks significantly correlate with transcriptionally active genes whereas h3k27me <dig> mark is associated with inactive gene promoters. during differentiation, the h3k4me <dig> levels decreased on monocyte-specific cd <dig>  ccr <dig> and cx3cr <dig> but increased on dc-specific tm7sf4/dc-stamp, trem <dig> and cd209/dc-sign genes. genes associated with phagocytosis and antigen presentation were marked by h3k4me <dig> modifications. we also report that h3k4me <dig> levels on clustered chemokine and surface marker genes often correlate with transcriptional activity.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide a basis for further functional correlations between gene expression and histone modifications in monocyte-derived macrophages and dcs.
