BACKGROUND
in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy  studies of hiv-infected humans have demonstrated significant metabolic abnormalities that vary by brain region, but the causes are poorly understood. metabolic changes in the frontal cortex, basal ganglia and white matter in  <dig> siv-infected macaques were investigated using mrs during the first month of infection.


RESULTS
changes in the n-acetylaspartate , choline , myo-inositol , creatine  and glutamine/glutamate  resonances were quantified both in absolute terms and relative to the creatine resonance. most abnormalities were observed at the time of peak viremia,  <dig> weeks post infection . at that time point, significant decreases in naa and naa/cr, reflecting neuronal injury, were observed only in the frontal cortex. cr was significantly elevated only in the white matter. changes in cho and cho/cr were similar across the brain regions, increasing at  <dig> wpi, and falling below baseline levels at  <dig> wpi. mi and mi/cr levels were increased across all brain regions.


CONCLUSIONS
these data best support the hypothesis that different brain regions have variable intrinsic vulnerabilities to neuronal injury caused by the aids virus.
