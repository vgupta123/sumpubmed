BACKGROUND
powdery mildew and rust fungi are widespread, serious pathogens that depend on developing haustoria in the living plant cells. haustoria are separated from the host cytoplasm by a plant cell-derived extrahaustorial membrane. they secrete effector proteins, some of which are subsequently transferred across this membrane to the plant cell to suppress defense.


RESULTS
in a cdna library from barley epidermis containing powdery mildew haustoria, two-thirds of the sequenced ests were fungal and represented ~ <dig>  genes. many of the most highly expressed genes encoded small proteins with n-terminal signal peptides. while these proteins are novel and poorly related, they do share a three-amino acid motif, which we named "y/f/wxc", in the n-terminal of the mature proteins. the first amino acid of this motif is aromatic: tyrosine, phenylalanine or tryptophan, and the last is always cysteine. in total, we identified  <dig> such proteins, for which the ests represent 19% of the fungal clones in our library, suggesting fundamental roles in haustoria function. while overall sequence similarity between the powdery mildew y/f/wxc-proteins is low, they do have a highly similar exon-intron structure, suggesting they have a common origin. interestingly, searches of public fungal genome and est databases revealed that haustoria-producing rust fungi also encode large numbers of novel, short proteins with signal peptides and the y/f/wxc-motif. no significant numbers of such proteins were identified from genome and est sequences from either fungi which do not produce haustoria or from haustoria-producing oomycetes.


CONCLUSIONS
in total, we identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> such y/f/wxc-proteins from the barley powdery mildew, the wheat stem rust and the wheat leaf rust fungi, respectively. all together, our findings suggest the y/f/wxc-proteins to be a new class of effectors from haustoria-producing pathogenic fungi.
