BACKGROUND
rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus  is a highly virulent calicivirus, first described in domestic rabbits in china in  <dig>  rhdv appears to be a mutant form of a benign virus that existed in europe long before the first outbreak. in the iberian peninsula, the first epidemic in  <dig> severely reduced the populations of autochthonous european wild rabbit. to examine the evolutionary history of rhdv in the iberian peninsula, we collected virus samples from wild rabbits and sequenced a fragment of the capsid protein gene vp <dig>  these data together with available sequences from other western european countries, were analyzed following bayesian markov chain monte carlo methods to infer their phylogenetic relationships, evolutionary rates and demographic history.


RESULTS
evolutionary relationships of rhdv revealed three main lineages with significant phylogeographic structure. all lineages seem to have emerged at a common period of time, between ~ <dig> and ~ <dig>  the iberian peninsula showed evidences of genetic isolation, probably due to geographic barriers to gene flow, and was also the region with the youngest mrca.

overall, demographic analyses showed an initial increase and stabilization of the relative genetic diversity of rhdv, and a subsequent reduction in genetic diversity after the first epidemic breakout in  <dig>  which is compatible with a decline in effective population size.


CONCLUSIONS
results were consistent with the hypothesis that the current iberian rhdv arose from a single infection between  <dig> and  <dig> , and rendered a temporal pattern of appearance and extinction of lineages. we propose that the rising positive selection pressure observed throughout the history of rhdv is likely mediated by the host immune system as a consequence of the genetic changes that rendered the virus virulent. consequently, this relationship is suggested to condition rhdv demographic history.
