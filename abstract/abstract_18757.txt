BACKGROUND
the acel_ <dig> protein from acidothermus cellulolyticus is a protein of unknown function. initial sequence analysis predicted that it was a metallopeptidase from the presence of a motif conserved amongst the asp-zincins, which are peptidases that contain a single, catalytic zinc ion ligated by the histidines and aspartic acid within the motif . the acel_ <dig> protein was chosen by the joint center for structural genomics for crystal structure determination to explore novel protein sequence space and structure-based function annotation.


RESULTS
the crystal structure confirmed that the acel_ <dig> protein consisted of a single, zincin-like metallopeptidase-like domain. the met-turn, a structural feature thought to be important for a met-zincin because it stabilizes the active site, is absent, and its stabilizing role may have been conferred to the c-terminal tyr <dig>  in our crystallographic model there are two molecules in the asymmetric unit and from size-exclusion chromatography, the protein dimerizes in solution. a water molecule is present in the putative zinc-binding site in one monomer, which is replaced by one of two observed conformations of his <dig> in the other.


CONCLUSIONS
the acel_ <dig> protein is structurally related to the zincins. it contains the minimum structural features of a member of this protein superfamily, and can be described as a “mini- zincin”. there is a striking parallel with the structure of a mini-glu-zincin, which represents the minimum structure of a glu-zincin . rather than being an ancestral state, phylogenetic analysis suggests that the mini-zincins are derived from larger proteins.
