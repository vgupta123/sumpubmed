BACKGROUND
tissue specific promoters may be utilized for a variety of applications, including programmed gene expression in cell types, tissues and organs of interest, for developing different cell culture models or for use in gene therapy. we report a novel, tissue-specific promoter that was identified and engineered from the native upstream regulatory region of the human gene ndufv <dig> containing an endogenous retroviral sequence.


RESULTS
among seven established human cell lines and five primary cultures, this modified ndufv <dig> upstream sequence  was active only in human undifferentiated germ-derived cells , where it demonstrated high promoter activity . to investigate the potential applicability of the mnus promoter for biotechnological needs, a construct carrying a recombinant cytosine deaminase  suicide gene under the control of mnus was tested in cell lines of different tissue origin. high cytotoxic effect of rcd with a cell-death rate ~60% was observed only in germ-derived cells , whereas no effect was seen in a somatic, kidney-derived control cell line . in further experiments, we tested mnus-driven expression of a hyperactive sleeping beauty transposase . the mnus-sb100x construct mediated stable transgene insertions exclusively in germ-derived cells, thereby providing further evidence of tissue-specificity of the mnus promoter.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that mnus may be used as an efficient promoter for tissue-specific gene expression in human germ-derived cells in many applications. our data also suggest that the  <dig> bp-long sequence located exactly upstream ndufv <dig> transcriptional start site plays a crucial role in the activity of this gene promoter in vitro in the majority of tested cell types , and an important role - in the rest two cell lines.
