BACKGROUND
meat technological traits  are important considerations for improving further processing of chicken meat. these quality traits were originally characterized in experimental lines selected for high  and low  growth. presently, quantitative trait loci  for these traits were analyzed in an f <dig> population issued from the hg Ã— lg cross. a total of  <dig> animals in  <dig> full-sib families were genotyped for  <dig> microsatellite markers covering  <dig> linkage groups.


RESULTS
the hg and lg birds exhibit large differences in body weight and abdominal fat content. several meat quality traits  were lower in hg chickens. in contrast, meat color-lightness  was higher in hg chickens, whereas meat drip loss  was similar in both lines. hg birds were more active on the shackle line. association analyses were performed using maximum-likelihood interval mapping in qtlmap. five genome-wide significant qtls were revealed: two for ph <dig> on gga <dig> and gga <dig>  one for dl on gga <dig>  one for bco-r and one for bco-y both on gga <dig>  in addition, four suggestive qtls were identified by qtlmap for bco-y, phu, ph <dig> and dl on gga <dig>  gga <dig>  gga <dig> and gga <dig>  respectively. the qtl effects, averaged on heterozygous families, ranged from  <dig> to 31% of the phenotypic variance. further analyses with qtlexpress confirmed the two genome-wide qtls for meat color on gga <dig>  failed to identify the genome-wide qtl for ph <dig> on gga <dig>  and revealed only suggestive qtls for ph <dig> and dl on gga <dig>  however, qtlexpress qualified the qtl for phu on gga <dig> as genome-wide.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study identified genome-wide significant qtls for all meat technological traits presently assessed in these chickens, except for meat lightness. this study highlights the effects of divergent selection for growth rate on some behavioral traits, muscle biochemistry and ultimately meat quality traits. several qtl regions were identified that are worthy of further characterization. some qtls may in fact co-localize, suggesting pleiotropic effects for some chromosomal regions.
