BACKGROUND
we considered the prediction of cancer classes  using patient gene expression profiles that contain both systematic and condition-specific biases when compared with the training reference dataset. the conventional normalization-based approaches cannot guarantee that the gene signatures in the reference and prediction datasets always have the same distribution for all different conditions as the class-specific gene signatures change with the condition. therefore, the trained classifier would work well under one condition but not under another.

methods
to address the problem of current normalization approaches, we propose a novel algorithm called crosslink . cl recognizes that there is no universal, condition-independent normalization mapping of signatures. in contrast, it exploits the fact that the signature is unique to its associated class under any condition and thus employs an unsupervised clustering algorithm to discover this unique signature.


RESULTS
we assessed the performance of cl for cross-condition predictions of pam <dig> subtypes of breast cancer by using a simulated dataset modeled after tcga brca tumor samples with a cross-validation scheme, and datasets with known and unknown pam <dig> classification. cl achieved prediction accuracy > <dig> %, highest among other methods we evaluated. we also applied the algorithm to a set of breast cancer tumors derived from arabic population to assign a pam <dig> classification to each tumor based on their gene expression profiles.


CONCLUSIONS
a novel algorithm crosslink for cross-condition prediction of cancer classes was proposed. in all test datasets, cl showed robust and consistent improvement in prediction performance over other state-of-the-art normalization and classification algorithms.
