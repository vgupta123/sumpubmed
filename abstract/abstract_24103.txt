BACKGROUND
autoinducer  <dig> , a widespread by-product of the luxs-catalyzed s-ribosylhomocysteine cleavage reaction in the activated methyl cycle, has been suggested to serve as an intra- and interspecies signaling molecule, but in many bacteria ai- <dig> control of gene expression is not completely understood. particularly, we have a lack of knowledge about ai- <dig> signaling in the important human pathogens staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis.


RESULTS
to determine the role of luxs and ai- <dig> in s. epidermidis, we analyzed genome-wide changes in gene expression in an s. epidermidis luxs mutant and after addition of ai- <dig> synthesized by over-expressed s. epidermidis pfs and luxs enzymes. genes under ai- <dig> control included mostly genes involved in sugar, nucleotide, amino acid, and nitrogen metabolism, but also virulence-associated genes coding for lipase and bacterial apoptosis proteins. in addition, we demonstrate by liquid chromatography/mass-spectrometry of culture filtrates that the pro-inflammatory phenol-soluble modulin  peptides, key virulence factors of s. epidermidis, are under luxs/ai- <dig> control.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide a detailed molecular basis for the role of luxs in s. epidermidis virulence and suggest a signaling function for ai- <dig> in this bacterium.
