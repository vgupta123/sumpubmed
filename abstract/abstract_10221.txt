BACKGROUND
a single glycine max  genotype  reacts differently to two different populations of heterodera glycines  within the first twelve hours of infection during resistant  and susceptible  reactions. this suggested that h. glycines has population-specific gene expression signatures. a microarray analysis of  <dig> probe sets representing  <dig> transcripts on the affymetrix® soybean genechip® were used to identify population-specific gene expression signatures in pre-infective second stage larva  prior to their infection of peking. other analyses focused on the infective l <dig> at 12hours post infection , and the infective sedentary stages at 3days post infection  and 8days post infection .


RESULTS
differential expression and false discovery rate  analyses comparing populations of pi-l <dig>  identified  <dig> genes that were induced in nl1-rhg as compared to tn <dig>  these genes included putative gland protein g23g <dig>  putative esophageal gland protein hgg- <dig> and arginine kinase. the comparative analysis of pi-l <dig> identified  <dig> genes that were suppressed in nl1-rhg as compared to tn <dig>  these genes included a different hgg- <dig> gene, an expb <dig> protein and a cuticular collagen. by  <dig> h, there were  <dig> induced genes and  <dig> suppressed genes in nl1-rhg. by 3d, there were  <dig> induced and  <dig> suppressed genes in nl1-rhg. substantial changes in gene expression became evident subsequently. at 8d there were  <dig> induced genes in nl1-rhg. this included putative gland protein g20e <dig>  ubiquitin extension protein, putative gland protein g30c <dig> and β- <dig>  endoglucanase. however,  <dig> genes were found to be suppressed in nl1-rhg. these genes included steroid alpha reductase, serine proteinase and a collagen protein.


CONCLUSIONS
these analyses identify a genetic expression signature for these two populations both prior to and subsequently as they undergo an r or s reaction. the identification of genes like steroid alpha reductase and serine proteinase that are involved in feeding and nutritional uptake as being highly suppressed during the r response at 8d may indicate genes that the plant is targeting. the analyses also identified numerous putative parasitism genes that are differentially expressed. the  <dig> genes that are suppressed in nl1-rhg, and hence induced in tn <dig> may represent genes that are important during the parasitic stages of h. glycines development. the potential for different arrays of putative parasitism genes to be expressed in different nematode populations may indicate how h. glycines evolve mechanisms to overcome resistance.
