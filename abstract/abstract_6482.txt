BACKGROUND
a main export market for chicken meat from industrialized countries is sub-saharan africa. we hypothesized that antibiotic resistant bacteria could be exported to developing countries through chicken meat trade. the objective was to investigate the occurrence and molecular types of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcus aureus in chicken meat in gabon and to assess their dissemination among humans.


RESULTS
frozen chicken meat samples imported from industrialized countries to gabon  were screened for esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus. genotypes and resistance genes  of isolates from meat were compared with isolates derived from humans.

the contamination rate per chicken part  with esbl-producing escherichia coli  and s. aureus was 23% and 3%, respectively. the beta-lactamase ctx-m  <dig> was predominant in esbl e. coli from meat samples but was not found in isolates from cases of human colonization or infection. s. aureus belonging to spa type t <dig>  were found both in chicken meat and humans.


CONCLUSIONS
there is a risk to import esbl e. coli to gabon but molecular differences between isolates from humans and chicken meat argue against a further dissemination. no mrsa isolate was detected in imported chicken meat.
