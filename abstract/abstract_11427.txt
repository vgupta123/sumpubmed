BACKGROUND
o. stamineus is a medicinal herb with remarkable pharmacological properties. however, poor solubility of the active principles limits its medicinal value. this study sought to prepare nano liposomes of os ethanolic extract in unpurified soybean phospholipids in order to improve its solubility and permeability. os liposomes were prepared by the conventional film method, and were characterized for solubility, entrapment efficiency, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , transmission electron microscopy , particle size and zeta potential, release, absorption in everted rat intestinal sacs, and dpph scavenging effect.


RESULTS
os liposomes showed substantial enhancement of extract’s solubility from 956 ±  <dig> to 3979 ± 139 μg/ml, with entrapment efficiency of  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. ftir study indicates interaction between soybean phospholipids and os extract. tem and dynamic light scattering showed presence of round anionic nano liposomes with particle size and zeta potential of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm and − <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv, respectively. a study using the fluorescent probe pyrene showed the critical micellar concentration is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml. release studies showed 94 ±  <dig> % release in non-formulated extract and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in os liposomes. released extract from os liposomes showed improvement in dpph scavenging effect, ic50 =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml in non-formulated extract. os liposomes were stable at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , but showed reversible agglomeration at ph  <dig> . absorption in everted rat intestinal sacs showed substantial improvement in permeability of 3′-hydroxy- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  4″-tetramethoxyflavone, sinensetin, eupatorin, and  <dig> other unknown compounds.


CONCLUSIONS
enhanced solubility, absorption and antioxidant effect may improve the overall pharmacological effects and medicinal value of os ethanolic extract.
