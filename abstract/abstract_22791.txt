BACKGROUND
horses are much predisposed and susceptible to excessive and acute inflammatory responses that cause the recruitment and stimulation of polymorphnuclear granulocytes  together with peripheral blood mononuclear cells  and the release of cytokines. the aim of the study is to develop easy, quick, cheap and reproducible methods for measuring tumor necrosis factor alpha  and interleukin- <dig> receptor antagonist  in the equine whole blood cultures ex-vivo time- and concentration-dependently.


RESULTS
horse whole blood diluted to  <dig>   <dig> and 50 % was stimulated with lipopolysaccharide , pcpwl  or equine recombinant tnf-α . tnf-α and il-1ra were analyzed in culture supernatants, which were collected at different time points using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays . both cytokines could be detected optimal in stimulated 20 % whole blood cultures. tnf-α and il-1ra releases were time-dependent but the kinetic was different between them. pcpwl-induced tnf-α and il-1ra release was enhanced continuously over 24– <dig> h, respectively. similarly, lps-stimulated tnf-α was at maximum at time points between 8– <dig> h and started to decrease thereafter, whereas il-1ra peaked later between 12– <dig> h and rather continued to accumulate over 48 h. the equine recombinant tnf-α could induce also the il-1ra release.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that similar to pcpwl, lps stimulated tnf-α and il-1ra production time-dependently in whole blood cultures, suggesting the suitability of whole blood cultures to assess the release of a variety of cytokines in health and diseases of horse.
