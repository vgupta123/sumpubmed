BACKGROUND
influenza a viruses of swine  cause acute and subclinical respiratory disease. to increase our understanding of the etiology of the subclinical form and thus help prevent the persistence of iav-s in pig populations, we conducted active virologic surveillance in vietnam, the second-largest pig-producing country in asia, from february  <dig> to december  <dig> 


RESULTS
from a total of  <dig> nasal swabs collected from clinically healthy pigs at  <dig> farms and  <dig> slaughterhouses, we isolated  <dig> iav-s from swine at the weaning and early-fattening stages. the isolation rate of iav-s was significantly higher among pigs aged 3 weeks to  <dig>  months than in older and younger animals. iav-s were isolated from  <dig> large, corporate farms and  <dig> family-operated farms from among the  <dig> farms evaluated. multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that “having more than  <dig>  pigs” was the most influential risk factor for iav-s positivity. farms affected by reassortant iav-s had significantly larger pig populations than did those where apdm <dig> viruses were isolated, thus suggesting that large, corporate farms serve as sites of reassortment events.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate the asymptomatic circulation of iav-s in the vietnamese pig population. raising a large number of pigs on a farm has the strongest impact on the incidence of subclinical iav-s infection. given that only some of the corporate farms surveyed were iav-s positive, further active monitoring is necessary to identify additional risk factors important in subclinical infection of pigs with iav-s in vietnam.
