BACKGROUND
the g-protein-coupled receptor  superfamily represents the largest protein family in the human genome. these proteins have a variety of physiological functions that give them well recognized roles in clinical medicine. in xenopus tropicalis, a widely used animal model for physiology research, the repertoire of gpcrs may help link the gpcr evolutionary history in vertebrates from teleost fish to mammals.


RESULTS
we have identified  <dig> gpcrs in the x. tropicalis genome. phylogenetic analyses classified these receptors into the following seven families: glutamate, rhodopsin, adhesion, frizzled, secretin, taste  <dig> and vomeronasal  <dig>  nearly 70% of x. tropicalis gpcrs are represented by the following three types of receptors thought to receive chemosensory information from the outside world: olfactory, vomeronasal  <dig> and vomeronasal  <dig> receptors.


CONCLUSIONS
x. tropicalis shares a more similar repertoire of gpcrs with mammals than it does with fish. an examination of the three major groups of receptors related to olfactory/pheromone detection shows that in x. tropicalis, these groups have undergone lineage specific expansion. a comparison of gpcrs in x. tropicalis, teleost fish and mammals reveals the gpcr evolutionary history in vertebrates.
