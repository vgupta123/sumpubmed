BACKGROUND
limb remote ischemic postconditioning  can ameliorate cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury , while the underlying mechanism remains elusive. hypoxia-inducible factor 1α  is an important transcription factor during cerebral ischemia damage. however, whether the neuroprotective effect of lrip could be associated with hif-1α is somewhat unclear. here we tested the hypothesis that limb remote ischemic postconditioning  protecting brain from injury in middle cerebral artery occlusion  rat model was associated with hif-1α expression.


RESULTS
lrip was conducted with  <dig> cycles of 10 min occlusion/10 min reperfusion at the beginning of reperfusion. the analysis of neurobehavioral function and triphenyltetrazolium chloride  staining showed the neurological deficit, brain infarct and cerebral edema, caused by ischemia–reperfusion injury , were dramatically ameliorated in lrip administrated animals. meanwhile, the result of q-pcr and western blot revealed that the overexpression of hif-1α induced by iri could be notably suppressed by lrip treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
lrip exhibits a protective effect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion and the possible mechanism is associated with the suppression of hif-1α in stroke rats.
