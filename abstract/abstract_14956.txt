BACKGROUND
simple sequence repeats  have been successfully used for various genetic and evolutionary studies in eukaryotic systems. the eukaryotic model organism neurospora crassa is an excellent system to study evolution and biological function of ssrs.


RESULTS
we identified and characterized  <dig> ssrs of  <dig> ssr types in the genome of n. crassa. the distribution of tri-nucleotide  ssrs, the most common ssrs in n. crassa, was significantly biased in exons. we further characterized the distribution of  <dig> abundant ssr types , which account for 71% of total ssrs in the n. crassa genome, using a poisson log-linear model. we also characterized the size variation of ssrs among natural accessions using polymorphic index content  and anova analyses and found that there are genome-wide, chromosome-dependent and local-specific variations. using polymorphic ssrs, we have built linkage maps from three line-cross populations.


CONCLUSIONS
taking our computational, statistical and experimental data together, we conclude that 1) the distributions of the ssrs in the sequenced n. crassa genome differ systematically between chromosomes as well as between ssr types, 2) the size variation of tri-nt ssrs in exons might be an important mechanism in generating functional variation of proteins in n. crassa, 3) there are different levels of evolutionary forces in variation of amino acid repeats, and 4) ssrs are stable molecular markers for genetic studies in n. crassa.
