BACKGROUND
members of the aquatic monocot family lemnaceae  represent the smallest and fastest growing flowering plants. their highly reduced morphology and infrequent flowering result in a dearth of characters for distinguishing between the nearly  <dig> species that exhibit these tiny, closely-related and often morphologically similar features within the same family of plants.


RESULTS
we developed a simple and rapid dna-based molecular identification system for the lemnaceae based on sequence polymorphisms. we compared the barcoding potential of the seven plastid-markers proposed by the cbol  plant-working group to discriminate species within the land plants in  <dig> accessions representing  <dig> species from the family of lemnaceae. a lemnaceae-specific set of pcr and sequencing primers were designed for four plastid coding genes  and three noncoding spacers  based on the lemna minor chloroplast genome sequence. we assessed the ease of amplification and sequencing for these markers, examined the extent of the barcoding gap between intra- and inter-specific variation by pairwise distances, evaluated successful identifications based on direct sequence comparison of the "best close match" and the construction of a phylogenetic tree.


CONCLUSIONS
based on its reliable amplification, straightforward sequence alignment, and rates of dna variation between species and within species, we propose that the atpf-atph noncoding spacer could serve as a universal dna barcoding marker for species-level identification of duckweeds.
