BACKGROUND
the proliferation of the scientific literature in the field of biomedicine makes it difficult to keep abreast of current knowledge, even for domain experts. while general web search engines and specialized information retrieval  systems have made important strides in recent decades, the problem of accurate knowledge extraction from the biomedical literature is far from solved. classical ir systems usually return a list of documents that have to be read by the user to extract relevant information. this tedious and time-consuming work can be lessened with automatic question answering  systems, which aim to provide users with direct and precise answers to their questions. in this work we propose a novel methodology for qa based on semantic relations extracted from the biomedical literature.


RESULTS
we extracted semantic relations with the semrep natural language processing system from  <dig> , <dig> sentences, which came from  <dig> , <dig> medline citations . a total of  <dig> , <dig> semantic relation instances were extracted and organized in a relational database. the qa process is implemented as a search in this database, which is accessed through a web-based application, called sembt . we conducted an extensive evaluation of the proposed methodology in order to estimate the accuracy of extracting a particular semantic relation from a particular sentence. evaluation was performed by  <dig> domain experts. in total  <dig>  semantic relation instances belonging to  <dig>  distinct relations were evaluated  <dig>  times. the instances were evaluated as correct  <dig>  times .


CONCLUSIONS
in this work we propose an innovative methodology for biomedical qa. the system is implemented as a web-based application that is able to provide precise answers to a wide range of questions. a typical question is answered within a few seconds. the tool has some extensions that make it especially useful for interpretation of dna microarray results.
