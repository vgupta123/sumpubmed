BACKGROUND
the current taxonomy of the african giraffe  is primarily based on pelage pattern and geographic distribution, and nine subspecies are currently recognized. although genetic studies have been conducted, their resolution is low, mainly due to limited sampling. detailed knowledge about the genetic variation and phylogeography of the south african giraffe  and the angolan giraffe  is lacking. we investigate genetic variation among giraffe matrilines by increased sampling, with a focus on giraffe key areas in southern africa.


RESULTS
the  <dig>  nucleotides long mitochondrial dna dataset  comprises  <dig> parsimony informative sites among  <dig> giraffe individuals from eight populations. we additionally included two okapis as an outgroup. the analyses of the maternally inherited sequences reveal a deep divergence between northern and southern giraffe populations in africa, and a general pattern of distinct matrilineal clades corresponding to their geographic distribution. divergence time estimates among giraffe populations place the deepest splits at several hundred thousand years ago.


CONCLUSIONS
our increased sampling in southern africa suggests that the distribution ranges of the angolan and south african giraffe need to be redefined. knowledge about the phylogeography and genetic variation of these two maternal lineages is crucial for the development of appropriate management strategies.
