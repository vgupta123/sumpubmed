BACKGROUND
we study the adaptation of link grammar parser to the biomedical sublanguage with a focus on domain terms not found in a general parser lexicon. using two biomedical corpora, we implement and evaluate three approaches to addressing unknown words: automatic lexicon expansion, the use of morphological clues, and disambiguation using a part-of-speech tagger. we evaluate each approach separately for its effect on parsing performance and consider combinations of these approaches.


RESULTS
in addition to a 45% increase in parsing efficiency, we find that the best approach, incorporating information from a domain part-of-speech tagger, offers a statistically significant 10% relative decrease in error.


CONCLUSIONS
when available, a high-quality domain part-of-speech tagger is the best solution to unknown word issues in the domain adaptation of a general parser. in the absence of such a resource, surface clues can provide remarkably good coverage and performance when tuned to the domain. the adapted parser is available under an open-source license.
