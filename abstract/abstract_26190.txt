BACKGROUND
in this study, we investigated age and hemispheric differences in transcallosal inhibition  in the context of active contraction using the ipsilateral silent period . we also examined whether age-related changes in tci would be related to corresponding changes in manual performance with age. participants consisted of right-handed individuals from two age groups . the isp was measured for each hemisphere using suprathreshold tms pulses delivered over the primary motor cortex ipsilateral to the maximally contracting hand while the homologue muscles of the opposite hand were lightly contracting . manual performance was assessed bilaterally for both grip strength and fine dexterity.


RESULTS
our results yielded two main findings. first, tci measures derived from isp were strongly influenced by age, whereas differences between hemispheres were only minor. second, correlation analyses revealed that age-related variations in tci measures were related to changes in manual performance, so that left-to-right tci correlated with right hand performance and vice-versa for the opposite hand/hemisphere.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, these results concur with other recent reports indicating that mutual inhibition between motor cortices tends to decline with age. in this respect, our observations are in line with the notion that the balance of normally predominantly inhibitory interactions between motor cortices is shifted toward excitatory processes with age.
