BACKGROUND
propositional representations of biomedical knowledge are a critical component of most aspects of semantic mining in biomedicine. however, the proper set of propositions has yet to be determined. recently, the pasbio project proposed a set of propositions and argument structures for biomedical verbs. this initial set of representations presents an opportunity for evaluating the suitability of predicate-argument structures as a scheme for representing verbal semantics in the biomedical domain. here, we quantitatively evaluate several dimensions of the initial pasbio propositional structure repository.


RESULTS
we propose a number of metrics and heuristics related to arity, role labelling, argument realization, and corpus coverage for evaluating large-scale predicate-argument structure proposals. we evaluate the metrics and heuristics by applying them to pasbio  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
pasbio demonstrates the suitability of predicate-argument structures for representing aspects of the semantics of biomedical verbs. metrics related to theta-criterion violations and to the distribution of arguments are able to detect flaws in semantic representations, given a set of predicate-argument structures and a relatively small corpus annotated with them.
