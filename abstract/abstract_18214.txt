BACKGROUND
expression of higher eukaryotic genes as soluble, stable recombinant proteins is still a bottleneck step in biochemical and structural studies of novel proteins today. correct identification of stable domains/fragments within the open reading frame , combined with proper cloning strategies, can greatly enhance the success rate when higher eukaryotic proteins are expressed as these domains/fragments. furthermore, a htp cloning pipeline incorporated with bioinformatics domain/fragment selection methods will be beneficial to studies of structure and function genomics/proteomics.


RESULTS
with bioinformatics tools, we developed a domain/domain boundary prediction  method, which was trained by available experimental data. combined with an improved cloning strategy, ddbp had been applied to  <dig> proteins from c. elegans. expression and purification results showed there was a 10-fold increase in terms of obtaining purified proteins. based on the ddbp method, the improved gateway cloning strategy and a robotic platform, we constructed a high throughput  cloning pipeline, including pcr primer design, pcr, bp reaction, transformation, plating, colony picking and entry clones extraction, which have been successfully applied to  <dig> c. elegans genes,  <dig> brucella genes, and  <dig> human genes. more than 97% of the targeted genes were obtained as entry clones. this pipeline has a modular design and can adopt different operations for a variety of cloning/expression strategies.


CONCLUSIONS
the ddbp method and improved cloning strategy were satisfactory. the cloning pipeline, combined with our recombinant protein htp expression pipeline and the crystal screening robots, constitutes a complete platform for structure genomics/proteomics. this platform will increase the success rate of purification and crystallization dramatically and promote the further advancement of structure genomics/proteomics.
