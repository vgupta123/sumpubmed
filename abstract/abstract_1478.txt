BACKGROUND
functional magnetic resonance imaging  in white matter has long been considered controversial. recently, this viewpoint has been challenged by an emerging body of evidence demonstrating white matter activation in the corpus callosum. the current study aimed to determine whether white matter activation could be detected outside of the corpus callosum, in the internal capsule. data were acquired from a  <dig> t mri using a specialized asymmetric spin echo spiral sequence. a motor task was selected to elicit activation in the posterior limb of the internal capsule.


RESULTS
white matter fmri activation was examined at the individual and group levels. analyses revealed that activation was present in the posterior limb of the internal capsule in 80% of participants. these results provide further support for white matter fmri activation.


CONCLUSIONS
the ability to visualize functionally active tracts has strong implications for the basic scientific study of connectivity and the clinical assessment of white matter disease.
