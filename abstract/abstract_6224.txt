BACKGROUND
extensive studies on heterosis in plants using transcriptome analysis have identified differentially expressed genes  in f <dig> hybrids. however, it is not clear why yield in heterozygotes is superior to that of the homozygous parents or how degs are produced. global allele-specific expression analysis in hybrid rice has the potential to answer these questions.


RESULTS
we report a genome-wide allele-specific expression analysis using rna-sequencing technology of  <dig> â€“ <dig>  genes from three rice f <dig> hybrids. of the expressed genes,  <dig> % exhibited an unexpected type of monoallelic expression and  <dig> % showed preferential allelic expression that was genotype-dependent in reciprocal crosses. those genes exhibiting allele-specific expression comprised  <dig> % of the genes differentially expressed between f <dig> hybrids and their parents. allele-specific expression accounted for  <dig> % of the genes displaying more than a 10-fold expression level difference between an f <dig> and its parents, and almost all  of the genes expressed in f <dig>  but non-expressed in one parent. significant allelic complementary effects were detected in the f <dig> hybrids of rice.


CONCLUSIONS
analysis of the allelic expression profiles of genes at the critical stage for highest biomass production from the leaves of three different rice f <dig> hybrids identified genotype-dependent allele-specific expression genes. a cis-regulatory mechanism was identified that contributes to allele-specific expression, leading to differential gene expression and allelic complementary effects in f <dig> hybrids.
