BACKGROUND
ethylene receptor single mutants of arabidopsis do not display a visibly prominent phenotype, but mutants defective in multiple ethylene receptors exhibit a constitutive ethylene response phenotype. it is inferred that ethylene responses in arabidopsis are negatively regulated by five functionally redundant ethylene receptors. however, genetic redundancy limits further study of individual receptors and possible receptor interactions. here, we examined the ethylene response phenotype in two quadruple receptor knockout mutants,  ers <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> and  etr <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig>  to unravel the functions of etr <dig> and ers <dig>  their functions were also reciprocally inferred from phenotypes of mutants lacking etr <dig> or ers <dig>  receptor protein levels are correlated with receptor gene expression. expression levels of the remaining wild-type receptor genes were examined to estimate the receptor amount in each receptor mutant, and to evaluate if effects of ers <dig> mutations on the ethylene response phenotype were due to receptor functional compensation. as ers <dig> and ers <dig> are in the wassilewskija  ecotype and etr <dig>  etr <dig>  and ein <dig> are in the columbia  ecotype, possible effects of ecotype mixture on ethylene responses were also investigated.


RESULTS
ethylene responses were scored based on seedling hypocotyl measurement, seedling and rosette growth, and relative chitinase b  expression. addition of ers <dig> loss-of-function mutations to any etr1-containing receptor mutants alleviated ethylene growth inhibition. growth recovery by ers <dig> mutation was reversed when the ers <dig> mutation was complemented by ers1p:ers <dig>  the addition of the ers2- <dig> mutation to receptor mutants did not reverse the growth inhibition. overexpressing ers <dig> receptor protein in etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> substantially elevated growth inhibition and chib expression. receptor gene expression analyses did not favor receptor functional compensation upon the loss of ers <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that ers <dig> has dual functions in the regulation of ethylene responses. in addition to repressing ethylene responses, ers <dig> also promotes ethylene responses in an etr1-dependent manner. several lines of evidence support the argument that ecotype mixture does not reverse ethylene responses. loss of ers <dig> did not lead to an increase in total receptor gene expression, and functional compensation was not observed. the inhibitory effects of ers <dig> on the ethylene signaling pathway imply negative receptor collaboration.
