BACKGROUND
the liver has a large regenerative capacity. hepatocytes can replicate and regenerate a diseased liver. however, as is the case in severe liver diseases, this replication may become insufficient or exhausted and hepatic progenitor cells  can be activated in an attempt to restore liver function. due to their bi-potent differentiation capacity, these hpcs have great potential for regenerative approaches yet over-activation does pose potential health risks. therefore the mechanisms leading to activation must be elucidated prior to safe implementation in the veterinary clinic. wnt/β-catenin and notch signalling have been implicated in the activation of hpcs in mouse models and in humans. here we assessed the involvement in canine hpc activation. gene-expression profiles were derived from laser microdissected hpc niches from lobular dissecting hepatitis  and normal liver tissue, with a focus on wnt/β-catenin and notch signalling. immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent studies were combined to assess the role of the pathways in hpcs during ldh.


RESULTS
gene-expression confirmed higher expression of wnt/β-catenin and notch pathway components and target genes in activated hpc niches in diseased liver compared to quiescent hpc niches from normal liver. immunofluorescence confirmed the activation of these pathways in the hpcs during disease. immunohistochemistry showed proliferating hpcs during ldh, and double immunofluorescence showed downregulation of wnt/β-catenin and notch in differentiating hpcs. vimentin, a mesenchymal marker, was expressed on a subset of undifferentiated hpcs.


CONCLUSIONS
together these studies clearly revealed that both wnt/β-catenin and notch signalling pathways are enhanced in undifferentiated, proliferating and potentially migrating hpcs during severe progressive canine liver disease .
