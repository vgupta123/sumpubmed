BACKGROUND
our knowledge of global protein-protein interaction  networks in complex organisms such as humans is hindered by technical limitations of current methods.


RESULTS
on the basis of short co-occurring polypeptide regions, we developed a tool called mp-pipe capable of predicting a global human ppi network within 3 months. with a recall of 23% at a precision of  <dig> %, we predicted  <dig>  putative ppis. we demonstrate the usefulness of these predictions through a range of experiments.


CONCLUSIONS
the speed and accuracy associated with mp-pipe can make this a potential tool to study individual human ppi networks  for personalized medicine.
