BACKGROUND
the antifungal therapy caspofungin is a semi-synthetic derivative of pneumocandin b <dig>  a lipohexapeptide produced by the fungus glarea lozoyensis, and was the first member of the echinocandin class approved for human therapy. the nonribosomal peptide synthetase -polyketide synthases  gene cluster responsible for pneumocandin biosynthesis from g. lozoyensis has not been elucidated to date. in this study, we report the elucidation of the pneumocandin biosynthetic gene cluster by whole genome sequencing of the g. lozoyensis wild-type strain atcc  <dig> 


RESULTS
the pneumocandin biosynthetic gene cluster contains a nrps  and a pks  arranged in tandem, two cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases, seven other modifying enzymes, and genes for l-homotyrosine biosynthesis, a component of the peptide core. thus, the pneumocandin biosynthetic gene cluster is significantly more autonomous and organized than that of the recently characterized echinocandin b gene cluster. disruption mutants of glnrps <dig> and glpks <dig> no longer produced the pneumocandins , and the Δglnrps <dig> and Δglpks <dig> mutants lost antifungal activity against the human pathogenic fungus candida albicans. in addition to pneumocandins, the g. lozoyensis genome encodes a rich repertoire of natural product-encoding genes including  <dig> pkss, six nrpss, five pks-nrps hybrids, two dimethylallyl tryptophan synthases, and  <dig> terpene synthases.


CONCLUSIONS
characterization of the gene cluster provides a blueprint for engineering new pneumocandin derivatives with improved pharmacological properties. whole genome estimation of the secondary metabolite-encoding genes from g. lozoyensis provides yet another example of the huge potential for drug discovery from natural products from the fungal kingdom.
