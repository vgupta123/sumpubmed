BACKGROUND
exploiting genetic diversity requires previous knowledge of the extent and structure of the variation occurring in a species. such knowledge can in turn be used to build a core-collection, i.e. a subset of accessions that aim at representing the genetic diversity of this species with a minimum of repetitiveness. we investigate the patterns of genetic diversity and population structure in a collection of  <dig> inbred lines representing the breadth of naturally occurring diversity in the legume plant model medicago truncatula using  <dig> microsatellite loci distributed throughout the genome.


RESULTS
we confirm the uniqueness of all these genotypes and reveal a large amount of genetic diversity and allelic variation within this autogamous species. spatial genetic correlation was found only for individuals originating from the same population and between neighbouring populations. using a model-based clustering algorithm, we identified four main genetic clusters in the set of individuals analyzed. this stratification matches broad geographic regions. we also identified a set of "admixed" individuals that do not fit with this population structure scheme.


CONCLUSIONS
the stratification inferred is discussed considering potential historical events like expansion, refuge history and admixture between neighbouring groups. information on the allelic richness and the inferred population structure are used to build a nested core-collection. the set of inbred lines and the core collections are publicly available and will help coordinating efforts for the study of naturally occurring variation in the growing medicago truncatula community.
