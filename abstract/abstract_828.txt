BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae, a major causative bacterial pathogen of community-acquired pneumonia, possesses a thick polysaccharide capsule. host defense against this bacterium is mediated by activation of innate immune cells that sense bacterial components. recently, c-type lectin receptors  have garnered much attention in elucidating the recognition mechanism of pathogen-derived polysaccharides.

methods
in the present study, we first compared the clinical course and neutrophil accumulation in the lungs of dectin- <dig> knock-out  and wild type  mice. mice were infected intratracheally with a serotype  <dig> strain of s. pneumoniae, and s. pneumoniae bacterial engulfment by neutrophils and inflammatory cytokine and anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide-specific igg levels were evaluated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid . we also examined the effect of dectin- <dig> deficiency on interleukin - <dig> production by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells  stimulated with the bacterial components.


RESULTS
s. pneumonia-infected dectin-2ko mice had a shorter survival time, larger bacterial burden and lower interferon gamma  production in the lungs than wt mice. although neutrophilic infiltration in the lungs was equivalent between dectin-2ko mice and wt mice, s. pneumonia engulfment by neutrophils was attenuated in dectin-2ko mice compared to wt mice. the anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide-specific igg and igg <dig> levels in balf were lower in dectin-2ko mice than in wt mice. when bm-dcs were stimulated with s. pneumoniae culture supernatant or its concanavalin a -bound fraction, il- <dig> production was abrogated in dectin-2ko mice compared to wt mice.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that dectin- <dig> is intimately involved in the host defense against infection with a serotype  <dig> strain of s. pneumoniae. dectin-2-dependent il- <dig> production may contribute to ifn-γ synthesis and subsequent production of serotype-specific anti-capsular polysaccharide igg after s. pneumoniae infection, which may promote s. pneumoniae bacterial opsonization for engulfment.
