BACKGROUND
the growth and development of skeletal muscle directly impacts the quantity and quality of pork production. chinese indigenous pig breeds and exotic species vary greatly in terms of muscle production and performance traits. we present transcriptome profiles of  <dig> skeletal muscle samples from tongcheng  and yorkshire  pigs at  <dig> developmental periods  using digital gene expression on solexa/illumina’s genome analyzer platform to investigate the differences in prenatal and postnatal skeletal muscle between the two breeds.


RESULTS
muscle morphological changes indicate the importance of primary fiber formation from  <dig> to  <dig> dpc , and secondary fiber formation from  <dig> to  <dig> dpc. we screened  <dig>  differentially expressed genes in tc and  <dig>  in yk . cluster analysis showed different gene expression patterns between tc and yk pigs. the transcripts were annotated in terms of gene ontology related to muscle development. we found that the genes cxcl <dig>  eif2b <dig>  psma <dig>  fbxo <dig>  and loc <dig> played vital roles in the muscle regulatory networks in the tc breed, whereas the genes sgcd, eng, thbd, aqp <dig>  and btg <dig> played dominant roles in the yk breed. these genes showed breed-specific and development-dependent differential expression patterns. furthermore,  <dig> genes were identified in myogenesis. a heat map showed that significantly enriched pathways  had stage-specific functional regulatory mechanisms. finally, the differentially expressed genes from our sequencing results were confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.


CONCLUSIONS
this study detected many functional genes and showed differences in the molecular mechanisms of skeletal muscle development between tc and yk pigs. tc pigs showed slower muscle growth and more complicated genetic regulation than yk pigs. many differentially expressed genes showed breed-specific expression patterns. our data provide a better understanding of skeletal muscle developmental differences and valuable information for improving pork quality.
