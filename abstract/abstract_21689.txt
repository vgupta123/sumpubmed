BACKGROUND
the emergence of colony morphology variants in structured environments is being recognized as important to both niche specialization and stress tolerance. pseudomonas fluorescens demonstrates diversity in both its natural environment, the rhizosphere, and in laboratory grown biofilms. sub-populations of these variants within a biofilm have been suggested as important contributors to antimicrobial stress tolerance given their altered susceptibility to various agents. as such it is of interest to determine how these variants might be distributed in the biofilm environment.


RESULTS
here we present an analysis of the spatial distribution of pseudomonas fluorescens colony morphology variants in mixed-culture biofilms with the wildtype phenotype. these findings reveal that two variant colony morphotypes demonstrate a significant growth advantage over the wildtype morphotype in the biofilm environment. the two variant morphotypes out-grew the wildtype across the entire biofilm and this occurred within  <dig> h and was maintained through to  <dig> h. this competitive advantage was not observed in homogeneous broth culture.


CONCLUSIONS
the significant advantage that the variants demonstrate in biofilm colonization over the wildtype denotes the importance of this phenotype in structured environments.
