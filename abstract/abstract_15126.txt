BACKGROUND
xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae causes bacterial blight of rice , a major disease that constrains production of this staple crop in many parts of the world. we report here on the complete genome sequence of strain pxo99a and its comparison to two previously sequenced strains, kacc <dig> and maff <dig>  which are highly similar to one another.


RESULTS
the pxo99a genome is a single circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> bp, considerably longer than the genomes of the other strains , and it contains  <dig> protein-coding genes, including  <dig> not found in kacc <dig> or maff <dig>  pxo99a contains a greater number of virulence-associated transcription activator-like effector genes and has at least ten major chromosomal rearrangements relative to kacc <dig> and maff <dig>  pxo99a contains numerous copies of diverse insertion sequence elements, members of which are associated with  <dig> out of  <dig> of the major rearrangements. a rapidly-evolving crispr  region contains evidence of dozens of phage infections unique to the pxo99a lineage. pxo99a also contains a unique, near-perfect tandem repeat of  <dig> kilobases close to the replication terminus.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide striking evidence of genome plasticity and rapid evolution within xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. the comparisons point to sources of genomic variation and candidates for strain-specific adaptations of this pathogen that help to explain the extraordinary diversity of xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae genotypes and races that have been isolated from around the world.
