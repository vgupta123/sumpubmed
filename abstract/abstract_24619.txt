BACKGROUND
detecting groups of functionally related proteins from their amino acid sequence alone has been a long-standing challenge in computational genome research. several clustering approaches, following different strategies, have been published to attack this problem. today, new sequencing technologies provide huge amounts of sequence data that has to be efficiently clustered with constant or increased accuracy, at increased speed.


RESULTS
we advocate that the model of weighted cluster editing, also known as transitive graph projection is well-suited to protein clustering. we present the force heuristic that is based on transitive graph projection and clusters arbitrary sets of objects, given pairwise similarity measures. in particular, we apply force to the problem of protein clustering and show that it outperforms the most popular existing clustering tools . furthermore, we show that force is able to handle huge datasets by calculating clusters for all  <dig>  <dig> prokaryotic protein sequences  obtained from the cog database. finally, force is integrated into the corynebacterial reference database coryneregnet.


CONCLUSIONS
force is an applicable alternative to existing clustering algorithms. its theoretical foundation, weighted cluster editing, can outperform other clustering paradigms on protein homology clustering. force is open source and implemented in java. the software, including the source code, the clustering results for cog and coryneregnet, and all evaluation datasets are available at .
