BACKGROUND
currently, bacterial 16s rrna gene analyses are based on sequencing of individual variable regions of the 16s rrna gene .this short read approach can introduce biases. thus, full-length bacterial 16s rrna gene sequencing is needed to reduced biases. a new alternative for full-length bacterial 16s rrna gene sequencing is offered by pacbio single molecule, real-time  technology. the aim of our study was to validate pacbio p <dig> sequencing chemistry using three approaches: 1) sequencing the full-length bacterial 16s rrna gene from a single bacterial species staphylococcus aureus to analyze error modes and to optimize the bioinformatics pipeline; 2) sequencing the full-length bacterial 16s rrna gene from a pool of  <dig> different bacterial colonies from human stool samples to compare with full-length bacterial 16s rrna capillary sequence; and 3) sequencing the full-length bacterial 16s rrna genes from  <dig> vaginal microbiome samples and compare with in silico selected bacterial 16s rrna v1v <dig> gene region and with bacterial 16s rrna v1v <dig> gene regions sequenced using the illumina miseq.


RESULTS
our optimized bioinformatics pipeline for pacbio sequence analysis was able to achieve an error rate of  <dig> % on the staphylococcus aureus full-length 16s rrna gene. capillary sequencing of the full-length bacterial 16s rrna gene from the pool of  <dig> colonies from stool identified  <dig> bacterial species of which up to 80% could be identified by pacbio full-length bacterial 16s rrna gene sequencing. analysis of the human vaginal microbiome using the bacterial 16s rrna v1v <dig> gene region on miseq generated  <dig> operational taxonomic units  from which  <dig> species could be identified. for the pacbio,  <dig>  sequences from over  <dig>  raw reads could be assigned to a barcode, and the in silico selected bacterial 16s rrna v1v <dig> gene region generated  <dig> otus grouped into  <dig> species, of which 62% were shared with the miseq dataset. the pacbio full-length bacterial 16s rrna gene datasets generated  <dig> otus, which were grouped into  <dig> species, of which 54% were shared with the miseq dataset. alpha diversity index reported a higher diversity in the miseq dataset.


CONCLUSIONS
the pacbio sequencing error rate is now in the same range of the previously widely used roche  <dig> sequencing platform and current miseq platform. species-level microbiome analysis revealed some inconsistencies between the full-length bacterial 16s rrna gene capillary sequencing and pacbio sequencing.
