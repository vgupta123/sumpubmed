BACKGROUND
camembert-type cheese ripening is driven mainly by fungal microflora including geotrichum candidum and penicillium camemberti. these species are major contributors to the texture and flavour of typical bloomy rind cheeses. biochemical studies showed that g. candidum reduces bitterness, enhances sulphur flavors through amino acid catabolism and has an impact on rind texture, firmness and thickness, while p. camemberti is responsible for the white and bloomy aspect of the rind, and produces enzymes involved in proteolysis and lipolysis activities. however, very little is known about the genetic determinants that code for these activities and their expression profile over time during the ripening process.


RESULTS
the metatranscriptome of an industrial canadian camembert-type cheese was studied at seven different sampling days over  <dig> days of ripening. a database called camembank01was generated, containing a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequence tags  assembled in  <dig> contigs. sequence analysis revealed that 57% of the contigs could be affiliated to molds, 16% originated from yeasts, and 27% could not be identified. according to the functional annotation performed, the predominant processes during camembert ripening include gene expression, energy-, carbohydrate-, organic acid-, lipid- and protein- metabolic processes, cell growth, and response to different stresses. relative expression data showed that these functions occurred mostly in the first two weeks of the ripening period.


CONCLUSIONS
these data provide further advances in our knowledge about the biological activities of the dominant ripening microflora of camembert cheese and will help select biological markers to improve cheese quality assessment.
