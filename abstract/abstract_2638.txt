BACKGROUND
the ascomycetous family chaetomiaceae  includes numerous soilborn, saprophytic, endophytic and pathogenic fungi which can adapt to various growth conditions and living niches by providing a broad armory of oxidative and antioxidant enzymes.


RESULTS
we release the  <dig>  mbp draft genome of chaetomium cochliodes ccm f- <dig> consisting of  <dig> contigs with an average size of 5756 bp and reconstructed its phylogeny. we show that this filamentous fungus is closely related but not identical to chaetomium globosum and chaetomium elatum. we screened and critically analysed this genome for open reading frames coding for essential antioxidant enzymes. it is demonstrated that the genome of c. cochliodes contains genes encoding putative enzymes from all four known heme peroxidase superfamilies including bifunctional catalase-peroxidase , cytochrome c peroxidase , manganese peroxidase, two paralogs of hybrid b peroxidases , cyclooxygenase, linoleate diol synthase, dye-decolorizing peroxidase  of type b and three paralogs of heme thiolate peroxidases. both katg and dyp-type b are shown to be introduced into ascomycetes genomes by horizontal gene transfer from various bacteria. in addition, two putative large subunit secretory and two small-subunit typical catalases are found in c. cochliodes. we support our genomic findings with quantitative transcription analysis of nine peroxidase & catalase genes.


CONCLUSIONS
we delineate molecular phylogeny of five distinct gene superfamilies coding for essential heme oxidoreductases in chaetomia and from the transcription analysis the role of this antioxidant enzymatic armory for the survival of a peculiar soil ascomycete in various harsh environments.
