BACKGROUND
insect innate immunity can be affected by juvenile hormone  and 20-hydroxyecdysone , but how innate immunity is developmentally regulated by these two hormones in insects has not yet been elucidated. in the silkworm, bombyx mori, jh and 20e levels are high during the final larval molt  but absent during the feeding stage of 5th instar , while jh level is low and 20e level is high during the prepupal stage . fat body produces humoral response molecules and hence is considered as the major organ involved in innate immunity.


RESULTS
a genome-wide microarray analysis of bombyx fat body isolated from  <dig> m,  <dig> f and pp uncovered a large number of differentially-expressed genes. most notably,  <dig> antimicrobial peptide  genes were up-regulated at  <dig> m versus pp suggesting that bombyx innate immunity is developmentally regulated by the two hormones. first, jh treatment dramatically increased amp mrna levels and activities. furthermore, 20e treatment exhibited inhibitory effects on amp mrna levels and activities, and rna interference of the 20e receptor ecr-usp had the opposite effects to 20e treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, we demonstrate that jh acts as an immune-activator while 20e inhibits innate immunity in the fat body during bombyx postembryonic development.
