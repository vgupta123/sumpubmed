BACKGROUND
efforts to sequence the genomes of different organisms continue to increase. the dna sequence is usually decoded for one individual and its application is for the whole species. the recent sequencing of the highly heterozygous vitis vinifera l. cultivar pinot noir  genome gave rise to several thousand polymorphisms and offers a good model to study the transferability of its degree of polymorphism to other individuals of the same species and within the genus.


RESULTS
this study was performed by genotyping  <dig> snps through the snplexâ„¢ genotyping system  and by comparing the snplex sequencing results across  <dig>  regions from  <dig> grape accessions. a heterozygous state transferability of  <dig> % across the unrelated cultivars of v. vinifera, of  <dig> % across the wild forms of v. vinifera, of  <dig> % among non-vinifera vitis species, and of 0% with muscadinia rotundifolia was found. in addition, mean allele frequencies were used to evaluate snp informativeness and develop useful subsets of markers.


CONCLUSIONS
using snplex application and corroboration from the sequencing analysis, the informativeness of snp markers from the heterozygous grape cultivar pinot noir was validated in v. vinifera , but had a limited application for non-vinifera vitis species where a resequencing strategy may be preferred, knowing that homology at priming sites is sufficient. this work will allow future applications such as mapping and diversity studies, accession identification and genomic-research assisted breeding within v. vinifera.
