BACKGROUND
carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule  <dig> , an immunoglobulin -related glycoprotein, serves as cellular receptor for a variety of gram-negative bacterial pathogens associated with the human mucosa. in particular, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae possess well-characterized ceacam1-binding adhesins. ceacam <dig> is typically involved in cell-cell attachment, epithelial differentiation, neovascularisation and regulation of t-cell proliferation, and is one of the few ceacam family members with homologues in different mammalian lineages. however, it is unknown whether bacterial adhesins of human pathogens can recognize ceacam <dig> orthologues from other mammals.


RESULTS
sequence comparisons of the amino-terminal ig-variable-like domain of ceacam <dig> reveal that the highest sequence divergence between human, murine, canine and bovine orthologues is found in the Î²-strands comprising the bacteria-binding cc'fg-face of the ig-fold. using gfp-tagged, soluble amino-terminal domains of ceacam <dig>  we demonstrate that bacterial pathogens selectively associate with human, but not other mammalian ceacam <dig> orthologues. whereas full-length human ceacam <dig> can mediate internalization of neisseria gonorrhoeae in transfected cells, murine ceacam <dig> fails to support bacterial internalization, demonstrating that the sequence divergence of ceacam <dig> orthologues has functional consequences with regard to bacterial recognition and cellular invasion.


CONCLUSIONS
our results establish the selective interaction of several human-restricted bacterial pathogens with human ceacam <dig> and suggest that co-evolution of microbial adhesins with their corresponding receptors on mammalian cells contributes to the limited host range of these highly adapted infectious agents.
