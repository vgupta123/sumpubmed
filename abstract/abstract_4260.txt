BACKGROUND
studies have detected mis-assemblies in genomes of the species corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. these new discover have been possible due to the evolution of the next-generation sequencing platforms, which have provided sequencing with accuracy and reduced costs. in addition, the improving of techniques for construction of high accuracy genomic maps, for example, whole-genome mapping  , have allow high-resolution assembly that can detect large rearrangements.


RESULTS
in this work, we present the resequencing of corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis strain  <dig> . cp <dig> was the first strain of this species sequenced in brazil, and its genome has been used as model for several studies in silico of caseous lymphadenitis disease. the sequencing was performed using the platform ion pgm and fragment library . a restriction map was constructed, using the technique of wgm with the enzyme kpni. after the new assembly process, using wgm as scaffolder, we detected a large inversion with size bigger than one-half of genome. a specific analysis using blast and nr database shows that the inversion occurs between two homology rna ribosomal regions.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the results showed by wgm could be used to detect mismatches in assemblies, providing genomic maps with high resolution and allow assemblies with more accuracy and completeness. the new assembly of c. pseudotuberculosis was deposited in genbank under the accession no. cp <dig>
