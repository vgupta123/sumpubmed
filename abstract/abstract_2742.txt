BACKGROUND
cassava  storage root provides a staple food source for millions of people worldwide. increasing the carotenoid content in storage root of cassava could provide improved nutritional and health benefits. because carotenoid accumulation has been associated with storage root color, this study characterized carotenoid profiles, and abundance of key transcripts associated with carotenoid biosynthesis, from  <dig> landraces of cassava storage root ranging in color from white-to-yellow-to-pink. this study provides important information to plant breeding programs aimed at improving cassava storage root nutritional quality.


RESULTS
among the  <dig> landraces, five carotenoid types were detected in storage root with white color, while carotenoid types ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> in storage root with pink and yellow color. the majority of storage root in these landraces ranged in color from pale-to-intense yellow. in this color group, total β-carotene, containing all-e-, 9-z-, and 13-z-β-carotene isomers, was the major carotenoid type detected, varying from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %. although no α-carotene was observed, variable amounts of a α-ring derived xanthophyll, lutein, was detected; with greater accumulation of α-ring xanthophylls than of β-ring xanthophyll. lycopene was detected in a landrace  with pink color storage root, but it was not detected in storage root with yellow color. based on microarray and qrt-pcr analyses, abundance of transcripts coding for enzymes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis were consistent with carotenoid composition determined by contrasting hplc-diode array profiles from storage root of landraces iac <dig>  cas <dig>  and cas <dig>  abundance of transcripts encoding for proteins regulating plastid division were also consistent with the observed differences in total β-carotene accumulation.


CONCLUSIONS
among the  <dig> cassava landraces with varying storage root color and diverse carotenoid types and profiles, landrace cas <dig>  had low lycb transcript abundance, whereas landrace cas <dig>  had decreased hyb transcript abundance. these results may explain the increased amounts of lycopene and total β-carotene observed in landraces cas <dig> and cas <dig>  respectively. overall, total carotenoid content in cassava storage root of color class representatives were associated with spatial patterns of secondary growth, color, and abundance of transcripts linked to plastid division. finally, a partial carotenoid biosynthesis pathway is proposed.
