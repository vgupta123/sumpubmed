BACKGROUND
polymerase chain reaction  ribotyping is one of the globally accepted techniques for defining epidemic clones of clostridium difficile and tracing virulence-related strains. however, the ambiguous data generated by this technique makes it difficult to compare data attained from different laboratories; therefore, a portable technique that could supersede or supplement pcr ribotyping should be developed. the current study attempted to use a new multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis  panel to detect pcr-ribotype groups. in addition, various mlva panels using different numbers of variable-number tandem-repeat  loci were evaluated for their power to discriminate c. difficile clinical isolates.


RESULTS
at first,  <dig> vntr loci from the c. difficile genome were used to screen for the most suitable mlva panel. mlva and pcr ribotyping were implemented to identify  <dig> c. difficile isolates. groupings of serial mlva panels with different allelic diversity were compared with  <dig> pcr-ribotype groups. a mlva panel using ten vntr loci with limited allelic diversity , designated mlva <dig>  generated groups highly congruent  with the pcr-ribotype groups. for comparison of discriminatory power, a mlva panel using only four highly variable vntr loci , designated mlva <dig>  was found to be the simplest mlva panel that retained high discriminatory power. the mlva <dig> and mlva <dig> were combined and used to detect genetically closely related c. difficile strains.


CONCLUSIONS
for the epidemiological investigations of c. difficile, we recommend that mlva <dig> be used in coordination with the pcr-ribotype groups to detect epidemic clones, and that the mlva <dig> could be used to detect outbreak strains. mlva <dig> and mlva <dig> could be combined in four multiplex pcr reactions to save time and obtain distinguishable data.
