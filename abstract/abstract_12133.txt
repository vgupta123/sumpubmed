BACKGROUND
elevated numbers of regulatory t cells  have been implicated in certain cancers. depletion of tregs has been shown to increase anti-tumor immunity. tregs also play a critical role in the suppression of autoimmune responses. the study of tregs has been hampered by a lack of adequate surface markers. leucine rich repeat containing  <dig> , also known as glycoprotein a repetitions predominant , has been postulated as a novel surface marker of activated tregs. however, there is limited information regarding the processing of lrrc <dig> or the regulatory phenotype and functional activity of tregs expressing lrrc <dig> 


RESULTS
using naturally-occurring freshly isolated tregs, we demonstrate that low levels of lrrc <dig> are present intracellularly prior to activation and that freshly isolated lrrc32+ tregs are distinct from lrrc32- tregs with respect to the expression of surface cd62l. using lrrc <dig> transfectants of hek cells, we demonstrate that the n-terminus of lrrc <dig> is cleaved prior to expression of the protein at the cell surface. furthermore, we demonstrate using a construct containing a deleted putative signal peptide region that the presence of a signal peptide region is critical to cell surface expression of lrrc <dig>  finally, mixed lymphocyte assays demonstrate that lrrc32+ tregs are more potent suppressors than lrrc32- tregs.


CONCLUSIONS
a cleaved signal peptide site in lrrc <dig> is necessary for surface localization of native lrrc <dig> following activation of naturally-occurring freshly-isolated regulatory t cells. lrrc <dig> expression appears to alter the surface expression of activation markers of t cells such as cd62l. lrrc <dig> surface expression may be useful as a marker that selects for more potent treg populations. in summary, understanding the processing and expression of lrrc <dig> may provide insight into the mechanism of action of tregs and the refinement of immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at targeting these cells.
