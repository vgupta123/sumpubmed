BACKGROUND
invasive aspergillosis, which is mainly caused by the fungus aspergillus fumigatus, is an increasing problem in immunocompromised patients. infection occurs by inhalation of airborne conidia, which are first encountered by airway epithelial cells. internalization of these conidia into the epithelial cells could serve as a portal of entry for this pathogenic fungus.


RESULTS
we used an in vitro model of primary cultures of human nasal epithelial cells  at an air-liquid interface. a. fumigatus conidia were compared to penicillium chrysogenum conidia, a mould that is rarely responsible for invasive disease. confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and anti-lamp <dig> antibody labeling studies showed that conidia of both species were phagocytosed and trafficked into a late endosomal-lysosomal compartment as early as  <dig> h post-infection. in double immunolabeling experiments, the mean percentage of a. fumigatus conidia undergoing phagocytosis  <dig> h post-infection was  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. using combined staining with a fluorescence brightener and propidium iodide, the mean rate of phagocytosis was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and the killing rate  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for a. fumigatus after  <dig> h. the phagocytosis rate did not differ between the two fungal species for a given primary culture. no germination of the conidia was observed until  <dig> h of observation.


CONCLUSIONS
hnec can phagocytose fungal conidia but killing of phagocytosed conidia is low, although the spores do not germinate. this phagocytosis does not seem to be specific to a. fumigatus. other immune cells or mechanisms are required to kill a. fumigatus conidia and to avoid further invasion.
