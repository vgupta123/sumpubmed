BACKGROUND
shiga toxins  <dig> and  <dig>  are bacteriophage-encoded proteins that have been associated with hemorrhagic colitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome and other severe disease conditions. stx <dig> and stx <dig> are genetically and immunologically distinct but share the same compound toxin structure, method of entry and enzymatic function.


RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis was performed using stx <dig> and stx <dig> amino acid and nucleotide sequences from  <dig> strains of escherichia coli, along with known stx sequences available from genbank. the analysis confirmed the stx <dig> and stx <dig> divergence, and showed that there is generally more sequence variation among stx <dig> genes than stx <dig>  the phylograms showed generally flat topologies among our strains' stx <dig> and stx <dig> genes. in the stx <dig> gene,  <dig> % of the amino acid sites display very low nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratios.


CONCLUSIONS
the stx <dig> and stx <dig> genes used in this phylogenetic study show sequence conservation with no significant divergence with respect to place or time. these data could indicate that shiga toxins are experiencing purifying selection.
