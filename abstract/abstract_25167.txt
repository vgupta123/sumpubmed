BACKGROUND
the in vitro culture of endothelial cells  is an indispensable tool for studying the role of the endothelium in physical and pathological conditions. primary ecs, however, have a restricted proliferative lifespan which hampers their use in long-term studies. the need for standardized experimental conditions to obtain relevant and reproducible results has increased the demand for well-characterized, continuous ec lines that retain the phenotypic and functional characteristics of their non-transformed counterparts.


RESULTS
primary feline ecs from aorta and vena cava were successfully immortalized through the successive introduction of simian virus  <dig> large t  antigen and the catalytic subunit of human telomerase . in contrast to the parental ecs, the transformed cells were able to proliferate continuously in culture. established cell lines exhibited several inherent endothelial properties, including typical cobblestone morphology, binding of endothelial cell-specific lectins and internalization of acetylated low-density lipoprotein. in addition, the immortalization did not affect the functional phenotype as demonstrated by their capacity to rapidly form cord-like structures on matrigel and to express cell adhesion molecules following cytokine stimulation.


CONCLUSIONS
the ability to immortalize feline ecs, and the fact that these cells maintain the ec phenotype will enable a greater understanding of fundamental mechanisms of ec biology and endothelial-related diseases. furthermore, the use of cell lines is an effective implementation of the 3-r principles formulated by russel and burch.
