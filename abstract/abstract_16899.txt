BACKGROUND
cd <dig>  also called bp <dig>  is a novel member of the tnf receptor superfamily. based on its important role in multiple physiological and pathological processes, the cd <dig> signaling pathway has become a vital target for treating transplantation, autoimmune diseases and cancers. this study generated a protein fragment that disrupts this signaling pathway.


RESULTS
a dna fragment encoding the extracellular domain of cd <dig>  has been codon-optimized and cloned into ppic9k to create a pichia pastoris expression and secretion strain. sds-page and western blotting assays using the culture media from methanol-induced expression strains showed that recombinant cd40-n, a 27 kda glycosylated protein, was secreted into the culture broth. the recombinant protein was purified to more than 90 % using sephadex g- <dig> size-exclusion chromatography and q sepharose fast flow ion exchange. finally, 120 mg of the protein was obtained at a relatively high purity from  <dig> l supernatant. binding assay  shown the direct interaction of cd40-n and cd <dig> agonist antibody . the bioactivity of recombinant cd40-n was confirmed by its ability to disrupt non-canonical nf-κb signaling activated by cd <dig> agonist antibody or cd <dig> ligand and to inhibit ant-cd <dig> agonist antibody-induced tnf-alpha expression in bjab cells in vitro. in addition, our data indicate that the protein has curative potential in treating dextran sulfate sodium -induced colitis in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
the results show that the experimental procedure we have developed using p. pastoris can be used to produce large amounts of active cd40-n for research and industrial purposes. the protein fragment we have acquired has potential to be used in research or even treating inflammation diseases such as colitis.
