BACKGROUND
the aquificales are a diverse group of thermophilic bacteria that thrive in terrestrial and marine hydrothermal environments. they can be divided into the families aquificaceae, desulfurobacteriaceae and hydrogenothermaceae. although eleven fully sequenced and assembled genomes are available, only little is known about this taxonomic order in terms of rna metabolism.


RESULTS
in this work, we compare the available genomes, extend their protein annotation, identify regulatory sequences, annotate non-coding rnas  of known function, predict novel ncrna candidates, show idiosyncrasies of the genetic decoding machinery, present two different types of transfer-messenger rnas and variations of the crispr systems. furthermore, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the aquificales based on entire genome sequences, and extended this by a classification among all bacteria using 16s rrna sequences and a set of orthologous proteins.

combining several in silico features  with an in vivo drna-seq transcriptome analysis of aquifex aeolicus, we predict roughly  <dig> novel ncrna candidates in this bacterium.


CONCLUSIONS
we have here re-analyzed the aquificales, a group of bacteria thriving in extreme environments, sharing the feature of a small, compact genome with a reduced number of protein and ncrna genes. we present several classical ncrnas and riboswitch candidates. by combining in silico analysis with drna-seq data of a. aeolicus we predict nearly  <dig> novel ncrna candidates.
