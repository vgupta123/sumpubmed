BACKGROUND
the bumblebee bombus terrestris is an ecologically and economically important pollinator and has become an important biological model system. to study fundamental evolutionary questions at the genomic level, a high resolution genetic linkage map is an essential tool for analyses ranging from quantitative trait loci  mapping to genome assembly and comparative genomics. we here present a saturated linkage map and match it with the apis mellifera genome using homologous markers. this genome-wide comparison allows insights into structural conservations and rearrangements and thus the evolution on a chromosomal level.


RESULTS
the high density linkage map covers ~ 93% of the b. terrestris genome on  <dig> linkage groups  and has a length of 2' <dig> cm with an average marker distance of  <dig>  cm. based on a genome size of ~  <dig> mb, the recombination rate estimate is  <dig>  cm/mb. sequence homologies of  <dig> homologous markers allowed to match  <dig> b. terrestris with a. mellifera lgs, five of them as composites. comparing marker orders between both genomes we detect over 14% of the genome to be organized in synteny and 21% in rearranged blocks on the same homologous lg.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that, despite the very high recombination rates of both a. mellifera and b. terrestris and a long divergence time of about  <dig> million years, the genomes' genetic architecture is highly conserved. this reflects a slow genome evolution in these bees. we show that data on genome organization and conserved molecular markers can be used as a powerful tool for comparative genomics and evolutionary studies, opening up new avenues of research in the apidae.
