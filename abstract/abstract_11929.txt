BACKGROUND
high resolution radiation hybrid  maps can facilitate genome sequence assembly by correctly ordering genes and genetic markers along chromosomes. the objective of the present study was to generate high resolution rh maps of bovine chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> , and compare them with the current  <dig> x bovine genome sequence assembly . we have chosen bta <dig> and  <dig> as candidate chromosomes for mapping, since many quantitative trait loci  for the traits of carcass merit and residual feed intake have been identified on these chromosomes.


RESULTS
we have constructed high resolution maps of bta <dig> and bta <dig> consisting of  <dig> and  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphism  markers respectively using a  <dig>  rad whole genome rh panel. with these markers, the rh map of bta <dig> and bta <dig> extended to  <dig>  cr and  <dig>  cr in length respectively. when aligned with the current bovine build  <dig> , the order of markers on the rh map for bta <dig> and  <dig> showed inconsistencies with respect to the genome assembly. maps of both the chromosomes show that there is a significant internal rearrangement of the markers involving displacement, inversion and flips within the scaffolds with some scaffolds being misplaced in the genome assembly. we also constructed cattle-human comparative maps of these chromosomes which showed an overall agreement with the comparative maps published previously. however, minor discrepancies in the orientation of few homologous synteny blocks were observed.


CONCLUSIONS
the high resolution maps of bta <dig>  and bta <dig>  presented in this study suggest that by the incorporation of rh mapping information, the current bovine genome sequence assembly can be significantly improved. furthermore, these maps can serve as a potential resource for fine mapping qtl and identification of causative mutations underlying qtl for economically important traits.
