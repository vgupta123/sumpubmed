BACKGROUND
the reduction in the cost of sequencing a human genome has led to the use of genotype sampling strategies in order to impute and infer the presence of sequence variants that can then be tested for associations with traits of interest. low-coverage whole genome sequencing  is a sampling strategy that overcomes some of the deficiencies seen in fixed content snp array studies. linkage-disequilibrium  aware variant callers, such as the program thunder, may provide a calling rate and accuracy that makes a low-coverage sequencing strategy viable.


RESULTS
we examined the performance of an ld-aware variant calling strategy in a population of  <dig> low-coverage whole genome sequences from a community sample of native americans. we assessed variant calling through a comparison of the sequencing results to genotypes measured in  <dig> of the same subjects using a fixed content first generation exome array. the comparison was made using the variant calling routines gatk unified genotyper program and the ld-aware variant caller thunder. thunder was found to improve concordance in a coverage dependent fashion, while correctly calling nearly all of the common variants as well as a high percentage of the rare variants present in the sample.


CONCLUSIONS
low-coverage wgs is a strategy that appears to collect genetic information intermediate in scope between fixed content genotyping arrays and deep-coverage wgs. our data suggests that low-coverage wgs is a viable strategy with a greater chance of discovering novel variants and associations than fixed content arrays for large sample association analyses.
