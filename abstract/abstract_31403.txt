BACKGROUND
the present review summarizes current knowledge about microparticles  and provides a systematic overview of last  <dig> years of research on circulating mps, with particular focus on their clinical relevance.


RESULTS
mps are a heterogeneous population of cell-derived vesicles, with sizes ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> nm. mps are capable of transferring peptides, proteins, lipid components, microrna, mrna, and dna from one cell to another without direct cell-to-cell contact. growing evidence suggests that mps present in peripheral blood and body fluids contribute to the development and progression of cancer, and are of pathophysiological relevance for autoimmune, inflammatory, infectious, cardiovascular, hematological, and other diseases. mps have large diagnostic potential as biomarkers; however, due to current technological limitations in purification of mps and an absence of standardized methods of mp detection, challenges remain in validating the potential of mps as a non-invasive and early diagnostic platform.


CONCLUSIONS
improvements in the effective deciphering of mp molecular signatures will be critical not only for diagnostics, but also for the evaluation of treatment regimens and predicting disease outcomes.
