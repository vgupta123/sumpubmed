BACKGROUND
tumor-associated macrophages  are the most abundant immune cells within the tumor stroma and play a crucial role in tumor development. although clinical investigations indicate that high levels of macrophage  infiltration into tumors are associated with a poor prognosis, the exact role played by tams during tumor development remains unclear. the present study aimed to investigate dynamic changes in tam major histocompatibility complex  class ii expression levels and to assess the effects of these changes on tumor progression.


RESULTS
significant inhibition of tumor growth in the murine hepatocellular carcinoma hepa1- <dig> model was closely associated with partial tam depletion. strikingly, two distinct tam subsets were found to coexist within the tumor microenvironment during hepa1- <dig> tumor development. an mhc class iihi tam population appeared during the early phase of tumor development and was associated with tumor suppression; however, an mhc class iilow tam population became increasingly predominant as the tumor progressed.


CONCLUSIONS
tumor progression was positively correlated with increasing infiltration of the tumor tissues by mhc class iilow tams. thus, targeting the transition of mÎ¦ may be a novel strategy for drug development and immunotherapy.
