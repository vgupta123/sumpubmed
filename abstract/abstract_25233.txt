BACKGROUND
plant latex is the cytoplasm of highly specialized cells known as laticifers, and is thought to have a critical role in defense against herbivorous insects. proteins abundantly accumulated in latex might therefore be involved in the defense system.


RESULTS
we purified latex abundant protein a and b  from mulberry  and analyzed their properties. la-a and la-b have molecular masses of approximately  <dig> and  <dig> kda, respectively, and are abundant in the soluble fraction of latex. western blotting analysis suggested that they share sequence similarity with each other. the sequences of la-a and la-b, as determined by edman degradation, showed chitin-binding domains of plant chitinases at the n termini. these proteins showed small but significant chitinase and chitosanase activities. lectin rca <dig> indicated that, unlike common plant chitinases, la-a and la-b are glycosylated. la-a and la-b showed insecticidal activities when fed to larvae of the model insect drosophila melanogaster.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that the two la proteins have a crucial role in defense against herbivorous insects, possibly by hydrolyzing their chitin.
