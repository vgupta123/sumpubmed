BACKGROUND
economically, leuconostoc lactis is one of the most important species in the genus leuconostoc. it plays an important role in the food industry including the production of dextrans and bacteriocins. currently, traditional molecular typing approaches for characterisation of this species at the isolate level are either unavailable or are not sufficiently reliable for practical use. multilocus sequence typing  is a robust and reliable method for characterising bacterial and fungal species at the molecular level. in this study, a novel mlst protocol was developed for  <dig> l. lactis isolates from mongolia and china.


RESULTS
sequences from eight targeted genes  were obtained. sequence analysis indicated  <dig> different sequence types , with  <dig> of them being represented by a single isolate. phylogenetic analysis based on the sequences of eight mlst loci indicated that the isolates belonged to two major groups, a  and b . linkage disequilibrium analyses indicated that recombination occurred at a low frequency in l. lactis, indicating a clonal population structure. split-decomposition analysis indicated that intraspecies recombination played a role in generating genotypic diversity amongst isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicated that mlst is a valuable tool for typing l. lactis isolates that can be used for further monitoring of evolutionary changes and population genetics.
