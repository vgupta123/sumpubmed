BACKGROUND
the motif actayrnnncccr , called m <dig>  was discovered as a putative cis-regulatory element, present  <dig> times in human promoter regions. of these,  <dig>  are conserved within promoter sequences of four related organisms: human, mouse, rat, and dog. recent genome-wide studies have described m <dig> as a transcription factor  binding site for thap <dig> that does often overlap with sbs  a second core-promoter associated tf binding module, which associates with the tfs staf/znf <dig> and rbp-j. human m4-promoter genes show enhanced expression in cells of hematopoietic origin, especially in b lymphoblasts and peripheral blood b and t cells. apart from rbp-j that is well known to recruit icn <dig> , the functional role of the hyperconserved m <dig> cis-element in the context of transcriptional regulation of m4-genes in lymphoid cells remains poorly defined.


RESULTS
here, we present a quantitative proteomic investigation of the m <dig> motif tf binding landscape in lymphoid cell lines that is further validated by chip experiments and functional assays. our data strongly suggest that thap <dig> and ikaros interact directly, while nfkb <dig>  and hcf- <dig> are binding indirectly to m4-promoters in vitro and in living cells.

further analysis reveals that m <dig> is a bipartite composite cis-element, which is recognized by thap <dig> via binding to the actayr sequence module, thereby promoting ternary complex formation with hcf- <dig>  similarly, ikaros binds to the cccr module of the m <dig> motif and this interaction is crucial for recruiting nfkb <dig> to m <dig> harboring genes. transient reporter assays in hek <dig> and loss-of-function experiments in molt <dig> t cells unequivocally demonstrate that binding of ikaros and/or thap <dig> to m <dig> bearing promoters is functionally important and therefore biologically relevant. accordingly, this study validates our silac-based dna protein interaction screening methodology as a valuable surrogate for a bona fide reverse chip technology.


CONCLUSIONS
the m <dig> motif  is a functional regulatory bipartite cis-element, which engages a thap11/hcf- <dig> complex via binding to the actayr module, while the cccrrnrnrc subsequence part constitutes a binding platform for ikaros and nfkb <dig>
