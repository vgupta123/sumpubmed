BACKGROUND
recombinant peptide chips could constitute a versatile complementation to state-of-the-art in situ  synthesis, particle-based printing, or pre-manufactured peptide spotting. bottlenecks still impeding a routine implementation - from restricted peptide lengths, low diversity and low array densities to high costs - could so be overcome.

methods
to assess overall performance, we assembled recombinant chips composed of  <dig>  individual peptide spots on the area of a standard 96-well microtiter plate from comprehensive, highly diverse  short random peptide libraries.


RESULTS
screening of altogether  <dig>  clones against streptavidin uncovered  <dig> discrete new binders: a characteristic hpq-motif containing vshpqapf and a cyclic csgsygsc peptide. interactions were technically confirmed by fluorescence polarization as well as biolayer-interferometry, and their potential suitability as novel detection tags evaluated by detection of a peptide-fused exemplary test protein.


CONCLUSIONS
from our data we conclude that the presented technical pipeline can reliably identify novel hits, useful as first-generation binders or templates for subsequent ligand design plus engineering.
