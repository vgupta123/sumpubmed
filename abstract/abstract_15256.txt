BACKGROUND
although a variety of animals have been used to produce polyclonal antibodies against antigens, the production of antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies from animals remains challenging.


RESULTS
we propose a simple and rapid strategy to produce monoclonal antibodies from a variety of animals. by staining lymph node cells with an antibody against immunoglobulin and a fluorescent dye specific for the endoplasmic reticulum, plasma/plasmablast cells were identified without using a series of antibodies against lineage markers. by using a fluorescently labeled antigen as a tag for a complementary cell surface immunoglobulin, antigen-specific plasma/plasmablast cells were sorted from the rest of the cell population by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. amplification of cognate pairs of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes followed by dna transfection into 293ft cells resulted in the highly efficient production of antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies from a variety of immunized animals.


CONCLUSIONS
our technology eliminates the need for both cell propagation and screening processes, offering a significant advantage over hybridoma and display strategies.
