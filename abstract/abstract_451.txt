BACKGROUND
the gut microbiota is playing more important roles in host immune regulation than was initially expected. since many benefits of microbes are highly strain-specific and their mechanistic details remain largely elusive, further identification of new probiotic bacteria with immunoregulatory potentials is of great interest.


RESULTS
we have screened our collection of probiotic lactic acid bacteria  for their efficacy in modulating host immune response. some lab are characterized by suppression of tnf-α induction when lab culture supernatants are added to thp- <dig> cells, demonstrating the lab’s anti-inflammatory potential. these suppressive materials were not inactivated by heat or trypsin. on the other hand, treatment of thp- <dig> directly with live bacterial cells identified a group of pro-inflammatory lab, which stimulated significant production of tnf-α. among those, we chose the lactobacillus reuteri bm <dig> as an anti-inflammatory strain and the l. reuteri bm <dig> as a pro-inflammatory strain, and further studied their in vivo effects. we supplied c57bl/ <dig> mice with these bacteria in drinking water while feeding them a standard diet for 20 weeks. interestingly, these l. reuteri strains evoked different consequences depending on the gender of the mice. that is, males treated with anti-inflammatory bm <dig> experienced less weight gain and higher testosterone level; females treated with bm <dig> maintained lower serum tnf-α as well as healthy skin with active folliculogenesis and hair growth. furthermore, while males treated with pro-inflammatory bm <dig> developed higher serum levels of tnf-α and insulin, in contrast females did not experience such effects from this bacteria strain.


CONCLUSIONS
the l. reuteri bm <dig> was selected as an anti-inflammatory strain in vitro. it helped mice maintain healthy conditions as they aged. these findings propose the l. reuteri bm <dig> as a potential probiotic strain to improve various aspects of aging issues.
