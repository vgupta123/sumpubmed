BACKGROUND
the application of high throughput molecular techniques such as serex are resulting in the identification of a multitude of tumor associated antigens. as newly identified antigens are incorporated into a variety of clinical trials, standardization of immunologic monitoring methods becomes increasingly important. we questioned whether mammalian cell expression of a histadine-linked human protein could be used to produce antigen suitable for detecting tumor-specific humoral immunity and whether such an assay could be amenable to standardization for clinical use.

methods
we designed a his-tagged capture elisa based on lysate from genetically engineered cho cells for detection of antibodies to insulin-like growth factor binding protein  <dig>  a novel tumor antigen. we performed technical and preliminary clinical validation studies, including comparison to a standard indirect elisa based on commercially prepared recombinant antigen.


RESULTS
the his-tagged capture elisa could be standardized. precision experiments resulted in cvs < 15%. linearity and calibration experiments demonstrated r <dig> values of  <dig> . in comparison to western blot analysis, his-tag and indirect elisa accurately identified 88% and 93% of samples, respectively. sample concordance between capture and indirect assays was highly significant . furthermore, significantly greater levels of igfbp- <dig> antibody immunity were found in cancer patients compared to normal controls .


CONCLUSIONS
a genetically engineered cell lysate based elisa can be amenable to standardization and can detect increased levels of antibody immunity to tumor-associated antigen in cancer patients compared to non tumor-bearing healthy controls.
