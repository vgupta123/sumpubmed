BACKGROUND
virulent newcastle disease virus  was reported to cause rapid depletion of chicken bursa of fabricius. severe pathological condition of the organ is commonly associated with high levels of virus replication, intense inflammatory response and also the degree of apoptosis. in this study, the responses of chicken bursa of fabricius infected with two different strains of velogenic ndv, namely af <dig> and ibs <dig>  were investigated by observing cell population changes, oxidative stress, viral replication and cytokine expression in the organ. subsequently, apoptosis of enriched bursal igm+ cells was determined to help us elucidate possible host pathogen relationships between the chicken bursa of fabricius and ndv infection.


RESULTS
the depletion of igm+ cells and infiltration of macrophages were observed to be higher in bursa infected with af <dig> as compared to ibs <dig>  in line with the increment of the macrophage population, higher nitric oxide  and malondialdehyde  contents which indicated higher oxidative stress were also detected in bursa infected with ndv af <dig>  in addition, higher pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine gene expression such as chicken cxcli <dig>  il- <dig> and ifn-γ were observed in af <dig> infected bursa. depletion of igm+ cells was further confirmed with increased cell death and apoptosis of the cells in af <dig> infected bursa as compared to ibs <dig>  however, it was found that the viral load for ndv strain ibs <dig> was comparatively higher than af <dig> although the magnitude of the pro- inflammatory cytokines expression and cell apoptosis was lower than af <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the results of our study demonstrated that infection of ndv strains af <dig> and ibs <dig> caused apoptosis in bursa igm+ cells and its severity was associated with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokine, macrophage infiltration and oxidative stress as the infection duration was prolonged. however, of the two viruses, we observed that ndv af <dig> induced a greater magnitude of apoptosis in chicken bursa igm+ cells in comparison to ibs <dig>  this might be due to the high level of oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines/chemokine as well as lower il <dig> expression which subsequently led to a high rate of apoptosis in the chicken bursa of fabricius although the detected viral load of af <dig> was lower than ibs <dig>
