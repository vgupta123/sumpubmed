BACKGROUND
feline injection site sarcomas  are aggressive neoplasms that have been associated with vaccination. in north america the incidence estimates have varied from  <dig> case of fiss per  <dig> - <dig>  cats vaccinated. the aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of fiss in the united kingdom  in  <dig>  the ratio of fiss to vaccines sold in the uk was also estimated.

fourteen fiss were diagnosed by a convenience sample of  <dig> small animal veterinary practices in the united kingdom in  <dig> and were used as the numerator for the incidence estimates. denominator data was obtained from the computer systems of each practice. considering that a single cause relationship with vaccination is not proven, three different denominators  were used to express the potential variation in risk.


RESULTS
the incidence risk of fiss per year was estimated to be 1/ <dig>  - <dig>  cats registered by practices, 1/ <dig> - <dig>  cat consultations and 1/ <dig> - <dig>  vaccination visits.


CONCLUSIONS
when interpreting these findings, it needs to be taken into consideration that this sample of practices and their cats may not be representative of veterinary practices and cats at risk of fiss in the uk. however it can still be concluded with reasonable certainty that the incidence of fiss in the uk is very low.
