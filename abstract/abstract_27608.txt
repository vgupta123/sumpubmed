BACKGROUND
the amount of gene expression data in the public repositories, such as ncbi gene expression omnibus  has grown exponentially, and provides a gold mine for bioinformaticians, but has not been easily accessible by biologists and clinicians.


RESULTS
we developed an automated approach to annotate and analyze all geo data sets, including  <dig>  geo data sets from  <dig> microarray types across  <dig> species, and performed  <dig>  group versus group comparisons of  <dig> geo-specified types. we then built genechaser, a web server that enables biologists and clinicians without bioinformatics skills to easily identify biological and clinical conditions in which a gene or set of genes was differentially expressed. genechaser displays these conditions in graphs, gives statistical comparisons, allows sort/filter functions and provides access to the original studies.

we performed a single gene search for nanog and a multiple gene search for nanog, oct <dig>  sox <dig> and lin <dig>  confirmed their roles in embryonic stem cell development, identified several drugs that regulate their expression, and suggested their potential roles in sex determination, abnormal sperm morphology, malaria infection, and cancer.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that genechaser is a powerful tool to elucidate information on function, transcriptional regulation, drug-response and clinical implications for genes of interest.
