BACKGROUND
small rnas present in bovine ejaculate can be linked to sperm abnormalities and fertility disorders. at present, quality parameters routinely used in semen evaluation are not fully reliable to predict bull fertility. in order to provide additional quality measurements for cryopreserved semen used for breeding, a method based on deep sequencing of sperm microrna  and piwi-interacting rna  from individual bulls was developed.

to validate our method, two populations of spermatozoa isolated from high and low motile fractions separated by percoll were sequenced, and their small rnas content characterized.


RESULTS
sperm cells from frozen thawed semen samples of  <dig> bulls were successfully separated in two fractions. we identified  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> putative pirnas clusters that were differentially expressed in both fractions. gene pathways targeted by  <dig> known differentially expressed mirnas were related to apoptosis. dysregulation of mir-17-5p, mir-26a-5p, mir-486-5p, mir-122-5p, mir- <dig> and mir-20a-5p was found to target three pathways .


CONCLUSIONS
small rnas sequencing data obtained from single bulls are consistent with previous findings. specific mirnas are differentially represented in low versus high motile sperm, suggesting an alteration of cell functions and increased germ cell apoptosis in the low motile fraction.
