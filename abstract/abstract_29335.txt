BACKGROUND
bupleurum chinense dc. is a widely used traditional chinese medicinal plant. saikosaponins are the major bioactive constituents of b. chinense, but relatively little is known about saikosaponin biosynthesis. the  <dig> pyrosequencing technology provides a promising opportunity for finding novel genes that participate in plant metabolism. consequently, this technology may help to identify the candidate genes involved in the saikosaponin biosynthetic pathway.


RESULTS
one-quarter of the  <dig> pyrosequencing runs produced a total of  <dig>   <dig> high-quality reads, with an average read length of  <dig> bases . a de novo assembly generated  <dig>   <dig> unique sequences ,  <dig>   <dig>  of which were annotated against three public protein databases using a basic local alignment search tool . all unique sequences were compared with ncbi expressed sequence tags   and encoding sequences  from the bupleurum genus, and with a sanger-sequenced est dataset . the  <dig>   <dig>  unique sequences obtained in the present study represent novel bupleurum genes. the ests of genes related to saikosaponin biosynthesis were found to encode known enzymes that catalyze the formation of the saikosaponin backbone;  <dig> cytochrome p <dig>  and  <dig> glycosyltransferases  unique sequences were also found in the  <dig> dataset. full length cdnas of  <dig> p450s and  <dig> uridine diphosphate gts  were verified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or by cloning using 5' and/or 3' rapid amplification of cdna ends. two p450s and three ugts were identified as the most likely candidates involved in saikosaponin biosynthesis. this finding was based on the coordinate up-regulation of their expression with β-as in methyl jasmonate-treated adventitious roots and on their similar expression patterns with β-as in various b. chinense tissues.


CONCLUSIONS
a collection of high-quality ests for b. chinense obtained by  <dig> pyrosequencing is provided here for the first time. these data should aid further research on the functional genomics of b. chinense and other bupleurum species. the candidate genes for enzymes involved in saikosaponin biosynthesis, especially the p450s and ugts, that were revealed provide a substantial foundation for follow-up research on the metabolism and regulation of the saikosaponins.
