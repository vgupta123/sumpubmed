BACKGROUND
aluminum is considered the most limiting factor for plant productivity in acidic soils, which cover large areas of the world's potential arable lands. the inhibition of root growth is recognized as the primary effect of al toxicity. to identify genes associated with al stress and tolerance, transcriptome analyses of four different wheat lines  that differ in their response to al were performed.


RESULTS
microarray expression profiling revealed that  <dig> candidate genes are associated with al stress and  <dig> are associated with tolerance. the stress-associated genes include important enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase, alternative oxidase, and galactonolactone oxidase, abc transporter and ascorbate oxido-reducatase. the al tolerance-associated genes include the almt- <dig> malate transporter, glutathione s-transferase, germin/oxalate oxidase, fructose  <dig> -bisphosphatase, cysteine-rich proteins, cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase, cellulose synthase, zinc finger transcription factor, disease resistance response protein and f-box containing domain protein.


CONCLUSIONS
in this survey, we identified stress- and tolerance-associated genes that may be involved in the detoxification of al and reactive oxygen species. alternative pathways could help maintain the supply of important metabolites  needed for al tolerance and root growth. the al tolerance-associated genes may be key factors that regulate these pathways.
