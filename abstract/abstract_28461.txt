BACKGROUND
acetylcholinesterase is irreversibly inhibited by organophosphate and carbamate insecticides allowing its use in biosensors for detection of these insecticides. drosophila acetylcholinesterase is the most sensitive enzyme known and has been improved by in vitro mutagenesis. however, its stability has to be improved for extensive utilization.


RESULTS
to create a disulfide bond that could increase the stability of the drosophila melanogaster acetylcholinesterase, we selected seven positions taking into account first the distance between cÎ² of two residues, in which newly introduced cysteines will form the new disulfide bond and second the conservation of the residues in the cholinesterase family. most disulfide bonds tested did not increase and even decreased the stability of the protein. however, one engineered disulfide bridge, i327c/d375c showed significant stability increase toward denaturation by temperature , urea, organic solvent and provided resistance to protease degradation. the new disulfide bridge links the n-terminal domain  to the c-terminal domain. the quantities produced by this mutant were the same as in wild-type flies.


CONCLUSIONS
addition of a disulfide bridge may either stabilize or unstabilize proteins. one bond out of the  <dig> tested provided significant stabilisation.
