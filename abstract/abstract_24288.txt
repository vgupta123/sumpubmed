BACKGROUND
we have previously shown that the p. gingivalis hmuy hemophore-like protein binds heme and scavenges heme from host hemoproteins to further deliver it to the cognate heme receptor hmur. the aim of this study was to characterize structural features of hmuy variants in the presence and absence of heme with respect to roles of tryptophan residues in conformational stability.


RESULTS
hmuy possesses tryptophan residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  which are conserved in hmuy homologs present in a variety of bacteria, and a tryptophan residue at position  <dig>  which has been found only in hmuy identified in p. gingivalis strains. we expressed and purified the wildtype hmuy and its protein variants with single tryptophan residues replaced by alanine or tyrosine residues. all hmuy variants were subjected to thermal denaturation and fluorescence spectroscopy analyses. replacement of the most buried w <dig> only moderately affects protein stability. the most profound effect of the lack of a large hydrophobic side chain in respect to thermal stability is observed for w <dig>  also replacement of the w <dig> exposed on the surface results in the greatest loss of protein stability and even the large aromatic side chain of a tyrosine residue has little potential to substitute this tryptophan residue. heme binding leads to different exposure of the tryptophan residue at position  <dig> to the surface of the protein. differences in structural stability of hmuy variants suggest the change of the tertiary structure of the protein upon heme binding.


CONCLUSIONS
here we demonstrate differential roles of tryptophan residues in the protein conformational stability. we also propose different conformations of apo- and holohmuy caused by tertiary changes which allow heme binding to the protein.
