BACKGROUND
polycystin- <dig>  is a large plasma membrane receptor, encoded by the pkd <dig> gene, which is mutated in most cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease . the disease is characterized by renal cysts. the precise function of pc- <dig> remains elusive, although several studies suggest that it can regulate the cellular shape in response to external stimuli. we and others reported that pc- <dig> regulates the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration.


RESULTS
here we show that cells over-expressing pc- <dig> display enhanced adhesion rates to the substrate, while cells lacking pc- <dig> have a reduced capability to adhere. in search for the mechanism responsible for this new property of pc- <dig> we found that this receptor is able to regulate the stability of the microtubules, in addition to its capability to regulate the actin cytoskeleton. the two cytoskeletal components are acting in a coordinated fashion. notably, we uncovered that pc- <dig> regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton impacts on the turnover rates of focal adhesions in migrating cells and we link all these properties to the capability of pc- <dig> to regulate the activation state of focal adhesion kinase .


CONCLUSIONS
in this study we show several new features of the pc- <dig> receptor in modulating microtubules and adhesion dynamics, which are essential for its capability to regulate migration.
