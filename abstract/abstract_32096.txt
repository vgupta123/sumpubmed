BACKGROUND
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization  is a crucial step leading to apoptotic destruction of cancer cells. bcl- <dig> family proteins delicately regulate mitochondrial outer membrane integrity through protein-protein interactions, which makes the mitochondrion an ideal cell-free system for screening molecules targeting the bcl- <dig> anti-apoptotic proteins. but assay conditions need to be optimized for more reliable results. in this study, we aimed at establishing a reliable functional assay using mitochondria isolated from breast cancer cells to decipher the mode of action of bh <dig> peptides derived from bh3-only proteins. in this study, high ionic strength buffer was adopted during the initiation of momp. mitochondria isolated from human breast cancer cell lines with distinct expression patterns of bcl- <dig> anti-apoptotic proteins were permeabilized by different bh <dig> peptides alone or in combination, with or without the presence of recombinant anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> family proteins. cytochrome c and smac/diablo were tested in both supernatants and mitochondrial pellets by western blotting.


RESULTS
sufficient ionic strength was required for optimal release of cytochrome c. bad and noxa bh <dig> peptides exhibited their bona fide antagonistic effects against bcl-2/bcl-xl and mcl- <dig> proteins, respectively, whereas bim bh <dig> peptide antagonized all three anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> members. bad and noxa peptides synergized with each other in the induction of momp when mitochondria were dually protected by both bcl-2/bcl-xl and mcl- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this method based on momp is a useful screening tool for identifying bh <dig> mimetics with selective toxicity against breast cancer cell mitochondria protected by the three major bcl- <dig> anti-apoptotic proteins.
