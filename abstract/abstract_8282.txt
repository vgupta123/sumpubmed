BACKGROUND
plant sucrose uptake transporters  are h+/sucrose symporters related to the major facilitator superfamily . suts are essential for plant growth but little is known about their transport mechanism. recent work identified several conserved, charged amino acids within transmembrane spans  in suts that are essential for transport activity. here we further evaluated the role of one of these positions, r <dig> in the fourth tms of ossut <dig>  a type ii sut.


RESULTS
the ossut <dig> mutant, studied by expression in plants, yeast, and xenopus oocytes, did not transport sucrose but showed a h+ leak that was blocked by sucrose. the h+ leak was also blocked by β-phenyl glucoside which is not translocated by ossut <dig>  replacing the corresponding arg in type i and type iii suts, atsuc <dig> and ljsut <dig>  respectively, also resulted in loss of sucrose transport activity. fluorination at the glucosyl  <dig> and  <dig> positions of α-phenyl glucoside greatly decreased transport by wild type ossut <dig> but did not affect the ability to block h+ leak in the r188k mutant.


CONCLUSIONS
ossut <dig> r <dig> appears to be essential for sucrose translocation but not for substrate interaction that blocks h+ leak. therefore, we propose that an additional binding site functions in the initial recognition of substrates. the corresponding arg in type i and iii suts are equally important. we propose that r <dig> interacts with glucosyl 3-oh and 4-oh during translocation.
