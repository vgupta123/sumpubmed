BACKGROUND
understanding genome evolution provides insight into biological mechanisms. for many years comparative genomics and analysis of conserved chromosomal regions have helped to unravel the mechanisms involved in genome evolution and their implications for the study of biological systems. detection of conserved regions  not only helps clarify genome evolution but also makes it possible to identify quantitative trait loci  and investigate gene function.

the identification and comparison of conserved regions on a genome scale is computationally intensive, making process automation essential. three key requirements are necessary: consideration of phylogeny to identify orthologs between multiple species, frequent updating of the annotation and panel of compared genomes and computation of statistical tests to assess the significance of identified conserved gene clusters.


RESULTS
we developed a modular system superimposed on a multi-agent framework, called cassiope . cassiope automatically identifies statistically significant conserved regions between multiple genomes based on automated phylogenies and statistical testing. conserved regions were searched for in  <dig> species and  <dig>  hits were found. to our knowledge, cassiope is the first system to date that integrates evolutionary biology-based concepts and fulfills all three key requirements stated above. all results are available at 


CONCLUSIONS
cassiope makes it possible to study conserved regions from a chosen query genetic region and to infer conserved gene clusters based on phylogenies and statistical tests assessing the significance of these conserved regions.
