BACKGROUND
the nextera protocol, which utilises a transposome based approach to create libraries for illumina sequencing, requires pure dna template, an accurate assessment of input concentration and a column clean-up that limits its applicability for high-throughput sample preparation. we addressed the identified limitations to develop a robust workflow that supports both rapid and high-throughput projects also reducing reagent costs.


RESULTS
we show that an initial bead-based normalisation step can remove the need for quantification and improves sample purity. a 75% cost reduction was achieved with a low-volume modified protocol which was tested over genomes with different gc content to demonstrate its robustness. finally we developed a custom set of index tags and primers which increase the number of samples that can simultaneously be sequenced on a single lane of an illumina instrument.


CONCLUSIONS
we addressed the bottlenecks of nextera library construction to produce a modified protocol which harnesses the full power of the nextera kit and allows the reproducible construction of libraries on a high-throughput scale reducing the associated cost of the kit.
