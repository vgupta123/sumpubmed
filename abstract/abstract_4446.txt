BACKGROUND
guanine nucleotide exchange factors  and their target rho gtpases regulate cytoskeletal changes and membrane trafficking. dynamin, a large force-generating gtpase, plays an essential role in membrane tubulation and fission in cells. kalirin <dig>  a neuronal rhogef, is found in growth cones early in development and in dendritic spines later in development.


RESULTS
the igfn domain of kalirin <dig>  not present in other kalirin isoforms, binds dynamin <dig> and dynamin <dig>  an inactivating mutation in the gtpase domain of dynamin diminishes this interaction and the isolated gtpase domain of dynamin retains the ability to bind kalirin <dig>  co-immunoprecipitation demonstrates an interaction of kalirin <dig> and dynamin <dig> in embryonic brain. purified recombinant kalirin-igfn domain inhibits the ability of purified rat brain dynamin to oligomerize in response to the presence of liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol- <dig> -bisphosphate. consistent with this, expression of exogenous kalirin <dig> or its igfn domain in pc <dig> cells disrupts clathrin-mediated transferrin endocytosis. similarly, expression of exogenous kalirin <dig> disrupts transferrin endocytosis in cortical neurons. expression of kalirin <dig>  a shorter isoform which lacks the igfn domain, was previously shown to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis; the gtpase domain of dynamin does not interact with kalirin <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
kalirin <dig> may play a role in coordinating rho gtpase-mediated changes in the actin cytoskeleton with dynamin-mediated changes in membrane trafficking.
