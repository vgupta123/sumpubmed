BACKGROUND
the rapid spread of clostridium difficile nap1/bi/ <dig>  has become one of the leading threats of healthcare-associated infections worldwide. however, c. difficile  <dig> infections have been rarely reported in asia, particularly in china.


RESULTS
in this study, we identified a rare c. difficile bloodstream infection  from three isolates of a patient during repeated hospital admission. this finding triggered a retrospective epidemiological study to scan all cases and strains emerged from this ward during the past three years. using medical personnel interviews, medical record reviews and the genomic epidemiology, two outbreaks in  <dig> and 2013– <dig> were identified. through using whole genome sequencing, we succeeded to trace the origin of the bsi strain. surprisingly, we found the genome sequences were similar to c. difficile  <dig> strain r <dig>  indicating the occurrence of a rare c. difficile  <dig> strain in china. integrated epidemiological investigation and whole genome sequencing of all strains, we constructed a nosocomial transmission map of these two c. difficile  <dig> outbreaks and traced the origin of the infection.


CONCLUSIONS
by genome sequencing, spatio-temporal analysis and field epidemiology investigation, we can estimate their complex transform network and reveal the possible modes of transmission in this ward. based on their genetic diversity, we can assume that the toilets, bathroom, and janitor’s equipment room may be contaminated area, which may be suggested to improve infection control measures in the following health care.
