BACKGROUND
fecal microbiota transplantation  induces remission in ulcerative colitis . however, the treatment effect of fmt diminishes over time. maintaining the diversity of the gut flora for long periods may improve the effects of fmt in uc. pectin, which can be fermented by gut microbiota into short-chain fatty acids, is postulated to shape the composition and maintain the balance of gut microbiota following transplantation. this study investigated whether pectin could enhance the effects of fmt in uc patients.


RESULTS
three fmt patients and four fmtp patients achieved the primary outcome. the mayo scores of the fmtp group were lower than those of the fmt group at weeks  <dig> and  <dig> . there were no differences in the diversity of the gut flora between the two groups at weeks  <dig> and 12; however, the composition of the gut flora of the fmtp group was more similar than the fmt group to that of the donor at all-time points post-treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
pectin decreased the mayo score by preserving the diversity of the gut flora following fmt for uc.
