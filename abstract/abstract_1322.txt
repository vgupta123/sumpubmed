BACKGROUND
comprehensive exploration of protein-protein interactions is a challenging route to understand biological processes. for efficiently enlarging protein interactions annotated with residue-based binding models, we proposed a new concept "3d-domain interolog mapping" with a scoring system to explore all possible protein pairs between the two homolog families, derived from a known 3d-structure dimmer , across multiple species. each family consists of homologous proteins which have interacting domains of the template for studying domain interface evolution of two interacting homolog families.


RESULTS
the 3d-interologs database records the evolution of protein-protein interactions database across multiple species. based on "3d-domain interolog mapping" and a new scoring function, we infer  <dig>  protein-protein interactions by using  <dig>  three-dimensional  structure heterodimers to search the uniprot database . the 3d- interologs database comprises  <dig>  species and  <dig>  protein-protein interactions, including  <dig>  interactions  and  <dig>  interactions  summarized from the intact database. for a protein-protein interaction, the 3d-interologs database shows functional annotations , interacting domains and binding models . additionally, this database provides couple-conserved residues and the interacting evolution by exploring the interologs across multiple species. experimental results reveal that the proposed scoring function obtains good agreement for the binding affinity of  <dig> mutated residues from the asedb. the precision and recall of our method are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, by using  <dig> non-redundant heterodimers to search on the integr <dig> database .


CONCLUSIONS
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can infer reliable physical protein-protein interactions and be useful for studying the protein-protein interaction evolution across multiple species. in addition, the top-ranked strategy and template interface score are able to significantly improve the accuracies of identifying protein-protein interactions in a complete genome. the 3d-interologs database is available at http://3d- interologs.life.nctu.edu.tw.
