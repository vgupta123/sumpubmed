BACKGROUND
regulatory t cells  can employ a cell contact- and granzyme b-dependent mechanism to mediate suppression of bystander t and b cells. murine studies indicate that granzyme b is involved in the treg-mediated suppression of anti-tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment and in the treg-mediated maintenance of allograft survival. in spite of its central importance, a detailed study of granzyme b expression patterns in human tregs has not been performed.


RESULTS
our data demonstrated that natural tregs freshly isolated from the peripheral blood of normal adults lacked granzyme b expression. tregs subjected to prolonged tcr and cd <dig> triggering, in the presence of il- <dig>  expressed high levels of granzyme b but cd <dig> stimulation alone or il- <dig> treatment alone failed to induce granzyme b. treatment of tregs with the mammalian target of rapamycin  inhibitor, rapamycin or the pi <dig> kinase  inhibitor ly <dig> markedly suppressed granzyme b expression. however, neither rapamycin, as previously reported by others, nor ly <dig> inhibited treg proliferation or induced significant cell death in tcr/cd28/il- <dig> stimulated cells. the proliferation rate of tregs was markedly higher than that of cd4+ conventional t cells in the setting of rapamycin treatment. tregs expanded by cd3/cd28/il- <dig> stimulation without rapamycin demonstrated increased in vitro cytotoxic activity compared to tregs expanded in the presence of rapamycin in both short term  and long term  cytotoxicity assays.


CONCLUSIONS
tcr/cd <dig> mediated activation of the pi3k-mtor pathway is important for granyzme b expression but not proliferation in regulatory t cells. these findings may indicate that suppressive mechanisms other than granzyme b are utilized by rapamycin-expanded tregs.
