BACKGROUND
this study investigated the prevalence, serotypes and antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of salmonella enterica in environment in ouagadougou, burkina faso. a total of  <dig> samples, consisting of  <dig> samples of tap water,  <dig> samples of well water,  <dig> samples of channel water,  <dig> samples of reservoir water,  <dig> samples of fish, and  <dig> samples of lettuce were examined using standard bacteriological procedures for salmonella.


RESULTS
salmonella were isolated from  <dig> samples. salmonella were rare in drinking water, since they were not found at all from the tap water, and only in 2 % of well water. salmonella were more common in the water of reservoir of tanghin , reservoir of yamtenga , and in the water channels in the city . salmonella were commonly isolated from the fish  caught from the reservoir of tanghin and from the lettuce  irrigated with water from tanghin. the salmonella isolates were found to represent  <dig> different serotypes. the  <dig> most common serotypes were salmonella bredeney and s. colindale , s. muenster , s. korlebu , s. eastbourne and s. poona , and s. agona, s. derby, s. drac, s. senftenberg, s. waycross , accounting for  <dig>  % of all the isolates. in general, the salmonella strains were sensitive to the antimicrobials tested, but two strains were resistant to streptomycin and many more intermediate to streptomycin or sulphonamide.


CONCLUSIONS
this study highlights the common prevalence of salmonella and the high diversity of salmonella serotypes in aquatic environment in ouagadougou, burkina faso. therefore, various human activities linked to water and consumption of water-related products, such as fish and lettuce, can lead to human salmonella infections.
