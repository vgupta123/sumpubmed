BACKGROUND
the cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels  maintain cation homeostasis essential for a wide range of physiological processes in plant cells. however, the precise subcellular locations and trafficking of these membrane proteins are poorly understood. this is further complicated by a general deficiency of information about targeting pathways of membrane proteins in plants. to investigate cngc trafficking and localization, we have measured atcngc <dig> and atcngc <dig> expression in roots and leaves, analyzed atcngc10-gfp fusions transiently expressed in protoplasts, and conducted immunofluorescence labeling of protoplasts and immunoelectron microscopic analysis of high pressure frozen leaves and roots.


RESULTS
atcngc <dig> mrna and protein levels were  <dig> -fold higher in roots than leaves, while atcngc <dig> mrna and protein levels were nearly equal in these tissues. the atcngc10-egfp fusion was targeted to the plasma membrane in leaf protoplasts, and lightly labeled several intracellular structures. immunofluorescence microscopy with affinity purified cngc-specific antisera indicated that atcngc <dig> and atcngc <dig> are present in the plasma membrane of protoplasts. immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that atcngc <dig> was associated with the plasma membrane of mesophyll, palisade parenchyma and epidermal cells of leaves, and the meristem, columella and cap cells of roots. atcncg <dig> was also observed in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi cisternae and vesicles of 50â€“ <dig> nm in size. patch clamp assays of an atcngc10-gfp fusion expressed in hek <dig> cells measured significant cation currents.


CONCLUSIONS
atcngc <dig> and atcngc <dig> are plasma membrane proteins. we postulate that atcngc <dig> traffics from the endoplasmic reticulum via the golgi apparatus and associated vesicles to the plasma membrane. the presence of the cation channel, atcngc <dig>  in root cap meristem cells, cell plate, and gravity-sensing columella cells, combined with the previously reported antisense phenotypes of decreased gravitropic and cell enlargement responses, suggest roles of atcngc <dig> in modulating cation balance required for root gravitropism, cell division and growth.
