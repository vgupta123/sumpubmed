BACKGROUND
the rickettsial bacterium ehrlichia ruminantium is the causative agent of heartwater, a potential zoonotic disease of ruminants transmitted by ticks of the genus amblyomma. the disease is distributed in nearly all of sub-saharan africa and some islands of the caribbean, from where it threatens the american mainland. this report describes the development of two different loop-mediated isothermal amplification  assays for sensitive and specific detection of e. ruminantium.


RESULTS
two sets of lamp primers were designed from the pcs <dig> and sodb genes. the detection limits for each assay were  <dig> copies for pcs <dig> and  <dig> copies for sodb, which is at least  <dig> times higher than that of the conventional pcs <dig> pcr assay. dna amplification was completed within  <dig> min. the assays detected  <dig> different isolates of e. ruminantium from geographically distinct countries as well as two attenuated vaccine isolates. no cross-reaction was observed with genetically related rickettsiales, including zoonotic ehrlichia species from the usa. lamp detected more positive samples than conventional pcr but less than real-time pcr, when tested with field samples collected in sub-saharan countries.


CONCLUSIONS
due to its simplicity and specificity, lamp has the potential for use in resource-poor settings and also for active screening of e. ruminantium in both heartwater-endemic areas and regions that are at risk of contracting the disease.
