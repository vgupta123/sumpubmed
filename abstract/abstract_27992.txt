BACKGROUND
adenylation of nicotinate mononucleotide to nicotinate adenine dinucleotide is the penultimate step in nad+ synthesis. in escherichia coli, the enzyme nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase is encoded by the nadd gene. we have earlier made an initial characterization in vivo of two mutant enzymes, nadd <dig> and nadd <dig>  strains with either mutation have decreased intracellular levels of nad+, especially for one of the alleles, nadd <dig> 


RESULTS
in this study these two mutant proteins have been further characterized together with ten new mutant variants. of the, in total, twelve mutations four are in a conserved motif in the c-terminus and eight are in the active site. we have tested the activity of the enzymes in vitro and their effect on the growth phenotype in vivo. there is a very good correlation between the two data sets.


CONCLUSIONS
the mutations in the c-terminus did not reveal any function for the conserved motif. on the other hand, our data has lead us to assign amino acid residues his- <dig>  arg- <dig> and asp- <dig> to the active site. we have also shown that the nadd gene is essential for growth in e. coli.
