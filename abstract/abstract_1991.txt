BACKGROUND
foxp <dig> is a forkhead transcription factor critical for normal development of language in humans, but little is known of its broader function and regulation during central nervous system  development. we report here that lef <dig>  a member of the lef/tcf family of transcription factors activated by wnt signaling, regulates foxp <dig> during embryogenesis, and we isolate novel foxp <dig> enhancers which are lef1-dependent.


RESULTS
loss, knock down, or inhibition of lef <dig> led to loss of foxp <dig> expression. we isolated dna fragments from the foxp <dig> genomic region that function as enhancers to drive gfp expression in the cns during development, including in the telencephalon, diencephalon, eye, tectum, and hindbrain. three of these enhancers, foxp2-enhancera. <dig>  foxp2-enhancerb, and foxp2-enhancerd, contain putative lef <dig> binding sites, and are regulated by lef <dig>  however, two other genomic fragments containing lef <dig> sites failed to function in vivo as enhancers. chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that lef <dig> binds to sites in foxp2-enhancera. <dig> and foxp2-enhancerb.


CONCLUSIONS
this work shows that lef <dig> is necessary for expression of foxp <dig> in the tectum, mid-hindbrain boundary, and hindbrain during cns development, and is the first insight into the upstream regulation of foxp <dig> during development. we also demonstrate that in silico prediction of potential lef <dig> binding sites poorly predicts their ability to function in vivo as enhancers. the foxp <dig> enhancers we identified will allow dissection of foxp2's role during cns development.
