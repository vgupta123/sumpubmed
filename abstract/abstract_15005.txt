BACKGROUND
group a streptococcus  causes human diseases ranging in severity from uncomplicated pharyngitis to life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis and shows high rates of macrolide resistance in several countries. our goal is to identify antimicrobial resistance in spanish gas isolates collected between  <dig> and  <dig> and to determine the molecular epidemiology  and resistance mechanisms of those resistant to erythromycin and tetracycline.


RESULTS
two hundred ninety-five out of  <dig> isolates  were erythromycin resistant, with the predominance of emm4t <dig>  emm75t <dig>  and emm28t <dig>  accounting the  <dig> % of the  <dig> emm/t types. spread of emm4t <dig>  emm75t <dig> and emm28t <dig> resistant clones caused high rates of macrolide resistance. the distribution of the phenotypes was m , cmlsb , imlsb  with the involvement of the erythromycin resistance genes mef , msr , erm  and erm .

sixty-one isolates were tetracycline resistant, with the main representation of the emm77t <dig> among  <dig> emm/t types. to note, the combination of tet and tet tetracycline resistance genes were similar to tet alone reaching values close to 40%. resistance to both antibiotics was detected in  <dig> isolates of  <dig> emm/t types, being emm11t <dig> and the cmlsb phenotype the most frequent ones. erm and tet were present in almost all the strains, while erm, mef, msr and tet appeared in less than half of them.


CONCLUSIONS
spanish gas were highly resistant to macrolides meanwhile showed minor resistance rate to tetracycline. a remarkable correlation between antimicrobial resistance and emm/t type was noticed. clonal spread of emm4t <dig>  emm75t <dig> and emm28t <dig> was the main responsable for macrolide resistance where as that emm77t <dig> clones were it to tetraclycline resistance. a wide variety of macrolide resistance genes were responsible for three macrolide resistance phenotypes.
