BACKGROUND
regular physical activity is beneficial to the health of both people and animals. the role of regular exercise undertaken together, such as dog walking, is a public health interest of mutual benefit. exploration of barriers and incentives to regular dog walking by owners is now required so that effective interventions to promote it can be designed. this study explored a well-characterised cross-sectional dataset of  <dig> dogs and owners from cheshire, uk, for evidence of factors associated with the dog being walked once or more per day.


RESULTS
factors independently associated with daily walking included: number of dogs owned  dogs negatively associated); size  positively associated); and number of people in the household . furthermore, a number of factors related to the dog-owner relationship and the dog’s behaviour were associated with daily walking, including: having acquired the dog for a hobby ; dog lying on furniture ; dog lying on laps ; growling at household members ; and playing chase games with the dog .


CONCLUSIONS
these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the strength and nature of the human-dog relationship incentivises dog walking, and that behavioural and demographic factors may affect dog walking via this mechanism. future studies need to investigate how dog demographic and behavioural factors, plus owner behavioural factors and perceptions of the dog, influence the dog-human relationship in respect to the perceived support and motivation a dog can provide for walking.
