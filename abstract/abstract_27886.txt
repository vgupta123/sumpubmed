BACKGROUND
ligand-targeted approaches have proven successful in improving the therapeutic index of a number of drugs. we hypothesized that the specific targeting of tnf-alpha antagonists to inflamed tissues could increase drug efficacy and reduce side effects.


RESULTS
using uteroglobin , a potent anti-inflammatory protein, as a scaffold, we prepared a bispecific tetravalent molecule consisting of the extracellular ligand-binding portion of the human tnf-alpha receptor p <dig>  and the scfv l <dig>  l <dig> binds to the ed-b containing fibronectin isoform , which is expressed only during angiogenesis processes and during tissue remodeling. b-fn has also been demonstrated in the pannus in rheumatoid arthritis. l19-ug-tnfrii is a stable, soluble homodimeric protein that maintains the activities of both moieties: the immuno-reactivity of l <dig> and the capability of tnfrii to inhibit tnf-alpha. in vivo bio-distribution studies demonstrated that the molecule selectively accumulated on b-fn containing tissues, showing a very fast clearance from the blood but a very long residence time on b-fn containing tissues. despite the very fast clearance from the blood, this fusion protein was able to significantly improve the severe symptomatology of arthritis in collagen antibody-induced arthritis  mouse model.


CONCLUSIONS
the recombinant protein described here, able to selectively deliver the tnf-alpha antagonist tnfrii to inflamed tissues, could yield important contributions for the therapy of degenerative inflammatory diseases.
