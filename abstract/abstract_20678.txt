BACKGROUND
analysis of genome-wide data is often carried out using standard methods such as differential expression analysis, clustering analysis and heatmaps. beyond that, differential correlation analysis was suggested to identify changes in the correlation patterns between disease states. the detection of differential correlation is a demanding task, as the number of entries in the gene-by-gene correlation matrix is large. currently, there is no gold standard for the detection of differential correlation and statistical validation.


RESULTS
we developed two untargeted algorithms  that identify differential correlation patterns by comparing the local or global topology of correlation networks. construction of networks from correlation structures requires fixing of a correlation threshold. instead of a single cutoff, the algorithms systematically investigate a series of correlation thresholds and permit to detect different kinds of correlation changes at the same level of significance: strong changes of a few genes and moderate changes of many genes. comparing the correlation structure of  <dig> er- breast carcinomas and  <dig> er+ breast carcinomas, dcloc detected  <dig> differentially correlated genes with a fdr of  <dig> %, while dcglob detected  <dig> differentially correlated genes with a fdr of  <dig> %. in two-fold cross-validation, the reproducibility of the list of the top 5% differentially correlated genes in  <dig> er- tumors and in  <dig> er+ tumors was 49% for dcloc and 33% for dcglob.


CONCLUSIONS
we developed two correlation network topology based algorithms for the detection of differential correlations in different disease states. clusters of differentially correlated genes could be interpreted biologically and included the marker genes hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase  and acyl-coa synthetase medium chain  <dig>  of invasive apocrine carcinomas that were differentially correlated, but not differentially expressed. using random subsampling and cross-validation, dcloc and dcglob were shown to identify specific and reproducible lists of differentially correlated genes.
