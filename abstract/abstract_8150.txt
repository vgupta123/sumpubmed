BACKGROUND
in a cdna-aflp analysis comparing transcript levels between powdery mildew -susceptible tomato cultivar moneymaker  and near isogenic lines  carrying resistance gene ol- <dig> or ol- <dig>  a transcript-derived fragment  m11e69- <dig> was found to be present in nil-ol- <dig> but absent in mm and nil-ol- <dig>  this tdf shows homology to acetolactate synthase . als is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids valine, leucine and isoleucine, and it is also a target of commercial herbicides.


RESULTS
three als homologs als <dig>  als <dig>  als <dig> were identified in the tomato genome sequence. als <dig> and als <dig> show high similarity, whereas als <dig> is more divergent. transient silencing of both als <dig> and als <dig> in nil-ol- <dig> by virus-induced gene silencing  resulted in chlorotic leaf areas that showed increased susceptibility to o. neolycopersici . vigs results were confirmed by stable transformation of nil-ol- <dig> using an rnai construct targeting both als <dig> and als <dig>  in contrast, silencing of the three als genes individually by rnai constructs did not compromise the resistance of nil-ol- <dig>  application of the herbicide chlorsulfuron to nil-ol- <dig> mimicked the vigs phenotype and caused loss of its resistance to on. susceptible mm and on-resistant line nil-ol- <dig> carrying a nucleotide binding site and leucine rich repeat  resistance gene were also treated with chlorsulfuron. neither the susceptibility of mm nor the resistance of nil-ol- <dig> was affected.


CONCLUSIONS
als is neither involved in basal defense, nor in resistance conferred by nb-lrr type resistance genes. instead, it is specifically involved in ol-1-mediated resistance to tomato powdery mildew, suggesting that als-induced change in amino acid homeostasis is important for resistance conferred by ol- <dig>
