BACKGROUND
cytoplasmic male sterility  has often been associated with abnormal mitochondrial open reading frames. the mitochondrial gene orfh <dig> is a candidate gene for causing the cms trait in cms-honglian  rice. however, whether the orfh <dig> expression can actually induce cms in rice remains unclear.


RESULTS
western blot analysis revealed that the orfh <dig> protein is mainly present in mitochondria of cms-hl rice and is absent in the fertile line. to investigate the function of orfh <dig> protein in mitochondria, this gene was fused to a mitochondrial transit peptide sequence and used to transform wild type rice, where its expression induced the gametophytic male sterile phenotype. in addition, excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species  in the microspore, a reduced atp/adp ratio, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and a lower respiration rate in the transgenic plants were found to be similar to those in cms-hl rice. moreover, retarded growth of primary and lateral roots accompanied by abnormal accumulation of ros in the root tip was observed in both transgenic rice and cms-hl rice .


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that the expression of orfh <dig> in mitochondria impairs mitochondrial function, which affects the development of both male gametophytes and the roots of cms-hl rice.
