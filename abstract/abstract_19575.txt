BACKGROUND
in brazil leishmania braziliensis and l. infantum are the principal species responsible for cutaneous and visceral leishmaniases, respectively. domestic dogs are the main reservoirs of visceral leishmaniasis, while rodents and marsupials are the main reservoirs for cutaneous leishmaniasis. it has also been suggested that dogs could play a role in transmission of cutaneous leishmaniasis. the identification of the species of leishmania, the reservoirs, and the vectors involved in each particular transmission cycle is critical for the establishment of control activities. belo horizonte has emerged as an endemic region for leishmaniases, however, epidemiological studies assessing the contribution of wild reservoirs to transmission are scarce in the area. the aim of this study was to investigate leishmania spp. infection in possible reservoirs of an urbanized area.


RESULTS
a high rate of infection was found in small mammals  and dogs . the presence of l. infantum and l. braziliensis was detected in small mammals and dogs, and mixed infections by both species were detected in rodents which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first description of this phenomenon in an urban area. additionally, l. amazonensis was detected in the canine samples.


CONCLUSIONS
the possible role of these animals as a source of infection of the vector of each species of leishmania identified should not be overlooked and should be taken into account in future control activities. the results of mixed infection by l. braziliensis and l. infantum in cosmopolitan rodents as m. musculus and r. rattus, may have important implications in the context of the control of leishmaniasis in urban areas, especially when considering that these rodents live in close relationship with human dwellings, especially those in more precarious conditions.
