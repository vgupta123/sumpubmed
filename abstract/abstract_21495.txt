BACKGROUND
we previously showed that local use of periodate oxidized atp  in rat paw treated with freund's adjuvant induced a significant reduction of hyperalgesia herein we investigate the role of oatp, in the rat paws inflamed by carrageenan, which mimics acute inflammation in humans.


RESULTS
local, oral or intravenous administration of a single dose of oatp significantly reduced thermal hyperalgesia in hind paws of rats for  <dig> hours, and such effect was greater than that induced by diclofenac or indomethacin. following oatp treatment, the expression of the pro-inflammatory chemokines interferon-gamma-inducible protein- <dig> , mon ocyte chemoattractant protein- <dig>  and interleukin- <dig>  within the inflamed tissues markedly decreased on vessels and infiltrated cells. in parallel, the immunohistochemical findings showed an impairment, with respect to the untreated rats, in p2x <dig> expression, mainly on nerves and vessels close to the site of inflammation. finally, oatp treatment significantly reduced the presence of infiltrating inflammatory macrophages in the paw tissue.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together these results clearly show that oatp reduces carrageenan-induced inflammation in rats.
