BACKGROUND
gemcitabine is used as a standard drug treatment for non-small cell lung cancer , but treatment responses vary among patients. our previous studies demonstrated that pola <dig> +  <dig> gg/ga single nucleotide polymorphism  improves differential survivability and mortality in nsclc patients. here, we determined the association between pola <dig> and gemcitabine treatment in human lung cancer cells.


RESULTS
human pc <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> lung cancer cell lines were treated with  <dig> - <dig> μm gemcitabine for  <dig> h. although all  <dig> cell lines showed decreased cell viability upon gemcitabine treatment, h <dig> was found to be the most sensitive to gemcitabine treatment. next, sequencing was performed to determine if pola <dig> +  <dig> snp might be involved in gemcitabine sensitivity. data revealed that all  <dig> cell lines harbored the wild-type pola2 +  <dig> gg snp, indicating that the pola <dig> +  <dig> snp might not be responsible for gemcitabine sensitivity in the cell lines studied. silencing of pola <dig> gene in h <dig> was then carried out by sirna transfection, followed by gemcitabine treatment to determine the effect of pola <dig> knockdown on chemosensitivity to gemcitabine. results showed that h <dig> exhibited increased resistance to gemcitabine after pola <dig> knockdown, suggesting that pola <dig> does not act alone and may cooperate with other interacting partners to cause gemcitabine resistance.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our findings showed that knockdown of pola <dig> increases gemcitabine resistance in human lung cancer cells. we propose that pola <dig> may play a role in gemcitabine sensitivity and can be used as a prognostic biomarker of patient outcome in nsclc pathogenesis.
