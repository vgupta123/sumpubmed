BACKGROUND
non-coding dna sequences comprise a very large proportion of the total genomic content of mammals, most other vertebrates, many invertebrates, and most plants. unraveling the functional significance of non-coding dna depends on how well we are able to align non-coding dna sequences. however, the alignment of non-coding dna sequences is more difficult than aligning protein-coding sequences.


RESULTS
here we present an improved pair-hidden-markov-model  based method for performing global pairwise alignment of non-coding dna sequences. the method uses an explicit model of indel length frequency distribution which can be specified, and allows any time reversible model of nucleotide substitution. the method uses a deterministic global optimiser to find the alignment with the highest posterior probability. we test mcalign <dig> in simulations, and compare it to a previous monte carlo based method , to the pair hmm method of knudsen and miyamoto, and to a heuristic method  that performed very well in a previous simulation study. we show that the pair hmm methods have excellent performance for all combinations of parameter values we have considered. mcalign <dig> is up to ten times faster than mcalign. mcalign <dig> is more accurate in resolving indels given an accurate explicit model than heuristic methods, but is computationally slower.


CONCLUSIONS
mcalign <dig> produces better quality alignments by explicitly using biological knowledge about the indel length distribution and time reversible models of nucleotide substitution. as a result, it can outperform other available sequence alignment methods for the cases we have considered to align non-coding dna sequences.
