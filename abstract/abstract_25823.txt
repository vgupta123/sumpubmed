BACKGROUND

lateral organ boundaries domain  genes arise from charophyte algae and evolve essential functions in land plants in regulating organ development and secondary metabolism. although diverse plant species have been investigated to construct the phylogeny of lbd gene family, a detailed and reliable ancestry that characterizes their evolutionary patterns has not been revealed.


RESULTS
we develop an improved bioinformatic method that allows robust detection of  <dig> lbd genes in  <dig> high-quality land plant genomes. phylogenetic analysis classifies the lbd genes into six subfamilies which support the existence of  <dig> ancient gene lineages. phylogenetic relationship and gene collinearity are combined to retrace  <dig> ancestor genes for seed plants and  <dig> ancestor genes for angiosperms, which improves the resolution of lbd gene ancestry. the ancient gene lineages are strictly preserved in current plant genomes, including the previously controversial class ib gene in selaginella moellendorphii, suggesting extreme reluctance of lbd genes to be lost during evolution. meanwhile, whole-genome and dispersed gene duplications substantially expand lbd gene family in angiosperms, and elaborate functions of lbd genes through frequent expression pattern change and protein sequence variation.


CONCLUSIONS
through phylogenetic and gene collinearity analyses, we retrace the landscape of lbd gene ancestry which lays foundation for elucidating evolutionary diversification of lbd genes in land plants.
