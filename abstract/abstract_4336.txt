BACKGROUND
the lipopeptide antibiotic iturin a is an attractive biopesticide with the potential to replace chemical-based pesticides for controlling plant pathogens. however, its industrial fermentation has not been realized due to the high production costs and low product concentrations. this study aims to enhance iturin a production by performing a novel fermentation process with effective glucose feeding control using rapeseed meal as a low-cost nitrogen source.


RESULTS
we demonstrated that continuous and significant enhancement of iturin a production could be achieved by a novel two-stage glucose-feeding strategy with a stepwise decrease in feeding rate. using this strategy, the ratio of spores to total cells could be maintained at a desirable/stable level of  <dig> – <dig> , and the reducing sugar concentration could be controlled at a low level of 2–3 g/l so that optimal substrate balance could be maintained throughout the feeding phase. as a result, the maximum iturin a concentration reached  <dig>  g/l, which was two-fold higher than that of batch culture.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report which uses control of the glucose supply to improve iturin a production by fed-batch fermentation and identifies some important factors necessary to realize industrial iturin a production. this approach may also enhance the production of other useful secondary metabolites by bacillus subtilis.
