BACKGROUND
peroxisomes execute diverse and vital functions in virtually every eukaryote. new peroxisomes form by budding from pre-existing organelles or de novo by vesiculation of the er. it has been suggested that adp-ribosylation factors and copi coatomer complexes are involved in these processes.


RESULTS
here we show that all viable saccharomyces cerevisiae strains deficient in one of the small gtpases which have an important role in the regulation of vesicular transport contain functional peroxisomes, and that the number of these organelles in oleate-grown cells is significantly upregulated in the arf <dig> and arf <dig> null strains compared to the wild-type strain. in addition, we provide evidence that a portion of endogenous arf <dig>  the mammalian orthologue of yeast arf <dig>  is associated with the cytoplasmic face of rat liver peroxisomes. despite this, ablation of arf <dig> did neither influence the regulation of peroxisome abundance nor affect the localization of peroxisomal proteins in cultured fetal hepatocytes. however, co-overexpression of wild-type, gtp hydrolysis-defective or  gtp binding-defective forms of arf <dig> and arf <dig> caused mislocalization of newly-synthesized peroxisomal proteins and resulted in an alteration of peroxisome morphology.


CONCLUSIONS
these observations suggest that arf <dig> is a key player in mammalian peroxisome biogenesis. in addition, they also lend strong support to and extend the concept that specific arf isoform pairs may act in tandem to regulate exclusive trafficking pathways.
