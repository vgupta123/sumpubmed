BACKGROUND
fibronectin  <dig> , a glycoprotein component of the extracellular matrix, exerts different functions during reproductive processes such as fertilisation, gastrulation and implantation. fn <dig> expression has been described to increase significantly from the morula towards the early blastocyst stage, suggesting that fn <dig> may also be involved in early blastocyst formation. by alternative splicing at  <dig> defined regions, different fn <dig> isoforms are generated, each with a unique biological function. the analysis of the alternative fn <dig> splicing on the one hand and the search for candidate fn <dig> receptors on the other hand during early bovine embryo development may reveal more about its function during bovine preimplantation embryo development.


RESULTS
rt-qpcr quantification of the fn <dig> splice isoforms in oocytes, embryos, cumulus cells and adult tissue samples revealed a large variation in overall fn <dig> expression and in splice variant expression. moreover, two new fn <dig> transcript variants were identified, the first one expressed in bovine preimplantation embryos and the second one expressed in cumulus cells.

in the search for candidate receptors for the new embryo specific fn <dig> isoform, rna expression analysis identified  <dig> α integrin subunits  and  <dig> β integrin subunits  with a similar or overlapping rna expression pattern as compared to fn <dig>  but double immunofluorescent stainings could not confirm complete co-localisation between fn <dig> and one out of  <dig> selected integrins alpha subunits .


CONCLUSIONS
the existence of a new fn <dig> transcript variant, specifically expressed in morulae and blastocysts strengthens the idea that fn <dig> is involved in the process of compaction and blastocyst formation. analysis of the integrin expression could not identify the binding partner for the embryo specific fn <dig> transcript variant making further steps necessary for the identification of the fn <dig> receptor and the downstream effects of fn1-receptor binding.
