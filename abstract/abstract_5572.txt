BACKGROUND
the kdpd/kdpe two-component system of escherichia coli regulates expression of the kdpfabc operon encoding the high affinity k+ transport system kdpfabc. the input domain of kdpd comprises a domain that belongs to the family of universal stress proteins . it has been previously demonstrated that uspc binds to this domain, resulting in kdpd/kdpe scaffolding under salt stress. however the mechanistic significance of this domain for signaling remains unclear. here, we employed a "domain swapping" approach to replace the kdpd-usp domain with four homologous domains or with the six soluble usp proteins of e. coli.


RESULTS
full response to salt stress was only achieved with a chimera that contains uspc, probably due to unaffected scaffolding of the kdpd/kdpe signaling cascade by soluble uspc. unexpectedly, chimeras containing either uspf or uspg not only prevented kdpfabc expression under salt stress but also under k+ limiting conditions, although these hybrid proteins exhibited kinase and phosphotransferase activities in vitro. these are the first kdpd derivatives that do not respond to k+ limitation due to alterations in the n-terminal domain. analysis of the kdpd-usp tertiary structure revealed that this domain has a net positively charged surface, while uspf and uspg are characterized by net negative surface charges.


CONCLUSIONS
the usp domain within kdpd not only functions as a binding surface for the scaffold uspc, but it is also important for kdpd signaling. we propose that kdpd sensing/signaling involves alterations of electrostatic interactions between the large n- and c-terminal cytoplasmic domains.
