BACKGROUND
secretoglobin 1a <dig> , also called clara cell secretory protein, is the most abundantly secreted protein of the airway. the scgb1a <dig> gene has been characterized in mammals as a single copy in the genome. however, analysis of the equine genome suggested that horses might have multiple scgb1a <dig> gene copies. non-ciliated lung epithelial cells produce scgb 1a <dig> during inhalation of noxious substances to counter airway inflammation. airway fluid and lung tissue of horses with recurrent airway obstruction , a chronic inflammatory lung disease affecting mature horses similar to environmentally induced asthma of humans, have reduced total scgb 1a <dig> concentration. herein, we investigated whether horses have distinct expressed scgb1a <dig> genes; whether the transcripts are differentially expressed in tissues and in inflammatory lung disease; and whether there is cell specific protein expression in tissues.


RESULTS
we identified three scgb1a <dig> gene copies on equine chromosome  <dig>  contained within a 512-kilobase region. bioinformatic analysis showed that scgb1a <dig> genes differ from each other by  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides, and that they code for different proteins. transcripts were detected for scgb1a <dig> and scgb1a1a, but not for scgb1a1p. the scgb1a1p gene had most inter-individual variability and contained a non-sense mutation in many animals, suggesting that scgb1a1p has evolved into a pseudogene. analysis of scgb1a <dig> and scgb1a1a sequences by endpoint-limiting dilution pcr identified a consistent difference affecting 3 bp within exon  <dig>  which served as a gene-specific “signature”. assessment of gene- and organ-specific expression by semiquantitative rt-pcr of  <dig> tissues showed strong expression of scgb1a <dig> and scgb1a1a in lung, uterus, fallopian tube and mammary gland, which correlated with detection of scgb 1a <dig> protein by immunohistochemistry. significantly altered expression of the ratio of scgb1a1a to scgb1a <dig> was detected in rao-affected animals compared to controls, suggesting different roles for scgb 1a <dig> and scgb 1a1a in this inflammatory condition.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of three scgb1a <dig> genes in a mammal. the two expressed genes code for proteins predicted to differ in function. alterations in the gene expression ratio in rao suggest cell and tissue specific regulation and functions. these findings may be important for understanding of lung and reproductive conditions.
