BACKGROUND
avian pathogenic escherichia coli strains cause extraintestinal diseases in birds, leading to substantial economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. bacteria that invade cells can overcome the host humoral immune response, resulting in a higher pathogenicity potential. invasins are members of a large family of outer membrane proteins that allow pathogen invasion into host cells by interacting with specific receptors on the cell surface.


RESULTS
an in silico analysis of the genome of a septicemic apec strain  demonstrated the presence of a putative invasin homologous to the ycho gene from e. coli str. k- <dig> substr. mg <dig>  in vitro and in vivo assays comparing a mutant strain carrying a null mutation of this gene, a complemented strain, and its counterpart wild-type strain showed that ycho plays a role in the pathogenicity of apec strain sept <dig>  in vitro assays demonstrated that the mutant strain exhibited significant decreases in bacterial adhesiveness and invasiveness in chicken cells and biofilm formation. in vivo assay indicated a decrease in pathogenicity of the mutant strain. moreover, transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the ycho deletion affected the expression of  <dig> genes. among the altered genes,  <dig>  % were downregulated in the mutant, including membrane proteins and metabolism genes.


CONCLUSIONS
the results led us to propose that gene ycho contributes to the pathogenicity of apec strain sept <dig> influencing, in a pleiotropic manner, many biological characteristics, such as adhesion and invasion of in vitro cultured cells, biofilm formation and motility, which could be due to the possible membrane location of this protein. all of these results suggest that the absence of gene ycho would influence the virulence of the apec strain herein studied.
