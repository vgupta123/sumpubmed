BACKGROUND
the koji mold, aspergillus oryzae is widely used for the production of industrial enzymes due to its particularly high protein secretion capacity and ability to perform post-translational modifications. however, systemic analysis of its secretion system is lacking, generally due to the poorly annotated proteome.


RESULTS
here we defined a functional protein secretory component list of a. oryzae using a previously reported secretory model of s. cerevisiae as scaffold. additional secretory components were obtained by blast search with the functional components reported in other closely related fungal species such as aspergillus nidulans and aspergillus niger. to evaluate the defined component list, we performed transcriptome analysis on three α-amylase over-producing strains with varying levels of secretion capacities. specifically, secretory components involved in the er-associated processes  were significantly up-regulated, with many of them never been identified for a. oryzae before. furthermore, we defined a complete list of the putative a. oryzae secretome and monitored how it was affected by overproducing amylase.


CONCLUSIONS
in combination with the transcriptome data, the most complete secretory component list and the putative secretome, we improved the systemic understanding of the secretory machinery of a. oryzae in response to high levels of protein secretion. the roles of many newly predicted secretory components were experimentally validated and the enriched component list provides a better platform for driving more mechanistic studies of the protein secretory pathway in this industrially important fungus.
