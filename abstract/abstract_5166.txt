BACKGROUND
the genome of the human gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori encodes a large number of dna methyltransferases , some of which are shared among many strains, and others of which are unique to a given strain. the mtases have potential roles in the survival of the bacterium. in this study, we sequenced a malaysian h. pylori clinical strain, designated um <dig>  by using a combination of pacbio single molecule, real-time  and illumina miseq next generation sequencing platforms, and used the smrt data to characterize the set of methylated bases .


RESULTS
the n4-methylcytosine and n6-methyladenine modifications detected at single-base resolution using smrt technology revealed  <dig> methylated sequence motifs corresponding to one type i and  <dig> type ii restriction-modification  systems. previously unassigned methylation motifs were now assigned to their respective mtases-coding genes. furthermore, one gene that appears to be inactive in the h. pylori um <dig> genome during normal growth was characterized by cloning.


CONCLUSIONS
consistent with previously-studied h. pylori strains, we show that strain um <dig> contains a relatively large number of r-m systems, including some mtase activities with novel specificities. additional studies are underway to further elucidating the biological significance of the r-m systems in the physiology and pathogenesis of h. pylori.
