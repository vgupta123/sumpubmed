BACKGROUND
gliomas are "intraparenchymally metastatic" tumors, invading the brain in a non-destructive way that suggests cooperation between glioma cells and their environment. recent studies using an engineered rodent c <dig> tumor cell line have pointed to mechanisms of invasion that involved gap junctional communication , with connexin  <dig> as a substrate. we explored whether this concept may have clinical relevance by analyzing the participation of gjc in human glioblastoma invasion.


RESULTS
three complementary in vitro assays were used:  seeding on collagen iv, to analyze homocellular interactions between tumor cells  co-cultures with astrocytes, to study glioblastoma/astrocytes relationships and  implantation into organotypic brain slice cultures, that mimic the three-dimensional parenchymal environment. carbenoxolone, a potent blocker of gjc, inhibited cell migration in the two latter models. it paradoxically increased it in the first one. these results showed that homocellular interaction between tumor cells supports intercellular adhesion, whereas heterocellular glioblastoma/astrocytes interactions through functional gjc conversely support tumor cell migration. as demonstrated for the rodent cell line, connexin  <dig> may be responsible for this heterocellular functional coupling. its levels of expression, high in astrocytes, correlated positively with invasiveness in biopsied tumors.


CONCLUSIONS
our results underscore the potential clinical relevance of the concept put forward by other authors based on experiments with a rodent cell line, that glioblastoma cells use astrocytes as a substrate for their migration by subverting communication through connexin 43-dependent gap junctions.
