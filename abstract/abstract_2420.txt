BACKGROUND
white mold, caused by sclerotinia sclerotiorum, is one of the most important diseases of pea , however, little is known about the genetics and biochemistry of this interaction. identification of genes underlying resistance in the host or pathogenicity and virulence factors in the pathogen will increase our knowledge of the pea-s. sclerotiorum interaction and facilitate the introgression of new resistance genes into commercial pea varieties. although the s. sclerotiorum genome sequence is available, no pea genome is available, due in part to its large genome size  and extensive repeated motifs. here we present an est data set specific to the interaction between s. sclerotiorum and pea, and a method to distinguish pathogen and host sequences without a species-specific reference genome.


RESULTS
 <dig>  contigs were obtained by de novo assembly of  <dig>  high-quality reads generated by  <dig> pyrosequencing of the pea-s. sclerotiorum interactome. a method based on the tblastx program was modified to distinguish pea and s. sclerotiorum ests. to test this strategy, a mixture of known ests  from public databases were pooled and parsed; the tblastx method successfully separated  <dig> % of the artificial est mix with  <dig> % accuracy. the tblastx method successfully parsed  <dig> % of the 454-derived est contigs, as validated by pcr, into pea  and s. sclerotiorum  categories. two thousand eight hundred and forty pea ests and 996 s. sclerotiorum ests were predicted to be expressed specifically during the pea-s. sclerotiorum interaction as determined by homology search against  <dig>  pea ests  and  <dig>  s. sclerotiorum ests . among those ests specifically expressed,  <dig>  pea ests were predicted to be involved in plant defense and response to biotic or abiotic stress, and  <dig>  s. sclerotiorum ests were predicted to be involved in pathogenicity/virulence. additionally, 142 s. sclerotiorum ests were identified as secretory/signal peptides of which only  <dig> were previously reported.


CONCLUSIONS
we present and characterize an est resource specific to the pea-s. sclerotiorum interaction. additionally, the tblastx method used to parse s. sclerotiorum and pea ests was demonstrated to be a reliable and accurate method to distinguish ests without a reference genome.
