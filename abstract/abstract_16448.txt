BACKGROUND
allergic sensitisation has been ascribed to a dysregulated relationship between allergen-specific th <dig>  th <dig> and regulatory t cells. we hypothesised that the relationship between these t cell subsets could be better defined using a short-term allergen stimulation system followed by direct analysis of cd154-positive t cells. using peripheral blood samples from birch pollinosis patients and healthy non-atopic controls, we sought to explore the frequencies and phenotype of birch-stimulated cd154-positive t helper cells following ex vivo birch allergen stimulation.


RESULTS
activated cd154-positive th <dig>  th <dig> and tr1-like cells, that co-expressed ifnγ, il- <dig> and il- <dig> respectively, were identified in both birch-allergic and non-allergic participants. we observed a close correlation between th <dig>  th <dig> and tr1-like cell frequency in non-allergic volunteers, such that the three parameters increased together to maintain a low th2: th <dig> ratio. the relationship between th <dig>  th <dig> and tr1-like responses was dysregulated in birch-allergic patients, with abrogation of the il- <dig> response and a higher th2: th <dig> ratio. a close correlation was observed between th <dig> cell frequency and the absolute concentration of birch-specific ige within the birch-allergic group, and we confirmed previous reports of a more differentiated t cell phenotype in allergic subjects.


CONCLUSIONS
the findings demonstrate an important balance between ifnγ, il- <dig> and il-10 t cell responses to birch allergen in health, where th <dig> responses to allergens were frequently observed, but apparently balanced by th <dig> and regulatory responses. the detection of cd <dig> positive t cells after short-term antigen stimulation may be a useful method for the detection of t cell responses to allergens when cost, speed and convenience are priorities.
