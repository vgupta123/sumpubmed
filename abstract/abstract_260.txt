BACKGROUND
common bean  is one of the most important legumes in the world. several diseases severely reduce bean production and quality; therefore, it is very important to better understand disease resistance in common bean in order to prevent these losses. more than  <dig> resistance  genes which confer resistance against various pathogens have been cloned from diverse plant species. most r genes share highly conserved domains which facilitates the identification of new candidate r genes from the same species or other species. the goals of this study were to isolate expressed r gene-like sequences  from 454-derived transcriptomic sequences and expressed sequence tags  of common bean, and to develop rgl-tagged molecular markers.


RESULTS
a data-mining approach was used to identify tentative p. vulgaris r gene-like sequences from approximately  <dig>  million 454-derived sequences and  <dig>  ests deposited in genbank. a total of  <dig> non-redundant sequences were identified and named as common bean  resistance gene-like sequences . among the identified pvrgls, about 60%  were from 454-derived sequences. reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  analysis confirmed that pvrgls were actually expressed in the leaves of common bean. upon comparison to p. vulgaris genomic sequences,  <dig>  of the  <dig> tentative pvrgls could be integrated into the existing common bean physical map. based on the syntenic blocks between common bean and soybean,  <dig>  pvrgls were anchored on the p. vulgaris genetic map and will need to be mapped to determine order. in addition,  <dig> sequence-tagged-site  and  <dig> cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence  molecular markers were developed for  <dig> unique pvrgls.


CONCLUSIONS
in total,  <dig> pvrgls were successfully identified from 454-derived transcriptomic sequences and ests available in genbank and about 65% of pvrgls were integrated into the common bean genetic map. a total of  <dig> rgl-tagged markers were developed for  <dig> unique pvrgls, including  <dig> sts and  <dig> caps markers. the expressed pvrgls identified in this study provide a large sequence resource for development of rgl-tagged markers that could be used further for genetic mapping of disease resistant candidate genes and quantitative trait locus/loci . this work also represents an additional method for identifying expressed rgls from next generation sequencing data.
