BACKGROUND
the forces underlying genome architecture and organization are still only poorly understood in detail. overlapping genes  represent a genomic feature that is shared widely across biological organisms ranging from viruses to multi-cellular organisms. in bacteria, a third of the annotated genes are involved in an overlap. despite the widespread nature of this arrangement, its evolutionary origins and biological ramifications have so far eluded explanation.


RESULTS
here we present a comparative approach using information from  <dig> bacterial genomes that sheds light on the evolutionary dynamics of overlapping genes. we show that these structures exhibit high levels of plasticity.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose a simple model allowing us to explain the observed properties of overlapping genes based on the importance of initiation and termination of transcriptional and translational processes. we believe that taking into account the processes leading to the expression of protein-coding genes hold the key to the understanding of overlapping genes structures.
