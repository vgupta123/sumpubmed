BACKGROUND
vj recombinations in lymphocytes are essential for immunological diversity. they are also useful markers of pathologies. in leukemia, they are used to quantify the minimal residual disease during patient follow-up. however, the full breadth of lymphocyte diversity is not fully understood.


RESULTS
we propose new algorithms that process high-throughput sequencing  data to extract unnamed vj junctions and gather them into clones for quantification. this analysis is based on a seed heuristic and is fast and scalable because in the first phase, no alignment is performed with germline database sequences. the algorithms were applied to tr γ hts data from a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and also on data simulating hypermutations. our methods identified the main clone, as well as additional clones that were not identified with standard protocols.


CONCLUSIONS
the proposed algorithms provide new insight into the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data for leukemia, and also to the quantitative assessment of any immunological profile. the methods described here are implemented in a c++ open-source program called vidjil.
