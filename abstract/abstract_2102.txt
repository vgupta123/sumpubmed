BACKGROUND
the arabidopsis microrna <dig>  regulates  <dig> members of the squamosa promoter binding protein like  family by base pairing to complementary target mrnas. each spl gene further regulates a set of other genes; thus, mir <dig> controls numerous genes through a complex gene regulation network. increased axillary branching occurs in transgenic arabidopsis overexpressing mir156b, similar to that observed in loss-of-function max <dig> and max <dig> mutants with lesions in carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases. arabidopsis mir156b was found to enhance carotenoid levels and reproductive shoot branching when expressed in brassica napus, suggesting a link between mir156b expression and carotenoid metabolism. however, details of the mir <dig> regulatory network of spl genes related to carotenoid metabolism are not known.


RESULTS
in this study, an arabidopsis t-dna enhancer mutant, sk <dig>  was identified due to its altered branching and trichome morphology and increased seed carotenoid levels compared to wild type  ecovar columbia. enhanced mir156b expression due to the 35s enhancers present on the t-dna insert was responsible for these phenotypes. constitutive and leaf primodium-specific expression of a mir156-insensitive  spl <dig>  largely restored wt seed carotenoid levels and plant morphology when expressed in sk <dig>  the arabidopsis native mir156-sensitive spl <dig>  and spl15m driven by a native spl <dig> promoter did not restore the wt phenotype in sk <dig>  our findings suggest that spl <dig> function is somewhat redundant with other spl family members, which collectively affect plant phenotypes. moreover, substantially decreased mir156b transcript levels in sk <dig> expressing spl15m, together with the presence of multiple repeats of spl-binding gtac core sequence close to the mir156b transcription start site, suggested feedback regulation of mir156b expression by spl <dig>  this was supported by the demonstration of specific in vitro interaction between dna-binding sbp domain of spl <dig> and the proximal promoter sequence of mir156b.


CONCLUSIONS
enhanced mir156b expression in sk <dig> leads to the mutant phenotype including carotenoid levels in the seed through suppression of spl <dig> and other spl target genes. moreover, spl <dig> has a regulatory role not only for downstream components, but also for its own upstream regulator mir156b.
