BACKGROUND
sdw1/denso is one of the most important and useful semi-dwarf genes in barley breeding. at least four sdw1/denso alleles have been reported and hvga20ox <dig> is considered as the candidate gene. up to date, results of studies have not univocally proven the genetic relationship between sdw1/denso and hvga20ox <dig> 


RESULTS
in the present study, a complete deletion of morex_contig_ <dig> including both hvga20ox <dig> and mloc_ <dig> genes was identified at the sdw <dig> locus from a semi-dwarf mutant riso no.  <dig>  expression of the genes encoding gibberellin biosynthesis  were increased in the mutant compared to the wild type bomi, while the expression of ga catabolic gene hvga2ox <dig> was decreased. over-expression of hvga20ox <dig> could rescue the semi-dwarf phenotype and increase gas concentration.


CONCLUSIONS
we confirmed that a ga biosynthetic enzyme hvga20ox <dig>  acted as ga 20-oxidase, is the functional gene for the sdw1/denso semi-dwarfism. lose of hvga20ox <dig> is partially compensated by hvga20ox <dig> and further feedback is regulated by gibberellin. we also deduced that the sdw1/denso allele itself affects later heading owing to its reduced endogenous gas concentration.
