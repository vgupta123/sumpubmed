BACKGROUND
microglial activation and the proinflammatory response are controlled by a complex regulatory network. among the various candidates, macrophage colony-stimulating factor  is considered an important cytokine. the up-regulation of m-csf and its receptor csf-1r has been reported in brain disease, as well as in diabetic complications; however, the mechanism is unclear. an elevated level of glycated albumin  is a characteristic of diabetes; thus, it may be involved in monocyte/macrophage-associated diabetic complications.


RESULTS
the basal level of expression of m-csf/csf-1r was examined in retinal microglial cells in vitro. immunofluorescence, real-time pcr, immunoprecipitation, and western blot analyses revealed the up-regulation of csf-1r in ga-treated microglial cells. we also detected increased expression and release of m-csf, suggesting that the cytokine is produced by activated microglia via autocrine signaling. using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we found that ga affects microglial activation by stimulating the release of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β. furthermore, the neutralization of m-csf or csf-1r with antibodies suppressed the proinflammatory response. conversely, this proinflammatory response was augmented by the administration of m-csf.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that ga induces microglial activation via the release of proinflammatory cytokines, which may contribute to the inflammatory pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. the increased microglial expression of m-csf/csf-1r not only is a response to microglial activation in diabetic retinopathy but also augments the microglial inflammation responsible for the diabetic microenvironment.
