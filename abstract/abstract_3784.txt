BACKGROUND
soybean, glycine max  merr., is a well documented paleopolyploid. what remains relatively under characterized is the level of sequence identity in retained homeologous regions of the genome. recently, the department of energy joint genome institute and united states department of agriculture jointly announced the sequencing of the soybean genome. one of the initial concerns is to what extent sequence identity in homeologous regions would have on whole genome shotgun sequence assembly.


RESULTS
seventeen bacs representing ~ <dig>  mb were sequenced as representative potential homeologous regions from the soybean genome. genetic mapping of each bac shows that  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes are represented. sequence comparisons between homeologous bacs shows that the soybean genome is a mosaic of retained paleopolyploid regions. some regions appear to be highly conserved while other regions have diverged significantly. large-scale "batch" reassembly of all  <dig> bacs combined showed that even the most homeologous bacs with upwards of 95% sequence identity resolve into their respective homeologous sequences. potential assembly errors were generated by tandemly duplicated pentatricopeptide repeat containing genes and long simple sequence repeats. analysis of a whole-genome shotgun assembly of  <dig>  randomly chosen jgi-doe sequence traces reveals some new soybean-specific repeat sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
this analysis investigated both the structure of the paleopolyploid soybean genome and the potential effects retained homeology will have on assembling the whole genome shotgun sequence. based upon these results, homeologous regions similar to those characterized here will not cause major assembly issues.
