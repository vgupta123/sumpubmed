BACKGROUND
the genetic heterogeneity of sensorineural hearing loss is a major hurdle to the efficient discovery of disease-causing genes. we designed a multiphasic analysis of copy number variation , linkage, and single nucleotide variation  of whole exome sequencing  data for the efficient discovery of mutations causing nonsyndromic hearing loss .


RESULTS
from wes data, we identified five distinct cnv loci from a nshl family, but they were not co-segregated among patients. linkage analysis based on snvs identified six candidate loci . we selected  <dig> snvs that co-segregated with nshl in the family, which were located in six linkage candidate loci. finally, the novel variant p.m305t in actg <dig>  was selected as a disease-causing variant.


CONCLUSIONS
here, we present a multiphasic cnv, linkage, and snv analysis of wes data for the identification of a candidate mutation causing nshl. our stepwise, multiphasic approach enabled us to expedite the discovery of disease-causing variants from a large number of patient variants.
