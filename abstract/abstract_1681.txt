BACKGROUND
soybean cyst nematode  is the most economically devastating pathogen of soybean. two resistance loci, rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> primarily contribute resistance to scn race  <dig> in soybean. peking and pi  <dig> are the two major sources of scn resistance with peking requiring both rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> alleles and pi  <dig> only the rhg <dig> allele. although simple sequence repeat  markers have been reported for both loci, they are linked markers and limited to be applied in breeding programs due to accuracy, throughput and cost of detection methods. the objectives of this study were to develop robust functional marker assays for high-throughput selection of scn resistance and to differentiate the sources of resistance.


RESULTS
based on the genomic dna sequences of  <dig> soybean lines with known scn phenotypes, we have developed kompetitive allele specific pcr  assays for two single nucleotide polymorphisms  from glyma08g <dig> for the selection of the rhg <dig> resistance allele. moreover, the genomic dna of glyma18g <dig> at the rhg <dig> locus from  <dig> soybean lines and cdna of forrest, essex, williams  <dig> and pi  <dig> were fully sequenced. pairwise sequence alignment revealed seven snps/insertion/deletions , five in the 6th exon and two in the last exon. using the same  <dig> soybean lines, we identified one snp that can be used to select the rhg <dig> resistance allele and another snp that can be employed to differentiate peking and pi 88788-type resistance. these snp markers have been validated and a strong correlation was observed between the snp genotypes and reactions to scn race  <dig> using a panel of  <dig> soybean lines, as well as a bi-parental population, f5–derived recombinant inbred lines  from g00- <dig> x lg04- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
three functional snp markers  were identified that could provide genotype information for the selection of scn resistance and differentiate peking from pi  <dig> source for most germplasm lines. the robust kasp snp marker assays were developed. in most contexts, use of one or two of these markers is sufficient for high-throughput marker-assisted selection of plants that will exhibit scn resistance.
