BACKGROUND
toll-like receptor  <dig>  plays a critical role in mediating inflammatory/immune responses against bacterial pathogens in lung. streptococcus pneumoniae  and nontypeable haemophilus influenzae  were previously reported to synergize with each other to induce inflammatory responses. despite the relatively known intracellular signaling pathways involved in the synergistic induction of inflammation, it is still unclear if both bacterial pathogens also synergistically induce expression of surface tlr <dig> 


RESULTS
here we provide direct evidence that s. pneumoniae synergizes with nthi to upregulate tlr <dig> expression in lung and middle ear of the mice. pneumolysin  appears to be the major virulence factor involved in this synergism. moreover, s. pneumoniae ply induces tlr <dig> expression via a tlr4-myd88-nf-κb-dependent signaling pathway. interestingly, tumor suppressor cyld acts as a negative regulator of s. pneumoniae-induced tlr <dig> up-regulation via negative-crosstalk with nf-κb signaling.


CONCLUSIONS
our study thus provides novel insights into the regulation of tlr <dig> expression in mixed bacterial infections.
