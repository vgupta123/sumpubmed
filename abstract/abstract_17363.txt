BACKGROUND
bovine congenital pseudomyotonia  is an impairment of muscle relaxation induced by exercise preventing animals from performing rapid movements. forms of recessively inherited pmt have been described in different cattle breeds caused by two independent mutations in atp2a <dig> encoding a skeletal-muscle ca2+-atpase . we observed symptoms of congenital pmt in four related romagnola beef cattle from italy and evaluated serca <dig> activity and scanned atp2a <dig> for possible causative mutations.


RESULTS
we obtained four pmt affected romagnola cattle and noted striking clinical similarities to the previously described pmt cases in other cattle breeds. the affected animals had a reduced serca <dig> activity in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. a single affected animal was homozygous for a novel complex variant in atp2a <dig> exon  <dig> . three out of four cases were compound heterozygous for the newly identified exon  <dig> variant and the exon  <dig> variant c. <dig> g>a, which has previously been shown to cause pmt in chianina cattle. pedigree analysis showed that the exon  <dig> double mutation event dates back to at least  <dig>  both nucleotide substitutions are predicted to alter the serca <dig> amino acid sequence ]), affect highly conserved residues, in particular the actuator domain of serca <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
clinical, biochemical and dna analyses confirmed the initial hypothesis. we provide functional and genetic evidence that one novel and one previously described atp2a <dig> mutation lead to a reduced serca <dig> activity in skeletal muscles and pseudomyotonia in affected romagnola cattle. selection against these mutations can now be used to eliminate the mutant alleles from the romagnola breed.
