BACKGROUND
imatinib represents the first in a class of drugs targeted against chronic myelogenous leukemia to enter the clinic, showing excellent efficacy and specificity for abl, kit, and pdgfr kinases. recent screens carried out to find off-target proteins that bind to imatinib identified the oxidoreductase nqo <dig>  a flavoprotein that is phosphorylated in a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line.


RESULTS
we examined the inhibition of nqo <dig> activity by the abl kinase inhibitors imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, and obtained ic <dig> values of  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm, and > <dig> μm, respectively. using electronic absorption spectroscopy, we show that imatinib binding results in a perturbation of the protein environment around the flavin prosthetic group in nqo <dig>  we have determined the crystal structure of the complex of imatinib with human nqo <dig> at  <dig>  Å resolution, which reveals that imatinib binds in the enzyme active site, adjacent to the flavin isoalloxazine ring. we find that phosphorylation of nqo <dig> has little effect on enzyme activity and is therefore likely to regulate other aspects of nqo <dig> function.


CONCLUSIONS
the structure of the imatinib-nqo <dig> complex demonstrates that imatinib inhibits nqo <dig> activity by competing with substrate for the active site. the overall conformation of imatinib when bound to nqo <dig> resembles the folded conformation observed in some kinase complexes. interactions made by imatinib with residues at the rim of the active site provide an explanation for the binding selectivity of nqo <dig> for imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib. these interactions also provide a rationale for the lack of inhibition of the related oxidoreductase nqo <dig> by these compounds. taken together, these studies provide insight into the mechanism of nqo <dig> inhibition by imatinib, with potential implications for drug design and treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia in patients.
