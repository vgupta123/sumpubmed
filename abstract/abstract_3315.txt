BACKGROUND
the vomeronasal organ  detects pheromones via two large families of vomeronasal receptors: vomeronasal receptor  <dig>  and vomeronasal receptor  <dig> . both vrs have a common receptor activation cascade involving transient receptor potential channel, subfamily c, member  <dig> .


RESULTS
we characterised the trpc <dig> locus in a marsupial, the tammar wallaby , and identified two independently regulated genes not previously recognised as distinct. 3'-located exons comprise bona fide trpc <dig> whilst 5'-located exons, previously identified as part of trpc <dig>  comprise a distinct gene, which we term xndr . the two genes show contrasting expression patterns in the tammar: trpc <dig> is specifically expressed in adult and developing vno, whereas xndr is widely expressed in many tissues suggesting a non-vno-specific role. strong expression of trpc <dig> was detected only after about day  <dig> post-partum, suggesting that the vno may not be functional during early pouch life of the tammar. similarly restricted expression of trpc <dig> and widespread expression of xndr was also detected in the platypus. bioinformatic analysis of the genomes of a wide range of species suggests that the identity of xndr and trpc <dig> as distinct genes is conserved among vertebrates. finally, we analysed the promoter of mammalian trpc <dig> and identified a conserved binding site for nhlh <dig>  a transcription factor previously implicated in vno receptor neuron development.


CONCLUSIONS
two functionally distinct vertebrate genes-xndr and trpc <dig> - occupy a genomic locus that was previously defined as a single gene in the mouse. the former is widely expressed with a putative role in dna repair, while the latter shows vno-specific expression under the probable regulation of nhlh <dig>
