BACKGROUND
sesame  is one of the most important oil crops; however, a lack of useful molecular markers hinders current genetic research. we performed transcriptome sequencing of samples from different sesame growth and developmental stages, and mining of genic-ssr markers to identify valuable markers for sesame molecular genetics research.


RESULTS
in this study, 75 bp and 100 bp paired-end rna-seq was used to sequence  <dig> cdna libraries, and  <dig>  uni-transcripts were assembled from more than  <dig> million filtered reads. the total length of uni-transcript sequences was  <dig>  mb, and  <dig>  ssrs  and  <dig>  ssrs  were identified. on average, there was one genic-ssr per  <dig>  kb  or  <dig>  kb . among perfect ssrs , di-nucleotide motifs  were the most abundant, followed by tri- , hexa- , penta- , tetra- , and mono-nucleotides . the top four motif repeats were n , n , n , and n . a total of  <dig>  ssr primer pairs were identified in the  <dig>  ssr-containing sequences , and  <dig> ssr primer pairs were randomly chosen for validation. these ssr markers were amplified and validated in  <dig> sesame accessions .  <dig>  primer pairs yielded pcr amplification products in  <dig> cultivars. thirty two primer pairs  exhibited polymorphisms. moreover,  <dig> primer pairs  yielded pcr amplicons in the wild accession and  <dig>  were polymorphic between species. a upgma dendrogram based on genetic similarity coefficients showed that the correlation between genotype and geographical source was low and that the genetic basis of sesame in china is narrow, as previously reported. the  <dig> polymorphic primer pairs were validated using an f <dig> mapping population;  <dig> primer pairs exhibited polymorphisms between the parents, and  <dig> genic-ssrs could be integrated into  <dig> main linkage groups.


CONCLUSIONS
 <dig>  genic-ssr markers have been developed in sesame using transcriptome sequencing.  <dig> of  <dig> validated primer pairs successfully yielded pcr amplicons in  <dig> cultivated sesame accessions. these markers increase current ssr marker resources and will greatly benefit genetic diversity, qualitative and quantitative trait mapping and marker-assisted selection studies in sesame.
