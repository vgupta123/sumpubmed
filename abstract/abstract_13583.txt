BACKGROUND
primitive endoderm is a cell lineage segregated from the epiblast in the blastocyst and gives rise to parietal and visceral endoderm. sox <dig> is a member of the soxf gene family that is specifically expressed in primitive endoderm in the late blastocyst, although its function in this cell lineage remains unclear.


RESULTS
here we characterize the function of sox <dig> in primitive endoderm differentiation using mouse embryonic stem  cells as a model system. we show that ectopic expression of sox <dig> in es cells has a marginal effect on triggering differentiation into primitive endoderm-like cells. we also show that targeted disruption of sox <dig> in es cells does not affect differentiation into primitive endoderm cells in embryoid body formation as well as by forced expression of gata <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these data indicate that sox <dig> function is supplementary and not essential for this differentiation from es cells.
