BACKGROUND
we present a genome-wide messenger rna  sequencing technique that converts small amounts of rna from many samples into molecular phenotypes. it encompasses all steps from sample preparation to sequence analysis and is applicable to baseline profiling or perturbation measurements.


RESULTS
multiplex sequencing of transcript 3′ ends identifies differential transcript abundance independent of gene annotation. we show that increasing biological replicate number while maintaining the total amount of sequencing identifies more differentially abundant transcripts.


CONCLUSIONS
this method can be implemented on polyadenylated rna from any organism with an annotated reference genome and in any laboratory with access to illumina sequencing.
