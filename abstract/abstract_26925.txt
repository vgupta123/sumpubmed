BACKGROUND
malate synthase catalyzes the second step of the glyoxylate bypass, the condensation of acetyl coenzyme a and glyoxylate to form malate and coenzyme a . in several microorganisms, the glyoxylate bypass is of general importance to microbial pathogenesis. the predicted malate synthase g of pseudomonas aeruginosa has also been implicated in virulence of this opportunistic pathogen.


RESULTS
here, we report the verification of the malate synthase activity of this predicted protein and its recombinant production in e. coli, purification and biochemical characterization. the malate synthase g of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> has a temperature and ph optimum of  <dig> Â°c and  <dig> , respectively. although displaying normal thermal stability, the enzyme was stable up to incubation at ph  <dig>  the following kinetic parameters of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> malate synthase g were obtained: km glyoxylate , km acetyl coa  and vmax . in addition, deletion of the corresponding gene showed that it is a prerequisite for growth on acetate as sole carbon source.


CONCLUSIONS
the implication of the glyoxylate bypass in the pathology of various microorganisms makes malate synthase g an attractive new target for antibacterial therapy. the purification procedure and biochemical characterization assist in the development of antibacterial components directed against this target in p. aeruginosa.
