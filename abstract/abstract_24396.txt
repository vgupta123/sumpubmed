BACKGROUND
cerebral ischemia results in a rapid increase in contractile cerebrovascular receptors, such as the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 1b , angiotensin ii type  <dig> , and endothelin type b  receptors, in the vessel walls within the ischemic region, which further impairs local blood flow and aggravates tissue damage. this receptor upregulation occurs via activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. we therefore hypothesized an important role for b-raf, the first signaling molecule in the pathway. to test our hypothesis, human cerebral arteries were incubated at 37Â°c for  <dig> h in the absence or presence of a b-raf inhibitor: sb- <dig> or sb- <dig>  contractile properties were evaluated in a myograph and protein expression of the individual receptors and activated phosphorylated b-raf  was evaluated immunohistochemically.


RESULTS
5-ht1b, at <dig>  and etb receptor-mediated contractions were significantly reduced by application of sb- <dig>  and to a smaller extent by sb- <dig>  a marked reduction in at <dig> receptor immunoreactivity was observed after treatment with sb- <dig>  treatment with sb- <dig> and sb- <dig> diminished the culture-induced increase of p-b-raf immunoreactivity.


CONCLUSIONS
b-raf signaling has a key function in the altered expression of vascular contractile receptors observed after organ culture. therefore, specific targeting of b-raf might be a novel approach to reduce tissue damage after cerebral ischemia by preventing the previously observed upregulation of contractile receptors in smooth muscle cells.
