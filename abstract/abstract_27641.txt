BACKGROUND
biotic and abiotic stresses, such as powdery mildew infection and high temperature, are important limiting factors for yield and grain quality in wheat production. emerging evidences suggest that long non-protein coding rnas  are developmentally regulated and play roles in development and stress responses of plants. however, identification of long npcrnas is limited to a few plant species, such as arabidopsis, rice and maize, no systematic identification of long npcrnas and their responses to abiotic and biotic stresses is reported in wheat.


RESULTS
in this study, by using computational analysis and experimental approach we identified  <dig> putative wheat stress responsive long npcrnas, which are not conserved among plant species. among them, some were precursors of small rnas such as micrornas and sirnas, two long npcrnas were identified as signal recognition particle  7s rna variants, and three were characterized as u <dig> snornas. we found that wheat long npcrnas showed tissue dependent expression patterns and were responsive to powdery mildew infection and heat stress.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicated that diverse sets of wheat long npcrnas were responsive to powdery mildew infection and heat stress, and could function in wheat responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses, which provided a starting point to understand their functions and regulatory mechanisms in the future.
