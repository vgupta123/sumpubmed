BACKGROUND
members of plant wrky transcription factor families are widely implicated in defense responses and various other physiological processes. for canola , no wrky genes have been described in detail. because of the economic importance of this crop, and its evolutionary relationship to arabidopsis thaliana, we sought to characterize a subset of canola wrky genes in the context of pathogen and hormone responses.


RESULTS
in this study, we identified  <dig> wrky genes from canola by mining the expressed sequence tag  database and cloned cdna sequences of  <dig> bnwrkys. a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the conserved wrky domain amino acid sequences, which demonstrated that bnwrkys can be divided into three major groups. we further compared bnwrkys to the  <dig> wrky genes from arabidopsis and  <dig> wrky from rice, and we identified  <dig> presumptive orthologs of atwrky genes. we examined the subcellular localization of four bnwrky proteins using green fluorescent protein  and we observed the fluorescent green signals in the nucleus only.

the responses of  <dig> selected bnwrky genes to two fungal pathogens, sclerotinia sclerotiorum and alternaria brassicae, were analyzed by quantitative real time-pcr . transcript abundance of  <dig> bnwrky genes changed significantly following pathogen challenge: transcripts of  <dig> wrkys increased in abundance, two wrky transcripts decreased after infection, and one decreased at  <dig> h post-infection but increased later on . we also observed that transcript abundance of 13/ <dig> bnwrky genes was responsive to one or more hormones, including abscisic acid , and cytokinin  and the defense signaling molecules jasmonic acid , salicylic acid , and ethylene . we compared these transcript expression patterns to those previously described for presumptive orthologs of these genes in arabidopsis and rice, and observed both similarities and differences in expression patterns.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified a set of  <dig> bnwrky genes from among  <dig> bnwrky genes assayed, that are responsive to both fungal pathogens and hormone treatments, suggesting shared signaling mechanisms for these responses. this study suggests that a large number of bnwrky proteins are involved in the transcriptional regulation of defense-related genes in response to fungal pathogens and hormone stimuli.
