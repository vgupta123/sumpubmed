BACKGROUND
porcine circovirus-like virus p <dig> is a newly discovered virus. to date, there has been no specific serological assay for use in the diagnosis of p <dig> infection.


RESULTS
because p <dig> has high homology to porcine circovirus type  <dig>  at the nucleotide level, the c-terminal portion of the capsid protein , a discriminative antigen, was expressed in a prokaryotic expression system. the recombinant product , composed of three identical repeated domains, was shown to be strongly immunoreactive to p1-specific serum. this assay was validated by comparison with an indirect immunofluorescence assay . the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the rctcap enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  developed in this study are  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively, compared with the results from ifas on  <dig> sera samples from pigs.


CONCLUSIONS
the indirect elisa that we developed with rctcap, the recombinant capsid fragment containing the 217–342 nt repeat domain, was sensitive, specific, and suitable for the large-scale detection of p <dig> infections in swine.
