BACKGROUND
the loggerhead shrike, eastern subspecies   is a predatory songbird native to eastern north america. it is estimated that there are fewer than  <dig> breeding pairs of this subspecies in north america. captive breeding plays a critical role in preventing the extirpation of this subspecies from its canadian range. unfortunately, high numbers of unexplained deaths among young birds in the captive breeding population threatened the success of this program. this paper describes fledgling mortality in the captive breeding population, and seeks to identify factors associated with fledgling survival and, ultimately, to identify steps to mitigate fledgling mortality.


RESULTS
over the study period  at two breeding sites,  <dig> losh were fledged. among these, 68 %  were released, 10 %  were retained in the captive breeding population, and 22 %  died. fledgling survival declined from 99 % in  <dig> to 44 % in  <dig>  the odds of survival were significantly lower for fledglings that were part of a second clutch. as the number of fledglings in a clutch increased, the odds of surviving increased significantly. as the breeding female aged from one to four years of age, there was a marked increase in the odds of a fledgling surviving, which then subsequently declined as females aged further.


CONCLUSIONS
based on our analyses, clutch number , number of fledglings in the brood, and age of breeding females were significant predictors of fledgling survival. long-term breeding management decisions will have to balance the need to increase the number of individuals and breeding pairs in the wild by releasing large numbers of young, against the need to maintain a genetically viable captive population, until the wild population is large enough to be self-sustaining.
