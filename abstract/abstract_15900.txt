BACKGROUND
physical and functional interplays between genes or proteins have important biological meaning for cellular functions. some efforts have been made to construct weighted gene association meta-networks by integrating multiple biological resources, where the weight indicates the confidence of the interaction. however, it is found that these existing human gene association networks share only quite limited overlapped interactions, suggesting their incompleteness and noise.


RESULTS
here we proposed a workflow to construct a weighted human gene association network using information of six existing networks, including two weighted specific ppi networks and four gene association meta-networks. we applied link prediction algorithm to predict possible missing links of the networks, cross-validation approach to refine each network and finally integrated the refined networks to get the final integrated network.


CONCLUSIONS
the common information among the refined networks increases notably, suggesting their higher reliability. our final integrated network owns much more links than most of the original networks, meanwhile its links still keep high functional relevance. being used as background network in a case study of disease gene prediction, the final integrated network presents good performance, implying its reliability and application significance. our workflow could be insightful for integrating and refining existing gene association data.
