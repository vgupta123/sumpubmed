BACKGROUND
geographical isolation has generated a distinct difference between atlantic salmon of european and north american atlantic origin. the european atlantic salmon generally has  <dig> pairs of chromosomes and  <dig> chromosome arms whereas it has been reported that the north american atlantic salmon has  <dig> chromosome pairs and an nf of  <dig>  in order to predict the major chromosomal rearrangements causing these differences, we constructed a dense linkage map for atlantic salmon of north american origin and compared it with the well-developed map for european atlantic salmon.


RESULTS
the presented male and female genetic maps for the north american subspecies of atlantic salmon, contains  <dig>  snps located on  <dig> linkage groups. the total lengths of the female and male linkage maps were  <dig>  cm and 968 cm respectively, with males characteristically showing recombination only at the telomeres. we compared these maps with recently published snp maps from european atlantic salmon, and predicted three chromosomal reorganization events that we then tested using fluorescence in situ hybridization  analysis. the proposed rearrangements, which define the differences in the karyotypes of the north american atlantic salmon relative to the european atlantic salmon, include the translocation of the p arm of ssa <dig> to ssa <dig> and polymorphic fusions: ssa <dig> with ssa <dig>  and ssa <dig> with ssa <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this study identified major chromosomal differences between european and north american atlantic salmon. however, while gross structural differences were significant, the order of genetic markers at the fine-resolution scale was remarkably conserved. this is a good indication that information from the international cooperation to sequence the atlantic salmon genome, which is sequencing a european atlantic salmon, can be transferred to atlantic salmon from north america.
