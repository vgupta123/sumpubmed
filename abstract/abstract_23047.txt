BACKGROUND
the cysteine and glycine rich protein  <dig>  encoded by the csrp <dig> gene is a lim domain protein expressed in the vascular system, particularly in smooth muscle cells. it exhibits a bimodal subcellular distribution, accumulating at actin-based filaments in the cytosol and in the nucleus. in order to analyze the function of crp <dig> in vivo, we disrupted the csrp <dig> gene in mice and analysed the resulting phenotype.


RESULTS
a ~ <dig>  kbp fragment of the murine csrp <dig> gene containing exon  <dig> through  <dig> was isolated. using this construct we confirmed the recently determined chromosomal localization . a gene disruption cassette was cloned into exon  <dig> and a mouse strain lacking functional csrp <dig> was generated. mice lacking crp <dig> are viable and fertile and have no obvious deficits in reproduction and survival. however, detailed histological and electron microscopic studies reveal that crp2-deficient mice have subtle alterations in their cardiac ultrastructure. in these mice, the cardiomyocytes display a slight increase in their thickness, indicating moderate hypertrophy at the cellular level. although the expression of several intercalated disc-associated proteins such as Î²-catenin, n-rap and connexin- <dig> were not affected in these mice, the distribution of respective proteins was changed within heart tissue.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the lack of crp <dig> is associated with alterations in cardiomyocyte thickness and hypertrophy.
