BACKGROUND
infection with parasite protozoa is a long-term health issue in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world. the toll-like receptor  signaling pathway is one of the first-responding defense systems against leishmania. the aim of this study was to investigate the expression of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in jejunum and colon and its correlation with cd11c, cd11b, and cd <dig> receptors used as markers for dendritic cells and macrophages.

methods
twenty four dogs infected with leishmania infantum were used in this study. cytometry was carried out in lamina propria cells from jejunum and colon using markers for tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  cd11b, cd11c and cd <dig> 


RESULTS
cellular inflammatory exudate was diffuse in the mucosa and submucosa, predominately comprising mononuclear cells: plasma cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes. despite the parasite load, microscopy showed no erosion was evident in the epithelial mucosa layers. the colon harbored more parasites than the jejunum. flow cytometry revealed higher frequency of tlr2+ and cd11c+ dendritic cells in the colon than in the jejunum. conversely, tlr9-expressing cells were more frequent in jejunum. moreover, frequency of macrophages  expressing simultaneity tlr <dig> were lower in the colon than in jejunum, while cd11c+ cells predominated in the colon. despite of the negative elisa serum results, il- <dig> and tnf-α were higher in jejunum than colon of infected animals. however, il- <dig> was higher in colon than jejunum of infected animals. a higher expression these cytokines were demonstrated in infected dogs compared to uninfected dogs.


CONCLUSIONS
there was no correlation between clinical signs and pathological changes and immunological and parasitological findings in the gastrointestinal tract in canine visceral leishmaniasis. however, jejunum showed a lower parasite load with increased frequency and expression of cd11b, tlr <dig>  cd14/cd11b/tlr <dig> receptors and il- <dig> and tnf-α cytokines. conversely, the colon showed a higher parasite load along with increased frequency and expression of tlr <dig>  cd11c receptors, and il- <dig> cytokine. thus, leishmania infantum is able to interfere in jejunum increased expression of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  cd11b, cd <dig>  cd14/cd11b/tlr <dig> receptors, il- <dig>  and tnf-α; and in colon increased expression of cd11c, tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  cd11b, cd <dig> e, cd14/cd11b/tlr <dig> receptors, il- <dig>  and tnf-α.
