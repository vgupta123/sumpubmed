BACKGROUND
the inability of current vaccines to provide effective protection against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  infection is not fully understood. one of the reasons might be the presence of anti-idiotypic antibodies  to the envelope glycoprotein gp <dig> induced by prrsv infection since our previous studies demonstrated the presence of auto-ab2s  in pigs infected with prrsv. to test this hypothesis, prrsv negative piglets were injected with a monoclonal ab <dig>  and aab2s that are specific for anti-gp <dig> antibody, vaccinated with the attenuated prrsv vaccine ch-1r and then challenged with the highly pathogenic prrsv hun <dig> strain. the animals were evaluated for clinical signs, pathological changes of the thymus and lungs, viremia, levels of serum antibodies and cytokines.


RESULTS
the piglets injected with mab2-5g <dig> or aab <dig>  and who received the attenuated prrsv vaccine ch-1r before challenge, produced high levels of anti-n antibodies, il- <dig> and il- <dig>  but low levels of neutralizing antibodies. after prrsv hun <dig> challenge, the animals showed obvious clinical signs, including lung lesions, severe thymus atrophy and decreased production of il- <dig> and higher level of viremia.


CONCLUSIONS
when anti-gp <dig> ab2s are present, the use of attenuated prrsv vaccine ch-1r against hp-prrsv infection is not recommended. it can result in poor health status with pneumonia and thymus atrophy.
