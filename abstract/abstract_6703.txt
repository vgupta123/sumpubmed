BACKGROUND
blomia tropicalis is a dust mite and an important source of allergens in tropical regions. up to now, the assays to diagnose atopy to this mite use whole body extract as antigens. however, anti-b. tropicalis ige antibodies cross-react with ascaris lumbricoides antigens, hindering the diagnosis of allergy to this mite. in this study, b. tropicalis recombinant allergens were evaluated with the purpose of developing an immunodiagnostic assay for allergy to this mite with greater specificity than those commercially available.

methods
two b. tropicalis allergens  were cloned into a plasmidial expression vector, expressed in escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. sixty-three sera containing anti-b. tropicalis extract  ige antibodies were used to investigate ige reactivity to the recombinant blot  <dig> and  <dig> allergens. inhibition assays with  <dig> sera pre-adsorbed with a. lumbricoides extract were performed using rblo t  <dig>  rblo t  <dig>  and bte as antigens. all the assays were carried using indirect elisa.


RESULTS
eighty-two point nine percent and  <dig> % of the sera with anti-bte antibodies from  <dig> children reacted with rblo t  <dig> and rblo t  <dig>  respectively, whereas  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the  <dig> sera with anti-bte antibodies from adult asthma patients reacted with the same allergens, and  <dig> % of these sera reacted with a mixture of rblo t  <dig> and rblo t  <dig>  in an inhibition elisa, the absorption of sera by a. lumbricoides extract affected less the reaction with rblo t  <dig> and rblo t  <dig> than with bte.


CONCLUSIONS
the rblo t  <dig> and rblo t  <dig> allergens contain important epitopes recognized by ige antibodies of individuals allergic to b. tropicalis antigens. moreover, the assays using the recombinant allergens had lower ige cross-reactivity with a. lumbricoides antigens, a fact which would confers higher specificity to serodiagnostic assays than the crude mite extract. however, additional recombinant allergens should be evaluated in order to reach the same sensitivity of the commercially available assays based on mite extract.
