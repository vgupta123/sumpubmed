BACKGROUND
in mammals, abcb <dig> constitutes a cellular “first line of defense” against a wide array of chemicals and drugs conferring cellular multidrug or multixenobiotic resistance . we tested the hypothesis that an abcb <dig> ortholog serves as protection for the sensitive developmental processes in zebrafish embryos against adverse compounds dissolved in the water.


RESULTS
indication for abcb1-type efflux counteracting the accumulation of chemicals in zebrafish embryos comes from experiments with fluorescent and toxic transporter substrates and inhibitors. with inhibitors present, levels of fluorescent dyes in embryo tissue and sensitivity of embryos to toxic substrates were generally elevated. we verified two predicted sequences from zebrafish, previously annotated as abcb <dig>  by cloning; our synteny analyses, however, identified them as abcb <dig> and abcb <dig>  respectively. the abcb <dig> gene is absent in the zebrafish genome and we explored whether instead abcb <dig> and/or abcb <dig> show toxicant defense properties. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  analyses showed the presence of transcripts of both genes throughout the first  <dig> hours of zebrafish development. similar to transporter inhibitors, morpholino knock-down of abcb <dig> increased accumulation of fluorescent substrates in embryo tissue and sensitivity of embryos toward toxic compounds. in contrast, morpholino knock-down of abcb <dig> did not exert this effect. atpase assays with recombinant protein obtained with the baculovirus expression system confirmed that dye and toxic compounds act as substrates of zebrafish abcb <dig> and inhibitors block its function. the compounds tested comprised model substrates of human abcb <dig>  namely the fluorescent dyes rhodamine b and calcein-am and the toxic compounds vinblastine, vincristine and doxorubicin; cyclosporin a, psc <dig>  mk <dig> and verapamil were applied as inhibitors. additionally, tests were performed with ecotoxicologically relevant compounds: phenanthrene  and galaxolide and tonalide .


CONCLUSIONS
we show that zebrafish abcb <dig> is a cellular toxicant transporter and provides protection of embryos against toxic chemicals dissolved in the water. zebrafish abcb <dig> thus is functionally similar to mammalian abcb <dig>  but differs from mammalian abcb <dig>  which is not involved in cellular resistance to chemicals but specifically transports phospholipids in the liver. our data have important implications: abcb <dig> could affect bioavailability - and thus toxicologic and pharmacologic potency - of chemicals to zebrafish embryos and inhibition of abcb <dig> therefore causes chemosensitization, that is, enhanced sensitivity of embryos to toxicants. these aspects should be considered in toxicologic and pharmacologic chemical screens with the zebrafish embryo, a major vertebrate model.
