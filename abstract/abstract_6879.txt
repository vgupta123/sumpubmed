BACKGROUND
macromolecular structures are modeled by conformational optimization within experimental and knowledge-based restraints. discrete restraint-based sampling generates high-quality structures within these restraints and facilitates further refinement in a continuous all-atom energy landscape. this approach has been used successfully for protein loop modeling, comparative modeling and electron density fitting in x-ray crystallography.


RESULTS
here we present a software toolkit  which generalizes discrete restraint-based sampling for use in structural biology. modular design and multi-layered architecture enables rappertk to sample conformations of any macromolecule at many levels of detail and within a variety of experimental restraints. performance against a cα-tracing benchmark shows that the efficiency has not suffered despite the overhead required by this flexibility. we demonstrate the toolkit's capabilities by building high-quality β-sheets and by introducing restraint-driven sampling. rna sampling is demonstrated by rebuilding a protein-rna interface. ability to construct arbitrary ligands is used in sampling protein-ligand interfaces within electron density. finally, secondary structure and shape information derived from em are combined to generate multiple conformations of a protein consistent with the observed density.


CONCLUSIONS
through its modular design and ease of use, rappertk enables exploration of a wide variety of interesting avenues in structural biology. this toolkit, with illustrative examples, is freely available to academic users from .
