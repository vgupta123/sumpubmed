BACKGROUND
type iv secretion  systems are involved in secretion of virulence factors such as toxins or transforming molecules, or bacterial conjugation. t4s systems are composed of  <dig> proteins named virb1-b <dig> and vird <dig>  among them, three atpases are involved in the assembly of the t4s system and/or provide energy for substrate transfer, virb <dig>  virb <dig> and vird <dig>  the x-ray crystal structures of virb <dig> and vird <dig> have already been solved but virb <dig> has proven to be reluctant to any structural investigation so far.


RESULTS
here, we have used small-angle x-ray scattering to obtain the first structural models for the membrane-extracted, dimeric form of the trab protein, the virb <dig> homolog encoded by the e. coli pkm <dig> plasmid, and for the monomeric soluble form of the lvhb <dig> protein, the virb <dig> homolog of the t4s system encoded by the legionella pneumophila lvh operon. we have obtained the low resolution structures of the full-length trab and of its n- and c-terminal halves. from these saxs models, we derive the internal organisation of trab. we also show that the two trab n- and c-terminal domains are independently involved in the dimerisation of the full-length protein.


CONCLUSIONS
these models provide the first structural insights into the architecture of virb <dig> proteins. in particular, our results highlight the modular arrangement and functional relevance of the dimeric-membrane-bound form of trab.
