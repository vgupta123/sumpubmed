BACKGROUND
pseudomonas putida kt <dig>  is a highly versatile saprophytic soil bacterium. it is a certified bio-safety host for transferring foreign genes. therefore, the bacterium is used as a model organism for genetic and physiological studies and for the development of biotechnological applications. in order to provide a more systematic application of the organism, we have constructed a protein-protein interaction  network analysis system of p. putida kt <dig> 


RESULTS
putidanet is a comprehensive interaction database and server of p. putida kt <dig> which is generated from three protein-protein interaction  methods. we used psimap , peimap , and domain-domain interactions using ipfam. putidanet contains  <dig>  proteins, and  <dig>  possible interactions consisting of  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   interaction pairs except for self interaction. also, we performed a case study by integrating a protein interaction network and experimental 1-de/ms-ms analysis data p. putida. we found that 1) major functional modules are involved in various metabolic pathways and ribosomes, and 2) existing ppi sub-networks that are specific to succinate or benzoate metabolism are not in the center as predicted.


CONCLUSIONS
we introduce the putidanet which provides predicted interaction partners and functional analyses such as physicochemical properties, kegg pathway assignment, and gene ontology mapping of p. putida kt <dig> putidanet is freely available at http://sequenceome.kobic.kr/putidanet.
