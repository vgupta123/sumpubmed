BACKGROUND
the developing eye receives blood supply from two vascular systems, the intraocular hyaloid system and the superficial choroidal vessels. in zebrafish, a highly stereotypic and simple set of vessels develops on the surface of the eye prior to development of choroidal vessels. the origins and formation of this so-called superficial system have not been described.


RESULTS
we have analyzed the development of superficial vessels by time-lapse imaging and identified their origins by photoconversion experiments in kdrl:kaede transgenic embryos. we show that the entire superficial system is derived from a venous origin, and surprisingly, we find that the hyaloid system has, in addition to its previously described arterial origin, a venous origin for specific vessels. despite arising solely from a vein, one of the vessels in the superficial system, the nasal radial vessel , appears to acquire an arterial identity while growing over the nasal aspect of the eye and this happens in a blood flow-independent manner.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide a thorough analysis of the early development and origins of zebrafish ocular vessels and establish the superficial vasculature as a model for studying vascular patterning in the context of the developing eye.
