BACKGROUND
to enhance capabilities for genomic analyses in rainbow trout, such as genomic selection, a large suite of polymorphic markers that are amenable to high-throughput genotyping protocols must be identified. expressed sequence tags  have been used for single nucleotide polymorphism  discovery in salmonids. in those strategies, the salmonid semi-tetraploid genomes often led to assemblies of paralogous sequences and therefore resulted in a high rate of false positive snp identification. sequencing genomic dna using primers identified from ests proved to be an effective but time consuming methodology of snp identification in rainbow trout, therefore not suitable for high throughput snp discovery. in this study, we employed a high-throughput strategy that used pyrosequencing technology to generate data from a reduced representation library constructed with genomic dna pooled from  <dig> unrelated rainbow trout that represent the national center for cool and cold water aquaculture  broodstock population.


RESULTS
the reduced representation library consisted of  <dig> bp fragments resulting from complete digestion with the restriction enzyme haeiii; sequencing produced  <dig> , <dig> reads providing an average  <dig> fold coverage of the estimated  <dig>  unique genomic restriction fragments . three independent data analyses identified  <dig>  to  <dig>  putative snps on  <dig>  to  <dig>  independent contigs. a set of  <dig> putative snps, randomly selected from the sets produced by the three analyses were genotyped on individual fish to determine the validation rate of putative snps among analyses, distinguish apparent snps that actually represent paralogous loci in the tetraploid genome, examine mendelian segregation, and place the validated snps on the rainbow trout linkage map. approximately 48%  of the putative snps were validated;  <dig> markers were successfully incorporated into the rainbow trout linkage map. in addition, 2% of the sequences from the validated markers were associated with rainbow trout transcripts.


CONCLUSIONS
the use of reduced representation libraries and pyrosequencing technology proved to be an effective strategy for the discovery of a high number of putative snps in rainbow trout; however, modifications to the technique to decrease the false discovery rate resulting from the evolutionary recent genome duplication would be desirable.
