BACKGROUND
retention of sister centromere cohesion during meiosis i and its dissolution at meiosis ii is necessary for balanced chromosome segregation and reduction of chromosome number. patronus <dig>  has recently been proposed to regulate centromere cohesion in arabidopsis after meiosis i, during interkinesis. pans <dig> mutants lose centromere cohesion prematurely during interkinesis and segregate randomly at meiosis ii. pans <dig> protein interacts with components of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome .


RESULTS
we show here that pans <dig> protein is found mainly in prophase i of meiosis, with its level declining late in prophase i during diplotene. pans <dig> also shows expression in dividing tissues. we demonstrate that, in addition to the previously reported premature loss of centromere cohesion during interkinesis, pans <dig> mutants show partially penetrant defects in centromere cohesion during meiosis i. we also determine that pans <dig> shows synthetic lethality at the level of the sporophyte, with omission of second division  <dig> , which encodes a known inhibitor of the apc/c that is required for cell cycle progression during mitosis, as well as meiosis i and ii.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that pans <dig> is expressed mainly in meiosis i where it has an important function and together with previous studies indicate that pans <dig> and osd <dig> are part of a network linking centromere cohesion and cell cycle progression through control of apc/c activity.
