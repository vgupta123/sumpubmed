BACKGROUND
protamines are sperm nuclear proteins with a crucial role in chromatin condensation. their function is strongly linked to sperm head morphology and male fertility. protamines appear to be affected by a complex pattern of selective constraints. previous studies showed that sexual selection affects protamine coding sequence and expression in rodents. here we analyze selective constraints and post-copulatory sexual selection acting on protamine  <dig>  gene sequences of  <dig> species of primates and rodents. we focused on possible differences in selective constraints between these two clades and on the two functional domains of prm <dig> . we also assessed if and how changes in prm <dig> coding sequence may affect sperm head dimensions.


RESULTS
the domain of prm <dig> that is cleaved off during binding to dna  was found to be under purifying selection in both clades, whereas the domain that remains bound to dna  was found to be positively selected in primates and under relaxed constraint in rodents. changes in cleaved-prm <dig> coding sequence are significantly correlated to sperm head width and elongation in rodents. contrary to expectations, a significant effect of sexual selection was not found on either domain or clade.


CONCLUSIONS
mature-prm <dig> may be free to evolve under less constraint due to the existence of prm <dig> as a more conserved and functionally redundant copy. the cleaved-prm <dig> domain seems to play an important role in sperm head shaping. however, sexual selection on its sequence may be difficult to detect until it is identified which sperm head phenotype  confers advantages for sperm performance in different mammalian clades.
