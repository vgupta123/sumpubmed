BACKGROUND
celf/bruno-like proteins play multiple roles, including the regulation of alternative splicing and translation. these rna-binding proteins contain two rna recognition motif  domains at the n-terminus and another rrm at the c-terminus. cugbp <dig> is a member of this family of proteins that possesses several alternatively spliced exons.


RESULTS
the present study investigated the expression of exon  <dig>  which is an alternatively spliced exon and encodes the first half of the third rrm of cugbp <dig>  the ratio of exon  <dig> skipping product  to its inclusion was reduced in neuronal cells induced from p <dig> cells and in the brain. although full length cugbp <dig> and the cugbp <dig> r3δ isoforms showed a similar effect on the inclusion of the smooth muscle  exon of the actn <dig> gene, these isoforms showed an opposite effect on the skipping of exon  <dig> in the insulin receptor gene. in addition, examination of structural changes in these isoforms by molecular dynamics simulation and nmr spectrometry suggested that the third rrm of r3δ isoform was flexible and did not form an rrm structure.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that cugbp <dig> regulates the splicing of actn <dig> and insulin receptor by different mechanisms. alternative splicing of cugbp <dig> exon  <dig> contributes to the regulation of the splicing of the insulin receptor. the present findings specifically show how alternative splicing events that result in three-dimensional structural changes in cugbp <dig> can lead to changes in its biological activity.
