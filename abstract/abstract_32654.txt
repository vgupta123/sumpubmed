BACKGROUND
hypopharyngeal glands  of honeybee workers play an important role in honeybee nutrition and caste differentiation. previous research mainly focused on age-dependent morphological, physiological, biochemical and genomic characters of the hg. here proteomics and biochemical network analysis were used to follow protein changes during the hg development.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> proteins were unambiguously identified on day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. these proteins were major royal jelly proteins , metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins, cytoskeleton, development regulation, antioxidant, molecule transporter, regulation of transcription/translation, proteins with folding functions. the most interesting is that mrjp's that have been detected in the hg of the newly emerged worker bees. the mrjp's expression is at peak level from 6- <dig> days, was validated by western blot analysis of mrjp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  moreover,  <dig> key node proteins were found in the biochemical networks of the hg.


CONCLUSIONS
hg secretes rj at peak level within 6- <dig> days, but the worker bee can secrete royal jelly  since birth, which is a new finding. several key node proteins play an important role in the biochemical networks of the developing hg. this provides us some target proteins when genetically manipulating honeybees.
