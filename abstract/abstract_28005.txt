BACKGROUND
adhesion of mycoplasma pneumoniae  to host epithelial cells requires several adhesin proteins like p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  among these proteins, p <dig> protein has been inedited as one of the major adhesin and immunogenic protein present on the attachment organelle of m. pneumoniae. in the present study, we scanned the entire sequence of m. pneumoniae p <dig> protein to identify the immunodominant and cytadherence region. m. pneumoniae p <dig> gene was synthesized in four segments replacing all the uga codons to ugg codons. each of the four purified p <dig> protein fragment was analyzed for its immunogenicity with anti-m. pneumoniae m <dig> antibodies  and sera of m. pneumoniae infected patients by western blotting and elisa. antibodies were produced against all the p <dig> protein fragments and these antibodies were used for m. pneumoniae adhesion, m. pneumoniae adhesion inhibition and m. pneumoniae surface exposure assays using hep- <dig> cells lines.


RESULTS
our results show that the immunodominant regions are distributed throughout the entire length of p <dig> protein, while only the n- and c- terminal region of p <dig> protein are surface exposed and block cytadhesion to hep- <dig> cells, while antibodies to two middle fragments failed to block cytadhesion.


CONCLUSIONS
these results have important implications in designing strategies to block the attachment of m. pneumoniae to epithelial cells, thus preventing the development of atypical pneumonia.
