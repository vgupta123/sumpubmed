BACKGROUND
nitroglycerin can induce relaxation of swine carotid artery without sustained reductions in i or myosin regulatory light chain  phosphorylation. this has been termed force suppression and been found to correlate with ser16-phosphorylation of heat shock protein  <dig> . we tested for the existence of this mechanism in a smooth muscle that is not responsive to nitric oxide.

methods
isometrically mounted mucosa free rabbit bladder strips were contracted with carbachol and relaxed with 8-br-cgmp, forskolin, or isoprenaline.


RESULTS
contraction was associated with a highly cooperative relation between mrlc phosphorylation and force such that very small increases in mrlc phosphorylation induced large increases in force. relaxation induced by 8-br-cgmp, forskolin, or isoprenaline did not shift the mrlc phosphorylation-force relation from that observed with carbachol alone, i.e. there was no force suppression. hsp <dig> content was negligible .


CONCLUSIONS
the lack of force suppression in the absence of hsp <dig> is consistent with the hypothesized role for hsp <dig> in the force suppression observed in tonic smooth muscles.
