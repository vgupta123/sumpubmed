BACKGROUND
calorie restriction  produces a number of health benefits and ameliorates diseases of aging such as type  <dig> diabetes. the components of the pathways downstream of cr may provide intervention points for developing therapeutics for treating diseases of aging. the nad+-dependent protein deacetylase sirt <dig> has been implicated as one of the key downstream regulators of cr in yeast, rodents, and humans. small molecule activators of sirt <dig> have been identified that exhibit efficacy in animal models of diseases typically associated with aging including type  <dig> diabetes. to identify molecular processes induced in the liver of mice treated with two structurally distinct sirt <dig> activators, sirt <dig>  and srt <dig>  for three days, we utilized a systems biology approach and applied causal network modeling  on gene expression data to elucidate downstream effects of sirt <dig> activation.


RESULTS
here we demonstrate that sirt <dig> activators recapitulate many of the molecular events downstream of cr in vivo, such as enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis, improving metabolic signaling pathways, and blunting pro-inflammatory pathways in mice fed a high fat, high calorie diet.


CONCLUSIONS
cnm of gene expression data from mice treated with srt <dig> or srt <dig> in combination with supporting in vitro and in vivo data demonstrates that srt <dig> and srt <dig> produce a signaling profile that mirrors cr, improves glucose and insulin homeostasis, and acts via sirt <dig> activation in vivo. taken together these results are encouraging regarding the use of small molecule activators of sirt <dig> for therapeutic intervention into type  <dig> diabetes, a strategy which is currently being investigated in multiple clinical trials.
