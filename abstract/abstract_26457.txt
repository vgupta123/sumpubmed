BACKGROUND
dyt <dig> dystonia is an autosomal dominant neurological condition caused by a mutation that removes a single glutamic acid residue  from the torsina  aaa+ protein. tora appears to possess a nuclear envelope  localized activity that requires lamina-associated-polypeptide  <dig> , which is an inner nuclear membrane localized tora-binding partner. although hypoactive, the dyt <dig> dystonia tora-Δe isoform often concentrates in the ne, suggesting that tora-Δe also interacts with an ne-localized binding partner.


RESULTS
we confirm that ne-localized tora-Δe does not co-immunoprecipitate with lap <dig>  and find that tora-Δe continues to concentrate in the ne of cells that lack lap <dig>  instead, we find that variability in tora-Δe localization correlates with the presence of the sun-domain and nesprin proteins that assemble into the linc complex. we also find that sirna depletion of sun <dig>  but not other linc complex components, removes tora-Δe from the ne. in contrast, the lap1-dependent ne-accumulation of an atp-locked tora mutant is unaffected by loss of linc complex proteins. this sun <dig> dependent tora-Δe localization requires the tora membrane association domain, as well as a putative substrate-interaction residue, y <dig>  neither of which are required for tora interaction with lap <dig>  we also find that mutation of these motifs, or depletion of sun <dig>  decreases the amount of tora-wt that colocalizes with ne markers, indicating that each also underlies a normal ne-localized tora binding interaction.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that the disease causing Δe mutation promotes an association between tora and sun <dig> that is distinct to the interaction between lap <dig> and atp-bound tora. this evidence for two ne-localized binding partners suggests that tora may act on multiple substrates and/or possesses regulatory co-factor partners. in addition, finding that the dyt <dig> mutation causes abnormal association with sun <dig> implicates linc complex dysfunction in dyt <dig> dystonia pathogenesis, and suggests a gain-of-function activity contributes to this dominantly inherited disease.
