BACKGROUND
recently, the discovery of copy number variation  led researchers to think that there are more variations of genomic dna than initially believed. moreover, a certain cnv region has been found to be associated with the onset of diseases. therefore, cnv is now known as an important genomic variation in biological mechanisms. however, most cnv studies have only involved the human genome. the study of cnv involving other animals, including cattle, is severely lacking.


RESULTS
in our study of cattle, we used illumina bovinesnp <dig> beadchip  to obtain each marker's signal intensity  and allelic intensity , which led to our discovery of  <dig> bovine cnvs from  <dig> cows. for these animals, the average number of cnvs was  <dig> , average size was  <dig>  kb, and median size was  <dig>  kb. taking into consideration some overlapping regions among the identified bovine cnvs,  <dig> unique cnv regions were detected. among them, there were  <dig> common cnvrs with > 1% cnv frequency. together, these cnvrs contained  <dig> genes. heritability errors of  <dig> bovine pedigrees and comparative pairwise analyses were analyzed to detect  <dig> common deletion polymorphisms. identified variations in this study were successfully validated using visual examination of the genoplot image, mendelian inconsistency, another cnv identification program, and quantitative pcr.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we describe a map of bovine cnvs and provide important resources for future bovine genome research. this result will contribute to animal breeding and protection from diseases with the aid of genomic information.
