BACKGROUND
gene duplication supplies the raw materials for novel gene functions and many gene families arisen from duplication experience adaptive evolution. most studies of young duplicates have focused on mammals, especially humans, whereas reports describing their genome-wide evolutionary patterns across the closely related drosophila species are rare. the sequenced  <dig> drosophila genomes provide the opportunity to address this issue.


RESULTS
in our study,  <dig>  young duplicate gene families were identified across the  <dig> drosophila species and three types of expansions, species-specific, lineage-specific and complex expansions, were detected in these gene families. our data showed that the species-specific young duplicate genes predominated  over the other two types. interestingly, many independent species-specific expansions in the same gene family have been observed in many species, even including  <dig> or  <dig> drosophila species. our data also showed that the functional bias observed in these young duplicate genes was mainly related to responses to environmental stimuli and biotic stresses.


CONCLUSIONS
this study reveals the evolutionary patterns of young duplicates across  <dig> drosophila species on a genomic scale. our results suggest that convergent evolution acts on young duplicate genes after the species differentiation and adaptive evolution may play an important role in duplicate genes for adaption to ecological factors and environmental changes in drosophila.
