BACKGROUND
the cancer genome atlas  is a comprehensive database that includes multi-layered cancer genome profiles. large-scale collection of data inevitably generates batch effects introduced by differences in processing at various stages from sample collection to data generation. however, batch effects on the sequence variation and its characteristics have not been studied extensively.


RESULTS
we systematically evaluated batch effects on somatic sequence variations in pan-cancer tcga data, revealing  <dig> somatic variants that were batch-biased with statistical significance . most of the batch-biased variants were associated with specific sample plates. the batch-biased variants, which had a unique mutational spectrum with frequent indel-type mutations, preferentially occurred at sites prone to sequencing errors, e.g., in long homopolymer runs. non-indel type batch-biased variants were frequent at splicing sites with the unique consensus motif sequence ‘ttdtttagtt’. furthermore, some batch-biased variants occur in known cancer genes, potentially causing misinterpretation of mutation profiles.


CONCLUSIONS
our strategy for identifying batch-biased variants and characterising sequence patterns might be useful in eliminating false variants and facilitating correct interpretation of sequence profiles.
