BACKGROUND
severe acute respiratory syndrome  is a severe respiratory illness caused by a novel virus, the sars coronavirus . 3c-like protease  of sars-cov plays a role in processing viral polypeptide precursors and is responsible of viral maturation. however, the function of 3clpro in host cells remains unknown. this study investigated how the 3clpro affected the secretion of cytokines in the gene-transfected cells.


RESULTS
from immunofluorescence microscopy, the localization of c-myc tagged 3clpro was detected both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected a <dig> cells. expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor  was significantly decreased in 3clpro-transfected cells by both rt-pcr and elisa, but without changes in other cytokines, i.e., il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il12p <dig>  tnf-α, and tgf-β. furthermore, the protein levels of nf-kb decreased in 3clpro-transfected a <dig> cells when compared to egfp transfected cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that the 3clpro may suppress expression of gm-csf in transfected a <dig> cells through down-regulation of nf-kb production.
