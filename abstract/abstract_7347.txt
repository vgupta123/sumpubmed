BACKGROUND
previous studies have proposed that mammalian toll like receptors  have evolved under diversifying selection due to their role in pathogen detection. to determine if this is the case, we examined the extent of adaptive evolution in the tlr <dig> gene in both individual species and defined clades of the mammalia.


RESULTS
in support of previous studies, we find evidence of adaptive evolution of mammalian tlr <dig>  however, we also show that tlr <dig> genes of domestic livestock have a concentration of single nucleotide polymorphisms suggesting a specific signature of adaptation. using codon models of evolution we have identified a concentration of rapidly evolving codons within the tlr <dig> extracellular domain a site of interaction between host and the bacterial surface protein flagellin.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that interactions between pathogen and host may be driving adaptive change in tlr <dig> by competition between species. in support of this, we have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms  in sheep and cattle tlr <dig> genes that are co-localised and co-incident with the predicted adaptive codons suggesting that adaptation in this region of the tlr <dig> gene is on-going in domestic species.
