BACKGROUND
brassica rapa includes several important leaf vegetable crops whose production is often damaged by high temperature. cis-natural antisense transcripts  and cis-nats-derived small interfering rnas  play important roles in plant development and stress responses. however, genome-wide cis-nats in b. rapa are not known. the nats and nat-sirnas that respond to heat stress have never been well studied in b. rapa. here, we took advantage of rna-seq and small rna  deep sequencing technology to identify cis-nats and heat responsive nat-sirnas in b. rapa.


RESULTS
analyses of four rna sequencing datasets revealed  <dig> cis-nats b. rapa ssp. chinensis cv wut and b. rapa ssp. pekinensis cv. bre. based on sequence homology between arabidopsis thaliana and b. rapa,  <dig> conserved cis-nats in b. rapa were found to correspond to  <dig> cis-nats in arabidopsis; the remaining  <dig> novel cis-nats were identified as brassica-specific ones. using six srna libraries,  <dig> nat-sirnas derived from  <dig> cis-nats were detected. differential expression analysis revealed that nat-sirnas derived from  <dig> cis-nats were responsive to heat stress, and most of them showed strand bias. real-time pcr indicated that most of the transcripts generating heat-responsive nat-sirnas were upregulated under heat stress, while the transcripts from the opposite strands of the same loci were downregulated.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide the first subsets of genome-wide cis-nats and heat-responsive nat-sirnas in b. rapa; these srnas are potentially useful for the genetic improvement of heat tolerance in b. rapa and other crops.
