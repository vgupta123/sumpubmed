BACKGROUND
inhibition of intestinal peristalsis is a major side effect of opioid analgesics. although tramadol is an opioid-like analgesic, its effect on gut motility is little known. therefore, the effect of -tramadol, -tramadol and the major metabolite o-desmethyltramadol on intestinal peristalsis in vitro and their mechanisms of action were examined. distension-induced peristalsis was recorded in fluid-perfused segments of the guinea pig small intestine. the intraluminal peristaltic pressure threshold  was used to quantify the motor effects of extraserosally administered drugs.


RESULTS
racemic tramadol, its - and -enantiomers and the major metabolite o-desmethyltramadol  concentration-dependently increased ppt until peristalsis was transiently or persistently abolished. the rank order of potency was -tramadol < -tramadol <o-desmethyltramadol. the peristaltic motor inhibition caused by - and -tramadol was markedly and that of o-desmethyltramadol nearly completely prevented by naloxone, but left unaltered by the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonists methysergide plus tropisetron. the adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin plus yohimbine reduced the effect of - and -tramadol but not that of o-desmethyltramadol.


CONCLUSIONS
the results show that the metabolite o-desmethyltramadol is more potent in inhibiting peristalsis than its parent compound. the action of all tramadol forms depends on opioid receptors, and that of - and -tramadol also involves adrenoceptors.
