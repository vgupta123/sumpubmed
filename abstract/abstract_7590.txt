BACKGROUND
various histone acetylases  play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression, but the precise functions of many of those hats are still unknown. here we provide evidence that myst <dig>  a known hat, may be involved in early mammalian gametogenesis.


RESULTS
although myst <dig> mrna transcripts are ubiquitous, protein expression was restricted to select extracts . immunohistochemistry experiments performed on ovary sections revealed that the myst <dig> protein is confined to oocytes, granulosa and theca cells, as well as to cells composing the blood vessels. the transcripts for myst <dig> and all-myst4-isoforms were present in oocytes and in in vitro produced embryos. in oocytes and embryos the myst <dig> protein was localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. within testis sections, the myst <dig> protein was specific to only one cell type, the elongating spermatids, where it was exclusively nuclear.


CONCLUSIONS
we established that myst <dig> is localized into specialized cells of the ovary and testis. because the majority of these cells are involved in male and female gametogenesis, myst <dig> may contribute to important and specific acetylation events occurring during gametes and embryo development.
