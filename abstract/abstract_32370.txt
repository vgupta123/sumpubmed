BACKGROUND
the xklp <dig>  proteins belong to the microtubule-associated  family of proteins. all members of the family contain the conserved tpx <dig> motif, which can interact with microtubules, regulate microtubule dynamics or assist with different microtubule functions, for example, maintenance of cell morphology or regulation of cell growth and development. however, the role of members of the tpx family have not been studied in the model tree species eucalyptus to date. here, we report the identification of the members of the tpx <dig> family in eucalyptus grandis  and analyse the expression patterns and functions of these genes.


RESULTS
in present study, a comprehensive analysis of the plant tpx <dig> family proteins was performed. phylogenetic analyses indicated that the genes can be classified into  <dig> distinct subfamilies. a genome-wide survey identified  <dig> members of the tpx <dig> family in the sequenced genome of eucalyptus grandis. the basic genetic properties of the tpx <dig> family in eucalyptus were analysed. our results suggest that the tpx <dig> family proteins within different sub-groups are relatively conserved but there are important differences between groups. quantitative real-time pcr  was performed to confirm the expression levels of the genes in different tissues. the results showed that in the whole plant, the levels of egwdl <dig> transcript are the highest, followed by those of egwdl <dig>  compared with other tissues, the level of the egmap <dig> transcript is the highest in the root. over-expression of egmap <dig> in arabidopsis resulted in organ twisting. the cotyledon petioles showed left-handed twisting while the hypocotyl epidermal cells produced right-handed helical twisting. finally, egmap <dig>  egwdl <dig> and egwdl3l were all able to decorate microtubules.


CONCLUSIONS
plant tpx <dig> family proteins were systematically analysed using bioinformatics methods. there are  <dig> tpx <dig> family proteins in eucalyptus. we have performed an initial characterization of the functions of several members of the tpx <dig> family. we found that the gene products are localized to the microtubule cytoskeleton. our results lay the foundation for future efforts to reveal the biological significance of tpx <dig> family proteins in eucalyptus.
