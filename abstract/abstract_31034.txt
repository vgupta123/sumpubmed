BACKGROUND
myc proteins are essential regulators of animal growth during normal development, and their deregulation is one of the main driving factors of human malignancies. they function as transcription factors that  control many growth- and proliferation-associated genes, and in some contexts contribute to global gene regulation.


RESULTS
we combine chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing  and rnaseq approaches in drosophila tissue culture cells to identify a core set of less than  <dig> myc target genes, whose salient function resides in the control of ribosome biogenesis. among these genes we find the non-coding snorna genes as a large novel class of myc targets. all assayed snornas are affected by myc, and many of them are subject to direct transcriptional activation by myc, both in drosophila and in vertebrates. the loss of snornas impairs growth during normal development, whereas their overexpression increases tumor mass in a model for neuronal tumors.


CONCLUSIONS
this work shows that myc acts as a master regulator of snornp biogenesis. in addition, in combination with recent observations of snorna involvement in human cancer, it raises the possibility that myc’s transforming effects are partially mediated by this class of non-coding transcripts.
