BACKGROUND
pyruvate kinase  catalyzes the generation of pyruvate and atp in glycolysis and functions as a key switch in the regulation of carbon flux distribution. both the substrates and products of pyk are involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, anaplerosis and energy anabolism, which places pyk at a primary metabolic intersection. pyks are highly conserved in most bacteria and lower eukaryotes. corynebacterium glutamicum is an industrial workhorse for the production of various amino acids and organic acids. although c. glutamicum was assumed to possess only one pyk , ncgl <dig> was annotated as a pyruvate kinase with an unknown role.


RESULTS
here, we identified that ncgl <dig> was a novel pyruvate kinase  in c. glutamicum. complementation of the wtΔpyk1Δpyk <dig> strain with the pyk <dig> gene restored its growth on d-ribose, which demonstrated that pyk <dig> could substitute for pyk <dig> in vivo. pyk <dig> was co-dependent on mn2+ and k+ and had a higher affinity for adp than phosphoenolpyruvate . the catalytic activity of pyk <dig> was allosterically regulated by fructose  <dig> -bisphosphate  activation and atp inhibition. furthermore, pyk <dig> and ldha, which encodes l-lactate dehydrogenase, were co-transcribed as a bicistronic mrna under aerobic conditions and pyk <dig> deficiency had a slight effect on the intracellular activity of pyk. however, the mrna level of pyk <dig> in the wild-type strain under oxygen deprivation was  <dig> -fold higher than that under aerobic conditions. under oxygen deprivation, pyk <dig> or pyk <dig> deficiency decreased the generation of lactic acid, and the overexpression of either pyk <dig> or pyk <dig> increased the production of lactic acid as the activity of pyk increased. fed-batch fermentation of the pyk2-overexpressing wtΔpyk <dig> strain produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l of lactic acid, which was a 47% increase compared to the parent strain under oxygen deprivation.


CONCLUSIONS
pyk <dig> functioned as a pyruvate kinase and contributed to the increased level of pyk activity under oxygen deprivation.
