BACKGROUND
salmonella typhimurium st <dig> was first detected in the mexican typhimurium population in  <dig>  it is associated with a multi-drug resistance phenotype and a plasmid-borne blacmy- <dig> gene conferring resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. the objective of the current study was to examine the association between the st <dig> genotype and blacmy- <dig> plasmids.


RESULTS
the blacmy- <dig> gene was carried by an inca/c plasmid. st <dig> strains lacking the blacmy- <dig> gene carried a different inca/c plasmid. pcr analysis of seven dna regions distributed throughout the plasmids showed that these inca/c plasmids were related, but the presence and absence of dna stretches produced two divergent types i and ii. a class  <dig> integron  was detected in most of the type i plasmids. type i contained all the plasmids carrying the blacmy- <dig> gene and a subset of plasmids lacking blacmy- <dig>  type ii included all of the remaining blacmy-2-negative plasmids. a sequence comparison of the seven dna regions showed that both types were closely related to inca/c plasmids found in escherichia, salmonella, yersinia, photobacterium, vibrio and aeromonas. analysis of our typhimurium strains showed that the region containing the blacmy- <dig> gene is inserted between traa and trac as a single copy, like in the e. coli plasmid par <dig>  the flor allele was identical to that of newport psn <dig>  suggesting a mosaic pattern of ancestry with plasmids from other salmonella serovars and e. coli. only one of the tested strains was able to conjugate the inca/c plasmid at very low frequencies . the lack of conjugation ability of our inca/c plasmids agrees with the clonal dissemination trend suggested by the chromosomal backgrounds and plasmid pattern associations.


CONCLUSIONS
the ecological success of the newly emerging typhimurium st <dig> genotype in mexico may be related to the carriage of inca/c plasmids. we conclude that types i and ii of inca/c plasmids originated from a common ancestor and that the insertion and deletion of dna stretches have shaped their evolutionary histories.
