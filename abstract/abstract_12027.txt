BACKGROUND
treatment for horses with pythiosis of a limb is challenging. this study aims to evaluate the effects of administering amphotericin b in a 10 % solution of dimethylsulfoxide by intravenous regional limb perfusion  to treat horses for cutaneous pythiosis of a limb.


RESULTS
all  <dig> of the horses treated had complete resolutions of their lesion between  <dig> to  <dig> weeks after a single irlp treatment. no complications were observed at the site of venipuncture for irlp. before initiation of treatment, there was anemia and marked leucocytosis which resolved following treatment. serum biochemistry showed no significant changes.


CONCLUSIONS
irlp administration of amphotericin b in a 10 % dmso solution was easily performed, relatively inexpensive and an effective treatment for treating horses for pythiosis of a limb and resolved the infection with no complications.
