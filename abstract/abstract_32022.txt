BACKGROUND
drp <dig> is the primary protein responsible for mitochondrial fission. perturbations of mitochondrial morphology and increased fission are seen in neurodegeneration. while drp <dig> degradation induced by parkin overexpression can be prevented by proteasome inhibition, there are numerous links between proteasomal and autophagic processes in mitochondrial protein degradation. here we investigated the role of autophagy in drp <dig> regulation.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that autophagy plays a major role in the control of drp <dig> levels. in hek-293t cells, inhibitors of autophagy increase total drp <dig> and levels of drp <dig> in the mitochondrial cellular fraction. similarly by silencing atg <dig>  which is required for initiation of autophagy, there is an increased level of drp <dig>  because of the role of increased drp <dig> in neurodegeneration, we then examined the ability to modulate drp <dig> levels in neurons by inducing autophagy. we are able to decrease drp <dig> levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner with the potent neuronal autophagy inducer 10-ncp, as well as structurally related compounds. further, 10-ncp was able increase average mitochondrial size and length verifying a functional result of drp <dig> depletion in these neurons.


CONCLUSIONS
these pharmacological and genetic approaches indicate that autophagy targets drp <dig> for lysosomal degradation. additionally these data suggest a mechanism, through drp <dig> downregulation, which may partly explain the ability of autophagy to have a neuroprotective effect.
