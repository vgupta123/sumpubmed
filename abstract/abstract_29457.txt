BACKGROUND
the transcription factor atmybr <dig>  is a member of the myb family of transcription factors and is expressed throughout the plant life cycle and especially in senescing and wounded leaves. it has previously been shown to be involved in responses to abiotic stress and is regulated by phosphorylation.


RESULTS
when mybr <dig> was over-expressed under the control of the constitutive 35s promoter in arabidopsis thaliana , leaf senescence was delayed. in contrast loss-of-function mybr <dig> plants showed more rapid chlorophyll loss and senescence. the mybr <dig> promoter strongly drove Î²-glucuronidase reporter gene expression in tissues immediately after wounding and many wounding/pathogenesis genes were downregulated in oxmybr <dig>  oxmybr <dig> plants were more susceptible to injury under water stress than wildtype, which was correlated with suppression of many aba inducible stress genes in oxmybr <dig>  conversely, mybr <dig> plants were more tolerant of water stress and exhibited reduced rates of water loss from leaves. mybr <dig> physically interacted with aba receptor pyr1-like <dig>  suggesting a direct involvement of mybr <dig> in early aba signaling. mybr <dig> appears to exhibit partially redundant functions with atmybr <dig>  and double mybr <dig> x mybr <dig> mutants exhibited stronger senescence and stress related phenotypes than single mybr <dig> and mybr <dig> mutants.


CONCLUSIONS
mybr <dig> is a negative regulator of aba, stress, wounding responses and blocks senescence. it appears to have a homeostatic function to maintain growth processes in the event of physical damage or stress.
