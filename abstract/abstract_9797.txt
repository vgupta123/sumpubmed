BACKGROUND
the limited within-breed genetic heterogeneity and an enrichment of disease-predisposing alleles have made the dog a very suitable model for the identification of genes associated with risk for specific diseases. canine mammary cancer is an example of such a disease. however, the underlying inherited risk factors for canine mammary tumours  are still largely unknown. in this study,  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  in ten human cancer-associated genes were genotyped in two different datasets in order to identify genes/alleles associated with the development of cmts. the first dataset consisted of english springer spaniel  cmt cases and controls. ess is a dog breed known to be at increased risk of developing cmts. in the second dataset, dogs from breeds known to have a high frequency of cmts were compared to dogs from breeds with a lower occurrence of these tumours.


RESULTS
we found significant associations to cmt for snps and haplotypes in the estrogen receptor  <dig>  gene in the ess material . a large number of snps, among them several snps in esr <dig>  showed significantly different allele frequencies between the high and low risk breed groups .


CONCLUSIONS
the identification of cmt-associated snps in esr <dig> in two independent datasets suggests that this gene might be involved in cmt development. these findings also support that cmt may serve as a good model for human breast cancer research.
