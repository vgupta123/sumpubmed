BACKGROUND
given the lack of a complete and comprehensive library of microbial reference genomes, determining the functional profile of diverse microbial communities is challenging. the available functional analysis pipelines lack several key features:  an integrated alignment tool,  operon-level analysis, and  the ability to process large datasets.


RESULTS
here we introduce our open-sourced, stand-alone functional analysis pipeline for analyzing whole metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing data, fmap . fmap performs alignment, gene family abundance calculations, and statistical analysis . the resulting output can be easily visualized with heatmaps and functional pathway diagrams. fmap functional predictions are consistent with currently available functional analysis pipelines.


CONCLUSIONS
fmap is a comprehensive tool for providing functional analysis of metagenomic/metatranscriptomic sequencing data. with the added features of integrated alignment, operon-level analysis, and the ability to process large datasets, fmap will be a valuable addition to the currently available functional analysis toolbox. we believe that this software will be of great value to the wider biology and bioinformatics communities.
