BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori is the causative agent for gastritis, and peptic and duodenal ulcers. the bacterium displays 5- <dig> polar sheathed flagella that are essential for colonisation and persistence in the gastric mucosa. the biochemistry and genetics of flagellar biogenesis in h. pylori has not been fully elucidated. bioinformatics analysis suggested that the gene hp <dig>  annotated as hypothetical, was a flij homologue. in salmonella, flij is a chaperone escort protein for flgn and flit, two proteins that themselves display chaperone activity for components of the hook, the rod and the filament.


RESULTS
ablation of the hp <dig> gene in h. pylori significantly reduced motility. however, flagellin and hook protein synthesis was not affected in the hp <dig> mutant. transmission electron transmission microscopy revealed that the hp <dig> mutant cells displayed a normal flagellum configuration, suggesting that hp <dig> was not essential for assembly and polar localisation of the flagella in the cell. interestingly, whole genome microarrays of an hp <dig> mutant revealed transcriptional changes in a number of genes associated with the flagellar regulon and the cell envelope, such as outer membrane proteins and adhesins. consistent with the array data, lack of the hp <dig> gene significantly reduced adhesion and the inflammatory response in host cells.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that hp <dig> is not a functional counterpart of flij in h. pylori. however, it is required for full motility and it is involved, possibly indirectly, in expression of outer membrane proteins and adhesins involved in pathogenesis and adhesion.
