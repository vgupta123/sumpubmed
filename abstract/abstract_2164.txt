BACKGROUND
evidence suggests that rheumatoid arthritis  may enhance or reduce the progression of alzheimer's disease . the present study was performed to directly explore the effects of collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis  on amyloid plaque formation, microglial activation, and microvascular pathology in the cortex and hippocampus of the double transgenic app/ps <dig> mouse model for ad. wild-type or app/ps <dig> mice that received type ii collagen  in complete freund's adjuvant  at  <dig> months of age revealed characteristics of ra, such as joint swelling, synovitis, and cartilage and bone degradation  <dig> months later. joint pathology was accompanied by sustained induction of il-1β and tnf-α in plasma over  <dig> weeks after administration of cii in cfa.


RESULTS
cia reduced levels of soluble and insoluble amyloid beta  peptides and amyloid plaque formation in the cortex and hippocampus of app/ps <dig> mice, which correlated with increased blood brain barrier disruption, iba-1-positive microglia, and cd45-positive microglia/macrophages. in contrast, cia reduced vessel density and length with features of microvascular pathology, including vascular segments, thinner vessels, and atrophic string vessels.


CONCLUSIONS
the present findings suggest that ra may exert beneficial effects against aβ burden and harmful effects on microvascular pathology in ad.
