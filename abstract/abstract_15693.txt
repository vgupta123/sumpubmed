BACKGROUND
protease-activated receptors  are seven transmembrane g-coupled receptors comprising four genes . mast cell has been identified to be able to express pars and release an array of cytokines upon activation. recently, it was reported that interleukin - <dig> could regulate the expression of pars in mast cells, and tryptase could induce il- <dig> and il- <dig> release from mast cells. in order to further investigate the issues, rna interference  technique was employed and small interfering rnas  of pars were transfected in p <dig> cells.


RESULTS
the results showed that sirnas for par- <dig>  par- <dig> and par- <dig> significantly downregulated expression of par- <dig>  par- <dig> and par- <dig> mrnas and proteins in p <dig> cells at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h following transfection. sirna par- <dig>  and sirna par- <dig>  significantly reduced il- <dig> induced upregulation of par- <dig> and par- <dig> expression, respectively when p <dig> cells were transfected with them for  <dig> h. sirna par- <dig>  blocked il- <dig> induced downregulation of par- <dig> expression on both mrna and protein levels. it was also observed that sirna par- <dig>  and sirna par- <dig>  reduced trypsin induced il- <dig> release by approximately  <dig> % and  <dig> %, and sligkv-nh <dig> induced il- <dig> release by  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. similarly, sirna par- <dig>  eliminated tryptase-induced il- <dig> release by  <dig> %, and sirna par- <dig>  diminished sfllr-nh <dig> induced il- <dig> release by  <dig> %. however, sirna par- <dig> , sirna par- <dig>  and sirna par- <dig>  at  <dig> nm did not show any effect on tryptase-induced il- <dig> release from p <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, sirnas of pars can modulate par expression and par related cytokine production in mast cells, confirming that pars are likely to play a role in allergic reactions.
