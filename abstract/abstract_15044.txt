BACKGROUND
reduced muscle mass is a hallmark of metabolic diseases like diabetes and cancer. the mammalian  target of rapamycin complex 1/s <dig> kinase  <dig>  pathway is critical to the regulation of muscle protein synthesis and mass but its mechanism of action is not completely understood.


RESULTS
using l <dig> myotubes, we characterized the regulation of programmed cell death  <dig> , a recently described substrate of s6k <dig>  the abundance, but not ser <dig> phosphorylation, of pdcd <dig> was sensitive to amino acid and serum deprivation: values in starved cells were  <dig> x of control . refeeding had opposite effects. growth factors, compared to amino acids, appeared more critical in regulating pdcd <dig> abundance. furthermore, inhibition of mtorc <dig> or the proteasome prevented the refeeding-associated decrease in pdcd <dig> abundance. amino acid and serum deprivation significantly increased pdcd <dig> binding to eif4a ; this was reversed during refeeding. pdcd <dig> depletion by rna interference had no significant effect on phenylalanine incorporation into myotube mixed proteins in control cells but further suppressed  this measure in nutrient-deprived cells . this was not observed in myoblasts. in starved myotubes, pdcd <dig> depletion further reduced the association of eif4g with eif4e.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that in myotubes, pdcd <dig> abundance is sensitive to nutritional manipulation in an mtorc <dig> and proteasome depended manner. furthermore, the role of pdcd <dig> in regulating protein synthesis appears dependent on the developmental state of the cell.
