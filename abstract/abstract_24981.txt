BACKGROUND
the retroviral oncogene v-myb encodes a transcription factor  which is responsible for the transformation of myelomonocytic cells by avian myeloblastosis virus . v-myb is thought to exert its biological effects by deregulating the expression of specific target genes. we have recently demonstrated that the chicken gas <dig> gene, whose promoter co-localizes with an origin of dna replication, is a bona fide myb target gene. because of this finding we have asked whether other myb-regulated genes are also associated with dna replication origins.


RESULTS
we show that the promoter region of the chicken adenosine receptor 2b gene , a known myb-target gene, acts as a dna replication origin. furthermore, we have examined known replication origins for the presence of myb binding sites. we found that the intergenic region between the genes for the minichromosome maintenance  <dig> protein  and the catalytic subunit of dna-dependent protein kinase , whose human counterpart has been identified as a replication origin, contains a number of myb binding sites. our data show that this region also acts as an origin of replication in chicken cells. interestingly, we found that the chicken mcm <dig> gene is also myb-regulated.


CONCLUSIONS
our work identifies the chicken mcm <dig> gene as a novel myb target gene and presents evidence for the co-localization of two novel origins of dna replication with myb-regulated genes. our work raises the possibility that a fraction of myb target gene promoters is associated with dna replication origins.
