BACKGROUND
tc <dig> of trypanosoma cruzi has been isolated as a single stranded dna binding protein with high specificity for the poly  sequence. it is present only in kinetoplastidae protozoa and its sequence lacks homology to known functional domains. tc <dig> orthologues present in trypanosoma brucei and leishmania were proposed to participate in quite different cellular processes. to further understand the function of this protein in trypanosoma cruzi, we examined its in vitro binding to biologically relevant  enriched sequences, its expression and subcellular localization during the cell cycle and through the parasite life stages.


RESULTS
by using specific antibodies, we found that tc <dig> protein from epimastigote extracts participates in complexes with the poly  probe as well as with the universal minicircle sequence , a related repeated sequence found in maxicircle dna, and the telomeric repeat. however, we found that tc <dig> predominantly localizes into the mitochondrion. though tc <dig> is constitutively expressed through non-replicating and replicating life stages of t. cruzi, its subcellular localization in the unique parasite mitochondrion changes according to the cell cycle stage. in epimastigotes, tc <dig> is found only in association with kdna in g <dig> phase. from the s to g <dig> phase the protein localizes in two defined and connected spots flanking the kdna. these spots disappear in late g <dig> turning into a diffuse dotted signal which extends beyond the kinetoplast. this later pattern is more evident in mitosis and cytokinesis. finally, late in cytokinesis tc <dig> reacquires its association with the kinetoplast. in non-replicating parasite stages such as trypomastigotes, the protein is found only surrounding the entire kinetoplast structure.


CONCLUSIONS
the dynamics of tc <dig> subcellular localization observed during the cell cycle and life stages support a major role for tc <dig> related to kdna replication and maintenance.
