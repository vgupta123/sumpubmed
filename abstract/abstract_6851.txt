BACKGROUND
safb <dig> is a rna binding protein implicated in the regulation of multiple cellular processes such as the regulation of transcription, stress response, dna repair and rna processing. to gain further insight into safb <dig> function we used iclip and mapped its interaction with rna on a genome wide level.


RESULTS
iclip analysis found safb <dig> binding was enriched, specifically in exons, ncrnas, 3’ and 5’ untranslated regions. safb <dig> was found to recognise a purine-rich gaaga motif with the highest frequency and it is therefore likely to bind core aga, gaa, or aag motifs. confirmatory rt-pcr experiments showed that the expression of coding and non-coding genes with safb <dig> cross-link sites was altered by safb <dig> knockdown. for example, we found that the isoform-specific expression of neural cell adhesion molecule  and astn <dig> was influenced by safb <dig> and that the processing of mir-19a from the mir-17- <dig> cluster was regulated by safb <dig>  these data suggest safb <dig> may influence alternative splicing and, using an ncam <dig> minigene, we showed that safb <dig> knockdown altered the expression of two of the three ncam <dig> alternative spliced isoforms. however, when the aga, gaa, and aag motifs were mutated, safb <dig> knockdown no longer mediated a decrease in the ncam <dig> 9– <dig> alternative spliced form. to further investigate the association of safb <dig> with splicing we used exon array analysis and found safb <dig> knockdown mediated the statistically significant up- and downregulation of alternative exons. further analysis using rnamotifs to investigate the frequency of association between the motif pairs  and alternative spliced exons found there was a highly significant correlation with downregulated exons. together, our data suggest safb <dig> will play an important physiological role in the central nervous system regulating synaptic function. we found that safb <dig> regulates dendritic spine density in hippocampal neurons and hence provide empirical evidence supporting this conclusion.


CONCLUSIONS
iclip showed that safb <dig> has previously uncharacterised specific rna binding properties that help coordinate the isoform-specific expression of coding and non-coding genes. these genes regulate splicing, axonal and synaptic function, and are associated with neuropsychiatric disease, suggesting that safb <dig> is an important regulator of key neuronal processes.
