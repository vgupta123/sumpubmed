BACKGROUND
the infections caused by antibiotic multidrug-resistant bacteria seriously threaten human health. to prevent and cure the infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, new antimicrobial agents are required. antimicrobial peptides are ideal therapy candidates for antibiotic-resistant pathogens. however, due to high production costs, novel methods of large-scale production are urgently needed.


RESULTS
the novel plectasin-derived antimicrobial peptide-mp <dig> gene was constitutively expressed under the control of the gap promoter. the optimum carbon source and concentration were determined, and 4% glucose  was initially selected as the best carbon source. six media were assayed for the improved yield of recombinant mp <dig> . the total protein and rmp <dig> yield was  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  mg/l, which was accomplished via the use of medium number  <dig>  the peptone and yeast extract from hongrun baoshun  more effectively improved the total protein and the yield of rmp <dig> to  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  mg/l compared to  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  mg/l that resulted from oxoid . furthermore, we observed that the total protein, antimicrobial activity and rmp <dig> yield from the fermentation supernatant increased from  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig>  au/ml, and  <dig>  mg/l, respectively, in ph <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig>  au/ml and  <dig>  mg/ml, respectively in ph  <dig>  in a 5-l fermenter. accordingly, the productivity increased from 104464 au/mg rmp <dig> in ph  <dig>  to a maximum of 285412 au/mg rmp <dig> in ph  <dig> . finally, the recombinant mp <dig> was purified with a cation-exchange column with a yield of  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig> % purity, and a molecular weight of  <dig>  da, which was consistent with its theoretical value of 4383 da.


CONCLUSIONS
it’s the highest level of antimicrobial peptides expressed in pichia pastoris using gap promoter so far. these results provide an economical method for the high-level production of rmp <dig> under the control of the gap promoter.
