BACKGROUND
oxidative stress and large amounts of nitric oxide  have been implicated in the pathophysiology of neuronal injury and neurodegenerative disease. recent studies have shown that -epigallocatechin gallate , one of the green tea polyphenols, has potent antioxidant effects against free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation in ischemia-induced neuronal damage. the purpose of this study was to examine whether egcg would attenuate neuronal expression of nadph-d/nnos in the motor neurons of the lower brainstem following peripheral nerve crush. thus, young adult rats were treated with egcg   <dig> min prior to crushing their hypoglossal and vagus nerves for  <dig> seconds . the treatment  was continued from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  and the animals were sacrificed on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase  histochemistry and neuronal nitric oxide synthase  immunohistochemistry were used to assess neuronal nadph-d/nnos expression in the hypoglossal nucleus and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus.


RESULTS
in rats treated with high dosages of egcg , nadph-d/nnos reactivity and cell death of the motor neurons were significantly decreased.


CONCLUSIONS
the present evidence indicated that egcg can reduce nadph-d/nnos reactivity and thus may enhance motor neuron survival time following peripheral nerve injury.
