BACKGROUND
massively parallel cdna sequencing  experiments are gradually superseding microarrays in quantitative gene expression profiling. however, many biologists are uncertain about the choice of differentially expressed gene  analysis methods and the validity of cost-saving sample pooling strategies for their rna-seq experiments. hence, we performed experimental validation of degs identified by cuffdiff <dig>  edger, deseq <dig> and two-stage poisson model  in a rna-seq experiment involving mice amygdalae micro-punches, using high-throughput qpcr on independent biological replicate samples. moreover, we sequenced rna-pools and compared their results with sequencing corresponding individual rna samples.


RESULTS
false-positivity rate of cuffdiff <dig> and false-negativity rates of deseq <dig> and tspm were high. among the four investigated deg analysis methods, sensitivity and specificity of edger was relatively high. we documented the pooling bias and that the degs identified in pooled samples suffered low positive predictive values.


CONCLUSIONS
our results highlighted the need for combined use of more sensitive deg analysis methods and high-throughput validation of identified degs in future rna-seq experiments. they indicated limited utility of sample pooling strategies for rna-seq in similar setups and supported increasing the number of biological replicate samples.
