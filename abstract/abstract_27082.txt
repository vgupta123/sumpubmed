BACKGROUND
sweetpotato  lam.), a hexaploid outcrossing crop, is an important staple and food security crop in developing countries in africa and asia. the availability of genomic resources for sweetpotato is in striking contrast to its importance for human nutrition. previously existing sequence data were restricted to around  <dig>  expressed sequence tag  sequences and ~  <dig>  genbank sequences. we have used  <dig> pyrosequencing to augment the available gene sequence information to enhance functional genomics and marker design for this plant species.


RESULTS
two quarter  <dig> pyrosequencing runs used two normalized cdna collections from stems and leaves from drought-stressed sweetpotato clone tanzania and yielded  <dig>  reads, which were assembled together with  <dig>  publically available expressed sequence tags into  <dig>  sets of overlapping dna segments and  <dig>  unassembled sequences. blastx comparisons with the uniref <dig> database allowed annotation of  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons resulting in  <dig>  putatively unique genes. further,  <dig>  sequences had no match to protein sequences of uniref100database. on the basis of this gene index, we have identified  <dig>  gene-based microsatellite sequences, of which  <dig> were selected for testing and  <dig> were successfully amplified in a test panel of  <dig> hexaploid  and  <dig> diploid  accessions.


CONCLUSIONS
the sweetpotato gene index is a useful source for functionally annotated sweetpotato gene sequences that contains three times more gene sequence information for sweetpotato than previous est assemblies. a searchable version of the gene index, including a blastn function, is available at http://www.cipotato.org/sweetpotato_gene_index.
