BACKGROUND
accurate and automatic gene finding and structural prediction is a common problem in bioinformatics, and applications need to be capable of handling non-canonical splice sites, micro-exons and partial gene structure predictions that span across several genomic clones.


RESULTS
we present a mrna/dna homology based gene structure prediction tool, gigogene. we use a new affine gap penalty splice-enhanced global alignment algorithm running in linear memory for a high quality annotation of splice sites. our tool includes a novel algorithm to assemble partial gene structure predictions using interval graphs. gigogene exhibited a sensitivity of  <dig> % and a specificity of  <dig> % on the genie learning set, and demonstrated a higher quality of gene structural prediction when compared to sim <dig>  est2genome, spidey, galahad and blat, including when genes contained micro-exons and non-canonical splice sites. gigogene showed an acceptable loss of prediction quality when confronted with a noisy genie learning set simulating ests.


CONCLUSIONS
gigogene shows a higher quality of gene structure prediction for mrna/dna spliced alignment when compared to other available tools.
