BACKGROUND
in many species males face a higher predation risk than females because males display elaborate traits that evolved under sexual selection, which may attract not only females but also predators. females are, therefore, predicted to avoid such conspicuous males under predation risk. the present study was designed to investigate predator-induced changes of female mating preferences in atlantic mollies . males of this species show a pronounced polymorphism in body size and coloration, and females prefer large, colorful males in the absence of predators.


RESULTS
in dichotomous choice tests predator-na√Øve  females altered their initial preference for larger males in the presence of the cichlid cichlasoma salvini, a natural predator of p. mexicana, and preferred small males instead. this effect was considerably weaker when females were confronted visually with the non-piscivorous cichlid vieja bifasciata or the introduced non-piscivorous nile tilapia . in contrast, predator experienced  females did not respond to the same extent to the presence of a predator, most likely due to a learned ability to evaluate their predators' motivation to prey.


CONCLUSIONS
our study highlights that  predatory fish can have a profound influence on the expression of mating preferences of their prey , and females may alter their mate choice behavior strategically to reduce their own exposure to predators.  prey species can evolve visual predator recognition mechanisms and alter their mate choice only when a natural predator is present.  finally, experiential effects can play an important role, and prey species may learn to evaluate the motivational state of their predators.
