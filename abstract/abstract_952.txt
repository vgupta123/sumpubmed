BACKGROUND
the positive antimicrobial effects of increasing concentrations of thiocyanate  and h2o <dig> on the human peroxidase defence system are well known. however, little is known about the quantitative efficacy of the human peroxidase thiocyanate h2o <dig> system regarding streptococcus mutans and sanguinis, as well as candida albicans. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the enzyme lactoperoxidase on the bactericidal and fungicidal effectiveness of a thiocyanate-h2o <dig> combination above the physiological saliva level. to evaluate the optimal effectiveness curve, the exposure times were restricted to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> min.


RESULTS
the bactericidal and fungicidal effects of lactoperoxidase on streptococcus mutans and sanguinis and candida albicans were evaluated by using two test mixtures of a  <dig> %  thiocyanate and  <dig> %  hydrogen peroxide solution, one without and one with lactoperoxidase. following the quantitative suspension tests , the growth of surviving bacteria and fungi in a nutrient broth was measured. the reduction factor in the suspension test without lactoperoxidase enzyme was <  <dig> for all three tested organisms. thus, the mixtures of  <dig> %  thiocyanate and  <dig> %  hydrogen peroxide had no in vitro antimicrobial effect on streptococcus mutans and sanguinis or candida albicans. however, the suspension test with lactoperoxidase showed a high bactericidal and fungicidal effectiveness in vitro.


CONCLUSIONS
the tested thiocyanate and h2o <dig> mixtures showed no relevant antimicrobial effect. however, by adding lactoperoxidase enzyme, the mixtures became not only an effective bactericidal  but also a fungicidal  agent.
