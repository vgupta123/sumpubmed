BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  is one of the most economically important viral diseases affecting swine industry worldwide. despite routine farm vaccination, effective control strategies for prrs remained elusive which underscores the need for in-depth studies to gain insight into the host immune response to vaccines. the current study aimed to investigate transcriptional responses to prrs virus  vaccine in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells  within 3 days following vaccination in german landrace pigs.


RESULTS
transcriptome profiling of pbmcs from prrsv vaccinated and age-matched unvaccinated pigs at right before , and at  <dig>   <dig> and 72 h after prrsv vaccination was performed using the affymetrix gene chip porcine gene  <dig>  st array. comparison of pbmcs transcriptome profiles between vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs revealed a distinct host innate immune transcriptional response to prrsv vaccine. there was a significant temporal variation in transcriptional responses of prrsv vaccine in pbmcs accounting  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> differentially expressed genes  at  <dig>   <dig> and 72 h post vaccination, respectively compared to the time point before vaccination . gene ontology analysis revealed the involvement of these degs in various biological process including innate immune response, signal transduction, positive regulation of map kinase activity, trif-dependent toll-like receptor signaling pathway, t cell differentiation and apoptosis. immune response specific pathways such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling pathway, signal transduction, jak-stat pathway and regulation, traf <dig> mediated induction of nf-kb and mapk, the nlrp <dig> inflammasome, endocytosis and interferon signaling were under regulation during the early stage of prrsv vaccination. network enrichment analysis revealed app, traf <dig>  pin <dig>  fos, ctnnb <dig>  tnfaip <dig>  tip <dig>  cdkn <dig>  sirt <dig>  esr <dig> and hdac <dig> as the highly interconnected hubs of the functional network of prrsv vaccine induced transcriptome changes in pbmcs.


CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that a massive gene expression change occurred in pbmcs following prrsv vaccination in german landrace pigs. within first 3 days of vaccine exposure, the highest transcript abundance was observed at 24 h after vaccination compared to that of control. results of this study suggest that app, traf <dig>  pin <dig>  fos, cdkn1a and tnfaip <dig> could be considered as potential candidate genes for prrsv vaccine responsiveness.
