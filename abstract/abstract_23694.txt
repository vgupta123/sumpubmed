BACKGROUND
the objective of this study was to provide for the first time data on plasma catecholamines, cortisol, glutathione and malondialdehyde after long term dehydration  in the presence and absence of angiotensin ii  at <dig> receptor blocker  versus levels in time-matched, non-dehydrated control camels and to record the responses of glutathione and malondialdehyde activity in liver and kidney homogenates in control, dehydrated-losartan treated and dehydrated camels. eighteen male camels were studied, six hydrated , six dehydrated and treated with losartan  and six dehydrated not treated .


RESULTS
plasma levels of norepinephrine and dopamine were significantly increased  in both treated and dehydrated groups compared to time matched control, whereas plasma epinephrine level showed significant decrease  in both treated and dehydrated groups compared to control. plasma cortisol also showed significant increase  in both treated and dehydrated groups compared to control. glutathione levels in plasma, liver and kidney homogenates for both treated and dehydrated groups reveled significant increase  likewise, malondialdehyde levels in plasma, liver and kidney homogenates were substantially and significantly increased in both treated and dehydrated groups.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the results of this study demonstrated that dehydration substantially increased the circulating levels of norepinephrine, dopamine and cortisol but decreased plasma epinephrine. similarly, losartan showed similar effects to that of dehydration. in addition, this investigation showed dehydration alone or in combination with losartan induced significant increments in glutathione and malondialdehyde activities in plasma, liver and kidney homogenates, presumably in order to counteract the potentially damaging effects of free radicals. blockade of angiotensin ii at <dig> receptors did not alter significantly the response of dehydration in any of these indices.
