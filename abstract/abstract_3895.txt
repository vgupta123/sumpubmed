BACKGROUND
ophiocordyceps sinensis , endemic to alpine regions on the tibetan plateau, is one of the most valuable medicinal fungi in the world. huge commercial demand has led to excessive harvest and a dramatic decline in its numbers. the diversity of terrains and climates on the tibetan plateau and the broad insect host range  may have resulted in substantial intraspecific genetic diversity for this fungus. the objective of this study was to evaluate the population distribution of o. sinensis from geographically diverse regions of the tibetan plateau based on nrdna its and mat1-2- <dig> gene sequences. understanding of the genetic diversity and genesis of o. sinensis will provide important information for the evolution and conservation of this fungus.


RESULTS
significant sequence variations in the its and mat1-2- <dig> genes  were observed. phylogenetic analysis based on its sequences, mat1-2- <dig> sequences, or their combined data set, clustered isolates from northern regions in one clade , whereas isolates from southern regions were dispersed in all four clades . single-strand conformation polymorphism  analyses of  <dig> its clones from seven samples revealed  <dig> different sscp patterns that were subsequently sequenced. its heterogeneity was found in xz-lz07-h <dig> , and  <dig> informative sites and five haplotypes were detected from  <dig> clones. the five haplotypes clustered into three clades .


CONCLUSIONS
significant genetic divergence in o. sinensis was observed and the genetic diversification was greater among southern isolates than that among northern isolates. the polymorphism of nrdna its sequences suggested that o. sinensis spread from a center of origin  to southern regions and subsequently to northern areas. these results suggest that southern populations are important reservoirs of genetic diversity and should be taken into account in conservation programs.
