BACKGROUND
dna sequences afford access to the evolutionary pathways of life. particularly mobile elements that constantly co-evolve in genomes encrypt recent and ancient information of their host's history. in mammals there is an extraordinarily abundant activity of mobile elements that occurs in a dynamic succession of active families, subfamilies, types, and subtypes of retroposed elements. the high frequency of retroposons in mammals implies that, by chance, such elements also insert into each other. while inactive elements are no longer able to retropose, active elements retropose by chance into other active and inactive elements. thousands of such directional, element-in-element insertions are found in present-day genomes. to help analyze these events, we developed a computational algorithm  that examines the different frequencies of nested transpositions and reconstructs the chronological order of retroposon activities.


RESULTS
by examining the different frequencies of such nested transpositions, the tint application reconstructs the chronological order of retroposon activities. we use such activity patterns as a comparative tool to  delineate the historical rise and fall of retroposons and their relations to each other,  understand the retroposon-induced complexity of recent genomes, and  find selective informative homoplasy-free markers of phylogeny. the efficiency of the new application is demonstrated by applying it to dimeric alu short interspersed elements  to derive a complete chronology of such elements in primates.


CONCLUSIONS
the user-friendly, web-based tint interface presented here affords an easy, automated screening for nested transpositions from genome assemblies or trace data, assembles them in a frequency-matrix, and schematically displays their chronological activity history.
