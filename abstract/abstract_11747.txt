BACKGROUND
sal <dig>  is a member of the obp  family and is involved in chemical sexual communication in pig. sal <dig> and its relatives may be involved in pheromone and olfactory receptor binding and in pre-mating behaviour. the evolutionary history and the selective pressures acting on sal <dig> and its orthologous genes have not yet been exhaustively described. the aim of the present work was to study the evolution of these genes, to elucidate the role of selective pressures in their evolution and the consequences for their functions.


RESULTS
here, we present the evolutionary history of sal <dig> gene and its orthologous genes in mammals. we found that  sal <dig> and its related genes arose in eutherian mammals with lineage-specific duplications in rodents, horse and cow and are lost in human, mouse lemur, bushbaby and orangutan,  the evolution of duplicated genes of horse, rat, mouse and guinea pig is driven by concerted evolution with extensive gene conversion events in mouse and guinea pig and by positive selection mainly acting on paralogous genes in horse and guinea pig,  positive selection was detected for amino acids involved in pheromone binding and amino acids putatively involved in olfactory receptor binding,  positive selection was also found for lineage, indicating a species-specific strategy for amino acid selection.


CONCLUSIONS
this work provides new insights into the evolutionary history of sal <dig> and its orthologs. on one hand, some genes are subject to concerted evolution and to an increase in dosage, suggesting the need for homogeneity of sequence and function in certain species. on the other hand, positive selection plays a role in the diversification of the functions of the family and in lineage, suggesting adaptive evolution, with possible consequences for speciation and for the reinforcement of prezygotic barriers.
