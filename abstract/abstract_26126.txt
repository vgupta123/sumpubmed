BACKGROUND
multipotent stem cells exist within adipose tissue throughout life. an abnormal recruitment of these adipose precursor cells could participate to hyperplasia of adipose tissue observed in severe obesity or to hypoplasia of adipose tissue observed in lipodystrophy. therefore, pharmacological molecules that control the pool of stem cells in adipose tissue are of great interest. glycogen synthase kinase   <dig> has been previously described as involved in differentiation of preadipose cells and might be a potential therapeutic target to modulate proliferation and differentiation of adipocyte precursors. however, the impact of gsk <dig> inhibition on human adipose-derived stem cells remained to be investigated. the aim of this study was to investigate gsk <dig> as a possible target for pharmacological inhibition of stem cell adipogenesis. to reach this goal, we studied the effects of pharmacological inhibitors of gsk <dig>  i.e. lithium chloride  and bio on proliferation and adipocyte differentiation of multipotent stem cells derived from human adipose tissue.


RESULTS
our results showed that gsk <dig> inhibitors inhibited proliferation and clonogenicity of human stem cells, strongly suggesting that gsk <dig> inhibitors could be potent regulators of the pool of adipocyte precursors in adipose tissue. the impact of gsk <dig> inhibition on differentiation of hmads cells was also investigated. adipogenic and osteogenic differentiations were inhibited upon hmads treatment with bio. whereas a chronic treatment was required to inhibit osteogenesis, a treatment that was strictly restricted to the early step of differentiation was sufficient to inhibit adipogenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrated the feasibility of a pharmacological approach to regulate adipose-derived stem cell function and that gsk <dig> could represent a potential target for controlling adipocyte precursor pool under conditions where fat tissue formation is impaired.
