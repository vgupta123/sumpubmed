BACKGROUND
mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascades play a crucial role in plant growth and development as well as biotic and abiotic stress responses. knowledge about the mapk gene family in cotton is limited, and systematic investigation of mapk family proteins has not been reported.


RESULTS
by performing a bioinformatics homology search, we identified  <dig> putative mapk genes in the gossypium raimondii genome. these mapk members were anchored onto  <dig> chromosomes in g. raimondii, with uneven distribution. phylogenetic analysis showed that the mapk candidates could be classified into the four known a, b, c and d groups, with more mapks containing the tey phosphorylation site  than the tdy motif . furthermore,  <dig> cdna sequences of mapks with complete open reading frames  were identified in g. hirsutum via pcr-based approaches, including  <dig> novel mapks and eight with homologs reported previously in tetraploid cotton. the expression patterns of  <dig> mapk genes reveal their important roles in diverse functions in cotton, in both various developmental stages of vegetative and reproductive growth and in the stress response. using a reverse genetics approach based on tobacco rattle virus-induced gene silencing , we further verified that mpk <dig>  mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> confer resistance to defoliating isolates of verticillium dahliae in cotton. silencing of mpk <dig>  mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> can significantly enhance cotton susceptibility to this pathogen.


CONCLUSIONS
this study presents a comprehensive identification of  <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase genes in g. raimondii. their phylogenetic relationships, transcript expression patterns and responses to various stressors were verified. this study provides the first systematic analysis of mapks in cotton, improving our understanding of defense responses in general and laying the foundation for future crop improvement using mapks.
