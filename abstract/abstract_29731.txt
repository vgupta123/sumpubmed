BACKGROUND
to assess and to compare the renal volume evolution in bitches during pregnancy by two-dimensional  ultrasonography using the ellipsoid technique  and three-dimensional  ultrasonography using the virtual organ computer-aided analysis  method. a longitudinal prospective study was performed with  <dig> normal golden retrievers bitches during pregnancy from heat to the last third of gestation. the ultrasound scans were performed by two veterinarians. the left and right kidneys were assessed in three moments  by three techniques . for reproducibility calculations, we used the intraclass correlation coefficient .


RESULTS
the inferential result of the volumes in anova revealed the interaction effect between side and moment . the 3d techniques showed, in average, the same renal volumes  regardless of the side and moment. considering the right side, the renal volume in the day  <dig> was smaller than the day 21st to 40th . considering the left side, the renal volume at day  <dig> was smaller than the day 1st to 20th  and day 21st to 40th . it was found good intra observer reproducibility  and none of the three techniques showed a good inter observer reproducibility .


CONCLUSIONS
the renal volume bitches by 3d ultrasonography using the vocal method  had good correlation with the volume obtained by 2d ultrasonography method.
