BACKGROUND
advances made in the area of microarray comparative genomic hybridization  have enabled the interrogation of the entire genome at a previously unattainable resolution. this has lead to the discovery of a novel class of alternative entities called large-scale copy number variations . these cnvs are often found in regions of closely linked sequence homology called duplicons that are thought to facilitate genomic rearrangements in some classes of neoplasia. recently, it was proposed that duplicons located near the recurrent translocation break points on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in chronic myeloid leukemia  may facilitate this tumor-specific translocation. furthermore, ~15â€“20% of cml patients also carry a microdeletion on the derivative  <dig> chromosome ) and these patients have a poor prognosis. it has been hypothesised that der deletion patients have increased levels of chromosomal instability.


RESULTS
in this study acgh was performed and identified a cnv  that was present as a genomic gain or loss in 10% of control dna samples derived from cytogenetically normal individuals. cnv14q <dig> was the same clone identified by iafrate et al. as a cnv. real-time polymerase chain reaction  was used to determine the relative frequency of this cnv in dna from a series of  <dig> cml patients  deletion) together with dna derived from  <dig> paediatric solid tumors in comparison to the incidence of cnv in control dna. cnv14q <dig> was present in ~50% of both tumor and cml dna, but was found in 72% of cml bearing a der microdeletion. chi square analysis found a statistically significant difference  between the incidence of this cnv in cancer and normal dna and a slightly increased incidence in cml with deletions in comparison to those cml without a detectable deletion.


CONCLUSIONS
the increased incidence of cnv14q <dig> in tumor samples suggests that either acquired or inherited genomic variation of this new class of variation may be associated with onset or progression of neoplasia.
