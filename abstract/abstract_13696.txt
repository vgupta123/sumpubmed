BACKGROUND
the coiled-coil coactivator  enhances transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors, the xenobiotic aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and the lymphocyte enhancer factors  in the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. cocoa is comprised of a large central coiled coil domain flanked by n-terminal and c-terminal activation domains . the n-terminal ad of cocoa is required for coactivator function with lef and β-catenin, while the c-terminal ad of cocoa is required for coactivator function with nuclear receptors. we explored the role of sumoylation in regulating the activities of the two ads and the coactivator function of cocoa.


RESULTS
the n-terminus of cocoa is covalently modified by sumo <dig> at lys-29; both pias <dig> and arip <dig> function as e <dig> ligases. fusion of sumo <dig> to the n-terminus  reduced coactivator function of cocoa with lef <dig> and the activity of the n-terminal ad. the n- and c-termini of cocoa can bind to each other, and c-terminal transactivation activity is attenuated in the presence of the n-terminus, indicating that the n-c interaction regulates the activity of the c-terminal ad. fusion of sumo <dig> to the n-terminal fragment of cocoa reduced the n-c interaction and inhibition of c-terminal ad activity by the n-terminal fragment.


CONCLUSIONS
sumoylation of cocoa differentially regulates the coactivator activity of cocoa with nuclear receptors versus lef <dig>  by attenuating the n-terminal ad activity and enhancing the activity of the c-terminal ad.
