BACKGROUND
the atlantic salmon  immunoglobulin heavy chain  locus possesses two parallel igh isoloci , that are related to the genomic duplication event in the family salmonidae. these duplicated igh loci in atlantic salmon provide a unique opportunity to examine the mechanisms of genome diversity and genome evolution of the igh loci in vertebrates. in this study, we defined the structure of these loci in atlantic salmon, and sequenced  <dig> bacterial artificial chromosome  clones that were assembled into the igh-a  and igh-b  loci. in addition, over  <dig>  cdna clones from the igh variable  region have been sequenced and analyzed.


RESULTS
the present study shows that the genomic organization of the duplicated igh loci in atlantic salmon differs from that in other teleosts and other vertebrates. the loci possess multiple cτ genes upstream of the cμ region, with three of the cτ genes being functional. moreover, the duplicated loci possess over  <dig> vh segments which could be classified into  <dig> families. this is the largest number of vh families currently defined in any vertebrate. there were significant structural differences between the two loci, indicating that both igh-a and -b loci have evolved independently in the short time after the recent genome duplication approximately  <dig> mya.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the duplication of the igh loci in atlantic salmon significantly contributes to the increased diversity of the antibody repertoire, as compared with the single igh locus in other vertebrates.
