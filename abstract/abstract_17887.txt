BACKGROUND
scrapie is a chronic neurodegenerative disease affecting small ruminants and belongs to the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. scrapie is considered a serious animal disease and it has been notifiable in norway since  <dig>  the clinical signs of scrapie might be vague and the farmers, if familiar with the signs of scrapie, are often in the best position for detecting scrapie suspects. in  <dig>  an anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted in order to assess norwegian sheep farmers' vigilance of scrapie.


RESULTS
although the potential detection of a scrapie-positive animal would lead to the destruction of the sheep flock concerned, almost all the farmers  expressed their willingness to report scrapie suspects. this was most certainly dependent on the government taking the economic responsibility for the control programme as nearly all the farmers responded that this was an important condition. listeriosis is relatively common disease in norwegian sheep and a differential diagnosis for scrapie. in a multinomial logistic regression the reporting behaviour for non-recovering listeriosis cases, used as a measurement of willingness to report scrapie, was examined. the reporting of non-recovering listeriosis cases increased as the knowledge of scrapie-associated signs increased, and the reporting behaviour was dependent on both economic and non-economic values.


CONCLUSIONS
the results indicate that in  <dig> almost all sheep farmers showed willingness to report any scrapie suspects. nevertheless there is an underreporting of scrapie suspects and the farmers' awareness and hence their vigilance of scrapie could be improved. furthermore, the results suggest that to ensure the farmers' compliance to control programmes for serious infectious diseases, the farmers' concerns of non-economic as well as economic values should be considered.
