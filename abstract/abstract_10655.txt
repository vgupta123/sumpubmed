BACKGROUND
endothelin- <dig>  is a potent vasoactive peptide, which induces vasoconstriction and proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells  through activation of endothelin type a  and type b  receptors. the extracellular signal-regulated kinase  <dig> and  <dig>  mitogen-activated protein kinases  are involved in et-1-induced vsmc contraction and proliferation. this study was designed to investigate the eta and etb receptor intracellular signaling in human vsmcs and used phosphorylation  of erk1/ <dig> as a functional signal molecule for endothelin receptor activity.


RESULTS
subconfluent human vsmcs were stimulated by et- <dig> at different concentrations . the activation of erk1/ <dig> was examined by immunofluorescence, western blot and phosphoelisa using specific antibody against phosphorylated erk1/ <dig> protein. et- <dig> induced a concentration- and time- dependent activation of erk1/ <dig> with a maximal effect at  <dig> min. it declined to baseline level at  <dig> min. the et-1-induced activation of erk1/ <dig> was completely abolished by mek1/ <dig> inhibitors u <dig> and sl <dig>  and partially inhibited by the mek <dig> inhibitor pd <dig>  a dual endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan or the eta antagonist bq <dig> blocked the et- <dig> effect, while the etb antagonist bq <dig> had no significant effect. however, a selective etb receptor agonist, sarafotoxin 6c  caused a time-dependent erk1/ <dig> activation with a maximal effect by less than 20% of the et-1-induced activation of erk1/ <dig>  increase in bosentan concentration up to  <dig> Î¼m further inhibited et-1-induced activation of erk1/ <dig> and had a stronger inhibitory effect than bq <dig> or the combined use of bq <dig> and bq <dig>  to further explore et- <dig> intracellular signaling, pkc inhibitors , pkc-delta inhibitor , pka inhibitor , and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  inhibitor  were applied. the inhibitors showed significant inhibitory effects on et-1-induced activation of erk1/ <dig>  however, blockage of l-type ca2+ channels or calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii, chelating extracellular ca2+ or emptying internal ca2+ stores, did not affect et-1-induced activation of erk1/ <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the eta receptors predominate in the et-1-induced activation of erk1/ <dig> in human vsmcs, which associates with increments in intracellular pkc, pka and pi3k activities, but not ca2+ signalling.
