BACKGROUND
salmonellae are major worldwide zoonotic pathogens infecting a wide range of vertebrate species including humans. consumption of contaminated dairy products and contact with dairy cattle represent a common source of non-typhoidal salmonella infection in humans. despite a large number of small-scale dairy farms in addis ababa and its surrounding districts, little is known about the status of salmonella in these farms.


RESULTS
salmonella was recovered from the feces of at least one animal in  <dig>  %  of the dairy farms. out of  <dig> fecal samples examined,  <dig> were positive for salmonella resulting in a weighted animal level prevalence of  <dig>  %. detection of diarrhea in an animal and in a farm was significantly associated with animal level  and herd level  prevalence of salmonella. animal level prevalence of salmonella was significantly associated with age  and study location; it was highest among those under 6 months of age and in farms from adaa district and addis ababa . nine different serotypes were identified using standard serological agglutination tests. the most frequently recovered serotypes were salmonella typhimurium , s. saintpaul , s. kentucky  and s. virchow . all isolates were resistant or intermediately resistant to at least one of the  <dig> drugs tested. twenty-six ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  of the isolates were resistant to streptomycin, nitrofurantoin, sulfisoxazole and tetracycline , respectively. resistance to  <dig> drugs was detected in 27  of the isolates. resistance to  <dig> or more drugs was detected in  <dig>  of the isolates, while resistance to  <dig> or more drugs was detected in  <dig>  of the isolates. the rate of occurrence of multi-drug resistance  in salmonella strains isolated from dairy farms in addis ababa was significantly higher than those isolated from farms outside of addis ababa . mdr was more common in s. kentucky, s. virchow and s. saintpaul.


CONCLUSIONS
isolation of salmonella serotypes commonly known for causing human salmonellosis that are associated with an mdr phenotype in dairy farms in close proximity with human population is a major public health concern. these findings imply the need for a strict pathogen reduction strategy.
