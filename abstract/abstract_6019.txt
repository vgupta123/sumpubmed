BACKGROUND
to explore the morphological evidence of immunoglobulin g  participating in intestinal mucosal immunity,  <dig> healthy adult bactrian camels used. first, igg was successfully isolated from their serum and rabbit antibody against bactrian camels igg was prepared. the igg antibody secretory cells  in small intestine were particularly observed through immumohistochemical staining, then after were analyzed by statistical methods.


RESULTS
the results showed that the igg ascs were scattered in the lamina propria  and some of them aggregated around of the intestinal glands. the igg ascs density was the highest from middle segment of duodenum to middle segment of jejunum, and then in ended segment of jejunum and initial segment of ileum, the lowest was in initial segment of duodenum, in middle and ended segment of ileum.


CONCLUSIONS
it was demonstrated that the igg ascs mainly scattered in the effector sites of the mucosal immunity, though the density of igg ascs was different in different segment of small intestine. moreover, this scatted distribution characteristic would provide a morphology basis for research whether igg form a full-protection and immune surveillance in mucosal immunity homeostasis of integral intestine.
