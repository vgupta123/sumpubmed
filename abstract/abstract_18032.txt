BACKGROUND
in humans and mice  less than 5% of the peripheral blood t lymphocytes are gamma/delta t cells, whereas in chicken and artiodactyls  gamma/delta t cells represent about half of the t cells in peripheral blood. in cattle and sheep  two paralogous t cell receptor gamma loci  have been found. trg <dig> is located on 4q <dig> , within a region of homology with the human trg locus on chromosome  <dig>  while trg <dig> localizes on 4q <dig>  and appears to be unique to ruminants. the purpose of this study was the sequencing of the genomic regions encompassing both loci in a "γδ high" organism and the analysis of their evolutionary history.


RESULTS
we obtained the contiguous genomic sequences of the complete sheep trg <dig> and trg <dig> loci gene repertoire and we performed cattle/sheep sequence analysis comparison using data available through public databases. dot plot similarity matrix comparing the two sheep loci with each other has shown that variable , joining  and constant  genes have evolved through a series of duplication events involving either entire cassettes, each containing the basic v-j-j-c recombinational unit, or single v genes. the phylogenetic behaviour of the eight enhancer-like elements found in the sheep, compared with the single copy present in the human trg locus, and evidence from concordant insertions of repetitive elements in all analyzed trgj blocks allowed us to infer an evolutionary scenario which highlights the genetic "flexibility" of this region and the duplication-driven evolution of gene cassettes. the strong similarity of the human and bovidae intergenic j-j-c regions, which display an enhancer-like element at their 3' ends, further supports their key role in duplications.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that only duplications of entire j-j-c regions that possessed an enhancer-like element at their 3' end, and acquired at least one v segment at their 5' end, were selected and fixed as functional recombinational units.
