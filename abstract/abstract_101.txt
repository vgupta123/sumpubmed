BACKGROUND
cpg sites in an individual molecule may exist in a binary state  and each individual dna molecule, containing a certain number of cpgs, is a combination of these states defining an epihaplotype. classic quantification based approaches to study dna methylation are intrinsically unable to fully represent the complexity of the underlying methylation substrate. epihaplotype based approaches, on the other hand, allow methylation profiles of cell populations to be studied at the single molecule level.

for such investigations, next-generation sequencing techniques can be used, both for quantitative and for epihaplotype analysis. currently available tools for methylation analysis lack output formats that explicitly report cpg methylation profiles at the single molecule level and that have suited statistical tools for their interpretation.


RESULTS
here we present amplimethprofiler, a python-based pipeline for the extraction and statistical epihaplotype analysis of amplicons from targeted deep bisulfite sequencing of multiple dna regions.


CONCLUSIONS
amplimethprofiler tool provides an easy and user friendly way to extract and analyze the epihaplotype composition of reads from targeted bisulfite sequencing experiments. amplimethprofiler is written in python language and requires a local installation of blast and  qiime tools. it can be run on linux and os x platforms. the software is open source and freely available at http://amplimethprofiler.sourceforge.net.
