BACKGROUND
we consider the possibility of engineering metabolic pathways in a chassis organism in order to synthesize novel target compounds that are heterologous to the chassis. for this purpose, we model metabolic networks through hypergraphs where reactions are represented by hyperarcs. each hyperarc represents an enzyme-catalyzed reaction that transforms set of substrates compounds into product compounds. we follow a retrosynthetic approach in order to search in the metabolic space  for pathways  linking the target compounds to a source set of compounds.


RESULTS
to select the best pathways to engineer, we have developed an objective function that computes the cost of inserting a heterologous pathway in a given chassis organism. in order to find minimum-cost pathways, we propose in this paper two methods based on steady state analysis and network topology that are to the best of our knowledge, the first to enumerate all possible heterologous pathways linking a target compounds to a source set of compounds. in the context of metabolic engineering, the source set is composed of all naturally produced chassis compounds  and the target set can be any compound of the chemical space. we also provide an algorithm for identifying precursors which can be supplied to the growth media in order to increase the number of ways to synthesize specific target compounds.


CONCLUSIONS
we find the topological approach to be faster by several orders of magnitude than the steady state approach. yet both methods are generally scalable in time with the number of pathways in the metabolic network. therefore this work provides a powerful tool for pathway enumeration with direct application to biosynthetic pathway design.
