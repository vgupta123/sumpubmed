BACKGROUND
gut bifidobacteria are believed to influence immune-related diseases. the objective of this study was to assess the possible relationships between the gut bifidobacteria composition and coeliac disease  in children.

a total of  <dig> faecal samples  and  <dig> duodenal biopsy specimens of cd patients  were analysed. samples  from a control age-matched group of children were also included for comparative purposes. gut bifidobacterium genus and species were analyzed by real-time pcr.


RESULTS
active and non-active cd patients showed lower numbers of total bifidobacterium and b. longum species in faeces and duodenal biopsies than controls, and these differences were particularly remarkable between active cd patients and controls. b. catenulatum prevalence was higher in biopsies of controls than in those of active and non-active cd patients, whereas b. dentium prevalence was higher in faeces of non-active cd patients than in controls. correlations between levels of bifidobacterium and b. longum species in faecal and biopsy samples were detected in both cd patients and controls.


CONCLUSIONS
reductions in total bifidobacterium and b. longum populations were associated with both active and non-active cd when compared to controls. these bacterial groups could constitute novel targets for adjuvant dietary therapies although the confirmation of this hypothesis would require further investigations.
