BACKGROUND
the transition of epithelial cells from their normal non-motile state to a motile one requires the coordinated action of a number of small gtpases. we have previously shown that epithelial cell migration is stimulated by the coordinated activation of arf and rac gtpases. this crosstalk depends upon the assembly of a multi-protein complex that contains the arf-activating protein cytohesin 2/arno and the rac activating protein dock <dig>  two scaffolding proteins that bind directly to cytohesin  <dig> organize this complex.


RESULTS
we now have found that rac activation in response to hepatocyte growth factor  requires cytohesin  <dig> and dock <dig>  grasp/tamalin is one of the scaffolds that builds the complex containing cytohesin  <dig> and dock <dig>  we determine here that the ala/pro rich region of grasp directly interacts with the sh <dig> domain of dock <dig>  by binding to both cytohesin 2/arno and dock <dig>  grasp bridges the guanine nucleotide exchange factors  that activate arf and rac, thereby promoting arf-to-rac signaling. furthermore, we find that knockdown of grasp impairs hepatocyte growth factor -stimulated rac activation and hgf-stimulated epithelial migration.


CONCLUSIONS
grasp binds directly both cytohesin  <dig> and dock <dig> to coordinate their activities, and by doing so promotes crosstalk between arf and rac.
