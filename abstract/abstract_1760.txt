BACKGROUND
intrinsically disordered proteins, found in all living organisms, are essential for basic cellular functions and complement the function of ordered proteins. it has been shown that protein disorder is linked to the g + c content of the genome. furthermore, recent investigations have suggested that the evolutionary dynamics of the plant nucleus adds disordered segments to open reading frames alike, and these segments are not necessarily conserved among orthologous genes.


RESULTS
in the present work the distribution of intrinsically disordered proteins along the chromosomes of several representative plants was analyzed. the reported results support a non-random distribution of disordered proteins along the chromosomes of arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa, two model eudicot and monocot plant species, respectively. in fact, for most chromosomes positive correlations between the frequency of disordered segments of 30+ amino acids and both recombination rates and g + c content were observed.


CONCLUSIONS
these analyses demonstrate that the presence of disordered segments among plant proteins is associated with the rates of genetic recombination of their encoding genes. altogether, these findings suggest that high recombination rates, as well as chromosomal rearrangements, could induce disordered segments in proteins during evolution.
