BACKGROUND
the vitamin d <dig> receptor  is responsible for mediating the pleiotropic and, in part, cell-type-specific effects of  <dig> -dihydroxyvitamin d <dig>  on the cardiovascular and the muscle system, on the bone development and maintenance, mineral homeostasis, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, vitamin d metabolism, and immune response modulation.


RESULTS
based on data obtained from genome-wide yeast two-hybrid screenings, domain mapping studies, intracellular co-localization approaches as well as reporter transcription assay measurements, we show here that the c-terminus of human pim- <dig> kinase isoform <dig> , a serine/threonine kinase of the calcium/calmodulin-regulated kinase family, directly interacts with vdr through the receptorâ€™s dna-binding domain. we further demonstrate that pim- <dig> modulates calcitriol signaling in hacat keratinocytes by enhancing both endogenous calcitriol response gene transcription  and an extrachromosomal dr <dig> reporter response.


CONCLUSIONS
these results, taken together with previous reports of involvement of kinase pathways in vdr transactivation, underscore the biological relevance of this novel protein-protein interaction.
