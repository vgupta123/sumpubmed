BACKGROUND
recent advancements in next-generation sequencing technology have enabled cost-effective sequencing of whole or partial genomes, permitting the discovery and characterization of molecular polymorphisms. double-digest restriction-site associated dna sequencing  is a powerful and inexpensive approach to developing numerous single nucleotide polymorphism  markers and constructing a high-density genetic map. to enrich genomic resources for japanese eel , we constructed a ddrad-based genetic map using an ion torrent personal genome machine and anchored scaffolds of the current genome assembly to  <dig> linkage groups of the japanese eel. furthermore, we compared the japanese eel genome with genomes of model fishes to infer the history of genome evolution after the teleost-specific genome duplication.


RESULTS
we generated the ddrad-based linkage map of the japanese eel, where the maps for female and male spanned  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively, and were arranged into  <dig> linkage groups. a total of  <dig>  snp markers and  <dig> simple sequence repeat markers provide anchor points to  <dig>  scaffolds covering 151 mb  of the current genome assembly of the japanese eel. comparisons among the japanese eel, medaka, zebrafish and spotted gar genomes showed highly conserved synteny among teleosts and revealed part of the eight major chromosomal rearrangement events that occurred soon after the teleost-specific genome duplication.


CONCLUSIONS
the ddrad-seq approach combined with the ion torrent personal genome machine sequencing allowed us to conduct efficient and flexible snp genotyping. the integration of the genetic map and the assembled sequence provides a valuable resource for fine mapping and positional cloning of quantitative trait loci associated with economically important traits and for investigating comparative genomics of the japanese eel.
