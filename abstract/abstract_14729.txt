BACKGROUND
non-coding satellite dna  usually has a high turn-over rate frequently leading to species specific patterns. however, some satdna families evolve more slowly and can be found in several related species. here, we analyzed the mode of evolution of the pdo <dig> satdna family of dolichopoda cave crickets. in addition, we discuss the potential of slowly evolving satdnas as phylogenetic markers.


RESULTS
we sequenced  <dig> genomic or pcr amplified satdna repeats of the pdo <dig> family from  <dig> dolichopoda species. for the  <dig> populations under study,  <dig> pdo <dig> consensus sequences were deduced. phylogenetic analyses using bayesian, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood approaches yielded largely congruent tree topologies. the vast majority of pdo <dig> sequences grouped according to species designation. scatter plots and statistical tests revealed a significant correlation between genetic distances for satdna and mitochondrial dna. sliding window analyses showed species specific patterns of variable and conserved regions. the evolutionary rate of the pdo <dig> satdna was estimated to be  <dig> - <dig> % per lineage per million years.


CONCLUSIONS
the pdo <dig> satdna evolves gradually at a rate that is only slightly faster than previously published rates of insect mitochondrial coi sequences. the pdo <dig> phylogeny was basically congruent with the previously published mtdna phylogenies. accordingly, the slowly evolving pdo <dig> satdna family is indeed informative as a phylogenetic marker.
