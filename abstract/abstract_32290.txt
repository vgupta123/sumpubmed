BACKGROUND
congenital aniridia caused by heterozygousity at the pax <dig> locus is associated with ocular surface disease including keratopathy. it is not clear whether the keratopathy is a direct result of reduced pax <dig> gene dosage in the cornea itself, or due to recurrent corneal trauma secondary to defects such as dry eye caused by loss of pax <dig> in other tissues. we investigated the hypothesis that reducing pax <dig> gene dosage leads to corneal wound-healing defects. and assayed the immediate molecular responses to wounding in wild-type and mutant corneal epithelial cells.


RESULTS
pax6+/- mouse corneal epithelia exhibited a 2-hour delay in their response to wounding, but subsequently the cells migrated normally to repair the wound. both pax6+/+ and pax6+/- epithelia activated immediate wound-induced waves of intracellular calcium signaling. however, the intensity and speed of propagation of the calcium wave, mediated by release from intracellular stores, was reduced in pax6+/- cells. initiation and propagation of the calcium wave could be largely decoupled, and both phases of the calcium wave responses were required for wound healing. wounded cells phosphorylated the extracellular signal-related kinases 1/ <dig> . erk1/ <dig> activation was shown to be required for rapid initiation of wound healing, but had only a minor effect on the rate of cell migration in a healing epithelial sheet. addition of exogenous epidermal growth factor  to wounded pax6+/- cells restored the calcium wave, increased erk1/ <dig> activation and restored the immediate healing response to wild-type levels.


CONCLUSIONS
the study links pax <dig> deficiency to a previously overlooked wound-healing delay. it demonstrates that defective calcium signaling in pax6+/- cells underlies this delay, and shows that it can be pharmacologically corrected. erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation is required for the rapid initiation of wound healing. a model is presented whereby minor abrasions, which are quickly healed in normal corneas, transiently persist in aniridic patients, compromising the corneal stroma.
