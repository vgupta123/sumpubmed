BACKGROUND
natural killer t cells represent a linkage between innate and adaptive immunity. they are a heterogeneous population of specialized t lymphocytes composed of different subsets. dx5+nkt cells are characterized by expression of the nk cell marker dx <dig> in the context of cd <dig>  however, little is known about the phenotype and functional capacity of this unique cell population. therefore, we investigated the expression of several t cell and nk cell markers, as well as functional parameters in spleen and liver subsets of dx5+nkt cells in nk <dig> - balb/c mice and compared our findings to nk <dig> + c57bl/ <dig> mice.


RESULTS
in the spleen 34% of dx5+nkt cells expressed cd62l and they up-regulated the functional receptors cd <dig> as well as cd <dig> upon activation. in contrast, only a few liver dx5+nkt cells expressed cd62l, and they did not up-regulate cd <dig> upon activation. a further difference between spleen and liver subsets was observed in cytokine production. spleen dx5+nkt cells produced more th <dig> cytokines including il- <dig>  ifn-γ and tnf-α, while liver dx5+nkt cells secreted more th <dig> cytokines  and even the th <dig> cytokine, il-17a. furthermore, we found inter-strain differences. in nk <dig> + c57bl/ <dig> mice dx5+nkt cells represented a distinct t cell population expressing less cd <dig> and more cd <dig>  accordingly, these cells showed a cd <dig> and th2-type functional capacity upon activation.


CONCLUSIONS
these results show that dx5+nkt cells are a heterogeneous population, depending on the dedicated organ and mouse strain, that has diverse functional capacity.
