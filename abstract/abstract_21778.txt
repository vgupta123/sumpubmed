BACKGROUND

actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the etiological agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, which leads to large economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. in this study, s-8△clpp△apxiic, a double-deletion mutant of a. pleuropneumoniae was constructed, and its safety and protective efficacy were evaluated in pigs.


RESULTS
the s-8△clpp△apxiic mutant exhibited attenuated virulence in a murine  model, and caused no detrimental effects on pigs even at a dose of up to  <dig>  × 109 cfu. furthermore, the s-8△clpp△apxiic mutant was able to induce a strong immune response in pigs, which included high levels of igg <dig> and igg <dig>  stimulated gamma interferon , interleukin  <dig> , and interleukin  <dig>  production, and conferred effective protection against the lethal challenge with a. pleuropneumoniae serovars  <dig> or 5a. the pigs in the s-8△clpp△apxiic immunized groups have no lesions and reduced bacterial loads in the lung tissue after challenge.


CONCLUSIONS
the data obtained in this study suggest that the s-8△clpp△apxiic mutant can serve as a highly immunogenic and potential live attenuated vaccine candidate against a. pleuropneumoniae infection.
