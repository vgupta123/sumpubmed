BACKGROUND
general iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis proceeds through assembly of a transient cluster on iscu followed by its transfer to a recipient apo-protein. the efficiency of the second step is increased by the presence of hsca and hscb, but the reason behind this is poorly understood. to shed light on the function of hscb, we began a study on the nature of its interaction with iscu. our work suggested that the binding site of iscu is in the c-terminal domain of hscb, and two different triple alanine substitutions  involving predicted binding site residues had detrimental effects on this interaction. however, the individual contribution of each substitution to the observed effect remains to be determined as well as the possible involvement of other residues in the proposed binding site.


RESULTS
in the work reported here, we used isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize the affinity of single alanine hscb mutants for iscu, and subsequently confirmed our results with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. alanine substitutions of l <dig>  l <dig>  and f <dig> severely impaired the ability of hscb to form a complex with iscu; substitutions of r <dig>  r <dig>  and e <dig> had more modest effects; and substitutions of t <dig>  m <dig>  e <dig>  d <dig>  e <dig>  r <dig>  k <dig>  and s <dig> had only minor or no detectable effects.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the residues of hscb most important for strong interaction with iscu include three hydrophobic residues ; in addition, we identified a number of other residues whose side chains contribute to a lesser extent to the interaction. our results suggest that the triple alanine substitution at hscb positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> will destabilize the hscb-iscu complex by ΔΔgb≅  <dig>  kcal/mol, equivalent to a ≅ 15000-fold reduction in the affinity of hscb for iscu. we propose that this triple mutant could provide a more definitive test of the functional importance of the hscb-iscu interaction in vivo than those used previously that yielded inconclusive results.
