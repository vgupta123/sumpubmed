BACKGROUND
plants are natural products that humans consume in various ways including food and medicine. they have a long empirical history of treating diseases with relatively few side effects. based on these strengths, many studies have been performed to verify the effectiveness of plants in treating diseases. it is crucial to understand the chemicals contained in plants because these chemicals can regulate activities of proteins that are key factors in causing diseases. with the accumulation of a large volume of biomedical literature in various databases such as pubmed, it is possible to automatically extract relationships between plants and chemicals in a large-scale way if we apply a text mining approach. a cornerstone of achieving this task is a corpus of relationships between plants and chemicals.


RESULTS
in this study, we first constructed a corpus for plant and chemical entities and for the relationships between them. the corpus contains  <dig> plant entities,  <dig> chemical entities, and  <dig>  plant–chemical relationships , which are drawn from  <dig> sentences in  <dig> pubmed abstracts. inter-annotator agreement scores for the corpus among three annotators were measured. the simple percent agreement scores for entities and trigger words for the relationships were  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, and the overall kappa score for the classification of positive and negative relationships was  <dig>  %. we also developed a rule-based model to automatically extract such plant–chemical relationships. when we evaluated the rule-based model using the corpus and randomly selected biomedical articles, overall f-scores of  <dig>  and  <dig>  % were achieved, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
we expect that the corpus for plant–chemical relationships will be a useful resource for enhancing plant research. the corpus is available at http://combio.gist.ac.kr/plantchemicalcorpus.
