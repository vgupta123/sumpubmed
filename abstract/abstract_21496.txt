BACKGROUND
the endosteum of the bone marrow provides a specialized hypoxic niche that may serve to preserve the integrity, pluripotency, longevity and stemness of resident mesenchymal stem cells . to explore the molecular genetic consequences of such a niche we subjected human  mscs to a po <dig> of 4Â mmhg and analyzed global gene expression and alternative splicing  by genome-exon microarray and rt-qpcr, and phenotype by western blot and immunostaining.


RESULTS
out of  <dig> genes differentially regulated by > <dig> -fold, down-regulated genes outnumbered up-regulated genes by 243: <dig>  exon analyses revealed  <dig> hypoxia-regulated as events with splice indices  > <dig>  from  <dig> genes and a correlation between high si and degree of transcript regulation. parallel analyses of a publicly available as study on human umbilical vein endothelial cells  showed that there was a strong cell-specific component with only  <dig> genes commonly regulated in hmscs and huvecs and  <dig> common differentially spliced genes. only  <dig> genes were differentially responsive to hypoxia at the gene  and as levels in both cell types. functional assignments revealed unique profiles of gene expression with complex regulation of differentiation, extracellular matrix, intermediate filament and metabolic marker genes. antioxidant genes, striated muscle genes and insulin/igf- <dig> signaling intermediates were down-regulated. there was a coordinate induction of  <dig> out of  <dig> acidic keratins that along with other epithelial and cell adhesion markers implies a partial mesenchymal to epithelial transition.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that severe hypoxia confers a quiescent phenotype in hmscs that is reflected by both the transcriptome profile and gene-specific changes of splicosome actions. the results reveal that severe hypoxia imposes markedly different patterns of gene regulation of mscs compared with more moderate hypoxia. this is the first study to report hypoxia-regulation of as in stem/progenitor cells and the first molecular genetic characterization of msc in a hypoxia-induced quiescent immobile state.
