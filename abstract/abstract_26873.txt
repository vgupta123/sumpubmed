BACKGROUND
pigmentation patterns are one of the most recognizable phenotypes across the animal kingdom. they play an important role in camouflage, communication, mate recognition and mate choice. most progress on understanding the genetics of pigmentation has been achieved via mutational analysis, with relatively little work done to understand variation in natural populations. pigment patterns vary dramatically among species of cichlid fish from lake malawi, and are thought to be important in speciation. in this study, we crossed two species, metriaclima zebra and m. mbenjii, that differ in several aspects of their body and fin color. we genotyped  <dig> snps in 160 f <dig> male individuals to construct a linkage map that was used to identify quantitative trait loci  associated with the pigmentation traits of interest. we also used the linkage map to anchor portions of the m. zebra genome assembly.


RESULTS
we constructed a linkage map consisting of  <dig> markers in  <dig> linkage groups that spanned over  <dig>  cm. qtl analysis detected one qtl each for dorsal fin xanthophores, caudal fin xanthophores, and pelvic fin melanophores. dorsal fin and caudal fin xanthophores share a qtl on lg <dig>  while pelvic fin melanophores have a qtl on lg <dig>  we used the mapped markers to anchor  <dig> % of the m. zebra genome assembly. within each qtl interval we identified several candidate genes that might play a role in pigment cell development.


CONCLUSIONS
this is one of a few studies to identify qtl for natural variation in fish pigmentation. the qtl intervals we identified did not contain any pigmentation genes previously identified by mutagenesis studies in other species. we expect that further work on these intervals will identify new genes involved in pigment cell development in natural populations.
