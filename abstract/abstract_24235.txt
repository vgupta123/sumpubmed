BACKGROUND
transferrin binding protein b , an outer membrane lipoprotein, is required for the acquisition of iron from human transferrin. two tbpb families have been documented in neisseria meningitidis: an isotype i tbpb gene of  <dig>  kb and an isotype ii tbpb gene of  <dig>  kb, the former expressed by meningococci in the disease-associated st- <dig> clonal complex and the latter found among meningococci belonging to the hyper-invasive clonal complexes including st- <dig>  st- <dig>  st- <dig>  st-41/ <dig> as well as n. gonorrhoeae isolates. the origin of the isotype i tbpb gene is unknown, however several features in common with non-pathogenic neisseria and the st- <dig> clonal complex n. meningitidis isolate fam <dig> have been documented leading to the hypothesis that the isotype i tbpb gene may also be shared between non-pathogenic neisseria and st- <dig> meningococci. as a result, the diversity of the tbpb gene was investigated in a defined collection of neisseria species.


RESULTS
two families of isotype i tbpb were identified: family a containing conserved genes belonging to st- <dig> meningococci, n. polysaccharea and n. lactamica isolates and family b including more diverse isotype i tbpb genes from n. sicca, n. mucosa, n. flava, n. subflava as well as n. cinerea, n. flavescens and n. polysaccharea isolates. three isotype ii tbpb families were identified with: family c containing diverse tbpb genes belonging to n. polysaccharea, n. lactamica, n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis isolates, family d including another subset of isotype ii tbpb genes from n. lactamica isolates and family e solely composed of n. gonorrhoeae tbpb genes.


CONCLUSIONS
this study reveals another instance of similarity between meningococci of the st- <dig> clonal complex and non-pathogenic neisseria with the origin of the isotype i tbpb gene resulting from a horizontal genetic transfer event occurring between these two populations.
