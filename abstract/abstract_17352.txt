BACKGROUND
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease  is associated with a high risk for liver cirrhosis and cancer. recent studies demonstrate that nafld significantly impacts on the genome wide methylation and expression reporting top hit genes to be associated with e.g. diabetes mellitus. in a targeted analysis we specifically investigate to what extent nafld is associated with methylation and transcriptional changes in gene networks responsible for drug metabolism  and bile acid  homeostasis, which may trigger liver and system toxic events.

methods
we performed a systematic analysis of  <dig> genes responsible for ba homeostasis and dm based on liver derived methylation and expression data from three cohort studies including  <dig> nafld and  <dig> non-nafld patients. using multiple linear regression models, we detected methylation differences in proximity to the transcriptional start site of these genes in two nafld cohorts and correlated the methylation of significantly changed cpg sites to transcriptional expression in a third cohort using robust multiple linear regression approaches.


RESULTS
we detected  <dig> genes involved in ba homeostasis and dm to be significantly differentially methylated. in  <dig> of these genes, methylation significantly correlated with rna expression, detecting i.e. genes such as cyp27a <dig>  ostɑ, and slc27a <dig> , and slco2b <dig>  slc47a <dig>  and several ugt and cyp genes  to be nafld dependently modulated.


CONCLUSIONS
nafld is associated with significant shifts in the methylation of key genes responsible for ba and dm that are associated with transcriptional modulations. these findings have implications for ba composition, ba regulated metabolic pathways and for drug safety and efficacy.
