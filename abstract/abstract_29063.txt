BACKGROUND
polycomb repressive complex  <dig> -catalyzed h3k27me <dig> marks are tightly associated with the wus-ag negative feedback loop to terminate floral stem cell fate to promote carpel development, but the roles of polycomb repressive complex  <dig>  in this event remain largely uncharacterized.


RESULTS
here we show conspicuous variability in the morphology and number of carpels among individual flowers in the absence of the prc <dig> core components atring1a and atring1b, which contrasts with the wild-type floral meristem consumed by uniform carpel production in arabidopsis thaliana. promoter-driven gus reporter analysis showed that atring1a and atring1b display a largely similar expression pattern, except in the case of the exclusively maternal-preferred expression of atring1b, but not atring1a, in the endosperm. indeterminate carpel development in the atring1a;atring1b double mutant is due to replum/ovule-to-carpel conversion in association with ectopic expression of class i knox  genes. moreover, atring1a and atring1b also play a critical role in ovule development, mainly through promoting the degeneration of non-functional megaspores and proper integument formation. genetic interaction analysis indicates that the atring1a/b-regulated knox-i pathway acts largely in a complementary manner with the wus-ag pathway in controlling floral stem cell maintenance and proper carpel development.


CONCLUSIONS
our study uncovers a novel mechanistic pathway through which atring1a and atring1b repress knox-i expression to terminate floral stem cell activities and establish carpel cell fate identities.
