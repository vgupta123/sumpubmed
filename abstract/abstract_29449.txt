BACKGROUND
clostridium beijerinckii is a valuable bacteria species which has the ability of abe  production. it has been shown that phosphotransferase  is an important and common system for both carbohydrate uptake and phosphorylation in bacteria, but detailed study of the system, especially its fructose/mannose/sorbose family is scant.


RESULTS
in the genome of clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig>  a model strain recently sequenced, there are large number of pts genes, among them  <dig> complete sets belong to the fructose/mannose/sorbose family of its enzyme ii complex. our study, based on evidences provided by phylogenetic relationship, analyses of gene contents and clusters, as well as synteny examination, indicates that it is possible to further classify this pts family into three sub-groups, which are corresponding to the three sugar substrates. furthermore, we proposed a model how these pts systems are evolved in bacteria.


CONCLUSIONS
this work may explain the experimental result that clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> can better utilize fructose as substrate, thus could lead to a better understanding of the abe-producing mechanism in clostridium beijerinckii and other microbial species. it may help to illustrate a higher butanol-productivity future.
