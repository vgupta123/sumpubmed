BACKGROUND
the human fungal pathogen candida albicans is able to undergo morphogenesis from a yeast to a hyphal growth form. protein kinase a  isoforms tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> promote hyphal growth in a signalling pathway via the transcription factor efg <dig> 


RESULTS
c. albicans strains producing epitope-tagged tpk <dig> or tpk <dig> were used in genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation on chip  to reveal genomic binding sites. during yeast growth, both pka isoforms were situated primarily within orfs but moved to promoter regions shortly after hyphal induction. binding sequences for tpk <dig> greatly exceeded tpk <dig> sites and did not coincide with binding of the pka regulatory subunit bcy <dig>  consensus binding sequences for tpk <dig> within orfs included accac and cagca motifs that appeared to bias codon usage within the binding regions. promoter residency of tpk <dig> correlated with the transcript level of the corresponding gene during hyphal morphogenesis and occurred near efg <dig> binding sites, mainly on genes encoding regulators of morphogenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
pka isoforms change their genomic binding sites from orf to promoter regions during yeast-hyphal morphogenesis. tpk <dig> binds preferentially to promoters of genes encoding regulators of cellular morphogenesis.
