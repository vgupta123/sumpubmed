BACKGROUND
tef  is the major cereal crop in ethiopia. tef is an allotetraploid with a base chromosome number of  <dig>  and a genome size of  <dig> mbp. the goal of this study was to identify agronomically important quantitative trait loci  using recombinant inbred lines  derived from an inter-specific cross between e. tef and e. pilosa .


RESULTS
twenty-two yield-related and morphological traits were assessed across eight different locations in ethiopia during the growing seasons of  <dig> and  <dig>  using composite interval mapping and a linkage map incorporating  <dig> loci,  <dig> qtls were identified on  <dig> of the  <dig> linkage groups for  <dig> traits. twelve qtls on nine linkage groups were identified for grain yield. clusters of more than five qtls for various traits were identified on seven linkage groups. the largest cluster  was identified on linkage group 8; eight of these qtls were for yield or yield components, suggesting linkage or pleotrophic effects of loci. there were  <dig> two-way interactions of loci to detect potential epistasis identified and 75% of the interactions were derived from yield and shoot biomass. thirty-one percent of the qtls were observed in multiple environments; two yield qtls were consistent across all agro-ecology zones. for  <dig> % of the qtls, the alleles from e. pilosa  had a beneficial effect.


CONCLUSIONS
the extensive qtl data generated for tef in this study will provide a basis for initiating molecular breeding to improve agronomic traits in this staple food crop for the people of ethiopia.
