BACKGROUND
the analysis of viral vector genomic integration sites is an important component in assessing the safety and efficiency of patient treatment using gene therapy. alongside this clinical application, integration site identification is a key step in the genetic mapping of viral elements in mutagenesis screens that aim to elucidate gene function.


RESULTS
we have developed a unix-based vector integration site analysis pipeline  that utilises a unix-based workflow for automated integration site identification and annotation of both single and paired-end sequencing reads. reads that contain viral sequences of interest are selected and aligned to the host genome, and unique integration sites are then classified as transcription start site-proximal, intragenic or intergenic.


CONCLUSIONS
ub-isap provides a reliable and efficient pipeline to generate large datasets for assessing the safety and efficiency of integrating vectors in clinical settings, with broader applications in cancer research. ub-isap is available as an open source software package at https://sourceforge.net/projects/ub-isap/.
