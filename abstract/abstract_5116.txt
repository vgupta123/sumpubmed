BACKGROUND
chromatin dynamics and stability are both required to control normal development of multicellular organisms. chromatin assembly factor caf- <dig> is a histone chaperone that facilitates chromatin formation and the maintenance of specific chromatin states. in plants and animals caf- <dig> is essential for normal development, but it is poorly understood which developmental pathways require caf- <dig> function.


RESULTS
mutations in all three caf- <dig> subunits affect arabidopsis trichome morphology and lack of caf- <dig> function results in formation of trichomes with supernumerary branches. this phenotype can be partially alleviated by external sucrose. in contrast, other aspects of the caf- <dig> mutant phenotype, such as defective meristem function and organ formation, are aggravated by external sucrose. double mutant analyses revealed epistatic interactions between caf- <dig> mutants and stichel, but non-epistatic interactions between caf- <dig> mutants and glabra <dig> and kaktus. in addition, mutations in caf- <dig> could partly suppress the strong overbranching and polyploidization phenotype of kaktus mutants.


CONCLUSIONS
caf- <dig> is required for cell differentiation and regulates trichome development together with stichel in an endoreduplication-independent pathway. this function of caf- <dig> can be partially substituted by application of exogenous sucrose. finally, caf- <dig> is also needed for the high degree of endoreduplication in kaktus mutants and thus for the realization of kaktus' extreme overbranching phenotype.
