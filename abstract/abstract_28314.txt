BACKGROUND
a study to evaluate the biofilm-development ability in three different media  was performed with  <dig> collection strains from  <dig> different species on non-pigmented rapidly growing mycobacteria . a microtiter plate assay was developed to evaluate the percentage of covered surface of the microtiter plate wells in different days from day  <dig> to day  <dig> 


RESULTS
all strains were able to develop biofilm in all the tested media. middlebrook 7h <dig> showed the fastest growth, followed by sterile tap water and pbs-5% glucose. a sigmoid growth curve was detected in all the strains both in middlebrook 7h <dig> and in sterile tap water. a difference could be detected for mycobacterium abscessus in tap water, where it showed faster growth than all the other strains.


CONCLUSIONS
biofilm development seems to be a property of all the species of nprgm and it depends on the nutrients present in the medium. the microtiter plate assay described here is a useful tool to evaluate differences in biofilm development among the different species of rapidly growing mycobacteria.
