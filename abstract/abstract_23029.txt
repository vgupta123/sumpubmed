BACKGROUND
prediction of long-range inter-residue contacts is an important topic in bioinformatics research. it is helpful for determining protein structures, understanding protein foldings, and therefore advancing the annotation of protein functions.


RESULTS
in this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of genetic algorithm classifiers  to address the long-range contact prediction problem. our method is based on the key idea called sequence profile centers . each spc is the average sequence profiles of residue pairs belonging to the same contact class or non-contact class. gacs train on multiple but different pairs of long-range contact data  and long-range non-contact data . the negative data sets, having roughly the same sizes as the positive ones, are constructed by random sampling over the original imbalanced negative data. as a result, about  <dig> % long-range contacts are correctly predicted. we also found that the ensemble of gacs indeed makes an accuracy improvement by around  <dig> % over the single gac.


CONCLUSIONS
classifiers with the use of sequence profile centers may advance the long-range contact prediction. in line with this approach, key structural features in proteins would be determined with high efficiency and accuracy.
