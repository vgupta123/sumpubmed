BACKGROUND
pseudoautosomal regions  in eutherians retain homologous regions between the x and y chromosomes that play a critical role in the obligatory x-y crossover during male meiosis. genes that reside in the par <dig> are exceptional in that they are rich in repetitive sequences and undergo a very high rate of recombination. remarkably, murine par <dig> homologs have translocated to various autosomes, reflecting the complex recombination history during the evolution of the mammalian x chromosome.


RESULTS
we now report that the snf2-type chromatin remodeling protein atrx controls the expression of eutherian ancestral par <dig> genes that have translocated to autosomes in the mouse. in addition, we have identified two potentially novel mouse par <dig> orthologs.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that the ancestral par <dig> genes share a common epigenetic environment that allows atrx to control their expression.
