BACKGROUND
the amygdala plays an essential role in controlling emotional behaviors and has numerous connections to other brain regions. the functional role of the amygdala has been highlighted by various studies of stress-induced behavioral changes. here we investigated gene expression changes in the amygdala in the chronic immobilization stress -induced depression model.


RESULTS
eight genes were decreased in the amygdala of cis mice, including genes for neurotrophic factors and extracellular matrix proteins. among these, osteoglycin, fibromodulin, insulin-like growth factor  <dig> , and insulin-like growth factor binding protein  <dig>  were further analyzed for histological expression changes. the expression of osteoglycin and fibromodulin simultaneously decreased in the medial, basolateral, and central amygdala regions. however, igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> decreased specifically in the central nucleus of the amygdala. interestingly, this decrease was found only in the amygdala of mice showing higher immobility, but not in mice displaying lower immobility, although the cis regimen was the same for both groups.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that the responsiveness of the amygdala may play a role in the sensitivity of cis-induced behavioral changes in mice.
