BACKGROUND
botrytis cinerea is a phytopathogenic fungus responsible for the disease known as gray mold, which causes substantial losses of fruits at postharvest. this fungus is present often as latent infection and an apparently healthy fruit can deteriorate suddenly due to the development of this infection. for this reason, rapid and sensitive methods are necessary for its detection and quantification. this article describes the development of an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  for quantification of b. cinerea in apple , table grape , and pear  tissues.


RESULTS
the method was based in the competition for the binding site of monoclonal antibodies between b. cinerea antigens present in fruit tissues and b. cinerea purified antigens immobilized by a crosslinking agent onto the surface of the microtiter plates. the method was validated considering parameters such as selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy and sensibility. the calculated detection limit was  <dig>  Î¼g ml- <dig> b. cinerea antigens. the immobilized antigen was perfectly stable for at least  <dig> months assuring the reproducibility of the assay. the fungus was detected and quantified in any of the fruits tested when the rot was not visible yet. results were compared with a dna quantification method and these studies showed good correlation.


CONCLUSIONS
the developed method allowed detects the presence of b. cinerea in asymptomatic fruits and provides the advantages of low cost, easy operation, and short analysis time determination for its possible application in the phytosanitary programs of the fruit industry worldwide.
