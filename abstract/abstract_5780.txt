BACKGROUND
recognizing the correct structural fold among known template protein structures for a target protein  is essential for template-based protein structure modeling. since the fold recognition problem can be defined as a binary classification problem of predicting whether or not the unknown fold of a target protein is similar to an already known template protein structure in a library, machine learning methods have been effectively applied to tackle this problem. in our work, we developed rf-fold that uses random forest - one of the most powerful and scalable machine learning classification methods - to recognize protein folds.


RESULTS
rf-fold consists of hundreds of decision trees that can be trained efficiently on very large datasets to make accurate predictions on a highly imbalanced dataset. we evaluated rf-fold on the standard lindahl's benchmark dataset comprised of  <dig> Ã—  <dig> target-template protein pairs through cross-validation. compared with  <dig> different fold recognition methods, the performance of rf-fold is generally comparable to the best performance in fold recognition of different difficulty ranging from the easiest family level, the medium-hard superfamily level, and to the hardest fold level. based on the top-one template protein ranked by rf-fold, the correct recognition rate is  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % at family, superfamily, and fold levels, respectively. based on the top-five template protein folds ranked by rf-fold, the correct recognition rate increases to  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % at family, superfamily, and fold levels.


CONCLUSIONS
the good performance achieved by the rf-fold demonstrates the random forest's effectiveness for protein fold recognition.
