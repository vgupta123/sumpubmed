BACKGROUND
cell panning of phage-displayed antibody library is a powerful tool for the development of therapeutic and imaging agents since disease-related cell surface proteins in native complex conformation can be directly targeted. here, we employed a strategy taking advantage of an integrated vector system which allows rapid conversion of scfv-displaying phage into scfv-fc format for efficient cell-based scfv library selection on a tetraspanin protein, cd <dig> 


RESULTS
a mouse scfv library constructed by using a phagemid vector, pdr-d <dig> was subjected to cell panning against stable cd <dig> transfectant, and the scfv repertoire from the enriched phage pool was directly transferred to a mammalian cassette vector, pdr-orip-fc <dig>  the resulting constructs enabled transient expression of enough amounts of scfv-fcs in hek293e cells, and flow cytometric screening of binders for cd <dig> transfectant could be performed simply by using the culture supernatants. all three clones selected from the screening showed correct cd9-specificity. they could immunoprecipitate cd <dig> molecules out of the transfectant cell lysate and correctly stain endogenous cd <dig> expression on cancer cell membrane. furthermore, competition assay with a known anti-cd <dig> monoclonal antibody  suggested that the binding epitopes of some of them overlap with that of the mab which resides within the large extracellular loop of cd <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that scfv-fc from mammalian transient expression can be chosen as a reliable format for rapid screening and validation in cell-based scfv library selection, and the strategy described here will be applicable to efficient discovery of antibodies to diverse cell-surface targets.
