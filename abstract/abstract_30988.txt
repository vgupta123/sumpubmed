BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus  is a major nosocomial pathogen that causes a variety of infections and toxicoses. in recent years, the percentage of rifampicin-resistant s. aureus has increased rapidly in china. the aims of this study were to analyze 1) the level of rifampicin resistance in s. aureus and its correlation with mutations in the rpob gene, and 2) the molecular characterization of rifampicin-resistant s. aureus isolates.


RESULTS
 <dig> rifampicin-resistant s. aureus isolates were collected for this study. of the  <dig> isolates,  <dig>  were high-level rifampicin resistant  while the remaining  <dig> isolates  had a low-level resistance to rifampicin . four amino acid substitutions were found in the  <dig> isolates, which were 481his/asn , 466leu/ser , 477ala/asp  and 486ser/leu  respectively. all mutations were found to be present in cluster i of the rpob gene. the low-level resistant isolates were found to have only one mutation, while the high-level resistant isolates had at least two or more mutations. the most common multiple mutations were 481his/asn+466leu/ser. the other multiple mutations found were 481his/asn+477ala/asp , and 481his/asn+466leu/ser+477ala/asp . out of  <dig> high-level rifampicin-resistant s. aureus isolates, three molecular types were found, namely, st239-mrsa-iii-spa t <dig> , st239-mrsa-iii-spa t <dig> , and st239-mrsa-iii-spa t <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
rifampicin resistance in s. aureus was closely associated with mutations in the rpob gene. high-level rifampicin-resistant s. aureus is one of the most important features in anhui provincial hospital, and high-level rifampicin resistance in s. aureus is associated with multiple mutations of rpob gene. the prevalence of high-level rifampicin-resistant s. aureus in anhui may be associated with the spread of the st239-mrsa iii-spa t <dig> clone.
