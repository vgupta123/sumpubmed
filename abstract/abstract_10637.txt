BACKGROUND
histone modifications have been implicated in the regulation of transcription and, more recently, in dna replication and repair. in yeast, a major conserved histone acetyltransferase, hat1p, preferentially acetylates lysine residues  <dig> and  <dig> on histone h <dig> 


RESULTS
here, we report that a nuclear sub-complex consisting of hat1p and its partner hat2p interacts physically and functionally with the origin recognition complex . while mutational inactivation of the histone acetyltransferase  gene hat <dig> alone does not compromise origin firing or initiation of dna replication, a deletion in hat <dig>  exacerbates the growth defects of conditional orc-ts mutants. thus, the orc-associated hat1p-dependent histone acetyltransferase activity suggests a novel linkage between histone modification and dna replication. additional genetic and biochemical evidence points to the existence of partly overlapping histone h <dig> acetyltransferase activities in addition to hat1p/hat2p for proper dna replication efficiency. furthermore, we demonstrated a dynamic association of hat1p with chromatin during s-phase that suggests a role of this enzyme at the replication fork.


CONCLUSIONS
we have found an intriguing new association of the hat1p-dependent histone acetyltransferase in addition to its previously known role in nuclear chromatin assembly . the participation of a distinct hat1p/hat2p sub-complex suggests a linkage of histone h <dig> modification with orc-dependent dna replication.
