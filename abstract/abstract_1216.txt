BACKGROUND
the effect of digoxin administration on the serum concentration of the cardiac troponin i  has not been reported to date in equidae. this study was therefore designed to evaluate the effect of digoxin on cardiac cell damage in donkeys  as assessed by ctni, acid–base and electrolyte balance and haematobiochemical profiles. ten clinically healthy donkeys were given an iv infusion of digoxin at a dose of 14 μg/kg. blood samples were collected from the donkeys up through 72 h post-injection.


RESULTS
three of the donkeys exhibited increased heart and respiratory rates post-injection. in the other seven animals, the heart and respiratory rates were lower 4 h post-injection. the serum digoxin concentration increased significantly at many time points after injection. the serum concentration of ctni did not differ significantly between pre- and post-injection. an increase in blood ph was noted at 3 h after digoxin injection. there were also increases in po <dig> and in oxygen saturation. decreases in pco <dig> at  <dig> to 48 h post-injection as well as a decrease in blood lactate at 4 h post-injection were observed. the serum concentration of glucose remained significantly elevated at all-time points after digoxin injection.


CONCLUSIONS
it is concluded that administration of digoxin to healthy donkeys  did not result in elevations of serum ctni concentration, signs of digoxin intoxication, ecg abnormalities and did not increase serum concentrations of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine.
