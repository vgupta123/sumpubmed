BACKGROUND
upstream open reading frames  can down-regulate the translation of the main open reading frame  through two broad mechanisms: ribosomal stalling and reducing reinitiation efficiency. in distantly related plants, such as rice and arabidopsis, it has been found that conserved uorfs are rare in these transcriptomes with approximately  <dig> loci. it is unclear how prevalent conserved uorfs are in closely related plants.


RESULTS
we used a homology-based approach to identify conserved uorfs in five cereals  that could potentially regulate translation. our approach used a modified reciprocal best hit method to identify putative orthologous sequences that were then analysed by a comparative r-nomics program called uorfscan to find conserved uorfs.


CONCLUSIONS
this research identified new genes that may be controlled at the level of translation by conserved uorfs. we report that conserved uorfs are rare  in cereal transcriptomes, are generally short , highly conserved , position independent in their 5'-utrs, and their start codon context and the usage of rare codons for translation does not appear to be important.
