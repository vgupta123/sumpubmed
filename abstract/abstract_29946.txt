BACKGROUND
adhesion to extracellular matrix  components has been implicated in the proliferative and invasive properties of tumor cells. we investigated the ability of c <dig> glioma cells to attach to ecm components in vitro and described the regulatory role of glycosaminoglycans  on their adhesion to the substrate, proliferation and migration.


RESULTS
ecm proteins  stimulate rat c <dig> glioma cell line adhesion in vitro, in a dose-dependent manner. the higher adhesion values were achieved with type iv collagen. exogenous heparin or chondroitin sulfate impaired, in a dose-dependent manner the attachment of c <dig> glioma cell line to laminin and fibronectin, but not to type iv collagen. dextran sulfate did not affect c <dig> adhesion to any ecm protein analyzed, indicating a specific role of gags in mediating glioma adhesion to laminin and fibronectin. gags and dextran sulfate did not induce c <dig> glioma detachment from any tested substrate suggesting specific effect in the initial step of cell adhesion. furthermore, heparin and chondroitin sulfate impaired c <dig> cells proliferation on fibronectin, but not on type iv collagen or laminin. in contrast, both gags stimulate the glioma migration on laminin without effect on type iv collagen or fibronectin.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that gags and proteoglycans regulate glioma cell adhesion to ecm proteins in specific manner leading to cell proliferation or cell migration, according to the ecm composition, thus modulating tumor cell properties.
