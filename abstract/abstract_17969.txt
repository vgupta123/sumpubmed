BACKGROUND
it is clear that the coordinated and reciprocal actions of kinases and phosphatases are fundamental in the regulation of development and growth of the malaria parasite. protein phosphatase type  <dig> is a key enzyme playing diverse and essential roles in cell survival. its dephosphorylation activity/specificity is governed by the interaction of its catalytic subunit  with regulatory proteins. among these, inhibitor- <dig>  is one of the most evolutionarily ancient pp <dig> regulators. in vivo studies in various organisms revealed a defect in chromosome segregation and cell cycle progression when the function of i <dig> is blocked.


RESULTS
in this report, we present evidence that plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most deadly form of malaria, expresses a structural homolog of mammalian i <dig>  named pfi <dig>  biochemical, in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that pfi <dig> binds pp <dig> and inhibits its activity. we further showed that the motifs 12ktisw <dig> and 102hyne <dig> are critical for pfi <dig> inhibitory activity. functional studies using the xenopus oocyte model revealed that pfi <dig> is able to overcome the g2/m cell cycle checkpoint by inducing germinal vesicle breakdown. genetic manipulations in p. falciparum suggest an essential role of pfi <dig> as no viable mutants with a disrupted pfi <dig> gene were detectable. additionally, peptides derived from pfi <dig> and competing with rvxf binding sites in pp <dig> exhibit anti-plasmodial activity against blood stage parasites in vitro.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data suggest that the pfi <dig> protein could play a role in the regulation of the p. falciparum cell cycle through its pfpp <dig> phosphatase regulatory activity. structure-activity studies of this regulator led to the identification of peptides with anti-plasmodial activity against blood stage parasites in vitro suggesting that pp1c-regulator interactions could be a novel means to control malaria.
