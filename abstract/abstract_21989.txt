BACKGROUND
microsatellites are ubiquitous in genomes of various organisms. with the realization that they play roles in developmental and physiological processes, rather than exist as ‘junk’ dna, microsatellites are receiving increasing attention. next-generation sequencing allows acquisition of large-scale microsatellite information, and is especially useful for plants without reference genome sequences.


RESULTS
in this study, enriched dna libraries of tree peony, a well-known ornamental woody shrub, were used for high-throughput microsatellite development by  <dig> gs-flx titanium pyrosequencing. we obtained  <dig>  reads with an average length of 356 bp. the total size of examined sequences was  <dig> ,018 bp, from which  <dig>  ssrs were identified. of these sequences,  <dig>  contained ssrs, with 27% featuring more than one ssr. interestingly, a high proportion of ssrs  were present in compound formation. ssrs with repeat motifs of 1–4 bp  accounted for  <dig> % of ssrs. di-nucleotide repeats were the most abundant. as in most plants, the predominant motif in tree peony was n, with n less common. the lengths of ssrs were classified into  <dig> groups. the shortest ssrs  represented 1% of the total number, whereas ssrs 21– <dig> and 101–110 bp long accounted for 26% and 29%, respectively, of all ssrs. many sequences  were mapped to cds  regions using arabidopsis as a reference. go annotation analysis predicted that cdss with ssrs performed various functions associated with cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes. of  <dig> validated primer pairs,  <dig> were selected for polymorphism analysis among  <dig> genotypes; cluster analysis of the resulting data grouped genotypes according to known relationships, confirming the usefulness of the developed ssr markers.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of our large-scale ssr marker development using tree peony are valuable for investigating plant genomic structural evolution and elucidating phenotypic variation in this species during its evolution and artificial selection. the newly identified ssrs should be useful for genetic linkage map construction, qtl mapping, gene location and cloning, and molecular marker-assisted breeding. in addition, the genome-wide marker resources generated in this study should aid genomic studies of tree peony and related species.
