BACKGROUND
d-ribose in cells and human serum participates in glycation of proteins resulting in advanced glycation end products  that affect cell metabolism and induce cell death. however, the mechanism by which d-ribose-glycated proteins induce cell death is still unclear.


RESULTS
here, we incubated d-ribose with bovine serum albumin  and observed changes in the intensity of fluorescence at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm to monitor the formation of d-ribose-glycated bsa. comparing glycation of bsa with xylose , glucose and fructose , the rate of glycation with d-ribose was the most rapid. protein intrinsic fluorescence , nitroblue tetrazolium  assays and western blotting with anti-ages showed that glycation of bsa incubated with d-ribose occurred faster than for the other reducing sugars. protein intrinsic fluorescence showed marked conformational changes when bsa was incubated with d-ribose. importantly, observations with atomic force microscopy showed that d-ribose-glycated bsa appeared in globular polymers. furthermore, a fluorescent assay with thioflavin t  showed a remarkable increase in fluorescence at  <dig> nm in the presence of d-ribose-glycated bsa. however, tht fluorescence did not show the same marked increase in the presence of xylose or glucose. this suggests that glycation with d-ribose induced bsa to aggregate into globular amyloid-like deposits. as observed by hoechst  <dig> staining, 3-- <dig> -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide  and cell counting kit- <dig>  assay, lactate dehydrogenase  activity assay, flow cytometry using annexin v and propidium iodide staining and reactive oxygen species  measurements, the amyloid-like aggregation of glycated bsa induced apoptosis in the neurotypic cell line sh-sy5y.


CONCLUSIONS
glycation with d-ribose induces bsa to misfold rapidly and form globular amyloid-like aggregations which play an important role in cytotoxicity to neural cells.
