BACKGROUND
positive selection of host proteins that interact with pathogens can indicate factors relevant for infection and potentially be a measure of pathogen driven evolution.


RESULTS
our analysis of  <dig> primate genes and  <dig> lentivirus genomes points to specific host factors of high genetic variability that could account for differences in susceptibility to disease and indicate specific mechanisms of host defense and pathogen adaptation. we find that the largest amount of genetic change occurs in genes coding for cellular membrane proteins of the host as well as in the viral envelope genes suggesting cell entry and immune evasion as the primary evolutionary interface between host and pathogen. we additionally detect the innate immune response as a gene functional group harboring large differences among primates that could potentially account for the different levels of immune activation in the hiv/siv primate infection. we find a significant correlation between the evolutionary rates of interacting host and viral proteins pointing to processes of the host-pathogen biology that are relatively conserved among species and to those undergoing accelerated genetic evolution.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate specific host factors and their functional groups experiencing pathogen driven evolutionary selection pressures. individual host factors pointed to by our analysis might merit further study as potential targets of antiretroviral therapies.
