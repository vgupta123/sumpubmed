BACKGROUND
gata <dig> and fog <dig> proteins are required for normal cardiac development in mice. it has been proposed that gata4/fog <dig> transcription complex exercises its function through gene activation as well as repression; however, targets of gata4/fog <dig> action in the heart remain elusive.


RESULTS
here we report identification of the lhx <dig> gene as a direct target of the gata4/fog <dig> complex. we demonstrate that the developing mouse heart normally expresses truncated isoforms of lhx <dig> – lhx9α and lhx9β, and not the lhx9-hd isoform that encodes a protein with an intact homeodomain. at e <dig>  lhx9α/β expression is prominent in the epicardial primordium, septum transversum while lhx9-hd is absent from this tissue; in the e <dig>  heart lhx9α/β-positive cells are restricted to the epicardial mesothelium. thereafter in the control hearts lhx9α/β epicardial expression is promptly down-regulated; in contrast, mouse mutants with fog <dig> gene loss fail to repress lhx9α/β expression. chromatin immunoprecipitation from the e <dig>  hearts demonstrated that lhx <dig> is a direct target for gata <dig> and fog <dig>  in transient transfection studies the expression driven by the cis-regulatory regions of lhx <dig> was repressed by fog <dig> in the presence of intact gata <dig>  but not the gata4ki mutant that is impaired in its ability to bind fog <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the lhx <dig> gene represents the first direct target of the gata4/fog <dig> repressor complex in cardiac development.
