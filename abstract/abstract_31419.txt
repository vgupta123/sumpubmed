BACKGROUND
multiple cell types including trophoblasts, osteoclasts and myoblasts require somatic cell fusion events as part of their physiological functions. in drosophila melanogaster the paralogus type  <dig> transmembrane receptors and members of the immunoglobulin superfamily kin of irre  and roughest  regulate myoblast fusion during embryonic development. present within the human genome are three homologs to kirre termed kin of irre like   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  currently it is unknown if kirrel <dig> is expressed in adult human skeletal muscle.


RESULTS
we investigated  kirrel <dig> in adult human skeletal muscle samples taken at rest and after mild exercise induced muscle damage. kirrel <dig> mrna expression was verified by sequencing and protein presence via blotting with  <dig> different anti-kirrel <dig> protein antibodies. evidence for three alternatively spliced kirrel <dig> mrna transcripts in adult human skeletal muscle was obtained. kirrel <dig> mrna in adult human skeletal muscle was detected at low or moderate levels, or not at all. this sporadic expression suggests that kirrel <dig> is expressed in a pulsatile manner. several anti kirrel <dig> immunoreactive proteins were detected in all adult human skeletal muscle samples analysed and results suggest the presence of different isoforms or posttranslational modification, or both.


CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here demonstrate for the first time that there are at least  <dig> splice variants of kirrel <dig> expressed in adult human skeletal muscle, two of which have never previously been identified in human muscle. importantly, mrna of all splice variants was not always present, a finding with potential physiological relevance. these initial discoveries highlight the need for more molecular and functional studies to understand the role of kirrel <dig> in human skeletal muscle.
