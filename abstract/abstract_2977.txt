BACKGROUND
characterization of population structure and genetic diversity of germplasm is essential for the efficient organization and utilization of breeding material. the objectives of this study were to  explore the patterns of population structure in the pollen parent heterotic pool using different methods,  investigate the genome-wide distribution of genetic diversity, and  assess the extent and genome-wide distribution of linkage disequilibrium  in elite sugar beet germplasm.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> and  <dig> inbred lines from the yield type and sugar type inbreds of the pollen parent heterotic gene pools, respectively, which had been genotyped with  <dig> snp markers, were used in this study. two distinct subgroups were detected based on different statistical methods within the elite sugar beet germplasm set, which was in accordance with its breeding history. mclust based on principal components, principal coordinates, or lapvectors had high correspondence with the germplasm type information as well as the assignment by structure, which indicated that these methods might be alternatives to structure for population structure analysis. gene diversity and modified roger's distance between the examined germplasm types varied considerably across the genome, which might be due to artificial selection. this observation indicates that population genetic approaches could be used to identify candidate genes for the traits under selection. due to the fact that r <dig> > <dig>  is required to detect marker-phenotype association explaining less than 1% of the phenotypic variance, our observation of a low proportion of snp loci pairs showing such levels of ld suggests that the number of markers has to be dramatically increased for powerful genome-wide association mapping.


CONCLUSIONS
we provided a genome-wide distribution map of genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium for the elite sugar beet germplasm, which is useful for the application of genome-wide association mapping in sugar beet as well as the efficient organization of germplasm.
