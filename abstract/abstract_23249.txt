BACKGROUND
exportin  <dig> , is a chaperone protein responsible for the export of over  <dig> target proteins out of the nucleus. the expression and activity of xpo <dig> is upregulated in several human cancers and its expression is also linked to the development of chemotherapy resistance. recent studies using both human and murine cancer cell lines have demonstrated that xpo <dig> is a relevant target for therapeutic intervention. the present study sought to characterize the biologic activity of an orally bioavailable selective inhibitor of nuclear export , kpt- <dig>  against canine melanoma cell lines as a prelude to future clinical trials in dogs with melanoma.


RESULTS
we evaluated the effects of kpt- <dig> on  <dig> canine malignant melanoma cell lines and found that kpt- <dig> inhibited proliferation, blocked colony formation, and induced apoptosis of treated cells at biologically relevant concentrations of drug. additionally, kpt- <dig> downregulated xpo <dig> protein while inducing a concomitant increase in xpo <dig> messenger rna. lastly, kpt- <dig> treatment of cell lines upregulated the expression of both protein and mrna for the tumor suppressor proteins p <dig> and p <dig>  and promoted their nuclear localization.


CONCLUSIONS
kpt- <dig> demonstrates biologic activity against canine melanoma cell lines at physiologically relevant doses, suggesting that kpt- <dig> may represent a viable treatment option for dogs with malignant melanoma.
