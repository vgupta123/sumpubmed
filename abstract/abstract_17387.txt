BACKGROUND
disabled- <dig>  is an endocytic adaptor protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and cargo trafficking. since its expression is lost in several cancer types, dab <dig> has been suggested to be a tumor suppressor. in vitro studies indicate that dab <dig> establishes epithelial cell polarity and organization by directing endocytic trafficking of membrane glycoproteins. dab <dig> also modulates cellular signaling pathways by mediating the endocytosis and recycling of surface receptors and associated signaling components. previously, two independent gene knockout studies have been reported, with some discrepancies in the observed embryonic phenotypes. to further clarify the in vivo roles of dab <dig> in development and physiology, we designed a new floxed allele to delete dab <dig> gene.


RESULTS
the constitutive dab <dig> deleted embryos showed a spectrum in the degree of endoderm disorganization in e <dig>  and no mutant embryos persisted at e <dig> . however, the mice were grossly normal when dab <dig> deletion was restricted to the embryo proper and the gene was retained in extraembryonic tissues using meox2-cre and sox2-cre. adult dab2-deficient mice had a small but statistically significant increase in serum cholesterol levels.


CONCLUSIONS
the study of the new dab <dig> mutant allele in embryos and embryoid bodies confirms a role for dab <dig> in extraembryonic endoderm development and epithelial organization. experimental results with embryoid bodies suggest that additional endocytic adaptors such as arh and numb could partially compensate for dab <dig> loss. conditional deletion indicates that dab <dig> is dispensable for organ development, when the vast majority of the embryonic cells are dab <dig> null. however, dab <dig> has a physiological role in the endocytosis of lipoproteins and cholesterol metabolism.
