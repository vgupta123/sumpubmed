BACKGROUND
mangotoxin is an antimetabolite toxin that is produced by strains of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae; mangotoxin-producing strains are primarily isolated from mango tissues with symptoms of bacterial apical necrosis. the toxin is an oligopeptide that inhibits ornithine n-acetyl transferase , a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of the essential amino acids ornithine and arginine. the involvement of a putative nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene  in mangotoxin production and virulence has been reported.


RESULTS
in the present study, we performed a rt-pcr analysis, insertional inactivation mutagenesis, a promoter expression analysis and terminator localisation to study the gene cluster containing the mgoa gene. additionally, we evaluated the importance of mgoc, mgoa and mgod in mangotoxin production. a sequence analysis revealed an operon-like organisation. a promoter sequence was located upstream of the mgob gene and was found to drive lacz transcription. two terminators were located downstream of the mgod gene. rt-pcr experiments indicated that the four genes  constitute a transcriptional unit. this operon is similar in genetic organisation to those in the three other p. syringae pathovars for which complete genomes are available . interestingly, none of these three reference strains is capable of producing mangotoxin. additionally, extract complementation resulted in a recovery of mangotoxin production when the defective mutant was complemented with wild-type extracts.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study confirm that mgob, mgoc, mgoa and mgod function as a transcriptional unit and operon. while this operon is composed of four genes, only the last three are directly involved in mangotoxin production.
