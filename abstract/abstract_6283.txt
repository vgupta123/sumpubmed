BACKGROUND
correolide, a nortriterpene isolated from the costa rican tree spachea correa, is a novel immunosuppressant, which blocks kv <dig>  channels in human t lymphocytes. earlier mutational studies suggest that correolide binds in the channel pore. correolide has several nucleophilic groups, but the pore-lining helices in kv <dig>  are predominantly hydrophobic raising questions about the nature of correolide-channel interactions.


RESULTS
we employed the method of monte carlo  with energy minimization to search for optimal complexes of correolide in kv <dig> -based models of the open kv <dig>  with potassium binding sites 2/ <dig> or 1/3/ <dig> loaded with k+ ions. the energy was mc-minimized from many randomly generated starting positions and orientations of the ligand. in all the predicted low-energy complexes, oxygen atoms of correolide chelate a k+ ion. correolide-sensing residues known from mutational analysis along with the ligand-bound k+ ion provide major contributions to the ligand-binding energy. deficiency of k+ ions in the selectivity filter of c-type inactivated kv <dig>  would stabilize k+-bound correolide in the inner pore.


CONCLUSIONS
our study explains the paradox that cationic and nucleophilic ligands bind to the same region in the inner pore of k+ channels and suggests that a k+ ion is an important determinant of the correolide receptor and possibly receptors of other nucleophilic blockers of the inner pore of k+ channels.
