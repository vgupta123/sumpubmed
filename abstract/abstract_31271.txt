BACKGROUND
infection with toxoplasma gondii in water buffaloes  is of epidemiological importance because of the risk for transmission to humans. we sought to determine the seroprevalence of t. gondii infection in  <dig> water buffaloes in veracruz state, mexico using the modified agglutination test . seroprevalence association with general characteristics of buffaloes and their environment was also investigated.


RESULTS
antibodies to t. gondii were found in  <dig>  of the  <dig> buffaloes with mat titers of 1: <dig> in  <dig>  1: <dig> in  <dig>  and 1: <dig> in  <dig>  bivariate analysis showed that seroprevalence of t. gondii infection was similar in buffaloes regardless of their general characteristics i.e., age, sex, and breed. in contrast, the seroprevalence in buffaloes varied significantly with environmental characteristics including altitude, mean annual temperature, and mean annual rainfall of the municipalities studied. multivariate analysis showed that t. gondii seropositivity in buffaloes was associated with a mean annual rainfall between 1266–1650 mm .


CONCLUSIONS
results indicate that environmental characteristics may influence the seroprevalence of t. gondii infection in buffaloes. this is the first report on the seroprevalence of t. gondii infection in buffaloes in mexico. further research is needed to assess the risk for infection in humans associated with the ingestion of raw or undercooked meat from buffaloes infected with t. gondii.
