BACKGROUND
alkanes have been hypothesized to act as universal inducers of bacterial cytochrome p <dig> gene expression. we tested this hypothesis on an unusual p <dig> gene  found on a conserved  <dig> kilobase episomal dna element of unknown function found in filamentous cyanobacteria. we also monitored the binding of potential substrates to the p <dig> protein and explored the distribution of p <dig> protein in vegetative cells and nitrogen-fixing heterocysts using immuno-electron microscopy.


RESULTS
hexadecane treatments resulted in a two-fold increase in mrna, and a four-fold increase in p <dig> protein levels relative to control cultures. hexane, octane and dodecane were toxic and induced substantial changes in membrane morphology. long-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were shown to bind the cyp <dig> protein using a spectroscopic spin-shift assay, but alkanes did not bind. cyp <dig> protein was detected in vegetative cells but not in differentiated heterocysts where nitrogen fixation occurs.


CONCLUSIONS
hexadecane treatment was an effective inducer of cyp <dig> expression in cyanobacteria. based on substrate binding profiles and amino acid sequence similarities it is hypothesized that cyp <dig> is a fatty acid Ï‰-hydroxylase in photosynthetic cells. cyp <dig> was found associated with membrane fractions unlike other soluble microbial p <dig> proteins, and in this regard cyp <dig> more closely resembles eukarytotic p450s. substrate stablization is an unlikely mechanism for alkane induction because alkanes did not bind to purified cyp <dig> protein.
