BACKGROUND
dioxins are one of the most toxic groups of persistent organic pollutants. their biotransmission through the food chain constitutes a potential risk for human health. plants as principal actors in the food chain can play a determinant role in removing dioxins from the environment. due to the lack of data on dioxin/plant research, this study sets out to determine few responsive reactions adopted by arabidopsis plant towards  <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin , the most toxic congener of dioxins.


RESULTS
using a high resolution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, we demonstrated that arabidopsis plant uptakes tcdd by the roots and accumulates it in the vegetative parts in a tissue-specific manner. tcdd mainly accumulated in rosette leaves and mature seeds and less in stem, flowers and immature siliques. moreover, we observed that plants exposed to high doses of tcdd exhibited a delay in flowering and yielded fewer seeds of a reduced oil content with a low vitality. a particular focus on the plant fatty acid metabolism showed that tcdd caused a significant reduction in c18-unsaturated fatty acid level in plant tissues. simultaneously, tcdd induced the expression of 9-lox and 13-lox genes and the formation of their corresponding hydroperoxides, 9- and 13-hpod as well as 9- or 13-hpot, derived from linoleic and linolenic acids, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the current work highlights a side of toxicological effects resulting in the administration of  <dig> , <dig> -tcdd on the arabidopsis plant. similarly to animals, it seems that plants may accumulate tcdd in their lipids by involving few of the fa-metabolizing enzymes for sculpting a specific oxylipins “signature” typified to plant tcdd-tolerance. together, our results uncover novel responses of arabidopsis to dioxin, possibly emerging to overcome its toxicity.
