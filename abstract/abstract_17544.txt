BACKGROUND
the naid annelids contain a number of species that vary in their ability to regenerate lost body parts, making them excellent candidates for evolution of regeneration studies. however, scant sequence data exists to facilitate such studies. we constructed a cdna library from the naid pristina leidyi, a species that is highly regenerative and also reproduces asexually by fission, using material from a range of regeneration and fission stages for our library. we then sequenced the transcriptome of p. leidyi using  <dig> technology.


RESULTS
 <dig> sequencing produced  <dig> , <dig> reads with an average read length of  <dig> nucleotides. assembly of  <dig> sequence reads resulted in  <dig>  isogroups and  <dig>  singletons for a total of  <dig>  unigenes in this transcriptome. we estimate that over 95% of the transcripts in our library are present in our transcriptome.  <dig> % of isogroups had significant blast hits to the uniprot database and these include putative homologs of a number of genes relevant to regeneration research. although many sequences are incomplete, the mean sequence length of transcripts  is  <dig> nucleotides. thus, many sequences are large enough to be immediately useful for downstream applications such as gene expression analyses. using in situ hybridization, we show that two wnt/Î²-catenin pathway genes  present in our transcriptome are expressed in the regeneration blastema of p. leidyi, demonstrating the usefulness of this resource for regeneration research.


CONCLUSIONS
 <dig> sequencing is a rapid and efficient approach for identifying large numbers of genes in an organism that lacks a sequenced genome. this transcriptome dataset will be a valuable resource for molecular analyses of regeneration in p. leidyi and will serve as a starting point for comparisons to non-regenerating naids. it also contributes significantly to the still limited genomic resources available for annelids and lophotrochozoans more generally.
