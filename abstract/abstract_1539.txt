BACKGROUND
dna vaccines offer several advantages over conventional vaccines in the development of effective vaccines against avian influenza virus . however, one of the limitations of the dna vaccine in poultry is that it induces poor immune responses. in this study, chicken interleukin  - <dig> and il- <dig> were used as genetic adjuvants to improve the immune responses induced from the h <dig> dna vaccination in chickens. the immunogenicity of the recombinant plasmid dna was analyzed based on the antibody production, t cell responses and cytokine production, following inoculation in 1-day-old  and 14-day-old  specific-pathogen-free chickens. hence, the purpose of the present study was to explore the role of chicken il- <dig> and il- <dig> as adjuvants following the vaccination of chickens with the h <dig> dna vaccine.


RESULTS
the overall hi antibody titer in chickens immunized with pdis/h5 + pdis/il- <dig> was higher compared to chickens immunized with pdis/h <dig> . the findings revealed that the inoculation of the 14-day-old chickens exhibited a shorter time to achieve the highest hi titer in comparison to the inoculation of the 1-day-old chickens. the cellular immunity was assessed by the flow cytometry analysis to enumerate cd4+ and cd <dig> + t cells in the peripheral blood. the chickens inoculated with pdis/h5 + pdis/il- <dig> demonstrated the highest increase in cd4+ t cells population relative to the control chickens. however, this study revealed that pdis/h5 + pdis/il- <dig> was not significant  in inducing cd8+ t cells. meanwhile, with the exception of trial  <dig>  the flow cytometry results for trial  <dig> demonstrated that the pdis/h5 + pdis/il- <dig> inoculated group was able to trigger a higher increase in cd4+ t cells than the pdis/h <dig> group . on the other hand, the pdis/h5 + pdis/il- <dig> group was not significant  in modulating cd8+ t cells population in both trials. the pdis/h5 + pdis/il- <dig> inoculated group showed the highest il- <dig> gene expression in both trials compared to other inoculated groups . similar results were obtained for the il- <dig> expression where the pdis/h5 + pdis/il- <dig> groups in both trials  were significantly higher compared to the control group . however, the expressions of other cytokines remained low or undetected by gexp assay.


CONCLUSIONS
this study shows the diverse immunogenicity of pdis/h <dig> co-administered with chicken il- <dig> and il- <dig> with pdis/h5 + pdis/il- <dig> being a better vaccine candidate compared to other groups.
