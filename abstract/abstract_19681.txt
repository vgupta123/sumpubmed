BACKGROUND
male irs2-/- mice develop fatal type  <dig> diabetes at 13- <dig> weeks. defects in neuronal proliferation, pituitary development and photoreceptor cell survival manifest in irs2-/- mice. we identify retarded renal growth in male and female irs2-/- mice, independent of diabetes.


RESULTS
kidney size and kidney:body weight ratio were reduced by approximately 20% in irs2-/- mice at postnatal day  <dig> and was maintained in maturity. reduced glomerular number but similar glomerular density was detected in irs2-/- kidney compared to wild-type, suggesting intact global kidney structure. analysis of insulin signalling revealed renal-specific upregulation of pkbβ/akt <dig>  hyperphosphorylation of gsk3β and concomitant accumulation of β-catenin in irs2-/- kidney. despite this, no significant upregulation of β-catenin targets was detected. kidney-specific increases in yes-associated protein , a key driver of organ size were also detected in the absence of irs <dig>  yap phosphorylation on its inhibitory site ser <dig> was also increased, with no change in the levels of yap-regulated genes, suggesting that overall yap activity was not increased in irs2-/- kidney.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, deletion of irs <dig> causes reduced kidney size early in mouse development. compensatory mechanisms such as increased β-catenin and yap levels failed to overcome this developmental defect. these data point to irs <dig> as an important novel mediator of kidney size.
