BACKGROUND
consistent asymmetry of the left-right  axis is a crucial aspect of vertebrate embryogenesis. asymmetric gene expression of the tgfÎ² superfamily member nodal related  <dig>  in the left lateral mesoderm plate is a highly conserved step regulating the situs of the heart and viscera. in xenopus, movement of maternal serotonin  through gap-junctional paths at cleavage stages dictates asymmetry upstream of nr <dig>  however, the mechanisms linking earlier biophysical asymmetries with this transcriptional control point are not known.


RESULTS
to understand how an early physiological gradient is transduced into a late, stable pattern of nr <dig> expression we investigated epigenetic regulation during lr patterning. embryos injected with mrna encoding a dominant-negative of histone deacetylase  lacked nr <dig> expression and exhibited randomized sidedness of the heart and viscera  at stage  <dig>  timing analysis using pharmacological blockade of hdacs implicated cleavage stages as the active period. inhibition during these early stages was correlated with an absence of nr <dig> expression at stage  <dig>  high levels of heterotaxia at stage  <dig>  and the deposition of the epigenetic marker h3k4me <dig> on the nr <dig> gene. to link the epigenetic machinery to the 5ht signaling pathway, we performed a high-throughput proteomic screen for novel cytoplasmic 5ht partners associated with the epigenetic machinery. the data identified the known hdac partner protein mad <dig> as a 5ht-binding regulator. while mad <dig> overexpression led to an absence of nr <dig> transcription and randomized the lr axis, a mutant form of mad <dig> lacking 5ht binding sites was not able to induce heterotaxia, showing that mad3's biological activity is dependent on 5ht binding.


CONCLUSIONS
hdac activity is a new lr determinant controlling the epigenetic state of nr <dig> from early developmental stages. the hdac binding partner mad <dig> may be a new serotonin-dependent regulator of asymmetry linking early physiological asymmetries to stable changes in gene expression during organogenesis.
