BACKGROUND
hantaviruses are emerging zoonotic pathogens which cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, an immune-mediated pathogenesis is discussed. the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of tgf-β expression in acute hantavirus infection.


RESULTS
we retrospectively studied  <dig> patients hospitalised with acute puumala infection during a hantavirus epidemic in germany in  <dig>  hantavirus infection was confirmed by positive anti-puumala hantavirus igg and igm. plasma levels of transforming growth factor -β <dig> and tgf-β <dig> were analysed. based on glomerular filtration rate on admission, patients were divided in mild and severe course of disease. puumala virus rna was detected by pcr amplification of the viral l segment gene. out of  <dig> puumala virus infected patients,  <dig>  were male. a seasonal distribution was detected in our cohort with a peak in summer  <dig>  the highest incidence was observed in the age group of 30– <dig> years. puumala virus rna was detectable in 4/ <dig> cases. patients with severe disease had a significant longer hospital stay than patients with mild disease . thrombocyte count , serum tgf-β <dig>  and tgf-β <dig>  were significantly lower in severe compared to mild disease. however, c-reactive protein  was significantly higher in patients with severe disease . tgf-β1/cr was the most sensitive and specific marker associated with renal dysfunction.


CONCLUSIONS
high serum crp and low serum tgf-β in the early phase of hantavirus infection is associated with a severe course of disease. our results support the hypothesis of an immune-mediated pathogenesis in hantavirus infection.
