BACKGROUND
hsp <dig> chaperones are required for key cellular processes and response to environmental changes and survival but they have not been fully characterized yet. the human hsp70-gene family has an unknown number of members ; some have been described but the information is incomplete and inconsistent. a coherent body of knowledge encompassing all family components that would facilitate their study individually and as a group is lacking. nowadays, the study of chaperone genes benefits from the availability of genome sequences and a new protocol, chaperonomics, which we applied to elucidate the human hsp <dig> family.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> hsp <dig> sequences,  <dig> genes and  <dig> pseudogenes. the genes distributed into seven evolutionarily distinct groups with distinguishable subgroups according to phylogenetic and other data, such as exon-intron and protein features. the n-terminal atp-binding domain  was conserved at least partially in the majority of the proteins but the c-terminal substrate-binding domain  was not. nine proteins were typical hsp70s  with abd and sbd, two were lighter lacking partly or totally the sbd, and six were heavier  with divergent c-terminal domains. we also analyzed exon-intron features, transcriptional variants and protein structure and isoforms, and modality and patterns of expression in various tissues and developmental stages. evolutionary analyses, including human hsp <dig> genes and pseudogenes, and other eukaryotic hsp <dig> genes, showed that six human genes encoding cytosolic hsp70s and  <dig> pseudogenes originated from retro-transposition of hspa <dig>  a gene highly expressed in most tissues and developmental stages.


CONCLUSIONS
the human hsp70-gene family is characterized by a remarkable evolutionary diversity that mainly resulted from multiple duplications and retrotranspositions of a highly expressed gene, hspa <dig>  human hsp <dig> proteins are clustered into seven evolutionary groups, with divergent c-terminal domains likely defining their distinctive functions. these functions may also be further defined by the observed differences in the n-terminal domain.
