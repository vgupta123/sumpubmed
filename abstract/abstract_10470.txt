BACKGROUND
visual neurons respond essentially to luminance variations occurring within their receptive fields. in primary visual cortex, each neuron is a filter for stimulus features such as orientation, motion direction and velocity, with the appropriate combination of features eliciting maximal firing rate. temporal correlation of spike trains was proposed as a potential code for linking the neuronal responses evoked by various features of a same object. in the present study, synchrony strength was measured between cells following an adaptation protocol  which induce plasticity of neurons' orientation preference.


RESULTS
multi-unit activity from area  <dig> of anesthetized adult cats was recorded. single cells were sorted out and  orientation tuning curves were measured before and following  <dig> min adaptation and  <dig> min after adaptation  pairwise synchrony was measured by an index that was normalized in relation to the cells' firing rate. we first observed that the prolonged presentation of a non-preferred stimulus produces attractive  and repulsive  shifts of cell's tuning curves. it follows that the adaptation-induced plasticity leads to changes in preferred orientation difference, i.e. increase or decrease in tuning properties between neurons. we report here that, after adaptation, the neuron pairs that shared closer tuning properties display a significant increase of synchronization. recovery from adaptation was accompanied by a return to the initial synchrony level.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that synchrony reflects the similarity in neurons' response properties, and varies accordingly when these properties change.
