BACKGROUND
one of the primary objectives in cancer research is to identify causal genomic alterations, such as somatic copy number variation  and somatic mutations, during tumor development. many valuable studies lack genomic data to detect cnv; therefore, methods that are able to infer cnvs from gene expression data would help maximize the value of these studies.


RESULTS
we developed a framework for identifying recurrent regions of cnv and distinguishing the cancer driver genes from the passenger genes in the regions. by inferring cnv regions across many datasets we were able to identify  <dig> recurrent amplified/deleted cnv regions. many of these regions are enriched for genes involved in many important processes associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression. genes in these recurrent cnv regions were then examined in the context of gene regulatory networks to prioritize putative cancer driver genes. the cancer driver genes uncovered by the framework include not only well-known oncogenes but also a number of novel cancer susceptibility genes validated via sirna experiments.


CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first effort to systematically identify and validate drivers for expression based cnv regions in breast cancer. the framework where the wavelet analysis of copy number alteration based on expression coupled with the gene regulatory network analysis, provides a blueprint for leveraging genomic data to identify key regulatory components and gene targets. this integrative approach can be applied to many other large-scale gene expression studies and other novel types of cancer data such as next-generation sequencing based expression  as well as cnv data.
