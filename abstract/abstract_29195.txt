BACKGROUND
multi-item adverse drug event  associations are associations relating multiple drugs to possibly multiple adverse events. the current standard in pharmacovigilance is bivariate association analysis, where each single drug-adverse effect combination is studied separately. the importance and difficulty in the detection of multi-item ade associations was noted in several prominent pharmacovigilance studies. in this paper we examine the application of a well established data mining method known as association rule mining, which we tailored to the above problem, and demonstrate its value. the method was applied to the fdas spontaneous adverse event reporting system  with minimal restrictions and expectations on its output, an experiment that has not been previously done on the scale and generality proposed in this work.


RESULTS
based on a set of  <dig>  reports of suspected ades reported to aers and published in the year  <dig>  our method identified  <dig> multi-item ade associations. a taxonomy that characterizes the associations was developed based on a representative sample. a significant number  of potential multi-item ade associations identified were characterized and clinically validated by a domain expert as previously recognized ade associations. several potentially novel ades were also identified. a smaller proportion  of associations were characterized and validated as known drug-drug interactions.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings demonstrate that multi-item ades are present and can be extracted from the fda’s adverse effect reporting system using our methodology, suggesting that our method is a valid approach for the initial identification of multi-item ades. the study also revealed several limitations and challenges that can be attributed to both the method and quality of data.
