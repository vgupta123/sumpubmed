BACKGROUND
cbl <dig> is a calcium sensor that regulates drought, cold and salt signals in arabidopsis. overexpression of cbl <dig> gene in arabidopsis and in ammopiptanthus mongolicus showed different tolerant activities. we are interested in understanding the molecular mechanism of the upstream region of the cbl <dig> gene of a. mongolicus . we investigated and characterized the promoter of the amcbl <dig> gene, for promoters play a very important role in regulating gene expression in eukaryotes.


RESULTS
a 1683-bp 5' flanking region was isolated from a. mongolicus. the sequence was identified as amcbl <dig> promoter. analysis of the promoter sequence indicated a 690-bp intron and some basic cis-acting elements were related to various environmental stresses and plant hormones. to identify the functional region of the amcbl <dig> promoter, five plant expression vectors fused with the gus  gene, driven by series deleted fragments of amcbl <dig> promoter at different lengths from - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> to - <dig> bp relative to the transcriptional start site were constructed and transformed into nicotiana tabacum l. cv.  <dig>  functional properties of each promoter segment were examined by gus staining and fluorescence quantitative analyses using at least three single-copy pcr-positive plants of transgenic tobacco, treated with various environmental stresses and plant hormones for different times. we demonstrated that the amcbl <dig> promoter was a vascular-specific and multiple-stress-inducible promoter. our results further imply that the promoter fragment b1s <dig> possessed sufficient essential cis-acting elements, accounting for vascular-specific and stress-induced expression patterns. it may also indicate that for response to some stresses certain cis-elements are required in tissues outside the region of the b1s <dig> construct.


CONCLUSIONS
to help resolve uncertainties about the upstream regulatory mechanism of the cbl <dig> gene in desert plants, we suggest that the function of the amcbl <dig> promoter, particularly under conditions of abiotic stress, to be examined for possible usefulness in molecular breeding. regardless of the outcome, the allocation and relative quantification of the gus-fusion amcbl <dig> promoter segments at transcriptional levels in different tissues under various stresses across separate promoter segments suggests that the amcbl <dig> promoter is a phloem-specific and multiple-stress-inducible promoter. these data coupled with the ongoing amcbl <dig> 5' utr intron analyses provide a solid foundation for their future use in molecular breeding as new promoters of stress-resistance genes from desert plants.
