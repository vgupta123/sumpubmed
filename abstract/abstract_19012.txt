BACKGROUND
recent analysis of the mouse transcriptional data has revealed the existence of ~ <dig>  messenger-like non-coding rnas . whereas the functional properties of these ml-ncrnas are beginning to be unravelled, no functional information is available for the large majority of these transcripts.


RESULTS
a few ml-ncrna have been shown to have genomic loci that overlap with microrna loci, leading us to suspect that a fraction of ml-ncrna may encode micrornas. we therefore developed an algorithm  for specifically detecting potential microrna-encoding transcripts in the entire set of  <dig>  mouse full-length ml-ncrnas. in combination with mouse-rat sequence conservation, this algorithm detected  <dig>  strong mirna-encoding candidates, and for  <dig> of these we obtained experimental evidence for the existence of their corresponding mature microrna by microarray and stem-loop rt-pcr. sequence analysis of the microrna-encoding rnas revealed an internal motif, whose presence correlates strongly  with the occurrence of stem-loops with characteristics of known pre-mirnas, indicating the presence of a larger number microrna-encoding rnas  in the ml-ncrnas population.


CONCLUSIONS
our work highlights a unique group of ml-ncrnas and offers clues to their functions.
