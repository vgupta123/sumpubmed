BACKGROUND
transcriptional gene regulation is a fundamental process in nature, and the experimental and computational investigation of dna binding motifs and their binding sites is a prerequisite for elucidating this process. approaches for de-novo motif discovery can be subdivided in phylogenetic footprinting that takes into account phylogenetic dependencies in aligned sequences of more than one species and non-phylogenetic approaches based on sequences from only one species that typically take into account intra-motif dependencies. it has been shown that modeling  phylogenetic dependencies as well as  intra-motif dependencies separately improves de-novo motif discovery, but there is no approach capable of modeling both  and  simultaneously.


RESULTS
here, we present an approach for de-novo motif discovery that combines phylogenetic footprinting with motif models capable of taking into account intra-motif dependencies. we study the degree of intra-motif dependencies inferred by this approach from chip-seq data of  <dig> transcription factors. we find that significant intra-motif dependencies of orders  <dig> and  <dig> are present in all  <dig> datasets and that intra-motif dependencies of order  <dig> are typically stronger than those of order  <dig>  we also find that the presented approach improves the classification performance of phylogenetic footprinting in all  <dig> datasets and that incorporating intra-motif dependencies of order  <dig> yields a higher classification performance than incorporating such dependencies of only order  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
combining phylogenetic footprinting with motif models incorporating intra-motif dependencies leads to an improved performance in the classification of transcription factor binding sites. this may advance our understanding of transcriptional gene regulation and its evolution.
