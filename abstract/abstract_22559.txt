BACKGROUND
gaucher disease is caused by defective glucocerebrosidase activity and the consequent accumulation of glucosylceramide. the pathogenic pathways resulting from lipid laden macrophages  in visceral organs and their abnormal functions are obscure.


RESULTS
to elucidate this pathogenic pathway, developmental global gene expression analyses were conducted in distinct gba <dig> point-mutated mice . about  <dig>  to 3% of genes had altered expression patterns , representing several categories, but particularly macrophage activation and immune response genes. time course analyses  of infγ-regulated pro-inflammatory  and il-4-regulated anti-inflammatory  cytokine/mediator networks showed tissue differential profiles in the lung and liver of the gba <dig> mutant mice, implying that the lipid-storage macrophages were not functionally inert. the time course alterations of the infγ and il- <dig> pathways were similar, but varied in degree in these tissues and with the gba <dig> mutation.


CONCLUSIONS
biochemical and pathological analyses demonstrated direct relationships between the degree of tissue glucosylceramides and the gene expression profile alterations. these analyses implicate ifnγ-regulated pro-inflammatory and il-4-regulated anti-inflammatory networks in differential disease progression with implications for understanding the gaucher disease course and pathophysiology.
