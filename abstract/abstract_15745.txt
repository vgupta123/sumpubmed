BACKGROUND
the growth and development of the posterior silk gland and the biosynthesis of the silk core protein at the fifth larval instar stage of bombyx mori are of paramount importance for silk production.


RESULTS
here, aided by next-generation sequencing and microarry assay, we profile  <dig>  micrornas , including  <dig> novel mirnas and  <dig> mirna/mirna* duplexes, of the posterior silk gland at the fifth larval instar. target gene prediction yields  <dig>  unique target genes from  <dig>  mirnas. functional categorization classifies the targets into complex pathways that include both cellular and metabolic processes, especially protein synthesis and processing.


CONCLUSIONS
the enrichment of target genes in the ribosome-related pathway indicates that mirnas may directly regulate translation. our findings pave a way for further functional elucidation of these mirnas and their targets in silk production.
