BACKGROUND
powdery mildew  causing fungi are well-known pathogens, infecting over  <dig>  plant species, including the economically important crop cucumber . loss-of-function mutations in clade v mlo genes have previously been shown to lead to recessively inherited broad-spectrum resistance to pm in several species. in cucumber, one clade v mlo homolog  was previously identified as being a susceptibility factor to pm. two other closely related homologs  were found, but their function was not yet unravelled.

methods

csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> were cloned from cucumber and overexpressed in a tomato mlo mutant. the transcript abundances of all three csamlo genes in different cucumber tissues were quantified using qrt-pcr and rna-seq, with and without inoculation with the cucumber pm fungus podosphaera xanthii. allelic variation of csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> was screened in silico in sequenced cucumber germplasm.


RESULTS
heterologous overexpression of all three csamlo genes in the tomato mlo mutant restored susceptibility to pm caused by oidium neolycopersici, albeit to a different extent: whereas overexpression of csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig> completely restored susceptibility, overexpression of csamlo <dig> was only partially able to restore pm susceptibility. furthermore, it was observed by qrt-pcr and rna-seq that csamlo <dig> was significantly higher expressed in non-inoculated cucumber compared to the other two mlo genes. however, inoculation with p. xanthii led to upregulation of csamlo <dig>  but not to upregulation of csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
both csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> are functional susceptibility genes, although we conclude that based on the transcript abundance csamlo <dig> is probably the major clade v mlo gene in cucumber regarding providing susceptibility to pm. potential loss-of-function mutations in csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> have not been identified. the generation and analysis of such mutants are interesting subjects for further investigation.
