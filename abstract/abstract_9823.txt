BACKGROUND
the potato type ii  family of proteinase inhibitors plays critical roles in the defense system of plants from solanaceae family against pests. to better understand the evolution of this family, we investigated the correlation between sequence and structural repeats within this family and the evolution and molecular adaptation of pot ii genes through computational analysis, using the putative ancestral domain sequence as the basic repeat unit.


RESULTS
our analysis discovered the following interesting findings in pot ii family.  we classified the structural domains in pot ii family into three types  according to the existence of two linkers between the two domain components, which clearly show the circular permutation relationship between the original repeat domain and circularly permuted domain.  the permuted domains appear more stable than original repeat domain, from available structural information. therefore, we proposed a multiple-repeat sequence is likely to adopt the permuted domain from contiguous sequence segments, with the n- and c-termini forming a single non-contiguous structural domain, linking the bracelet of tandem repeats.  the analysis of nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rates ratio in pot ii domain revealed heterogeneous selective pressures among amino acid sites: the reactive site is under positive darwinian selection  while the cysteine scaffold is under purifying selection .  for multi-repeat pot ii genes from nicotiana genus, the proteolytic processing site is under positive darwinian selection .


CONCLUSIONS
this paper provides comprehensive analysis and characterization of pot ii family, and enlightens our understanding on the strategies  of solanaceae plants for defending pathogenic attacks through the evolution of pot ii genes.
