BACKGROUND
hypovitaminosis d has previously been shown to be prevalent amongst dogs with protein losing enteropathy .

the hypothesis of this study was that low 25-hydroxyvitamin d  d) serum concentrations could be a risk factor for negative outcome in dogs with ple.

forty-three dogs diagnosed with ple  and which serum vitamin d serum concentrations were collected and archived at − <dig> degrees c were analyzed.

post-diagnostic communication with referring veterinarians was made to determine outcome of ple dogss: dogs which died due to ple within 4 months after diagnosis  and dogs alive or which died due to another disease at the end point of the study . serum samples taken at the time of diagnosis were analysed for ionized calcium  concentrations and serum  <dig> d concentration.


RESULTS
clinical  scores, age at ple diagnosis, and ica concentrations were not significantly different between dog groups. a significantly greater  number of ple dogs treated with hydrolyzed or elimination diet alone showed good outcome as compared to the ple negative outcome group. median serum  <dig> d concentration was significantly  lower in dogs with negative outcome versus ple dogs with good outcome. using logistic regression analysis,  <dig> d serum concentration was shown to be a statistically significant factor for outcome determination. cox regression analysis yielded a hazard ratio of  <dig>   per each one nmol/l increase in serum  <dig> d concentration.


CONCLUSIONS
low serum  <dig> d concentration in ple dogs was significantly associated with poor outcome. further studies are required to investigate the clinical efficacy of vitamin d  as a potential therapeutic agent for dogs with ple.
