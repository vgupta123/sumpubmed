BACKGROUND
coral reefs are expected to be severely impacted by rising seawater temperatures associated with climate change. this study used cdna microarrays to investigate transcriptional effects of thermal stress in embryos of the coral montastraea faveolata. embryos were exposed to  <dig> °c,  <dig> °c, and  <dig> °c directly after fertilization. differences in gene expression were measured after  <dig> and  <dig> hours.


RESULTS
analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated that increased temperatures may lead to oxidative stress, apoptosis, and a structural reconfiguration of the cytoskeletal network. metabolic processes were downregulated, and the action of histones and zinc finger-containing proteins may have played a role in the long-term regulation upon heat stress.


CONCLUSIONS
embryos responded differently depending on exposure time and temperature level. embryos showed expression of stress-related genes already at a temperature of  <dig> °c, but seemed to be able to counteract the initial response over time. by contrast, embryos at  <dig> °c displayed continuous expression of stress genes. the genes that played a role in the response to elevated temperatures consisted of both highly conserved and coral-specific genes. these genes might serve as a basis for research into coral-specific adaptations to stress responses and global climate change.
