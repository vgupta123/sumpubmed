BACKGROUND
large scale sequencing of cdna libraries can provide profiles of genes expressed in an organism under defined biological and environmental circumstances. we have analyzed sequences of  <dig> expressed sequence tags  from  <dig> different cdna libraries created from abdomens from plasmodium infection-susceptible adult female anopheles gambiae. these libraries were made from sugar fed , rat blood fed , and p. berghei-infected  mosquitoes at  <dig> hours after the blood meal, when most parasites would be transforming ookinetes or very early oocysts.


RESULTS
the s, rb and irb libraries contained  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> high quality ests, respectively, averaging  <dig> nucleotides  in length. they assembled into  <dig> consensus sequences â€“  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons. functional annotation was performed to annotate probable molecular functions of the gene products and the biological processes in which they function. genes represented at high frequency in one or more of the libraries were subjected to digital northern analysis and results on expression of  <dig> verified by qrt-pcr.


CONCLUSIONS
13% of the  <dig> ests showing identity to the a. gambiae genome sequence represent novel genes. these, together with untranslated regions  present on many of the ests, will inform further genome annotation. we have identified  <dig> genes encoding products likely to be involved in regulating the cellular oxidative environment and  <dig> insect immunity genes. we also identified  <dig> genes as being up or down regulated following blood feeding and/or feeding with p. berghei infected blood relative to their expression levels in sugar fed females.
