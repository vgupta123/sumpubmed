BACKGROUND
following the recent development of a new approach to quantitative analysis of igg concentrations in bovine serum using transmission infrared spectroscopy, the potential to measure igg levels using technology and a device better designed for field use was investigated. a method using attenuated total reflectance infrared  spectroscopy in combination with partial least squares  regression was developed to measure bovine serum igg concentrations. atr spectroscopy has a distinct ease-of-use advantage that may open the door to routine point-of-care testing. serum samples were collected from calves and adult cows, tested by a reference rid method, and atr spectra acquired. the spectra were linked to the rid-igg concentrations and then randomly split into two sets: calibration and prediction. the calibration set was used to build a calibration model, while the prediction set was used to assess the predictive performance and accuracy of the final model. the procedure was repeated for various spectral data preprocessing approaches.


RESULTS
for the prediction set, the pearson’s and concordance correlation coefficients between the igg measured by rid and predicted by atr spectroscopy were both  <dig> . the bland altman plot revealed no obvious systematic bias between the two methods. atr spectroscopy showed a sensitivity for detection of failure of transfer of passive immunity  of 88 %, specificity of 100 % and accuracy of 94 % .


CONCLUSIONS
atr spectroscopy in combination with multivariate data analysis shows potential as an alternative approach for rapid quantification of igg concentrations in bovine serum and the diagnosis of ftpi in calves.
