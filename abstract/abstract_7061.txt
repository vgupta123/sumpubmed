BACKGROUND
coxofemoral osteoarthritis is a chronic, disabling condition affecting people and dogs, with tha providing an excellent return to function in severely affected joints. the principal role of tha is to restore an adequate range of motion to the hip joint while transferring load from the acetabulum in order to improve the survival of the implant and enhance the limb function in the short and long terms. the objectives of the study reported here were, therefore, to radiographically evaluate periprosthetic acetabular bone gv and to assess prosthetic head acetabular coverage after 4 months of uncemented and cemented tha in dogs. means periprosthetic acetabular gv for each and combined  <dig> regions of interest  were calculated immediately and 4 months after tha. prosthetic head norberg  angle was also measured to assess the degree of prosthetic head acetabular coverage after 4 months of surgery.


RESULTS
zones  <dig> and  <dig> showed a significant increase in the mean bone gv after 4 months of uncemented tha. no differences in zones 1– <dig> after 4 months of cemented tha. combined zones showed a significant increase in overall mean bone gv 4 months after uncemented tha; whereas, no changes were identified after 4 months of cemented tha. the phn angles did not change after 4 months of uncemented and cemented tha and did not differ significantly between the  <dig> designs of hip arthroplasty.


CONCLUSIONS
regional periprosthetic acetabular bone gv varies with the design of tha. none of the designs showed periprosthetic acetabular bone lucency. no differences identified in the degree of prosthetic head acetabular coverage in both designs, indicating proper implant stability after 4 months of surgery. further longer–term investigation on larger population is however still warranted.
