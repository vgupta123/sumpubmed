BACKGROUND
breeding programs are usually reluctant to evaluate and use germplasm accessions other than the elite materials belonging to their advanced populations. the concept of core collections has been proposed to facilitate the access of potential users to samples of small sizes, representative of the genetic variability contained within the gene pool of a specific crop. the eventual large size of a core collection perpetuates the problem it was originally proposed to solve. the present study suggests that, in addition to the classic core collection concept, thematic core collections should be also developed for a specific crop, composed of a limited number of accessions, with a manageable size.


RESULTS
the thematic core collection obtained meets the minimum requirements for a core sample - maintenance of at least 80% of the allelic richness of the thematic collection, with, approximately, 15% of its size. the method was compared with other methodologies based on the m strategy, and also with a core collection generated by random sampling. higher proportions of retained alleles  or similar proportions of retained alleles  were detected in the two methods based on the m strategy compared to the proposed methodology. core sub-collections constructed by different methods were compared regarding the increase or maintenance of phenotypic diversity. no change on phenotypic diversity was detected by measuring the trait "weight of  <dig> seeds", for the tested sampling methods. effects on linkage disequilibrium between unlinked microsatellite loci, due to sampling, are discussed.


CONCLUSIONS
building of a thematic core collection was here defined by prior selection of accessions which are diverse for the trait of interest, and then by pairwise genetic distances, estimated by dna polymorphism analysis at molecular marker loci. the resulting thematic core collection potentially reflects the maximum allele richness with the smallest sample size from a larger thematic collection. as an example, we used the development of a thematic core collection for drought tolerance in rice. it is expected that such thematic collections increase the use of germplasm by breeding programs and facilitate the study of the traits under consideration. the definition of a core collection to study drought resistance is a valuable contribution towards the understanding of the genetic control and the physiological mechanisms involved in water use efficiency in plants.
