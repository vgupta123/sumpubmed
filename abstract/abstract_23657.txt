BACKGROUND
targeted disruption of the murine 3β-hydroxysterol-Δ7-reductase gene , an animal model of smith-lemli-opitz syndrome, leads to loss of cholesterol synthesis and neonatal death that can be partially rescued by transgenic replacement of dhcr <dig> expression in brain during embryogenesis. to gain further insight into the role of non-brain tissue cholesterol deficiency in the pathophysiology, we tested whether the lethal phenotype could be abrogated by selective transgenic complementation with dhcr <dig> expression in the liver.


RESULTS
we generated mice that carried a liver-specific human dhcr <dig> transgene whose expression was driven by the human apolipoprotein e  promoter and its associated liver-specific enhancer. these mice were then crossed with dhcr7+/- mutants to generate dhcr7-/- mice bearing a human dhcr <dig> transgene. robust hepatic transgene expression resulted in significant improvement of cholesterol homeostasis with cholesterol concentrations increasing to 80~ <dig> % of normal levels in liver and lung. significantly, cholesterol deficiency in brain was not altered. although late gestational lung sacculation defect reported previously was significantly improved, there was no parallel increase in postnatal survival in the transgenic mutant mice.


CONCLUSIONS
the reconstitution of dhcr <dig> function selectively in liver induced a significant improvement of cholesterol homeostasis in non-brain tissues, but failed to rescue the neonatal lethality of dhcr <dig> null mice. these results provided further evidence that cns defects caused by dhcr <dig> null likely play a major role in the lethal pathogenesis of dhcr7-/- mice, with the peripheral organs contributing the morbidity.
