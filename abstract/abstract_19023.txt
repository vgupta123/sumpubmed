BACKGROUND
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  is a common malignancy worldwide. comprehensive genomic characterization of escc will further our understanding of the carcinogenesis process in this disease.


RESULTS
genome-wide detection of chromosomal changes was performed using the affymetrix genechip  <dig> k single nucleotide polymorphism  array, including loss of heterozygosity  and copy number alterations , for  <dig> pairs of matched germ-line and micro-dissected tumor dna samples. loh regions were identified by two methods – using affymetrix's genotype call software and using affymetrix's copy number alteration tool  software – and both approaches yielded similar results. non-random loh regions were found on  <dig> chromosomal arms , including  <dig> novel loh regions . fifteen cna-loss regions  and  <dig> cna-gain regions  were also identified.


CONCLUSIONS
these studies demonstrate that the affymetrix  <dig> k snp chip is a valid platform to integrate analyses of loh and cna. the comprehensive knowledge gained from this analysis will enable improved strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat escc.
