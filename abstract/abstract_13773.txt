BACKGROUND
the arabidopsis thaliana npr <dig> gene encodes a transcription coactivator  that plays a major role in the mechanisms regulating plant defense response. after pathogen infection and in response to salicylic acid  accumulation, npr <dig> translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where it interacts with other transcription factors resulting in increased expression of over  <dig> plant defense genes contributing to a pathogen resistance response.


RESULTS
a putative theobroma cacao npr <dig> cdna was isolated by rt-pcr using degenerate primers based on homologous sequences from brassica, arabidopsis and carica papaya. the cdna was used to isolate a genomic clone from theobroma cacao containing a putative tcnpr <dig> gene. dna sequencing revealed the presence of a  <dig>  kb coding region containing three introns and encoding a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids. the predicted tcnpr <dig> protein shares 55% identity and 78% similarity to arabidopsis npr <dig>  and contains each of the highly conserved functional domains indicative of this class of transcription factors ). to functionally define the tcnpr <dig> gene, we transferred tcnpr <dig> into an arabidopsis npr <dig> mutant that is highly susceptible to infection by the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  driven by the constitutive camv35s promoter, the cacao tcnpr <dig> gene partially complemented the npr <dig> mutation in transgenic arabidopsis plants, resulting in  <dig> fold less bacterial growth in a leaf infection assay. upon induction with sa, tcnpr <dig> was shown to translocate into the nucleus of leaf and root cells in a manner identical to arabidopsis npr <dig>  cacao npr <dig> was also capable of participating in sa-ja signaling crosstalk, as evidenced by the suppression of ja responsive gene expression in tcnpr <dig> overexpressing transgenic plants.


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that the tcnpr <dig> is a functional ortholog of arabidopsis npr <dig>  and is likely to play a major role in defense response in cacao. this fundamental knowledge can contribute to breeding of disease resistant cacao varieties through the application of molecular markers or the use of transgenic strategies.
