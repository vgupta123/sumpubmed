BACKGROUND
postgenomic transcriptome analyses have identified large numbers of noncoding rnas in mammalian cells. however, the biological function of long ncrnas in mammalian cells remains largely unknown. our recent expression profiling of selected human long ncrnas revealed that a majority were expressed in an organ-specific manner, suggesting their function was linked to specific physiological phenomena in each organ. we investigated the characteristics and function of ncrnas that were specifically expressed in the thymus, the site of t-cell selection and maturation.


RESULTS
expression profiling of  <dig> thymus-specific ncrnas in  <dig> t-cell leukemia cell lines derived from various stages of t-cell maturation revealed that hit <dig> ncrna, named thy-ncr <dig>  was specifically expressed in cell lines derived from stage iii immature t cells in which the neighbouring cd <dig> gene cluster is also specifically activated. the thy-ncr <dig> precursor exhibited complex alternative splicing patterns and differential usage of the 5' terminus leading to the production of an estimated  <dig> isoforms, which were predominantly located in the cytoplasm. selective rnai knockdown of each thy-ncr <dig> isoform demonstrated that microfibril-associated glycoprotein  <dig>  mrna was negatively regulated by two major thy-ncr <dig> isoforms. intriguingly, the mfap <dig> mrna level was controlled by a hupf1-dependent mrna degradation pathway in the cytoplasm distinct from nonsense-mediated decay.


CONCLUSIONS
this study identified thy-ncr <dig> ncrna to be specifically expressed in stage iii immature t cells in which the neighbouring cd <dig> gene cluster was activated. complex alternative splicing produces multiple thy-ncr <dig> isoforms. two major thy-ncr <dig> isoforms are cytoplasmic riboregulators that suppress the expression of mfap <dig> mrna, which is degraded by an uncharacterized hupf1-dependent pathway.
