BACKGROUND
polyhydroxyalkanoates are linear biodegradable polyesters produced by bacteria as a carbon store and used to produce a range of bioplastics. widespread polyhydroxyalkanoate production in c <dig> crops would decrease petroleum dependency by producing a renewable supply of biodegradable plastics along with residual biomass that could be converted into biofuels or energy. increasing yields to commercial levels in biomass crops however remains a challenge. previously, lower accumulation levels of the short side chain polyhydroxyalkanoate, polyhydroxybutyrate , were observed in the chloroplasts of mesophyll  cells compared to bundle sheath  cells in transgenic maize , sugarcane , and switchgrass  leading to a significant decrease in the theoretical yield potential. here we explore various factors which might affect polymer accumulation in mesophyll cells, including targeting of the phb pathway enzymes to the mesophyll plastid and their access to substrate.


RESULTS
the small subunit of rubisco from pea effectively targeted the phb biosynthesis enzymes to both m and bs chloroplasts of sugarcane and switchgrass. phb enzyme activity was retained following targeting to m plastids and was equivalent to that found in the bs plastids. leaf total fatty acid content was not affected by phb production. however, when fatty acid synthesis was chemically inhibited, polymer accumulated in m cells.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we provide evidence that access to substrate and neither poor targeting nor insufficient activity of the phb biosynthetic enzymes may be the limiting factor for polymer production in mesophyll chloroplasts of c <dig> plants.
