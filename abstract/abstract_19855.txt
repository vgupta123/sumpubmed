BACKGROUND
phosphorus  is a major plant nutrient. it is transported into and allocated inside plants by four families of phosphate transporters  with high or low affinity to phosphate. here, we studied whole-plant p uptake kinetics and expression profiles of members of the pht families under high, intermediate and low p availability in the woody crop poplar  in relation to plant performance.


RESULTS
poplars exhibited strong growth reduction and increased p use efficiency in response to lower p availabilities. the relative p uptake rate increased with intermediate and decreased with low p availability. this decrease was not energy-limited because glucose addition could not rescue the uptake. the maximum p uptake rate was more than 13-times higher in p-starved than in well-supplied poplars. the km for whole-root uptake ranged between 26 μm and 20 μm in poplars with intermediate and low p availability, respectively. in well-supplied plants, only low uptake rate was found. the minimum concentration for net p uptake from the nutrient solution was  <dig>  μm. all pht <dig> members studied showed significant up-regulation upon p starvation and were higher expressed in roots than leaves, with the exception of ptpht1; <dig>  ptpht1; <dig> and ptpht1; <dig> showed root- and p starvation-specific expression. various members of the pht <dig>  pht <dig> and pht <dig> families showed higher expression in leaves than in roots, but were unresponsive to p deprivation. other members  exhibited higher expression in roots than in leaves and were in most cases up-regulated in response to p deficiency.


CONCLUSIONS
expression profiles of distinct members of the pht families, especially those of pht <dig> were linked with changes in p uptake and allocation at whole-plant level. the regulation was tissue-specific with lower p responsiveness in leaves than in roots. uptake efficiency for p increased with decreasing p availability, but could not overcome a threshold of about 1 μm p in the nutrient solution. because the p concentrations in soil solutions are generally in the lower micro-molar range, even below the apparent km-values, our findings suggest that bare-rooted poplars are prone to suffer from p limitations in most environments.
