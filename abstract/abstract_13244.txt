BACKGROUND
the ada-dependent adaptive response system in escherichia coli is important for increasing resistance to alkylation damage. however, the global transcriptional and translational changes during this response have not been reported. here we present time-dependent global gene and protein expression profiles following treatment with methyl methanesulfonate  in e. coli w <dig> and its ada mutant strains.


RESULTS
transcriptome profiling showed that  <dig> and  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in response to mms treatment in the wild-type and mutant strains, respectively. a total of  <dig> protein spots representing  <dig> nonredundant proteins differentially expressed were identified using 2-de and lc-ms/ms. in the wild-type strain, many genes were differentially expressed upon long-exposure to mms, due to both adaptive responses and stationary phase responses. in the ada mutant strain, the genes involved in dna replication, recombination, modification and repair were up-regulated  <dig>  h after mms treatment, indicating its connection to the sos and other dna repair systems. interestingly, expression of the genes involved in flagellar biosynthesis, chemotaxis, and two-component regulatory systems related to drug or antibiotic resistance, was found to be controlled by ada.


CONCLUSIONS
these results show in detail the regulatory components and pathways controlling adaptive response and how the related genes including the ada regulon are expressed with this response.
