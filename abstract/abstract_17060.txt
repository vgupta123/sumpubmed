BACKGROUND
many functional proteins have a symmetric structure. most of these are multimeric complexes, which are made of non-symmetric monomers arranged in a symmetric manner. however, there are also a large number of proteins that have a symmetric structure in the monomeric state. these internally symmetric proteins are interesting objects from the point of view of their folding, function, and evolution. most algorithms that detect the internally symmetric proteins depend on finding repeating units of similar structure and do not use the symmetry information.


RESULTS
we describe a new method, called symd, for detecting symmetric protein structures. the symd procedure works by comparing the structure to its own copy after the copy is circularly permuted by all possible number of residues. the procedure is relatively insensitive to symmetry-breaking insertions and deletions and amplifies positive signals from symmetry. it finds 70% to 80% of the tim barrel fold domains in the astral  <dig> domain database and 100% of the beta-propellers as symmetric. more globally, 10% to 15% of the proteins in the astral  <dig> domain database may be considered symmetric according to this procedure depending on the precise cutoff value used to measure the degree of perfection of the symmetry. symmetrical proteins occur in all structural classes and can have a closed, circular structure, a cylindrical barrel-like structure, or an open, helical structure.


CONCLUSIONS
symd is a sensitive procedure for detecting internally symmetric protein structures. using this procedure, we estimate that 10% to 15% of the known protein domains may be considered symmetric. we also report an initial, overall view of the types of symmetries and symmetric folds that occur in the protein domain structure universe.
