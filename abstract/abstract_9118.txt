BACKGROUND
the transcription factor, sox <dig>  is central to the behaviour of neural stem cells. it is also one of the key embryonic stem cell factors that, when overexpressed can convert somatic cells into induced pluripotent cells. although generally studied as a transcriptional activator, recent evidence suggests that it might also repress gene expression.


RESULTS
we show that in neural stem cells sox <dig> represses as many genes as it activates. we found that sox <dig> interacts directly with members of the groucho family of corepressors and that repression of several target genes required this interaction. strikingly, where many of the genes activated by sox <dig> encode transcriptional regulators, no such genes were repressed. finally, we found that a mutant form of sox <dig> that was unable to bind groucho was no longer able to inhibit differentiation of neural stem cells to the same extent as the wild type protein.


CONCLUSIONS
these data reveal a major new mechanism of action for this key transcription factor. in the context of our understanding of endogenous stem cells, this highlights the need to determine how such a central regulator can distinguish which genes to activate and which to repress.
