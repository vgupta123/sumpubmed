BACKGROUND
high concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbon  pollution can be hazardous to human health and leave soils incapable of supporting agricultural crops. a cheap solution, which can help restore biodiversity and bring land back to productivity, is cultivation of high biomass yielding willow trees. however, the genetic mechanisms which allow these fast-growing trees to tolerate phcs are as yet unclear.

methods
salix purpurea ‘fish creek’ trees were pot-grown in soil from a former petroleum refinery, either lacking or enriched with c10-c <dig> phcs. de novo assembled transcriptomes were compared between tree organs and impartially annotated without a priori constraint to any organism.


RESULTS
over 45 % of differentially expressed genes originated from foreign organisms, the majority from the two-spotted spidermite, tetranychus urticae. over 99 % of t.urticae transcripts were differentially expressed with greater abundance in non-contaminated trees. plant transcripts involved in the polypropanoid pathway, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase , had greater expression in contaminated trees whereas most resistance genes showed higher expression in non-contaminated trees.


CONCLUSIONS
the impartial approach to annotation of the de novo transcriptomes, allowing for the possibility for multiple species identification, was essential for interpretation of the crop’s response treatment. the meta-transcriptomic pattern of expression suggests a cross-tolerance mechanism whereby abiotic stress resistance systems provide improved biotic resistance. these findings highlight a valuable but complex biotic and abiotic stress response to real-world, multidimensional contamination which could, in part, help explain why crops such as willow can produce uniquely high biomass yields on challenging marginal land.
