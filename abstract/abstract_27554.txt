BACKGROUND
epigenetic modifications of dna, such as 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethycytosine, play important roles in development and disease. here, we present a cost-effective and versatile methodology for the analysis of dna methylation in targeted genomic regions, which comprises multiplexed, pcr-based preparation of bisulfite dna libraries followed by customized miseq sequencing.


RESULTS
using bisulfite and oxidative bisulfite conversion of dna, we have performed multiplexed targeted sequencing to analyse several kilobases of genomic dna in up to  <dig> samples, and achieved high coverage data of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethycytosine at single-base resolution. our results demonstrate the ability of this methodology to detect all levels of cytosine modifications at greater than 100× coverage in large sample sets at low cost compared to other targeted methods.


CONCLUSIONS
this approach can be applied to multiple settings, from candidate gene to clinical studies, and is especially useful for validation of differentially methylated or hydroxymethylated regions following whole-genome analyses.
