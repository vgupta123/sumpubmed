BACKGROUND
the strictly anaerobic, sulfate-reducing bacterium desulfococcus biacutus can utilize acetone as sole carbon and energy source for growth. whereas in aerobic and nitrate-reducing bacteria acetone is activated by carboxylation with co <dig> to acetoacetate, d. biacutus involves co as a cosubstrate for acetone activation through a different, so far unknown pathway. proteomic studies indicated that, among others, a predicted medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase  superfamily, zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase  is specifically and highly produced during growth with acetone.


RESULTS
the mdr gene debiadraft_ <dig> was cloned and overexpressed in e. coli. the purified recombinant protein required zinc as cofactor, and accepted nadh/nad+ but not nadph/nadp+ as electron donor/acceptor. the ph optimum was at ph  <dig>  and the temperature optimum at 45 °c. highest specific activities were observed for reduction of c <dig> - c5-aldehydes with nadh, such as propanal to propanol , butanal to butanol , and 3-hydroxybutanal to  <dig> -butanediol , however, the enzyme also oxidized 3-hydroxybutanal with nad+ to acetoacetaldehyde .


CONCLUSIONS
the enzyme might play a key role in acetone degradation by d. biacutus, for example as a bifunctional 3-hydroxybutanal dehydrogenase/reductase. its recombinant production may represent an important step in the elucidation of the complete degradation pathway.
