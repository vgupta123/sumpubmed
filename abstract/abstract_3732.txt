BACKGROUND
sumoylation is an important post-translational modification of eukaryotic proteins that involves the reversible conjugation of a small ubiquitin-related modifier  polypeptide to its specific protein substrates, thereby regulating numerous complex cellular processes. the pias  and siz  proteins are sumo e <dig> ligases that modulate sumo conjugation. the characteristic features and sumoylation mechanisms of siz <dig> protein in monocotyledon are poorly understood. here, we examined the functions of a homolog of arabidopsis siz <dig>  a functional siz/pias-type sumo e <dig> ligase from dendrobium.


RESULTS
in dendrobium, the predicted dnsiz <dig> protein has domains that are highly conserved among siz/pias-type proteins. dnsiz <dig> is widely expressed in dendrobium organs and has a up-regulated trend by treatment with cold, high temperature and wounding. the dnsiz <dig> protein localizes to the nucleus and shows sumo e <dig> ligase activity when expressed in an escherichia coli reconstitution system. moreover, ectopic expression of dnsiz <dig> in the arabidopsis siz1- <dig> mutant partially complements several phenotypes and results in enhanced levels of sumo conjugates in plants exposed to heat shock conditions. we observed that dnsiz <dig> acts as a negative regulator of flowering transition which may be via a vernalization-induced pathway. in addition, aba-hypersensitivity of siz1- <dig> seed germination can be partially suppressed by dnsiz <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that dnsiz <dig> is a functional homolog of the arabidopsis siz <dig> with sumo e <dig> ligase activity and may play an important role in the regulation of dendrobium stress responses, flowering and development.
