BACKGROUND
genomic divergence between invasive and native species may provide insight into the molecular basis underlying specific characteristics that drive the invasion and displacement of closely related species. in this study, we sequenced the transcriptome of an indigenous species, asia ii  <dig>  of the bemisia tabaci complex and compared its genetic divergence with the transcriptomes of two invasive whiteflies species, middle east asia minor  <dig>  and mediterranean , respectively.


RESULTS
more than  <dig> million reads of  <dig> base pairs in length were obtained for the asia ii  <dig> species using the illumina sequencing platform. these reads were assembled into  <dig>  distinct sequences  and  <dig>  sequences were annotated with an e-value above 10- <dig>  protein family comparisons revealed obvious diversification among the transcriptomes of these species suggesting species-specific adaptations during whitefly evolution. on the contrary, substantial conservation of the whitefly transcriptomes was also evident, despite their differences. the overall divergence of coding sequences between the orthologous gene pairs of asia ii  <dig> and meam <dig> is  <dig> %, which is comparable to the average divergence of asia ii  <dig> and med transcriptomes  and much higher than that of meam <dig> and med . this is consistent with the previous phylogenetic analyses and crossing experiments suggesting these are distinct species. we also identified hundreds of highly diverged genes and compiled sequence identify data into gene functional groups and found the most divergent gene classes are cytochrome p <dig>  glutathione metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. these results strongly suggest that the divergence of genes related to metabolism might be the driving force of the meam <dig> and asia ii  <dig> differentiation. we also analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms within the orthologous gene pairs of indigenous and invasive whiteflies which are helpful for the investigation of association between allelic and phenotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
our data present the most comprehensive sequences for the indigenous whitefly species asia ii  <dig>  the extensive comparisons of asia ii  <dig>  meam <dig> and med transcriptomes will serve as an invaluable resource for revealing the genetic basis of whitefly invasion and the molecular mechanisms underlying their biological differences.
