BACKGROUND
the neural cell adhesion molecule l <dig> plays a crucial role in development and plasticity of the nervous system. neural cells thus require precise control of l <dig> expression.


RESULTS
we identified a full binding site for nuclear factor i  transcription factors in the regulatory region of the mouse l <dig> gene. electrophoretic mobility shift assay  showed binding of nuclear factor i-a  to this site. moreover, for a brain-specific isoform of nfi-a , we confirmed the interaction in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation . reporter gene assays showed that in neuroblastoma cells, overexpression of nfi-a bs repressed l <dig> expression threefold.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that nfi-a, in particular its brain-specific isoform, represses l <dig> gene expression, and might act as a second silencer of l <dig> in addition to the neural restrictive silencer factor .
