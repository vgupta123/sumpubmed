BACKGROUND
animals utilize a wide variety of tactics to attract reproductive partners. behavioral experiments often indicate an important role for visual cues in fish, but their molecular basis remains almost entirely unknown. studies on model species  allow investigations into this fundamental question in behavioral and evolutionary biology.


RESULTS
through mate-choice experiences using several laboratory strains of various body colors, we successfully identified one medaka mutant  that is distinctly unattractive to reproductive partners. this unattractiveness seems to be due to reduced orange pigment cells  in the skin. the ci strain carries a mutation on the somatolactin alpha  gene, therefore we expected over-expression of sla to make medaka hyper-attractive. indeed, extremely strong mating preferences were detected in a choice between the ci and sla-transgenic  medaka. intriguingly, however, the strains showed opposite biases; that is, the mutant and transgenic medaka liked to mate with partners from their own strain, similar to becoming sexually isolated.


CONCLUSIONS
this study spotlighted sla as a novel mate-choice gene in fish. in addition, these results are the first demonstration of a single gene that can pleiotropically and harmoniously change both secondary sexual characters and mating preferences. although theoretical models have long suggested joint evolution of linked genes on a chromosome, a mutation on a gene-regulatory region  might be sufficient to trigger two 'runaway' processes in different directions to promote  speciation.
