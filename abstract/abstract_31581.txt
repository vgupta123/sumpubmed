BACKGROUND
bibersteinia trehalosi causes respiratory disease in ruminants particularly in wild and domestic sheep. recently, there has been an increased number of b. trehalosi isolates obtained from diagnostic samples from bovine respiratory disease cases. this study evaluated the role of b. trehalosi in bovine respiratory disease using an intra-tracheal inoculation model in calves. thirty six cross bred 2â€“ <dig> month old dairy calves were inoculated intra-tracheally with either leukotoxin negative b. trehalosi, leukotoxin positive b. trehalosi isolate, mannheimia haemolytica, a combination of leukotoxin negative b. trehalosi and m. haemolytica or negative control. calves were euthanized and necropsy performed on day  <dig> of study.


RESULTS
b. trehalosi inoculated calves did not have increased lung involvement compared to control calves. additionally, b. trehalosi was only cultured once from the lungs of inoculated calves at necropsy.


CONCLUSIONS
based on these findings b. trehalosi may not be a primary pathogen of respiratory disease in cattle. culture of b. trehalosi from diagnostic submissions should not be immediately identified as a primary cause of respiratory disease.
