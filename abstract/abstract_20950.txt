BACKGROUND
agaves are succulent monocotyledonous plants native to xeric environments of north america. because of their adaptations to their environment, including crassulacean acid metabolism , and existing technologies for ethanol production, agaves have gained attention both as potential lignocellulosic bioenergy feedstocks and models for exploring plant responses to abiotic stress. however, the lack of comprehensive agave sequence datasets limits the scope of investigations into the molecular-genetic basis of agave traits.


RESULTS
here, we present comprehensive, high quality de novo transcriptome assemblies of two agave species, a. tequilana and a. deserti, built from short-read rna-seq data. our analyses support completeness and accuracy of the de novo transcriptome assemblies, with each species having a minimum of approximately  <dig>  protein-coding genes. comparison of agave proteomes to those of additional plant species identifies biological functions of gene families displaying sequence divergence in agave species. additionally, a focus on the transcriptomics of the a. deserti juvenile leaf confirms evolutionary conservation of monocotyledonous leaf physiology and development along the proximal-distal axis.


CONCLUSIONS
our work presents a comprehensive transcriptome resource for two agave species and provides insight into their biology and physiology. these resources are a foundation for further investigation of agave biology and their improvement for bioenergy development.
