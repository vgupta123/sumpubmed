BACKGROUND
mutations in the x-linked mid <dig> gene are responsible for opitz g/bbb syndrome, a malformation disorder of developing midline structures. previous northern blot analyses revealed the existence of at least three mid <dig> transcripts of differing lengths.


RESULTS
here we show that alternative polyadenylation generates the size differences observed in the northern blot analyses. analysis of est data together with additional northern blot analyses proved tissue-specific usage of the alternative polyadenylation sites. bioinformatic characterization of the different 3'utrs of mid <dig> revealed numerous rna-protein interaction motifs, several of which turned out to be conserved between different species. furthermore, our data suggest that mrna termination at different polyadenylation sites is predetermined by the choice of alternative 5'utrs and promoters of the mid <dig> gene, a mechanism that efficiently allows synergistic function of 5' and 3'utrs.


CONCLUSIONS
mid <dig> expression is tightly regulated through concerted action of alternative promoters and alternative polyadenylation signals both during embryonic development and in the adult.
