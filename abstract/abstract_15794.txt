BACKGROUND
with advances in next generation sequencing technologies and genomic capture techniques, exome sequencing has become a cost-effective approach for mutation detection in genetic diseases. however, computational prediction of copy number variants  from exome sequence data is a challenging task. whilst numerous programs are available, they have different sensitivities, and have low sensitivity to detect smaller cnvs . additionally, exonic cnv discovery using standard acgh has limitations due to the low probe density over exonic regions. the goal of our study was to develop a protocol to detect exonic cnvs , combining computational prediction algorithms and a high-resolution custom cgh array.


RESULTS
we used six published cnv prediction programs  and an in-house modification to exomecopy and exomedepth  for computational cnv prediction on  <dig> exomes from the  <dig> genomes project and  <dig> exomes from primary immunodeficiency patients. cnv predictions were tested using a custom cgh array designed to capture all exons . after this validation, we next evaluated the computational prediction of shorter cnvs. exomecopy and the in-house modified algorithm, excopydepth, showed the highest capability in detecting shorter cnvs. finally, the performance of each computational program was assessed by calculating the sensitivity and false positive rate.


CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we assessed the ability of  <dig> computational programs to predict cnvs, focussing on short  cnvs. we also tested these predictions using a custom array targeting exons. based on these results, we propose a protocol to identify and confirm shorter exonic cnvs combining computational prediction algorithms and custom acgh experiments.
