BACKGROUND
single-cell assays of immune function are increasingly used to monitor t cell responses in immunotherapy clinical trials. standardization and validation of such assays are therefore important to interpretation of the clinical trial data. here we assess the levels of intra-assay, inter-assay, and inter-operator precision, as well as linearity, of cd8+ t cell ifnÎ³-based elispot and cytokine flow cytometry , as well as tetramer assays.


RESULTS
precision was measured in cryopreserved pbmc with a low, medium, or high response level to a cmv pp <dig> peptide or peptide mixture. intra-assay precision was assessed using  <dig> replicates per assay; inter-assay precision was assessed by performing  <dig> assays on different days; and inter-operator precision was assessed using  <dig> different operators working on the same day. percent cv values ranged from 4% to 133% depending upon the assay and response level. linearity was measured by diluting pbmc from a high responder into pbmc from a non-responder, and yielded r <dig> values from  <dig>  to  <dig>  depending upon the assay and antigen.


CONCLUSIONS
these data provide target values for precision and linearity of single-cell assays for those wishing to validate these assays in their own laboratories. they also allow for comparison of the precision and linearity of elispot, cfc, and tetramer across a range of response levels. there was a trend toward tetramer assays showing the highest precision, followed closely by cfc, and then elispot; while all three assays had similar linearity. these findings are contingent upon the use of optimized protocols for each assay.
