BACKGROUND
neuropathic pain is a chronic and intractable symptom associated with nerve injury. the periaqueductal gray  is important in the endogenous pain control system and is the main site of the opioidergic analgesia. to investigate whether neuropathic pain affects the endogenous pain control system, we examined the effect of neuropathic pain induced by sacral nerve transection on presynaptic gaba release, the kinetics of postsynaptic gaba-activated cl- currents, and the modulatory effect of Î¼-opioid receptor  activation in mechanically isolated pag neurons with functioning synaptic boutons.


RESULTS
in normal rats, mor activation inhibited the frequency of gabaergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents  to  <dig> % of the control without any alteration in their amplitude. in neuropathic rats, the inhibition of mipsc frequency by mor activation was  <dig> %. the frequency of gabaergic mipscs in neuropathic rats was  <dig> % of normal rats without any difference in the mipsc amplitude. analysis of mipsc kinetics showed that the fast decay time constant and synaptic charge transfer of mipscs in neuropathic rats were  <dig> % and  <dig> % of normal rats, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that although the inhibitory effect of mor activation on presynaptic gaba release is similar in both neuropathic and normal rats, neuropathic pain may inhibit endogenous analgesia in the pag through an increase in presynaptic gaba release.
