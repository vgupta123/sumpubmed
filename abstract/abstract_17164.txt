BACKGROUND
the major histocompatibility complex  genes are vital partners in the acquired immune processes of vertebrates. mhc diversity may be directly associated with population resistance to infectious pathogens. here, we screened for polymorphisms in exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the ia <dig> and ia <dig> genes in  <dig> golden pheasant populations across the chinese mainland to characterize their genetic variation levels, to understand the effects of historical positive selection and recombination in shaping class i diversity, and to investigate the genetic structure of wild golden pheasant populations.


RESULTS
among  <dig> individual pheasants, we identified  <dig> ia <dig> alleles in exon  <dig> ,  <dig> ia1-e <dig> alleles,  <dig> ia2-e <dig> alleles, and  <dig> ia2-e <dig> alleles. the non-synonymous substitution rate was significantly greater than the synonymous substitution rate at sequences in the ia <dig> gene encoding putative peptide-binding sites but not in the ia <dig> gene; we also found more positively selected sites in ia <dig> than in ia <dig>  frequent recombination events resulted in at least  <dig> recombinant ia <dig> alleles, in accordance with the intermingling pattern of the phylogenetic tree. although some ia alleles are widely shared among studied populations, large variation occurs in the number of ia alleles across these populations. allele frequency analysis across  <dig> ia loci showed low levels of genetic differentiation among populations on small geographic scales; however, significant genetic differentiation was observed between pheasants from the northern and southern regions of the yangtze river. both structure analysis and f-statistic  value comparison classified those populations into  <dig> major groups: the northern region of the yangtze river  and the southern region of the yangtze river .


CONCLUSIONS
more extensive polymorphisms in ia <dig> than ia <dig> indicate that ia <dig> has undergone much stronger positive-selection pressure during evolution. moreover, the recombination events detected between the genes and the intermingled phylogenetic pattern indicate that interlocus recombination accounts for much of the allelic variation in ia <dig>  analysis of the population differentiation implied that homogenous balancing selection plays an important part in maintaining an even distribution of mhc variations. the natural barrier of the yangtze river and heterogeneous balancing selection might help shape the nyr-syr genetic structure in golden pheasants.
