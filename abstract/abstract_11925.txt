BACKGROUND
in order to provide some basis for effective dosage regimens that optimize efficacy with respect to bacteriological and clinical cures, the in vivo activity of cefquinome against a clinical escherichia coli  strain  was investigated by using a piglet tissue-cage infection model. the aim was to elucidate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics  index associated with cefquinome efficacy, and then to identify the magnitude of the pk/pd parameter required for different degree of efficacy in clinical treatment.


RESULTS
tissue-cage infection model was established in piglets, and then the animals received intramuscular injection of cefquinome twice a day for 3 days to create a range of different drug exposures. the tissue-cage fluid was collected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 12 h after every drug administration for drug concentration determination and bacteria counting. different cefquinome regimens produced different percentages of time during that drug concentrations exceeded the mic , ranging from 0 % to 100 %. cefquinome administration at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> and 4 mg/kg reduced the bacterial count  in tissue-cage fluid by − <dig>  ±  <dig> , − <dig>  ±  <dig> , − <dig>  ±  <dig> , − <dig>  ±  <dig> , − <dig>  ±  <dig> , − <dig>  ±  <dig> , − <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. the correlation coefficient of the pk/pd index with antibacterial effect of the drug was  <dig>  for %t > mic,  <dig>  for auc0–12/mic, and  <dig>  for cmax/mic, suggesting the most important pk/pd parameter was %t > mic. a inhibitory form of sigmoid maximum effect  model was used to estimate %t > mic, and the respective values required for continuous 1/6-log drop, 1/3-log drop and 1/2-log drop of the clinical e.coli count during each 12 h treatment period were  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %.


CONCLUSIONS
the data derived from this study showed that cefquinome exhibited time-dependent killing profile. and from the results of the present study, it can be assumed that when %t > mic reached  <dig>  %, cefquinome could be expected to be effective against a clinical e.coli strain for which the mic value is below  <dig>  μg/ml .
