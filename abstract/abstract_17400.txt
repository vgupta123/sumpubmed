BACKGROUND
most of the proteins contained in royal jelly  are secreted from the hypopharyngeal glands  of young bees. although generic protein composition of rj has been investigated, little is known about how age-dependent changes on hg secretion affect rj composition and their biological consequences. in this study, we identified differentially expressed proteins  during hg development by using the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification  labeling technique. this proteomic method increases the potential for new protein discovery by improving the identification of low quantity proteins.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> proteins were identified from five age groups of worker bees,  <dig> of which were differentially expressed.  <dig>  of the deps were identified for the first time. comparison of samples at day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of development relative to day  <dig> led to the unambiguous identification of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> deps, respectively. the majority of these deps were up-regulated in the older worker groups, indicating a substantial change in the pattern of proteins expressed after  <dig> days. deps were identified among all the age groups, suggesting that changes in protein expression during hg ontogeny are concomitant with different states of worker development. a total of  <dig> proteins were mapped to canonical signaling pathways found in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes , which were preferentially associated with metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. more than  <dig> key high-abundance proteins were involved in signaling pathways related to ribosome function and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. the results were validated by qpcr.


CONCLUSIONS
our approach demonstrates that hg experienced important changes in protein expression during its ontogenic development, which supports the secretion of proteins involved in diverse functions in adult workers beyond its traditional role in royal jelly production.
