BACKGROUND
the kelch repeat protein muskelin mediates cytoskeletal responses to the extracellular matrix protein thrombospondin  <dig>  , that is known to promote synaptogenesis in the central nervous system . muskelin displays intracellular localization and affects cytoskeletal organization in adherent cells. muskelin is expressed in adult brain and has been reported to bind the cdk <dig> activator p <dig>  which also facilitates the formation of functional synapses. since little is known about muskelin in neuronal tissues, we here analysed the tissue distribution of muskelin in rodent brain and analysed its subcellular localization using cultured neurons from multiple life stages.


RESULTS
our data show that muskelin transcripts and polypeptides are expressed throughout the central nervous system with significantly high levels in hippocampus and cerebellum, a finding that resembles the tissue distribution of p <dig>  at the subcellular level, muskelin is found in the soma, in neurite projections and the nucleus with a punctate distribution in both axons and dendrites. immunostaining and synaptosome preparations identify partial localization of muskelin at synaptic sites. differential centrifugation further reveals muskelin in membrane-enriched, rather than cytosolic fractions.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that muskelin represents a multifunctional protein associated with membranes and/or large protein complexes in most neurons of the central nervous system. these data are in conclusion with distinct roles of muskelin's functional interaction partners.
