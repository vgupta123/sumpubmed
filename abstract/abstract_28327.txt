BACKGROUND
dendritic spines represent the postsynaptic component of the vast majority of excitatory synapses present in the mammalian forebrain. the ability of spines to rapidly alter their shape, size, number and receptor content in response to stimulation is considered to be of paramount importance during the development of synaptic plasticity. indeed, long-term potentiation , widely believed to be a cellular correlate of learning and memory, has been repeatedly shown to induce both spine enlargement and the formation of new dendritic spines. in our studies, we focus on kalirin- <dig> , a rho gdp/gtp exchange factor  localized to the postsynaptic density that plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of dendritic spines both in vitro and in vivo. previous studies have shown that mice lacking kal <dig>  have decreased dendritic spine density in the hippocampus as well as focal hippocampal-dependent learning impairments.


RESULTS
we have performed a detailed electrophysiological characterization of the role of kal <dig> in hippocampal synaptic plasticity. we show that loss of kal <dig> results in impaired nmda receptor-dependent ltp and long-term depression, whereas a nmda receptor-independent form of ltp is shown to be normal in the absence of kal <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that kal <dig> is an essential and selective modulator of nmda receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.
