BACKGROUND
sheep poxvirus , goat poxvirus  and lumpy skin disease virus  are the most serious poxviruses of ruminants. they are double stranded dna viruses of the genus capripoxvirus,  within the family poxviridae. the aim of this study was to develop a loop-mediated isothermal amplification  assay for the detection of capripoxvirus  dna.


RESULTS
a single lamp assay targeting a conserved region of the capv p <dig> gene was selected from  <dig> pilot lamp assays and optimised by adding loop primers to accelerate the reaction time. this lamp assay successfully detected dna prepared from representative capv isolates , and did not cross-react with dna extracted from other mammalian poxviruses. the analytical sensitivity of the lamp assay was determined to be at least  <dig> dna copies/Î¼l which is equivalent to the performance reported for diagnostic real-time pcr currently used for the detection of capv. lamp reactions were monitored with an intercalating dye using a real-time pcr machine, or by agarose-gel electrophoresis. furthermore, dual labelled lamp products  could be readily visualised using a lateral-flow device.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a simple and rapid approach to detect capv dna that may have utility for use in the field, or in non-specialised laboratories where expensive equipment is not available.
