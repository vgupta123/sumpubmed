BACKGROUND
patients infected with vibrio vulnificus  show severe inflammatory responses characterised by the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. macrophage migration inhibitory factor , an upstream proinflammatory regulator, increases the inflammation caused by sepsis. whether mif regulates responses to v. vulnificus infection and the actual mechanism by which v. vulnificus initiates these mif-modulated proinflammatory cytokines remain unclear.


RESULTS
mif increased inflammation during v. vulnificus infection in vivo. in v. vulnificus-infected mice, mif was produced earlier than tumour necrosis factor -α and interleukin - <dig> and was expressed in a time-dependent manner. iso- <dig> -3-- <dig> -dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl ester), a small-molecule inhibitor of mif, significantly decreased il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α production in a time- and dose-dependent manner in human peripheral blood cells infected with v. vulnificus. the induction of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α production by v. vulnificus infection was mediated via the nf-κb- and p <dig> mapk-regulated pathways but not via the akt pathway. iso-1-treated human peripheral blood cells showed lower v. vulnificus-induced nf-κb activation, il- <dig> mrna expression, and iκb phosphorylation, but they did not show lower p <dig> mapk activation.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that mif regulates v. vulnificus-induced il- <dig> production via nf-κb activation and that p <dig> mapk activation in v. vulnificus infection is not mif dependent.
