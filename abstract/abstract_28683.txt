BACKGROUND
myocyte stress  <dig>  is a striated muscle actin binding protein required for the muscle specific activity of the evolutionary ancient myocardin related transcription factor /serum response factor  transcriptional pathway. to date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that govern skeletal muscle specific expression of ms <dig>  such mechanisms are likely to play a major role in modulating srf activity and therefore muscle determination, differentiation and regeneration. in this study we employed a comparative in silico analysis coupled with an experimental promoter characterisation to delineate these mechanisms.


RESULTS
analysis of ms <dig> expression in differentiating c2c <dig> muscle cells demonstrated a temporal differentiation dependent up-regulation in ms <dig> mrna. an in silico comparative sequence analysis identified two conserved putative myogenic regulatory domains within the proximal  <dig>  kbp of 5' upstream sequence. co-transfecting c2c <dig> myoblasts with ms <dig> promoter/luciferase reporters and myogenic regulatory factor  over-expression plasmids revealed specific sensitivity of the ms <dig> promoter to myod. subsequent mutagenesis and emsa analysis demonstrated specific targeting of myod at two distinct e-boxes  within identified evolutionary conserved regions . chromatin immunoprecipitation  analysis indicates that co-ordinated binding of myod at e-boxes located within ecrs α and β correlates with the temporal induction in ms <dig> mrna.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that the tissue specific and differentiation dependent up-regulation in ms <dig> mrna is mediated by temporal binding of myod at distinct evolutionary conserved e-boxes within the ms <dig> 5' upstream sequence. we believe, through its activation of ms <dig>  this is the first study to demonstrate a direct link between myod activity and srf transcriptional signalling, with clear implications for the understanding of muscle determination, differentiation and regeneration.
