BACKGROUND
gene therapy could provide an effective treatment of diabetes. previous studies have investigated the potential for several cell and tissue types to produce mature and active insulin. gut k and l-cells could be potential candidate hosts for gene therapy because of their special features.


RESULTS
in this study, we isolated gut k and l-cells to compare the potential of both cell types to produce insulin when exposed to similar conditions. the isolated pure k and l-cells were transfected with recombinant plasmids encoding insulin and with specific promoters for k or l-cells. insulin expression was studied in response to glucose or meat hydrolysate. we found that glucose and meat hydrolysate efficiently induced insulin secretion from k and l-cells. however, the effects of meat hydrolysate on insulin secretion were more potent in both cells compared with glucose. results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays showed that l-cells secreted more insulin compared with k-cells regardless of the stimulator, although this difference was not statistically significant.


CONCLUSIONS
the responses of k and l-cells to stimulation with glucose or meat hydrolysate were generally comparable. therefore, both k and l-cells show similar potential to be used as surrogate cells for insulin gene expression in vitro. the potential use of these cells for diabetic gene therapy warrants further investigation.
