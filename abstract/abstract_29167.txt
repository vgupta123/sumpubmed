BACKGROUND
sequencing of cdna libraries for the development of expressed sequence tags  as well as for the discovery of simple sequence repeats  has been a common method of developing microsatellites or ssr-based markers. in this research, our objective was to further sequence and develop common bean microsatellites from leaf and root cdna libraries derived from the andean gene pool accession g <dig> and the mesoamerican gene pool accession dor <dig>  mapping parents of a commonly used reference map. the root libraries were made from high and low phosphorus treated plants.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  est sequences from leaf and root cdna libraries were screened and used for direct simple sequence repeat discovery. from these est sequences we found  <dig> microsatellites; the majority containing tri-nucleotide motifs, many of which were gc rich . di-nucleotide motif microsatellites were about half as common as the tri-nucleotide motif microsatellites but most of these were agn microsatellites with a moderate number of atn microsatellites in root ests followed by few acn and no gcn microsatellites. out of the  <dig> new ssr loci,  <dig> new microsatellite markers were developed in the bmc  series and these were evaluated for their capacity to distinguish bean diversity in a germplasm panel of  <dig> genotypes. we developed a database with images of the microsatellites and their polymorphism information content , which averaged  <dig>  for polymorphic markers.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study produced information about microsatellite frequency in root and leaf tissues of two important genotypes for common bean genomics: namely g <dig>  the andean genotype selected for whole genome shotgun sequencing from race peru, and dor <dig> a race mesoamerica subgroup  <dig> genotype that is a small-red seeded, released variety in central america. both race peru and mesoamerica subgroup  <dig>  have been understudied in comparison to race nueva granada and mesoamerica subgroup  <dig>  both with regards to gene expression and as sources of markers. however, we found few differences between ssr type and frequency between the g <dig> leaf and dor <dig> root tissue-derived ests. overall, our work adds to the analysis of microsatellite frequency evaluation for common bean and provides a new set of  <dig> bmc markers which combined with the  <dig> previously developed bmc markers brings the total in this series to  <dig> markers. once we include bmd markers, which are derived from genbank sequences, the current total of gene-based markers from our laboratory surpasses  <dig> markers. these markers are basic for studies of the transcriptome of common bean and can form anchor points for genetic mapping studies in the future.
