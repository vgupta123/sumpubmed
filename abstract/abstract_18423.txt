BACKGROUND
alfalfa, , a widely-grown perennial forage has potential for development as a cellulosic ethanol feedstock. however, the genomics of alfalfa, a non-model species, is still in its infancy. the recent advent of rna-seq, a massively parallel sequencing method for transcriptome analysis, provides an opportunity to expand the identification of alfalfa genes and polymorphisms, and conduct in-depth transcript profiling.


RESULTS
cell walls in stems of alfalfa genotype  <dig> have higher cellulose and lower lignin concentrations compared to cell walls in stems of genotype  <dig>  using the illumina ga-ii platform, a total of  <dig> , <dig> expression sequence tags  were generated from cdna libraries derived from elongating stem  and post-elongation stem  internodes of  <dig> and  <dig>  in addition,  <dig>  ests were generated from es and pes internodes of genotype  <dig> using the gs flx titanium platform. the first alfalfa  gene index  was assembled using the sanger ests available from genbank, the gs flx titanium est sequences, and the de novo assembled illumina sequences. msgi  <dig>  contains  <dig>  unique sequences including  <dig>  tentative consensus sequences ,  <dig>  singletons and  <dig>  pseudo-singletons. we identified a total of  <dig>  simple sequence repeats  among the sequences in msgi  <dig> . in addition, a total of  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  were predicted between the two genotypes. out of  <dig> snps randomly selected for experimental validation,  <dig>  were polymorphic between the two genotypes. we also identified numerous allelic variations within each genotype. digital gene expression analysis identified numerous candidate genes that may play a role in stem development as well as candidate genes that may contribute to the differences in cell wall composition in stems of the two genotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that rna-seq can be successfully used for gene identification, polymorphism detection and transcript profiling in alfalfa, a non-model, allogamous, autotetraploid species. the alfalfa gene index assembled in this study, and the snps, ssrs and candidate genes identified can be used to improve alfalfa as a forage crop and cellulosic feedstock.
