BACKGROUND
chip-seq, which combines chromatin immunoprecipitation  with high-throughput massively parallel sequencing, is increasingly being used for identification of protein-dna interactions in vivo in the genome. however, to maximize the effectiveness of data analysis of such sequences requires the development of new algorithms that are able to accurately predict dna-protein binding sites.


RESULTS
here, we present sipes , a novel algorithm for precise identification of binding sites from short reads generated by paired-end solexa chip-seq technology. in this paper we used chip-seq data from the arabidopsis basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor aborted microspores , which is expressed within the anther during pollen development, the results show that sipes has better resolution for binding site identification compared to two existing chip-seq peak detection algorithms, cisgenome and macs.


CONCLUSIONS
when compared to cisgenome and macs, sipes shows better resolution for binding site discovery. moreover, sipes is designed to calculate the mappable genome length accurately with the fragment length based on the paired-end reads. dynamic baselines are also employed to effectively discriminate closely adjacent binding sites, for effective binding sites discovery, which is of particular value when working with high-density genomes.
