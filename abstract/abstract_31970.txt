BACKGROUND
a detailed analysis of whole genomes can be now achieved with next generation sequencing. epstein barr virus  transformation is a widely used strategy in clinical research to obtain an unlimited source of a subjectâ€™s dna. although the mechanism of transformation and immortalization by ebv is relatively well known at the transcriptional and proteomic level, the genetic consequences of ebv transformation are less well understood. a detailed analysis of the genetic alterations introduced by ebv transformation is highly relevant, as it will inform on the usefulness and limitations of this approach.


RESULTS
we used whole genome sequencing to assess the genomic signature of a low-passage lymphoblastoid cell line . specifically, we sequenced the full genome  of an individual using dna purified from fresh whole blood as well as dna from his lcl. a total of  <dig>  gb of sequence were generated from the cell line and  <dig>  gb from the normal genomic dna. we determined with high confidence that  <dig> % of the genomes were identical, with no reproducible changes in structural variation  or insertion/deletion polymorphisms .


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that, at this level of resolution, the lcl is genetically indistinguishable from its genomic counterpart and therefore their use in clinical research is not likely to introduce a significant bias.
