BACKGROUND
the pim family genes encode oncogenic serine/threonine kinases which in hematopoietic cells have been implicated in cytokine-dependent signaling as well as in lymphomagenesis, especially in cooperation with other oncogenes such as myc, bcl- <dig> or runx family genes. the runx genes encode Î±-subunits of heterodimeric transcription factors which regulate cell proliferation and differentiation in various tissues during development and which can become leukemogenic upon aberrant expression.


RESULTS
here we have identified novel protein-protein interactions between the pim- <dig> kinase and the runx family transcription factors. using the yeast two-hybrid system, we were able to show that the c-terminal part of human runx <dig> associates with pim- <dig>  this result was confirmed in cell culture, where full-length murine runx <dig> and runx <dig> both coprecipitated and colocalized with pim- <dig>  furthermore, catalytically active pim- <dig> kinase was able to phosphorylate runx <dig> and runx <dig> proteins and enhance the transactivation activity of runx <dig> in a dose-dependent fashion.


CONCLUSIONS
altogether, our results suggest that mammalian runx family transcription factors are novel binding partners and substrates for the pim- <dig> kinase, which may be able to regulate their activities during normal hematopoiesis as well as in leukemogenesis.
