BACKGROUND
chromatin insulators or boundary elements are a class of functional elements in the eukaryotic genome. they regulate gene transcription by interfering with promoter-enhancer communication. the cp <dig> protein of drosophila melanogaster is essential to the function of at least three-types of chromatin insulator complexes organized by su, ctcf and beaf <dig> 


RESULTS
we mapped functional regions of cp <dig> in vivo and identified three domains that are essential for the insulator function and for the viability of flies: the btb/poz domain, an aspartic acid-rich  region and a c-terminal glutamic acid-rich  region. other domains including the centrosomal targeting domain and the zinc fingers are dispensable. the n-terminal cp190btb-d fragment containing the btb/poz domain and the d-rich region is sufficient to mediate association with all three types of insulator complexes. the fragment however is not sufficient for insulator activity or viability. the cp <dig> and cp190btb-d are regulated differently in cells treated with heat-shock. the cp <dig> dissociated from chromosomes during heat-shock, indicating that dissociation of cp <dig> with chromosomes can be regulated. in contrast, the cp190btb-d fragment didn't dissociate from chromosomes in the same heat-shocked condition, suggesting that the deleted c-terminal regions have a role in regulating the dissociation of cp <dig> with chromosomes.


CONCLUSIONS
the n-terminal fragment of cp <dig> containing the btb/poz domain and the d-rich region mediates association of cp <dig> with all three types of insulator complexes and that the e-rich region of cp <dig> is required for dissociation of cp <dig> from chromosomes during heat-shock. the heat-shock-induced dissociation is strong evidence indicating that dissociation of the essential insulator protein cp <dig> from chromosomes is regulated. our results provide a mechanism through which activities of an insulator can be modulated by internal and external cues.
