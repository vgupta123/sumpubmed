BACKGROUND
gcn <dig> belongs to a family of histone acetyltransferases  that regulate protein function by acetylation. gcn <dig> plays several different roles in gene transcription throughout the genome but their characterisation by classical mutation approaches is hampered by the high degree of apparent functional redundancy between hat proteins.


RESULTS
here we utilise the reduced redundancy associated with the transiently high levels of genomic reprogramming during stress adaptation as a complementary approach to understand the functions of redundant protein families like hats. we show genome-wide evidence for two functionally distinct roles of gcn <dig>  first, gcn <dig> transiently re-localises to the orfs of long genes during stress adaptation. taken together with earlier mechanistic studies, our data suggests that gcn <dig> plays a genome- wide role in specifically increasing the transcriptional elongation of long genes, thus increasing the production efficiency of complete long transcripts. second, we suggest that gcn <dig> transiently interacts with histones close to the transcription start site of the many genes that it activates during stress adaptation by acetylation of histone h3k <dig>  leading to histone depletion, probably as a result of nucleosome loss as has been described previously.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that stress adaptation can be used to elucidate the functions of otherwise redundant proteins, like gcn <dig>  in gene transcription. further, we show that normalization of chromatin-associated protein levels in chip experiments in relation to the histone levels may provide a useful complement to standard approaches. in the present study analysis of data in this way provides an alternative explanation for previously indicated repressive role of gcn <dig> in gene transcription.
