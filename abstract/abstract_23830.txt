BACKGROUND
during the fourth larval  stage, vulval cells of c. elegans undergo extensive morphogenesis accompanied by changes in gene expression. this phase of vulval development, occurring after the well-studied induction of vulval cells, is not well understood but is potentially a useful context in which to study how a complex temporal sequence of events is regulated during development. however, a system for precisely describing different phases of vulval development in the l <dig> stage has been lacking.


RESULTS
we defined ten sub-stages of l <dig> based on morphological criteria as observed using nomarski microscopy . precise timing of each sub-stage at 20 °c was determined. we also re-examined the timing of expression for several gene expression markers, and correlated the sub-stages with the timing of other developmental events in the vulva and the uterus.


CONCLUSIONS
this scheme allows the developmental timing of an l <dig> individual to be determined at approximately one-hour resolution without the need to resort to time course experiments. these well-defined developmental stages will enable more precise description of gene expression and other developmental events.
