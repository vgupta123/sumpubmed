BACKGROUND
the 14-3- <dig>  proteins are highly conserved in higher eukaryotes, participate in various cellular signaling pathways including cell cycle regulation, development and growth. our previous studies demonstrated that 14-3-3ε  is responsible for maintaining prophase | arrest in mouse oocyte. however, roles of 14-3-3ε in the mitosis of fertilized mouse eggs have remained unclear. here, we showed that 14-3-3ε interacts and cooperates with cdc25b phosphorylated at ser <dig> regulating g2/m transition of mitotic progress of fertilized mouse eggs.


RESULTS
disruption of 14-3-3ε expression by rnai prevented normal g2/m transition by inhibition of mpf activity and leaded to the translocation of cdc25b into the nucleus from the cytoplasm. overexpression of 14-3-3ε-wt and unphosphorylatable cdc25b mutant  induced mitotic resumption in dbcamp-arrested eggs. in addition, we examined endogenous and exogenous distribution of 14-3-3ε and cdc25b. endogenous 14-3-3ε and cdc25b were co-localized primarily in the cytoplasm at the g <dig>  s, early g <dig> and m phases whereas cdc25b was found to accumulate in the nucleus at the late g <dig> phase. upon coexpression with rfp–14-3-3ε, gfp–cdc25b–wt and gfp–cdc25b–s321a were predominantly cytoplasmic at early g <dig> phase and then gfp–cdc25b–s321a moved to the nucleus whereas cdc25b-wt signals were observed in the cytoplasm without nucleus accumulation at late g <dig> phase at presence of dbcamp.


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that 14-3-3ε is required for the mitotic entry in the fertilized mouse eggs. 14-3-3ε is primarily responsible for sequestering the cdc25b in cytoplasm and 14-3-3ε binding to cdc25b-s <dig> phosphorylated by pka induces mitotic arrest at one-cell stage by inactivation of mpf in fertilized mouse eggs.
