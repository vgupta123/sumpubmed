BACKGROUND
escherichia coli have been found in increased numbers in tissues from patients with inflammatory bowel disease  and adherent-invasive e. coli have been found in resected ileum from patients with crohn's disesae. this study aimed to characterize possible differences in phylogenetic group , extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli  genes and multilocus sequence type  between e. coli strains isolated from ibd patients with past or present involvement of the left side of the colon and from controls.


RESULTS
fecal samples were collected from  <dig> patients and from  <dig> healthy controls. disease activity was evaluated by sigmoidoscopy. interestingly, e. coli strains of the phylogenetic group b <dig> were cultured from 60% of patients with ibd compared to 11% of healthy controls . furthermore, when comparing the number of e. coli b <dig> strains with at least one positive expec gene among different groups, 86% were found positive among active ibd patients, significantly more than 13% among inactive ibd patients , and 11% among healthy controls . the b <dig> phylogenetic group was found in a specific cluster based on mlst, but no further separation between e. coli strains associated with active compared to inactive ibd was achieved.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, e. coli of the phylogenetic group b <dig> were isolated more frequently from ibd patients with past or present involvement of the left side of the colon compared to healthy controls, and b <dig> strains with expec genes were found more frequently among ibd patients with active disease compared to patients with inactive disease.
