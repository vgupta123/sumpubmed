BACKGROUND
glutamergic excitotoxicity has been shown to play a deleterious role in the pathophysiology of spinal cord injury . the aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of dizocilpine maleate, mk <dig>  in a mice model of sci. the spinal cord trauma was induced by the application of vascular clips to the dura via a four-level t5-t <dig> laminectomy.


RESULTS
spinal cord injury in mice resulted in severe trauma characterized by edema, neutrophil infiltration and apoptosis. in this study we clearly demonstrated that administration of mk <dig> attenuated all inflammatory parameters. in fact  <dig> hours after injury, the degree of spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury , infiltration of neutrophils, nf-Îºb activation, inos, cytokines levels , neurotrophin expression were markedly reduced by mk <dig> treatment. moreover, in a separate set of experiments, we have demonstrated that mk <dig> treatment significantly improved the recovery of locomotory function.


CONCLUSIONS
blockade of nmda by mk <dig> lends support to the potential importance of nmda antagonists as therapeutic agents in the treatment of acute spinal cord injury.
