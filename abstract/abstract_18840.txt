BACKGROUND
aquaculture is the quickest growing sector in agriculture. however, qtl for important traits have been only identified in a few aquaculture species. we conducted qtl mapping for growth traits in an asian seabass f <dig> family with  <dig> individuals using  <dig> microsatellites and  <dig> snps, and performed association mapping in four populations with  <dig> individuals.


RESULTS
twelve and nine significant qtl, as well as  <dig> and  <dig> suggestive qtl were detected for growth traits at six and nine months post hatch, respectively. these qtl explained  <dig> - <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. for body weight, two qtl intervals at two stages were overlapped while the others were mapped onto different positions. the ifabp-a gene located in a significant qtl interval for growth on lg <dig> was cloned and characterized. a snp in exon  <dig> of the gene was significantly associated with growth traits in different populations.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of qtl mapping for growth traits suggest that growth at different stages was controlled by some common qtl and some different qtl. positional candidate genes and association mapping suggest that the ifabp-a is a strong candidate gene for growth. our data supply a basis for fine mapping qtl, marker-assisted selection and further detailed analysis of the functions of the ifabp-a gene in fish growth.
