BACKGROUND
microrna  directed gene repression is an important mechanism of posttranscriptional regulation. comprehensive analyses of how microrna influence biological processes requires paired mirna-mrna expression datasets. however, a review of both geo and arrayexpress repositories revealed few such datasets, which was in stark contrast to the large number of messenger rna  only datasets. it is of interest that numerous primary mirnas  are known to be co-expressed with coding genes .


RESULTS
we developed a mirna-mrna interaction analyses pipeline. the proposed solution is based on two mirna expression prediction methods – a scaling function and a linear model. additionally, mirna-mrna anti-correlation analyses are used to determine the most probable mirna gene targets . both the consistency and accuracy of the prediction method is ensured by the application of stringent statistical methods. finally, the predicted targets are subjected to functional enrichment analyses including go, kegg and do, to better understand the predicted interactions.


CONCLUSIONS
the mmpred pipeline requires only mrna expression data as input and is independent of third party mirna target prediction methods. the method passed extensive numerical validation based on the binding energy between the mature mirna and 3’ utr region of the target gene. we report that mmpred is capable of generating results similar to that obtained using paired datasets. for the reported test cases we generated consistent output and predicted biological relationships that will help formulate further testable hypotheses.
