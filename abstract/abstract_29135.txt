BACKGROUND
the epidemiology of new neonatal porcine diarrhoea syndrome  was studied in four selected herds. a total of  <dig> new born piglets in  <dig> litters were evaluated for five consecutive days. nnpds is a newly emerged syndrome, characterized by diarrhoea within the first week of life, which is un-responsive to antibiotics and not associated with known pathogens. the aetiology behind the syndrome is unknown, and specific risk factors predisposing piglets to develop nnpds also remain to be determined.

the study evaluated sow and piglet-level risk factors for developing nnpds and described the epidemiologic characteristics within four herds previously diagnosed with the syndrome. nnpds was defined as diarrhoea at any time-point during the second to fifth day of life.


RESULTS
nnpds was observed in a total of 60%  of first parity piglets and 36%  of piglets born by mature sows. in total of 26% of piglets had liquid faeces on the day of birth. approximately half of these piglets developed nnpds. in the majority of cases  symptoms started on the second or third day of life. piglets in herd  <dig> had <dig>  times higher probability of developing nnpds than piglets in herd  <dig>  first parity piglets had a  <dig>  higher probability of developing nnpds than piglets born by mature sows. birth weight and faecal consistency on the day of birth were minor risk factors, each significant within one herd.


CONCLUSIONS
the most important factors associated with nnpds were herd of origin and sow-parity. the reason for one of the herds experiencing a considerably more severe outbreak than the others was not explained by factors addressed in this study.

the epidemiological pattern of diarrhoea varied a lot between herds; however, in all herds first parity piglets seemed predisposed. this association may be explained by an infectious background of the syndrome, but further studies are needed to explain this association.
