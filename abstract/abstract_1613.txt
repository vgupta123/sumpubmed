BACKGROUND
guenons  are a species-rich group of primates that have attracted considerable attention from both primatologists and evolutionary biologists. the complex speciation pattern has made the elucidation of their relationships a challenging task, and many questions remain unanswered. sines are a class of non-autonomous mobile elements and are essentially homoplasy-free characters with known ancestral states, making them useful genetic markers for phylogenetic studies.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> novel alu insertion loci from  <dig> species of tribe cercopithecini, and used these insertions and  <dig> previously reported loci to infer a phylogenetic tree of the tribe cercopithecini. our results robustly supported the following relationships:  allenopithecus is the basal lineage within the tribe;  cercopithecus lhoesti  forms a clade with chlorocebus aethiops  and erythrocebus patas , supporting a single arboreal to terrestrial transition within the tribe;  all of the cercopithecus except c. lhoesti form a monophyletic group; and  contrary to the common belief that miopithecus is one of the most basal lineages in the tribe, m. talapoin  forms a clade with arboreal members of cercopithecus, and the terrestrial group  diverged from this clade after the divergence of allenopithecus. some incongruent loci were found among the relationships within the arboreal cercopithecus group. several factors, including incomplete lineage sorting, concurrent polymorphism and hybridization between species may have contributed to the incongruence.


CONCLUSIONS
this study presents one of the most robust phylogenetic hypotheses for the tribe cercopithecini and demonstrates the advantages of sine insertions for phylogenetic studies.
