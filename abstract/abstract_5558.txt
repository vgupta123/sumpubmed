BACKGROUND
mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis , the causative agent of johne's disease  persistently infects and survives within the host macrophages. while it is established that substantial genotypic variation exists among map, evidence for the correlates that associate specific map genotypes with clinical or sub-clinical disease phenotypes is presently unknown. thus we studied strain differences in intracellular map survival and host responses in a bovine monocyte derived macrophage  system.


RESULTS
intracellular survival studies showed that a bovine map isolate  and a human map isolate  persisted in relatively higher numbers when compared with a sheep map isolate  at 24-hr, 48-hr and 96-hr post infection . mdms stimulated with b <dig> up-regulated il- <dig> at the transcript level and down-regulated tnfα at the protein and transcript levels compared with stimulations by the s <dig> and hu <dig>  mdms infected with hu <dig> showed a down regulatory pattern of il- <dig> and tnfα compared to stimulations by s <dig>  cells stimulated with b <dig> and hu <dig> had low levels of matrix metalloprotease- <dig>  and high levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease- <dig>  at 96-hr pi relative to mdms stimulated by s <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, results suggest that the bovine  and the human  map isolates lead to anti-inflammatory and anti-invasive pathways in the macrophage environment whereas the sheep  map isolate induces a pro-inflammatory pathway. thus the infecting strain genotype may play a role in polarizing the host immune responses and dictate the clinicopathological outcomes in this economically important disease.
