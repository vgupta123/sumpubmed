BACKGROUND
dysregulation of imprinted genes, which are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, plays an important role in various human diseases, such as cancer and behavioral disorder. to date, however, fewer than  <dig> imprinted genes have been identified in the human genome. the recent availability of high-throughput technology makes it possible to have large-scale prediction of imprinted genes. here we propose a bayesian model  to predict imprinted genes on the basis of allelic expression observed in mrna-seq data of independent human tissues.


RESULTS
our model  was capable of identifying imprinted genes with high sensitivity and specificity and a low false discovery rate when the number of sequenced tissue samples was fairly large, according to simulations. by applying dspig to the mrna-seq data, we predicted  <dig> imprinted genes in  <dig> cerebellum samples and  <dig> imprinted genes in  <dig> diverse tissue samples with expected low false discovery rates. we also assessed dspig using previously validated imprinted and non-imprinted genes. with simulations, we further analyzed how imbalanced allelic expression of non-imprinted genes or different minor allele frequencies affected the predictions of dspig. interestingly, we found that, among biallelically expressed genes, at least  <dig> genes expressed significantly more transcripts from one allele than the other among different individuals and tissues.


CONCLUSIONS
with the prevalence of the mrna-seq technology, dspig has become a useful tool for analysis of allelic expression and large-scale prediction of imprinted genes. for ease of use, we have set up a web service and also provided an r package for dspig at http://www.shoudanliang.com/dspig/.
