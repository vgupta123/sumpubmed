BACKGROUND
time-lapse analysis of cellular images is an important and growing need in biology. algorithms for cell tracking are widely available; what researchers have been missing is a single open-source software package to visualize standard tracking output  in a way that allows convenient assessment of track quality, especially for researchers tuning tracking parameters for high-content time-lapse experiments. this makes quality assessment and algorithm adjustment a substantial challenge, particularly when dealing with hundreds of time-lapse movies collected in a high-throughput manner.


RESULTS
we present cellprofiler tracer, a free and open-source tool that complements the object tracking functionality of the cellprofiler biological image analysis package. tracer allows multi-parametric morphological data to be visualized on object tracks, providing visualizations that have already been validated within the scientific community for time-lapse experiments, and combining them with simple graph-based measures for highlighting possible tracking artifacts.


CONCLUSIONS
cellprofiler tracer is a useful, free tool for inspection and quality control of object tracking data, available from http://www.cellprofiler.org/tracer/.
