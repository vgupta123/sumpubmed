BACKGROUND
kiwi is a highly distinctive, flightless and endangered ratite bird endemic to new zealand. to understand the patterns of molecular evolution of the nuclear protein-coding genes in brown kiwi  and to determine the timescale of avian history we sequenced a transcriptome obtained from a kiwi embryo using next generation sequencing methods. we then assembled the conserved protein-coding regions using the chicken proteome as a scaffold.


RESULTS
using  <dig>  conserved protein coding genes we estimated the neutral evolutionary divergence between the kiwi and chicken to be ~45%, which is approximately equal to the divergence computed for the human-mouse pair using the same set of genes. a large fraction of genes was found to be under high selective constraint, as most of the expressed genes appeared to be involved in developmental gene regulation. our study suggests a significant relationship between gene expression levels and protein evolution. using sequences from over  <dig> nuclear genes we estimated the divergence between the two basal avian groups, palaeognathae and neognathae to be  <dig> million years, which is consistent with previous studies using mitochondrial genes.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this investigation revealed patterns of mutation and purifying selection in conserved protein coding regions in birds. furthermore this study suggests a relatively cost-effective way of obtaining a glimpse into the fundamental molecular evolutionary attributes of a genome, particularly when no closely related genomic sequence is available.
