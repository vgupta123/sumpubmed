BACKGROUND
mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides sc is the pathogenic agent of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia , the most important disease of cattle in africa causing significant economic losses. the re-emergence of cbpp in europe in the 1980s and 1990s illustrates that it is still a threat also to countries that have successfully eradicated the disease in the past. nowadays, probe-based real-time pcr techniques are among the most advanced tools for a reliable identification and a sensitive detection of many pathogens, but only few protocols have been published so far for cbpp diagnosis. therefore we developed a novel taqmanÂ®-based real-time pcr assay comprising the amplification of two independent targets  and an internal exogenous amplification control in a multiplex reaction and evaluated its diagnostic performance with clinical samples.


RESULTS
the assays detected  <dig> mmmsc strains from diverse temporal and geographical origin, but did not amplify dna from  <dig> isolates of  <dig> non-target species confirming a specificity of 100%. the detection limit was determined to be  <dig> fg dna per reaction for the msc_ <dig> assay and  <dig> fg per reaction for the msc_ <dig> assay corresponding to  <dig> and  <dig> genome equivalents, respectively. the diagnostic performance of the assay was evaluated with clinical samples from  <dig> experimentally infected cattle and from  <dig> cattle without cbpp and compared to those of cultivation and a conventional pcr protocol. the two rt-pcr tests proved to be the most sensitive methods and identified all  <dig> infected animals. the different sample types used were not equally suitable for mmmsc detection. while  <dig> % of lung samples from the infected cohort were positively tested in the msc_ <dig> assay, only 81% of pulmonal lymph nodes, 31% of mediastinal lymph nodes and 25% of pleural fluid samples gave a positive result.


CONCLUSIONS
the developed multiplex rt-pcr assay is recommended as an efficient tool for rapid confirmation of a presumptive cbpp diagnosis in a well-equipped laboratory environment.
