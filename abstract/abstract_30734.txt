BACKGROUND
caseous lymphadenitis  is a contagious infectious disease of small ruminants caused by corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. is characterized by the formation of abscesses in the lymph nodes and intestines of infected animals, induced by inflammatory cytokines. the production of cytokines, such as il- <dig>  tnf-α, il- <dig> and ifn-γ, is regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathway activation. the present study investigated the involvement of mapk pathways  with respect to the production of cytokines induced by antigens secreted by c. pseudotuberculosis over a 60-day course of infection. cba mice  were divided into three groups and infected with  <dig> colony forming units  of attenuated strain t <dig>  102 cfu of virulent strain vd <dig> or sterile saline solution and euthanized after  <dig> or 60 days. murine splenocytes were treated with specific inhibitors  and cultured with secreted antigens obtained from pathogenic bacteria .


RESULTS
the mapk pathways evaluated were observed to be involved in the production of il- <dig>  under stimulation by secreted antigens, while the mapk p <dig> and erk  <dig> pathways were shown to be primarily involved in tnf-α production. by contrast, no involvement of the mapk p <dig> and erk  <dig> and  <dig> pathways was observed in ifn-γ production, while the erk  <dig> pathway demonstrated involvement in il- <dig> production only in the mouse splenocytes infected with vd <dig> under stimulation by set <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the authors hypothesize that mapk p <dig> and erk  <dig> pathways with respect to tnf-α production, as well as the mapk p <dig> and erk  <dig> and  <dig> pathways in relation to il- <dig> production under infection by c. pseudotuberculosis are important regulators of cellular response. additionally, the lack of the mapk p <dig> and erk 1/ <dig> pathways in ifn-γ production in infected cba murine cells stimulated with the two secreted/excreted antigens, in il- <dig> production showing involvement only via the erk  <dig> pathway under stimulation by set <dig> antigen during 60-day infection period with the virulent strain, suggests that these pathways regulated the production of pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines in the splenic cells of cba mice.
