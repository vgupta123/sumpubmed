BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small  non-coding rnas that regulate cell movement, specification, and development. expression of mirnas is highly regulated, both spatially and temporally. based on direct cloning, sequence conservation, and predicted secondary structures, a large number of mirnas have been identified in higher eukaryotic genomes but whether these rnas are simply a subset of a much larger number of noncoding rna families is unknown. this is especially true in zebrafish where genome sequencing and annotation is not yet complete.


RESULTS
we analyzed the zebrafish genome to identify the number and location of proven and predicted mirnas resulting in the identification of  <dig> new mirnas. we then grouped all  <dig> zebrafish mirnas into families based on seed sequence identity as a means to identify possible functional redundancy. based on genomic location and expression analysis, we also identified those mirnas that are likely to be encoded as part of polycistronic transcripts. lastly, as a resource, we compiled existing zebrafish mirna expression data and, where possible, listed all experimentally proven mrna targets.


CONCLUSIONS
current analysis indicates the zebrafish genome encodes  <dig> mirnas which can be grouped into  <dig> families. the largest of these families  contains  <dig> members largely clustered in two main locations along chromosome  <dig>  thus far, most zebrafish mirnas exhibit tissue specific patterns of expression.
