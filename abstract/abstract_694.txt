BACKGROUND
angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from the pre-existing vasculature is associated with pathological processes, in particular tumour development, and is a target for the development of new therapies. we have investigated the anti-angiogenic potential of two naturally occurring stilbene glycosides  isolated from the medicinal plant boswellia papyriferai using large and smallvessel-derived endothelial cells. compound  <dig> -[α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-}-β-d-glucopyranoside was the more hydrophilic and inhibited fgf-2-induced proliferation, wound healing, invasion in matrigel, tube formation and angiogenesis in large and small vessel-derived endothelial cells and also in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. using a binding assay we were able to show compound  <dig> reduced binding of fgf- <dig> to fibroblast growth factor receptors- <dig> and - <dig>  in all cases the concentration of compound  <dig> which caused 50% inhibition  was determined. the effect of compound  <dig> on egf and vegf-induced proliferation was also investigated.


RESULTS
compound  <dig> inhibited all stages of fgf- <dig> induced angiogenesis with ic <dig> values in the range  <dig>  ±  <dig>  –  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm but did not inhibit egf or vegf-induced angiogenesis. it also inhibited fgf- <dig> binding to fgf receptor- <dig> and - <dig> with ic <dig> values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm respectively and with concommotant down-regulation of phosphorylated-erk-1/- <dig> expression. compound  <dig> was an ineffective inhibitor of angiogenesis despite its structural homology to compound  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
compound  <dig> inhibited fgf- <dig> induced angiogenesis by binding to its cognate receptors and is an addition to the small number of natural product inhibitors of angiogenesis
