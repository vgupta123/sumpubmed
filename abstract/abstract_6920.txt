BACKGROUND
v. cholerae is the etiological agent of cholera, a major public health concern in most developing countries. virulence of v. cholerae relies on the powerful cholera toxin, encoded by the ctx prophage. the emergence of new pathogenic variants in the recent years has been mostly associated with new ctx prophage rearrangements.


RESULTS
in this retrospective study, we show that the epidemic v. cholerae o <dig> el tor strain responsible for the  <dig> outbreak in angola is clonally and genetically different from el tor strains circulating in the 1990s in the same area. strains from  <dig> carry icevchang <dig> of the sxt/r <dig> family. this ice is associated with a narrower multidrug resistance profile compared to the one conferred by plasmid p3iang to strains of the 1990s. the ctx prophage carried by  <dig> el tor strains is characterized by rstret and ctxbcla alleles organized in a rs1-rs2-core array on chromosome i. interestingly, the newly emerging atypical strain belongs to a clade previously known to comprise only clinical isolates from the indian subcontinent that also contain the same ice of the sxt/r <dig> family.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings remark the appearance of a novel v. cholerae epidemic variant in africa with a new ctxÎ¦ arrangement previously described only in the indian subcontinent.
