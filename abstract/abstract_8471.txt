BACKGROUND
biodiesel or ethanol derived from lipids or starch produced by microalgae may overcome many of the sustainability challenges previously ascribed to petroleum-based fuels and first generation plant-based biofuels. the paucity of microalgae genome sequences, however, limits gene-based biofuel feedstock optimization studies. here we describe the sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly for the non-model microalgae species, dunaliella tertiolecta, and identify pathways and genes of importance related to biofuel production.


RESULTS
next generation dna pyrosequencing technology applied to d. tertiolecta transcripts produced  <dig> , <dig> high quality reads with an average length of  <dig> bases. following quality and size trimming, ~ 45% of the high quality reads were assembled into  <dig>  isotigs with a 31-fold coverage and  <dig>  singletons. assembled sequences and singletons were subjected to blast similarity searches and annotated with gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  orthology  identifiers. these analyses identified the majority of lipid and starch biosynthesis and catabolism pathways in d. tertiolecta.


CONCLUSIONS
the construction of metabolic pathways involved in the biosynthesis and catabolism of fatty acids, triacylglycrols, and starch in d. tertiolecta as well as the assembled transcriptome provide a foundation for the molecular genetics and functional genomics required to direct metabolic engineering efforts that seek to enhance the quantity and character of microalgae-based biofuel feedstock.
