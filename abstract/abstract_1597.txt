BACKGROUND
slc10a <dig> belongs to the solute carrier family slc <dig> whose founding members are the na+/taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide  and the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter . these carriers maintain the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids between the liver and the gut. slc10a <dig> was identified as a novel member of the slc <dig> carrier family with the highest phylogenetic relationship to ntcp. the slc10a <dig> protein was detected in synaptic vesicles of cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons of the peripheral and central nervous system, suggesting a transport function for any kind of neurotransmitter. therefore, in the present study, we performed systematic transport screenings for slc10a <dig> and also aimed to identify the vesicular sorting domain of the slc10a <dig> protein.


RESULTS
we detected a vesicle-like expression pattern of the slc10a <dig> protein in the neuronal cell lines sh-sy5y and cad. differentiation of these cells to the neuronal phenotype altered neither slc10a <dig> gene expression nor its vesicular expression pattern. functional transport studies with different neurotransmitters, bile acids and steroid sulfates were performed in slc10a4-transfected hek <dig> cells, slc10a4-transfected cad cells and in xenopus laevis oocytes. for these studies, transport by the dopamine transporter dat, the serotonin transporter sert, the choline transporter cht <dig>  the vesicular monoamine transporter vmat <dig>  the organic cation transporter oct <dig>  and ntcp were used as positive control. slc10a <dig> failed to show transport activity for dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, histamine, acetylcholine, choline, acetate, aspartate, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, pregnenolone sulfate, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, estrone-3-sulfate, and adenosine triphosphate, at least in the transport assays used. when the c-terminus of slc10a <dig> was replaced by the homologous sequence of ntcp, the slc10a4-ntcp chimeric protein revealed clear plasma membrane expression in cad and hek <dig> cells. but this chimera also did not show any transport activity, even when the n-terminal domain of slc10a <dig> was deleted by mutagenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
although different kinds of assays were used to screen for transport function, slc10a <dig> failed to show transport activity for a series of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, indicating that slc10a <dig> does not seem to represent a typical neurotransmitter transporter such as dat, sert, cht <dig> or vmat <dig>
