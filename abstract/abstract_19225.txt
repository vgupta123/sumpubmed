BACKGROUND
mechanisms that confer an ability to respond positively to environmental osmolarity are fundamental to ensuring embryo survival during the preimplantation period. activation of p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase  occurs following exposure to hyperosmotic treatment. recently, a novel scaffolding protein called osmosensing scaffold for mekk <dig>  was linked to p <dig> mapk activation in response to sorbitol-induced hypertonicity. the human ortholog of osm is cerebral cavernous malformation  <dig> . the present study was conducted to investigate whether ccm <dig> is expressed during mouse preimplantation development and to determine whether this scaffolding protein is associated with p <dig> mapk activation following exposure of preimplantation embryos to hyperosmotic environments.


RESULTS
our results indicate that ccm <dig> along with upstream p <dig> mapk pathway constituents  are expressed throughout mouse preimplantation development. ccm <dig>  map3k <dig> and the phosphorylated forms of map2k3/map2k <dig> and map2k <dig> were also detected throughout preimplantation development. embryo culture in hyperosmotic media increased p <dig> mapk activity in conjunction with elevated ccm <dig> levels.


CONCLUSIONS
these results define the expression of upstream activators of p <dig> mapk during preimplantation development and indicate that embryo responses to hyperosmotic environments include elevation of ccm <dig> and activation of p <dig> mapk.
