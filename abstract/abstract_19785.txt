BACKGROUND
phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase  catalyzes the synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate from pyruvate in escherichia coli when cells are grown on a three carbon source. it also catalyses the anabolic conversion of pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate in gluconeogenesis. a bioinformatics search conducted following the successful cloning and expression of maize leaf pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase regulatory protein  revealed the presence of pdrp homologs in more than  <dig> bacterial species; the pdrp homolog was identified as duf <dig> 


RESULTS
this paper describes the cloning and expression of both peps and duf <dig> from e. coli and establishes that e. coli duf <dig> catalyzes both the adp-dependent inactivation and the pi-dependent activation of peps.


CONCLUSIONS
this paper represents the first report of a bifunctional regulatory enzyme catalysing an adp-dependent phosphorylation and a pi-dependent pyrophosphorylation reaction in bacteria.
