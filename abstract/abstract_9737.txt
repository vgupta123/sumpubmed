BACKGROUND
obesity, the excessive accumulation of body fat, is a highly heritable and genetically heterogeneous disorder. the complex, polygenic basis for the disease consisting of a network of different gene variants is still not completely known.


RESULTS
in the current study we generated a bac library of the obese-prone nzo strain to clarify the genomic alteration within the gene cluster ifi <dig> on chr. <dig> including ifi202b, an obesity gene that is in contrast to nzo not expressed in the lean b <dig> mouse. with the pacbio sequencing data of nzo bac clones we identified a deletion spanning approximately  <dig>  kb in the b <dig> reference genome. the deletion affects different members of the ifi <dig> gene family which also includes the original first exon and 5′-regulatory parts of the ifi202b gene and suggests to be the relevant cause of its expression deficiency in b <dig>  in addition, the generation and characterization of congenic mice carrying the critical fragment on the b <dig> background demonstrate its crucial role for obesity and insulin resistance.


CONCLUSIONS
our data reveal the reconstruction of a complex genomic region on mouse chr. <dig> resulting from deletions and duplications of ifi <dig> genes and suggest to be relevant for the development of obesity. the results further demonstrate the complexity of the disease and highlight the importance for studying rare genetic variants as they can be causal for large effects.
