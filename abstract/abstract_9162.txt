BACKGROUND
cancer is a disease driven by the accumulation of genomic alterations, including the integration of exogenous dna into the human somatic genome. we previously identified in silico evidence of dna fragments from a pseudomonas-like bacteria integrating into the 5′-utr of four proto-oncogenes in stomach cancer sequencing data. the functional and biological consequences of these bacterial dna integrations remain unknown.


RESULTS
modeling of these integrations suggests that the previously identified sequences cover most of the sequence flanking the junction between the bacterial and human dna. further examination of these reads reveals that these integrations are rich in guanine nucleotides and the integrated bacterial dna may have complex transcript secondary structures.


CONCLUSIONS
the models presented here lay the foundation for future experiments to test if bacterial dna integrations alter the transcription of the human genes.
