BACKGROUND
rubber tree  is an important industrial crop cultivated in tropical areas for natural rubber production. treatment of the bark of rubber trees with ehephon  has been a routine measure to increase latex yield, but the molecular mechanism behind the stimulation of rubber production by ethylene still remains a puzzle. deciphering the enigma is of great importance for improvement of rubber tree for high yield.


RESULTS
de novo sequencing and assembly of the bark transciptomes of hevea brasiliensis induced with ethephon for 8 h  and 24 h  were performed.  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> high-quality clean reads from e <dig>  e <dig> and c  samples were assembled into  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes respectively, with a total of  <dig>  unigenes and an average length of  <dig>  bp generated.  <dig>  and  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  in e <dig> and e <dig> compared with c were respectively detected. the expression of several enzymes in crucial points of regulation in glycolysis were up-regulated and degs were not significantly enriched in isopentenyl diphosphate  biosynthesis pathway. in addition, up-regulated genes of great regulatory importance in carbon fixation  were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
the rapid acceleration of glycolytic pathway supplying precursors for the biosynthesis of ipp and natural rubber, instead of rubber biosynthesis per se, may be responsible for ethylene stimulation of latex yield in rubber tree. the elevated rate of flux throughout the calvin cycle may account for some durability of ethylene-induced stimulation. our finding lays the foundations for molecular diagnostic and genetic engineering for high-yielding improvement of rubber tree.
