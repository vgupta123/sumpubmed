BACKGROUND
sensory consequences of our own actions are perceived differently from the sensory stimuli that are generated externally. the present event-related potential  study examined the neural responses to self-triggered stimulation relative to externally-triggered stimulation as a function of delays between the motor act and the stimulus onset. while sustaining a vowel phonation, subjects clicked a mouse and heard pitch-shift stimuli  in voice auditory feedback at delays of either 0 ms  or 500–1000 ms . the motor effect resulting from the mouse click was corrected in the data analyses. for the externally-triggered condition, pss were delivered by a computer with a delay of 500–1000 ms after the vocal onset.


RESULTS
as compared to unpredictable externally-triggered pss, p <dig> responses to predictable self-triggered pss were significantly suppressed, whereas an enhancement effect for p <dig> responses was observed when the timing of self-triggered pss was unpredictable.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings demonstrate the effect of the temporal predictability of stimulus delivery with respect to the motor act on the neural responses to self-triggered stimulation. responses to self-triggered stimulation were suppressed or enhanced compared with the externally-triggered stimulation when the timing of stimulus delivery was predictable or unpredictable. enhancement effect of unpredictable self-triggered stimulation in the present study supports the idea that sensory suppression of self-produced action may be primarily caused by an accurate prediction of stimulus timing, rather than a movement-related non-specific suppression.
