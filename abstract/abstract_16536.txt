BACKGROUND
the incidence of gastric cancer differs among countries in asia, and it has been suggested that virulence factors associated with helicobacter pylori are partly responsible. the aim of this study was to investigate several genetic factors regarded as virulence or molecular epidemiologic markers in h. pylori isolates from vietnamese subjects.


RESULTS
the caga, vaca and cag right-end junction genotypes of  <dig> h. pylori strains from vietnam  were determined by pcr and sequencing. three types of deletion in the region located upstream of the caga glu-pro-ile-tyr-ala  repeat region were identified: the 39-bp deletion type, the 18-bp deletion type, and the no-deletion type. the majority of strains studied  had the 18-bp deletion irrespective of geographical location in the country or clinical outcome. all of the 39-bp and 18-bp deletion-type strains possessed the east asian type caga repeat region. the type ii cag right-end junction genotype was predominant . the vaca m <dig> genotype was significantly more common in strains isolated in hanoi, where the incidence of gastric cancer is higher, than in strains from ho chi minh.


CONCLUSIONS
pre-epiya-region typing of the caga gene could provide a new genetic marker of h. pylori genomic diversity. our data support the hypothesis that vaca m <dig> is closely associated with gastric carcinogenesis.
