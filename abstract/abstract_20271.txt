BACKGROUND
pparγ agonists ameliorate insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in type  <dig> diabetic patients. adiponectin possesses insulin sensitizing properties, and predicts insulin sensitivity of both glucose and lipid metabolism. in diet-induced insulin resistant rats and zdf rats, the current studies determined the correlation between pparγ agonist-upregulated fatty acid binding protein mrna in adipose tissue and pparγ agonist-elevated serum adiponectin, and the correlation between pparγ agonist-elevated serum adiponectin and pparγ agonist-mediated efficacy in insulin sensitization and lipid lowering.


RESULTS
parallel groups of sd rats were fed a high fat/sucrose  diet for  <dig> weeks. these rats were orally treated for the later  <dig> weeks with vehicle, either pparγ agonist gi <dig> , or gw <dig> . rats on hf diet showed significant increases in postprandial serum triglycerides, free fatty acids , insulin, and area under curve  of serum insulin during an oral glucose tolerance test, but showed no change in serum glucose, adiponectin, and glucose auc. treatment with gi <dig> dose-dependently upregulated adipose fabp <dig> mrna, and increased serum adiponectin. there was a positive correlation between adipose fabp <dig> mrna and serum adiponectin . gi <dig> dose-dependently decreased the diet-induced elevations in triglycerides, ffa, insulin, and insulin auc. treatment with gw <dig> had similar effects on serum adiponectin and the diet-induced elevations. there were negative correlations for adiponectin versus triglycerides, ffa, insulin, and insulin auc . in zdf rats treated with pparγ agonists pioglitazone  or gw <dig> , there were also negative correlations for serum adiponectin versus glucose, triglycerides, ffa .


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that  pparγ agonists improved insulin sensitivity and ameliorated dyslipidemia in hf fed rats and zdf rats, which were correlated with serum adiponectin;  serum adiponectin was positively correlated with adipose fabp <dig> mrna in gi262570-treated rats. these data suggest that serum adiponectin can serve as a biomarker for both in vivo pparγ activation and pparγ agonist-induced efficacy on insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in rats.
