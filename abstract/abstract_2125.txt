BACKGROUND
understanding the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms of speciation genes in sexually reproducing organisms would provide important insights into mammalian reproduction and fitness. prdm <dig>  a widely known speciation gene, has recently gained attention for its important role in meiotic recombination and hybrid incompatibility. despite the fact that prdm <dig> is a key regulator of recombination and plays a dominant role in hybrid incompatibility, little is known about the underlying genetic and evolutionary mechanisms that generated multiple copies of prdm <dig> in many metazoan lineages.


RESULTS
the present study reports  evidence of ruminant-specific multiple gene duplication events, which likely have had occurred after the ancestral ruminant population diverged from its most recent common ancestor and before the ruminant speciation events,  presence of three copies of prdm <dig>  one copy  in chromosome  <dig>  and two copies  in chromosome x , thus indicating the possibility of ancient inter- and intra-chromosomal unequal crossing over and gene conversion events,  while lineages i and ii are characterized by the presence of variable tandemly repeated c2h <dig> zinc finger  arrays, lineage iii lost these arrays, and  c2h <dig> zfs of lineages i and ii, particularly the amino acid residues located at positions − <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> have evolved under strong positive selection.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrated two gene duplication events of prdm <dig> in ruminants: an inter-chromosomal duplication that occurred between chr <dig> and chrx, and an intra-chromosomal x-linked duplication, which resulted in two additional copies of prdm <dig> in ruminants. the observation of such duplication between chrx and chr <dig> is rare and may possibly have happened due to unequal crossing-over millions of years ago when sex chromosomes were independently derived from a pair of ancestral autosomes. two copies  are characterized by the presence of variable sized tandem-repeated c2h <dig> zfs and evolved under strong positive selection and concerted evolution, supporting the notion of well-established red queen hypothesis. collectively, gene duplication, concerted evolution, and positive selection are the likely driving forces for the expansion of ruminant prdm <dig> sub-family.
