BACKGROUND
increasingly biological text mining research is focusing on the extraction of complex relationships relevant to the construction and curation of biological networks and pathways. however, one important category of pathway — metabolic pathways — has been largely neglected.

here we present a relatively simple method for extracting metabolic reaction information from free text that scores different permutations of assigned entities  within a given sentence based on the presence and location of stemmed keywords. this method extends an approach that has proved effective in the context of the extraction of protein–protein interactions.


RESULTS
when evaluated on a set of manually-curated metabolic pathways using standard performance criteria, our method performs surprisingly well. precision and recall rates are comparable to those previously achieved for the well-known protein-protein interaction extraction task.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that automated metabolic pathway construction is more tractable than has often been assumed, and that  relatively simple text-mining approaches can prove surprisingly effective. it is hoped that these results will provide an impetus to further research and act as a useful benchmark for judging the performance of more sophisticated methods that are yet to be developed.
