BACKGROUND
the mir- <dig> subfamily belongs to an x-linked primate-specific mir506- <dig> cluster. across primate species, there have been several duplication events and different species each possess a variety of mir- <dig> copies, indicating it underwent rapid evolution. evidence suggests that this subfamily is preferentially expressed in the testis, but otherwise, to date, the evolutionary history and functional significance of this mirna subfamily has remained largely unexplored.


RESULTS
we analyzed the evolutionary pattern of gene duplications and their functional consequence for the mir- <dig> subfamily in primates. sequence comparisons showed that the duplicated copies of mir- <dig> were derived from transposable element . moreover, duplication events of the mir- <dig> subfamily seem to have occurred independently in platyrrhini  and catarrhini  after they diverged. different copies of the mir- <dig> subfamily  have different seed sequences, due to after-duplication sequence divergences, which eventually led to functional divergences. the results of functional assays indicated that mir-513b could inhibit the expression of its target gene, the down-regulator of transcription  <dig>  at both the mrna and protein levels. in the developing testis of rhesus macaques, we observed a temporal coupling of expression levels between mir-513b and dr <dig>  suggesting that mir-513b could affect male sexual maturation by negatively regulating the development-stage related functioning of dr <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the mir- <dig> subfamily underwent multiple independent gene duplications among five different lineages of primates. the after-duplication sequence divergences among the different copies of mir- <dig> led to functional divergence of these copies in primates.
