BACKGROUND
schmallenberg virus  has spread across europe since mid- <dig>  causing unspecific and transitory symptoms in ruminants and congenital malformations in their offspring. evidence for the impact of sbv on cattle productive performance is limited. using a comprehensive data set from a sbv-affected province in north-east italy, this study aimed at assessing the potential impact of sbv emergence on  <dig> productive and reproductive performance indicators of dairy cattle herds, accounting for weather conditions and other herd-level factors that could also influence these indicators.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> farms with an average of  <dig> cows per farm  were monitored monthly from january  <dig> to june  <dig>  mixed-effects linear models for longitudinal data were used to assess the average variation in herds’ performance indicators over semesters  and trimesters therein. taking the second semester of  <dig> as reference, significant decreases in the average lactation length  and calving-to-conception interval  were observed relative to the same semesters of the years  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. similarly, during the last trimester of  <dig>  which is most likely to cover the sbv infection period in the study area, there was an average decrease of −4 days  and −7 days  compared to the same trimesters of the years  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. however, the observed decreases actually represent a positive outcome that is not as such imputable to sbv emergence, but rather reflects other beneficial changes in farm management. none of the other indicators showed significant variations, confirming the relatively mild expression of sbv infection in cattle.


CONCLUSIONS
although the emergence of sbv might have significantly affected the productive performance of some individual farms, we concluded that overall at the province level there were no significant variations attributable to sbv, at least not in a way that would lead to negative effects on farm profitability.
