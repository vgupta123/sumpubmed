BACKGROUND
the application of microarray technology to functional genomic analysis in the chicken has been limited by the lack of arrays containing large numbers of genes.


RESULTS
we have produced cdna arrays using chicken est collections generated by bbsrc, university of delaware and the fred hutchinson cancer research center. from a total of  <dig>  chicken ests representing  <dig> different adult or embryonic tissues, a set of  <dig>  non-redundant ests were selected and added to an existing collection of clones  from immune tissues and a chicken bursal cell line . quality control analysis indicates there are  <dig>  useable features on the array, including  <dig> control spots. the array provides broad coverage of mrnas expressed in many tissues; in addition, clones with expression unique to various tissues can be detected.


CONCLUSIONS
a chicken multi-tissue cdna microarray with  <dig>  features is now available to academic researchers from genomics@fhcrc.org. sequence information for all features on the array is in genbank, and clones can be readily obtained. targeted users include researchers in comparative and developmental biology, immunology, vaccine and agricultural technology. these arrays will be an important resource for the entire research community using the chicken as a model.
