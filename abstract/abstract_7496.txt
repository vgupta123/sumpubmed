BACKGROUND
ketogenesis is a secondary metabolic pathway to provide energy to dairy cows during early lactation; however when the production of ketone bodies  is above certain levels a subclinical disorder may appear. the aim of the present study was to investigate the association between serum concentrations of ß- hydroxybutyrate  and fatty acid  profile of milk with emphasis in conjugated linoleic acid  in a population of early lactation holstein cows. fifty cows between parity  <dig> and  <dig>  ranging from  <dig> to 21 days in milk, were randomly selected from  <dig> farms of the central area of chile for determination of serum bhba concentrations, milk fat content, and milk fa profiles.


RESULTS
cows were divided in low  and high  bhba groups considering the median value of the serum concentration of bhba  . mean milk fat % was  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % for cows in the low and high bhba groups, respectively . concentrations of several fa were significantly different between both groups. specifically, mean cla concentrations were  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  for the low and high bhba groups, respectively .


CONCLUSIONS
it is concluded that early postpartum cows with serum bhba >  <dig>  mmol/l tended to have higher milk fat % and had significantly lower concentrations of cla than early postpartum cows with bhba ≤  <dig>  mmol/l.
