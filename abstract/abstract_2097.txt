BACKGROUND
massive parallel sequencing is a powerful tool for variant discovery and genotyping. to reduce costs, sequencing of restriction enzyme based reduced representation libraries can be utilized. this technology is generally referred to as genotyping by sequencing . to deal with gbs experimental design and initial processing specific bioinformatic tools are needed.


RESULTS
gbsx is a package that assists in selecting the appropriate enzyme and the design of compatible in-line barcodes. post sequencing, it performs optimized demultiplexing using these barcodes to create fastq files per barcode which can easily be plugged into existing variant analysis pipelines. here we demonstrate the usability of the gbsx toolkit and demonstrate improved in-line barcode demultiplexing and trimming performance compared to existing tools.


CONCLUSIONS
gbsx provides an easy to use suite of tools for designing and demultiplexing of gbs experiments.
