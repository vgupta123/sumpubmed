BACKGROUND
spot  <dig> was discovered in escherichia coli nearly  <dig> years ago as an abundant, small and unstable rna. its biological role has remained obscure until recently, and is today implicated in having broader roles in the central and secondary metabolism. spot  <dig> is encoded by the spf gene. the gene is ubiquitous in the vibrionaceae family of gamma-proteobacteria. one member of this family, aliivibrio salmonicida, causes cold-water vibriosis in farmed atlantic salmon. its genome encodes spot  <dig> with 84% identity to e. coli spot  <dig> 


RESULTS
we generated a a. salmonicida spf deletion mutant. we then used microarray and northern blot analyses to monitor global effects on the transcriptome in order to provide insights into the biological roles of spot  <dig> in this bacterium. in the presence of glucose, we found a surprisingly large number of â‰¥ 2x differentially expressed genes, and several major cellular processes were affected. a gene encoding a pirin-like protein showed an on/off expression pattern in the presence/absence of spot  <dig>  which suggests that spot  <dig> plays a key regulatory role in the central metabolism by regulating the switch between fermentation and respiration. interestingly, we discovered an srna named vssrna <dig>  which is encoded immediately downstream of spf. this new srna has an expression pattern opposite to that of spot  <dig>  and its expression is repressed by glucose.


CONCLUSIONS
we hypothesize that spot  <dig> plays a key role in the central metabolism, in part by regulating the pyruvat dehydrogenase enzyme complex via pirin.
