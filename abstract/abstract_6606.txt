BACKGROUND
the znf <dig> gene, encoding a c2h <dig> zinc finger protein, is located at 20q <dig> and found amplified and overexpressed in greater than 20% of breast tumors. current studies indicate znf <dig> drives tumorigenesis, yet the regulatory mechanisms of znf <dig> are largely unknown. because znf <dig> associates with chromatin modifying enzymes, we postulate that znf <dig> functions to regulate specific gene signaling networks. here, we present a large-scale functional genomic analysis of znf <dig>  which provides insights into the regulatory role of znf <dig> in mcf <dig> breast cancer cells.


RESULTS
chip-seq analysis reveals that the majority of znf <dig> binding sites are located at distal regulatory regions associated with the chromatin marks h3k27ac and h3k4me <dig>  analysis of chip-seq transcription factor binding sites shows clustering of znf <dig> with foxa <dig>  gata <dig> and eralpha binding sites, supported by the enrichment of corresponding motifs for the eralpha-associated cis-regulatory sequences. eralpha expression highly correlates with znf <dig> in lysates from breast tumors , and eralpha co-precipitates znf <dig> and its binding partner ctbp <dig> from nuclear extracts. transcriptome profiling following znf <dig> depletion identifies differentially expressed genes co-bound by znf <dig> and eralpha; gene ontology suggests a role for znf217-eralpha in expression programs associated with er+ breast cancer studies found in the molecular signature database. data-mining of expression data from breast cancer patients correlates znf <dig> with reduced overall survival.


CONCLUSIONS
our genome-wide znf <dig> data suggests a functional role for znf <dig> at eralpha target genes. future studies will investigate whether znf <dig> expression contributes to aberrant eralpha regulatory events in er+ breast cancer and hormone resistance.
