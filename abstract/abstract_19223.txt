BACKGROUND
with the continued proliferation of high-throughput biological experiments, there is a pressing need for tools to integrate the data produced in ways that produce biologically meaningful conclusions. many microarray studies have analysed transcriptomic data from a pathway perspective, for instance by testing for kegg pathway enrichment in sets of upregulated genes. however, the increasing availability of species-specific metabolic models provides the opportunity to analyse these data in a more objective, system-wide manner.


RESULTS
here we introduce ambient , a simulated annealing approach to the discovery of metabolic subnetworks  that are significantly affected by a given genetic or environmental change. the metabolic modules returned by ambient are connected parts of the bipartite network that change coherently between conditions, providing a more detailed view of metabolic changes than standard approaches based on pathway enrichment.


CONCLUSIONS
ambient is an effective and flexible tool for the analysis of high-throughput data in a metabolic context. the same approach can be applied to any system in which reactions  can be assigned a score based on some biological observation, without the limitation of predefined pathways. a python implementation of ambient is available at http://www.theosysbio.bio.ic.ac.uk/ambient.
