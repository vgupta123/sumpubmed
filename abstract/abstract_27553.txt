BACKGROUND
the volume of data available on genetic variations has increased considerably with the recent development of high-density, single-nucleotide polymorphism  arrays. several software programs have been developed to assist researchers in the analysis of this huge amount of data, but few can rely upon a whole genome variability visualisation system that could help data interpretation.


RESULTS
we have developed genotypecolour™ as a rapid user-friendly tool able to upload, visualise and compare the huge amounts of data produced by affymetrix human mapping genechips without losing the overall view of the data.

some features of genotypecolour™ include visualising the entire genome variability in a single screenshot for one or more samples, the simultaneous display of the genotype and copy number state for thousands of snps, and the comparison of large amounts of samples by producing "consensus" images displaying regions of complete or partial identity. the software is also useful for genotype analysis of trios and to show regions of potential uniparental disomy . all information can then be exported in a tabular format for analysis with dedicated software. at present, the software can handle data from  <dig> k,  <dig> k,  <dig> k,  <dig>  and  <dig>  affymetrix chips.


CONCLUSIONS
we have created a software that offers a new way of displaying and comparing snp and cnv genomic data. the software is available free at  and is especially useful for the analysis of multiple samples.
