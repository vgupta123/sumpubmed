BACKGROUND
several recently completed large-scale enviromental sequencing projects produced a large amount of genetic information about microbial communities  which is not biased towards cultured organisms. it is a good source for estimation of the abundance of genes and regulatory structures in both known and unknown members of microbial communities. in this study we consider the distribution of rna regulatory structures, riboswitches, in the sargasso sea, minnesota soil and whale falls metagenomes.


RESULTS
over three hundred riboswitches were found in about  <dig> gbp metagenome dna sequences. the abundabce of riboswitches in metagenomes was highest for the tpp, b <dig> and gcvt riboswitches; the s-box, rfn, ykkc/yxkd, yybp/ykoy regulatory elements showed lower but significant abundance, while the lys, g-box, glms and ykok riboswitches were rare. regions downstream of identified riboswitches were scanned for open reading frames. comparative analysis of identified orfs revealed new riboswitch-regulated functions for several classes of riboswitches. in particular, we have observed phosphoserine aminotransferase serc  and malate synthase glcb  to be regulated by the glycine  riboswitch; fatty acid desaturase ole <dig> , by the cobalamin  riboswitch; 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase ykrs , by the sam-riboswitch. we also identified conserved riboswitches upstream of genes of unknown function: thiamine , cobalamine , and glycine .


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates applicability of bioinformatics to the analysis of rna regulatory structures in metagenomes.
