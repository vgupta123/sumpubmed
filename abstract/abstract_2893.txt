BACKGROUND
there exist many methods for describing the complex relation between changes of gene expression in molecular pathways or gene ontologies under different experimental conditions. among them, gene set enrichment analysis seems to be one of the most commonly used . an important parameter, which could affect the final result, is the choice of a metric for the ranking of genes. applying a default ranking metric may lead to poor results.

methods and 
RESULTS
in this work  <dig> benchmark data sets were used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positive rate of gene set analysis for  <dig> different ranking metrics including new proposals. furthermore, the robustness of the chosen methods to sample size was tested. using k-means clustering algorithm a group of four metrics with the highest performance in terms of overall sensitivity, overall false positive rate and computational load was established i.e. absolute value of moderated welch test statistic, minimum significant difference, absolute value of signal-to-noise ratio and baumgartner-weiss-schindler test statistic. in case of false positive rate estimation, all selected ranking metrics were robust with respect to sample size. in case of sensitivity, the absolute value of moderated welch test statistic and absolute value of signal-to-noise ratio gave stable results, while baumgartner-weiss-schindler and minimum significant difference showed better results for larger sample size. finally, the gene set enrichment analysis method with all tested ranking metrics was parallelised and implemented in matlab, and is available at https://github.com/zaedpolsl/mrgsea.


CONCLUSIONS
choosing a ranking metric in gene set enrichment analysis has critical impact on results of pathway enrichment analysis. the absolute value of moderated welch test has the best overall sensitivity and minimum significant difference has the best overall specificity of gene set analysis. when the number of non-normally distributed genes is high, using baumgartner-weiss-schindler test statistic gives better outcomes. also, it finds more enriched pathways than other tested metrics, which may induce new biological discoveries.
