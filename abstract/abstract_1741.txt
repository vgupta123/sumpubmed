BACKGROUND
biologists are puzzled by the extremely low percentage  of the binding targets of a yeast transcription factor  affected when the tf is knocked out, a phenomenon observed by comparing the tf binding dataset and tf knockout effect dataset.


RESULTS
this study gives a plausible biological explanation of this counterintuitive phenomenon. our analyses find that tfs with high functional redundancy show significantly lower percentage than do tfs with low functional redundancy. this suggests that functional redundancy may lead to one tf compensating for another, thus masking the tf knockout effect on the binding targets of the knocked-out tf. in addition, we show that seven classes of genes , genes with low transcriptional plasticity, genes with a low number of bound tfs, genes with a low number of tfbss, and genes with a short average distance of tfbss to the tss) are insensitive to the knockout of their promoter-binding tfs, providing clues for finding other biological explanations of the surprisingly low percentage of the binding targets of a tf affected when the tf is knocked out.


CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that one property of tfs  and seven properties of genes  may be useful for explaining a counterintuitive phenomenon: most binding targets of a yeast transcription factor are not affected when the transcription factor is knocked out.
