BACKGROUND
epilepsy in the cat is a serious medical condition. to date there are no licensed treatments for feline epilepsy and no well-controlled clinical studies on the efficacy or safety of antiepileptic drugs in cats. the aim of this study was to collect tolerability ﻿data﻿ and first exploratory efficacy data of imepitoin in both healthy and epileptic cats.


RESULTS
in two tolerability studies,  <dig> healthy cats received imepition twice daily in doses of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 80 mg/kg bodyweight for 30 days. no serious adverse events were observed in any of the dose groups. in the imepitoin treated groups, emesis was observed in some animals temporarily and intermittently mainly in the second and third weeks of treatment.

in a small, single-arm, open label, uncontrolled clinical trial eight cats suffering from idiopathic epilepsy were treated with imepitoin twice daily at doses of 30 mg/kg bodyweight for 30 days. four of these cats  achieved seizure freedom for at least 8 weeks under treatment. adverse events, mostly lethargy, decreased appetite and emesis, were often mild and transient.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, imepitoin was well tolerated in healthy and epileptic cats and showed in a pilot trial indication for efficacy in treating feline epilepsy.
