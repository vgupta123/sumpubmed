BACKGROUND
manual annotation of enzymatic functions cannot keep up with automatic genome sequencing. in this work we explore the capacity of interpro sequence signatures to automatically predict enzymatic function.


RESULTS
we present enzml, a multi-label classification method that can efficiently account also for proteins with multiple enzymatic functions:  <dig>  in uniprot. enzml was evaluated using a standard set of  <dig>  proteins for which the manually curated swiss-prot and kegg databases have agreeing enzyme commission  annotations. enzml achieved more than 98% subset accuracy  for the entire dataset and between  <dig> and 97% subset accuracy in reannotating eight entire proteomes: human, mouse, rat, mouse-ear cress, fruit fly, the s. pombe yeast, the e. coli bacterium and the m. jannaschii archaebacterium. to understand the role played by the dataset size, we compared the cross-evaluation results of smaller datasets, either constructed at random or from specific taxonomic domains such as archaea, bacteria, fungi, invertebrates, plants and vertebrates. the results were confirmed even when the redundancy in the dataset was reduced using uniref <dig>  uniref <dig> or uniref <dig> clusters.


CONCLUSIONS
interpro signatures are a compact and powerful attribute space for the prediction of enzymatic function. this representation makes multi-label machine learning feasible in reasonable time  using the mulan binary relevance nearest neighbours algorithm implementation .
