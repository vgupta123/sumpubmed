BACKGROUND
dysregulation of microrna- <dig>  is commonly observed in solid tumor and has been reported to be involved in multiple important biological processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis. elevated mir- <dig> level was also detected in cervical carcinoma, whereas its function in cancer progression has not been studied yet.

methods
the expression of mirna- <dig> in cervical carcinoma was compared with normal cervical tissue and using qrt-pcr. the effects of mir- <dig> on cell cycle and apoptosis, as well as the expression of cycle- and apoptosis-related genes, were determined using flow cytometry, tunel assay, qrt-pcr, and western blot, respectively. the direct target of mir- <dig> was confirmed using 3′ untranslated region  luciferase reporter assay.


RESULTS
mir- <dig> promotes cervical cancer cell survival and growth, while the inhibition of mir- <dig> suppresses these actions. mir- <dig> also induced the cell cycle progression from g1/g <dig> to s phase, resulting in an enhancement of growth. several cell cycle- and apoptosis-related genes, cyclind <dig>  p <dig>  bim, and fasl were modulated by mir- <dig>  moreover, mir- <dig> directly reduced the expression of foxo <dig>  which regulates the expression of cyclind <dig>  p <dig>  bim, and fasl, by targeting its 3′ utr.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data demonstrated that elevated mir- <dig> targets foxo <dig> expression and therefore regulates multiple genes expression, resulting in cervical cancer cell growth and survival.
