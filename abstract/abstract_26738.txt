BACKGROUND
yield of rapeseed is determined by three components: silique number, seed number per silique and thousand seed weight. seed number per silique and thousand seed weight are influenced by silique length, seed density, silique breadth, silique thickness and silique volume. some qtls for silique traits have been reported in b. napus, however, no studies have focused on the six agronomic traits  simultaneously, and the genetic determinism of such complex traits have not been fully elucidated.


RESULTS
in this study, the six silique traits were evaluated using  <dig> lines of a doubled haploid population, the kn population. the results showed that  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> qtls explaining > 10 % of phenotypic variation were obtained for silique length, silique breadth, silique thickness, seed number per silique and silique volume, respectively. notably, three major effect qtls  were identified in at least three environments, and  <dig> unique qtls controlling at least two traits were obtained. a high-density consensus map containing  <dig> markers was constructed for qtl comparison by combining the kn map with other five published maps. the comparative results revealed that  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> qtls for silique breadth, silique thickness and silique volume might be the potential new qtls because few qtls for these traits were reported in b. napus. in addition, potential new qtls for silique length , seed number per silique  and seed density  were also identified. twenty-five candidate genes underlying  <dig> qtls for silique related traits were obtained.


CONCLUSIONS
this study constructed qtl analysis in b. napus, and obtained  <dig> consensus qtls for six silique related traits. the potential new qtls will enhance our understanding of the genetic control of silique traits, and the stable qtls provided the targets for improving seed yield in future. these findings provided comprehensive insights into the genetic network affecting silique traits at qtl level in b. napus.
