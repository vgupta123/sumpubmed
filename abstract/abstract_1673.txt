BACKGROUND
the dinoflagellate alexandrium minutum typically produces paralytic shellfish poisoning  toxins, which are known only from cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates. while a psp toxin gene cluster has recently been characterized in cyanobacteria, the genetic background of psp toxin production in dinoflagellates remains elusive.


RESULTS
we constructed and analysed an expressed sequence tag  library of a. minutum, which contained  <dig>  read sequences yielding a total of  <dig>  unique expressed clusters. of these clusters, 72% combined the forward-and reverse reads of at least one bacterial clone. this sequence resource was then used to construct an oligonucleotide microarray. we analysed the expression of all clusters in three different strains. while the cyanobacterial psp toxin genes were not found among the a. minutum sequences,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed between toxic and non-toxic strains.


CONCLUSIONS
based on this study and on the lack of identified psp synthesis genes in the two existent alexandrium tamarense est libraries, we propose that the psp toxin genes in dinoflagellates might be more different from their cyanobacterial counterparts than would be expected in the case of a recent gene transfer. as a starting point to identify possible psp toxin-associated genes in dinoflagellates without relying on a priori sequence information, the sequences only present in mrna pools of the toxic strain can be seen as putative candidates involved in toxin synthesis and regulation, or acclimation to intracellular psp toxins.
