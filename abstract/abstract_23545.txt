BACKGROUND
development and function of tissue resident mast cells  is tightly controlled by various cytokines, most of which belong to the typical t helper  2-type cytokines such as il- <dig> and il- <dig>  the effects of the th1-type cytokine ifn-γ on human mcs is less clear.


RESULTS
here, we analyzed the effects of ifn-γ on tissue-derived, mature human mcs. we found that inf-γ decreases proliferation, without affecting apoptosis in human intestinal mcs cultured in the presence of optimal concentrations of stem cell factor  or scf and il- <dig>  however, in the absence of growth factors or at suboptimal concentrations of scf, inf-γ promotes survival through inhibition of mc apoptosis. interestingly, we found that inf-γ has no effect on fcϵri expression and fcϵri-mediated release of histamine and leukotriene c <dig>  while it has profound effects on fcγr expression and activation. we show that intestinal mcs express fcγri, fcγriia, and fcγriic, whereas fcγriib expression was found in only 40% of the isolates and fcγriii was never detectable. inf-γ strongly increases fcγri and decreases fcγriia expression. inf-γ-naïve mcs produce ltc <dig> but fail to degranulate upon crosslinking of surface-bound monomeric igg. in contrast, inf-γ-treated mcs rapidly release granule-stored histamine in addition to de novo-synthesized ltc <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we identify inf-γ as an important regulator of tissue-resident human mcs. ifn-γ displays a dual function by blocking extensive mc proliferation, while decreasing apoptosis in starving mcs and enhancing fcγri expression and activation. these results emphasize the involvement of mucosal mcs in th1-mediated disorders.
