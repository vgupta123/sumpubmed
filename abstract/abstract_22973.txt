BACKGROUND
the general population is constantly exposed to low levels of radiation through natural, occupational or medical irradiation. even if the biological effects of low-level radiation have been intensely debated and investigated, the molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular response to low doses remain largely unknown.


RESULTS
the present study investigated the role of gata <dig> protein in the control of the cellular and molecular response of human keratinocytes exposed to a  <dig> cgy dose of x-rays. chromatin immunoprecipitation showed gata <dig> to be able to bind the promoter of  <dig> genes responding to a  <dig> cgy exposure. to go further into the role of gata <dig> after ionizing radiation exposure, we studied the cellular and molecular consequences of radiation in gata <dig> knock-down cells. knock-down was obtained by lentiviral-mediated expression of an shrna targeting the gata <dig> transcript in differentiated keratinocytes. first, radiosensitivity was assessed: the toxicity, in terms of immediate survival , associated with  <dig> cgy radiation was found to be increased in gata <dig> knock-down cells. the impact of gata <dig> knock-down on the transcriptome of x-ray irradiated cells was also investigated, using oligonucleotide microarrays to assess changes between  <dig> h and  <dig> h post-irradiation in normal vs gata <dig> knock-down backgrounds; transcriptome response was found to be completely altered in gata <dig> knock-down cells, with a strong induction/repression peak  <dig> h after irradiation. functional annotation revealed enrichment in genes known to be involved in chaperone activity, tgfÎ² signalling and stress response.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these data indicate that gata <dig> is an important regulator of the cellular and molecular response of epidermal cells to very low doses of radiation.
