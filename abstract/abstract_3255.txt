BACKGROUND
α-synuclein  plays a central role in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, a group of neurodegenerative disorders that includes parkinson disease, dementia with lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. several findings from cell culture and mouse experiments suggest intercellular α-syn transfer.


RESULTS
through a methodology used to obtain synthetic mammalian prions, we tested whether recombinant human α-syn amyloids can promote prion-like accumulation in neuronal cell lines in vitro. a single exposure to amyloid fibrils of human α-syn was sufficient to induce aggregation of endogenous α-syn in human neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cells. remarkably, endogenous wild-type α-syn was sufficient for the formation of these aggregates, and overexpression of the protein was not required.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide compelling evidence that endogenous α-syn can accumulate in cell culture after a single exposure to exogenous α-syn short amyloid fibrils. importantly, using α-syn short amyloid fibrils as seed, endogenous α-syn aggregates and accumulates over several passages in cell culture, providing an excellent tool for potential therapeutic screening of pathogenic α-syn aggregates.
