BACKGROUND
lepidosauria  is a globally distributed and ecologically important group of over  <dig>  reptile species. the earliest fossil records are currently restricted to the late triassic and often dated to  <dig> million years ago . as these early records include taxa that are relatively derived in their morphology , an earlier unknown history of lepidosauria is implied. however, molecular age estimates for lepidosauria have been problematic; dates for the most recent common ancestor of all lepidosaurs range between approximately  <dig> and  <dig> mya whereas estimates for crown-group squamata  vary more dramatically:  <dig> to  <dig> mya. this uncertainty restricts inferences regarding the patterns of diversification and evolution of lepidosauria as a whole.


RESULTS
here we report on a rhynchocephalian fossil from the middle triassic of germany  that represents the oldest known record of a lepidosaur from anywhere in the world. reliably dated to 238â€“ <dig> mya, this material is about  <dig> million years older than previously known lepidosaur records and is older than some but not all molecular clock estimates for the origin of lepidosaurs. using rag <dig> sequence data from  <dig> extant taxa and the new fossil specimens two of several calibrations, we estimate that the most recent common ancestor of lepidosauria lived at least  <dig> mya , and crown-group squamata originated around  <dig> mya .


CONCLUSIONS
a early/middle triassic date for the origin of lepidosauria disagrees with previous estimates deep within the permian and suggests the group evolved as part of the faunal recovery after the end-permain mass extinction as the climate became more humid. our origin time for crown-group squamata coincides with shifts towards warmer climates and dramatic changes in fauna and flora. most major subclades within squamata originated in the cretaceous postdating major continental fragmentation. the vellberg fossil locality is expected to become an important resource for providing a more balanced picture of the triassic and for bridging gaps in the fossil record of several other major vertebrate groups.
