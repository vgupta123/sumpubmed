BACKGROUND
recently, equine multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells  have received significant attention as therapy for various conditions due to their proposed regenerative and immune-modulating capacity. msc are commonly administered to the patient through a hypodermic needle. currently, little information is available on the effect of such injection has on equine msc immediate and delayed viability. we hypothesize that viability of equine msc is not correlated with needle diameter during aspiration and injection.


RESULTS
using a 3 ml syringe, manual injection of equine cord blood  or bone marrow-derived  msc with no needle and needles ranging in size from  <dig> to 30 ga did not affect immediate msc viability. similarly, 24 h post-injection, msc delayed viability was not different between any of the tested needles as determined by a resazurin-based proliferation assay. using a 3 ml syringe, aspiration of msc through  <dig>   <dig>  and 30 ga needles resulted in significant decreases in immediate viability with no change in delayed viability when compared to aspiration without a needle. bm- and cb-msc were observed to be of similar size with a diameter ± sd of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm, respectively. in comparison, the smallest needles,  have an internal diameter of 160 μm.


CONCLUSIONS
following injection, needle diameter did not affect immediate or delayed viability of equine msc. following aspiration through needles sizes 20 ga and smaller, immediate viability, but not delayed viability, decreased. as a result, an 18 ga or larger needle should be utilized for aspiration of cell suspensions. in contrast, needle selection for msc injection should be based on clinical preference and experience rather than concerns over decreasing msc viability.
