BACKGROUND
mammalian hepatic lipase  genes are transcribed almost exclusively in hepatocytes. the basis for this liver-restricted expression is not completely understood. we hypothesized that the responsible cis-acting elements are conserved among mammalian hl genes. to identify these elements, we made a genomic comparison of  <dig> kb of 5'-flanking region of the rat, mouse, rhesus monkey, and human hl genes. the in silico data were verified by promoter-reporter assays in transfected hepatoma hepg <dig> and non-hepatoma hela cells using serial 5'-deletions of the rat hl  and human hl  promoter region.


RESULTS
highly conserved elements were present at the proximal promoter region, and at  <dig> and  <dig> kb upstream of the transcriptional start site. both of these upstream elements increased transcriptional activity of the human hl  promoter region 2– <dig> fold. within the proximal hl promoter region, conserved clusters of transcription factor binding sites  were identified at -240/- <dig> , -80/- <dig> , and -25/+ <dig>  by the rvista software. in hepg <dig> cells, modules b and c, but not module a, were important for basal transcription. module b contains putative binding sites for hepatocyte nuclear factors hnf1α. in the presence of module b, transcription from the minimal hl promoter was increased  <dig> – <dig> fold in hepg <dig> cells, but inhibited 2– <dig> fold in hela cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate that searching for conserved non-coding sequences by comparative genomics is a valuable tool in identifying candidate enhancer elements. with this approach, we found two putative enhancer elements in the far upstream region of the hl gene. in addition, we obtained evidence that the -80/- <dig> region of the hl gene is responsible for enhanced hl promoter activity in hepatoma cells, and for silencing hl promoter activity in non-liver cells.
