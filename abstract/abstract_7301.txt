BACKGROUND
bovine herpesvirus  <dig>  is a member of the subfamily alphaherpesvirinae responsible for meningo-encephalitis in young cattle. the first case of bovine meningo-encephalitis associated with a herpesvirus infection was reported in australia. the current geographical distribution of bohv- <dig> infection is mainly restricted to south america, especially brazil and argentina. outbreaks of bohv- <dig> are regularly observed in argentina suggesting the circulation of the virus in the bovine population.


RESULTS
seventeen field strains of bohv- <dig> isolated from  <dig> to now were confirmed by differential pcr and subjected to restriction endonuclease analysis . viral dna was cleaved with bsteii which allows the differentiation among subtypes a, b and non a, non b. according to the rea with bsteii, only one field strain showed a pattern similar to the argentinean a <dig> strain . all other isolates showed a clear pattern similar to the australian n <dig> strain  consistent with the subtypes observed in brazil, the other south-american country where bohv- <dig> is known to be prevalent. the genomic region of subtype b responsible for the distinct pattern was determined and amplified by pcr; specifically a point mutation was identified in glycoprotein b gene, on the bsteii restriction site, which generates the profile specific of bohv-5b.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of circulation of bohv-5a in argentina as the prevailing subtype. therefore the circulation of bohv-5b was restricted to a few years in argentina, speculating that this subtype was not able to be maintained in the bovine population. the mutation in the gb gene is associated with the difference in the restriction patterns between subtypes "a" and "b".
