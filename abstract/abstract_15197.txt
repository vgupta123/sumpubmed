BACKGROUND
oxidative stress is involved in cisplatin-nephrotoxicity. however, it has not completely established if reactive nitrogen species and nitrosative stress are involved in this experimental model. the purpose of this work was to study the role of peroxynitrite, a reactive nitrogen specie, in cisplatin-nephrotoxicity using the compound  <dig> , <dig> -tetrakis  porphyrinato iron  , a soluble complex able to metabolize peroxynitrite.


RESULTS
in rats treated with cisplatin , renal nitrosative stress was made evident by the increase in 3-nitrotyrosine on day  <dig>  in addition, cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity was evident by the histological damage of proximal tubular cells and by the increase in  serum creatinine,  blood urea nitrogen, and  urinary excretion of n-acetyl-Î²-d-glucosaminidase and total protein. cisplatin-induced nitrosative stress and nephrotoxicity were attenuated by fetpps-treatment .


CONCLUSIONS
nitrosative stress is involved in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. our data suggest that peroxynitrite is involved, at least in part, in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and protein nitration.
