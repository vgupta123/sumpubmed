BACKGROUND
composting is one of the methods utilised in recycling organic communal waste. the composting process is dependent on aerobic microbial activity and proceeds through a succession of different phases each dominated by certain microorganisms. in this study, a ligation-detection-reaction  based microarray method was adapted for species-level detection of compost microbes characteristic of each stage of the composting process. ldr utilises the specificity of the ligase enzyme to covalently join two adjacently hybridised probes. a zip-oligo is attached to the 3'-end of one probe and fluorescent label to the 5'-end of the other probe. upon ligation, the probes are combined in the same molecule and can be detected in a specific location on a universal microarray with complementary zip-oligos enabling equivalent hybridisation conditions for all probes. the method was applied to samples from nordic composting facilities after testing and optimisation with fungal pure cultures and environmental clones.


RESULTS
probes targeted for fungi were able to detect  <dig>  fmol of target ribosomal pcr product in an artificial reaction mixture containing  <dig> ng competing fungal ribosomal internal transcribed spacer  area or herring sperm dna. the detection level was therefore approximately  <dig> % of total dna. clone libraries were constructed from eight compost samples. the ldr microarray results were in concordance with the clone library sequencing results. in addition a control probe was used to monitor the per-spot hybridisation efficiency on the array.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that the ldr microarray method is capable of sensitive and accurate species-level detection from a complex microbial community. the method can detect key species from compost samples, making it a basis for a tool for compost process monitoring in industrial facilities.
