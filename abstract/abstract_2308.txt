BACKGROUND
whitefly  causes extensive crop damage throughout the world by feeding directly on plants and by vectoring hundreds of species of begomoviruses. yet little is understood about its genes involved in development, insecticide resistance, host range plasticity and virus transmission.


RESULTS
to facilitate research on whitefly, we present a method for de novo assembly of whitefly transcriptome using short read sequencing technology . in a single run, we produced more than  <dig> million sequencing reads. these reads were assembled into  <dig>  unique sequences  which represent more than 10-fold of all the whitefly sequences deposited in the genbank . based on similarity search with known proteins, these analyses identified  <dig>  sequences with a cut-off e-value above 10- <dig>  assembled sequences were annotated with gene descriptions, gene ontology and clusters of orthologous group terms. in addition, we investigated the transcriptome changes during whitefly development using a tag-based digital gene expression  system. we obtained a sequencing depth of over  <dig>  million tags per sample and identified a large number of genes associated with specific developmental stages and insecticide resistance.


CONCLUSIONS
our data provides the most comprehensive sequence resource available for whitefly study and demonstrates that the illumina sequencing allows de novo transcriptome assembly and gene expression analysis in a species lacking genome information. we anticipate that next generation sequencing technologies hold great potential for the study of the transcriptome in other non-model organisms.
