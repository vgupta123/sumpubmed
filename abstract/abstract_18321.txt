BACKGROUND
rhipicephalus  spp. ticks economically impact on cattle production in africa and other tropical and subtropical regions of the world. tick vaccines constitute a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to tick control. the r. microplus bm <dig> protective antigen has been produced by recombinant dna technology and shown to protect cattle against tick infestations.


RESULTS
in this study, the genes for bm <dig> , ba <dig>  and bd <dig>  were cloned and characterized from african or asian tick strains and the recombinant proteins were secreted and purified from p. pastoris. the secretion of recombinant bm <dig> ortholog proteins in p. pastoris allowed for a simple purification process rendering a final product with high recovery  and purity  and likely to result in a more reproducible conformation closely resembling the native protein. rabbit immunization experiments with recombinant proteins showed immune cross-reactivity between bm <dig> ortholog proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
these experiments support the development and testing of vaccines containing recombinant bm <dig>  ba <dig> and bd <dig> secreted in p. pastoris for the control of tick infestations in africa.
