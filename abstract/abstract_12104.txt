BACKGROUND
in crosses between the proline-deficient mutant homozygous for p5cs <dig> and heterozygous for p5cs <dig> , used as male, and different arabidopsis mutants, used as females, the p5cs <dig> mutant allele was rarely transmitted to the outcrossed progeny, suggesting that the fertility of the male gametophyte carrying mutations in both p5cs <dig> and p5cs <dig> is severely compromised.


RESULTS
to confirm the fertility defects of pollen from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> mutants, transmission of mutant alleles through pollen was tested in two ways. first, the number of progeny inheriting a dominant sulfadiazine resistance marker linked to p5cs <dig> was determined. second, the number of p5cs2/p5cs <dig> embryos was determined. a ratio of resistant to susceptible plantlets close to 50%, and the absence of aborted embryos were consistent with the hypothesis that the male gametophyte carrying both p5cs <dig> and p5cs <dig> alleles is rarely transmitted to the offspring. in addition, in reciprocal crosses with wild type, about 50% of the p5cs <dig> mutant alleles were transmitted to the sporophytic generation when p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> was used as a female, while less than 1% of the p5cs <dig> alleles could be transmitted to the outcrossed progeny when p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> was used as a male. morphological and functional analysis of mutant pollen revealed a population of small, degenerated, and unviable pollen grains, indicating that the mutant homozygous for p5cs <dig> and heterozygous for p5cs <dig> is impaired in pollen development, and suggesting a role for proline in male gametophyte development. consistent with these findings, we found that pollen from p5cs <dig> homozygous mutants, display defects similar to, but less pronounced than pollen from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> mutants. finally, we show that pollen from p5cs <dig> p5cs2/p5cs <dig> plants contains less proline than wild type and that exogenous proline supplied from the beginning of another development can partially complement both morphological and functional pollen defects.


CONCLUSIONS
our data show that the development of the male gametophyte carrying mutations in both p5cs <dig> and p5cs <dig> is severely compromised, and indicate that proline is required for pollen development and transmission.
