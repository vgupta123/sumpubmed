BACKGROUND
biotin is an essential enzyme cofactor that acts as a co <dig> carrier in carboxylation and decarboxylation reactions. the e. coli genome encodes a biosynthetic pathway that produces biotin from pimeloyl-coa in four enzymatic steps. the final step, insertion of sulfur into desthiobiotin to form biotin, is catalyzed by the biotin synthase, biob. a dedicated biotin ligase  catalyzes the covalent attachment of biotin to biotin-dependent enzymes. isotopic labeling has been a valuable tool for probing the details of the biosynthetic process and assaying the activity of biotin-dependent enzymes, however there is currently no established method for 35s labeling of biotin.


RESULTS
in this study, we produced -biotin from na35so <dig> and desthiobiotin with a specific activity of  <dig>  ci/mmol, two orders of magnitude higher than previously published methods. the biotinylation domain  from the plasmodium falciparum acetyl-coa carboxylase  was expressed in e. coli as a biotinylation substrate. we found that overexpression of the e. coli biotin synthase, biob, and biotin ligase, bira, increased pfbccp- <dig> biotinylation 160-fold over basal levels. biotinylated pfbccp- <dig> was purified by affinity chromatography, and free biotin was liberated using acid hydrolysis. we verified that we had produced radiolabeled biologically active -biotin that specifically labels biotinylated proteins through reuptake in e. coli.


CONCLUSIONS
the strategy described in our report provides a simple and effective method for the production of -biotin in e. coli based on affinity chromatography.
