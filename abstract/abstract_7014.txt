BACKGROUND
going from a gene sequence to its function in the context of a whole organism requires a strategy for targeting mutations, referred to as reverse genetics. reverse genetics is highly desirable in the modern genomics era; however, the most powerful methods are generally restricted to a few model organisms. previously, we introduced a reverse-genetic strategy with the potential for general applicability to organisms that lack well-developed genetic tools. our tilling  method uses chemical mutagenesis followed by screening for single-base changes to discover induced mutations that alter protein function. tilling was shown to be an effective reverse genetic strategy by the establishment of a high-throughput tilling facility and the delivery of thousands of point mutations in hundreds of arabidopsis genes to members of the plant biology community.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that high-throughput tilling is applicable to maize, an important crop plant with a large genome but with limited reverse-genetic resources currently available. we screened pools of dna samples for mutations in 1-kb segments from  <dig> different genes, obtaining  <dig> independent induced mutations from a population of  <dig> pollen-mutagenized maize plants. one of the genes targeted was the dmt <dig> chromomethylase gene, for which we obtained an allelic series of three missense mutations that are predicted to be strongly deleterious.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate that tilling is a broadly applicable and efficient reverse-genetic strategy. we are establishing a public tilling service for maize modeled on the existing arabidopsis tilling project.
