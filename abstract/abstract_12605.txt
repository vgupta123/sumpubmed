BACKGROUND
despite rapid progress in understanding the mechanisms that shape the evolution of proteins, the relative importance of various factors remain to be elucidated. in this study, we have assessed the effects of  <dig> different biological features on the evolutionary rates  of protein-coding sequences in bacterial genomes.


RESULTS
our analysis of  <dig> bacterial species revealed new correlations between ers and constraining factors. previous studies have suggested that transcriptional abundance overwhelmingly constrains the evolution of yeast protein sequences. this transcriptional abundance leads to selection against misfolding or misinteractions. in this study we found that there was no single factor in determining the evolution of bacterial proteins. not only transcriptional abundance , but also protein-protein associations , essentiality , subcellular localization of cytoplasmic membrane , transmembrane helices  and hydropathicity score  independently and significantly affected the ers of bacterial proteins. in some species, ppa and ess demonstrate higher correlations with er than transcriptional abundance.


CONCLUSIONS
different forces drive the evolution of protein sequences in yeast and bacteria. in bacteria, the constraints are involved in avoiding a build-up of toxic molecules caused by misfolding/misinteraction , while retaining important functions  and maintaining the cell membrane . each of these independently contributes to the variation in protein evolution.
