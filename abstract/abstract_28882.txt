BACKGROUND
microenvironments called niches maintain resident stem cell populations by balancing self-renewal with differentiation, but the genetic regulation of this process is unclear. the niche of the drosophila testis is well-characterized and genetically tractable, making it ideal for investigating the molecular regulation of stem cell biology. the jak/stat pathway, activated by signals from a niche component called the hub, maintains both germline and somatic stem cells.


RESULTS
this study investigated the molecular regulation of the jak/stat pathway in the stem cells of the drosophila testis. we determined that the transcriptional regulator apontic  acts in the somatic  stem cells  to balance differentiation and maintenance. we found apt functions as a negative feedback inhibitor of stat activity, which enables cyst cell maturation. simultaneous loss of the stat regulators apt and socs36e, or the stat92e-targeting microrna mir- <dig>  expanded the somatic stem cell-like population.


CONCLUSIONS
genetic analysis revealed that a conserved genetic regulatory network limits jak/stat activity in the somatic stem cells of drosophila testis. in these cells, we determined jak/stat signaling promotes apt expression. then, apt functions through socs36e and mir- <dig> to attenuate pathway activation, which is required for timely cysc differentiation. we propose that apt acts as a core component of a stat-regulatory circuit to prevent stem cell overpopulation and allow stem cell maturation.
