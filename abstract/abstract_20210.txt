BACKGROUND
protein phosphatase one  is a ubiquitously expressed, highly conserved protein phosphatase that dephosphorylates target protein serine and threonine residues. pp <dig> is localized to its site of action by interacting with targeting or regulatory proteins, a majority of which contains a primary docking site referred to as the rvxf/w motif.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that a peptide based on the rvxf/w motif can effectively displace pp <dig> bound proteins from pp <dig> retained on the phosphatase affinity matrix microcystin-sepharose. subsequent co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that each identified binding protein was either a direct pp <dig> interactor or was in a complex that contains pp <dig>  our results have linked pp <dig> to numerous new nuclear functions and proteins, including ki- <dig>  rif- <dig>  topoisomerase iiÎ±, several nuclear helicases, nup <dig> and the trrap complex.


CONCLUSIONS
this modification of the microcystin-sepharose technique offers an effective means of purifying novel pp <dig> regulatory subunits and associated proteins and provides a simple method to uncover a link between pp <dig> and additional cellular processes.
