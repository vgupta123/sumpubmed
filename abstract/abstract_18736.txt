BACKGROUND
wild soybean  is a highly adaptive plant species which can grow well in saline-alkaline soils. in soybean genome, there exist about  <dig> hd-zip  genes. hd-zip transcription factor family is one of the largest plant specific superfamilies and plays important roles in response to abiotic stresses. although hd-zip transcription factors have been broadly reported to be involved in plant resistance to abiotic stresses like salt and drought, their roles in response to bicarbonate stress is largely unknown.


RESULTS
from our previous transcriptome profile analysis of wild soybean treated by 50 mm nahco <dig>  we identified an hd-zip gene  which showed high response to the alkaline stress. our result of qrt-pcr showed that the expression of gshdz <dig> was induced by alkaline stress  in both leaves and roots of wild soybean. overexpression of gshdz <dig> in arabidopsis resulted in enhanced tolerance to nahco <dig> and khco <dig> during the process of plant growth and development. however, the growths of transgenic and wt plants were not significantly different on the medium with high ph adjusted by koh, implicating gshdz <dig> is only responsible for resisting hco3− but not high ph. the transgenic plants had less mda contents but higher pod activities and chlorophyll contents than the wt plants. moreover, the transcript levels of stress-related genes, such as nadp-me, h+-ppase, rd29b and kin <dig> were increased with greater extent in the transgenic plants than the wild plants. on the contrary, gshdz <dig> overexpression lines were much sensitive to osmotic stress at seed germination and stocking stages compared to the wild plants.


CONCLUSIONS
we revealed that the important and special roles of gshdz <dig> in enhancing bicarbonate tolerance and responding to osmotic stress. it is the first time to elucidate these novel functions of hd-zip transcription factors. all the evidences broaden our understanding of functions of hd-zip family and provide clues for uncovering the mechanisms of high tolerance of wild soybean to saline-alkaline stresses.
