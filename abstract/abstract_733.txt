BACKGROUND
in a recent study it was demonstrated that a largely increased ovulation number is responsible for high prolificacy in two mouse lines selected for fertility performance. the objective of the present study was to identify genes that are involved in increasing the ovulation number in one of these lines, fl <dig>  for differential expression profiling, ovaries of fl <dig> and of a non-selected control line, duksi, both lines derived from the same genetic pool, were analyzed with microarray analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction . ovaries from  <dig> animals of each line were collected at the metestrous stage, combined to  <dig> pools each, and processed for microarray analysis.


RESULTS
the actual number of ova shed in fl <dig> exceeded that of the duksi control line more than twofold .  <dig> differentially expressed ovarian transcripts could be identified,  <dig> of them up- and  <dig> down-regulated. of these,  <dig> significantly mapped to specific gene ontology  terms representing different biological processes as steroid metabolism, folliculogenesis, immune response, intracellular signal transduction , regulation of transcription and translation, cell cycle and others. qpcr was used to re-evaluate selected transcripts and to estimate inter-individual variation of expression levels. these data significantly correlated with microarray data in  <dig> out of  <dig> selected transcripts but revealed partly large variations of expression levels between individuals.


CONCLUSIONS
 the abundance of numerous ovarian transcripts was significantly different in fl <dig> compared to the non-selected control line duksi thus suggesting that at least some of the respective genes and corresponding biological processes are involved in improving reproductive traits, particularly by increasing the number of ovulation.  selective qpcr re-evaluation largely confirmed the microarray data and in addition demonstrated that sample pooling can be beneficial to find out group-specific expression profiles despite of large inter-individual variation.  the present data will substantially help ongoing genetic association studies to identify candidate genes and causative mutations responsible for increased fertility performance in mice.
