BACKGROUND
the mycobacterium tuberculosis 19-kda lipoprotein has been reported to stimulate both t and b cell responses as well as induce a number of th <dig> cytokines. in order to evaluate the mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis  19-kda lipoprotein as an immunomodulator in cattle with johne's disease, the gene encoding the 19-kda protein  was analyzed.


RESULTS
map0261c is conserved in mycobacteria, showing a 95% amino acid identity in m. avium subspecies avium, 84% in m. intracellulare and 76% in m. bovis and m. tuberculosis. map0261c was cloned, expressed, and purified as a fusion protein with the maltose-binding protein  in escherichia coli. ifn-γ production was measured from  <dig> naturally infected and  <dig> control cattle after peripheral blood mononuclear cells  were stimulated with a whole cell lysate  of m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis or the recombinant mbp- <dig> kda. overall, the mean response to mbp- <dig> kda was not as strong as the mean response to the wcl. by comparison, cells from control, non-infected cattle did not produce ifn-γ after stimulation with either wcl or mbp- <dig> kda. to assess the humoral immune response to the 19-kda protein, sera from cattle with clinical johne's disease were used in immunoblot analysis. reactivity to mbp- <dig> kda protein, but not mbp alone, was observed in  <dig> of  <dig> infected cattle. antibodies to the 19-kda protein were not observed in  <dig> of  <dig> control cows.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, these results demonstrate that while the 19-kda protein from m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis stimulates a humoral immune response and weak ifn-γ production in infected cattle, the elicited responses are not strong enough to be used in a sensitive diagnostic assay.
