BACKGROUND
forty dogs presented for brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome with laryngeal collapse not over 1st degree  underwent glottis endoscopic and radiographic skull measurements before surgery. fifteen pugs, fifteen french and ten english bulldogs were included. the goals were prospectively to compare three common brachycephalic breeds for anatomical differences regarding glottis and skull measurements, and to assess if any correlation between glottis and skull measurements was present. linear measurements were used to obtain glottis and skull indices. correlations between glottis and skull indices and glottic measurements were evaluated. finally, glottis indices were compared among the three breeds.


RESULTS
no correlation was found for glottis and skull indices. the glottic index differed among the three breeds , ultimately representing a morphologic indicator of the different larynx shape in the three breeds .


CONCLUSIONS
the lack of correlation between skull/glottic indices does not support skull morphology as predictor of glottic morphology. as pugs had the lowest glottic index, it may be speculated that pugsâ€™ original narrow glottic width may predispose to further progressive respiratory deterioration more easily than in the other two breeds.
