BACKGROUND
eleven new human polyomaviruses  have been identified in the last decade. serological studies show that these novel hpyvs sub-clinically infect humans at an early age. the routes of infection, entry pathways, and cell tropism of new hpyvs remain unknown. vp <dig> proteins of polyomaviruses can assembly into virus-like particles . as cell culturing systems for hpyv are currently not available, vp1-derived vlps may be useful tools in basic research and biotechnological applications.


RESULTS
recombinant vp1-derived vlps from  <dig> newly identified hpyvs were efficiently expressed in yeast. vp <dig> proteins derived from merkel cell polyomavirus , trichodysplasia spinulosa-associated polyomavirus , and new jersey polyomavirus  self-assembled into homogeneous similarly-sized vlps. karolinska institutet polyomavirus , hpyv <dig>  hpyv <dig>  hpyv <dig>  and st. louis polyomavirus  vp <dig> proteins formed vlps that varied in size with diameters ranging from  <dig> to 60 nm. smaller-sized vlps  predominated in preparations from washington university polyomavirus  and hpyv <dig>  attempts to express recombinant hpyv <dig> vp1-derived vlps in yeast indicate that translation of vp <dig> might start at the second of two potential translation initiation sites in the vp1-encoding open reading frame . this translation resulted in a 364-amino acid-long vp <dig> protein, which efficiently self-assembled into typical pyv vlps. mcpyv-, kipyv-, tspyv-, hpyv9-, hpyv10-, and hpyv12-derived vlps showed hemagglutination  assay activity in guinea pig erythrocytes, whereas wupyv-, hpyv6-, hpyv7-, stlpyv- and njpyv-derived vp <dig> vlps did not.


CONCLUSIONS
the yeast expression system was successfully utilized for high-throughput production of recombinant vp1-derived vlps from  <dig> newly identified hpyvs. hpyv <dig> vp1-derived vlps were generated from the second of two potential translation initiation sites in the vp1-encoding orf. recombinant vlps produced in yeast originated from different hpyvs demonstrated distinct ha activities and may be useful in virus diagnostics, capsid structure studies, or investigation of entry pathways and cell tropism of hpyvs until cell culture systems for new hpyvs are developed.
