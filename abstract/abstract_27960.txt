BACKGROUND
visualization of data generated by high-throughput, high-dimensionality experiments is rapidly becoming a rate-limiting step in computational biology. there is an ongoing need to quickly develop high-quality visualizations that can be easily customized or incorporated into automated pipelines. this often requires an interface for manual plot modification, rapid cycles of tweaking visualization parameters, and the generation of graphics code. to facilitate this process for the generation of highly-customizable, high-resolution venn and euler diagrams, we introduce venndiagramweb: a web application for the widely used venndiagram r package. venndiagramweb is hosted at http://venndiagram.res.oicr.on.ca/.


RESULTS
venndiagramweb allows real-time modification of venn and euler diagrams, with parameter setting through a web interface and immediate visualization of results. it allows customization of essentially all aspects of figures, but also supports integration into computational pipelines via download of r code. users can upload data and download figures in a range of formats, and there is exhaustive support documentation.


CONCLUSIONS
venndiagramweb allows the easy creation of venn and euler diagrams for computational biologists, and indeed many other fields. its ability to support real-time graphics changes that are linked to downloadable code that can be integrated into automated pipelines will greatly facilitate the improved visualization of complex datasets. for application support please contact paul.boutros@oicr.on.ca.
