BACKGROUND
a verb's argument structure defines the number and relationships of participants needed for a complete event. one-argument  verbs require only a subject to make a complete sentence, while two- and three-argument verbs  normally take direct and indirect objects. cortical responses to verbs embedded into sentences  indicate the processing of the verb's argument structure in the human brain. the two experiments of the present study examined whether and how this processing is reflected in distinct spatio-temporal cortical response patterns to isolated verbs and/or verbs presented in minimal context.


RESULTS
the magnetoencephalogram was recorded while  <dig> native german-speaking adults saw  <dig> german verbs, presented one at a time for  <dig> ms each in experiment  <dig>  verb-evoked electromagnetic responses at  <dig> â€“  <dig> ms after stimulus onset, analyzed in source space, were higher in the left middle temporal gyrus for verbs that take only one argument, relative to two- and three-argument verbs. in experiment  <dig>  the same verbs  were preceded by a proper name specifying the subject of the verb. this produced additional activation between  <dig> and  <dig> ms in or near the left inferior frontal gyrus, activity being larger and peaking earlier for one-argument verbs that required no further arguments to form a complete sentence.


CONCLUSIONS
localization of sources of activity suggests that the activation in temporal and frontal regions varies with the degree by which representations of an event as a part of the verbs' semantics are completed during parsing.
