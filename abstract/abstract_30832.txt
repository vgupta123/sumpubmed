BACKGROUND
slow-adapting type i  afferents deliver sensory signals to the somatosensory cortex during low-frequency  mechanical stimulation. it has been reported that the somatosensory projection from sa-i afferents is effective and reliable for object grasping and manipulation. despite a large number of neuroimaging studies on cortical activation responding to tactile stimuli mediated by sa-i afferents, how sensory information of such tactile stimuli flows over the somatosensory cortex remains poorly understood. in this study, we investigated tactile information processing of pressure stimuli between the primary  and secondary  somatosensory cortices by measuring effective connectivity using dynamic causal modeling . we applied pressure stimuli for  <dig> s to the right index fingertip of healthy participants and acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging  data using a 3t mri system.


RESULTS
dcm analysis revealed intra-hemispheric effective connectivity between the contralateral si  and sii  characterized by both parallel  and serial  pathways during pressure stimulation. dcm analysis also revealed inter-hemispheric effective connectivity among csi, csii, and the ipsilateral sii  characterized by serial  and sii-level  pathways during pressure stimulation.


CONCLUSIONS
our results support a hierarchical somatosensory network that underlies processing of low-frequency tactile information. the network consists of parallel inputs to both csi and csii , followed by serial pathways from csi to csii  and from csii to isii . importantly, our results suggest that both serial and parallel processing take place in tactile information processing of static mechanical stimuli as well as highlighting the contribution of callosal transfer to bilateral neuronal interactions in sii.
