BACKGROUND
the genomic organisation of the major histocompatibility complex  varies greatly between different vertebrates. in mammals, the classical mhc consists of a large number of linked genes  with predominantly immune function. in some birds, it consists of only a small number of linked mhc core genes  forming a minimal essential mhc and, in fish, the mhc consists of a so far unknown number of genes including non-linked mhc core genes. here we report a survey of mhc genes and their paralogues in the zebrafish genome.


RESULTS
using sequence similarity searches against the zebrafish draft genome assembly ,  <dig> putative mhc gene loci and their paralogues have been identified. of these,  <dig> map to chromosome  <dig> while the remaining loci are spread across essentially all chromosomes. despite the fragmentation, a set of mhc core genes involved in peptide transport, loading and presentation are still found in a single linkage group.


CONCLUSIONS
the results extend the linkage information of mhc core genes on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> and show the distribution of the remaining mhc genes and their paralogues to be genome-wide. although based on a draft genome assembly, this survey demonstrates an essentially fragmented mhc in zebrafish.
