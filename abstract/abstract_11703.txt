BACKGROUND
interleukin- <dig>  has an important anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory function, and its expression is negatively correlated with the development and severity of allergic rhinitis . however, the in vivo effects of exogenous il- <dig> on ar have not been studied and the mechanisms underlying the effects of il- <dig> have not been fully understood. here, we investigated the effects of intranasal administration of recombinant mouse  il- <dig> on the expression of th responses and local il- <dig> in a mouse model of ar induced by ovalbumin.


RESULTS
administration of rmil- <dig> during challenge significantly reduced the number of eosinophils and mast cells, as well as type  <dig> helper t  and th <dig> cell related cytokine and transcription factor levels in the nasal mucosa and nasal lavage fluid in ar mice. the rmil- <dig> treatment significantly inhibited the number of il-10-positive cells and il- <dig> mrna expression in the nasal mucosa in ar mice.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that exogenous il- <dig> administrated in challenge phase alleviates nasal allergic inflammation in ar mice, most likely by inhibiting th <dig> and th <dig> responses. it can also inhibit local il- <dig> levels in the nasal mucosa. our findings indicate that il- <dig> may have the potential as an inhibitor of ar.
