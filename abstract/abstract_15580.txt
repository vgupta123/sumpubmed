BACKGROUND
one of the central issues in microbial ecology is to understand the parameters that drive diversity. among these parameters, size has often been considered to be the main driver in many different ecosystems. surprisingly, the influence of size on gut microbial diversity has not yet been investigated, and so far in studies reported in the literature only the influences of age, diet, phylogeny and digestive tract structures have been considered. this study explicitly challenges the underexplored relationship connecting gut volume and bacterial diversity.


RESULTS
the bacterial diversity of  <dig> faeces produced by  <dig> vertebrate species covering a body mass range of  <dig>  log. the animals comprised mammals, birds and reptiles. the diversity was evaluated based on the simpson diversity index extracted from 16s rdna gene fingerprinting patterns. diversity presented an increase along with animal body mass following a power law with a slope z of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , whatever the age, phylogeny, diet or digestive tract structure.


CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here suggest that gut volume cannot be neglected as a major driver of gut microbial diversity. the characteristics of the gut microbiota follow general principles of biogeography that arise in many ecological systems.
