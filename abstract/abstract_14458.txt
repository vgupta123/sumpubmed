BACKGROUND
alpk <dig>  is a member of an unconventional alpha-kinase family, and its biological function remains largely unknown. here we report the phenotypic characterization of one mutant line, in which the piggybac  transposon is inserted into the alpk <dig> gene.


RESULTS
the piggybac insertion site in mutants was mapped to the first intron of the alpk <dig> gene, resulting in the effective disruption of the intact alpk <dig> transcript expression. the transposon-inserted alpk <dig> homozygous mutants  displayed severe defects in motor coordination in a series of behavioral analysis, including dowel test, hanging wire test, rotarod analysis and footprint analysis. however, the cerebellar architecture, purkinje cell morphology and electrophysiology of the purkinje cells appeared normal in mutants. the motor coordination deficits in the alpk1pb/pb mice were rescued by transgenic mice expressing the full-length alpk1-coding sequence under the control of the ubiquitous expression promoter.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that alpk <dig> plays an important role in the regulation of motor coordination. alpk1pb/pb mice would be a useful model to provide a clue to the better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of alpk <dig> in the control of fine motor activities.
