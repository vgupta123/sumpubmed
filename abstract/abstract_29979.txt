BACKGROUND
classical swine fever virus  infection causes significant losses of pigs, which is characterized by hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation and leucopenia. the swine vascular endothelial cell is a primary target cell for csfv. the aim of this study was to determine the role of csfv infection in inducing oxidative stress  in vascular endothelial cells.


RESULTS
we demonstrated that csfv infection induced oxidative stress in swine umbilical vein endothelial cells , characterized by the induction of reactive oxygen species  production and the elevations of porcine antioxidant proteins thioredoxin , peroxiredoxin- <dig>  and heme oxygenase- <dig>  expression. furthermore, cyclooxygenase- <dig> , a pro-inflammatory protein related to oxidative stress, was up-regulated while anti-inflammatory protein peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ , an important mediator in vascular functional regulation, was down-regulated in the csfv infected cells. in addition, antioxidants showed significant inhibitory effects on the csfv replication, indicating a close relationship between csfv replication and os induced in the host cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicated that csfv infection induced oxidative stress in suvecs. these findings provide novel information on the mechanism by which csfv can alter intracellular events associated with the viral infection.
