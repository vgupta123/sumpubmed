BACKGROUND
the yac <dig> model of huntington’s disease  shows substantial deficits in motor, learning and memory tasks and alterations in its transcriptional profile. we examined the changes in the transcriptional profile in the yac <dig> mouse model of hd at  <dig>   <dig> and 18 months and compared these with those seen in other models and human hd caudate.


RESULTS
differential gene expression by genotype showed that genes related to neuronal function, projection outgrowth and cell adhesion were altered in expression. a time-course anova revealed that genes downregulated with increased age in wild-type striata were likely to be downregulated in the yac <dig> striata. there was a substantial overlap of concordant gene expression changes in the yac <dig> striata compared with those in human hd brain. changes in gene expression over time showed fewer striatal yac <dig> rnas altered in abundance than in the hdhq <dig> striata but there was a very marked overlap in transcriptional changes at all time points. despite the similarities in striatal expression changes at 18 months the hdhq <dig> mice showed widespread mhtt and ubiquitin positive inclusion staining in the striatum whereas this was absent in the yac <dig> striatum.


CONCLUSIONS
the gene expression changes in yac <dig> striata show a very closely matched profile to that of hdhq <dig> striata and are already significantly different between genotypes by six months of age, implying that the temporal molecular gene expression profiles of these models match very closely, despite differences in the prevalence of brain inclusion formation between the models. the yac <dig> gene expression changes appear to correlate well with gene expression differences caused by ageing. a relatively small number of genes showed significant differences in expression between the striata of the two models and these could explain some of the phenotypic differences between the models.
