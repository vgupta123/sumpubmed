BACKGROUND
the ability to selectively alter genomic dna sequences in vivo is a powerful tool for basic and applied research. the crispr/cas <dig> system precisely mutates dna sequences in a number of organisms. here, the crispr/cas <dig> system is shown to be effective in soybean by knocking-out a green fluorescent protein  transgene and modifying nine endogenous loci.


RESULTS
targeted dna mutations were detected in 95% of  <dig> hairy-root transgenic events analyzed. bi-allelic mutations were detected in events transformed with eight of the nine targeting vectors. small deletions were the most common type of mutation produced, although snps and short insertions were also observed. homoeologous genes were successfully targeted singly and together, demonstrating that crispr/cas <dig> can both selectively, and generally, target members of gene families. somatic embryo cultures were also modified to enable the production of plants with heritable mutations, with the frequency of dna modifications increasing with culture time. a novel cloning strategy and vector system based on in-fusion® cloning was developed to simplify the production of crispr/cas <dig> targeting vectors, which should be applicable for targeting any gene in any organism.


CONCLUSIONS
the crispr/cas <dig> is a simple, efficient, and highly specific genome editing tool in soybean. although some vectors are more efficient than others, it is possible to edit duplicated genes relatively easily. the vectors and methods developed here will be useful for the application of crispr/cas <dig> to soybean and other plant species.
