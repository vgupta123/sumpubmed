BACKGROUND
the apobec <dig>  genes play a key role in innate antiviral defense in mammals by introducing directed mutations in the dna. the human genome encodes for seven a <dig> genes, with multiple splice alternatives. different a <dig> proteins display different substrate specificity, but the very basic question on how discerning self from non-self still remains unresolved. further, the expression of a <dig> activity/ies shapes the way both viral and host genomes evolve.


RESULTS
we present here a detailed temporal analysis of the origin and expansion of the a <dig> repertoire in mammals. our data support an evolutionary scenario where the genome of the mammalian ancestor encoded for at least one ancestral a <dig> gene, and where the genome of the ancestor of placental mammals  already encoded for an a3z1-a3z2-a3z <dig> arrangement. duplication events of the a <dig> genes have occurred independently in different lineages: humans, cats and horses. in all of them, gene duplication has resulted in changes in enzyme activity and/or substrate specificity, in a paradigmatic example of convergent adaptive evolution at the genomic level. finally, our results show that evolutionary rates for the three a3z <dig>  a3z <dig> and a3z <dig> motifs have significantly decreased in the last  <dig> mya. the analysis constitutes a textbook example of the evolution of a gene locus by duplication and sub/neofunctionalization in the context of virus-host arms race.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide a time framework for identifying ancestral and derived genomic arrangements in the apobec loci, and to date the expansion of this gene family for different lineages through time, as a response to changes in viral/retroviral/retrotransposon pressure.
