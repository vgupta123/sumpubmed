BACKGROUND
one of the most common goals of hierarchical clustering is finding those branches of a tree that form quantifiably distinct data subtypes. achieving this goal in a statistically meaningful way requires  a measure of distinctness of a branch and  a test to determine the significance of the observed measure, applicable to all branches and across multiple scales of dissimilarity.


RESULTS
we formulate a method termed tree branches evaluated statistically for tightness  for identifying significantly distinct tree branches in hierarchical clusters. for each branch of the tree a measure of distinctness, or tightness, is defined as a rational function of heights, both of the branch and of its parent. a statistical procedure is then developed to determine the significance of the observed values of tightness. we test tbest as a tool for tree-based data partitioning by applying it to five benchmark datasets, one of them synthetic and the other four each from a different area of biology. for each dataset there is a well-defined partition of the data into classes. in all test cases tbest performs on par with or better than the existing techniques.


CONCLUSIONS
based on our benchmark analysis, tbest is a tool of choice for detection of significantly distinct branches in hierarchical trees grown from biological data. an r language implementation of the method is available from the comprehensive r archive network: http://www.cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tbest/index.html.
