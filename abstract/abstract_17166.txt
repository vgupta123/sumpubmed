BACKGROUND
soon after the first algorithms for rna folding became available, it was recognised that the prediction of only one energetically optimal structure is insufficient to achieve reliable results. an in-depth analysis of the folding space as a whole appeared necessary to deduce the structural properties of a given rna molecule reliably. folding space analysis comprises various methods such as suboptimal folding, computation of base pair probabilities, sampling procedures and abstract shape analysis. common to many approaches is the idea of partitioning the folding space into classes of structures, for which certain properties can be derived.


RESULTS
in this paper we extend the approach of abstract shape analysis. we show how to compute the accumulated probabilities of all structures that share the same shape. while this implies a complete  analysis of the folding space, the computational effort depends only on the size of the shape space, which is much smaller. this approach has been integrated into the tool rnashapes, and we apply it to various rnas.


CONCLUSIONS
analyses of conformational switches show the existence of two shapes with probabilities approximately 23
