BACKGROUND
the functional relevance of many of the recently detected jak <dig> mutations, except v617f and exon  <dig> mutants, in patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasia  has been significantly overlooked. to explore atomic-level explanations of the possible mutational effects from those overlooked mutants, we performed a set of molecular dynamics simulations on clinically observed mutants, including newly discovered mutations  and control mutants .


RESULTS
simulation results are consistent with all currently available clinical/experimental evidence. the simulation-derived putative interface, not possibly obtained from static models, between the kinase  and pseudokinase  domains of jak <dig> provides a platform able to explain the mutational effect for all mutants, including presumably benign control mutants, at the atomic level.


CONCLUSIONS
the results and analysis provide structural bases for mutational mechanisms of jak <dig>  may advance the understanding of jak <dig> auto-regulation, and have the potential to lead to therapeutic approaches. together with recent mutation profiling results demonstrating the breadth of clinically observed jak <dig> mutations, our findings suggest that molecular testing/diagnostics of jak <dig> should extend beyond v617f and exon  <dig> mutations, and perhaps should encompass most of the pseudo-kinase domain-coding region.
