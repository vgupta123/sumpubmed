BACKGROUND
an antibody with cross-reactivity can create unexpected side effects or false diagnostic reports if used for clinical purposes. ercc <dig> is being explored as a predictive diagnostic biomarker for cisplatin-based chemotherapy. high ercc <dig> expression is linked to drug resistance on cisplatin-based chemotherapy. 8f <dig> is one of the most commonly used monoclonal antibodies for evaluating ercc <dig> expression levels in lung cancer patient tissues, but it has been noted that this antibody cross-reacts with an unknown protein.


RESULTS
by using a high density protein microarray chip technology, we discovered that 8f <dig> not only reacts with its authentic target, ercc <dig>  but also cross-reacts with an unrelated nuclear membrane protein, pcyt1a. the cross-reactivity is due to a common epitope presented on these two unrelated proteins. similar to the subcellular localization of ercc <dig>  ihc tests demonstrated that pcyt1a is localized mainly on nuclear membrane. in this study, we also discovered that the pcyt1a gene expression level is significantly higher than the ercc <dig> gene expression level in a certain population of lung cancer patient tissue samples. to develop the best monoclonal antibody for ercc <dig> ihc analysis,  <dig> monoclonal antibodies were generated and  <dig> of them were screened against our protein microarray chip. two clones showed high mono-specificity on the protein microarray chip test and both worked for the ihc application.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the 8f <dig> clone is not suitable for ercc <dig> ihc assay due to its cross-reactivity with pcyt1a protein. two newly generated monoclonal antibodies, 4f <dig> and 2e <dig>  demonstrated ultra-specificity against ercc <dig> protein and superior performance for ihc analyses.
