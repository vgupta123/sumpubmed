BACKGROUND
antipsychotics are divided into typical and atypical compounds based on clinical efficacy and side effects. the purpose of this study was to characterize in vitro a series of novel azecine-type compounds at human dopamine d1-d <dig> and 5ht2a receptors and to assign them to different classes according to their dopamine/5ht2a receptor profile.


RESULTS
regardless of using affinity data  or selectivity data ), principal component analysis with azecine-type compounds, haloperidol, and clozapine revealed three groups of dopamine/5ht2a ligands: 1) haloperidol; 2) clozapine plus four azecine-type compounds; 3) two hydroxylated dibenzazecines. reducing the number of ki ratios used for principal component analysis from  <dig> to two  obtained the same three groups of compounds. the most potent dibenzazecine clustering in the same group as clozapine was the non-hydroxylated le <dig> which shows a slightly different d2-like receptor profile  than clozapine . the monohydroxylated dibenzacezine le <dig> clusters in a separate group from clozapine/le <dig> and from haloperidol and shows increased d <dig> selectivity.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, two compounds with a novel dopamine/5ht2a receptor profile, le <dig> and le <dig>  with some differences in their respective d1/d <dig> receptor affinities including a validated pharmacophore-based 3d-qsar model for d <dig> antagonists are presented.
