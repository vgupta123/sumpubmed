BACKGROUND
fae <dig>  is the key gene in the control of erucic acid synthesis in seeds of brassica species. due to oil with low erucic acid  content is essential for human health and not enough lea resource could be available, thus new lea genetic resources are being sought for brassica breeding. ecotilling, a powerful genotyping method, can readily be used to identify polymorphisms in brassica.


RESULTS
seven b. rapa, nine b. oleracea and  <dig> b. napus accessions were collected for identification of fae <dig> polymorphisms. three polymorphisms were detected in the two fae <dig> paralogues of b. napus using ecotilling and were found to be strongly associated with differences in the erucic acid contents of seeds. in genomic fae <dig> sequences obtained from seven b. rapa accessions, one snp in the coding region was deduced to cause loss of gene function. molecular evolution analysis of fae <dig> homologues showed that the relationship between the brassica a and c genomes is closer than that between the a/c genomes and arabidopsis genome. alignment of the coding sequences of these fae <dig> homologues indicated that  <dig> snps differed between the a and c genomes and could be used as genome-specific markers in brassica.


CONCLUSIONS
this study showed the applicability of ecotilling for detecting gene polymorphisms in brassica. the association between b. napus fae <dig> polymorphisms and the erucic acid contents of seeds may provide useful guidance for lea breeding. the discovery of the lea resource in b. rapa can be exploited in brasscia cultivation.
