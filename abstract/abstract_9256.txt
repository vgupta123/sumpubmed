BACKGROUND
the polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid , participates in neurotransmission involving activation of calcium-independent phospholipase a <dig> , which is coupled to muscarinic, cholinergic and serotonergic neuroreceptors. drug induced activation of ipla <dig> can be measured in vivo with quantitative autoradiography using 14c-dha as a probe. the present study used this approach to address whether a dha signal is produced following dompaminergic 2-like receptor activation with quinpirole in rat brain. unanesthetized rats were infused intravenously with 14c-dha one minute after saline or quinpirole infusion, and serial blood samples were collected over a 20-minute period to obtain plasma. the animals were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital and their brains excised, coronally dissected and subjected to quantitative autoradiography to derive the regional incorporation coefficient, k*, a marker of dha signaling. plasma labeled and unlabeled unesterified dha concentrations were measured.


RESULTS
the incorporation coefficient  for dha did not differ significantly between quinpirole-treated and control rats in any of  <dig> identified brain regions. plasma labeled dha concentration over the 20-minute collection period  and unlabeled unesterified dha concentration did not differ significantly between the two groups.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings demonstrate that d2-like receptor initiated signaling does not involve dha as a second messenger, and likely does not involve ipla <dig> activation.
