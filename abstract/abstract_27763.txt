BACKGROUND
epigenetic reading domains are involved in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin state by interacting with histones in a post-translational modification specific manner. a detailed knowledge of the target modifications of reading domains, including enhancing and inhibiting secondary modifications, will lead to a better understanding of the biological signaling processes mediated by reading domains.


RESULTS
we describe the application of celluspots peptide arrays which contain  <dig> histone peptides carrying  <dig> post translational modifications in different combinations as an inexpensive, reliable and fast method for initial screening for specific interactions of reading domains with modified histone peptides. to validate the method, we tested the binding specificities of seven known epigenetic reading domains on celluspots peptide arrays, viz. the hp1ÃŸ and mpp <dig> chromo domains, jmjd2a and 53bp <dig> tudor domains, dnmt3a pwwp domain, rag <dig> phd domain and brd <dig> bromo domain. in general, the binding results agreed with literature data with respect to the primary specificity of the reading domains, but in almost all cases we obtained additional new information concerning the influence of secondary modifications surrounding the target modification.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that celluspots peptide arrays are powerful screening tools for studying the specificity of putative reading domains binding to modified histone peptides.
