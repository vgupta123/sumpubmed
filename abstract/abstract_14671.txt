BACKGROUND
miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements  are expected to play important roles in evolution of genes and genome in plants, especially in the highly duplicated plant genomes. various mite families and their roles in plants have been characterized. however, there have been fewer studies of mite families and their potential roles in evolution of the recently triplicated brassica genome.


RESULTS
we identified a new mite family, brami- <dig>  belonging to the stowaway super-family in the brassica genome. in silico mapping revealed that  <dig> members are dispersed throughout the euchromatic regions of the b. rapa pseudo-chromosomes. among them,  <dig> members  are located in gene-rich regions, less than 3 kb from genes. in addition, we identified  <dig> and  <dig> members in the 470 mb and 15 mb genomic shotgun sequences currently available for b. oleracea and b. napus, respectively. the resulting estimated copy numbers for the entire genomes were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in b. rapa, b. oleracea and b. napus, respectively. concurrently, only  <dig> members of the related arabidopsis attirta- <dig> mite family were identified in the arabidopsis genome. phylogenetic analysis revealed that brami- <dig> elements proliferated in the brassica genus after divergence from the arabidopsis lineage. mite insertion polymorphism  was inspected for  <dig> brami- <dig> members, revealing high levels of insertion polymorphism between and within species of brassica that clarify brami- <dig> activation periods up to the present. comparative analysis of the  <dig> genes harbouring the brami- <dig> elements with their non-insertion paralogs  showed that the brami- <dig> insertions mainly reside in non-coding sequences and that the expression levels of genes with the elements differ from those of their nips.


CONCLUSIONS
a stowaway family mite, named as brami- <dig>  was gradually amplified and remained present in over than  <dig> copies in each of three brassica species. overall, 78% of the members were identified in gene-rich regions, and it is assumed that they may contribute to the evolution of duplicated genes in the highly duplicated brassica genome. the resulting mips can serve as a good source of dna markers for brassica crops because the insertions are highly dispersed in the gene-rich euchromatin region and are polymorphic between or within species.
