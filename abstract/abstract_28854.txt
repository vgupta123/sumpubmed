BACKGROUND
the rapid advancement of computer and information technology in recent years has resulted in the rise of e-learning technologies to enhance and complement traditional classroom teaching in many fields, including bioinformatics. this paper records the experience of implementing e-learning technology to support problem-based learning  in the teaching of two undergraduate bioinformatics classes in the national university of singapore.


RESULTS
survey results further established the efficiency and suitability of e-learning tools to supplement pbl in bioinformatics education.  <dig> % of year three bioinformatics students showed a positive response regarding the usefulness of the learning activity management system  e-learning tool in guiding the learning and discussion process involved in pbl and in enhancing the learning experience by breaking down pbl activities into a sequential workflow. on the other hand,  <dig> % of year two bioinformatics students indicated that their revision process was positively impacted with the use of lams for guiding the learning process, while  <dig> % agreed that the breakdown of activities into a sequential step-by-step workflow by lams enhances the learning experience


CONCLUSIONS
we show that e-learning tools are useful for supplementing pbl in bioinformatics education. the results suggest that it is feasible to develop and adopt e-learning tools to supplement a variety of instructional strategies in the future.
