BACKGROUND
retrodifferentiation and regained proliferative capacity of growth-arrested human leukemic cells after monocyte-like differentiation requires proteolytic activities together with distinct regulatory factors. the aaa atpase valosin-containing protein  contributes to protein degradation and cell cycle regulation, respectively, and it was of interest to study a possible role of vcp/p <dig> during this myelomonocytic differentiation and retrodifferentiation.


RESULTS
separation of autonomously proliferating human u <dig> myeloid leukemia cells by centrifugal elutriation demonstrated unaltered vcp/p <dig> expression levels throughout distinct phases of the cell cycle. however, phorbol ester-induced g0/g <dig> cell cycle arrest in differentiating human u <dig> leukemia cells was associated with a significantly increased protein and mrna amount of this aaa atpase. these elevated vcp/p <dig> levels progressively decreased again when growth-arrested u <dig> cells entered a retrodifferentiation program and returned to the tumorigenic phenotype. whereas vcp/p <dig> was observed predominantly in the cytosol of u <dig> tumor and retrodifferentiated cells, a significant nuclear accumulation appeared during differentiation and g0/g <dig> growth arrest. analysis of subcellular compartments by immunoprecipitations and 2d western blots substantiated these findings and revealed furthermore a tyrosine-specific phosphorylation of vcp/p <dig> in the cytosolic but not in the nuclear fractions. these altered tyrosine phosphorylation levels, according to distinct subcellular distributions, indicated a possible functional involvement of vcp/p <dig> in the leukemic differentiation process. indeed, a down-modulation of vcp/p <dig> protein by sirna revealed a reduced expression of differentiation-associated genes in subsequent dna microarray analysis. moreover, dna-binding and proliferation-associated genes, which are down-regulated during differentiation of the leukemic cells, demonstrated elevated levels in the vcp/p <dig> sirna transfectants.


CONCLUSIONS
the findings demonstrated that monocytic differentiation and g0/g <dig> growth arrest in human u <dig> leukemia cells was accompanied by an increase in vcp/p <dig> expression and a distinct subcellular distribution to be reverted during retrodifferentiation. together with a down-modulation of vcp/p <dig> by sirna, these results suggested an association of this aaa atpase in the differentiation/retrodifferentiation program.
