BACKGROUND
epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. seizure-induced tlr4/myd <dig> signaling plays a critical role in activating microglia and triggering neuron apoptosis. saha is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that regulates gene expression by increasing chromatin histone acetylation. in this study, we investigated the role of saha in tlr4/myd <dig> signaling in a rat seizure model.


RESULTS
sprague–dawley rats with kainic acid -induced seizures were treated with saha. the expression of tlr <dig>  myd <dig>  nf-κb p <dig> and il-1β in hippocampus was detected at hour  <dig> and  <dig> and day  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> post seizure. saha pretreatment increased seizure latency and decreased seizure scores. the expression levels of tlr <dig>  myd <dig>  nf-κb and il-1β increased significantly in both activated microglia and apoptotic neurons after ka treatment. the effects were attenuated by saha. chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that the h <dig> histone acetylation levels significantly decreased while h3k <dig> levels significantly increased in the ka treatment group. the h <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylation levels returned to control levels after saha  pretreatment. there was a positive correlation between the expression of tlr <dig> and the acetylation levels of h3k <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
histone deacetylase inhibitor saha can suppress seizure-induced tlr4/myd <dig> signaling and inhibit tlr <dig> gene expression through histone acetylation regulation. this suggests that saha may protect against seizure-induced brain damage.
