BACKGROUND
synaptic burst activation feeds back as a short-term depression of release probability at hippocampal ca3-ca <dig> synapses. this short-term synaptic plasticity requires functional astrocytes and it affects both the recently active  synapses  as well as inactive neighboring synapses . the aim of this study was to investigate and compare the components contributing to the depression of release probability in these two different scenarios.


RESULTS
when tested using paired-pulses, following a period of inactivity, the transient heterosynaptic depression was expressed as a reduction in the response to only the first pulse, whereas the response to the second pulse was unaffected. this selective depression of only the first response in a high-frequency burst was shared by the homosynaptic post-burst depression, but it was partially counteracted by augmentation at these recently active synapses. in addition, the expression of the homosynaptic post-burst depression included an astrocyte-mediated reduction of the pool of release-ready primed vesicles.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that activated astrocytes depress the release probability via two different mechanisms; by depression of vesicular release probability only at inactive synapses and by imposing a delay in the recovery of the primed pool of vesicles following depletion. these mechanisms restrict the expression of the astrocyte-mediated depression to temporal windows that are typical for synaptic burst activity.
