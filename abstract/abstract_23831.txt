BACKGROUND
mesenchymal stem cells  are pluripotent stem cells derived from bone marrow with secretory functions of various neurotrophic factors. stromal cell-derived factor-1α  is also reported as one of chemokines released from mscs. in this research, the therapeutic effects of mscs through sdf-1α were explored. 6-hydroxydopamine  was injected into the right striatum of female sd rats with subsequent administration of gfp-labeled mscs, fibroblasts,  or pbs at  <dig> hours after 6-ohda injection. all rats were evaluated behaviorally with cylinder test and amphetamine-induced rotation test for  <dig> month with consequent euthanasia for immunohistochemical evaluations. additionally, to explore the underlying mechanisms, neuroprotective effects of sdf-1α were explored using 6-ohda-exposed pc <dig> cells by using dopamine  assay and tdt-mediated dutp-biotin nick-end labeling  staining.


RESULTS
rats receiving msc transplantation significantly ameliorated behaviorally both in cylinder test and amphetamine-induced rotation test compared with the control groups. correspondingly, rats with mscs displayed significant preservation in the density of tyrosine hydroxylase -positive fibers in the striatum and the number of th-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta  compared to that of control rats. in the in vitro study, sdf-1α treatment increased da release and suppressed cell death induced by 6-ohda administration compared with the control groups.


CONCLUSIONS
consequently, msc transplantation might exert neuroprotection on 6-ohda-exposed dopaminergic neurons at least partly through anti-apoptotic effects of sdf-1α. the results demonstrate the potentials of intravenous msc administration for clinical applications, although further explorations are required.
