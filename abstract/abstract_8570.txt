BACKGROUND
inflammation is characterized by dynamic changes in the expression of cytokines, such as m-csf, and modifications of lipids and proteins that result in the formation of ligands for class a scavenger receptors . these changes are associated with altered sr-a expression in macrophages; however, the intracellular signal pathways involved and the extent to which sr-a ligands regulate sr-a expression are not well defined. to address these questions, sr-a expression and function were examined in resident mouse peritoneal macrophages incubated with m-csf or the selective sr-a ligand acetylated-ldl .


RESULTS
m-csf increased sr-a expression and function, and required the specific activation of p <dig> mapk, but not erk1/ <dig> or jnk. increased sr-a expression and function returned to basal levels  <dig> hours after removing m-csf. we next determined whether prolonged incubation of macrophages with sr-a ligand alters sr-a expression. in contrast to most receptors, which are down-regulated by chronic exposure to ligand, sr-a expression was reversibly increased by incubating macrophages with acldl. acldl activated p <dig> in wild-type macrophages but not in sr-a-/- macrophages, and p <dig> activation was specifically required for acldl-induced sr-a expression.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate that in resident macrophages sr-a expression and function can be dynamically regulated by changes in the macrophage microenvironment that are typical of inflammatory processes. in particular, our results indicate a previously unrecognized role for ligand binding to sr-a in up-regulating sr-a expression and activating p <dig> mapk. in this way, sr-a may modulate inflammatory responses by enhancing macrophage uptake of modified protein/lipid, bacteria, and cell debris; and by regulating the production of inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and proteolytic enzymes.
