BACKGROUND
sucrose transporters  play important roles in regulating the translocation of assimilates from source to sink tissues. identification and characterization of new suts in economically important crops such as wheat provide insights into their role in determining seed yield. to date, however, only one sut of wheat has been reported and functionally characterized. the present study reports the isolation and characterization of a new sut, designated as tasut <dig>  and its homeologues  in hexaploid wheat .


RESULTS
tasut2a and tasut2b genes each encode a protein with  <dig> amino acids, whereas tasut2d encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids. the molecular mass of these proteins is predicted to be ~  <dig> kda. topological analysis of the amino acid sequences of the three homeologues revealed that they contain  <dig> transmembrane spanning helices, which are described as distinct characteristic features of glycoside-pentoside-hexuronide cation symporter family that includes all known plant suts, and a histidine residue that appears to be localized at and associated conformationally with the sucrose binding site. yeast susy7/ura <dig> strain cells transformed with tasut2a, tasut2b and tasut2d were able to uptake sucrose and grow on a medium containing sucrose as a sole source of carbon; however, our subcellular localization study with plant cells revealed that tasut <dig> is localized to the tonoplast. the expression of tasut <dig> was detected in the source, including flag leaf blade, flag leaf sheath, peduncle, glumes, palea and lemma, and sink  tissues. the relative contributions of the three genomes of wheat to the total expression of tasut <dig> appear to differ with tissues and developmental stages. at the cellular level, tasut <dig> is expressed mainly in the vein of developing seeds and subepidermal mesophyll cells of the leaf blade.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that tasut <dig> is a new wheat sut protein. given that tasut <dig> is localized to the tonoplast and sucrose is temporarily stored in the vacuoles of both source and sink tissues, our data imply that tasut <dig> is involved in the intracellular partitioning of sucrose, particularly between the vacuole and cytoplasm.
