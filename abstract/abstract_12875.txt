BACKGROUND
plants respond to abiotic stress through complex regulation of transcription, including both transcriptional activation and repression. dehydration-responsive-element binding protein -type transcription factors are well known to play important roles in adaptation to abiotic stress. the mechanisms by which dreb-type transcription factors activate stress-induced gene expression have been relatively well studied. however, little is known about how dreb-type transcriptional repressors modulate plant stress responses. in this study, we report the functional analysis of rap <dig> , a dreb-type transcriptional repressor.


RESULTS
rap <dig>  possesses an apetala <dig>  domain that binds to dehydration-responsive elements  and an erf-associated amphiphilic repression  motif, as the repression domain located at the c-terminus of the protein. expression of rap <dig>  is strongly induced by drought and cold stress via an aba-independent pathway. arabidopsis plants overexpressing rap <dig>  show enhanced sensitivity to cold and drought stresses, while rap <dig> - <dig> and rap <dig> - <dig> t-dna insertion alleles result in reduced sensitivity to these stresses. the reduced stress sensitivity of the plant containing the rap <dig>  allele can be genetically complemented by the expression of rap <dig> , but not by the expression of ear-motif-mutated rap <dig> . furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation  analysis has identified responsive to desiccation/cold-regulated  genes as downstream targets of rap <dig>  in vivo. stress-induced expression of the rd/cor genes is repressed by overexpression of rap <dig>  and is increased in plants expressing the rap <dig>  allele. in addition, rap <dig>  can negatively regulate its own expression by binding to dres present in its own promoter. our data suggest that rap <dig>  acts as a negative transcriptional regulator in defence responses to cold and drought stress in arabidopsis.


CONCLUSIONS
a hypothetical model for the role of rap <dig>  in modulating plant responses to cold and drought is proposed in this study. it appears that rap <dig>  acts as a negative "subregulon" of dreb-type activators and is involved in the precise regulation of expression of stress-related genes, acting to keep stress responses under tight control.
