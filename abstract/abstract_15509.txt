BACKGROUND
the u <dig> small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle  component sf3b1/sap <dig> is the only spliceosomal protein known to be phosphorylated concomitant with splicing catalysis. dyrk1a is a nuclear protein kinase that has been localized to the splicing factor compartment. here we describe the identification of dyrk1a as a protein kinase that phosphorylates sf3b <dig> in vitro and in cultivated cells.


RESULTS
overexpression of dyrk1a caused a markedly increased phosphorylation of sf3b <dig> in cos- <dig> cells as assessed by western blotting with an antibody specific for phosphorylated thr-pro dipeptide motifs. phosphopeptide mapping of metabolically labelled sf3b <dig> showed that the majority of the in vivo-phosphopeptides corresponded to sites also phosphorylated by dyrk1a in vitro. phosphorylation with cyclin e/cdk <dig>  a kinase previously reported to phosphorylate sf3b <dig>  generated a completely different pattern of phosphopeptides. by mass spectrometry and mutational analysis of sf3b <dig>  thr <dig> was identified as the major phosphorylation site for dyrk1a. overexpression of dyrk1a or the related kinase, dyrk1b, resulted in an enhanced phosphorylation of thr <dig> in endogenous sf3b <dig> in cos- <dig> cells. downregulation of dyrk1a in hek <dig> cells or in hepg <dig> cells by rna interference reduced the phosphorylation of thr <dig> in sf3b <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the present data show that the splicing factor sf3b <dig> is a substrate of the protein kinase dyrk1a and suggest that dyrk1a may be involved in the regulation of pre mrna-splicing.
