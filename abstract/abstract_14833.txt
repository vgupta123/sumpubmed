BACKGROUND
hydroxyl radical that has the highest reactivity among reactive oxygen species  is generated through l-tyrosine-tyrosinase reaction. thus, the melanogenesis might induce oxidative stress in the skin. arbutin , a well-known tyrosinase inhibitor has been widely used for the purpose of skin whitening. the aim of the present study was to examine if arbutin could suppress the hydroxyl radical generation via tyrosinase reaction with its substrates, l-tyrosine and l-dopa.


RESULTS
the hydroxyl radical, which was determined by an electron spin resonance-spin trapping technique, was generated by the addition of not only l-tyrosine but l-dopa to tyrosinase in a concentration dependent manner. arbutin could inhibit the hydroxyl radical generation in the both reactions.


CONCLUSIONS
it is presumed that arbutin could alleviate oxidative stress derived from the melanogenic pathway in the skin in addition to its function as a whitening agent in cosmetics.
