BACKGROUND
cells have the ability to respond and adapt to environmental changes through activation of stress-activated protein kinases . although p <dig> sapk signalling is known to participate in the regulation of gene expression little is known on the molecular mechanisms used by this sapk to regulate stress-responsive genes and the overall set of genes regulated by p <dig> in response to different stimuli.


RESULTS
here, we report a whole genome expression analyses on mouse embryonic fibroblasts  treated with three different p <dig> sapk activating-stimuli, namely osmostress, the cytokine tnfα and the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. we have found that the activation kinetics of p38α sapk in response to these insults is different and also leads to a complex gene pattern response specific for a given stress with a restricted set of overlapping genes. in addition, we have analysed the contribution of p38α the major p <dig> family member present in mefs, to the overall stress-induced transcriptional response by using both a chemical inhibitor  and p38α deficient  mefs. we show here that p <dig> sapk dependency ranged between 60% and 88% depending on the treatments and that there is a very good overlap between the inhibitor treatment and the ko cells. furthermore, we have found that the dependency of sapk varies depending on the time the cells are subjected to osmostress.


CONCLUSIONS
our genome-wide transcriptional analyses shows a selective response to specific stimuli and a restricted common response of up to 20% of the stress up-regulated early genes that involves an important set of transcription factors, which might be critical for either cell adaptation or preparation for continuous extra-cellular changes. interestingly, up to 85% of the up-regulated genes are under the transcriptional control of p <dig> sapk. thus, activation of p <dig> sapk is critical to elicit the early gene expression program required for cell adaptation to stress.
