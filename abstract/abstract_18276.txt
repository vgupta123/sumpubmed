BACKGROUND
the spfh protein superfamily is a diverse family of proteins whose eukaryotic members are involved in the scaffolding of detergent-resistant microdomains. recently the origin of the spfh proteins has been questioned. instead, convergent evolution has been proposed. however, an independent, convergent evolution of three large prokaryotic and three eukaryotic families is highly unlikely, especially when other mechanisms such as lateral gene transfer which could also explain their distribution pattern have not yet been considered.

to gain better insight into this very diverse protein family, we have analyzed the genomes of  <dig> microorganisms and investigated the pattern of occurrence as well as the genomic vicinity of the prokaryotic spfh members.


RESULTS
according to sequence and operon structure, a clear division into  <dig> subfamilies was evident. three subfamilies  show a conserved operon structure and two additional subfamilies are linked to those three through functional aspects . therefore these subgroups most likely share common ancestry. the complex pattern of occurrence among the different phyla is indicative of lateral gene transfer. organisms that do not possess a single spfh protein are almost exclusively endosymbionts or endoparasites.


CONCLUSIONS
the conserved operon structure and functional similarities suggest that at least  <dig> subfamilies that encompass almost 75% of all prokaryotic spfh members share a common origin. their similarity to the different eukaryotic spfh families, as well as functional similarities, suggests that the eukaryotic spfh families originated from different prokaryotic spfh families rather than one. this explains the difficulties in obtaining a consistent phylogenetic tree of the eukaryotic spfh members. phylogenetic evidence points towards lateral gene transfer as one source of the very diverse patterns of occurrence in bacterial species.
