BACKGROUND
uracil-dna glycosylases are evolutionarily conserved dna repair enzymes. however, vaccinia virus uracil-dna glycosylase , also serves as an intrinsic and essential component of the processive dna polymerase complex during dna replication. in this complex d <dig> binds to a unique poxvirus specific protein a <dig> which tethers it to the dna polymerase. at the replication fork the dna scanning and repair function of d <dig> is coupled with dna replication. so far, dna-binding to d <dig> has not been structurally characterized.


RESULTS
this manuscript describes the first structure of a dna-complex of a uracil-dna glycosylase from the poxvirus family. this also represents the first structure of a uracil dna glycosylase in complex with an undamaged dna. in the asymmetric unit two d <dig> subunits bind simultaneously to complementary strands of the dna double helix. each d <dig> subunit interacts mainly with the central region of one strand. dna binds to the opposite side of the a20-binding surface on d <dig>  comparison of the present structure with the structure of uracil-containing dna-bound human uracil-dna glycosylase suggests that for dna binding and uracil removal d <dig> employs a unique set of residues and motifs that are highly conserved within the poxvirus family but different in other organisms.


CONCLUSIONS
the first structure of d <dig> bound to a truly non-specific undamaged double-stranded dna suggests that initial binding of dna may involve multiple non-specific interactions between the protein and the phosphate backbone.
