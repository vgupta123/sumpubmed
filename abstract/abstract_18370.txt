BACKGROUND
protein aggregation during monoclonal antibody  production can occur in upstream and downstream processing . current methods to determine aggregate formation during cell culture include size exclusion chromatography  with a previous affinity chromatography step in order to remove disturbing cell culture components. the pre-purification step itself can already influence protein aggregation and therefore does not necessarily reflect the real aggregate content present in cell culture. to analyze mab aggregate formation directly in the supernatant of chinese hamster ovary  cell culture, we established a protocol, which allows aggregate quantification using sec, without a falsifying pre-purification step.


RESULTS
the use of a 3 μm silica sec column or a sec column tailored for mab aggregate analysis allows the separation of mab monomer and aggregates from disturbing cell culture components, which enables aggregate determination directly in the supernatant. antibody aggregate analysis of a mab-producing cho dg <dig> cell line demonstrated the feasibility of the method. astonishingly, the supernatant of the cho cells consisted of over 75% mab dimer and larger oligomers, representing a substantially higher aggregate content than reported in literature so far.


CONCLUSIONS
this study highlights that aggregate quantification directly in the cell culture supernatant using appropriate sec columns with suitable mab aggregate standards is feasible without falsification by previous affinity chromatography. moreover, our results indicate that aggregate formation should be addressed directly in the cell culture and is not only a problem in dsp.
