BACKGROUND
ryegrasses and fescues  are species of forage and turf grasses which are used widely in agricultural and amenity situations. they are classified within the sub-family pooideae and so are closely related to brachypodium distachyon, wheat, barley, rye and oats. recently, a dart array has been developed which can be used in generating marker and mapping information for ryegrasses and fescues. this represents a potential common marker set for ryegrass and fescue researchers which can be linked through to comparative genomic information for the grasses.


RESULTS
a f <dig> perennial ryegrass genetic map was developed consisting of  <dig> linkage groups defined by  <dig> markers and deriving a total map length of 683Â cm. the marker set included  <dig> dart and  <dig> gene sequence-based markers. comparison with previous dart mapping studies in perennial and italian ryegrass  identified  <dig> and  <dig> dart markers in common, respectively, of which 94% and 87% mapped to homoeologous linkage groups. a similar comparison with meadow fescue  identified only  <dig> dart markers in common, of which c. 50% mapped to non-homoelogous linkage groups. in l. perenne, the genetic distance spanned by the dart markers encompassed the majority of the regions that could be described in terms of comparative genomic relationships with rice, brachypodium distachyon, and sorghum bicolor.


CONCLUSIONS
dart markers are likely to be a useful common marker resource for ryegrasses and fescues, though the success in aligning different populations through the mapping of common markers will be influenced by degrees of population interrelatedness. the detailed mapping of dart and gene-based markers in this study potentially allows comparative relationships to be derived in future mapping populations characterised using solely dart markers.
