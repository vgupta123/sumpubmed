BACKGROUND
the effect of age on the bone mineral density and microarchitecture of the equine radius and tibia was investigated. fifty-six bones from  <dig> horses aged four to  <dig> years were used. there were nine geldings and six mares, and none of the horses had any disease influencing bone properties. xtreme computed tomography was used to evaluate a 9-mm segment of the diaphysis and metaphysis of each bone. the following variables were determined: length of the bone, circumference and diameter in the frontal and sagittal planes in the middle of the bone.

diaphysis: total volume, bone volume, bone volume ratio, slice area, bone area, marrow area, cortical and marrow thickness, bone mineral density, polar moment of inertia of the cortex.

metaphysis: total area, bone area, cortical bone area, cortical thickness, bone mineral density, bone mineral density in the cortex, bone mineral density in the trabecular region, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, trabecular separation, polar moment of inertia of the metaphysis, polar moment of inertia of the cortex of the metaphysis.


RESULTS
bone density and microarchitecture were not affected by breed or gender. however, the microarchitecture varied with the age of the horse; the number of trabeculae decreased significantly and the distance between trabeculae increased significantly with increasing age. there were no significant differences between bones of the left and right limbs or between the radius and tibia.


CONCLUSIONS
the variables investigated did not differ between geldings and mares. however, there were age-related changes in the microstructure of the bones. further experimental studies are necessary to determine whether these changes reduce bone strength. age-related changes in the bones were seen and may explain the higher incidence of fractures and fissures in older horses.
