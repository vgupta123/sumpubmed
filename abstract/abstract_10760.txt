BACKGROUND
in arabidopsis thaliana, the family of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels  is composed of  <dig> members. previous studies indicate that plant cngcs are involved in the control of growth processes and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. according to their proposed function as cation entry pathways these channels contribute to cellular cation homeostasis, including calcium and sodium, as well as to stress-related signal transduction. here, we studied the expression patterns and regulation of cngc <dig> and cngc <dig>  which constitute one of the five cngc subfamilies.


RESULTS
gus, gfp and luciferase reporter assays were used to study the expression of cngc <dig> and cngc <dig> genes from arabidopsis thaliana in response to developmental cues and salt stress. cngc <dig> and cngc <dig> were differentially expressed in roots and shoots. the cngc <dig> gene was predominantly active in roots already at early growth stages. major expression was observed in the phloem. cngc <dig> showed highest promoter activity in mesophyll cells surrounding the veins. its expression increased during development and was maximal in mature and senescent leaves. both genes were upregulated in the shoot in response to elevated nacl but not mannitol concentrations. while in the root, cngc <dig> did not respond to changes in the salt concentration, in the shoot it was strongly upregulated in the observed time frame . salt-induction of cngc <dig> was also observed in the shoot, starting already one hour after stress treatment. it occurred with similar kinetics, irrespective of whether nacl was applied to roots of intact plants or to the petiole of detached leaves. no differences in k and na contents of the shoots were measured in homozygous t-dna insertion lines for cngc <dig> and cngc <dig>  respectively, which developed a growth phenotype in the presence of up to  <dig> mm nacl similar to that of the wild type.


CONCLUSIONS
together, the results strongly suggest that both channels are involved in the salinity response of different cell types in the shoot. upon salinity both genes are upregulated within hours. cngc <dig> and cngc <dig> could assist the plant to cope with toxic effects caused by salt stress, probably by contributing to a re-allocation of sodium within the plant.
