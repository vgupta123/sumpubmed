BACKGROUND
the equine periodontium provides tooth support and lifelong tooth eruption on a remarkable scale. these functions require continuous tissue remodeling. it is assumed that multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells  reside in the periodontal ligament  and play a crucial role in regulating physiological periodontal tissue regeneration. the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize equine periodontal msc.

tissue samples were obtained from four healthy horses. primary cell populations were har-vested and cultured from the gingiva, from three horizontal levels of the pdl  and for comparison purposes from the subcutis . colony-forming cells were grown on uncoated culture dishes and typical in vitro characteristics of non-human msc, i.e. self-renewal capacity, population doubling time, expression of stemness markers and trilineage differentiation were analyzed.


RESULTS
colony-forming cell populations from all locations showed expression of the stemness markers cd <dig> and cd <dig>  in vitro self-renewal capacity was demonstrated by colony-forming unit fibroblast  assays. cfu-efficiency was highest in cell populations from the apical and from the mid-tooth pdl. population doubling time was highest in subcutaneous cells. all investigated cell populations possessed trilineage differentiation potential into osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages.


CONCLUSIONS
due to the demonstrated in vitro characteristics cells were referred to as equine subcutaneous msc , equine gingival msc  and equine periodontal msc . according to different pdl levels, ep-msc were further specified as ep-msc from the apical pdl , ep-msc from the mid-tooth pdl  and ep-msc from the subgingival pdl . considering current concepts of cell-based regenerative therapies in horses, ep-msc might be promising candidates for future clinical applications in equine orthopedic and periodontal diseases.
