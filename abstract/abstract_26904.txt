BACKGROUND
penicillium chrysogenum has been used in producing penicillin and derived β-lactam antibiotics for many years. although the genome of the mutant strain p. chrysogenum wisconsin 54- <dig> has already been sequenced, the versatility and genetic diversity of this species still needs to be intensively studied. in this study, the genome of the wild-type p. chrysogenum strain kf- <dig>  which has high activity against ustilaginoidea virens, was sequenced and characterized.


RESULTS
the genome of kf- <dig> was about  <dig>  mb in size and contained  <dig>  putative open reading frames . thirteen genes were predicted to encode two-component system proteins, of which six were putatively involved in osmolarity adaption. there were  <dig> putative secondary metabolism pathways and numerous genes that were essential in metabolite biosynthesis. several p. chrysogenum virus untranslated region sequences were found in the kf- <dig> genome, suggesting that there might be a relationship between the virus and p. chrysogenum in evolution. comparative genome analysis showed that the genomes of kf- <dig> and wisconsin 54- <dig> were highly similar, except that kf- <dig> was  <dig>  mb smaller. three hundred and fifty-five kf- <dig> specific genes were found and the biological functions of the proteins encoded by these genes were mainly unknown , except for some orfs encoding proteins with predicted functions in transport, metabolism, and signal transduction. numerous kf-25-specific genes were found to be associated with the pathogenicity and virulence of the strains, which were identical to those of wild-type p. chrysogenum nrrl  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
genome sequencing and comparative analysis are helpful in further understanding the biology, evolution, and environment adaption of p. chrysogenum, and provide a new tool for identifying further functional metabolites.
