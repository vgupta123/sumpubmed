BACKGROUND
small rna  play pivotal roles in reproductive development, and their biogenesis and action mechanisms are well characterised in angiosperm plants; however, corresponding studies in conifers are very limited. to improve our understanding of the roles of srna pathways in the reproductive development of conifers, the genes associated with srna biogenesis and action pathways were identified and analysed, and srna sequencing and parallel analysis of rna ends  were performed in male and female cones of the chinese pine .


RESULTS
based on high-quality reference transcriptomic sequences,  <dig> high-confidence homologues involved in srna biogenesis and action in p. tabuliformis were identified, including two different dcl <dig> genes and one ago <dig> gene. more than 75 % of genes involved in srna biogenesis and action have higher expression levels in female than in male cones. twenty-six microrna  families and  <dig> targets, including  <dig> 24-nt srnas with a 5’ a, which are specifically expressed in male cones or female cones and probably bind to ago <dig>  were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
the srna pathways have higher activity in female than in male cones, and the mirna pathways are the main srna pathways in p. tabuliformis. the low level of 24-nt short-interfering rnas in conifers is not caused by the absence of biogenesis-related genes or ago-binding proteins, but most likely caused by the low accumulation of these key components. the identification of srnas and their targets, as well as genes associated with srna biogenesis and action, will provide a good starting point for investigations into the roles of srna pathways in cone development in conifers.
