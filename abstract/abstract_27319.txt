BACKGROUND
d-3-aminoisobutyrate, an intermediary product of thymine, is converted to 2-methyl-3-oxopropanoate using pyruvate as an amino acceptor by d-3-aminoisobutyrate-pyruvate aminotransferase . a large amount of d-aib at is distributed in the kidney and liver; however, small amounts are found in the brain. recently, d-aib at was reported to metabolize asymmetric dimethylarginine  in vivo and was suggested to be an important enzyme for nitric oxide metabolism because adma is a competitive inhibitor for nitric oxide synthase. in this study, we examined the distribution of d-aib at in the rat brain further to understand its role. we measured d-aib at mrna and protein expression using quantitative rt-pcr and western blotting, and monitored its distribution using immunohistochemical staining.


RESULTS
d-aib at was distributed throughout the brain, with high expression in the cortex and hippocampus. immunohistochemical staining revealed that d-aib at was highly expressed in the retrosplenial cortex and in hippocampal neurons.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that d-aib at is distributed in the examined- just the regions and may play an important role there.
