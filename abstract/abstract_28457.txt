BACKGROUND
evolutionary analysis provides a formal framework for comparative analysis of genomic and other data. in evolutionary analysis, observed data are treated as the terminal states of characters that have evolved  along the branches of a tree. the nexus standard of maddison, et al.  provides a portable, expressive and flexible text format for representing character-state data and trees. however, due to its complexity, nexus is not well supported by software and is not easily accessible to bioinformatics users and developers.


RESULTS
bio::nexus is an application programming interface  implemented in perl, available from cpan and sourceforge. the  <dig> bio::nexus modules define  <dig> methods in  <dig> lines of code, with  <dig> lines of pod . bio::nexus provides an object-oriented interface to reading, writing and manipulating the contents of nexus files. it closely follows the extensive explanation of the nexus format provided by maddison et al., supplemented with a few extensions such as support for the nhx  tree format.


CONCLUSIONS
in spite of some limitations owing to the complexity of nexus files and the lack of a formal grammar, nexus will continue to be useful for years to come. bio::nexus provides a user-friendly api for nexus supplemented with an extensive set of methods for manipulations such as re-rooting trees and selecting subsets of data. bio::nexus can be used as glue code for connecting existing software that uses nexus, or as a framework for new applications.
