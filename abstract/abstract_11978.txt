BACKGROUND
the present study compared the neural correlates of an intramodally and a crossmodally acquired second language . deaf people who had learned their l <dig>  german sign language , and their l <dig>  german, through the visual modality were compared with hearing l <dig> learners of german and german native speakers. correct and incorrect german sentences were presented word by word on a computer screen while the electroencephalogram was recorded. at the end of each sentence, the participants judged whether or not the sentence was correct. two types of violations were realized: either a semantically implausible noun or a violation of subject-verb number agreement was embedded at a sentence medial position.


RESULTS
semantic errors elicited an n <dig>  followed by a late positivity in all groups. in native speakers of german, verb-agreement violations were followed by a left lateralized negativity, which has been associated with an automatic parsing process. we observed a syntax related negativity in both high performing hearing and deaf l <dig> learners as well. finally, this negativity was followed by a posteriorly distributed positivity in all three groups.


CONCLUSIONS
although deaf learners have learned german as an l <dig> mainly via the visual modality they seem to engage comparable processing mechanisms as hearing l <dig> learners. thus, the data underscore the modality transcendence of language.
