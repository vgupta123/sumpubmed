BACKGROUND
embryonic morphogenesis of vascular and muscular systems is tightly coordinated, and a functional cooperation of mtmr <dig> with pi3k in actin filament modeling and muscle development has been revealed in zebrafish. here, we attempt to explore the function of mtmr <dig> in vasculature development parallel to its function in muscle development.


RESULTS
during early stage of somitogenesis, mtmr <dig> expression was detected in both somitic mesodem and ventral mesoderm. knockdown of mtmr <dig> by morpholino impairs arterial endothelial marker expression, and results in endothelial cell reduction and vasculogenesis defects, such as retardation in intersegmental vessel development and interruption of trunk dorsal aorta. moreover, mtmr <dig> morphants show loss of arterial endothelial cell identity in dorsal aorta, which is effectively rescued by low concentration of pi3k inhibitor, and by over-expression of dnpka mrna or vegf mrna. interestingly, mtmr <dig> expression is up-regulated when zebrafish embryos are treated with specific inhibitor of hedgehog pathway that abolishes arterial marker expression.


CONCLUSIONS
these data indicate that mtmr <dig> is essential for vasculature development in zebrafish embryos, and may play a role in arterial specification through repressing pi3k activity. it is suggested that mtmr <dig> should represent a novel element of the hedgehog/pi3k/vegf signaling cascade that controls arterial specification.
