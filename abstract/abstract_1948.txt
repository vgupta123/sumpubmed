BACKGROUND
the rlnn <dig> locus, which resides on chromosome 7a of bread wheat  confers moderate resistance against the root lesion nematode pratylenchus neglectus. prior to this research, the exact linkage relationships of rlnn <dig> with other loci on chromosome 7a were not clear and there were no simple codominant markers available for selection of rlnn <dig> in wheat breeding. the objectives of the research reported here were to  develop an improved genetic map of the rlnn <dig> region of chromosome 7a and  develop molecular markers that could be used in marker-assisted selection to improve resistance of wheat against p. neglectus.


RESULTS
a large-effect quantitative trait locus  for resistance against p. neglectus was genetically mapped using a population of excalibur/kukri doubled haploid lines. this qtl coincides in position with the rust resistance gene lr20/sr <dig>  the phytoene synthase gene psy-a <dig> and  <dig> molecular markers, including five new markers designed using wheat-rice comparative genomics and wheat expressed sequence tags. two of the new markers are suitable for use as molecular diagnostic tools to distinguish plants that carry rlnn <dig> and lr20/sr <dig> from those that do not carry these resistance genes.


CONCLUSIONS
the genomic location of rlnn <dig> was confirmed to be in the terminal region of the long arm of chromosome 7a. molecular markers were developed that provide simple alternatives to costly phenotypic assessment of resistance against p. neglectus in wheat breeding. in excalibur, genetic recombination seems to be completely suppressed in the rlnn <dig> region.
