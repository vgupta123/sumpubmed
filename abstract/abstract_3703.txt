BACKGROUND
gab <dig> is a docking protein that recruits phosphatidylinositol- <dig> kinase  and other effector proteins in response to the activation of many receptor tyrosine kinases . as the autophosphorylation sites on egf-receptor  do not include canonical pi- <dig> kinase binding sites, it is thought that egf stimulation of pi- <dig> kinase and its downstream effector akt is mediated by an indirect mechanism.


RESULTS
we used fibroblasts isolated from gab1-/- mouse embryos to explore the mechanism of egf stimulation of the pi- <dig> kinase/akt anti-apoptotic cell signaling pathway. we demonstrate that gab <dig> is essential for egf stimulation of pi- <dig> kinase and akt in these cells and that these responses are mediated by complex formation between p <dig>  the regulatory subunit of pi- <dig> kinase, and three canonical tyrosine phosphorylation sites on gab <dig>  furthermore, complex formation between gab <dig> and the protein tyrosine phosphatase shp <dig> negatively regulates gab <dig> mediated pi- <dig> kinase and akt activation following egf-receptor stimulation. we also demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of erbb <dig> may lead to recruitment and activation of pi- <dig> kinase and akt in gab1-/- mefs.


CONCLUSIONS
the primary mechanism of egf-induced stimulation of the pi- <dig> kinase/akt anti-apoptotic pathway occurs via the docking protein gab <dig>  however, in cells expressing erbb <dig>  egf and neuroregulin can stimulate pi- <dig> kinase and akt activation in a gab1-dependent or gab1-independent manner.
