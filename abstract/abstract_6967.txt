BACKGROUND
fumonisins are economically important mycotoxins which until recently were considered to originate from only a few fusarium species. however recently a putative fumonisin gene cluster was discovered in two different aspergillus niger strains followed by detection of an actual fumonisin b <dig>  production in four strains of this biotechnologically important workhorse.


RESULTS
in the present study, a screening of  <dig> a. niger strains and  <dig> assumed fumonisin producing fusarium strains from  <dig> species, showed that all  <dig> a. niger strains produced fb <dig> and  <dig> of  <dig> fusarium produced fumonisin b <dig> and other isoforms . five a. niger and five fusarium spp. were incubated at six different temperatures from 15-42°c on czapek yeast agar +5% salt or potato dextrose agar. a. niger had the highest production of fb <dig> at 25-30°c whereas fusarium spp. had the maximal production of fb <dig> and fb <dig> at 20-25°c. addition of  <dig> -5% nacl, or 10-20% sucrose increased the fb <dig> production of a. niger, whereas addition of glycerol reduced fb <dig> production. all three water activity lowering solutes reduced the fumonisin production of the fusarium species.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study shows that the regulation of fumonisin production is very different in a. niger and fusarium, and that food and feeds preserved by addition of sugar or salts may be good substrates for fumonisin b <dig> production by a. niger.
