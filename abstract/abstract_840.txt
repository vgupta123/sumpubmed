BACKGROUND
coronaviruses are the diverse group of rna virus. from  <dig>  six strains of human coronaviruses have emerged that includes sars-cov and the recent infection by deadly mers-cov which is now going to cause another outbreak. prevention of these viruses is urgent and a universal vaccine for all strain could be a promising solution in this circumstance. in this study we aimed to design an epitope based vaccine against all strain of human coronavirus.


RESULTS
multiple sequence alignment  approach was employed among spike , membrane , enveloped  and nucleocapsid  protein and replicase polyprotein 1ab to identify which one is highly conserve in all coronaviruses strains. next, we use various in silico tools to predict consensus immunogenic and conserved peptide. we found that conserved region is present only in the rna directed rna polymerase protein. in this protein we identified one epitope wdypkcdra is highly immunogenic and 100% conserved among all available human coronavirus strains.


CONCLUSIONS
here we suggest in vivo study of our identified novel peptide antigen in rna directed rna polymerase protein for universal vaccine â€“ which may be the way to prevent all human coronavirus disease.
