BACKGROUND
the pituitary gland is a highly vascularized tissue that requires coordinated interactions between the neural ectoderm, oral ectoderm, and head mesenchyme during development for proper physiological function. the interactions between the neural ectoderm and oral ectoderm, especially the role of the pituitary organizer in shaping the pituitary precursor, rathke’s pouch, are well described. however, less is known about the role of head mesenchyme in pituitary organogenesis. the head mesenchyme is derived from definitive mesoderm and neural crest, but the relative contributions of these tissues to the mesenchyme adjacent to the pituitary are not known.


RESULTS
we carried out lineage tracing experiments using two neural crest-specific mouse cre lines, wnt1-cre and p0-cre, and determined that the head mesenchyme rostral to the pituitary gland is neural crest derived. to assess the role of the neural crest in pituitary development we ablated it, using wnt1-cre to delete ctnnb <dig> , which is required for neural crest development. the wnt1-cre is active in the neural ectoderm, principally in the mesencephalon, but also in the posterior diencephalon. loss of β-catenin in this domain causes a rostral shift in the ventral diencephalon, including the pituitary organizer, resulting in pituitary dysmorphology. the neural crest deficient embryos have abnormally dilated pituitary vasculature due to a loss of neural crest derived pericytes.


CONCLUSIONS
β-catenin in the wnt <dig> expression domain, including the neural crest, plays a critical role in regulation of pituitary gland growth, development, and vascularization.
