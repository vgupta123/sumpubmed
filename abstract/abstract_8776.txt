BACKGROUND
the value of a continuous character evolving on a phylogenetic tree is commonly modelled as the location of a particle moving under one-dimensional brownian motion with constant rate. the brownian motion model is best suited to characters evolving under neutral drift or tracking an optimum that drifts neutrally. we present a generalization of the brownian motion model which relaxes assumptions of neutrality and gradualism by considering increments to evolving characters to be drawn from a heavy-tailed stable distribution .


RESULTS
we describe markov chain monte carlo methods for fitting the model to biological data paying special attention to ancestral state reconstruction, and study the performance of the model in comparison with a selection of existing comparative methods, using both simulated data and a database of body mass in  <dig>  mammalian species. we discuss hypothesis testing and model selection. the stable model outperforms brownian and ornstein-uhlenbeck approaches under simulations in which traits evolve with occasional large “jumps” in their value, but does not perform markedly worse for traits evolving under a truly brownian process.


CONCLUSIONS
the stable model is well suited to a stochastic process with a volatile rate of change in which biological characters undergo a mixture of neutral drift and occasional evolutionary events of large magnitude.
