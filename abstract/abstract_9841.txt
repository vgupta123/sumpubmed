BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis has emerged as a significant foodborne pathogen throughout the world and is commonly characterized by phage typing. in canada phage types   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> predominate and in  <dig> a large foodborne pt <dig> outbreak occurred in the province of ontario. the ability to link strains during this outbreak was difficult due to the apparent clonality of pt <dig> isolates in canada, as there was a single dominant pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  profile amongst epidemiologically linked human and food isolates as well as concurrent sporadic strains. the aim of this study was to perform comparative genomic hybridization , dna sequence-based typing  genomic analyses, plasmid analyses, and automated repetitive sequence-based pcr  to identify epidemiologically significant traits capable of subtyping s. enteritidis pt <dig> 


RESULTS
cgh using an oligonucleotide array based upon chromosomal coding sequences of s. enterica serovar typhimurium strain lt <dig> and the salmonella genomic island  <dig> successfully determined major genetic differences between s. typhimurium and s. enteritidis pt <dig>  but no significant strain-to-strain differences were observed between s. enteritidis pt <dig> isolates. individual loci  that were identified as potentially divergent in the cgh data set were sequenced in a panel of s. enteritidis strains, and no differences were detected between the pt <dig> strains. additional sequence-based typing was performed at the fima, mdh, manb, cyaa, citt, caic, dmsa, rata and stm <dig> loci. similarly, no diversity was observed amongst pt <dig> strains. variation in plasmid content between pt <dig> strains was observed, but macrorestriction with bglii did not identify further differences. automated rep-pcr patterns were variable between serovars, but s. enteritidis pt <dig> strains could not be differentiated.


CONCLUSIONS
none of the methods identified any significant variation between pt <dig> strains. greater than  <dig>  base pairs of sequence for each of seven s. enteritidis pt <dig> strains were analyzed without detecting a single polymorphic site, although diversity between different phage types of s. enteritidis was observed. these data suggest that canadian s. enteritidis pt <dig> strains are highly related genetically.
