BACKGROUND
archaea evoke interest among researchers for two enigmatic characteristics â€“a combination of bacterial and eukaryotic components in their molecular architectures and an enormous diversity in their life-style and metabolic capabilities. despite considerable research efforts, lineage- specific/niche-specific molecular features of the whole archaeal world are yet to be fully unveiled. the study offers the first large-scale in silico proteome analysis of all archaeal species of known genome sequences with a special emphasis on methanogenic and sulphur-metabolising archaea.


RESULTS
overall amino acid usage in archaea is dominated by gc-bias. but the environmental factors like oxygen requirement or thermal adaptation seem to play important roles in selection of residues with no gc-bias at the codon level. all methanogens, irrespective of their thermal/salt adaptation, show higher usage of cys and have relatively acidic proteomes, while the proteomes of sulphur-metabolisers have higher aromaticity and more positive charges. despite of exhibiting thermophilic life-style, korarchaeota possesses an acidic proteome. among the distinct trends prevailing in cogs  distribution profiles, crenarchaeal organisms display higher intra-order variations in cogs repertoire, especially in the metabolic ones, as compared to euryarchaea. all methanogens are characterised by a presence of  <dig> exclusive cogs.


CONCLUSIONS
divergences in amino acid usage, aromaticity/charge profiles and cog repertoire among methanogens and sulphur-metabolisers, aerobic and anaerobic archaea or korarchaeota and nanoarchaeota, as elucidated in the present study, point towards the presence of distinct molecular strategies for niche specialization in the archaeal world.
