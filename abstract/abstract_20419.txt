BACKGROUND
in tanzania, little is known on the species distribution and antifungal susceptibility profiles of yeast isolates from hiv-infected patients with primary and recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis.

methods
a total of  <dig> clinical oral yeasts were isolated from  <dig> hiv-infected patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis at the muhimbili national hospital, dar es salaam, tanzania. identification of the yeasts was performed using standard phenotypic methods. antifungal susceptibility to fluconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, clotrimazole, amphotericin b and nystatin was assessed using a broth microdilution format according to the guidelines of the clinical and laboratory standard institute .


RESULTS
candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species from  <dig>  patients followed by c. glabrata from  <dig>  patients, and c. krusei from  <dig>  patients. there was no observed significant difference in species distribution between patients with primary and recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis, but isolates cultured from patients previously treated were significantly less susceptible to the azole compounds compared to those cultured from antifungal na√Øve patients.


CONCLUSIONS
c. albicans was the most frequently isolated species from patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis. oral yeast isolates from tanzania had high level susceptibility to the antifungal agents tested. recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis and previous antifungal therapy significantly correlated with reduced susceptibility to azoles antifungal agents.
