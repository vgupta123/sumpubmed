BACKGROUND
dna methyltransferase  <dig>  has been shown to be phosphorylated on multiple serine and threonine residues, based on cell type and physiological conditions. although recent studies have suggested that protein kinase c  may be involved, the individual contribution of pkc isoforms in their ability to phosphorylate dnmt <dig> remains unknown. the pkc family consists of at least  <dig> isoforms that possess distinct differences in structure, substrate requirement, expression and localization.


RESULTS
here we show that pkcα, βi, βii, δ, γ, η, ζ and μ preferentially phosphorylate the n-terminal domain of human dnmt <dig>  no such phosphorylation of dnmt <dig> was observed with pkcε. using pkcζ as a prototype model, we also found that pkc physically interacts with and phosphorylates dnmt <dig>  in vitro phosphorylation assays conducted with recombinant fragments of dnmt <dig> showed that pkcζ preferentially phosphorylated the n-terminal region of dnmt <dig>  the interaction of pkcζ with dnmt <dig> was confirmed by gst pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. co-localization experiments by fluorescent microscopy further showed that endogenous pkcζ and dnmt <dig> were present in the same molecular complex. endogenous pkcζ activity was also detected when dnmt <dig> was immunoprecipitated from hek- <dig> cells. overexpression of both pkcζ and dnmt <dig> in hek- <dig> cells, but not of either alone, reduced the methylation status of genes distributed across the genome. moreover, in vitro phosphorylation of dnmt <dig> by pkcζ reduced its methytransferase activity.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that phosphorylation of human dnmt <dig> by pkc is isoform-specific and provides the first evidence of cooperation between pkcζ and dnmt <dig> in the control of the dna methylation patterns of the genome.
