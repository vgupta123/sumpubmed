BACKGROUND
lipopeptides  are structurally diverse compounds with potent surfactant and broad-spectrum antibiotic activities. in pseudomonas and other bacterial genera, lp biosynthesis is governed by large multimodular nonribosomal peptide synthetases . to date, relatively little is known about the regulatory genetic network of lp biosynthesis.


RESULTS
this study provides evidence that the chaperone clpa, together with the serine protease clpp, regulates the biosynthesis of the lp massetolide in pseudomonas fluorescens ss <dig>  whole-genome transcriptome analyses of clpa and clpp mutants showed their involvement in the transcription of the nrps genes massabc and the transcriptional regulator massar. in addition, transcription of genes associated with cell wall and membrane biogenesis, energy production and conversion, amino acid transport and metabolism, and pilus assembly were altered by mutations in clpa and clpp. proteome analysis allowed the identification of additional cellular changes associated to clpa and clpp mutations. the expression of proteins of the citrate cycle and the heat shock proteins dnak and dnaj were particularly affected. combined with previous findings, these results suggest that the clpap complex regulates massetolide biosynthesis via the pathway-specific, luxr-type regulator massar, the heat shock proteins dnak and dnaj, and proteins of the tca cycle.


CONCLUSIONS
combining transcriptome and proteome analyses provided new insights into the regulation of lp biosynthesis in p. fluorescens and led to the identification of specific missing links in the regulatory pathways.
