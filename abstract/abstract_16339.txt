BACKGROUND
the european  genotype of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  has recently emerged in china. the coexistence of genotype-i and -ii prrsv strains could cause seriously affect prrsv diagnosis and management. current vaccines are not able to protect against prrsv infection completely and have inherent drawbacks. thus, genetically engineered vaccines, including dna vaccine and live vector engineered vaccines, have been developed. this study aimed to determine the enhanced immune responses of mice inoculated with a dna vaccine coexpressing gp <dig> and gp <dig> of a genotype-i prrsv.


RESULTS
to evaluate the immunogenicity of gp <dig> and gp <dig> proteins from european-type prrsv, three dna vaccines, pvax1-eu-orf3-orf <dig>  pvax1-eu-orf <dig> and pvax1-eu-orf <dig>  were constructed, which were based on a genotype-i lv strain . balb/c mice were immunized with the dna vaccines; delivered in the form of chitosan-dna nanoparticles. to increase the efficiency of the vaccine, quil a  was used as an adjuvant. gp <dig> and gp5-specific antibodies, neutralizing antibodies and cytokines  from the immunized mice sera, and other immune parameters, were examined, including t-cell proliferation responses and subgroups of spleen t-lymphocytes. the results showed that orf <dig> and orf <dig> proteins of genotype-i prrsv induced gp <dig> and gp5-specific antibodies that could neutralize the virus. the levels of cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and ifn–γ of the experimental groups were significantly higher than those of control groups after booster vaccination . the production of cd3+cd4+ and cd3+cd8+ t lymphocyte was also induced. t lymphocyte proliferation assays showed that the prrsv lv strain virus could stimulate the proliferation of t lymphocytes in mice in the experimental group.


CONCLUSIONS
using quil a as adjuvant, genotype-i prrsv gp <dig> and gp <dig> proteins produced good immunogenicity and reactivity. more importantly, better prrsv-specific neutralizing antibody titers and cell-mediated immune responses were observed in mice immunized with the dna vaccine co-expressing gp <dig> and gp <dig> proteins than in mice immunized with a dna vaccine expressing either protein singly. the results of this study demonstrated that co-immunization with gp <dig> and gp <dig> produced a better immune response in mice.
