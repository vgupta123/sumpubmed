BACKGROUND
the ubiquitin protein is present in all eukaryotic cells and promoters from ubiquitin genes are good candidates to regulate the constitutive expression of transgenes in plants. therefore, two switchgrass  ubiquitin genes  were cloned and characterized. reporter constructs were produced containing the isolated 5' upstream regulatory regions of the coding sequences  fused to the uida coding region  and tested for transient and stable expression in a variety of plant species and tissues.


RESULTS
pvubi <dig> consists of  <dig> bp containing cis-acting regulatory elements, a 5' untranslated region  containing a  <dig> bp non-coding exon and a  <dig> bp intron, and a  <dig> bp open reading frame  that encodes four tandem, head -to-tail ubiquitin monomer repeats followed by a  <dig> bp 3' utr. pvubi <dig> consists of  <dig> bp containing cis-acting regulatory elements, a 5' utr containing a  <dig> bp non-coding exon and a  <dig> bp intron, a  <dig> bp orf that encodes five tandem ubiquitin monomer repeats and a  <dig> bp 3' utr. pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> were expressed in all examined switchgrass tissues as measured by qrt-pcr. using biolistic bombardment, pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoters showed strong expression in switchgrass and rice callus, equaling or surpassing the expression levels of the camv 35s, 2x35s, zmubi <dig>  and osact <dig> promoters. gus staining following stable transformation in rice demonstrated that the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoters drove expression in all examined tissues. when stably transformed into tobacco , the pvubi2+ <dig> and pvubi2+ <dig> promoter fusion variants showed expression in vascular and reproductive tissues.


CONCLUSIONS
the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoters drive expression in switchgrass, rice and tobacco and are strong constitutive promoter candidates that will be useful in genetic transformation of monocots and dicots.
