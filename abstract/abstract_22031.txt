BACKGROUND
fatty acids  play a critical role in energy homeostasis and metabolic diseases; in the context of livestock species, their profile also impacts on meat quality for healthy human consumption. molecular pathways controlling lipid metabolism are highly interconnected and are not fully understood. elucidating these molecular processes will aid technological development towards improvement of pork meat quality and increased knowledge of fa metabolism, underpinning metabolic diseases in humans.


RESULTS
the results from genome-wide association studies  across  <dig> phenotypes were subjected to an association weight matrix  approach to predict a network of  <dig>  genes related to intramuscular fa composition in pigs. to identify the key regulators of fa metabolism, we focused on the minimal set of transcription factors  that the explored the majority of the network topology. pathway and network analyses pointed towards a trio of tf as key regulators of fa metabolism: ncoa <dig>  fhl <dig> and ep <dig>  promoter sequence analyses confirmed that these tf have binding sites for some well-know regulators of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. for the first time in a non-model species, some of the co-associations observed at the genetic level were validated through co-expression at the transcriptomic level based on real-time pcr of  <dig> genes in adipose tissue, and a further  <dig> genes in liver. in particular, liver expression of ncoa <dig> and ep <dig> differed between pig breeds  extreme in terms of fat deposition. highly clustered co-expression networks in both liver and adipose tissues were observed. ep <dig> and ncoa <dig> showed centrality parameters above average in the both networks. over all genes, co-expression analyses confirmed  <dig> % of the awm predicted gene-gene interactions in liver and  <dig> % in adipose tissue. the magnitude of this validation varied across genes, with up to  <dig> % of the connections of ncoa <dig> in adipose tissue being validated via co-expression.


CONCLUSIONS
our results recapitulate the known transcriptional regulation of fa metabolism, predict gene interactions that can be experimentally validated, and suggest that genetic variants mapped to ep <dig>  fhl <dig>  and ncoa <dig> modulate lipid metabolism and control energy homeostasis in pigs.
