BACKGROUND
the distribution of chromatin-associated proteins plays a key role in directing nuclear function. previously, we developed an image-based method to quantify the nuclear distributions of proteins and showed that these distributions depended on the phenotype of human mammary epithelial cells. here we describe a method that creates a hierarchical tree of the given cell phenotypes and calculates the statistical significance between them, based on the clustering analysis of nuclear protein distributions.


RESULTS
nuclear distributions of nuclear mitotic apparatus protein were previously obtained for non-neoplastic s <dig> and malignant t4- <dig> human mammary epithelial cells cultured for up to  <dig> days. cell phenotype was defined as s <dig> or t4- <dig> and the number of days in cultured. a probabilistic ensemble approach was used to define a set of consensus clusters from the results of multiple traditional cluster analysis techniques applied to the nuclear distribution data. cluster histograms were constructed to show how cells in any one phenotype were distributed across the consensus clusters. grouping various phenotypes allowed us to build phenotype trees and calculate the statistical difference between each group. the results showed that non-neoplastic s <dig> cells could be distinguished from malignant t4- <dig> cells with  <dig> % accuracy; that proliferating s <dig> cells could be distinguished from differentiated s <dig> cells with  <dig> % accuracy; and showed no significant difference between the various phenotypes of t4- <dig> cells corresponding to increasing tumor sizes.


CONCLUSIONS
this work presents a cluster analysis method that can identify significant cell phenotypes, based on the nuclear distribution of specific proteins, with high accuracy.
