BACKGROUND
β-turns are secondary structure elements usually classified as coil. their prediction is important, because of their role in protein folding and their frequent occurrence in protein chains.


RESULTS
we have developed a novel method that predicts β-turns and their types using information from multiple sequence alignments, predicted secondary structures and, for the first time, predicted dihedral angles. our method uses support vector machines, a supervised classification technique, and is trained and tested on three established datasets of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> protein chains. we achieve a matthews correlation coefficient of up to  <dig> , when predicting the location of β-turns, the highest reported value to date. moreover, the additional dihedral information improves the prediction of β-turn types i, ii, iv, viii and "non-specific", achieving correlation coefficients up to  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. our results are more accurate than other methods.


CONCLUSIONS
we have created an accurate predictor of β-turns and their types. our method, called debt, is available online at http://comp.chem.nottingham.ac.uk/debt/.
