BACKGROUND
negative energy balance  is an altered metabolic state in high yielding cows that occurs during the first few weeks postpartum when energy demands for lactation and maintenance exceed the energy supply from dietary intake. neb can, in turn, lead to metabolic disorders and to reduced fertility. alterations in the expression of more than  <dig> hepatic genes have previously been reported in a study of neb in postpartum dairy cows. mirnas  are known to mediate many alterations in gene expression post transcriptionally. to study the hepatic mirna content of postpartum dairy cows, including their overall abundance and differential expression, in mild neb  and severe neb , short read rna sequencing was carried out. to identify putative targets of differentially expressed mirnas among differentially expressed hepatic genes reported previously in dairy cows in sneb computational target identification was employed.


RESULTS
our results indicate that the dairy cow liver expresses  <dig> mirnas at a lower threshold of  <dig> reads per million. of these,  <dig> mirnas accounted for greater than 95% of the mirnaome . of the highly expressed mirnas, mir- <dig> constitutes 75% followed by mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  five out of thirteen let- <dig> mirna family members are also among the highly expressed mirnas. mir- <dig>  down-regulated in sneb, was found to have  <dig> putative up-regulated gene targets associated with sneb including lrp <dig> , involved in lipid metabolism and up-regulated in sneb.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first liver mirna-seq profiling study of moderate yielding dairy cows in the early postpartum period. tissue specific mir- <dig> and liver enriched mir- <dig> are two of the most abundant mirnas in the postpartum dairy cow liver. mir- <dig> is significantly down-regulated in sneb and putative targets of mirna- <dig> which are up-regulated in sneb, include a gene involved in lipid metabolism.
