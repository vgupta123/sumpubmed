BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is the principle causative pathogen of osteomyelitis and implant-associated bone infections. it is able to invade and to proliferate inside osteoblasts thus avoiding antibiotic therapy and the host immune system. therefore, development of alternative approaches to stimulate host innate immune responses could be beneficial in prophylaxis against s. aureus infection. tlr <dig> is the intracellular receptor which recognizes unmethylated bacterial cpg-dna and activates immune cells. synthetic cpg-motifs containing oligodeoxynucleotide  mimics the stimulatory effect of bacterial dna.


RESULTS
osteoblast-like saos- <dig> cells were pretreated with cpg-odn type-a  <dig>  type-b  <dig>  or negative cpg-odn  <dig>   <dig> h before infection with s. aureus isolate edcc  <dig> . intracellular bacteria were streaked on bhi plates  <dig> h and  <dig> h after infection. odn <dig> as well as odn <dig> but not odn <dig> were able to significantly inhibit the intracellular bacterial growth because about  <dig> % as well as  <dig> % of intracellular s. aureus could survive the pretreatment of saos- <dig> cells with odn <dig> or odn <dig> respectively  <dig> h and  <dig> h post-infection. rt-pcr analysis of cdnas from saos- <dig> cells showed that pretreatment with odn <dig> or odn <dig> stimulated the expression of tlr <dig>  pretreatment of saos- <dig> cells with odn <dig> or odn <dig> but not odn <dig> managed to induce reactive oxygen species  production inside osteoblasts as measured by flow cytometry analysis. moreover, treating saos- <dig> cells with the antioxidant diphenyleneiodonium  obviously reduced s. aureus killing ability of tlr <dig> agonists mediated by oxidative stress.


CONCLUSIONS
in this work we demonstrated for the first time that cpg-odns have inhibitory effects on s. aureus survival inside saos- <dig> osteoblast-like cell line. this effect was attributed to stimulation of tlr <dig> and subsequent induction of oxidative stress. pretreatment of infected saos- <dig> cells with ros inhibitors resulted in the abolishment of the cpg-odns killing effects.
