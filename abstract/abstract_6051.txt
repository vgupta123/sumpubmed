BACKGROUND
micrornas , which comprise a large family of endogenous small non-coding rna molecules, play important roles in the regulation of gene expression in various biological processes. the chinese rare minnow  is a chinese native fish species and is used extensively as an experimental fish in china; however, relevant biological data, especially mirna transcriptome data, have not been well documented. to discover conserved and potential novel mirnas in chinese rare minnows, a pool of equal amounts of rna obtained from  <dig> different adult rare minnow tissues  was sequenced using illumina deep sequencing technology.


RESULTS
in the present study,  <dig> , <dig> raw reads, representing  <dig> , <dig> unique high-quality reads, were obtained from the pooled small rna library. using bioinformatics analysis,  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel chinese rare minnow mirnas were first discovered and characterized in this study. moreover, we found extensive sequence variations  in rare minnow mirnas, including internal mirna isomirs and terminal isomirs at both the 5′ and 3′ ends and nucleotide variants. six conserved and  <dig> novel mirnas were selected and validated in  <dig> different adult rare minnow tissues using quantitative real-time pcr . the results showed that mir-30a, mir-30b, and novel- <dig> are ubiquitously expressed in a variety of tissues. mir-16a, mir- <dig>  mir-125b, mir-34a, and novel- <dig> were predominantly expressed in the brain. novel- <dig> and novel- <dig> were highly expressed in gills, but were relatively weakly expressed in other tissues. these results provided the expression patterns of mirna genes in chinese rare minnow. finally, based on bioinformatics predictions, we mainly found that novel- <dig> and novel-1b-5p were simultaneously targeted to the 3′utr of dmrt <dig>  which controls sex determination and/or sexual differentiation in a variety of metazoans at different sites. novel-29b targeted the 3′utr of foxl <dig>  which is involved in the maintenance of ovarian function and the transcriptional regulation of gonadal differentiation-related genes. novel- <dig> and novel- <dig> targeted the 3′utr of erbeta <dig> and erbeta <dig> , respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
rare minnow is a widely used model for assessing the risk of environmental pollution in china. identifying and characterizing rare minnow mirna genes is necessary to discover the biological function of mirnas and to screen for new molecule biomarkers to assess the risk of environmental pollution in the future.
