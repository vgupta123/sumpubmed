BACKGROUND
the male germline transcriptome changes dramatically during the mitosis-to-meiosis transition to activate late spermatogenesis genes and to transiently suppress genes commonly expressed in somatic lineages and spermatogenesis progenitor cells, termed somatic/progenitor genes.


RESULTS
these changes reflect epigenetic regulation. induction of late spermatogenesis genes during spermatogenesis is facilitated by poised chromatin established in the stem cell phases of spermatogonia, whereas silencing of somatic/progenitor genes during meiosis and postmeiosis is associated with formation of bivalent domains which also allows the recovery of the somatic/progenitor program after fertilization. importantly, during spermatogenesis mechanisms of epigenetic regulation on sex chromosomes are different from autosomes: x-linked somatic/progenitor genes are suppressed by meiotic sex chromosome inactivation without deposition of h3k27me <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that bivalent h3k27me <dig> and h3k4me2/ <dig> domains are not limited to developmental promoters , but also underlie reversible silencing of somatic/progenitor genes during the mitosis-to-meiosis transition in late spermatogenesis.
