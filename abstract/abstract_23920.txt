BACKGROUND
it has been speculated that the γ-glutamyl transpeptidase  gene is present only in neisseria meningitidis and not among related species such as neisseria gonorrhoeae and neisseria lactamica, because n. meningitidis is the only bacterium with ggt activity. however, nucleotide sequences highly homologous to the meningococcal ggt gene were found in the genomes of n. gonorrhoeae isolates.


RESULTS
the gonococcal homologue  was analyzed. the nucleotide sequence of the ggh gene was approximately  <dig> % identical to that of the meningococcal ggt gene. an open reading frame in the ggh gene was disrupted by an ochre mutation and frameshift mutations induced by a 7-base deletion, but the amino acid sequences deduced from the artificially corrected ggh nucleotide sequences were approximately  <dig> % identical to that of the meningococcal ggt gene. the analyses of the sequences flanking the ggt and ggh genes revealed that both genes were localized in a common dna region containing the fbp-ggt -glya-opca-deda-abcz gene cluster. the expression of the ggh rna could be detected by dot blot, rt-pcr and primer extension analyses. moreover, the truncated form of ggh-translational product was also found in some of the gonococcal isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
this study has shown that the gonococcal ggh gene is a pseudogene of the meningococcal ggt gene, which can also be designated as Ψggt. the gonococcal ggh  gene is the first identified bacterial pseudogene that is transcriptionally active but phenotypically silent.
