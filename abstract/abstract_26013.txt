BACKGROUND
group ii metabotropic glutamate receptors  have been the focus of attention as treatment targets for a number of psychiatric conditions. double knockout mice lacking mglu <dig> and mglu <dig>  show a subtle behavioural phenotype, being hypoactive under basal conditions and in response to amphetamine, and with a spatial memory deficit that depends on the arousal properties of the task. the neurochemical correlates of this profile are unknown. here, we measured tissue levels of dopamine, 5-ht, noradrenaline and their metabolites in the striatum and frontal cortex of mglu2/3−/− double knockout mice, using high performance liquid chromatography. we also measured the same parameters in mglu2−/− and mglu3−/− single knockout mice.


RESULTS
mglu2/3−/−mice had reduced dopamine levels in the striatum but not in frontal cortex, compared to wild-types. in a separate cohort we replicated this deficit and, using tissue punches, found it was more prominent in the nucleus accumbens than in dorsolateral striatum. noradrenaline, 5-ht and their metabolites were not altered in the striatum of mglu2/3−/− mice, although the noradrenaline metabolite mhpg was increased in the cortex. in mglu2−/− and mglu3−/− single knockout mice we found no difference in any monoamine or metabolite, in either brain region, compared to their wild-type littermates.


CONCLUSIONS
group ii metabotropic glutamate receptors impact upon striatal dopamine. the effect may contribute to the behavioural phenotype of mglu2/3−/− mice. the lack of dopaminergic alterations in mglu2−/− and mglu3−/− single knockout mice reveals a degree of redundancy between the two receptors. the findings support the possibility that interactions between mglu2/ <dig> and dopamine may be relevant to the pathophysiology and therapy of schizophrenia and other disorders.
