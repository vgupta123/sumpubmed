BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen that causes biofilm-associated infection in humans. autoinducer  <dig> , a quorum-sensing  signal for interspecies communication, has a wide range of regulatory functions in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, but its exact role in biofilm formation in s. aureus remains unclear.


RESULTS
here we demonstrate that mutation of the ai- <dig> synthase gene luxs in s. aureus rn6390b results in increased biofilm formation compared with the wild-type  strain under static, flowing and anaerobic conditions and in a mouse model. addition of the chemically synthesized ai- <dig> precursor in the luxs mutation strain  restored the wt phenotype. real-time rt-pcr analysis showed that ai- <dig> activated the transcription of icar, a repressor of the ica operon, and subsequently a decreased level of icaa transcription, which was presumably the main reason why luxs mutation influences biofilm formation. furthermore, we compared the roles of the agr-mediated qs system and the luxs/ai- <dig> qs system in the regulation of biofilm formation using the Δluxs strain, rn <dig> and the Δagr Δluxs strain. our data indicate a cumulative effect of the two qs systems on the regulation of biofilm formation in s. aureus.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings demonstrate that ai- <dig> can decrease biofilm formation in s. aureus via an icar-activation pathway. this study may provide clues for therapy in s. aureus biofilm-associated infection.
