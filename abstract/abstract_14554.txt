BACKGROUND
anaesthesia in rabbits is associated with a high mortality rate, compared to that in cats and dogs. total intravenous anaesthesia  with drugs that provide cardiovascular stability and are rapidly metabolised could be of benefit for use in rabbits. the aim was to evaluate cardiorespiratory effects of tiva with sufentanil-midazolam in eight new zealand white rabbits. subcutaneous premedication with medetomidine  was followed by iv administration of a mixture of  <dig>  μg/ml sufentanil and  <dig>  mg/ml midazolam at a rate of  <dig>  ml/kg bw/h for anaesthetic induction. additionally, intravenous boluses of  <dig>  ml of the mixture were administered every  <dig> s until the righting reflex was lost. following endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained for  <dig> min with an infusion rate adjusted to supress the pedal withdrawal reflex. air and oxygen  were delivered at  <dig> l/min. physiological variables were recorded before induction and at predefined time points during and after anaesthesia.


RESULTS
righting and pedal withdrawal reflexes were lost within  <dig> and  <dig> min, respectively. doses of sufentanil and midazolam were  <dig>  μg/kg bw and  <dig>  mg/kg bw for induction, and  <dig>  μg/kg bw/h and  <dig>  mg/kg bw/h for maintenance. apnoea occurred in two rabbits. induction of anaesthesia caused a significant increase in heart rate, cardiac output and arterial co <dig> partial pressure and a decrease in mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate and ph. mean time from stopping the infusion to endotracheal extubation was  <dig> min, and to return of the righting reflex  <dig> min. anaesthesia was characterized by induction and recovery without excitation, with muscle relaxation, and absence of the pedal withdrawal reflex.


CONCLUSIONS
tiva with sufentanil-midazolam provided smooth induction and recovery of anaesthesia in rabbits but with marked hypotension and respiratory depression, requiring mechanical ventilation. further evaluation is needed to establish if the protocol is useful for rabbits undergoing surgery.
