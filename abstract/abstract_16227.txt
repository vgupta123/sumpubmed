BACKGROUND
pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism  assay is a cost-effective method for snp genotyping and mutation detection, but the manual mining for restriction enzyme sites is challenging and cumbersome. three years after we constructed snp-rflping, a freely accessible database and analysis tool for restriction enzyme mining of snps, significant improvements over the  <dig> version have been made and incorporated into the latest version, snp-rflping  <dig> 


RESULTS
the primary aim of snp-rflping  <dig> is to provide comprehensive pcr-rflp information with multiple functionality about snps, such as snp retrieval to multiple species, different polymorphism types , gene-centric searching, hapmap tagsnps, gene ontology-based searching, mirnas, and snp500cancer. the rflp restriction enzymes and the corresponding pcr primers for the natural and mutagenic types of each snp are simultaneously analyzed. all the rflp restriction enzyme prices are also provided to aid selection. furthermore, the previously encountered updating problems for most snp related databases are resolved by an on-line retrieval system.


CONCLUSIONS
the user interfaces for functional snp analyses have been substantially improved and integrated. snp-rflping  <dig> offers a new and user-friendly interface for rflp genotyping that can be used in association studies and is freely available at http://bio.kuas.edu.tw/snp-rflping <dig>
