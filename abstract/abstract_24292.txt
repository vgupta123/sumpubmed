BACKGROUND
wrky transcription factors are one of the largest families of transcriptional regulators in plants. wrky genes are not only found to play significant roles in biotic and abiotic stress response, but also regulate growth and development. grapevine  production is largely limited by stressful climate conditions such as cold stress and the role of wrky genes in the survival of grapevine under these conditions remains unknown.


RESULTS
we identified a total of  <dig> vvwrkys from the v. vinifera genome, belonging to four subgroups according to conserved wrky domains and zinc-finger structure. the majority of vvwrkys were expressed in more than one tissue among the  <dig> tissues examined which included young leaves, mature leaves, tendril, stem apex, root, young fruits and ripe fruits. publicly available microarray data suggested that a subset of vvwrkys was activated in response to diverse stresses. quantitative real-time pcr  results demonstrated that the expression levels of  <dig> vvwrkys are changed following cold exposure. comparative analysis was performed on data from publicly available microarray experiments, previous global transcriptome analysis studies, and qrt-pcr. we identified  <dig> vvwrkys in at least two of these databases which may relate to cold stress. among them, the transcription of three genes can be induced by exogenous aba application, suggesting that they can be involved in an aba-dependent signaling pathway in response to cold stress.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> vvwrkys from the v. vinifera genome and  <dig> of them showed cold stress-induced expression patterns. these genes represented candidate genes for future functional analysis of vvwrkys involved in the low temperature-related signal pathways in grape.
