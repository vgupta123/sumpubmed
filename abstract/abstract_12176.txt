BACKGROUND
orthophosphate recognition at allosteric binding sites is a key feature for the regulation of enzyme activity in mammalian glycogen phosphorylases. protein residues co-ordinating orthophosphate in three binding sites distributed across the dimer interface of a non-regulated bacterial starch phosphorylase  were individually replaced by ala to interrogate their unknown function for activity and stability of this enzyme.


RESULTS
while the mutations affected neither content of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate cofactor nor specific activity in phosphorylase preparations as isolated, they disrupted  or decreased  the unusually strong protective effect of orthophosphate  against inactivation at 45Â°c and subunit dissociation enforced by imidazole, as compared to wild-type enzyme. loss of stability in the mutated phosphorylases appeared to be largely due to weakened affinity for orthophosphate binding. binding of sulphate mimicking the crystallographically observed "non-covalent phosphorylation" of the phosphorylase at the dimer interface did not have an allosteric effect on the enzyme activity.


CONCLUSIONS
the phosphate sites at the subunit-subunit interface of c. callunae starch phosphorylase appear to be cooperatively functional in conferring extra kinetic stability to the native dimer structure of the active enzyme. the molecular strategy exploited for quaternary structure stabilization is to our knowledge novel among dimeric proteins. it can be distinguished clearly from the co-solute effect of orthophosphate on protein thermostability resulting from  interactions of the ligand with protein surface residues.
