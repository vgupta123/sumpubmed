BACKGROUND
in a recent genomic study, leung et al. used a factorial microarray analysis to identify smarca <dig> -regulated genes in micro-dissected zebrafish retinas. two hundred and fifty nine genes were grouped in three-way anova models which carried the most specific retinal change. to validate the microarray results and to elucidate cellular expression patterns of the significant genes for further characterization,  <dig> known genes were randomly selected from this group. in situ hybridization of these genes was performed on the same types of samples  and smarca4a50/a <dig>  mutant) at the same stages ) as in the microarray study.


RESULTS
thirty out of  <dig> riboprobes showed a positive in situ staining signal. twenty seven out of these  <dig> genes were originally further classified as smarca4-regulated retinal genes, while the remaining three as retinal-specific expression independent of smarca <dig> regulation. it was found that  <dig> % of the significant microarray comparisons that were used to identify smarca4-regulated retinal genes had a corresponding qualitative expression change in the in situ hybridization comparisons. this is highly concordant with the theoretical true discovery rate of 95%. hierarchical clustering was used to investigate the similarity of the cellular expression patterns of  <dig> out of the  <dig> smarca4-regulated retinal genes that had a sufficiently high expression signal for an unambiguous identification of retinal expression domains. three broad groups of expression pattern were identified; including 1) photoreceptor layer/outer nuclear layer specific expression at  <dig> hpf, 2) ganglion cell layer  and/or inner nuclear layer  specific expression at both  <dig> &  <dig> hpf, and 3) gcl and/or inl specific expression at  <dig> hpf only. some of these genes have recently been demonstrated to play key roles in retinal cell-type specification, differentiation and lamination. for the remaining three retinal-specific genes that are independent of smarca <dig> regulation, they all had a subtle expression difference between wt and smarca4a50/a <dig> retinas as detected by in situ hybridization. this subtle expression difference was also detected by the original microarray analysis. however, the difference was lower than the fold change cut-off used in that study and hence these genes were not inferred as smarca4-regulated retinal genes.


CONCLUSIONS
this study has successfully investigated the expression pattern of  <dig> genes identified from the original factorial microarray analysis. the results have demonstrated that the true discovery rate for identifying smarca4-regulated retinal genes is  <dig> %. hence, the significant genes from the microarray study are good candidates for cell-type specific markers and will aid further investigation of retinal differentiation.
