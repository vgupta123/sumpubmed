BACKGROUND
we previously showed that a vldl- and ldl-rich mix of human native lipoproteins induces a set of repressive epigenetic marks, i.e. de novo dna methylation, histone  <dig> hypoacetylation and histone  <dig> lysine  <dig>  hypermethylation in thp- <dig> macrophages. here, we: 1) ask what gene expression changes accompany these epigenetic responses; 2) test the involvement of candidate factors mediating the latter. we exploited genome expression arrays to identify target genes for lipoprotein-induced silencing, in addition to rnai and expression studies to test the involvement of candidate mediating factors. the study was conducted in human thp- <dig> macrophages.


RESULTS
native lipoprotein-induced de novo dna methylation was associated with a general repression of various critical genes for macrophage function, including pro-inflammatory genes. lipoproteins showed differential effects on epigenetic marks, as de novo dna methylation was induced by vldl and to a lesser extent by ldl, but not by hdl, and vldl induced h4k <dig> hypermethylation, while hdl caused h <dig> deacetylation. the analysis of candidate factors mediating vldl-induced dna hypermethylation revealed that this response was: 1) surprisingly, mediated exclusively by the canonical maintenance dna methyltransferase dnmt <dig>  and 2) independent of the dicer/micro-rna pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
our work provides novel insights into epigenetic gene regulation by native lipoproteins. furthermore, we provide an example of dnmt <dig> acting as a de novo dna methyltransferase independently of canonical de novo enzymes, and show proof of principle that de novo dna methylation can occur independently of a functional dicer/micro-rna pathway in mammals.
