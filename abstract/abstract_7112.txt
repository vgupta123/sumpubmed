BACKGROUND
classical scrapie is a naturally occurring transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of sheep and goats characterized by cellular accumulation of abnormal isoforms of prion protein  in the central nervous system and the follicles of peripheral lymphoid tissues. previous studies have shown that the whole blood and buffy coat blood fraction of scrapie infected sheep harbor prion infectivity. although prpsc has been detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells , plasma, and more recently within a subpopulation of b lymphocytes, the infectivity status of these cells and plasma in sheep remains unknown. therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether circulating pbmcs, b lymphocytes and platelets from classical scrapie infected sheep harbor prion infectivity using a sheep bioassay.


RESULTS
serial rectal mucosal biopsy and immunohistochemistry were used to detect preclinical infection in lambs transfused with whole blood or blood cell fractions from preclinical or clinical scrapie infected sheep. prpsc immunolabeling was detected in antemortem rectal and postmortem lymphoid tissues from recipient lambs receiving pbmcs , cd72+ b lymphocytes , cd21+ b lymphocytes  or platelet-rich plasma  fractions. as expected, whole blood  and buffy coat  recipients showed positive prpsc labeling in lymphoid follicles. however, at  <dig> days post-transfusion, prpsc was not detected in rectal or other lymphoid tissues in three sheep receiving platelet-poor plasma fraction.


CONCLUSIONS
prion infectivity was detected in circulating pbmcs, cd72+ pan b lymphocytes, the cd21+ subpopulation of b lymphocytes and platelet-rich plasma of classical scrapie infected sheep using a sheep bioassay. combining platelets with b lymphocytes might enhance prpsc detection levels in blood samples.
