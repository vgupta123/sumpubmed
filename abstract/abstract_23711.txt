BACKGROUND
the mechanisms of abortion induced by bacterial infection are largely unknown. in the present study, we investigated abortion induced by brucella abortus, a causative agent of brucellosis and facultative intracellular pathogen, in a mouse model.


RESULTS
high rates of abortion were observed for bacterial infection on day  <dig>  of gestation, but not for other days. regardless of whether fetuses were aborted or stayed alive, the transmission of bacteria into the fetus and bacterial replication in the placenta were observed. there was a higher degree of bacterial colonization in the placenta than in other organs and many bacteria were detected in trophoblast giant cells in the placenta. intracellular growth-defective virb <dig> mutant and attenuated vaccine strain s <dig> did not induce abortion. in the case of abortion, around day  <dig>  of gestation , transient induction of ifn-γ production was observed for infection by the wild type strain, but not by the virb <dig> mutant and s <dig>  neutralization of ifn-γ, whose production was induced by infection with b. abortus, served to prevent abortion.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that abortion induced by b. abortus infection is a result of transient ifn-γ production during the period of placental development.
