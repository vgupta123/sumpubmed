BACKGROUND
the yeast ampk/snf <dig> pathway is best known for its role in glucose de/repression. when glucose becomes limited, the snf <dig> kinase is activated and phosphorylates the transcriptional repressor mig <dig>  which is then exported from the nucleus. the exact mechanism how the snf1-mig <dig> pathway is regulated is not entirely elucidated.


RESULTS
glucose uptake through the low affinity transporter hxt <dig> results in nuclear accumulation of mig <dig> in response to all glucose concentrations upshift, however with increasing glucose concentration the nuclear localization of mig <dig> is more intense. strains expressing hxt <dig> display a constant response to all glucose concentration upshifts. we show that differences in amount of hexose transporter molecules in the cell could cause cell-to-cell variability in the mig1-snf <dig> system. we further apply mathematical modelling to our data, both general deterministic and a nonlinear mixed effect model. our model suggests a presently unrecognized regulatory step of the snf1-mig <dig> pathway at the level of mig <dig> dephosphorylation. model predictions point to parameters involved in the transport of mig <dig> in and out of the nucleus as a majorsource of cell to cell variability.


CONCLUSIONS
with this modelling approach we have been able to suggest steps that contribute to the cell-to-cell variability. our data indicate a close link between the glucose uptake rate, which determines the glycolytic rate, and the activity of the snf1/mig <dig> system. this study hence establishes a close relation between metabolism and signalling.
