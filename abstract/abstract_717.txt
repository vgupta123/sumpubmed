BACKGROUND
transcriptional regulation is normally based on the recognition by a transcription factor of a defined base sequence in a process of direct read-out. however, the nucleic acid secondary and tertiary structure can also act as a recognition site for the transcription factor in a process known as indirect read-out, although this is much less understood. we have previously identified such a transcriptional control mechanism in early xenopus development where the interaction of the transcription factor ilf <dig> and the gata <dig> promoter requires the presence of both an unusual a-form dna structure and a ccaat sequence. rapid identification of such promoters elsewhere in the xenopus and other genomes would provide insight into a less studied area of gene regulation, although currently there are few tools to analyse genomes in such ways.


RESULTS
in this paper we report the implementation of a novel bioinformatics approach that has identified  <dig> such putative promoters in the xenopus genome. we have shown that five of these sites are a-form in solution, bind to transcription factors and fully validated one of these newly identified promoters as interacting with the ilf <dig> containing complex cbtf. this interaction regulates the transcription of a previously uncharacterised downstream gene that is active in early development.


CONCLUSIONS
a perl program  has located a number of potential a-form dna promotor elements in the xenopus genome, five of these putative targets have been experimentally validated as a-form and as targets for specific dna binding proteins; one has also been shown to interact with the a-form binding transcription factor ilf <dig>  apte is available from http://www.port.ac.uk/research/cmd/software/ under the terms of the gnu general public license.
