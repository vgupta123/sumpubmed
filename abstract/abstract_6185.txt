BACKGROUND
arabinogalactan proteins  are cell wall proteoglycans that have been shown to be important for pollen development. an arabidopsis double null mutant for two pollen-specific agps  showed reduced pollen tube growth and compromised response to germination cues in vivo. a microarray experiment was performed on agp <dig> agp <dig> pollen tubes to search for genetic interactions in the context of pollen tube growth. a yeast two-hybrid experiment for agp <dig> and agp <dig> was also designed.


RESULTS
the lack of two specific agps induced a meaningful shift in the gene expression profile. in fact, a high number of genes showed altered expression levels, strengthening the case that agp <dig> and agp <dig> are involved in complex phenomena. the expression levels of calcium- and signaling-related genes were found to be altered, supporting the known roles of the respective proteins in pollen tube growth. although the precise nature of the proposed interactions needs further investigation, the putative involvement of agps in signaling cascades through calmodulin and protein degradation via ubiquitin was indicated. the expression of stress-, as well as signaling- related, genes was also changed; a correlation that may result from the recognized similarities between signaling pathways in both defense and pollen tube growth.

the results of yeast two-hybrid experiments lent further support to these signaling pathways and revealed putative agp <dig> and agp <dig> interactors implicated in recycling of cell membrane components via endocytosis, through clathrin-mediated endosomes and multivesicular bodies.


CONCLUSIONS
the data presented suggest the involvement of agp <dig> and agp <dig> in multiple signaling pathways, in particular those involved in developmental processes such as endocytosis-mediated plasma membrane remodeling during arabidopsis pollen development. this highlights the importance of endosomal trafficking pathways which are rapidly emerging as fundamental regulators of the wall physiology.
