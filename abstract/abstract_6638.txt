BACKGROUND
enterococcus faecium has recently emerged as a multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen involved in outbreaks worldwide. a high rate of resistance to different antibiotics has been associated with virulent clonal complex  <dig> isolates carrying the esp and hyl genes and the purk <dig> allele.


RESULTS
twelve clinical vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium  isolates were obtained from pediatric patients at the hospital infantil de méxico federico gómez . among these vref isolates,  <dig> %  were recovered from urine, while  <dig> %  were recovered from the bloodstream. the vref isolates showed a 100% rate of resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, gentamicin, rifampicin, erythromycin and teicoplanin. in addition,  <dig> %  of the isolates were resistant to linezolid, and  <dig> %  were resistant to tetracycline and doxycycline. pcr analysis revealed the presence of the vana gene in all  <dig> vref isolates, esp in  <dig> %  of the isolates and hyl in 50%  of the isolates. phylogenetic analysis via molecular typing was performed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  and demonstrated 44% similarity among the vref isolates. mlst analysis identified four different sequence types .


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides the first report of multidrug-resistant vref isolates belonging to clonal complex  <dig> from a tertiary care center in mexico city. multidrug resistance and genetic determinants of virulence confer advantages among vref in the colonization of their host. therefore, the prevention and control of the spread of nosocomial infections caused by vref is crucial for identifying new emergent subclones that could be challenging to treat in subsequent years.
