BACKGROUND
the histone h3/h <dig> chaperone asf <dig>  is required for the establishment and maintenance of proper chromatin structure, as well as for genome stability in eukaryotes. asf <dig> participates in both dna replication-coupled  and replication-independent  histone deposition reactions in vitro and interacts with complexes responsible for both pathways in vivo. asf <dig> is known to directly bind histone h <dig>  however, high-resolution structural information about the geometry of this interaction was previously unknown.


RESULTS
here we report the structure of a histone/histone chaperone interaction. we have solved the  <dig>  Ã… crystal structure of the conserved n-terminal immunoglobulin fold domain of yeast asf <dig>  bound to the c-terminal helix of yeast histone h <dig> . the structure defines a histone-binding patch on asf <dig> consisting of both conserved and yeast-specific residues; mutation of these residues abrogates h3/h <dig> binding affinity. the geometry of the interaction indicates that asf <dig> binds to histones h3/h <dig> in a manner that likely blocks sterically the h3/h <dig> interface of the nucleosomal four-helix bundle.


CONCLUSIONS
these data clarify how asf <dig> regulates histone stoichiometry to modulate epigenetic inheritance. the structure further suggests a physical model in which asf <dig> contributes to interpretation of a "histone h <dig> barcode" for sorting h <dig> isoforms into different deposition pathways.
