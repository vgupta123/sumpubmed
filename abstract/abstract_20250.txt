BACKGROUND
inward rectifier potassium channels  contribute to the normal function of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. the chick inward rectifier k+ channel cirk1/kir <dig>  is expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, brain, but not in liver; a distribution similar but not identical to that of mouse kir <dig> . we set out to explore regulatory domains of the cirk <dig> promoter that enhance or inhibit expression of the gene in different cell types.


RESULTS
we cloned and characterized the 5'-flanking region of cirk <dig>  cirk <dig> contains two exons with splice sites in the 5'-untranslated region, a structure similar to mouse and human orthologs. cirk <dig> has multiple transcription initiation sites, a feature also seen in mouse. however, while the chicken and mouse promoter regions share many regulatory motifs, cirk <dig> possesses a gc-richer promoter and a putative tata box, which appears to positively regulate gene expression. we report here the identification of several candidate cell/tissue specific cirk <dig> regulatory domains by comparing promoter activities in expressing  and non-expressing  cells using in vitro transcription assays.


CONCLUSIONS
while multiple transcription initiation sites and the combinatorial function of several domains in activating cirk <dig> expression are similar to those seen in mkir <dig> , the cirk <dig> promoter differs by the presence of a putative tata box. in addition, several domains that regulate the gene's expression differentially in muscle  and fibroblast cells  were identified. these results provide fundamental data to analyze cirk <dig> transcriptional mechanisms. the control elements identified here may provide clues to the tissue-specific expression of this k+ channel.
