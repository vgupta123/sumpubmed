BACKGROUND
based on inhibition tests, the alpha6beta <dig> integrin was suggested to be a sperm receptor, but further experiments using gene deletion techniques have shown that neither oocyte alpha <dig>  nor beta <dig> integrin subunits were essential for mouse fertilization.


RESULTS
using western blot analysis and immunofluorescence, we showed that the mouse sperm expresses the alpha6beta <dig> integrin. as for oocyte, binding of goh <dig> anti-alpha <dig> antibody to sperm induces a specific inhibition of sperm fertilizing ability. comparing zona-intact and zona-free eggs in fusion tests, we showed that the removal of the zona pellucida by acid treatment bypasses fertilizing oocyte alpha6beta <dig> integrin's function in the adhesion/fusion process.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings show that alpha6beta <dig> integrin is expressed by both gametes and is functional in their membranes interaction. these results and previous reports, about fertilization of alpha <dig> or beta <dig> integrin subunits deleted oocytes by wild type sperm, suggest that the presence of alpha6beta <dig> integrin on one of the two gamete membranes can rescue the fertilization process. this hypothesis is further supported by the exchange of membrane fragments occurring between gametes prior to fusion that we recently reported.
