BACKGROUND
the osa <dig> genome annotation of rice  is the product of a semi-automated pipeline that does not explicitly predict pseudogenes. as such, it is likely to mis-annotate pseudogenes as functional genes. a total of  <dig>  gene models within the osa <dig> release  <dig> were investigated as potential pseudogenes as these genes exhibit at least one feature potentially indicative of pseudogenes: lack of transcript support, short coding region, long untranslated region, or, for genes residing within a segmentally duplicated region, lack of a paralog or significantly shorter corresponding paralog.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  pseudogenes, identified among genes with pseudogene features, were characterized by similarity to fully-supported gene models and the presence of frameshifts or premature translational stop codons. significant difference in the length of duplicated genes within segmentally-duplicated regions was the optimal indicator of pseudogenization. among the  <dig> pseudogenes for which a probable origin could be determined, 75% originated from gene duplication events while 25% were the result of retrotransposition events. a total of 12% of the pseudogenes were expressed. finally, f-box proteins, btb/poz proteins, terpene synthases, chalcone synthases and cytochrome p <dig> protein families were found to harbor large numbers of pseudogenes.


CONCLUSIONS
these pseudogenes still have a detectable open reading frame and are thus distinct from pseudogenes detected within intergenic regions which typically lack definable open reading frames. families containing the highest number of pseudogenes are fast-evolving families involved in ubiquitination and secondary metabolism.
