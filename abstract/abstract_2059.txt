BACKGROUND
biofilms occur on a wide variety of surfaces including metals, ceramics, glass etc. and often leads to accumulation of large number of various microorganisms on the surfaces. this biofilm growth is highly undesirable in most cases as biofilms can cause degradation of the instruments and its performance along with contamination of the samples being processed in those systems. the current “offline” biofilm removal methods are effective but labor intensive and generates waste streams that are toxic to be directly disposed. we present here a novel process that uses nano-energetic materials to eliminate biofilms in < 1 second. the process involves spray-coating a thin layer of nano-energetic material on top of the biofilm, allowing it to dry, and igniting the dried coating to incinerate the biofilm.


RESULTS
the nanoenergetic material is a mixture of aluminum  nanoparticles dispersed in a thv-220a  matrix. upon ignition, the al nanoparticles react with thv-220a exothermically, producing high temperatures  for an extremely brief period  that destroys the biofilm underneath. however, since the total amount of heat produced is low , the underlying surface remains undamaged. surfaces with biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa initially harboring ~ 107 cfu of bacteria /cm <dig> displayed final counts of less than 5 cfu/cm <dig> after being subjected to our process. the byproducts of the process consist only of washable carbonaceous residue and gases, making this process potentially inexpensive due to low toxic-waste disposal costs.


CONCLUSIONS
this novel method of biofilm removal is currently in the early stage of development. however, it has potential to be used in offline biofilm elimination as a rapid, easy and environmentally friendly method.
