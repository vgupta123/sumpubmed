BACKGROUND
antibiotic resistance has become a serious global problem and is steadily increasing worldwide in almost every bacterial species treated with antibiotics. in aquaculture, the therapeutic options for the treatment of a. hydrophila infection were only limited to several antibiotics, which contributed for the fast-speed emergence of drug tolerance. accordingly, the aim of this study was to establish a medication regimen to prevent drug resistant bacteria. to determine a rational therapeutic guideline, integrated pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics parameters were based to predict dose and dosage interval of enrofloxacin in grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella infected by a field-isolated a. hydrophila strain.


RESULTS
the pathogenic a. hydrophila strain  in grass carp was identified and found to be sensitive to enrofloxacin. the mutant selection window  of enrofloxacin on isolate ah <dig> was determined to be  <dig>  -  <dig> μg/ml based on the mutant prevention concentration  and minimum inhibitory concentration  value. by using high-performance liquid chromatography  system, the pharmacokinetic  parameters of enrofloxacin and its metabolite ciprofloxacin in grass carp were monitored after a single oral gavage of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> μg enrofloxacin per g body weight. dosing of  <dig> μg/g resulted in serum maximum concentration  of  <dig>  μg/ml, and concentration in serum was above mpc till  <dig> h post the single dose. once-daily dosing of  <dig> μg/g was determined to be the rational choice for controlling ah <dig> infection and preventing mutant selection in grass carp. data of mean residue time  and body clearance  indicated that both enrofloxacin and its metabolite ciprofloxacin present similar eliminating rate and pattern in serum, muscle and liver. a withdraw time of more than  <dig> d was suggested based on the drug eliminating rate and pharmacokinetic model described by a polyexponential equation.


CONCLUSIONS
based on integrated pk/pd parameters , the results of this study established a principle, for the first time, on drawing accurate dosing guideline for pharmacotherapy against a. hydrophila strain  for prevention of drug-resistant mutants. our approach in combining pk data with pd parameters  was the new effort in aquaculture to face the challenge of drug resistance by drawing a specific dosage guideline of antibiotics.
