BACKGROUND
infectious diseases in plants, animals and humans are often transmitted indirectly between hosts , i.e. via some route through the environment instead of via direct contacts between these hosts. here we study indirect transmission experimentally, using transmission of campylobacter jejuni  between spatially separated broilers as a model system. we distinguish three stages in the process of indirect transmission;  an infectious “sender” excretes the agent, after which  the agent is transported via some route to a susceptible “receiver”, and subsequently  the receiver becomes colonised by the agent. the role of the sender and receiver side  was studied here by using acidification of the drinking water as a modulation mechanism.


RESULTS
in the experiment one control group and three treatment groups were monitored for the presence of c. jejuni by taking daily cloacal swabs. the three treatments consisted of acidification of the drinking water of the inoculated animals , acidification of the drinking water of the susceptible animals  or acidification of the drinking water of both inoculated and susceptible animals. in the control group  <dig> animals got colonised out of a possible  <dig>  in each treatment groups  <dig> animals out of a possible  <dig> were found colonised with c. jejuni.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of the experiments show a significant decrease in transmission rate  between the control groups and treatment groups  but not between different treatments; there is a significant negative interaction effect when both the sender and the receiver group receive acidified drinking water . this negative interaction effect could be due to selection of bacteria already at the sender side thereby diminishing the effect of acidification at the receiver side.
