BACKGROUND
n-terminal domains of bvu_ <dig> and bf <dig> proteins from bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides fragilis respectively are members of the pfam family pf <dig> . proteins containing a domain from this family can be found in most bacteroides species and, in large numbers, in all human gut microbiome samples. both bvu_ <dig> and bf <dig> proteins have a consensus lipobox motif implying they are anchored to the membrane, but their functions are otherwise unknown. the c-terminal half of bvu_ <dig> is assigned to protein family pf <dig> ; the equivalent part of bf <dig> was unclassified.


RESULTS
crystal structures of both bvu_ <dig> and bf <dig> proteins, solved at the jcsg center, show strikingly similar three-dimensional structures. the main difference between the two is that the two domains in the bvu_ <dig> protein are connected by a short linker, as opposed to a longer insertion made of  <dig> helices placed linearly along with a strand that is added to the c-terminal domain in the bf <dig> protein. the n-terminal domain in both proteins, corresponding to the pf <dig>  domain is a β–sandwich with pre-albumin-like fold, found in many proteins belonging to the transthyretin clan of pfam. the structures of c-terminal domains of both proteins, corresponding to the pf <dig>  domain in bvu_ <dig> protein and an unclassified domain in the bf <dig> protein, show significant structural similarity to bacterial pore-forming toxins. a helix in this domain is in an analogous position to a loop connecting the second and third strands in the toxin structures, where this loop is implicated to play a role in the toxin insertion into the host cell membrane. the same helix also points to the groove between the n- and c-terminal domains that are loosely held together by hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions. the presence of several conserved residues in this region together with these structural determinants could make it a functionally important region in these proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
structural analysis of bvu_ <dig> and bf <dig> points to possible roles in mediating multiple interactions on the cell-surface/extracellular matrix. in particular the n-terminal domain could be involved in adhesive interactions, the c-terminal domain and the inter-domain groove in lipid or carbohydrate interactions.
