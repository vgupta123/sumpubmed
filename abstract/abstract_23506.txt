BACKGROUND
mechano-transduction in periodontal ligament  cells is crucial for physiological and orthodontic tooth movement-associated periodontal remodelling. on the mechanistic level, molecules involved in this mechano-transduction process in pdl cells are not yet completely elucidated.


RESULTS
in the present study we show by western blot  analysis and/or indirect immunofluorescence  that mechanical strain modulates the amount of the matrix metalloproteinase mmp- <dig>  and induces non-coherent modulation in the amount and activity of signal transducing molecules, such as fak, map-kinases p42/ <dig>  and p <dig> stress kinase, suggesting their mechanistic role in mechano-transduction. increase in the amount of fak occurs concomitant with increased levels of the focal contact integrin subunits β <dig> and β <dig>  as indicated by wb or optionally by iif. by employing specific inhibitors, we further identified p42/ <dig> and p <dig> in their activated, i.e. phosphorylated state responsible for the expression of mmp- <dig>  this finding may point to the obedience in the expression of this mmp as extracellular matrix  remodelling executioner from the activation state of mechano-transducing molecules. mrna analysis by pathway-specific rt-profiler arrays revealed up- and/or down-regulation of genes assigning to map-kinase signalling and cell cycle, ecm and integrins and growth factors. up-regulated genes include for example focal contact integrin subunit α <dig>  mmp- <dig>  map-kinases and associated kinases, and the transcription factor c-fos, the latter as constituent of the ap1-complex addressing the mmp- <dig> promotor. among others, genes down-regulated are those of col- <dig> and col- <dig>  suggesting that strain-dependent mechano-transduction may transiently perturbate ecm homeostasis.


CONCLUSIONS
strain-dependent mechano-/signal-transduction in pdl cells involves abundance and activity of fak, map-kinases p42/ <dig>  and p <dig> stress kinase in conjunction with the amount of mmp- <dig>  and integrin subunits β <dig> and β <dig>  identifying the activated state of p42/ <dig> and p <dig> as critical for mmp- <dig> expression may indicate the mechanistic contribution of mechano-transducing molecules on executioners of ecm homeostasis.
