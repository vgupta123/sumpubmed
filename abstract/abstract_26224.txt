BACKGROUND
fear/anxiety and anger/aggression greatly influence health, quality of life and social interactions. they are a huge burden to wellbeing, and personal and public economics. however, while much is known about the physiology and neuroanatomy of such emotions, little is known about their genetics – most importantly, why some individuals are more susceptible to pathology under stress.


RESULTS
we conducted genomewide association  mapping of breed stereotypes for many fear and aggression traits across several hundred dogs from diverse breeds. we confirmed those findings using gwa in a second cohort of partially overlapping breeds. lastly, we used the validated loci to create a model that effectively predicted fear and aggression stereotypes in a third group of dog breeds that were not involved in the mapping studies. we found that i) known igf <dig> and hmga <dig> loci variants for small body size are associated with separation anxiety, touch-sensitivity, owner directed aggression and dog rivalry; and ii) two loci, between gnat <dig> and cd <dig> on chr <dig>  and near igsf <dig> on chrx, are associated with several traits, including touch-sensitivity, non-social fear, and fear and aggression that are directed toward unfamiliar dogs and humans. all four genome loci are among the most highly evolutionarily-selected in dogs, and each of those was previously shown to be associated with morphological traits. we propose that the igf <dig> and hmga <dig> loci are candidates for identical variation being associated with both behavior and morphology. in contrast, we show that the gnat3-cd <dig> locus has distinct variants for behavior and morphology. the chrx region is a special case due to its extensive linkage disequilibrium . our evidence strongly suggests that sociability  and fear/aggression are two distinct gwa loci within this ld block on chrx, but there is almost perfect ld between the peaks for fear/aggression and animal size.


CONCLUSIONS
we have mapped many canine fear and aggression traits to single haplotypes at the gnat3-cd <dig> and igsf <dig> loci. cd <dig> is widely expressed, but areas of the amygdala and hypothalamus are among the brain regions with highest enrichment; and cd36-knockout mice are known to have significantly increased anxiety and aggression. both of the other genes have very high tissue-specificity and are very abundantly expressed in brain regions that comprise the core anatomy of fear and aggression – the amygdala to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis. we propose that reduced-fear variants at these loci may have been involved in the domestication process.
