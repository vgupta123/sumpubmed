BACKGROUND
late embryogenesis abundant  proteins are involved in protecting higher plants from damage caused by environmental stresses. foxtail millet  is an important cereal crop for food and feed in semi-arid areas. however, the molecular mechanisms underlying tolerance to these conditions are not well defined.


RESULTS
here, we characterized a novel atypical lea gene named silea <dig> from foxtail millet. it contains two exons separated by one intron. silea <dig> was expressed in roots, stems, leaves, inflorescences and seeds at different levels under normal growth conditions. in addition, silea <dig> was dramatically induced by osmotic stress, nacl and exogenous abscisic acid. the silea <dig> protein was localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. overexpression of silea <dig> improved escherichia coli growth performance compared with the control under salt stress. to further assess the function of silea <dig> in plants, transgenic arabidopsis and foxtail millet plants that overexpressed silea <dig> were obtained. the transgenic arabidopsis seedlings showed higher tolerance to salt and osmotic stress than the wild type . similarly, the transgenic foxtail millet showed improved growth under salt and drought stresses compared with the wt. taken together, our results indicated that silea <dig> is a novel atypical lea protein and plays important roles in resistance to abiotic stresses in plants.


CONCLUSIONS
we characterized a novel atypical lea gene silea <dig> from foxtail millet, which plays important roles in plant abiotic stress resistance. modification of silea <dig> expression may improve abiotic stress resistance in agricultural crops.
