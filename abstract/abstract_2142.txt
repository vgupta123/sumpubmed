BACKGROUND
the oddball paradigm is widely applied to the investigation of cognitive function in neuroscience and in neuropsychiatry. whether cortical oscillation in the resting state can predict the elicited oddball event-related potential  is still not clear. this study explored the relationship between resting electroencephalography  and oddball erps. the regional powers of  <dig> electrodes across delta, theta, alpha and beta frequencies were correlated with the amplitude and latency of n <dig>  p <dig>  n <dig> and p <dig> components of oddball erps. a multivariate analysis based on partial least squares  was applied to further examine the spatial pattern revealed by multiple correlations.


RESULTS
higher synchronization in the resting state, especially at the alpha spectrum, is associated with higher neural responsiveness and faster neural propagation, as indicated by the higher amplitude change of n1/n <dig> and shorter latency of p <dig>  none of the resting quantitative eeg indices predict p <dig> latency and amplitude. the pls analysis confirms that the resting cortical dynamics which explains n1/n <dig> amplitude and p <dig> latency does not show regional specificity, indicating a global property of the brain.


CONCLUSIONS
this study differs from previous approaches by relating dynamics in the resting state to neural responsiveness in the activation state. our analyses suggest that the neural characteristics carried by resting brain dynamics modulate the earlier/automatic stage of target detection.
