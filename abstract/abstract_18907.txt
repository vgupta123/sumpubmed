BACKGROUND
we investigated the molecular characteristics of multidrug-resistant, extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase -producing enterobacteriaceae isolated in community settings and in hospitals in antananarivo, madagascar.


RESULTS
forty-nine e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca and e. cloacae esbl-producing isolates were studied. in antimicrobial susceptibility analyses, many of the isolates exhibited resistance to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. gene amplification analysis and sequencing revealed that  <dig> %  of the isolates harbored blactx-m- <dig> and  <dig> %  harbored blashv- <dig>  the non-esbls resistance genes detected were blatem- <dig>  blaoxa- <dig>  aac-ib,aac-ib-cr, teta, sul- <dig>  sul- <dig>  qnra, qnrb and catb- <dig>  we found dfra and aada gene cassettes in the class  <dig> integron variable regions of the isolates, and the combination of dfra17-aada <dig> to be the most prevalent. all blactx-m- <dig> positive isolates also contained the isecp <dig> insertion element. conjugation and transformation experiments indicated that  <dig> % of the antibiotic resistance genes resided on plasmids. through a pcr based replicon typing method, plasmids carrying the blashv- <dig> or blactx-m- <dig> genes were assigned to either the incfii replicon type or, rarely, to the hi <dig> replicon type. all isolates were subtyped by the rep-pcr and eric-pcr methods.

phylogenetic grouping and virulence genotyping of the e. coli isolates revealed that most of them belonged to group a <dig>  one isolate assigned to group b <dig> harbored blactx-m- <dig> and five virulence genes  and was related to the o25b-st <dig> clone.


CONCLUSIONS
our results highlight the dissemination of multidrug resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates in antananarivo. these findings underline the need for a rational use of antibiotic and for appropriate methods of screening esbl in routine laboratories in antananarivo.
