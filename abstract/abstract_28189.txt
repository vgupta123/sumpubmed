BACKGROUND
the large amount of data used in genomic analysis has allowed geneticists to achieve some understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits. although the information gathered by molecular markers has permitted gains in predictive accuracy and gene discovery, epistatic effects have been ignored based on exhaustive searches requesting estimates of its effects on the whole genome. in this work, we propose the reversible-jump technique to estimate epistasis in the genome without drastically altering the model dimension. to this end, we used a real maize dataset based on 256 f2: <dig> progenies plus a simulation data set based on 300 f <dig> individuals. in the simulation scenario, six qtl presenting main effects  were combined with seven other epistatic effects totaling  <dig> qtl controlling the trait.


RESULTS
our model explored  <dig>  candidate epistases, but even in this vast space, only one spurious interaction was found. the three epistases selected by our model, named here as 18x <dig>  56x <dig> and 59x <dig>  were very close to simulated ones . in the real dataset, we estimate  <dig>  epistatic effects, and several minor epistatic combinations were found to explain a significant proportion of the genetic variance. the broad participation of epistasis in the real dataset may indicate the presence of pervasive epistasis acting on maize grain yield.


CONCLUSIONS
the power of selecting true epistasis in thousands of possible combinations suggests the attractiveness of our model to handle genomic data
