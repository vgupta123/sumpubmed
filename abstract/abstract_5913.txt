BACKGROUND
high growth  modifier and background independent quantitative trait loci  affecting growth, adiposity and carcass composition were previously identified on mouse chromosomes   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  to confirm and further characterize each qtl, two panels of speed congenic strains were developed by introgressing cast/eij  qtl alleles onto either mutant c57bl/6j-hg/hg  or wild type c57bl/6j  genetic backgrounds.


RESULTS
the first speed congenic panel was developed by introgressing four overlapping donor regions spanning mmu <dig> in its entirety onto both hg and b <dig> backgrounds, for a total of eight strains. phenotypic characterization of the mmu <dig> panel confirmed the segregation of multiple growth and obesity qtl and strongly suggested that a subset of these loci modify the effects of the hg deletion. the second panel consisted of individual donor regions on an hg background for each qtl on mmu <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  of the six developed strains, five were successfully characterized and displayed significant differences in growth and/or obesity as compared to controls. all five displayed phenotypes similar to those originally attributed to each qtl, however, novel phenotypes were unmasked in several of the strains including sex-specific effects.


CONCLUSIONS
the speed congenic strains developed herein constitute an invaluable genomic resource and provide the foundation to identify the specific nature of genetic variation influencing growth and obesity.
