BACKGROUND
klebsiella pneumoniae strains are pathogenic to animals and humans, in which they are both a frequent cause of nosocomial infections and a re-emerging cause of severe community-acquired infections. k. pneumoniae isolates of the capsular serotype k <dig> are among the most virulent. in order to identify novel putative virulence factors that may account for the severity of k <dig> infections, the genome sequence of the k <dig> reference strain kp <dig>  was determined and compared to two k <dig> and k <dig> strains of low virulence and to the reference strains mgh  <dig> and ntuh-k <dig> 


RESULTS
in addition to diverse functions related to host colonization and virulence encoded in genomic regions common to the four strains, four genomic islands specific for kp <dig>  were identified. these regions encoded genes for the synthesis of colibactin toxin, a putative cytotoxin outer membrane protein, secretion systems, nucleases and eukaryotic-like proteins. in addition, an insertion within a type vi secretion system locus included sel <dig> domain containing proteins and a phospholipase d family protein . the pld <dig> mutant was avirulent in a pneumonia model in mouse. the pld <dig> mrna was expressed in vivo and the pld <dig> gene was associated with k. pneumoniae isolates from severe infections. analysis of lipid composition of a defective e. coli strain complemented with pld <dig> suggests an involvement of pld <dig> in cardiolipin metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
determination of the complete genome of the k <dig> reference strain identified several genomic islands comprising putative elements of pathogenicity. the role of pld <dig> in pathogenesis was demonstrated for the first time and suggests that lipid metabolism is a novel virulence mechanism of k. pneumoniae.
