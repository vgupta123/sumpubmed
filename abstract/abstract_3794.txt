BACKGROUND
amaranthus hypochondriacus, a grain amaranth, is a c <dig> plant noted by its ability to tolerate stressful conditions and produce highly nutritious seeds. these possess an optimal amino acid balance and constitute a rich source of health-promoting peptides. although several recent studies, mostly involving subtractive hybridization strategies, have contributed to increase the relatively low number of grain amaranth expressed sequence tags , transcriptomic information of this species remains limited, particularly regarding tissue-specific and biotic stress-related genes. thus, a large scale transcriptome analysis was performed to generate stem- and biotic stress-responsive gene expression profiles in grain amaranth.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were obtained from six  <dig> pyrosequencing runs, which were assembled into  <dig>  high quality sequences . the average sequence length was  <dig>  bp and  <dig> bp for isotigs and contigs, respectively. only  <dig>  singletons were recovered after quality control. contigs/isotigs were further incorporated into  <dig>  isogroups. all unique sequences were queried against the nr, tair, uniref <dig>  uniref <dig> and amaranthaceae est databases for annotation. functional go annotation was performed with all contigs/isotigs that produced significant hits with the tair database. only  <dig>  sequences were found to be homologous when the transcriptomes of a. tuberculatus and a. hypochondriacus were compared, most of which were associated with basic house-keeping processes. digital expression analysis identified  <dig>  differentially expressed genes in response to at least one of four stress treatments tested. these included several multiple-stress-inducible genes that could represent potential candidates for use in the engineering of stress-resistant plants. the transcriptomic data generated from pigmented stems shared similarity with findings reported in developing stems of arabidopsis and black cottonwood .


CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the first large-scale transcriptomic analysis of a. hypochondriacus, considered to be a highly nutritious and stress-tolerant crop. numerous genes were found to be induced in response to biotic stress, many of which could further the understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to multiple stress-resistance in plants, a trait that has potential biotechnological applications in agriculture.
