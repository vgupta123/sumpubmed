BACKGROUND
researchers wishing to conduct genetic association analysis involving single nucleotide polymorphisms  or haplotypes are often confronted with the lack of user-friendly graphical analysis tools, requiring sophisticated statistical and informatics expertise to perform relatively straightforward tasks. tools, such as the simhap package for the r statistics language, provide the necessary statistical operations to conduct sophisticated genetic analysis, but lacks a graphical user interface that allows anyone but a professional statistician to effectively utilise the tool.


RESULTS
we have developed simhap gui, a cross-platform integrated graphical analysis tool for conducting epidemiological, single snp and haplotype-based association analysis. simhap gui features a novel workflow interface that guides the user through each logical step of the analysis process, making it accessible to both novice and advanced users. this tool provides a seamless interface to the simhap r package, while providing enhanced functionality such as sophisticated data checking, automated data conversion, and real-time estimations of haplotype simulation progress.


CONCLUSIONS
simhap gui provides a novel, easy-to-use, cross-platform solution for conducting a range of genetic and non-genetic association analyses. this provides a free alternative to commercial statistics packages that is specifically designed for genetic association analysis.
