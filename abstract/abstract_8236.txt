BACKGROUND
non-typeable haemophilus influenzae biofilm formation is implicated in a number of chronic infections including otitis media, sinusitis and bronchitis. biofilm structure includes cells and secreted extracellular matrix that is "slimy" and believed to contribute to the antibiotic resistant properties of biofilm bacteria. components of biofilm extracellular matrix are largely unknown. in order to identify such biofilm proteins an ex-vivo biofilm of a non-typeable haemophilus influenzae isolate, originally from an otitis media patent, was produced by on-filter growth. extracellular matrix fraction was subjected to proteomic analysis via lc-ms/ms to identify proteins.


RESULTS
 <dig> proteins were identified in the extracellular matrix sample. the identified proteins were analyzed for cog grouping and predicted cellular location via the tmhmm and signalp predictive algorithms. the most over-represented cog groups identified compared to their frequency in the haemophilus influenzae genome were cell motility and secretion  followed by ribosomal proteins of group j. a number of hypothetical or un-characterized proteins were observed, as well as proteins previously implicated in biofilm function.


CONCLUSIONS
this study represents an initial approach to identifying and cataloguing numerous proteins associated with biofilm structure. the approach can be applied to biofilms of other bacteria to look for commonalities of expression and obtained information on biofilm protein expression can be used in multidisciplinary approaches to further understand biofilm structure and function.
