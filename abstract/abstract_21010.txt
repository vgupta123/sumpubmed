BACKGROUND
infectious laryngotracheitis virus  infection causes high mortality and huge economic losses in the poultry industry. to protect chickens against iltv infection, chicken-embryo origin  and tissue-culture origin  vaccines have been used. however, the transmission of vaccine iltv from vaccinated- to unvaccinated chickens can cause severe respiratory disease. previously, host cell responses against virulent iltv infections were determined by microarray analysis. in this study, a microarray analysis was performed to understand host-vaccine iltv interactions at the host gene transcription level.


RESULTS
the  <dig> k chicken oligo microarrays were used, and the results were compared to those found in virulent iltv infection. total rnas extracted from vaccine iltv infected chicken embryo lung cells at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days post infection , compared to  <dig> dpi, were subjected to microarray assay using the two color hybridization method. data analysis using jmp genomics  <dig>  and the ingenuity pathway analysis  program showed that  <dig> differentially expressed genes could be grouped into a number of functional categories including tissue development, cellular growth and proliferation, cellular movement, and inflammatory responses. moreover,  <dig> possible gene networks were created by the ipa program to show intermolecular connections. interestingly, of  <dig> differentially expressed genes, bmp <dig>  c8orf <dig>  f <dig>  and npy were expressed distinctly in vaccine iltv infection when compared to virulent iltv infection.


CONCLUSIONS
comprehensive knowledge of gene expression and biological functionalities of host factors during vaccine iltv infection can provide insight into host cellular defense mechanisms compared to those of virulent iltv.
