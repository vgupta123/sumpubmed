BACKGROUND
for 2-dye microarray platforms, some missing values may arise from an un-measurably low rna expression in one channel only. information of such "one-channel depletion" is so far not included in algorithms for imputation of missing values.


RESULTS
calculating the mean deviation between imputed values and duplicate controls in five datasets, we show that knn-based imputation gives a systematic bias of the imputed expression values of one-channel depleted spots. evaluating the correction of this bias by cross-validation showed that the mean square deviation between imputed values and duplicates were reduced up to 51%, depending on dataset.


CONCLUSIONS
by including more information in the imputation step, we more accurately estimate missing expression values.
