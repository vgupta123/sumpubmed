BACKGROUND
chlamydiaceae is a family of obligate intracellular pathogens with a worldwide distribution in many animal species, including humans. no information exists on the prevalence of chlamydia felis infections in cats and dogs in lanzhou, the geographical center of china. the aim of this study was to carry out a census of cats and dogs in lanzhou and document the seroprevalence of c. felis exposure in these companion animals.


RESULTS
in this study, blood samples were collected from  <dig> animals  in lanzhou between november  <dig> and july  <dig> to identify antibodies against c. felis. thirteen of  <dig>  cats and  <dig> of  <dig>  pet dogs were positive for c. felis infection using indirect hemagglutination at a cutoff of 1: <dig>  the seroprevalence in household and stray cats was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant . among different age groups, the seroprevalence in cats varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, and that in dogs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %; however, the differences were not statistically significant .


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of the seroprevalence of c. felis exposure in cats and dogs in lanzhou, northwestern china. our results indicate that the presence of c. felis exposure in cats and dogs may pose a potential threat to human health.
