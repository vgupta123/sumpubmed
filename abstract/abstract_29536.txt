BACKGROUND
telomere function requires a highly conserved g rich 3'- overhang. this structure is formed by 5'-resection of the c-rich telomere strand. however, while many nucleases have been suggested to play a role in processing, it is not yet clear which nucleases carry out this 5'-resection.


RESULTS
we used biochemical purification to identify a sequence-dependent exonuclease activity in tetrahymena thermophila cell extracts. the nuclease activity showed specificity for 5'-ends containing aa or ac sequences, unlike exo <dig>  which showed sequence-independent cleavage. the tetrahymena nuclease was active on both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated substrates whereas exo <dig> requires a 5'-phosphate for cleavage.


CONCLUSIONS
the specificities of the enzyme indicate that this novel tetrahymena exonuclease is distinct from exo <dig> and has properties required for 3'-overhang formations at telomeres.
