BACKGROUND
as a novel candidate metastasis suppressor gene, nasopharyngeal carcinoma-associated gene  <dig>  is involved in cellular growth, cell cycle progression and tumor angiogenesis. previous studies have shown that ngx <dig> gene is down-regulated in colorectal cancer . however, little is known about its transcriptional regulation.


RESULTS
we defined the minimal promoter of ngx <dig> gene in a 186-bp region  through mutation construct methods and luciferase assays. results from electrophoretic mobility shift assays  and chromatin immunoprecipitation  revealed that early growth response gene  <dig>  binds to the sp1/egr- <dig> overlapping site of ngx <dig> minimal promoter. overexpression of egr- <dig> increased the promoter activity and mrna level of ngx <dig> gene; while knock-down of endogenous egr- <dig> decreased mrna expression of ngx <dig> gene.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate that egr- <dig> regulates ngx <dig> gene transcription through an overlapping sp1/egr- <dig> binding site as a positive regulator of ngx <dig> gene.
