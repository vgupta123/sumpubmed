BACKGROUND
due to the unparalleled genetic diversity of its peoples, africa is attracting growing research attention. several african populations have been assessed in global initiatives such as the international hapmap and  <dig> genomes projects. notably excluded, however, is the southern africa region, which is inhabited predominantly by southeastern bantu-speakers, currently suffering under the dual burden of infectious and non-communicable diseases. limited reference data for these individuals hampers medical research and prevents thorough understanding of the underlying population substructure. here, we present the most detailed exploration, to date, of genetic diversity in  <dig> unrelated southeastern bantu-speaking south africans, resident in urban soweto .


RESULTS
participants were typed for ~ <dig>  million snps using the illumina omni <dig> beadchip. pca and admixture plots were used to compare the observed variation with that seen in selected populations worldwide. results indicated that sowetans, and other southeastern bantu-speakers, are a clearly distinct group from other african populations previously investigated, reflecting a unique genetic history with small, but significant contributions from diverse sources. to assess the suitability of our sample as representative of sowetans, we compared our results to participants in a larger rheumatoid arthritis caseâ€“control study. the control group showed good clustering with our sample, but among the cases were individuals who demonstrated notable admixture.


CONCLUSIONS
sowetan population structure appears unique compared to other black africans, and may have clinical implications. our data represent a suitable reference set for southeastern bantu-speakers, on par with a hapmap type reference population, and constitute a prelude to the southern african human genome programme.
