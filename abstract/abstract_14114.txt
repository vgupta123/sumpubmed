BACKGROUND
it has yet to be determined whether visual-tactile cross-modal plasticity due to visual deprivation, particularly in the primary visual cortex , is solely due to visual deprivation or if it is a result of long-term tactile training. here we conducted an fmri study with normally-sighted participants who had undergone long-term training on the tactile shape discrimination of the two dimensional  shapes on mah-jong tiles . eight mah-jong experts and twelve healthy volunteers who were naïve to mah-jong performed a tactile shape matching task using mah-jong tiles with no visual input. furthermore, seven out of eight experts performed a tactile shape matching task with unfamiliar 2d braille characters.


RESULTS
when participants performed tactile discrimination of mah-jong tiles, the left lateral occipital cortex  and v <dig> were activated in the well-trained subjects. in the naïve subjects, the lo was activated but v <dig> was not activated. both the lo and v <dig> of the well-trained subjects were activated during braille tactile discrimination tasks.


CONCLUSIONS
the activation of v <dig> in subjects trained in tactile discrimination may represent altered cross-modal responses as a result of long-term training.
