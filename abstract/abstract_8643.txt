BACKGROUND
bacteria from the genus borrelia are known to harbor numerous linear and circular plasmids. we report here a comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequences of  <dig> plasmids present in fourteen independent isolates of the lyme disease agent b. burgdorferi.


RESULTS
we have sequenced the genomes of  <dig> b. burgdorferi sensu stricto isolates that carry a total of  <dig> plasmids. these individual isolates carry between seven and  <dig> plasmids. their chromosomes, the cp <dig> and cp <dig> circular plasmids, as well as the lp <dig> linear plasmid, are quite evolutionarily stable; however, the remaining plasmids have undergone numerous non-homologous and often duplicative recombination events. we identify  <dig> different putative plasmid compatibility types among the  <dig> plasmids, of which  <dig> are  circular and  <dig> are linear. because of past rearrangements, any given gene, even though it might be universally present in these isolates, is often found on different linear plasmid compatibility types in different isolates. for example, the arp gene and the vls cassette region are present on plasmids of four and five different compatibility types, respectively, in different isolates. a majority of the plasmid types have more than one organizationally different subtype, and the number of such variants ranges from one to eight among the  <dig> linear plasmid types. in spite of this substantial organizational diversity, the plasmids are not so variable that every isolate has a novel version of every plasmid .


CONCLUSIONS
although there have been many past recombination events, both homologous and nonhomologous, among the plasmids, particular organizational variants of these plasmids correlate with particular chromosomal genotypes, suggesting that there has not been rapid horizontal transfer of whole linear plasmids among b. burgdorferi lineages. we argue that plasmid rearrangements are essentially non-revertable and are present at a frequency of only about  <dig> % that of single nucleotide changes, making rearrangement-derived novel junctions  ideal phylogenetic markers in the study of b. burgdorferi population structure and plasmid evolution and exchange.
