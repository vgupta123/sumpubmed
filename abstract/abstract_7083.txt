BACKGROUND
to have an insight into the mayetiola destructor  genome, we performed an in silico comparative genomic analysis utilizing genetic mapping, genomic sequence and est sequence data along with data available from public databases.


RESULTS
chromosome walking and fish were utilized to identify a contig of  <dig> bac clones near the telomere of the short arm of hessian fly chromosome x <dig> and near the avirulence gene vh <dig>  these clones enabled us to correlate physical and genetic distance in this region of the hessian fly genome. sequence data from these bac ends encompassing a  <dig> kb region, and a fully sequenced and assembled  <dig>  kb bac clone, was utilized to perform a comparative genomic study. in silico gene prediction combined with blast analyses was used to determine putative orthology to the sequenced dipteran genomes of the fruit fly, drosophila melanogaster, and the malaria mosquito, anopheles gambiae, and to infer evolutionary relationships.


CONCLUSIONS
this initial effort enables us to advance our understanding of the structure, composition and evolution of the genome of this important agricultural pest and is an invaluable tool for a whole genome sequencing effort.
