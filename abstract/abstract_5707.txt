BACKGROUND
viruses are among the most destructive and difficult to control plant pathogens. melon  has become the model species for the agriculturally important cucurbitaceae family. approaches that take advantage of recently developed genomic tools in melon have been extremely useful for understanding viral pathogenesis and can contribute to the identification of target genes for breeding new resistant cultivars. in this work, we have used a recently described melon microarray for transcriptome profiling of two melon cultivars infected with two strains of melon necrotic spot virus  that only differ on their 3′-untranslated regions.


RESULTS
melon plant tissues from the cultivars tendral or planters jumbo were locally infected with either mnsv-mα <dig> or mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> and analysed in a time-course experiment. principal component and hierarchical clustering analyses identified treatment  and sampling date  as the primary and secondary variables, respectively. out of  <dig> and  <dig> genes deregulated by mnsv-mα <dig> and mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were strain-specific. likewise, mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> specifically deregulated  <dig> and  <dig> genes in tendral and planters jumbo, respectively. the go categories that were significantly affected were clearly different for the different virus/host combinations. grouping genes according to their patterns of expression allowed for the identification of two groups that were specifically deregulated by mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> with respect to mnsv-mα <dig> in tendral, and one group that was antagonistically regulated in planters jumbo vs. tendral after mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> infection. genes in these three groups belonged to diverse functional classes, and no obvious regulatory commonalities were identified. when data on mnsv-mα5/tendral infections were compared to equivalent data on cucumber mosaic virus or watermelon mosaic virus infections, cytokinin-o-glucosyltransferase <dig> was identified as the only gene that was deregulated by all three viruses, with infection dynamics correlating with the amplitude of transcriptome remodeling.


CONCLUSIONS
strain-specific changes, as well as cultivar-specific changes, were identified by profiling the transcriptomes of plants from two melon cultivars infected with two mnsv strains. no obvious regulatory features shared among deregulated genes have been identified, pointing toward regulation through differential functional pathways.
