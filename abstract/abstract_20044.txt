BACKGROUND
the anopheles gambiae salivary glands play a major role in malaria transmission and express a variety of bioactive components that facilitate blood-feeding by preventing platelet aggregation, blood clotting, vasodilatation, and inflammatory and other reactions at the probing site on the vertebrate host.


RESULTS
we have performed a global transcriptome analysis of the a. gambiae salivary gland response to blood-feeding, to identify candidate genes that are involved in hematophagy. a total of  <dig>  genes were found to be transcribed in this tissue. a comparison of salivary gland transcriptomes prior to and after blood-feeding identified  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts that were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. ten genes were further selected to assess their role in the blood-feeding process using rnai-mediated gene silencing methodology. depletion of the salivary gland genes encoding d7l <dig>  anophelin, peroxidase, the sg <dig> precursor, and a 5'nucleotidase gene significantly increased probing time of a. gambiae mosquitoes and thereby their capacity to blood-feed.


CONCLUSIONS
the salivary gland transcriptome comprises approximately 38% of the total mosquito transcriptome and a small proportion of it is dynamically changing already at two hours in response to blood feeding. a better understanding of the salivary gland transcriptome and its function can contribute to the development of pathogen transmission control strategies and the identification of medically relevant bioactive compounds.
