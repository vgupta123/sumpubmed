BACKGROUND
Î±-enolase  is a key glycolytic enzyme implicated in the development of many human cancers including breast cancer. increased expression of eno <dig> has recently been reported in estrogen -positive human breast cancer patients. the present study examined the expression of eno <dig> and assessed its significance in canine mammary carcinoma.


RESULTS
immunohistochemical staining was employed to investigate the expression of eno <dig> in  <dig> cases of canine mammary tumor . quantification of immunohistochemistry was carried out using quick score and the results showed cytoplasmic eno <dig> overexpression in  <dig> of the  <dig> carcinomas . overexpression of eno <dig> correlated significantly with shorter cause-specific survival , but was not associated with er positivity in canine mammary carcinoma.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that overexpression of eno <dig> may be used as a prognostic marker for poor outcome in canine mammary carcinoma.
