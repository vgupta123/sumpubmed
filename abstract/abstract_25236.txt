BACKGROUND
the t translocation is found in  <dig> to 25% of cases of childhood b-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia . this rearrangement results in the fusion of etv <dig>  and runx <dig>  genes and defines a relatively uniform category, although only some patients suffer very late relapse. tel/aml1-positive patients are thus an interesting subgroup to study, and such studies should elucidate the biological processes underlying tel/aml <dig> pathogenesis. we report an analysis of gene expression in  <dig> children with b-lineage all using agilent whole genome oligo-chips  and/or real time rt-pcr.


RESULTS
we compared the leukemia cell gene expression profiles of  <dig> tel/aml1-positive all patients to those of  <dig> tel/aml1-negative patients, whose blast cells did not contain any additional recurrent translocation. microarray analyses of  <dig> samples allowed the identification of genes differentially expressed between the tel/aml1-positive and negative all groups. gene enrichment analysis defined five enriched go categories: cell differentiation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell motility and response to wounding, associated with  <dig> genes -runx <dig>  tcfl <dig>  tnfrsf <dig>  cbfa2t <dig>  cd <dig>  scarb <dig>  tp53inp <dig>  acvr1c, pik3c <dig>  egfl <dig>  sema6a, ctgf, lsp <dig>  tfpi â€“ highlighting the biology of the tel/aml <dig> sub-group. these results were first confirmed by the analysis of an additional microarray data-set  and second by real-time rt-pcr quantification and clustering using an independent set . over-expression of runx <dig>  was further investigated and in one third of the patients correlated with cytogenetic findings.


CONCLUSIONS
gene expression analyses of leukemia cells from  <dig> children with tel/aml1-positive and -negative b-lineage all led to the identification of five biological processes, associated with  <dig> validated genes characterizing and highlighting the biology of the tel/aml1-positive all sub-group.
