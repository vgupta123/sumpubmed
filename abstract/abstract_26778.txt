BACKGROUND
vibrio parahaemolyticus is an aquatic, halophilic, gram-negative bacterium, first discovered in  <dig> in japan during a food-poisoning outbreak. infections resulting from consumption of v. parahaemolyticus have increased globally in the last  <dig> years leading to the bacterium's classification as a newly emerging pathogen. in  <dig> the first appearance of a pandemic v. parahaemolyticus clone occurred, a new o3:k <dig> serotype strain that has now been identified worldwide as a major cause of seafood-borne gastroenteritis.


RESULTS
we examined the sequenced genome of v. parahaemolyticus rimd <dig>  an o3:k <dig> serotype strain isolated in japan in  <dig>  by bioinformatic analyses to uncover genomic islands  that may play a role in the emergence and pathogenesis of pandemic strains. we identified  <dig> regions ranging in size from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb that had the characteristics of gis such as aberrant base composition compared to the core genome, presence of phage-like integrases, flanked by direct repeats and the absence of these regions from closely related species. molecular analysis of worldwide clinical isolates of v. parahaemolyticus recovered over the last  <dig> years demonstrated that a  <dig> kb region named v. parahaemolyticus island- <dig>  encompassing orfs vp <dig> to vp <dig> is only present in new o3:k <dig> and related strains recovered after  <dig>  we investigated the presence of  <dig> additional regions, vpai- <dig> , vpai- <dig>  and vpai- <dig>  by pcr assays and southern blot analyses among the same set of v. parahaemolyticus isolates. these  <dig> vpai regions also gave similar distribution patterns amongst the  <dig> strains examined.


CONCLUSIONS
the  <dig> vpai regions examined may represent dna acquired by the pandemic group of v. parahaemolyticus isolates that increased their fitness either in the aquatic environment or in their ability to infect humans.
