BACKGROUND
immune thrombocytopenia  in dogs is analogous to that in humans. romiplostim, a novel thrombopoietin receptor  agonist, is currently used for the treatment of refractory itp in humans, but not in dogs. here, we describe the response to romiplostim in five dogs with refractory itp. five dogs with severe and refractory itp  received romiplostim subcutaneously. four dogs were administered 3–5 μg/kg and one dog received 10–13 μg/kg body weight once weekly.


RESULTS
romiplostim was well-tolerated and administration was associated with an increase in platelet counts in all five dogs. four of the five dogs entered remission and relapses were not observed over a follow-up period of 3– <dig> months.


CONCLUSIONS
romiplostim is effective in the treatment of itp in dogs at least as well as in humans. this finding may help to develop and use new therapeutics for itp in dogs and humans.
