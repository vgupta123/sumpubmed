BACKGROUND
predicting the subcellular localization of proteins is important for determining the function of proteins. previous works focused on predicting protein localization in gram-negative bacteria obtained good results. however, these methods had relatively low accuracies for the localization of extracellular proteins. this paper studies ways to improve the accuracy for predicting extracellular localization in gram-negative bacteria.


RESULTS
we have developed a system for predicting the subcellular localization of proteins for gram-negative bacteria based on amino acid subalphabets and a combination of multiple support vector machines. the recall of the extracellular site and overall recall of our predictor reach  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, in 5-fold cross-validation. to the best of our knowledge, these are the most accurate results for predicting subcellular localization in gram-negative bacteria.


CONCLUSIONS
clustering  <dig> amino acids into a few groups by the proposed greedy algorithm provides a new way to extract features from protein sequences to cover more adjacent amino acids and hence reduce the dimensionality of the input vector of protein features. it was observed that a good amino acid grouping leads to an increase in prediction performance. furthermore, a proper choice of a subset of complementary support vector machines constructed by different features of proteins maximizes the prediction accuracy.
