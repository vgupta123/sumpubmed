BACKGROUND
powdery mildew  is the most common fungal disease of cucumber and other cucurbit crops, while breeding the pm-resistant materials is the effective way to defense this disease, and the recent development of modern genetics and genomics make us aware of that studying the resistance genes is the essential way to breed the pm high-resistance plant. with the ever increasing throughput of next-generation sequencing , the development of specific length amplified fragment sequencing  as a high-resolution strategy for large-scale de novo snp discovery is gradually applied for functional gene mining. here we combined the bulked segregant analysis  with slaf-seq to identify candidate genes associated with pm resistance in cucumber.

methods
a segregating population comprising 251 f2 individuals was developed using h <dig>  as susceptible parent and bk <dig>  as resistance donor. after pmr test, total genomic dna was prepared from each plant. systemic genomic analysis of the gc content, repeat sequence, etc. was carried out by prediction software slaf_predict to establish condition to ensure the uniformity and density of the molecular markers. after samples were gel purified, slafs were generated at biomarker technologies corporation in beijing. based on slaf tags and the pmr test result, the hot region were annotated.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  high-quality slaf tags with an average depth of  <dig> × were sequenced. among these,  <dig>  polymorphic tags were identified with a polymorphism rate of  <dig>  %, including  <dig>  % snps and other polymorphism types. finally,  <dig> associated slafs were identified, and two main hot regions were detected on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  which contained five genes invovled in defense response, toxin metabolism, cell stress response, and injury response in cucumber.


CONCLUSIONS
associated markers identified by super-bsa in this study, could not only speed up the study of the pmr genes, but also provide a feasible solution for breeding the marker-assisted pmr cucumber. moreover, this study could also be extended to any other species with reference genome.
