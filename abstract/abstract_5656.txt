BACKGROUND
human endogenous retroviruses  have received much attention for their implications in the etiology of many human diseases and their profound effect on evolution. notably, recent studies have highlighted associations between hervs expression and cancers , autoimmunity  and neurological  conditions. their repetitive nature makes their study particularly challenging, where expression studies have largely focused on individual loci  or general trends within families .

methods
to refine our understanding of hervs activity, we introduce here a new microarray, herv-v <dig>  this work was made possible by the careful detection and annotation of genomic herv/malr sequences as well as the development of a new hybridization model, allowing the optimization of probe performances and the control of cross-reactions.﻿﻿﻿


RESULTS
herv-v <dig> offers an almost complete coverage of hervs and their ancestors  at the locus level along with four other repertoires . we demonstrate that herv-v <dig> analytical performances are comparable with commercial affymetrix arrays, and that for a selection of tissue/pathological specific loci, the patterns of expression measured on herv-v <dig> is consistent with those reported in the literature.


CONCLUSIONS
given its large hervs/malrs coverage and additional repertoires, herv-v <dig> opens the door to multiple applications such as enhancers and alternative promoters identification, biomarkers identification as well as the characterization of genes and hervs/malrs modulation caused by viral infection.
