BACKGROUND
positions of spliceosomal introns are often conserved between remotely related genes. introns that reside in non-conserved positions are either novel or remnants of frequent losses of introns in some evolutionary lineages. a recent gain of such introns is difficult to prove. however, introns verified as novel are needed to evaluate contemporary processes of intron gain.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> unambiguous cases of novel intron positions in  <dig> drosophila genes that exhibit near intron pairs . here, a nip consists of an ancient and a novel intron position that are separated by less than  <dig> nt. within a single gene, such closely-spaced introns are very unlikely to have coexisted. in most cases, therefore, the ancient intron position must have disappeared in favour of the novel one. a survey for nips among  <dig> drosophila genomes identifies intron sliding  as one of the more frequent causes of novel intron positions. other novel introns seem to have been gained by regional tandem duplications of coding sequences containing a proto-splice site.


CONCLUSIONS
recent intron gains sometimes appear to have arisen by duplication of exonic sequences and subsequent intronization of one of the copies. intron migration and exon duplication together may account for a significant amount of novel intron positions in conserved coding sequences.
