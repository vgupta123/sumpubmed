BACKGROUND
using a gene clustering strategy we determined intracellular pathway relationships within skeletal myotubes in response to an acute heat stress stimuli. following heat shock, the transcriptome was analyzed by microarray in a temporal fashion to characterize the dynamic relationship of signaling pathways.


RESULTS
bioinformatics analyses exposed coordination of functionally-related gene sets, depicting mechanism-based responses to heat shock. protein turnover-related pathways were significantly affected including protein folding, pre-mrna processing, mrna splicing, proteolysis and proteasome-related pathways. many responses were transient, tending to normalize within  <dig> hours.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we show that the transcriptional response to acute cell stress is largely transient and proteosome-centric.
