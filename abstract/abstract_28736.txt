BACKGROUND
the magnitude of multimodal enhancement in the brain is believed to depend on the stimulus intensity and timing. such an effect has been found in many species, but has not been previously investigated in insects.


RESULTS
we investigated the responses to multimodal stimuli consisting of an odour and a colour in the antennal lobe and mushroom body of the moth manduca sexta. the mushroom body shows enhanced responses for multimodal stimuli consisting of a general flower odour and a blue colour. no such effect was seen for a bergamot odour. the enhancement shows an inverse effectiveness where the responses to weaker multimodal stimuli are amplified more than those to stronger stimuli. furthermore, the enhancement depends on the precise timing of the two stimulus components.


CONCLUSIONS
insect multimodal processing show both the principle of inverse effectiveness and the existence of an optimal temporal window.
