BACKGROUND
based on binding of invariant chain  to major histocompatibility complex  class ii molecules to form complexes, ii-segment hybrids, ii-key structure linking an epitope, or ii class ii-associated invariant chain peptide  replaced with an epitope were used to increase immune response. it is currently unknown whether the ii-segment cytosolic and transmembrane domains bind to the mhc non-peptide binding region  and consequently influence immune response. to investigate the potential role of ii-segments in the immune response via mhc ii/peptide complexes, a few hybrids containing ii-segments and a multiepitope  from newcastle disease virus fusion protein  were constructed, and their binding effects on mhc ii molecules and specific antibody production were compared using confocal microscopy, immunoprecipitation, western blotting and animal experiments.


RESULTS
one of the ii-segment/f <dig> hybrids, containing nd  outside the f <dig> in the ii-key structure , neither co-localized with mhc ii molecules on plasma membrane nor bound to mhc ii molecules to form complexes. however, stimulation of mice with the structure produced 4-fold higher antibody titers compared with f <dig> alone. the two other ii-segment/f <dig> hybrids, in which the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of ii were linked to this structure , partially co-localized on plasma membrane with mhc class ii molecules and weakly bound mhc ii molecules to form complexes. they induced mice to produce approximately 9-fold higher antibody titers compared with f <dig> alone. furthermore, an ii/f <dig> hybrid  co-localized well with mhc ii molecules on the membrane to form complexes, although it increased antibody titer about 3-fold relative to f <dig> alone.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that ii-segments improve specific immune response by binding to the non-pbr on mhc class ii molecules and enabling membrane co-localization with mhc ii molecules, resulting in the formation of relatively stable mhc ii/peptide complexes on the plasma membrane, and signal transduction.
