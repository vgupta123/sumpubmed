BACKGROUND
the cuticle is an important adaptive structure whose origin played a crucial role in the transition of plants from aqueous to terrestrial conditions. hvabcg31/eibi <dig> is an abcg transporter gene, involved in cuticle formation that was recently identified in wild barley . to study the genetic variation of hvabcg <dig> in different habitats, its  <dig> kb promoter region was sequenced from  <dig> wild barley accessions collected from five natural populations from southern and northern israel. the sites included three mesic and two xeric habitats, and differed in annual rainfall, soil type, and soil water capacity.


RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis of the aligned hvabcg <dig> promoter sequences clustered the majority of accessions  from the three northern mesic populations into one cluster, while all  <dig> accessions from the dead sea area, a xeric southern population, and two isolated accessions  formed the second cluster. the southern arid populations included six haplotypes, but they differed from the consensus sequence at a large number of positions, while the northern mesic populations included  <dig> haplotypes that were, on average, more similar to the consensus sequence. most of the haplotypes  were unique to a population. interestingly, higher genetic variation occurred within populations  than among populations . analysis of the promoter region detected a large number of transcription factor binding sites: 121– <dig> and 121– <dig> sites in the two southern arid populations, and 123– <dig> – <dig>  and 123– <dig> sites in the three northern mesic populations. three types of tfbss were significantly enriched: those related to ga , dof , and light.


CONCLUSIONS
drought stress and adaptive natural selection may have been important determinants in the observed sequence variation of hvabcg <dig> promoter. abiotic stresses may be involved in the hvabcg <dig> gene transcription regulations, generating more protective cuticles in plants under stresses.
