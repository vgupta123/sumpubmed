BACKGROUND
in august  <dig> a major epidemic of bluetongue virus serotype  <dig>  started off in north-west europe. in the course of  <dig> it became evident that btv <dig> had survived the winter in north-west europe, re-emerged and spread exponentially. recently, the european union decided to start vaccination against btv <dig>  in order to improve the understanding of the epidemiological situation, it was necessary to execute a cross-sectional serological study at the end of the bt vector season. cattle were the target species for cross-sectional serological studies in europe at the end of  <dig> and  <dig>  however, there was no information on the btv8-seroprevalence in sheep and goats.


RESULTS
on the basis of our cross-sectional study, the estimated seroprevalence of btv8-exposed locations in the netherlands in  <dig> was 0% for goats  and  <dig> % for sheep . the estimated seroprevalence of btv- <dig> exposed locations in  <dig> was 47% for goats  and 70% for sheep . there was a wide range in within-location seroprevalence in locations with goats and sheep . a gradient in seroprevalence was seen, with the highest level of seroprevalence in the southern netherlands, the area where the epidemic started in  <dig>  and a decreasing seroprevalence when going in a northern direction.


CONCLUSIONS
there is a much higher estimated seroprevalence of locations with goats exposed to btv <dig> than can be inferred from the rather low number of reported clinical outbreaks in goats. this is probably due to the fact that clinical signs in infected goats are far less obvious than in sheep. the wide range in within-location seroprevalence observed means that the proportion of animals protected in  <dig> by a natural infection in  <dig> and/or  <dig> can differ highly between flocks. this should be taken into account when vaccinating animals.
