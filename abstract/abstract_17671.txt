BACKGROUND
work on protein structure prediction is very useful in biological research. to evaluate their accuracy, experimental protein structures or their derived data are used as the 'gold standard'. however, as proteins are dynamic molecular machines with structural flexibility such a standard may be unreliable.


RESULTS
to investigate the influence of the structure flexibility, we analysed  <dig>  protein structures of  <dig> unique sequences from  <dig> protein families. the results showed that  the three-dimensional  protein structures were not rigid: the root-mean-square deviation  of the backbone cα of structures with identical sequences was relatively large, with the average of the maximum rmsd from each of the  <dig> sequences being  <dig>  Å;  the derived data of the 3d structure was not constant, e.g. the highest ratio of the secondary structure wobble site was  <dig> %, with the sequence alignments from structural comparisons of two proteins in the same family sometimes being completely different.


CONCLUSIONS
proteins may have several stable conformations and the data derived from resolved structures as a 'gold standard' should be optimized before being utilized as criteria to evaluate the prediction methods, e.g. sequence alignment from structural comparison. helix/β-sheet transition exists in normal free proteins. the coil ratio of the 3d structure could affect its resolution as determined by x-ray crystallography.
