BACKGROUND
the production of transgenic plants, either for the overproduction of the protein of interest, for promoter: reporter lines, or for the downregulation of genes is an important prerequisite in modern plant research but is also very time-consuming.


RESULTS
we have produced additions to the ppzp family of vectors. vector ppzp <dig>  is devoid of noti sites and vector ppzp <dig>  contains a bacterial kanamycin resistance gene. vector pmaa-red contains a pdf <dig> : dsred marker and a camv:: gus cassette within the t-dna and is useful for the production of promoter: gus lines and overexpression lines. the pdf <dig>  promoter is expressed in seeds and syncytia induced by the beet cyst nematode heterodera schachti in arabidopsis roots. transgenic seeds show red fluorescence which can be used for selection and the fluorescence level is indicative of the expression level of the transgene. the advantage is that plants can be grown on soil and that expression of the marker can be directly screened at the seed stage which saves time and resources. due to the expression of the pdf <dig> : dsred marker in syncytia, the vector is especially useful for the expression of a gene of interest in syncytia.


CONCLUSIONS
the vector pmaa-red allows for fast and easy production of transgenic arabidopsis plants with a strong expression level of the gene of interest.
