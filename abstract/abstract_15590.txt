BACKGROUND
the most renowned biological ontology, gene ontology  is widely used for annotations of genes and gene products of different organisms. however, there are shortcomings in the resource description framework  data file provided by the go consortium: 1) lack of sufficient semantic relationships between pairs of terms coming from the three independent go sub-ontologies, that limit the power to provide complex semantic queries and inference services based on it. 2) the term-centric view of go annotation data and the fact that all information is stored in a single file. this makes attempts to retrieve go annotations based on big volume datasets unmanageable. 3) no support of goslim.


RESULTS
we propose a rdf model, gorouter, which encodes heterogeneous original data in a uniform rdf format, creates additional ontology mappings between go terms, and introduces a set of inference rulebases. furthermore, we use the oracle network data model  as the native rdf data repository and the table function rdf_match to seamlessly combine the result of rdf queries with traditional relational data. as a result, the scale of gorouter is minimized; information not directly involved in semantic inference is put into relational tables.


CONCLUSIONS
our work demonstrates how to use multiple semantic web tools and techniques to provide a mixture of semantic query and inference solutions of go and its associations. gorouter is licensed under apache license version  <dig> , and is accessible via the website: .
