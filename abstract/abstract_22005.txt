BACKGROUND
there is an urgent need of neuronal cell models to be applied to high-throughput screening settings while recapitulating physiological and/or pathological events occurring in the central nervous system . stem cells offer a great opportunity in this direction since their self renewal capacity allows for large scale expansion. protocols for directed differentiation also promise to generate populations of biochemically homogenous neuronal progenies. ns  cells are a novel population of stem cells that undergo symmetric cell division in monolayer and chemically defined media, while remaining highly neurogenic.


RESULTS
we report the full adaptation of the ns cell systems for their growth and neuronal differentiation to 96- and 384-well microplates. this optimized system has also been exploited in homogeneous and high-content assays.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that these mouse ns cells may be suitable for a series of applications in high-throughput format.
