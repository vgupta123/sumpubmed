BACKGROUND
some microorganisms can produce pigments such as melanin, which has been associated with virulence in the host and with a survival advantage in the environment. in vibrio cholerae, studies have shown that pigment-producing mutants are more virulent than the parental strain in terms of increased uv resistance, production of major virulence factors, and colonization. to date, almost all of the pigmented v. cholerae strains investigated have been induced by chemicals, culture stress, or transposon mutagenesis. however, during our cholera surveillance, some nontoxigenic serogroup o <dig> strains and one toxigenic o <dig> strain, which can produce pigment steadily under the commonly used experimental growth conditions, were obtained in different years and from different areas. the genes vc <dig> to vc <dig>  which correspond to the el tor strain n <dig> genome and which comprise an operon in the tyrosine catabolic pathway, have been confirmed to be associated with a pigmented phenotype. in the present study, we investigated the mechanism of pigment production in these strains.


RESULTS
sequencing of the vc <dig>  vc <dig>  vc <dig>  and vc <dig> genes in these pigmented strains suggested that a deletion mutation in the homogentisate oxygenase gene  may be associated with the pigmented phenotype, and gene complementation confirmed the role of this gene in pigment production. an identical 15-bp deletion was found in the vc <dig> gene of all six o <dig> pigment-producing strains examined, and a 10-bp deletion was found in the vc <dig> gene of the o <dig> strain. strict sequence conservation in the vc <dig> gene but higher variance in the other three genes of this operon were observed, indicating the different stress response functions of these genes in environmental adaption and selection. on the basis of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing, the pigment-producing o <dig> strains showed high clonality, even though they were isolated in different years and from different regions. additionally all these o <dig> strains belong to the rb <dig> ribotype, which contains the o <dig> strains isolated from diarrheal patients, although these strains are cholera toxin negative.


CONCLUSIONS
dysfunction of homogentisate oxygenase  causes homogentisate accumulation and pigment formation in naturally pigmented strains of v. cholerae. the high clonality of these strains may correlate to an environmental survival advantage in the v. cholerae community due to their pigment production, and may imply a potential protective function of melanin in environmental survival of such strains.
