BACKGROUND
the objective of the current study was to develop a stochastic agent-based model using empirical data from ontario  swine sites in order to evaluate different surveillance strategies for detection of emerging porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  strains at the regional level. four strategies were evaluated, including  random sampling of fixed numbers of swine sites monthly;  risk-based sampling of fixed numbers, specifically of breeding sites ;  risk-based sampling of fixed numbers of low biosecurity sites ; and  risk-based sampling of breeding sites that are characterized as low biosecurity sites . the model simulated transmission of a hypothetical emerging prrsv strain between swine sites through three important industry networks  while considering sites’ underlying immunity due to past or recent exposure to heterologous prrsv strains, as well as demographic, geographic and biosecurity-related prrs risk factors. outcomes of interest included surveillance system sensitivity and time to detection of the three first cases over a period of approximately three years.


RESULTS
surveillance system sensitivities were low and time to detection of three first cases was long across all examined scenarios.


CONCLUSIONS
traditional modes of implementing high-risk and high-consequence risk-based surveillance based on site’s static characteristics do not appear to substantially improve surveillance system sensitivity. novel strategies need to be developed and considered for rapid detection of this and other emerging swine infectious diseases. none of the four strategies compared herein appeared optimal for early detection of an emerging pprsv strain at the regional level considering model assumptions, the underlying population of interest, and absence of other forms of surveillance.
