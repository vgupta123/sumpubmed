BACKGROUND
investigating the host response in the early stage of influenza a virus  infection is of considerable interest. however, it is conceivable that effects due to the anesthesia and/or intranasal infection procedure might introduce artifacts. we therefore aimed to evaluate the effects of anesthesia and/or intranasal infection on transcription of selected pulmonary mrnas in two inbred mouse strains with differential susceptibility to iav infection.


RESULTS
dba/2j and c57bl/6j mice were evaluated in a time course experiment in which lung tissue was sampled after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 120 h. after anesthesia with ketamine and xylazine, a suspension of mouse-adapted iav strain pr8_mun in 20 μl sterile buffer, or 20 μl sterile buffer only, was instilled intranasally. the mice receiving anesthesia and pbs only were designated the “mock treatment” group. pulmonary expression of  <dig> host mrnas  and viral hemagglutinin  mrna were determined at the designated time points. as expected, weight loss and viral replication were greater in the dba/2j strain . four mrnas  were procedure-dependently regulated in dba/2j mice between  <dig> and 24 h, and two  in c57bl/6j mice, although to a lesser extent. all  <dig> mrnas rose after infection, but one  only in dba/2j mice. these infection-dependent effects could be separated from procedure-dependent effects beginning around 12 h in dba/2j and 18 h in c57bl/6j mice. the interferon-related mrnas stat <dig>  ifng, infl <dig>  and mx <dig> were unaffected by mock treatment in either mouse strain. mx <dig> and infl <dig> correlated best with ha mrna expression .


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate effects of the anesthesia and/or intranasal infection procedure on pulmonary gene expression, which are detectable between approximately  <dig> and 24 h post procedure and vary in intensity and temporal evolution depending on the mouse strain used. mock infection controls should be included in all studies on pulmonary gene expression in the early phase of infection with iav and, likely, other respiratory pathogens.
