BACKGROUND
the microbiological procedures for cystic fibrosis  samples of  <dig> participating spanish centers were examined to verify their compliance with current international and national guidelines and to implement the best standards of care for microbiology practices. a 47-item questionnaire covering different cf microbiology aspects was sent to participant laboratories. telephone interviews were performed when necessary. data about samples processing for bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi were collected.


RESULTS
gene sequencing , maldi-tof  or both  were available for most laboratories. susceptibility testing was performed by automated microdilution systems  and manual diffusion methods . however, a low use of selective media for staphylococcus aureus  and burkholderia cepacia complex , and of epidemiological typing methods  was reported.


CONCLUSIONS
most spanish laboratories are in agreement with consensus guidelines for the processing of cf respiratory samples, but need to improve in the use of specific selective media and typing methods for epidemiologic studies.
