BACKGROUND
phic <dig> integrase facilitates efficient integration of transgenes into human and mouse genomes and is considered for clinical gene therapy. however recent studies have shown that the enzyme can induce various chromosomal abnormalities in primary human embryonic cells and mammalian cell lines. the mechanisms involved are unknown, but it has been proposed that phic <dig> attachment sites in the host genome recombine leading to chromosomal translocations.


RESULTS
we have studied possible effects of the phic <dig> integrase expression in human adult fibroblasts by karyotyping. all control cells were cytogenetically normal, whereas cells expressing phic <dig> integrase show chromosomal abnormalities confirming our previous results using primary embryonic fibroblasts. in order to study the early mechanisms involved we measured h2ax phosphorylation â€“ a primary event in the response to dna double-strand-breaks. transient transfection with phic <dig> integrase encoding plasmids lead to an elevated number of cells positive for h2ax phosphorylation detected by immunofluorescence. western blot analysis confirmed the upregulated h2ax phosphorylation, whereas markers for apoptosis as well as p <dig> and p <dig> were not induced. cells transfected with plasmids encoding the sleeping beauty transposase remained cytogenetically normal, and in these cells less upregulation of h2ax phosphorylation could be detected.


CONCLUSIONS
in primary human fibroblasts expression of phic <dig> integrase leads to a dna damage response and chromosomal aberrations.
