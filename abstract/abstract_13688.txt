BACKGROUND
sinorhizobium meliloti is an agriculturally important model symbiont. there is an ongoing need to update and improve its genome annotation. in this study, we used a high-throughput pyrosequencing approach to sequence the transcriptome of s. meliloti, and search for new bacterial genes missed in the previous genome annotation. this is the first report of sequencing a bacterial transcriptome using the pyrosequencing technology.


RESULTS
our pilot sequencing run generated  <dig>  reads with an average length of  <dig> nucleotides per read. from these data, we identified  <dig> new genes. these new gene transcripts were confirmed by rt-pcr and their possible functions were analyzed.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that high-throughput sequence analysis of bacterial transcriptomes is feasible and next-generation sequencing technologies will greatly facilitate the discovery of new genes and improve genome annotation.
