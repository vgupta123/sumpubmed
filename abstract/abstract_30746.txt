BACKGROUND
susceptibility or resistance to infection with listeria monocytogenes correlates with selenium  deficiency in response to infection.


RESULTS
se-deficient mouse models of listeriosis were used to study the innate immune response during the course of l. monocytogenes infection. blood samples from mouse models were used for se status. the concentration of mda, sod, gpx and cat in blood has revealed that lower se level exist in se-deficient mice. intestine, mesenteric lymph node, liver, spleen and brain from each mouse were to study the bacterial burden in organs. the analysis of cell types of spleen from se-deficient mice revealed that the ability of the host to elicit a rapid recruitment and activation of systemic innate immune response to infection was to a certain extent compromised under conditions of se deficiency. the cytokine levels in the serum and cytokine expression levels in the livers from se-deficient mice revealed that the innate immune response of se-deficient mice was impaired throughout the course of infection. these results suggest that innate immune response is altered by se deficiency after infection with l. monocytogenes.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, induced susceptibility of host resistance is associated with an impaired innate immune response following infection with l. monocytogenes in c57bl/ <dig> se-deficient mice.
