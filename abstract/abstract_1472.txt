BACKGROUND
an initial comparative genomic study of the malaria vector anopheles gambiae and the yellow fever mosquito aedes aegypti revealed striking differences in the genome assembly size and in the abundance of transposable elements between the two species. however, the chromosome arms homology between an. gambiae and ae. aegypti, as well as the distribution of genes and repetitive elements in chromosomes of ae. aegypti, remained largely unexplored because of the lack of a detailed physical genome map for the yellow fever mosquito.


RESULTS
using a molecular landmark-guided fluorescent in situ hybridization approach, we mapped 624Â mb of the ae. aegypti genome to mitotic chromosomes. we used this map to analyze the distribution of genes, tandem repeats and transposable elements along the chromosomes and to explore the patterns of chromosome homology and rearrangements between ae. aegypti and an. gambiae. the study demonstrated that the q arm of the sex-determining chromosome  <dig> had the lowest gene content and the highest density of minisatellites. a comparative genomic analysis with an. gambiae determined that the previously proposed whole-arm synteny is not fully preserved; a number of pericentric inversions have occurred between the two species. the sex-determining chromosome  <dig> had a higher rate of genome rearrangements than observed in autosomes  <dig> and  <dig> of ae. aegypti.


CONCLUSIONS
the study developed a physical map of 45% of the ae. aegypti genome and provided new insights into genomic composition and evolution of ae. aegypti chromosomes. our data suggest that minisatellites rather than transposable elements played a major role in rapid evolution of chromosome  <dig> in the aedes lineage. the research tools and information generated by this study contribute to a more complete understanding of the genome organization and evolution in mosquitoes.
