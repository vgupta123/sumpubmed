BACKGROUND
bacteriophage Φ <dig> is a member of the cystoviridae and is distinct from Φ <dig>  the first member of that family. we have recently isolated a number of related phages and five showed high similarity to Φ <dig> in the amino acid sequences of several proteins. bacteriophage Φ <dig> is a member of this group.


RESULTS
Φ <dig> was isolated from radish leaves and was found to have a genome of three segments of double-stranded rna , placing it in the cystoviridae. the base sequences for many of the genes and for the segment termini were similar but not identical to those of bacteriophage Φ <dig>  however, the host specificity was for the type iv pili of pseudomonas syringae hb10y rather than for the rough lps to which Φ <dig> attaches. reverse genetics techniques enabled the production of infectious phage from cdna copies of the genome. phage were constructed with one, two or three genomic segments. phage were also produced with altered transcriptional regulation. although the pac sequences of Φ <dig> show no similarity to those of Φ <dig>  segment m of Φ <dig> could be acquired by Φ <dig> resulting in a change of host specificity.


CONCLUSIONS
we have isolated a new member of the bacteriophage family cystoviridae and find that although it shows similarity to other members of the family, it has unique properties that help to elucidate viral strategies for genomic packaging and gene expression.
