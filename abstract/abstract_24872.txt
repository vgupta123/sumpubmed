BACKGROUND
the arthropods are a diverse group of organisms including chelicerata , crustacea , and insecta . the cattle tick, rhipicephalus  microplus, is an economically significant ectoparasite of cattle affecting cattle industries world wide. with the availability of sequence reads from the first chelicerate genome project  and extensive r. microplus ests, we investigated evidence for putative rnai proteins and studied rna interference in tick cell cultures and adult female ticks targeting drosophila homologues with known cell viability phenotype.


RESULTS
we screened  <dig>  r. microplus ests and i. scapularis genome reads to identify rnai related proteins in ticks. our analysis identified  <dig> rnai proteins including a putative tick dicer, risc associated , rna dependent rna polymerase  and  <dig> homologues implicated in dsrna uptake and processing. we selected  <dig> r. microplus ests with >80% similarity to d. melanogaster proteins associated with cell viability for rnai functional screens in both bme <dig> r. microplus embryonic cells and female ticks in vivo. only genes associated with proteasomes had an effect on cell viability in vitro. in vivo rnai showed that  <dig> genes had significant effects either causing lethality or impairing egg laying.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified key rnai-related proteins in ticks and along with our loss-of-function studies support a functional rnai pathway in r. microplus. our preliminary studies indicate that tick rnai pathways may differ from that of other arthropods such as insects.
