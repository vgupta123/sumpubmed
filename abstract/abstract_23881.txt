BACKGROUND
photosynthesis plays a vital role as an energy source for plant metabolism, and its efficiency may be drastically reduced owing to abiotic stresses. moso bamboo , is a renewable and versatile resource with significant ecological and economic value, which encounters high light stress with large amplitude in natural environment. however, the gene expression profiles in response to high light were elusive in bamboo.


RESULTS
we firstly performed physiological experiments on moso bamboo leaves treated with high light . based on the physiological results, three samples of leaves treated with high light for 0 h ,  <dig>  h , and 8 h  were selected to perform further high-throughput rna sequencing , respectively. then, the transcriptomic result demonstrated that the most genes were expressed at a statistically significant value  and the rna-seq data were validated via quantitative real time pcr. moreover, some significant gene expression changes were detected. for instance,  <dig> differentially expressed genes were detected in  <dig> h vs. ck, those in 8h vs. ck were  <dig>  and  <dig> differentially expressed genes were also identified in  <dig> h vs.8 h. besides,  <dig> gene annotations closely related to photosynthesis were refined, including  <dig> genes annotated as light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding  proteins,  <dig> lhc-like proteins and  <dig> psbss. furthermore, the pathway of reactive oxygen species  in photosynthesis was further analyzed. a total of  <dig> genes associated with ros-scavenging were identified. some up-regulated transcript factors, such as nac, wrky, ar2/erf, and bhlh, mainly concentrated in short-term response, while c2h <dig>  hsf, bzip, and myb were largely involved in short and middle terms response to high light.


CONCLUSIONS
based on the gene expression analysis of moso bamboo in response to high light, we thus identified the global gene expression patterns, refined the annotations of lhc protein, lhc-like protein and psbs, detected the pathway of ros as well as identified ros-scavenging genes and transcription factors in the regulation of photosynthetic and related metabolisms. these findings maybe provide a starting point to interpret the molecular mechanism of photosynthesis in moso bamboo under high light stress.
