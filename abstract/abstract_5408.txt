BACKGROUND
iec- <dig> cells are a non-transformed, immortal cell line derived from juvenile rat ileal crypt cells. they may have experimental advantages over tumor-derived gastrointestinal lineages, including preservation of phenotype, normal endocrine responses and retention of differentiation potential. however, their proclivity for spontaneous differentiation / transformation may be stereotypical and could represent a more profound experimental confounder than previously realized. we hypothesized that iec- <dig> cells spontaneously diverge towards a uniform mixture of epigenetic fates, with corresponding phenotypes, rather than persist as a single progenitor lineage.


RESULTS
iec- <dig> cells were cultured for  <dig> hours in serum free media , with and without various insulin-like growth factor agonists to differentially boost the basal rate of proliferation. a strategy was employed to identify constitutive genes as markers of divergent fates through gene array analysis by cross-referencing fold-change trends for individual genes against crypt cell abundance in each treatment. we then confirmed the cell-specific phenotype by immunolocalization of proteins corresponding to those genes. the majority of iec- <dig> cells in sfm alone had a loss in expression of the adenomatous polyposis coli  gene at the mrna and protein levels, consistent with adenoma-like transformation. in addition, a small subset of cells expressed the serotonin receptor 2a gene and had neuroendocrine-like morphology.


CONCLUSIONS
iec- <dig> cells commonly undergo a change in cell fate prior to reaching confluence. the most common fate switch that we were able to detect correlates with a down regulation of the apc gene and transformation into an adenoma-like phenotype.
