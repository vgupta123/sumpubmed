BACKGROUND
α-amylase plays a pivotal role in a broad range of industrial processes. to meet increasing demands of biocatalytic tasks, considerable efforts have been made to isolate enzymes produced by extremophiles. however, the relevant data of α-amylases from cold-adapted fungi are still insufficient. in addition, bread quality presents a particular interest due to its high consummation. thus developing amylases to improve textural properties could combine health benefits with good sensory properties. furthermore, iron oxide nanoparticles provide an economical and convenient method for separation of biomacromolecules. in order to maximize the catalytic efficiency of α-amylase and support further applications, a comprehensive characterization of magnetic immobilization of α-amylase is crucial and needed.


RESULTS
a novel α-amylase  containing an open reading frame of 1482 bp was cloned from antarctic psychrotolerant fungus g. pannorum and then expressed in the newly constructed aspergillus oryzae system. the purified recombinant amya <dig> was approximate 52 kda. amya <dig> was optimally active at ph  <dig>  and 40 °c, and retained over 20% of maximal activity at 0–20 °c. the k
m and v
max values toward soluble starch were  <dig>  mg/ml and  <dig>  × 10− <dig> mg/ respectively, with specific activity of  <dig>  ×  <dig> u/mg. amya <dig> presented broad substrate specificity, and the main hydrolysis products were glucose, maltose, and maltotetraose. the influence of amya <dig> on the quality of bread was further investigated. the application study shows a 26% increase in specific volume,  <dig> % increase in cohesiveness and  <dig> % decrease in gumminess in comparison with the control. amya <dig> was immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles and characterized. the immobilized enzyme showed improved thermostability and enhanced ph tolerance under neutral conditions. also, magnetically immobilized amya <dig> can be easily recovered and reused for maximum utilization.


CONCLUSIONS
a novel α-amylase  from antarctic psychrotolerant fungus was cloned, heterologous expression in aspergillus oryzae, and characterized. the detailed report of the enzymatic properties of amya <dig> gives new insights into fungal cold-adapted amylase. application study showed potential value of amya <dig> in the food and starch fields. in addition, amya <dig> was immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles and characterized. the improved stability and longer service life of amya <dig> could potentially benefit industrial applications.
