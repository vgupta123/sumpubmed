BACKGROUND
the aim of the present study was to describe the activity of a set of opioid drugs, including partial agonists, in a human embryonic kidney cell system stably expressing only the mouse κ-opioid receptors. receptor activation was assessed by measuring the inhibition of cyclic adenosine mono phosphate  production stimulated by  <dig> μm forskolin. intrinsic activities and potencies of these ligands were determined relative to the endogenous ligand dynorphin and the κ agonist with the highest intrinsic activity that was identified in this study, fentanyl.


RESULTS
among the ligands studied naltrexone, win  <dig>  and dezocine, were classified as antagonists, while the remaining ligands were agonists. intrinsic activity of agonists was assessed by determining the extent of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated camp production. the absolute levels of inhibition of camp production by each ligand was used to describe the rank order of intrinsic activity of the agonists; fentanyl = lofentanil ≥ hydromorphone = morphine = nalorphine ≥ etorphine ≥ xorphanol ≥ metazocine ≥ skf  <dig> = cyclazocine ≥ butorphanol > nalbuphine. the rank order of affinity of these ligands was; cyclazocine > naltrexone ≥ skf  <dig> ≥ xorphanol ≥ win  <dig>  > nalorphine > butorphanol > nalbuphine ≥ lofentanil > dezocine ≥ metazocine ≥ morphine > hydromorphone > fentanyl.


CONCLUSIONS
these results elucidate the relative activities of a set of opioid ligands at κ-opioid receptor and can serve as the initial step in a systematic study leading to understanding of the mode of action of these opioid ligands at this receptor.
