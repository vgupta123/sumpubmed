BACKGROUND
midkine , a member of the heparin-binding growth factor family, which includes mk and pleiotrophin, is known to possess neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties in the central nervous system. previous studies have shown that mk is an effective neuroprotective agent in reducing retinal degeneration caused by excessive light and decreasing hippocampal neuronal death in ischemic gerbil brain. the present study was undertaken to investigate whether mk acts as an anticonvulsant in kainic acid -induced seizure in mouse and blocks ka-mediated neuronal cell death in hippocampus.


RESULTS
increased expression of mk was found in hippocampus of mouse following seizures induced by intracerebroventricular injection of ka, and mk expression was found in glial fibrillary acidic protein -positive astrocytes. concurrent injection of mk and ka attenuated ka-induced seizure activity and cell death of hippocampal neurons including pyramidal cells and glutamic acid decarboxylase  <dig> -positive gabaergic interneurons in the ca <dig> and hilar area.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study indicate that mk functions as an anticonvulsant and neuroprotective agent in hippocampus during ka-induced seizures.
