BACKGROUND
the program indeval was originally developed to help researchers find known regions of insertion/deletion activity  in newly determined poaceae trnl-f sequences and compare them with  <dig> previously determined sequences. it is supplied with input files designed for this purpose. more broadly, the program is applicable for finding specific target regions  in dna sequence. a variable region is any specific sequence fragment of interest, such as an indel region, a codon or codons, or sequence coding for a particular rna secondary structure.


RESULTS
indeval input is dna sequence and a template file . additional files contain the variable regions and user-defined messages about the sequence found within them .

variable regions are found by determining the position of flanking sequence  using the lpam  algorithm. this algorithm was designed for indeval and is described here for the first time.

indeval output is an interactive display of the analyzed sequence, broken into user-defined units. once the user is satisfied with the organization of the display, the information can be exported to an annotated text file.


CONCLUSIONS
indeval can find multiple variable regions simultaneously  and display user-selected messages specific to the sequence variants found. indeval output is designed to facilitate comparison between the analyzed sequence and previously evaluated sequence. the program's sensitivity to different levels of nucleotide and/or length variation in conserved regions can be adjusted. indeval is currently available for windows in additional file  <dig> or from .
