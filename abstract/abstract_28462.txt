BACKGROUND
qtl-seq, in combination with bulked segregant analysis and next-generation sequencing , is used to identify loci in small plant genomes, but is technically challenging to perform in species with large genomes, such as barley. a combination of exome sequencing and qtl-seq  was used to map the mono-factorial mendelian locus black lemma and pericarp  and qtls for resistance to net blotch disease, a common disease of barley caused by the fungus pyrenophora teres, which segregated in a population of  <dig> doubled haploid barley lines.

methods
the provisional exome sequences were prepared by ordering the loci of expressed genes based on the genome information and concatenating genes with intervals of 200-bp spacer "n" for each chromosome. the qtl-seq pipeline was used to analyze short reads from the exome-captured library.


RESULTS
in this study, short ngs reads of bulked total dna samples from segregants with extreme trait values were subjected to exome capture, and the resulting exome sequences were aligned to the reference genome. snp allele frequencies were compared to identify the locations of genes/qtls responsible for the trait value differences between lines. for both objective traits examined, exome qtl-seq identified the monogenic mendelian locus and associated qtls. these findings were validated using conventional mapping approaches.


CONCLUSIONS
exome qtl-seq broadens the utility of ngs-based gene/qtl mapping in organisms with large genomes.
