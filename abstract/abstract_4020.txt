BACKGROUND
successful development of iscnt  embryos depends on complex interactions between ooplasmic and nuclear components, which can be compromised by genetic divergence. transfer of ooplasm matching the genetic background of the somatic cell in iscnt embryos is a valuable tool to study the degree of incompatibilities between nuclear and ooplasmic components. this study investigated the effects of ooplasm transfer  on cattle  and plains bison  embryos produced by iscnt and supplemented with or without ooplasm from cattle or plains bison oocytes.


RESULTS
embryos in all groups were analysed for developmental competence that included cleavage rates, atp content, and expression of nuclear- and mitochondrial- encoded genes at 8– <dig> cell stage. interestingly, no significant differences were observed in embryo development, atp content, and expression of nuclear respiratory factor  <dig> , mitochondrial transcription factor a  and mitochondrial subunit  <dig> of cytochrome c oxidase  among groups. thus, although ot did not result in any detrimental effects on the reconstructed embryos due to invasive manipulation, significant benefits of ot were not observed up to the 8– <dig> cell stage.


CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that a viable technique for ot + scnt is possible, however, further understanding of the effects of ot on blastocyst development is necessary.
