BACKGROUND
a number of apicomplexan genomes have been sequenced successfully in recent years and this would help in understanding the biology of apicomplexan parasites. the members of the phylum apicomplexa are important protozoan parasites  that cause some of the deadly diseases in humans and animals. in our earlier studies, we have shown that the standard blosum matrices are not suitable for compositionally biased apicomplexan proteins. so we developed a novel series  of substitution matrices which performed better in comparison to standard blosum matrices and developed apicoalign, a sequence search and alignment tool for apicomplexan proteins. in this study, we demonstrate the higher specificity of these matrices and make an attempt to improve the annotation of apicomplexan kinases and proteases.


RESULTS
the roc curves proved that smat <dig> performs best for apicomplexan proteins followed by compositionally adjusted blosum <dig> , blosum <dig> and blosum <dig> matrices in terms of detecting true positives. the poor e-values and/or bit scores given by smat <dig> matrix for the experimentally identified coccidia-specific oocyst wall proteins against hematozoan  parasites further supported the higher specificity of the same. smat <dig> uniquely detected  orthologs for  <dig> apicomplexan hypothetical proteins against swissprot database and predicted  <dig> kinases and  <dig> proteases. further analysis confirmed the conservation of functional residues of kinase domain in one of the smat <dig> detected kinases. similarly, one of the smat <dig> detected proteases was predicted to be a rhomboid protease.


CONCLUSIONS
the parasite specific substitution matrices have higher specificity for apicomplexan proteins and are helpful in detecting the orthologs missed by blosum matrices and thereby improve the annotation of apicomplexan proteins which are hypothetical or with unknown function.
