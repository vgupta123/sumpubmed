BACKGROUND
members of the ribonuclease  t <dig> family are common models for enzymological studies, and their evolution has been well characterized in plants. this family of acidic rnases is widespread, with members in almost all organisms including plants, animals, fungi, bacteria and even some viruses. while several biological functions have been proposed for these enzymes in plants, their role in animals is unknown. interestingly, in vertebrates most of the biological roles of plant rnase t <dig> proteins are carried out by members of a different family, rnase a. still, rnase t <dig> proteins are conserved in these animals


RESULTS
as a first step to shed light on the role of animal rnase t <dig> enzymes, and to understand the evolution of these proteins while co-existing with the rnase a family, we characterized rnase dre <dig> and rnase dre <dig>  the two rnase t <dig> genes present in the zebrafish  genome. these genes are expressed in most tissues examined, including high expression in all stages of embryonic development, and their expression corresponds well with the presence of acidic rnase activities in every tissue analyzed. embryo expression seems to be a conserved characteristic of members of this family, as other plant and animal rnase t <dig> genes show similar high expression during embryo development. while plant rnase t <dig> proteins and the vertebrate rnase a family show evidences of radiation and gene sorting, vertebrate rnase t <dig> proteins form a monophyletic group, but there is also another monophyletic group defining a fish-specific rnase t <dig> clade.


CONCLUSIONS
based on gene expression and phylogenetic analyses we propose that rnase t <dig> enzymes carry out a housekeeping function. this conserved biological role probably kept rnase t <dig> enzymes in animal genomes in spite of the presence of rnases a. a hypothetical role during embryo development is also discussed.
