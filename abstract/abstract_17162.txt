BACKGROUND
the worldwide outbreak of influenza a  viruses among poultry species and humans highlighted the need to develop efficacious and safe vaccines based on efficient and scaleable production.


RESULTS
white spot syndrome virus  immediate-early promoter one  was shown to be a stronger promoter for gene expression in insect cells compared with cytomegalovirus immediate-early  promoter in luciferase assays. in an attempt to improve expression efficiency, a recombinant baculovirus was constructed expressing hemagglutinin  of h5n <dig> influenza virus under the control of wssv ie <dig> promoter. ha expression in sf <dig> cells increased significantly with baculovirus under wssv ie <dig> promoter, compared with cmv promoter based on ha contents and hemagglutination activity. further, immunization with baculovirus under wssv ie <dig> promoter in chickens elicited higher level anti-ha antibodies compared to cmv promoter, as indicated in hemagglutination inhibition, virus neutralization and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. by immunohistochemistry, strong ha antigen expression was observed in different chicken organs with vaccination of wssv ie <dig> promoter controlled baculovirus, confirming higher efficiency in ha expression by wssv ie <dig> promoter.


CONCLUSIONS
the production of h <dig> ha by baculovirus was enhanced with wssv ie <dig> promoter, especially compared with cmv promoter. this contributed to effective elicitation of ha-specific antibody in vaccinated chickens. this study provides an alternative choice for baculovirus based vaccine production.
