BACKGROUND
we aimed to investigate the effect of early-life diverse microbial exposures on gut microbial colonization in an ova-induced asthma model in balb/c mice.

methods
balb/c mice were divided into  <dig> groups: a, offsprings were kept in a spf environment during fetal, lactation, and childhood periods; b, offsprings were kept in the spf environment during fetal and lactation periods, and kept in the general environment during childhood; c, offsprings were kept in the spf environment only during fetal period, and then kept in the general environment; and d, offsprings were kept in the general environment during whole periods. the diversity of intestinal flora was analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. mice were sensitized with ova to establish an animal model of asthma. then asthma-related inflammatory cytokines and histological analysis were performed.


RESULTS
the diversity of intestinal microflora in group d was significantly higher than groups a, b and c at three days and three weeks after birth, and the diversity of intestinal microflora in groups c and d were significantly higher than groups a and b at five weeks after birth. the pathologic scores of ova-induced asthmatic mice in group d were significantly lower than group a, and serum ifn-γ levels and the ifn-γ/il- <dig> ratio in group d were significantly higher than group a.


CONCLUSIONS
exposure to diverse microbial environments in early life affects gut microbial colonization in balb/c mice. the diversity of the intestinal flora in early life may prevent airway inflammation in asthma via regulating the th1/th <dig> balance.
