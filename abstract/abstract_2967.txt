BACKGROUND
plants have evolved complex mechanisms to adapt growth and development to the light environment. the cop1/spa complex is a key repressor of photomorphogenesis in dark-grown arabidopsis plants and acts as an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase to ubiquitinate transcription factors involved in the light response. in the light, cop1/spa activity is inhibited by photoreceptors, thereby allowing accumulation of these transcription factors and a subsequent light response. previous results have shown that the four members of the spa family exhibit partially divergent functions. in particular, spa <dig> and spa <dig> strongly differ in their responsiveness to light, while they have indistinguishable activities in darkness. the much higher light-responsiveness of spa <dig> is partially explained by the much stronger light-induced degradation of spa <dig> when compared to spa <dig>  here, we have conducted spa1/spa <dig> domain swap experiments to identify the protein domain responsible for the functional divergence between spa <dig> and spa <dig> 


RESULTS
we have individually swapped the three domains between spa <dig> and spa <dig> - the n-terminal kinase-like domain, the coiled-coil domain and the wd-repeat domain - and expressed them in spa mutant arabidopsis plants. the phenotypes of transgenic seedlings show that the respective n-terminal kinase-like domain is primarily responsible for the respective light-responsiveness of spa <dig> and spa <dig>  furthermore, the most divergent part of the n-terminal domain was sufficient to confer a spa1- or spa2-like activity to the respective spa protein. the stronger light-induced degradation of spa <dig> when compared to spa <dig> was also primarily conferred by the spa <dig> n-terminal domain. at last, the different affinities of spa <dig> and spa <dig> for cryptochrome  <dig> are defined by the n-terminal domain of the respective spa protein. in contrast, both spa <dig> and spa <dig> similarly interacted with cop <dig> in light-grown seedlings.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the distinct activities and protein stabilities of spa <dig> and spa <dig> in light-grown seedlings are primarily encoded by their n-terminal kinase-like domains. similarly, the different affinities of spa <dig> and spa <dig> for cry <dig> are explained by their respective n-terminal domain. hence, after a duplication event during evolution, the n-terminal domains of spa <dig> and spa <dig> underwent subfunctionalization, possibly to allow optimal adaptation of growth and development to a changing light environment.
