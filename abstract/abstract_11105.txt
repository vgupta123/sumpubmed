BACKGROUND
campylobacter jejuni is a gastrointestinal pathogen of humans, but part of the normal flora of poultry, and therefore grows well at the respective body temperatures of 37°c and 42°c. proteomic studies on temperature regulation in c. jejuni strain 81– <dig> revealed the upregulation at 37°c of cj <dig>  a predicted periplasmic chaperone that is similar to proteins involved in outer membrane protein folding and virulence in other bacteria.


RESULTS
the cj <dig> gene was highly conserved in  <dig> strains and species of campylobacter, implying the importance of this gene. to study the role that cj <dig> plays in c. jejuni pathogenesis, a mutant derivative of strain 81– <dig> was constructed in which the cj <dig> gene was precisely deleted. a revertant of this mutant was isolated by restoring the gene to its original chromosomal location using streptomycin counterselection. the cj <dig> mutant strain demonstrated a slightly decreased growth rate and lower final growth yield, yet was more motile and more invasive of human intestinal epithelial cells than wild-type. in either single or mixed infections, the mutant was less able to colonize mice than 81– <dig>  the cj <dig> mutant also expressed altered levels of several proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
mutation of cj <dig> has an effect on phenotypes related to c. jejuni pathogenesis, probably due to its role in the proper folding of critical outer membrane proteins.
