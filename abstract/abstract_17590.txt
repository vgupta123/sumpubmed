BACKGROUND
calcium sparks are ryanodine receptor mediated transient calcium signals that have been shown to hyperpolarize the membrane potential by activating large conductance calcium activated potassium  channels in vascular smooth muscle cells. along with voltage-dependent calcium channels, they form a signaling unit that has a vasodilatory influence on vascular diameter and regulation of myogenic tone. the existence and role of calcium sparks has hitherto been unexplored in the spiral modiolar artery, the end artery that controls blood flow to the cochlea. the goal of the present study was to determine the presence and properties of calcium sparks in the intact gerbil spiral modiolar artery.


RESULTS
calcium sparks were recorded from smooth muscle cells of intact arteries loaded with fluo- <dig> am. calcium sparks occurred with a frequency of  <dig>  hz, a rise time of  <dig> ms and a time to half-decay of  <dig> ms. ryanodine reduced spark frequency within  <dig> min from  <dig>  to  <dig>  hz. caffeine  increased spark frequency from  <dig>  to  <dig>  hz and prolonged rise and half-decay times from  <dig> to  <dig> ms and from  <dig> to  <dig> ms, respectively. elevation of potassium , presumably via depolarization, increased spark frequency from  <dig>  to  <dig>  hz. neither ryanodine nor depolarization changed rise or decay times.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first characterization of calcium sparks in smooth muscle cells of the spiral modiolar artery. the results suggest that calcium sparks may regulate the diameter of the spiral modiolar artery and cochlear blood flow.
