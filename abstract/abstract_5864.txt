BACKGROUND
the ribosomal protein sa , previously named 37-kda laminin receptor precursor/67-kda laminin receptor  is a multifunctional protein that plays a role in a number of pathological processes, such as cancer and prion diseases. in all investigated species, rpsa is a member of a multicopy gene family consisting of one full length functional gene and several pseudogenes. therefore, for studies on rpsa related pathways/pathologies, it is important to characterize the whole family and to address the possible function of the other rpsa family members. the present work aims at deciphering the rpsa family in sheep.


RESULTS
in addition to the full length functional ovine rpsa gene,  <dig> other members of this multicopy gene family, all processed pseudogenes, were identified. comparison between the rpsa transcript and these pseudogenes shows a large variety in sequence identities ranging from 99% to 74%. only one of the  <dig> pseudogenes, i.e. rpsap <dig>  shares the same open reading frame  of  <dig> amino acids with the rpsa gene, differing in only one amino acid. all members of the rpsa family were annotated by comparative mapping and fluorescence in situ hybridization  localization. transcription was investigated in the cerebrum, cerebellum, spleen, muscle, lymph node, duodenum and blood, and transcripts were detected for  <dig> of the  <dig> pseudogenes in some of these tissues.


CONCLUSIONS
in the present work we have characterized the ovine rpsa family. our results have revealed the existence of  <dig> ovine rpsa pseudogenes and provide new data on their structure and sequence. such information will facilitate molecular studies of the functional rpsa gene taking into account the existence of these pseudogenes in the design of experiments. it remains to be investigated if the transcribed members are functional as regulatory non-coding rna or as functional proteins.
