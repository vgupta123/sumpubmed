BACKGROUND
computational modelling has become an important tool in understanding biological systems such as signalling pathways. with an increase in size complexity of models comes a need for techniques to manage model versions and their relationship to one another. model version control for pathway models shares some of the features of software version control but has a number of differences that warrant a specific solution.


RESULTS
we present a model version control method, along with a prototype implementation, based on xml patches. we show its application to the egf/ras/raf pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
our method allows quick and convenient storage of a wide range of model variations and enables a thorough explanation of these variations. trying to produce these results without such methods results in slow and cumbersome development that is prone to frustration and human error.
