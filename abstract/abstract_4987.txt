BACKGROUND
identification of disease genes for type  <dig> diabetes  by traditional methods has yielded limited success. based on our previous observation that t2d may result from disturbed protein-protein interactions affected through disrupting modular domain interactions, here we have designed an approach to rank the candidates in the t2d linked genomic regions as plausible disease genes.


RESULTS
our approach integrates weight value  method followed by prioritization using clustering coefficients derived from domain interaction network. wv for each candidate is calculated based on the assumption that disease genes might be functionally related, mainly facilitated by interactions among domains of the interacting proteins. the benchmarking using a test dataset comprising of both known t2d genes and non-t2d genes revealed that wv method had a sensitivity and specificity of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively with  <dig> fold enrichment. the candidate genes having a wv >  <dig>  were called high weight elements . further, we ranked hwes by using the network property-the clustering coefficient . each hwe with a ci <  <dig>  was prioritized as plausible disease candidates  as previous studies indicate that disease genes tend to avoid dense clustering . this method further prioritized the identified disease genes with a sensitivity of  <dig>  and a specificity of  <dig>  and enriched the candidate list by  <dig>  fold. thus, from the dataset of  <dig> positional candidates the method ranked  <dig> to be most likely disease candidates. the gene ontology sharing for the candidates showed higher representation of metabolic and signaling processes. the approach also captured genes with unknown functions which were characterized by network motif analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
prioritization of positional candidates is essential for cost-effective and an expedited discovery of disease genes. here, we demonstrate a novel approach for disease candidate prioritization from numerous loci linked to t2d.
