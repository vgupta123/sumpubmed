BACKGROUND
next-generation sequencing  allows for sampling numerous viral variants from infected patients. this provides a novel opportunity to represent and study the mutational landscape of hepatitis c virus  within a single host.


RESULTS
intra-host variants of the hcv e1/e <dig> region were extensively sampled from  <dig> chronically infected patients. after ngs error correction, the average number of reads and variants obtained from each sample were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the distance between each pair of variants was calculated and networks were created for each patient, where each node is a variant and two nodes are connected by a link if the nucleotide distance between them is  <dig>  the work focused on large components having > 5% of all reads, which in average account for  <dig> % of all reads found in a patient.

the distance between any two variants calculated over the component correlated strongly with nucleotide distances , a better correlation than the one obtained with neighbour-joining trees . in each patient, components were well separated, with the average distance between  being  <dig> times greater than within each component . the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes was calculated and some patients  showed a mixture of networks under strong negative and positive selection. all components were robust to in silico stochastic sampling; even after randomly removing 85% of all reads, the largest connected component in the new subsample still involved  <dig> % of remaining nodes. in vitro sampling showed that  <dig> % of components present in the original sample were also found in experimental replicas, with  <dig> % of reads found in both. when syringe-sharing transmission events were simulated,  <dig> % of all simulated transmission events seeded all components present in the source.


CONCLUSIONS
most intra-host variants are organized into distinct single-mutation components that are: well separated from each other, represent genetic distances between viral variants, robust to sampling, reproducible and likely seeded during transmission events. facilitated by ngs, large components offer a novel evolutionary framework for genetic analysis of intra-host viral populations and understanding transmission, immune escape and drug resistance.
