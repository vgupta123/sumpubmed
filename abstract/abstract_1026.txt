BACKGROUND
lactobacillus fermentum is economically important in the production and preservation of fermented foods. a repeatable and discriminative typing method was devised to characterize l. fermentum at the molecular level. the multilocus sequence typing  scheme developed was based on analysis of the internal sequence of  <dig> housekeeping gene fragments .


RESULTS
mlst analysis of  <dig> isolates of l. fermentum from mongolia and seven provinces/ autonomous regions in china identified  <dig> sequence types ,  <dig> of which were represented by only a single isolate, indicating high genetic diversity. phylogenetic analyses based on the sequence of the  <dig> housekeeping gene fragments indicated that the l. fermentum isolates analyzed belonged to two major groups. a standardized index of association  indicated a weak clonal population structure in l. fermentum. split decomposition analysis indicated that recombination played an important role in generating the genetic diversity observed in l. fermentum. the results from the minimum spanning tree strongly suggested that evolution of l. fermentum sts was not correlated with geography or food-type.


CONCLUSIONS
the mlst scheme developed will be valuable for further studies on the evolution and population structure of l. fermentum isolates used in food products.
