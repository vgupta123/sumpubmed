BACKGROUND
antimicrobial susceptibility testing of microorganisms is performed by either disc diffusion or broth dilution tests. in clinical use, the tests are often still performed manually although automated systems exist. most systems, however, are based on turbidometric methods which have well-known drawbacks.


RESULTS
in this study we evaluated isothermal micro calorimetry  for the determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations  of  <dig> antibiotics for five micro-organisms. here we present the data for the  <dig> antibiotics and two representative microorganisms e. coli  and s. aureus . imc was able to determine the mics correctly according to clsi values. since mics require  <dig> hours, time was not reduced. however, imc provided new additional data – a continuous record of heat-producing bacterial activity  in calorimetry ampoules at subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations. key features of the heatflow  and aggregate heat  vs. time curves were identified . antibiotics with similar modes of action proved to have similar effects on tdelay and/or Δq/Δt.


CONCLUSIONS
imc can be a powerful tool for determining the effects of antibiotics on microorganisms in vitro. it easily provides accurate mics – plus a potential means for analyzing and comparing the modes of action of antibiotics at subinhibitory concentrations. also imc is completely passive, so after evaluation, ampoule contents  can be analyzed by any other method desired.
