BACKGROUND
congenital sensorineural deafness  is the most common type of deafness in dogs and it occurs in numerous canine breeds including the english bull terrier. this study estimates prevalence, heritability and genetic correlations of csd and coat pigmentation phenotypes in the english bull terrier in england.


RESULTS
hearing status was assessed by brainstem auditory evoked response in  <dig> english bull terrier puppies tested at 30– <dig>  days of age as complete litters. gender, coat and iris colour and parental hearing status were recorded.

the prevalence of csd in all  <dig> puppies was  <dig>  % with  <dig>  % unilaterally deaf and  <dig>  % bilaterally deaf. the coat was predominately coloured in  <dig>  % puppies and white with or without a patch in  <dig>  % puppies. the majority  of deaf puppies had a white coat ;  <dig>  % of the puppies with a white coat  were deaf.

heritability and genetic correlations were estimated using residual maximum likelihood. heritability of hearing status as a trichotomous trait  was estimated at  <dig>  to  <dig>  and was significantly different to zero . heritability of coat pigmentation phenotype  was  <dig>  . genetic correlation of csd with coat pigmentation phenotype was estimated at − <dig>  to − <dig>  , but was not significantly larger than zero . analysis of csd in all white and white patched puppies only estimated the heritability of csd as  <dig>  and was significantly greater than zero , and the heritability of coat colour  as  <dig>  . the genetic correlation was estimated at − <dig>  to − <dig>   but was just above the statistical threshold determining significant difference to zero .


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that csd occurs predominantly in white english bull terriers and there is genetic variation in csd beyond that associated with coat colour.
