BACKGROUND
from december  <dig> through june  <dig>  the us experienced the most costly highly pathogenic avian influenza  outbreak to date. most cases in commercial poultry were caused by an h5n <dig> strain which was a reassortant with  <dig> eurasian lineage genes, including a clade  <dig> . <dig>  goose/guangdong/ <dig> lineage hemagglutinin, and  <dig> genes from north american wild waterfowl low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses. the outbreak primarily affected turkeys and table-egg layer type chickens. three isolates were selected for characterization in turkeys: the us index isolate from december  <dig> , and two poultry isolates from april  <dig> .


RESULTS
four week old broad-breasted white turkeys were inoculated with one of three doses  of each of the isolates to evaluate infectious dose and pathogenesis. the mean bird infectious dose of a/northern pintail/wa/40964/ <dig> and a/turkey/mn/12528/ <dig> was  <dig> eid <dig> per bird, but was  <dig> eid <dig> per bird for a/chicken/ia/13388/ <dig>  suggesting the latter had greater adaptation to gallinaceous birds. all three isolates had unusually long mean death time of  <dig> – <dig>  days post challenge, and the primary clinical signs were severe lethargy and neurological signs which started no more than 24 h before death . infected turkeys also shed high levels of virus by both the oropharyngeal and cloacal routes.


CONCLUSIONS
the unusually long mean death times, high levels of virus in feces, and increased adaptation of the later viruses may have contributed to the rapid spread of the virus during the peak of the outbreak.
