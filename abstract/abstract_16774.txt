BACKGROUND
nadph oxidases  are ros producing enzymes that perform essential roles in cell physiology, including cell signaling and antimicrobial defense. this gene family is present in most eukaryotes, suggesting a common ancestor. to date, only a limited number of phylogenetic studies of metazoan noxes have been performed, with few arthropod genes. in arthropods, only nox <dig> and duox genes have been found and a gene called noxm was found in mosquitoes but its origin and function has not been examined. in this study, we analyzed the evolution of this gene family in arthropods. a thorough search of genomes and transcriptomes was performed enabling us to browse most branches of arthropod phylogeny.


RESULTS
we have found that the subfamilies nox <dig> and duox are present in all arthropod groups. we also show that a nox gene, closely related to nox <dig> and previously found only in mosquitoes , can also be found in other taxonomic groups, leading us to rename it as nox4-art. although the accessory protein p22-phox, essential for nox1- <dig> activation, was not found in any of the arthropods studied, nox4-art of aedes aegypti encodes an active protein that produces h2o <dig>  although nox4-art has been lost in a number of arthropod lineages, it has all the domains and many signature residues and motifs necessary for ros production and, when silenced, h2o <dig> production is considerably diminished in a. aegypti cells.


CONCLUSIONS
combining all bioinformatic analyses and laboratory work we have reached interesting conclusions regarding arthropod nox gene family evolution. nox <dig> and duox are present in all arthropod lineages but it seems that a nox2-like gene was lost in the ancestral lineage leading to ecdysozoa. the nox4-art gene originated from a nox4-like ancestor and is functional. although no p22-phox was observed in arthropods, there was no evidence of neo-functionalization and this gene probably produces h2o <dig> as in other metazoan nox <dig> genes. although functional and present in the genomes of many species, nox4-art was lost in a number of arthropod lineages.
