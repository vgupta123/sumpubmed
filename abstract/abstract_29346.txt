BACKGROUND
genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms  is a fundamental technology in modern genetics. the snplex™ mid-throughput genotyping system  enables the multiplexed genotyping of up to  <dig> snps simultaneously in a single dna sample. the high level of automation and the large amount of data produced in a high-throughput laboratory require advanced software tools for quality control and workflow management.


RESULTS
we have developed two programs, which address two main aspects of quality control in a snplex™ genotyping environment: gmfilter improves the analysis of snplex™ plates by removing wells with a low overall signal intensity. it enables scientists to automatically process the raw data in a standardized way before analyzing a plate with the proprietary genemapper software from applied biosystems. sxtestplate examines the genotype concordance of a snplex™ test plate, which was typed with a control snp set. this program allows for regular quality control checks of a snplex™ genotyping platform. it is compatible to other genotyping methods as well.


CONCLUSIONS
gmfilter and sxtestplate provide a valuable tool set for laboratories engaged in genotyping based on the snplex™ system. the programs enhance the analysis of snplex™ plates with the genemapper software and enable scientists to evaluate the performance of their genotyping platform.
