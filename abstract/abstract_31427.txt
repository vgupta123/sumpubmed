BACKGROUND
stearoyl-coa desaturase  <dig>  desaturates long chain fatty acids and is therefore a key enzyme in fat catabolism. its synthesis is downregulated in liver during illnesses caused by high levels of circulating lipopolysaccharide . scd <dig> expression is known to be stimulated under adipogenic conditions through a variety of transcription factors, notably srebp <dig> and c/ebpα and −β. however, mechanisms downregulating scd <dig> expression during illness related reprograming of the metabolism were unknown. escherichia coli elicited mastitis is an example of such a condition and was found to downregulates milk and milk fat synthesis. this is in part mediated through epigenetic mechanisms. we analyzed here mechanism controlling scd <dig> expression in livers and udders from cows suffering from experimentally induced e. coli mastitis.


RESULTS
we validated with rt-qpcr that scd <dig> expression was reduced in these organs of the experimental cows. they also featured decreased levels of mrnas encoding srebp1a but increased levels for c/ebp α and −β. chromatin accessibility pcr  revealed that downregulation of scd <dig> expression in liver was not caused by tighter chromatin compaction of the scd <dig> promoter. reporter gene analyses showed in liver  and mammary epithelial  model cells that overexpression of srebp1a expectedly activated the promoter, while unexpectedly c/ebpα and −β strongly quenched the promoter activity. abrogation of two from among of the three c/ebp dna-binding motifs of the promoter revealed that c/ebpα acts in cis but c/ebpβ in trans. overexpressing truncated c/ebpα or −β factors lacking their repressive domains confirmed in both model cells the direct action of c/ebpα, but not of c/ebpβ on the promoter.


CONCLUSIONS
we found no evidence that epigenetic mechanism remodeling the chromatin compaction of the scd <dig> promoter would contribute to downregulate scd <dig> expression during infection. instead, our data show for the first time that c/ebp factors may repress scd <dig> expression in liver and udder rather than stimulating as it was previously shown in adipocytes. this cell type specific dual and opposite function of c/ebp factors for regulating scd <dig> expression was previously unknown. infection related activation of their expression combined with downregulated expression of srebp1a explains reduced scd <dig> expression in liver and udder during acute mastitis.
