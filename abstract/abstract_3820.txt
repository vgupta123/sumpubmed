BACKGROUND
long non-coding rnas  have been identified as gene regulatory elements that influence the transcription of their neighbouring protein-coding genes. the discovery of lncrnas in animals has stimulated genome-wide scans for these elements across plant genomes. recently,  <dig> lincrnas were putatively identified in arabidopsis thaliana , however there is limited information on their conservation.


RESULTS
using a phylogenomics approach, we assessed the positional and sequence conservation of these lncrnas by analyzing the genomes of the basal brassicaceae species aethionema arabicum and tarenaya hassleriana of the sister-family cleomaceae. furthermore, we generated transcriptomes for another three aethionema species and one other cleomaceae species to validate their transcriptional activity. we show that a subset of lncrnas are highly diverged at the nucleotide level, but conserved by position . positionally conserved lncrnas that are expressed neighbour important developmental and physiological genes. interestingly, >65 % of the positionally conserved lncrnas are located within  <dig>  mb of telomeres in arabidopsis thaliana chromosomes.


CONCLUSIONS
these results highlight the importance of analysing not only sequence conservation, but also positional conservation of non-coding genetic elements in plants including lncrnas.
