BACKGROUND
we compared igf responses of fetal and adult intestinal fibroblasts to identify a developmental difference in the igf-axis. intestinal fibroblasts were isolated from maternal and fetal jejunum. media was conditioned at confluence and one week afterwards. the proliferative response at confluence to  <dig> nm igf-i or -ii was compared.


RESULTS
there were no significant differences in igfbp expression at confluence. post-confluence, fetal fibroblasts had no significant changes in igfbp- <dig> and igfbp- <dig> expression. post-confluent maternal fibroblasts had increased igfbp- <dig> levels that were significant compared to the fetal fibroblasts. igf-i increased in post-confluent fetal fibroblasts, while in maternal fibroblasts it decreased . igf-ii secretion decreased significantly in post-confluent maternal fibroblasts . maternal fibroblasts proliferated more with igf-i than igf-ii . fetal fibroblasts responded to igf-ii slightly better than igf-i and significantly greater than maternal cells .


CONCLUSIONS
fetal intestinal fibroblasts respond to igf-ii with greater proliferation and do not have the increased igfbps seen post-confluence in adult intestinal fibroblasts.
