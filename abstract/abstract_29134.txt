BACKGROUND
two component lantibiotics, such as the plasmid-encoded lacticin  <dig> produced by lactococcus lactis dpc <dig> and staphylococcin c <dig> produced by staphylococcus aureus c <dig>  represent an emerging subgroup of bacteriocins. these two bacteriocins are particularly closely related, exhibiting 86%  and 55%  identity in their component peptides. the aim of this study was to investigate, for the first time for any two component bacteriocins, the significance of the relatedness between these two systems.


RESULTS
so close is this relatedness that the hybrid peptide pairs ltna1:c55β and c55α:ltna <dig> were found to have activities in the single nanomolar range, comparing well with the native pairings. to determine whether this flexibility extended to the associated post-translational modification/processing machinery, the staphylococcin c <dig> structural genes were directly substituted for their lacticin  <dig> counterparts in the ltn operon on the large conjugative lactococcal plasmid pmrc <dig>  it was established that the lacticin ltna <dig> post-translational and processing machinery could produce functionally active c55α, but not c55β. in order to investigate in closer detail the significance of the differences between ltna <dig> and c55α, three residues in ltna <dig> were replaced with the equivalent residues in c55α. surprisingly, one such mutant ltna1-leu21ala was not produced. this may be significant given the positioning of this residue in a putative lipid ii binding loop.


CONCLUSIONS
it is apparent, despite sharing striking similarities in terms of structure and activity, that these two complex bacteriocins display some highly dedicated features particular to either system.
