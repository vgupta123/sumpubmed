BACKGROUND
prostatic acid phosphatase  is an enzyme that is produced primarily in the prostate and functions as a cell growth regulator and potential tumor suppressor. understanding the genetic regulation of this enzyme is important because pap plays an important role in prostate cancer and is expressed in other tissues such as the brain.

methods
we tested association between  <dig>  m snps and pap levels in cerebrospinal fluid across  <dig> individuals in two datasets using linear regression. we then performed meta-analyses using metal =with a significance threshold of p < 5 × 10− <dig> and removed snps where the direction of the effect was different between the two datasets, identifying  <dig> candidate snps that affect pap cerebrospinal fluid levels. we analyzed each of these snps individually and prioritized snps that had biologically meaningful functional annotations in wannovar  or had a regulomedb score less than  <dig> 


RESULTS
thirteen snps met our criteria, suggesting they are candidate causal alleles that underlie acpp regulation and expression.


CONCLUSIONS
given pap’s expression in the brain and its role as a cell-growth regulator and tumor suppressor, our results have important implications in brain health such as cancer and other brain diseases including neurodegenerative diseases  and mental health .
