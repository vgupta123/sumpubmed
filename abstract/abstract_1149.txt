BACKGROUND
lysosomes are the major catabolic compartment within eukaryotic cells, and their biogenesis requires the integration of the biosynthetic and endosomal pathways. endocytosis and autophagy are the primary inputs of the lysosomal degradation pathway. endocytosis is specifically needed for the degradation of membrane proteins whereas autophagy is responsible for the degradation of cytoplasmic components. we previously identified the deubiquitinating enzyme ubpy/usp <dig> as being necessary for lysosomal biogenesis and productive autophagy in drosophila. because ubpy/usp <dig> has been widely described for its function in the endosomal system, we hypothesized that disrupting the endosomal pathway itself may affect the biogenesis of the lysosomes.


RESULTS
in the present study, we blocked the progression of the endosomal pathway at different levels of maturation of the endosomes by expressing in fat body cells either dsrnas or dominant negative mutants targeting components of the endosomal machinery: shibire, rab <dig>  rab <dig>  chmp <dig> and rab <dig>  we observed that inhibition of endosomal trafficking at different steps in vivo is systematically associated with defects in lysosome biogenesis, resulting in autophagy flux blockade.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the integrity of the endosomal system is required for lysosome biogenesis and productive autophagy in vivo.
