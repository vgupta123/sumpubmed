BACKGROUND
antillatoxin  is a structurally unique lipopeptide produced by the marine cyanobacterium lyngbya majuscula. atx activates voltage-gated sodium channel α-subunits at an undefined recognition site and stimulates sodium influx in neurons. however, the pharmacological properties and selectivity of atx on the sodium channel α-subunits were not fully characterized.


RESULTS
in this study, we characterized the pharmacological properties and selectivity of atx in cells heterologously expressing rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  or rnav <dig>  α-subunits by using the na+ selective fluorescent dye, sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate. atx produced sodium influx in cells expressing each sodium channel α-subunit, whereas two other sodium channel activators, veratridine and brevetoxin- <dig>  were without effect. the atx potency at rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  did not differ significantly. similarly, there were no significant differences in the efficacy for atx-induced sodium influx between rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  α-subunits. atx also produced robust ca2+ influx relative to other sodium channel activators in the calcium-permeable deaa mutant of rnav <dig>  α-subunit. finally, we demonstrated that the 8-demethyl- <dig> -dihydro-antillatoxin analog was less efficacious and less potent in stimulating sodium influx.


CONCLUSIONS
atx displayed a unique efficacy with respect to stimulation of sodium influx in cells expressing rnav <dig> , rnav <dig>  and rnav <dig>  α-subunits. the efficacy of atx was distinctive inasmuch as it was not shared by activators of neurotoxin sites  <dig> and  <dig> on vgsc α-subunits. given the unique pharmacological properties of atx interaction with sodium channel α-subunits, decoding the molecular determinants and mechanism of action of antillatoxin may provide further insight into sodium channel gating mechanisms.
