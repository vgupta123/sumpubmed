BACKGROUND
filamentous tropical marine cyanobacteria such as moorea producens strain jhb possess a rich community of heterotrophic bacteria on their polysaccharide sheaths; however, these bacterial communities have not yet been adequately studied or characterized.

results and discussion
through efforts to sequence the genome of this cyanobacterial strain, the  <dig>  mb genome of an unknown bacterium emerged from the metagenomic information, named here as mor <dig>  analysis of its genome revealed that the bacterium is heterotrophic and belongs to the phylum acidobacteria, subgroup 22; however, it is only  <dig> % identical to the nearest cultured representative. comparative genomics further revealed that mor <dig> has a large number of genes involved in transcriptional regulation, is completely devoid of transposases, is not able to synthesize the full complement of proteogenic amino acids and appears to lack genes for nitrate uptake. mor <dig> was found to be present in lab cultures of m. producens collected from various locations, but not other cyanobacterial species. diverse efforts failed to culture the bacterium separately from filaments of m. producens jhb. additionally, a co-culturing experiment between m. producens jhb possessing mor <dig> and cultures of other genera of cyanobacteria indicated that the bacterium was not transferable.

conclusion
the data presented support a specific relationship between this novel uncultured bacterium and m. producens, however, verification of this proposed relationship cannot be done until the “uncultured” bacterium can be cultured.
