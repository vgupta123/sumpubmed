BACKGROUND
hybridization or divergence between sympatric sister species provides a natural laboratory to study speciation processes. the shared polymorphism in sister species may either be ancestral or derive from hybridization, and the accuracy of analytic methods used thus far to derive convincing evidence for the occurrence of present day hybridization is largely debated.


RESULTS
here we propose the application of network analysis to test for the occurrence of present day hybridization between the two species of brown algae fucus spiralis and f. vesiculosus. individual-centered networks were analyzed on the basis of microsatellite genotypes from north africa to the pacific american coast, through the north atlantic. two genetic distances integrating different time steps were used, the rozenfeld  and the shared allele  distances. a diagnostic level of genotype divergence and clustering of individuals from each species was obtained through rd while screening for exchanges through putative hybridization was facilitated using sad. intermediate individuals linking both clusters on the rd network were those sampled at the limits of the sympatric zone in northwest iberia.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggesting rare hybridization were confirmed by simulation of hybrids and f <dig> with directed backcrosses. comparison with the bayesian method structure confirmed the usefulness of both approaches and emphasized the reliability of network analysis to unravel and study hybridization
