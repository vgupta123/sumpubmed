BACKGROUND
in society, there is a clear need to improve the success rate of techniques to restore fertility. therefore a deeper knowledge of the dynamics of the complex molecular environment that regulates human gametogenesis and  folliculogenesis in vivo is necessary. here, we have studied these processes focusing on the formation of the follicular basement membrane  in vivo.


RESULTS
the distribution of the main components of the extracellular matrix  collagen iv, laminin and fibronectin by week  <dig> of gestation  in the ovarian cortex revealed the existence of ovarian cords and of a distinct mesenchymal compartment, resembling the organization in the male gonads. by w <dig>  the first primordial follicles were assembled individually in that  mesenchymal compartment and were already encapsulated by a bm of collagen iv and laminin, but not fibronectin. in adults, in the primary and secondary follicles, collagen iv, laminin and to a lesser extent fibronectin were prominent in the follicular bm.


CONCLUSIONS
the ecm-molecular niche compartimentalizes the female gonads from the time of germ cell colonization until adulthood. this knowledge may contribute to improve methods to recreate the environment needed for successful folliculogenesis in vitro and that would benefit a large number of infertility patients.
