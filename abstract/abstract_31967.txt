BACKGROUND
oat is an important crop in north america and northern europe. in scandinavia, yields are limited by the fact that oat cannot be used as a winter crop. in order to develop such a crop, more knowledge about mechanisms of cold tolerance in oat is required.


RESULTS
from an oat cdna library  <dig> single-pass est sequences were obtained. the library was prepared from pooled rna samples isolated from leaves of four-week old avena sativa  plants incubated at +4Â°c for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours. exclusion of sequences shorter than  <dig> bp resulted in  <dig> high-quality ests with a mean length of  <dig>  bp. clustering and assembly identified a set of  <dig> different transcripts denoted the avena sativa cold induced unigene set . taking advantage of various tools and databases, putative functions were assigned to  <dig>  of these genes. of the remaining  <dig> unclassified sequences,  <dig> appeared to be oat-specific since they lacked any significant sequence similarity  to any sequence available in the public databases. of the  <dig> unigene sequences,  <dig> displayed significant homology  to genes previously reported to be involved in cold stress related processes.  <dig> novel oat transcription factors were also identified, out of which  <dig> were similar to genes previously shown to be cold induced. the cbf transcription factors have a major role in regulating cold acclimation. four oat cbf sequences were found, belonging to the monocot cluster of dreb family erf/ap <dig> domain proteins. finally in the total est sequence data  approximately  <dig> potential ssrs were found, a frequency similar to what has previously been identified in arabidopsis ests.


CONCLUSIONS
the asciunigene set will now be used to fabricate an oat biochip, to perform various expression studies with different oat cultivars incubated at varying temperatures, to generate molecular markers and provide tools for various genetic transformation experiments in oat. this will lead to a better understanding of the cellular biology of this important crop and will open up new ways to improve its agronomical properties.
