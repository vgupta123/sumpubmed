BACKGROUND
the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion followed by its controlled release at the metaphase to anaphase transition is necessary for faithful segregation of chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis. cohesion is established by the action of ctf7/eco <dig> on the cohesin complex during dna replication following loading of cohesin onto chromatin by the scc2-scc <dig> complex. ctf <dig> is also required for sister chromatid cohesion during repair of dna double strand breaks. ctf <dig> contains an acetyltransferase domain and a zinc finger motif and acetylates conserved lysine residues in the smc <dig> subunit of cohesin. in arabidopsis ctf <dig> is encoded by a single gene and mutations in atctf <dig> cause embryo lethality indicating that the gene is essential.


RESULTS
to study the function of ctf <dig> in plants and to determine its role in sister chromatid cohesion, we constructed a conditional allele of atctf <dig> in arabidopsis using an inducible rna interference  strategy, so as to avoid the embryo lethality caused by mutations in atctf <dig>  we found that induction of rnai against atctf <dig> caused severe inhibition and defects in growth during vegetative and reproductive stages as well as sterility. atctf7-rnai plants displayed chromosome fragmentation and loss of sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis. immunostaining for the cohesion subunit atscc <dig> showed a marked reduction in association of cohesin with chromatin during meiosis in atctf7-rnai plants.


CONCLUSIONS
we find that atctf <dig> is essential for sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis in arabidopsis and is required for association of cohesin with chromatin in prophase of meiosis.
