BACKGROUND
de novo eukaryotic promoter prediction is important for discovering novel genes and understanding gene regulation. in spite of the great advances made in the past decade, recent studies revealed that the overall performances of the current promoter prediction programs  are still poor, and predictions made by individual ppps do not overlap each other. furthermore, most ppps are trained and tested on the most-upstream promoters; their performances on alternative promoters have not been assessed.


RESULTS
in this paper, we evaluate the performances of current major promoter prediction programs  using  <dig>  distinct human gene promoters on a genome-wide scale, and with emphasis on alternative promoters. we describe an artificial neural network  based meta-predictor program that integrates predictions from the current ppps and the predicted promoters' relation to cpg islands. our specific analysis of recently discovered alternative promoters reveals that although only 41% of the 3' most promoters overlap a cpg island, 74% of 5' most promoters overlap a cpg island.


CONCLUSIONS
our assessment of six ppps on  <dig>  Ã—  <dig> bps of human genome sequence reveals the specific strengths and weaknesses of individual ppps. our meta-predictor outperforms any individual ppp in sensitivity and specificity. furthermore, we discovered that the 5' alternative promoters are more likely to be associated with a cpg island.
