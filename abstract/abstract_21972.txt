BACKGROUND
tobacco smoke  contains highly reactive oxygen species , which cause oxidative damage in vascular tissue and may exacerbate inflammatory events leading to the blood-brain barrier damage  which accompanies the development of a variety of neurological disorders. smokers often have elevated leukocyte counts , and significant decreases in plasma alpha-tocopherol  and ascorbic acid  levels due to increased anti-oxidative mobilization in response to oxidative stress evoked by ts. for this purpose, using static culture systems and a well-established dynamic in vitro bbb model  we tested the hypothesis that antioxidant vitamin supplementation  can protect the bbb during exposure to whole soluble ts.


RESULTS
ts exacerbates inflammatory events and leads to endothelial overexpression of vascular adhesion molecules , release of pro-inflammatory cytokines  and nitric oxide , release and activation of matrix metalloproteinases , monocytic maturation into macrophages, and adhesion to the vascular endothelium. furthermore, ts altered the normal glucose metabolic behaviour of in vitro bbb capillaries and caused a period of transient anaerobic respiration to meet the cellular bioenergetic demand. pre-treatment with antioxidant vitamins  effectively reduced the pro-inflammatory activity associated with ts, protecting the viability and functions of the bbb.


CONCLUSIONS
our results have shown that loss of endothelial viability as well as bbb function and integrity caused by ts exposure can be prevented or at least reduced by normal physiologic concentrations of antioxidant vitamins in vitro.
