BACKGROUND
transcription factors  are vital elements that regulate transcription and the spatio-temporal expression of genes, thereby ensuring the accurate development and functioning of an organism. the identification of tf-encoding genes in a liverwort, marchantia polymorpha, offers insights into tf organization in the members of the most basal lineages of land plants . therefore, a comparison of marchantia tf genes with other land plants  and algae  provides the most comprehensive view of the rates of expansion or contraction of tf genes in plant evolution.


RESULTS
in this study, we report the identification of tf-encoding transcripts in m. polymorpha for the first time, as evidenced by deep rna sequencing data. in total,  <dig>  putative tf encoding transcripts, distributed in  <dig> families, were identified, representing  <dig> % of the generated marchantia gametophytic transcriptome dataset. overall, tf basic functions and distribution across families appear to be conserved when compared to other plant species. however, it is of interest to observe the genesis of novel sequences in  <dig> tf families and the apparent termination of  <dig> tf families with the emergence of marchantia. out of  <dig> tf families,  <dig> are known to be associated with plant reproductive development processes. we also examined the expression pattern of these tf-encoding transcripts in six male and female developmental stages in vegetative and reproductive gametophytic tissues of marchantia.


CONCLUSIONS
the analysis highlighted the importance of marchantia, a model plant system, in an evolutionary context. the dataset generated here provides a scientific resource for tf gene discovery and other comparative evolutionary studies of land plants.
