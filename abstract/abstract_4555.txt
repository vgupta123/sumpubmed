BACKGROUND
aluminium  toxicity is the main factor limiting the crop production in acid soils and barley  is one of the most al-sensitive of the small-grained cereals. the major gene for al tolerance in barley is hvaact <dig>  on chromosome 4h which encodes a multidrug and toxic compound extrusion  protein. the hvaact <dig> protein facilitates the al-activated release of citrate from root apices which protects the growing cells and enables root elongation to continue. a 1 kb transposable element-like insert in the 5’ untranslated region  of hvaact <dig> is associated with increased gene expression and tolerance and a pcr-based marker is available to score for this insertion.


RESULTS
we screened a wide range of barley genotypes for al tolerance and identified a moderately tolerant chinese genotype named cxhksl which did not show the typical allele in the 5’ utr of hvaact <dig> associated with tolerance. we investigated the mechanism of al tolerance in cxhksl and concluded it also relies on the al-activated release of citrate from roots. quantitative trait loci  analysis of double haploid lines generated with cxhksl and the al-sensitive variety gairdner mapped the tolerance locus to the same region as hvaact <dig> on chromosome 4h.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the chinese barley genotype cxhksl possesses a novel allele of the major al tolerance gene hvaact <dig>
