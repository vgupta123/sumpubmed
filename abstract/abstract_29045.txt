BACKGROUND
mangroves are ecologically important and highly threatened forest communities. observational and genetic evidence has confirmed the long distance dispersal capacity of water-dispersed mangrove seeds, but less is known about the relative importance of pollen vs. seed gene flow in connecting populations. we analyzed  <dig> avicennia germinans for  <dig> microsatellite loci and  <dig> rhizophora mangle for six microsatellite loci and subsampled two non-coding cpdna regions in order to understand population structure, and gene flow within and among four major estuaries on the caribbean and pacific coasts of panama.


RESULTS
both species showed similar rates of outcrossing  and strong patterns of spatial genetic structure within estuaries, although a. germinans had greater genetic structure in nuclear and cpdna markers , and much greater cpdna diversity  than r. mangle. the central american isthmus serves as an exceptionally strong barrier to gene flow, with high levels nuclear  and plastid  genetic differentiation observed within each species between coasts and no shared cpdna haplotypes between species on each coast. finally, evidence of low ratios of pollen to seed dispersal , coupled with the strong observed structure in nuclear and plastid dna among most estuaries, suggests low levels of gene flow in these mangrove species.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that gene dispersal in mangroves is usually limited within estuaries and that coastal geomorphology and rare long distance dispersal events could also influence levels of structure.
