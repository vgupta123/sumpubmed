BACKGROUND
many proteomics initiatives require integration of all information with uniformcriteria from collection of samples and data display to publication of experimental results. the integration and exchanging of these data of different formats and structure imposes a great challenge to us. the xml technology presents a promise in handling this task due to its simplicity and flexibility. nasopharyngeal carcinoma  is one of the most common cancers in southern china and southeast asia, which has marked geographic and racial differences in incidence. although there are some cancer proteome databases now, there is still no npc proteome database.


RESULTS
the raw npc proteome experiment data were captured into one xml document with human proteome markup language  editor and imported into native xml database xindice. the 2d/ms repository of npc proteome was constructed with apache, php and xindice to provide access to the database via internet. on our website, two methods, keyword query and click query, were provided at the same time to access the entries of the npc proteome database.


CONCLUSIONS
our 2d/ms repository can be used to share the raw npc proteomics data that are generated from gel-based proteomics experiments. the database, as well as the php source codes for constructing users' own proteome repository, can be accessed at .
