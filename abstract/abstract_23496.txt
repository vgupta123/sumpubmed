BACKGROUND
parkinson's disease, for which currently there is no cure, develops as a result of progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the brain; thus, identification of any potential therapeutic intervention for disease management is of a great importance.


RESULTS
here we report that prophylactic application of water-soluble formulation of coenzyme q <dig> could effectively offset the effects of environmental neurotoxin paraquat, believed to be a contributing factor in the development of familial pd. in this study we utilized a model of paraquat-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in adult rats that received three weekly intra-peritoneal injections of the herbicide paraquat. histological and biochemical analyses of rat brains revealed increased levels of oxidative stress markers and a loss of approximately 65% of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra region. the paraquat-exposed rats also displayed impaired balancing skills on a slowly rotating drum  evidenced by their reduced spontaneity in gait performance. in contrast, paraquat exposed rats receiving a water-soluble formulation of coenzyme q <dig> in their drinking water prior to and during the paraquat treatment neither developed neurodegeneration nor reduced rotorod performance and were indistinguishable from the control paraquat-untreated rats.


CONCLUSIONS
our data confirmed that paraquat-induced neurotoxicity represents a convenient rat model of parkinsonian neurodegeneration suitable for mechanistic and neuroprotective studies. this is the first preclinical evaluation of a water-soluble coenzyme q <dig> formulation showing the evidence of prophylactic neuroprotection at clinically relevant doses.
