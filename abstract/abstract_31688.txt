BACKGROUND
distinguishing the recent introduction of quinolone resistant gonococci into a population from diversification of resistant strains already in the population is important for planning effective infection control strategies. we applied molecular evolutionary analyses to dna sequences from  <dig> housekeeping genes and gyra, parc and porb of  <dig> quinolone resistant n. gonorrhoeae  and  <dig> quinolone sensitive isolates collected in israel during 2000â€“ <dig> 


RESULTS
phylogenetic and eburst analyses and estimates of divergence time indicated qrng were introduced on  <dig> separate occasions and underwent limited diversification by mutation, deletion and horizontal gene transfer. reconstruction of n. gonorrhoeae demography showed a slowly declining effective strain population size from  <dig> to  <dig>  rapid decline between  <dig> and  <dig>  and an increase from  <dig> to  <dig>  this is partially attributable to declining gonorrhea case rates from  <dig> to  <dig>  additional contributing factors are selective sweeps of antibiotic resistant gonococci and increased transmission from sex workers. the abrupt decline in the mid-1990s heralded an increased incidence of gonorrhea from  <dig> to the present. the subsequent increase in effective strain population size since  <dig> reflects the increased gonococcal census population and introduction of quinolone resistance strains.


CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates the effective use of population genetic approaches to assess recent and historical population dynamics of n. gonorrhoeae.
