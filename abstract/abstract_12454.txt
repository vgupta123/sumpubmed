BACKGROUND
the atypical cadherin protein cadherin  <dig>  is crucial for proper function of retinal photoreceptors and inner ear hair cells. as we obtain more and more information about the specific roles of cadherin  <dig> in photoreceptors and hair cells, the regulatory mechanisms responsible for the transport of this protein to the plasma membrane are largely unknown.


RESULTS
pist, a golgi-associated, pdz domain-containing protein, interacted with cadherin  <dig> via the pdz domain of pist and the c-terminal pdz domain-binding interface  of cadherin  <dig>  by binding to cadherin  <dig>  pist retained cadherin  <dig> in the trans-golgi network of cultured cells. the retention was released when either of the two known cadherin 23-binding proteins magi- <dig> and harmonin was co-expressed. similar to magi- <dig> and harmonin, pist was detected in mouse inner ear sensory hair cells.


CONCLUSIONS
pist binds cadherin  <dig> via its pdz domain and retains cadherin  <dig> in trans-golgi network. magi- <dig> and harmonin can compete with pist for binding cadherin  <dig> and release cadherin  <dig> from pist's retention. our finding suggests that pist, magi- <dig> and harmonin collaborate in intracellular trafficking of cadherin  <dig> and regulate the plasma membrane expression of cadherin  <dig>
