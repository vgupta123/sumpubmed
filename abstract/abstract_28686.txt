BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile is a gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium that is responsible for c. difficile associated disease in humans and is currently the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhoea in the western world. this current status has been linked to the emergence of a highly virulent pcr-ribotype  <dig> strain. the aim of this work was to identify regions of sequence divergence that may be used as genetic markers of hypervirulent pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains and markers of the sequenced strain, cd <dig> by array comparative hybridisation.


RESULTS
in this study, we examined  <dig> clinical strains of the most common pcr-ribotypes isolated in mainland europe and the uk by array comparative genomic hybridisation. our array was comprehensive with  <dig>  oligonucleotides covering the c. difficile  <dig> genome and revealed a core genome for all the strains of 32%. the array also covered genes unique to two pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains, relative to c. difficile  <dig> which were represented by  <dig> probes. all of these genes were also found in the commonly occuring pcr-ribotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  and the emerging hypervirulent pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains, indicating that these are markers for all highly virulent strains.


CONCLUSIONS
we have fulfilled the aims of this study by identifying markers for cd <dig> and markers associated with hypervirulence, albeit genes that are not just indicative of pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains. we have also extended this study and have defined a more stringent core gene set compared to those previously published due to the comprehensive array coverage. further to this we have defined a list of genes absent from non-toxinogenic strains and defined the nature of the specific toxin deletion in the strain cd <dig>
