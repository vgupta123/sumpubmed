BACKGROUND
oil in the form of triacylglycerols  is quantitatively the most important storage form of energy for eukaryotic cells. diacylglycerol acyltransferase  is considered the rate-limiting enzyme for tag accumulation. chlorella, a unicellular eukaryotic green alga, has attracted much attention as a potential feedstock for renewable energy production. however, the function of dgat <dig> in chlorella has not been reported.


RESULTS
a full-length cdna encoding a putative diacylglycerol acyltransferase  <dig>  was obtained from chlorella ellipsoidea. the  <dig>  bp open reading frame of this cdna, designated cedgat <dig>  encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids showing no more than 40% identity with dgat1s of higher plants. transcript analysis showed that the expression level of cedgat <dig> markedly increased under nitrogen starvation, which led to significant triacylglycerol  accumulation. cedgat <dig> activity was confirmed in the yeast quadruple mutant strain h <dig> by restoring its ability to produce tag. upon expression of cedgat <dig>  the total fatty acid content in wild-type yeast  increased by 142%, significantly higher than that transformed with dgat1s from higher plants, including even the oil crop soybean. the over-expression of cedgat <dig> under the nos promoter in wild-type arabidopsis thaliana and brassica napus var. westar significantly increased the oil content by 8–37% and 12–18% and the average  <dig> -seed weight by 9–15% and 6–29%, respectively, but did not alter the fatty acid composition of the seed oil. the net increase in the  <dig> -seed total lipid content was up to 25–50% in both transgenic arabidopsis and b. napus.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified a gene encoding dgat <dig> in c. ellipsoidea and confirmed that it plays an important role in tag accumulation. this is the first functional analysis of dgat <dig> in chlorella. this information is important for understanding lipid synthesis and accumulation in chlorella and for genetic engineering to enhance oil production in microalgae and oil plants.
