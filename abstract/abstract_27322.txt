BACKGROUND
in recent years novel human respiratory disease agents have been described for southeast asia and australia. the causative pathogens were classified as pteropine orthoreoviruses with a strong phylogenetic relationship to orthoreoviruses of bat origin.


RESULTS
in this report, we isolated a novel melaka-like reovirus  from intestinal content samples of one fruit bat residing in china’s yunnan province. phylogenetic analysis of the whole cangyuan virus genome sequences of segments l, m and s demonstrated the genetic diversity of the cangyuan virus. in contrast to the l and m segments, the phylogenetic trees for the s segments of cangyuan virus demonstrated a greater degree of heterogeneity.


CONCLUSIONS
phylogenetic analysis indicated that the cangyuan virus was a novel orthoreovirus and substantially different from currently known members of pteropine orthoreovirus  species group.
