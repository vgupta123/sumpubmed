BACKGROUND
recovering high quality intact rna from post-mortem tissue is of major concern for gene expression studies in animals and humans. since the availability of post-mortem tissue is often associated with substantial delay, it is important that we understand the temporal variation in the stability of total rna and of individual gene transcripts so as to be able to appropriately interpret the data generated from such studies. hence, the objective of this experiment was to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the integrity of total and messenger rna extracted from bovine skeletal muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue and liver stored at 4Â°c at a range of time points up to  <dig> days post-mortem. these conditions were designed to mimic the environment prevailing during the transport of beef from the abattoir to retail outlets.


RESULTS
the 28s and 18s rrna molecules of total rna were intact for up to  <dig> h post-mortem in liver and adipose tissues and up to  <dig> days post-mortem in skeletal muscle. the mrna of housekeeping genes  and two diet-related genes  were detectable up to  <dig> days post-mortem in skeletal muscle. while the mrna stability of the two housekeeping genes was different in skeletal muscle and liver, they were similar to each other in adipose tissue. after  <dig> days post-mortem, the relative abundance of rbp <dig> gene was increased in skeletal muscle and in adipose tissue and decreased in liver. during this period, the relative abundance of scd gene also increased in skeletal muscle whereas it decreased in both adipose tissue and liver.


CONCLUSIONS
stability of rna in three tissues  subjected to long-term post-mortem storage at refrigeration temperature indicated that skeletal muscle can be a suitable tissue for recovering biologically useful rna for gene expression studies even if the tissue is subjected to post-mortem storage for weeks, whereas adipose tissue and liver should be processed within  <dig> hours post-mortem.
