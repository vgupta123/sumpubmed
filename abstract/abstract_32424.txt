BACKGROUND
there is increasing evidence that bacterial infection of the intestinal mucosa may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases . in pigs, an obligate intracellular bacterium, lawsonia intracellularis , was shown to cause proliferative enteropathy  of which some forms display histological and clinical similarities to human ibd. since li-similar desulfovibrio spp. may infect human cells, we hypothesized that li might be associated with the development of human ibd.


RESULTS
in human intestinal tissue samples, pcr using llg, 50sl <dig>  lsa and strictly li-specific 16sii primers, yielded either no amplicons or products with weak homology to human genomic sequences. sequencing of these amplicons revealed no specificity for li. however, amplification of dna with less specific 16si primers resulted in products bearing homology to certain streptococcus species. these 16si-amplified products were present in healthy and diseased specimens, without obvious prevalence.


CONCLUSIONS
li is not associated with the pathogenesis of uc or cd. whether an immunologic response to commensal bacteria such as streptococci may contribute to the chronic inflammatory condition in ibd, remained to be determined.
