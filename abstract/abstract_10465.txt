BACKGROUND
plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria are increasingly being seen as a way of complementing conventional inputs in agricultural systems. the effects on their host plants are diverse and include volatile-mediated growth enhancement. this study sought to assess the effects of bacterial volatiles on the biomass production and root system architecture of the model grass brachypodium distachyon  beauv.


RESULTS
an in vitro experiment allowing plant-bacteria interaction throughout the gaseous phase without any physical contact was used to screen  <dig> bacterial strains for their growth-promotion ability over a 10-day co-cultivation period. five groups of bacteria were defined and characterised based on their combined influence on biomass production and root system architecture. the observed effects ranged from unchanged to greatly increased biomass production coupled with increased root length and branching. primary root length was increased only by the volatile compounds emitted by enterobacter cloacae jm <dig> and bacillus pumilus t <dig>  overall, the most significant results were obtained with bacillus subtilis gb <dig>  which induced an 81 % increase in total biomass, as well as enhancing total root length, total secondary root length and total adventitious root length by  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first report on bacterial volatile-mediated growth promotion of a grass plant. contrasting modulations of biomass production coupled with changes in root system architecture were observed. most of the strains that increased total plant biomass also modulated adventitious root growth. under our screening conditions, total biomass production was strongly correlated with the length and branching of the root system components, except for primary root length. an analysis of the emission kinetics of the bacterial volatile compounds is being undertaken and should lead to the identification of the compounds responsible for the observed growth-promotion effects. within the context of the inherent characteristics of our in vitro system, this paper identifies the next critical experimental steps and discusses them from both a fundamental and an applied perspective.
