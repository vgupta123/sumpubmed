BACKGROUND
alpha -hemolysin is a pore forming cytolysin and serves as a virulence factor in intestinal and extraintestinal pathogenic strains of e. coli. it was suggested that the genes encoding α-hemolysin  which can be found on the chromosome and plasmid, were acquired through horizontal gene transfer. plasmid-encoded α-hly is associated with certain enterotoxigenic , shigatoxigenic  and enteropathogenic e. coli  strains. in uropathogenic e. coli , the α-hly genes are located on chromosomal pathogenicity islands. previous work suggested that plasmid and chromosomally encoded α-hly may have evolved independently. this was explored in our study.


RESULTS
we have investigated  <dig> α-hly plasmids from animal and human etec, stec and epec strains. the size of α-hly plasmids ranges from 48- <dig> kb and eight plasmids are conjugative. the regulatory gene  located upstream of the hlycabd gene operon and an is <dig> element located downstream of hlyd are conserved. chromosomally-encoded α-hly operons lack the hlyr and is <dig> elements. the dna sequence of hlyc and hlya divided the plasmid- and chromosomally-encoded α-hemolysins into two clusters. the plasmid-encoded α-hly genes could be further divided into three groups based on the insertion of is <dig> and is <dig> in the regulatory region upstream of the α-hly operon. transcription of the hlya gene was higher than the housekeeping icda gene in all strains . nucleotide sequence analysis of a chromosomally located α-hly determinant in enterobacter cloacae strain indicates that it originates from an e. coli α-hly plasmid.


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that plasmids encoding α-hly in e. coli descended from a common ancestor independent of the plasmid size and the origin of the strains. conjugative plasmids could contribute to the spread of the α-hly determinant to enterobacter cloacae. the presence of is-elements flanking the plasmid-encoded α-hly indicate that they might be mobile genetic elements.
