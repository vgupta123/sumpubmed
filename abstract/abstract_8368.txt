BACKGROUND
building reference libraries of dna barcodes is relatively straightforward when specifically designed primers are available to amplify the coi-5p region from a relatively narrow taxonomic group . dna barcoding marine communities have been comparatively harder to accomplish due to the broad taxonomic diversity and lack of consistently efficient primers. although some of the so-called “universal” primers have been relatively successful, they still fail to amplify coi-5p of many marine animal groups, while displaying random success even among species within each group. here we propose a new pair of primers designed to enhance amplification of the coi-5p region in a wide range of marine organisms.


RESULTS
amplification tests conducted on a wide range of marine animal taxa, rendered possible the first–time sequencing of dna barcodes from eight separated phyla , comprising a total of  <dig> classes,  <dig> orders,  <dig> families,  <dig> genus and  <dig> species.


CONCLUSIONS
these primers demonstrated to be highly cost-effective, which is of key importance for dna barcoding procedures, such as for building comprehensive dna barcode libraries of marine communities, where the processing of a large numbers of specimens from a wide variety of marine taxa is compulsory.
