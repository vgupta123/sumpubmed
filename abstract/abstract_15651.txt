BACKGROUND
in the research on protein functional sites, researchers often need to identify binding-site residues on a protein. a commonly used strategy is to find a complex structure from the protein data bank  that consists of the protein of interest and its interacting partner and calculate binding-site residues based on the complex structure. however, since a protein may participate in multiple interactions, the binding-site residues calculated based on one complex structure usually do not reveal all binding sites on a protein. thus, this requires researchers to find all pdb complexes that contain the protein of interest and combine the binding-site information gleaned from them. this process is very time-consuming. especially, combing binding-site information obtained from different pdb structures requires tedious work to align protein sequences. the process becomes overwhelmingly difficult when researchers have a large set of proteins to analyze, which is usually the case in practice.


RESULTS
in this study, we have developed a tool for calculating binding-site residues on proteins, tcbrp . for an input protein, tcbrp can quickly find all binding-site residues on the protein by automatically combining the information obtained from all pdb structures that consist of the protein of interest. additionally, tcbrp presents the binding-site residues in different categories according to the interaction type. tcbrp also allows researchers to set the definition of binding-site residues.


CONCLUSIONS
the developed tool is very useful for the research on protein binding site analysis and prediction.
