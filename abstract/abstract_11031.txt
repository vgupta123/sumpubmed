BACKGROUND
it has been suggested that glutamatergic system hyperactivity may be related to the pathogenesis of parkinson’s disease . vesicular glutamate transporters  import glutamate into synaptic vesicles and are key anatomical and functional markers of glutamatergic excitatory transmission. both vglut <dig> and vglut <dig> have been identified as definitive markers of glutamatergic neurons, but vglut  <dig> is also expressed by non glutamatergic neurons. vglut <dig> and vglut <dig> are thought to be expressed in a complementary manner in the cortex and the thalamus , in glutamatergic neurons involved in different physiological functions. chronic high-frequency stimulation  of the subthalamic nucleus  is the neurosurgical therapy of choice for the management of motor deficits in patients with advanced pd. stn-hfs is highly effective, but its mechanisms of action remain unclear. this study examines the effect of stn-hfs on vglut1- <dig> expression in different brain nuclei involved in motor circuits, namely the basal ganglia  network, in normal and 6-hydroxydopamine  lesioned rats.


RESULTS
here we report that: 1) dopamine-depletion did not affect vglut <dig> and vglut <dig> expression but significantly decreased that of vglut <dig> in almost all bg structures studied; 2) stn-hfs did not change vglut1- <dig> expression in the different brain areas of normal rats while, on the contrary, it systematically induced a significant increase of their expression in da-depleted rats and 3) stn-hfs reversed the decrease in vglut <dig> expression induced by the da-depletion.


CONCLUSIONS
these results show for the first time a comparative analysis of changes of expression for the three vgluts induced by stn-hfs in the bg network of normal and hemiparkinsonian rats. they provide evidence for the involvement of vglut <dig> in the modulation of bg cicuits and in particular that of thalamostriatal and thalamocortical pathways suggesting their key role in its therapeutic effects for alleviating pd motor symptoms.
