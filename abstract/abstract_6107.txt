BACKGROUND
glutamic peptidases, from the merops family g <dig>  are a distinct group of peptidases characterized by a catalytic dyad consisting of a glutamate and a glutamine residue, optimal activity at acidic ph and insensitivity towards the microbial derived protease inhibitor, pepstatin. previously, only glutamic peptidases derived from filamentous fungi have been characterized.


RESULTS
we report the first characterization of a bacterial glutamic peptidase , derived from the thermoacidophilic bacteria alicyclobacillus sp. dsm  <dig>  the amino acid sequence identity between pepg <dig> and known fungal glutamic peptidases is only 24-30% but homology modeling, the presence of the glutamate/glutamine catalytic dyad and a number of highly conserved motifs strongly support the inclusion of pepg <dig> as a glutamic peptidase. phylogenetic analysis places pepg <dig> and other putative bacterial and archaeal glutamic peptidases in a cluster separate from the fungal glutamic peptidases, indicating a divergent and independent evolution of bacterial and fungal glutamic peptidases. purification of pepg <dig>  heterologously expressed in bacillus subtilis, was performed using hydrophobic interaction chromatography and ion exchange chromatography. the purified peptidase was characterized with respect to its physical properties. temperature and ph optimums were found to be 60Â°c and ph 3- <dig>  in agreement with the values observed for the fungal members of family g <dig>  in addition, pepg <dig> was found to be pepstatin-insensitive, a characteristic signature of glutamic peptidases.


CONCLUSIONS
based on the obtained results, we suggest that pepg <dig> can be added to the merops family g <dig> as the first characterized bacterial member.
