BACKGROUND
combinatorial regulation of transcription factors  is important in determining the complex gene expression patterns particularly in higher organisms. deciphering regulatory rules between cooperative tfs is a critical step towards understanding the mechanisms of combinatorial regulation.


RESULTS
we present here a bayesian network approach called gbnet to search for dna motifs that may be cooperative in transcriptional regulation and the sequence constraints that these motifs may satisfy. we showed that gbnet outperformed the other available methods in the simulated and the yeast data. we also demonstrated the usefulness of gbnet on learning regulatory rules between yy <dig>  a human tf, and its co-factors. most of the rules learned by gbnet on yy <dig> and co-factors were supported by literature. in addition, a spacing constraint between yy <dig> and e2f was also supported by independent tf binding experiments.


CONCLUSIONS
we thus conclude that gbnet is a useful tool for deciphering the "grammar" of transcriptional regulation.
