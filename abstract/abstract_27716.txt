BACKGROUND
the liver is the largest human internal organ â€“ it is composed of multiple cell types and plays a vital role in fulfilling the body's metabolic needs and maintaining homeostasis. of these cell types the hepatocytes, which account for three-quarters of the liver's volume, perform its main functions. to discover the molecular basis of hepatocyte function, we employed massively parallel signature sequencing  to determine the transcriptomic profile of adult human hepatocytes obtained by laser capture microdissection .


RESULTS
 <dig>  unigene clusters, representing  <dig>  known genes, were detected in human hepatocytes. in addition,  <dig>  unique mpss signatures matching the antisense strand of  <dig>  non-redundant unigene clusters  were highly expressed in hepatocytes.


CONCLUSIONS
apart from a large number of protein-coding genes, some of the antisense transcripts expressed in hepatocytes could play important roles in transcriptional interference via a cis-/trans-regulation mechanism. our result provided a comprehensively transcriptomic atlas of human hepatocytes using mpss technique, which could be served as an available resource for an in-depth understanding of human liver biology and diseases.
