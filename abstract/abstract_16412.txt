BACKGROUND
in this study we employed the tap tag purification method coupled with mass spectrometry analysis to identify proteins that co-purify with escherichia coli rnase r during exponential growth and after temperature downshift.


RESULTS
our initial results suggested that rnase r can interact with bacterial ribosomes. we subsequently confirmed this result using sucrose gradient ribosome profiling joined with western blot analysis. we found that rnase r co-migrates with the single 30s ribosomal subunits. independent data involving rnase r in the rrna quality control process allowed us to hypothesize that the rnase r connection with ribosomes has an important physiological role.


CONCLUSIONS
this study leads us to conclude that rnase r can interact with ribosomal proteins and that this interaction may be a result of this enzyme involvement in the ribosome quality control.
