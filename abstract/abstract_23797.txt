BACKGROUND
recently it has been shown that ensifer adhaerens can be used as a plant transformation technology, transferring genes into several plant genomes when equipped with a ti plasmid. for this study, we have sequenced the genome of ensifer adhaerens ov <dig>  and compared it with those of agrobacterium tumefaciens c <dig>  and sinorhizobium meliloti  <dig> ; the latter of which has also demonstrated a capacity to genetically transform crop genomes, albeit at significantly reduced frequencies.


RESULTS
the  <dig> Â mb ov <dig> genome comprises two chromosomes and two plasmids. all protein coding regions in the ov <dig> genome were functionally grouped based on an eggnog database. no genes homologous to the a. tumefaciens ti plasmid vir genes appeared to be present in the ov <dig> genome. unexpectedly, ov <dig> and  <dig> were found to possess homologs to chromosomal based genes cited as essential to a. tumefaciens t-dna transfer. of significance, genes that are non-essential but exert a positive influence on virulence and the ability to genetically transform host genomes were identified in ov <dig> but were absent from the  <dig> genome.


CONCLUSIONS
this study reveals the presence of homologs to chromosomally based agrobacterium genes that support t-dna transfer within the genome of ov <dig> and other alphaproteobacteria. the sequencing and analysis of the ov <dig> genome increases our understanding of t-dna transfer by non-agrobacterium species and creates a platform for the continued improvement of ensifer-mediated transformation .
