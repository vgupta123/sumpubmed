BACKGROUND
the theoretical basis of genome-wide association studies  is statistical inference of linkage disequilibrium  between any polymorphic marker and a putative disease locus. most methods widely implemented for such analyses are vulnerable to several key demographic factors and deliver a poor statistical power for detecting genuine associations and also a high false positive rate. here, we present a likelihood-based statistical approach that accounts properly for non-random nature of case–control samples in regard of genotypic distribution at the loci in populations under study and confers flexibility to test for genetic association in presence of different confounding factors such as population structure, non-randomness of samples etc.


RESULTS
we implemented this novel method together with several popular methods in the literature of gwas, to re-analyze recently published parkinson’s disease  case–control samples. the real data analysis and computer simulation show that the new method confers not only significantly improved statistical power for detecting the associations but also robustness to the difficulties stemmed from non-randomly sampling and genetic structures when compared to its rivals. in particular, the new method detected  <dig> significant snps within  <dig> chromosomal regions of size < 1 mb but only  <dig> snps in two of these regions were previously detected by the trend test based methods. it discovered two snps located  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb from the pd candidates, fgf <dig> and park <dig>  without invoking false positive risk.


CONCLUSIONS
we developed a novel likelihood-based method which provides adequate estimation of ld and other population model parameters by using case and control samples, the ease in integration of these samples from multiple genetically divergent populations and thus confers statistically robust and powerful analyses of gwas. on basis of simulation studies and analysis of real datasets, we demonstrated significant improvement of the new method over the non-parametric trend test, which is the most popularly implemented in the literature of gwas.
