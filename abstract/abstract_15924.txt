BACKGROUND
second-generation sequencing has the potential to revolutionize genomics and impact all areas of biomedical science. new technologies will make re-sequencing widely available for such applications as identifying genome variations or interrogating the oligonucleotide content of a large sample . the increase in speed, sensitivity and availability of sequencing technology brings demand for advances in computational technology to perform associated analysis tasks. the solexa/illumina 1g sequencer can produce tens of millions of reads, ranging in length from ~25â€“ <dig> nt, in a single experiment. accurately mapping the reads back to a reference genome is a critical task in almost all applications. two sources of information that are often ignored when mapping reads from the solexa technology are the 3' ends of longer reads, which contain a much higher frequency of sequencing errors, and the base-call quality scores.


RESULTS
to investigate whether these sources of information can be used to improve accuracy when mapping reads, we developed the rmap tool, which can map reads having a wide range of lengths and allows base-call quality scores to determine which positions in each read are more important when mapping. we applied rmap to analyze data re-sequenced from two human bac regions for varying read lengths, and varying criteria for use of quality scores. rmap is freely available for downloading at .


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that significant gains in solexa read mapping performance can be achieved by considering the information in 3' ends of longer reads, and appropriately using the base-call quality scores. the rmap tool we have developed will enable researchers to effectively exploit this information in targeted re-sequencing projects.
