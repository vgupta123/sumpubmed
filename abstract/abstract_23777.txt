BACKGROUND
monocytes represent a heterogeneous population of cells subdivided according to the expression level of membrane antigens. a pro-inflammatory  subpopulation of monocytes is defined by expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig> seems to be characteristically preferentially expressed by immunosuppressive monocytes. the aim of our study was to evaluate the distribution of monocyte subpopulations in  <dig> patients with kidney allograft transplantation.


RESULTS
the phenotype was evaluated by flow cytometry in defined time points. the proportions of peripheral cd14+cd16+ monocytes were downregulated immediately after the kidney transplantation and basiliximab treatment partially attenuated this trend. the transient downregulation of the cd14+cd16+ subpopulation was adjusted to basal values in two months. the proportions of cd14+cd163+ monocytes were transiently upregulated early after the kidney transplantation and remained higher during the first month in most patients. in atg treated patients, the expansion of cd14+cd163+ monocytes was delayed but their upregulation lasted longer. in vitro data showed the direct effect of atg and methylprednisolone on expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> molecules while basiliximab did not affect the phenotype of cultured monocytes.


CONCLUSIONS
we assume from our data that kidney allograft transplantation is associated with modulation of monocyte subpopulations  partially affected by an immunosuppressive regime used.
