BACKGROUND
it is well known that carbohydrates play fundamental roles in cell signaling and infection processes as well as tumor formation and progression. however, the interaction pathways and cellular receptors targeted by carbohydrates and glycoconjugates remain poorly examined and understood. this lack of research stems, at least to a major part, from accessibility problems of large, branched oligosaccharides.


RESULTS
to test glycan - cell interactions in vitro, a variety of tailored oligosaccharides was synthesized chemo-enzymatically. glycosyltransferases from the gras organisms bacillus megaterium  and aspergillus niger  were used in this study. substrate engineering of these glycosyltransferases generally acting on sucrose leads to the controlled formation of novel tailored di-, tri- and tetrasaccharides. already industrially used as prebiotics in functional food, the immunogenic potential of novel oligosaccharides was characterized in this study. a differential secretion of cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> was observed upon oligosaccharide co-cultivation with colorectal epithelial caco- <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
pure carbohydrates are able to stimulate a cytokine response in human endothelial cells in vitro. the type and amount of cytokine secretion depends on the type of co-cultivated oligosaccharide.
