BACKGROUND
disulfide bonds play an important role in protein folding and structure stability. accurately predicting disulfide bonds from protein sequences is important for modeling the structural and functional characteristics of many proteins.

methods
in this work, we introduce an approach of enhancing disulfide bonding prediction accuracy by taking advantage of context-based features. we firstly derive the first-order and second-order mean-force potentials according to the amino acid environment around the cysteine residues from large number of cysteine samples. the mean-force potentials are integrated as context-based scores to estimate the favorability of a cysteine residue in disulfide bonding state as well as a cysteine pair in disulfide bond connectivity. these context-based scores are then incorporated as features together with other sequence and evolutionary information to train neural networks for disulfide bonding state prediction and connectivity prediction.


RESULTS
the 10-fold cross validated accuracy is  <dig> % at residue-level and  <dig> % at protein-level in classifying an individual cysteine residue as bonded or free, which is around 2% accuracy improvement. the average accuracy for disulfide bonding connectivity prediction is also improved, which yields overall sensitivity of  <dig> % and specificity of  <dig> %.


CONCLUSIONS
our computational results have shown that the context-based scores are effective features to enhance the prediction accuracies of both disulfide bonding state prediction and connectivity prediction. our disulfide prediction algorithm is implemented on a web server named "dinosolve" available at: http://hpcr.cs.odu.edu/dinosolve.
