BACKGROUND
the observation that specific members of the microbial intestinal community can be shared among vertebrate hosts has promoted the concept of a core microbiota whose composition is determined by host-specific selection. most studies investigating this concept in individual hosts have focused on mammals, yet the diversity of fish lineages provides unique comparative opportunities from an evolutionary, immunological and environmental perspective. here we describe microbial intestinal communities of eleven individual atlantic cod  caught at a single location based on an extensively  <dig> sequenced 16s rrna library of the v <dig> region.


RESULTS
we obtained a total of  <dig> sequences and identify  <dig> operational taxonomic units  at 97% sequence similarity level, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> otus per individual. we find that ten otus are shared, though the number of reads of these otus is highly variable. this variation is further illustrated by community diversity estimates that fluctuate several orders of magnitude among specimens. the shared otus belong to the orders of vibrionales, which quantitatively dominate the atlantic cod intestinal microbiota, followed by variable numbers of bacteroidales, erysipelotrichales, clostridiales, alteromonadales and deferribacterales.


CONCLUSIONS
the microbial intestinal community composition varies significantly in individual atlantic cod specimens caught at a single location. this high variation among specimens suggests that a complex combination of factors influence the species distribution of these intestinal communities.
