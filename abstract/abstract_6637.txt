BACKGROUND
s. oneidensis mr- <dig> is a dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium. under anoxic conditions s. oneidensis mr- <dig> attaches to and uses insoluble minerals such as fe and mn oxides as electron acceptors. in the laboratory, s. oneidensis mr- <dig> forms biofilms under hydrodynamic flow conditions on a borosilicate glass surface; formation of biofilms was previously found to be dependent on the mxd gene cluster .


RESULTS
this study revealed environmental and genetic factors regulating expression of the mxd genes in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  physiological experiments conducted with a s. oneidensis mr- <dig> strain carrying a transcriptional lacz fusion to the mxd promoter identified electron donor starvation as a key factor inducing mxd gene expression. tn <dig> mutagenesis identified the arcs/arca two-component signaling system as a repressor of mxd expression in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> under planktonic conditions. biofilms of ∆arcs and ∆arca strains carrying a transcriptional gfp -reporter fused to the mxd promoter revealed a reduced mxd expression, suggesting that arcs/arca are necessary for activation of mxd expression under biofilm conditions. biofilms of ∆arcs and ∆arca mutants were unable to form a compact three-dimensional structure consistent with a low level of mxd expression. in addition, bara/uvry was identified as a major regulator of mxd expression under planktonic conditions. interestingly, biofilms of ∆bara and ∆uvry mutants were able to form three-dimensional structures that were, however, less compact compared to wild type biofilms.


CONCLUSIONS
we have shown here that the mxd genes in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> are controlled transcriptionally in response to carbon starvation and by the arcs/arca and the bara/uvry signaling system. bara might function as a sensor to assess the metabolic state of the cell, including carbon starvation, leading to expression of the mxd operon and therefore control biofilm formation.
