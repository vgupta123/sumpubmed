BACKGROUND
streptococcus suis is a major problem in the swine industry causing meningitis, arthritis and pericarditis in piglets. pathogenesis of s. suis is poorly understood. we previously showed that introduction of a 3 kb genomic fragment from virulent serotype  <dig> strain  <dig> into a weakly virulent serotype  <dig> strain s <dig>  generated a hypervirulent isolate. the 3 kb genomic fragment contained two complete open reading frames  in an operon-structure of which one orf showed similarity to folylpolyglutamate synthetase, whereas the function of the second orf could not be predicted based on database searches for protein similarity.


RESULTS
in this study we demonstrate that introduction of orf <dig> from strain  <dig> into strain s <dig> is sufficient to dramatically increase the virulence of s <dig> in pigs. this increase in virulence could not be associated with changes in pro-inflammatory responses of porcine blood mononucleated cells in response to s. suis in vitro. sequence analysis of the orf2-folc-operon of s. suis isolates  <dig> and s <dig> revealed an snp in the − <dig> region of the putative promoter sequence of the operon, as well as several snps resulting in amino acid substitutions in the orf <dig> protein. transcript levels of orf <dig> and folc were significantly higher in the virulent strain  <dig> than in the weakly virulent strain s <dig> and in vitro mutagenesis of the orf <dig> promoter confirmed that this was due to a snp in the predicted − <dig> region upstream of the orf <dig> promoter. in this study, we demonstrated that the stronger promoter was present in all virulent and highly virulent s. suis isolates included in our study. this highlights a correlation between high orf <dig> expression and virulence. conversely, the weaker promoter was present in isolates known to be weakly pathogenic or non-pathogenic.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we demonstrate the importance of orf <dig> in the virulence of s. suis.
