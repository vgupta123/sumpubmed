BACKGROUND
non-coding rnas  are emerging as key regulators of many cellular processes in both physiological and pathological states. moreover, the constant discovery of new non-coding rna species suggests that the study of their complex functions is still in its very early stages. this variegated class of rna species encompasses the well-known micrornas  and the most recently acknowledged long non-coding rnas . interestingly, in the last couple of years, a few studies have shown that some lncrnas can act as mirna sponges, i.e. as competing endogenous rnas , able to reduce the amount of mirnas available to target messenger rnas .


RESULTS
we propose a computational approach to explore the ability of lncrnas to act as cernas by protecting mrnas from mirna repression. a seed match analysis was performed to validate the underlying regression model. we built normal and cancer networks of mirna-mediated sponge interactions  using breast cancer expression data provided by the cancer genome atlas.


CONCLUSIONS
our study highlights a marked rewiring in the cerna program between normal and pathological breast tissue, documented by its “on/off” switch from normal to cancer, and vice-versa. this mutually exclusive activation confers an interesting character to cernas as potential oncosuppressive, or oncogenic, protagonists in cancer. at the heart of this phenomenon is the lncrna pvt <dig>  as illustrated by both the width of its antagonist mrnas in normal-mmi-network, and the relevance of the latter in breast cancer. interestingly, pvt <dig> revealed a net binding preference towards the mir- <dig> family as the bone of contention with its rival mrnas.
