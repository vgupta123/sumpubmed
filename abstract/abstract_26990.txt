BACKGROUND
organic solute carrier partner  <dig>  is known to facilitate the transport of various organic solutes into cells and reported to play a role in cell growth and cell differentiation. moreover, oscp <dig> is known as a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently down-expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinomas and acute myeloid leukemia. however, the underlying mechanisms of action remain unclear and the subcellular localization of oscp <dig> has yet to be determined in detail.


RESULTS
drosophila contains a single orthologue of oscp <dig>  that shares 58% homology with its human counterpart. to study the expression pattern and subcellular localization of doscp <dig>  we prepared a specific antibody. subcellular localization analyses of doscp <dig> with these revealed localization in the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus and mitochondria, but no detection in cytosol. doscp <dig> signals were also detected in the nucleus, although at weaker intensity than in plasma membranes and subcellular organelles. in addition, native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis with and without Î²-mercaptoethanol treatment revealed that recombinant doscp <dig> forms dimers and trimers in solution. the dimer form of doscp <dig> could also be detected by western immunoblot analyses in third instar larval extracts.


CONCLUSIONS
the data revealed that doscp <dig> localizes not only in the plasma membrane but also in the nucleus, er, golgi apparatus and mitochondria. it is therefore conceivable that this protein may interact with various partners or form multimeric complexes with other proteins to play multiple roles in cells, providing clues to understanding the functions of doscp <dig> during drosophila development.
