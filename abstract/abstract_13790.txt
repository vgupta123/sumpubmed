BACKGROUND
centromeres are sites of chromosomal spindle attachment during mitosis and meiosis. while the sequence basis for centromere identity remains a subject of considerable debate, one approach is to examine the genomic organization at these active sites that are correlated with epigenetic marks of centromere function.


RESULTS
we have developed an approach to characterize both satellite and non-satellite centromeric sequences that are missing from current assemblies in complex genomes, using the dog genome as an example. combining this genomic reference with an epigenetic dataset corresponding to sequences associated with the histone h <dig> variant centromere protein a , we identify active satellite sequence domains that appear to be both functionally and spatially distinct within the overall definition of satellite families.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings establish a genomic and epigenetic foundation for exploring the functional role of centromeric sequences in the previously sequenced dog genome and provide a model for similar studies within the context of less-characterized genomes.
