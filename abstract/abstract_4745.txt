BACKGROUND
box-a1r-based repetitive extragenic palindromic-pcr  is one of the most used techniques in biogeography studies of microbial isolates. however the traditional separation of box-pcr patterns by agarose gel electrophoresis suffers many limitations. the aim of this research was to set up a fluorescent box-pcr  assay in which separation of pcr products is automated in a capillary electrophoresis system. f-box-pcr was compared with the traditional box-pcr using bacterial strains with different g+c content . resolution, discriminatory power and reproducibility were evaluated by assaying different electrophoretic runs, pcr reactions and independent dna extractions. box-pcr and f-box-pcr were compared for the analysis of  <dig> strains of modestobacter multiseptatus isolated from three different microsites in an altered carbonatic wall from cagliari, italy, and  <dig> strains of streptococcus thermophilus isolated from  <dig> samples of the hand-made, yogurt-like product matsoni, collected in different locations in georgia.


RESULTS
fluorophore 6-fam proved more informative than hex and box-pcr both in agarose gel electrophoresis  and in capillary electrophoresis . 6-fam- and hex-based f-box-pcr respectively detected up to  <dig>  and  <dig>  times more fragments than box-pcr. replicate separations of f-box-pcr showed an accuracy of the size calling of ±  <dig>  bp until  <dig> bp, constantly decreasing to ±  <dig> bp at  <dig> bp. cluster analysis of f-box-pcr profiles grouped m. multiseptatus strains according to the microsite of isolation and s. thermophilus strains according to the geographical origin of matsoni, but resulted intermixed when a box-pcr dataset was used.


CONCLUSIONS
f-box-pcr represents an improved method for addressing bacterial biogeography studies both in term of sensitivity, reproducibility and data analysis.
