BACKGROUND
increased adipose thermogenesis is being considered as a strategy aimed at preventing or reversing obesity. thus, regulation of the uncoupling protein  <dig>  gene in human adipocytes is of significant interest. retinoic acid , the carboxylic acid form of vitamin a, displays agonist activity toward several nuclear hormone receptors, including ra receptors  and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ . moreover, ra is a potent positive regulator of ucp <dig> expression in mouse adipocytes.


RESULTS
the effects of all-trans ra  on ucp <dig> gene expression in models of mouse and human adipocyte differentiation were investigated. atra induced ucp <dig> expression in all mouse white and brown adipocytes, but inhibited or had no effect on ucp <dig> expression in human adipocyte cell lines and primary human white adipocytes. experiments with various rar agonists and a rar antagonist in mouse cells demonstrated that the stimulatory effect of atra on ucp <dig> gene expression was indeed mediated by rars. consistently, a pparδ agonist was without effect. moreover, the atra-mediated induction of ucp <dig> expression in mouse adipocytes was independent of pparγ coactivator-1α.


CONCLUSIONS
ucp <dig> expression is differently affected by atra in mouse and human adipocytes. atra induces ucp <dig> expression in mouse adipocytes through activation of rars, whereas expression of ucp <dig> in human adipocytes is not increased by exposure to atra.
