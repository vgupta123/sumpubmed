BACKGROUND
mitogen activated protein kinase  cascade is an important signaling cascade that operates in stress signal transduction in plants. the biologically active monoterpenoid indole alkaloids  produced in catharanthus roseus are known to be induced under several abiotic stress conditions such as wounding, uv-b etc. however involvement of any signaling component in the accumulation of mias remains poorly investigated so far. here we report isolation of a novel abiotic stress inducible catharanthus roseus mapk, crmpk <dig> that may have role in accumulation of mias in response to abiotic stress.


RESULTS
crmpk <dig> expressed in bacterial system is an active kinase as it showed auto-phosphorylation and phosphorylation of myelin basic protein. crmpk <dig> though localized in cytoplasm, moves to nucleus upon wounding. wounding, uv treatment and meja application on c. roseus leaves resulted in the transcript accumulation of crmpk <dig> as well as activation of mapk in c. roseus leaves. immuno-precipitation followed by immunoblot analysis revealed that wounding, uv treatment and methyl jasmonate  activate crmpk <dig>  transient over-expression of crmpk <dig> in c. roseus leaf tissue showed enhanced expression of key mia biosynthesis pathway genes and also accumulation of specific mias.


CONCLUSIONS
results from our study suggest a possible involvement of crmpk <dig> in abiotic stress signal transduction towards regulation of transcripts of key mia biosynthetic pathway genes, regulators and accumulation of major mias.
