BACKGROUND
elevation of soluble major histocompatibility complex class i chain-related gene a  products in serum has been linked to tissue/organ transplantation, autoimmune diseases and some malignant disorders. cells infected by microbiological pathogens may release smica, whereas less is known whether and to what extent serum smica levels may change in infectious diseases.

methods
the present study determined serum smica levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  in a southern china population, including patients  suffering from several types of malignant and infectious diseases and healthy controls .


RESULTS
relative to controls, serum smica elevation was significant in patients of hepatic cancer, and was approaching statistical significance in patients with lung, gastric and nasopharyngeal cancers. smica elevation was also associated with some bacterial , viral  and the microspironema pallidum infections.


CONCLUSIONS
serum smica levels may be informative for the diagnosis of some malignant and infectious diseases. the results also indicate that microbiological infections should be considered as a potential confounding clinical condition causing serum smica elevation while using this test to evaluate the status of other disorders, such as cancers, host-graft response and autoimmune diseases.
