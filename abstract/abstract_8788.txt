BACKGROUND
ppp1r <dig> is a protein phosphatase  <dig> glycogen-targeting subunit  abundant in skeletal muscle with an undefined metabolic control role. here ppp1r <dig> effects on myotube glycogen metabolism, particle size and subcellular distribution are examined and compared with ppp1r3c/ptg and ppp1r3a/gm.


RESULTS
ppp1r <dig> overexpression activates glycogen synthase , reduces its phosphorylation at ser-641/ <dig> and increases the extracted and cytochemically-stained glycogen content, less than ptg but more than gm. ppp1r <dig> does not change glycogen phosphorylase activity. all tested pp1-gts-cells have more glycogen particles than controls as found by electron microscopy of myotube sections. glycogen particle size is distributed for all cell-types in a continuous range, but ppp1r <dig> forms smaller particles  than ptg  and gm  or those in control cells . both ppp1r6- and gm-derived glycogen particles are in cytosol associated with cellular structures; ptg-derived glycogen is found in membrane- and organelle-devoid cytosolic glycogen-rich areas; and glycogen particles are dispersed in the cytosol in control cells. a tagged ppp1r <dig> protein at the c-terminus with egfp shows a diffuse cytosol pattern in glucose-replete and -depleted cells and a punctuate pattern surrounding the nucleus in glucose-depleted cells, which colocates with rfp tagged with the golgi targeting domain of Î²- <dig> -galactosyltransferase, according to a computational prediction for ppp1r <dig> golgi location.


CONCLUSIONS
ppp1r <dig> exerts a powerful glycogenic effect in cultured muscle cells, more than gm and less than ptg. ppp1r <dig> protein translocates from a golgi to cytosolic location in response to glucose. the molecular size and subcellular location of myotube glycogen particles is determined by the ppp1r <dig>  ptg and gm scaffolding.
