BACKGROUND
high molecular weight glutenin subunits  have been proved to be mostly correlated with the processing quality of common wheat . but wheat cultivars have limited number of high quality hmw-gs. however, novel hmw-gs were found to be present in many wheat asymmetric somatic hybrid introgression lines of common wheat/agropyron elongatum.


RESULTS
to exploit how these new subunits were generated, we isolated hmw-gs genes from two sib hybrid lines  and compared them with those from their parents. the result shows that two genes of hybrid  are directly introgressed from the donor parent agropyron elongatum; one hybrid gene  comes from point mutation of a parental wheat gene ; two other hybrid genes  are likely resulting from unequal crossover or slippage of a parental wheat gene ; and the sixth novel hybrid gene  may come from recombination between two parental genes.


CONCLUSIONS
therefore, we demonstrate that novel hmw-gs genes can be rapidly created through asymmetric somatic hybridization in a manner similar with the evolution mechanism of these genes supposed before. we also described gene shuffling as a new mechanism of novel hmw-gs gene formation in hybrids. the results suggest that asymmetric somatic hybridization is an important approach for widening hmw-gs genebank of wheat quality improvement.
