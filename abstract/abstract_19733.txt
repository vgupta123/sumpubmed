BACKGROUND
in the bone marrow, hematopietic and mesenchymal stem cells form a unique niche in which the oxygen tension is low. hypoxia may have a role in maintaining stem cell fate, self renewal and multipotency. however, whereas most studies addressed the effect of transient in vitro exposure of msc to hypoxia, permanent culture under hypoxia should reflect the better physiological conditions.


RESULTS
morphologic studies, differentiation and transcriptional profiling experiments were performed on msc cultured in normoxia  versus hypoxia  for up to passage  <dig>  cells at passage  <dig> and at passage  <dig> were compared, and those at passage  <dig> in hypoxia generated fewer and smaller colonies than in normoxia. in parallel, msc displayed  inhibition of genes involved in dna metabolism, cell cycle progression and chromosome cohesion whereas transcripts involved in adhesion and metabolism  were stimulated. compared to normoxic cells, hypoxic cells were morphologically undifferentiated and contained less mitochondrias. after this lag phase, cells at passage  <dig> in hypoxia outgrew the cells cultured in normoxia and displayed an enhanced expression of genes  involved in extracellular matrix assembly , neural and muscle development  and epithelial development . this group described herein for the first time was assigned by the gene ontology program to "plasticity".


CONCLUSIONS
the duration of hypoxemia is a critical parameter in the differentiation capacity of msc. even in growth promoting conditions, hypoxia enhanced a genetic program that maintained the cells undifferentiated and multipotent. this condition may better reflect the in vivo gene signature of msc, with potential implications in regenerative medicine.
