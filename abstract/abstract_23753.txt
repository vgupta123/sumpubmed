BACKGROUND
the anti-inflammatory effects of proanthocyanidins , isolated from blackcurrant  leaves, were analysed using carrageenin-induced paw oedema and carrageenin-induced pleurisy in rats.


RESULTS
pretreatment of the animals with pacs  reduced paw oedema induced by carrageenin in a dose and time-dependent manner. pacs also inhibited dose-dependently carrageenin-induced pleurisy in rats. they reduced  lung injury,  pleural exudate formation,  polymorphonuclear cell infiltration,  pleural exudate levels of tnf-α, il-1β and cinc- <dig> but did not affect il- <dig> and il- <dig> levels. they reduced  pleural exudate levels of nitrite/nitrate . in indomethacin treated rats, the volume of pleural exudate was low, its content in leukocytes and its contents in tnf-α, il-1β, il- <dig> and il- <dig> but not in nox were reduced. these data suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of pacs are achieved through a different pattern from those of indomethacin.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that the main mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of pacs mainly lies in an interference with the migration of the leukocytes. moreover, pacs inhibited in vivo nitric oxide release.
