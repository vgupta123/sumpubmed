BACKGROUND
the gtfb enzyme of the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus reuteri  <dig> is a  <dig> -α-glucanotransferase of glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> . contrary to the glucansucrases in gh <dig>  gtfb is unable to use sucrose as substrate, but instead converts malto-oligosaccharides and starch into isomalto-/malto- polymers that may find application as prebiotics and dietary fibers. the gtfb enzyme expresses well in escherichia coli bl <dig> star , but mostly accumulates in inclusion bodies  which generally contain wrongly folded protein and inactive enzyme.

methods
denaturation followed by refolding, as well as ncib preparation were used for isolation of active gtfb protein from inclusion bodies. soluble, refolded and ncib gtfb were compared using activity assays, secondary structure analysis by ft-ir, and product analyses by nmr, hpaec and sec.


RESULTS
expression of gtfb in e. coli yielded >  <dig> mg/l relatively pure and active but mostly insoluble gtfb protein in ibs, regardless of the expression conditions used. following denaturing, refolding of gtfb protein was most efficient in double distilled h2o. also, gtfb ncibs were active, with approx.  <dig> % of hydrolysis activity compared to the soluble protein. when expressed as units of activity obtained per liter e. coli culture, the total amount of ncib gtfb expressed possessed around  <dig> % hydrolysis activity and  <dig> % transferase activity compared to the amount of soluble gtfb enzyme obtained from one liter culture. the product profiles obtained for the three gtfb enzyme preparations were similar when analyzed by hpaec and nmr. sec investigation also showed that these  <dig> enzyme preparations yielded products with similar size distributions. ft-ir analysis revealed extended β-sheet formation in ncib gtfb providing an explanation at the molecular level for reduced gtfb activity in ncibs. the thermostability of ncib gtfb was relatively high compared to the soluble and refolded gtfb.


CONCLUSIONS
in view of their relatively high yield, activity and high thermostability, both refolded and ncib gtfb derived from ibs in e. coli may find industrial application in the synthesis of modified starches.
