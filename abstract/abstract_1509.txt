BACKGROUND
genome-wide association studies  using single nucleotide polymorphism  markers generate large quantities of tests results. global and local graphical viewing of the test results is an effective approach to digest and interpret gwas results.


RESULTS
snpevg is a set of graphical tools for instant global and local viewing and graphing of gwas results for all chromosomes and for each trait. the current version includes three programs, snpevg <dig>  snpevg <dig> and snpevg <dig>  snpevg <dig> is a graphical tool for snp effect viewing of p-values allowing multiple traits. the total number of graphs that can be generated by one ‘run’ is n, where n is number of ‘traits’ with  <dig> < n ≤  <dig>  and c is the number of chromosomes. snp effect viewing and graphing is accomplished through a user friendly graphical user interface  that provides a wide-range of options for the user to choose. the gui can produce the manhattan plot, the q-q plot of all snp effects, and graphs for snp effects by chromosome by clicking one command. any or all the graphs can be saved with publication quality by clicking one command. snpevg <dig> is for the viewing and graphing of multiple traits on the same graph with options to graph any or all of the traits, customizable colors and user specified y <dig> or y <dig> axis for each traits. the snpevg <dig> program uses the output file of single-locus test results from the episnp computer package as the input file. each chromosome figure can display three genetic effects , and the number of observations.


CONCLUSIONS
the snpevg package is a versatile, flexible and efficient graphical tool for rapid digestion of large quantities of gwas results with mouse clicks.
