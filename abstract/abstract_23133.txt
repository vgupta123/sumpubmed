BACKGROUND
it is becoming apparent that perhaps as much as half of the genome of the human blood fluke schistosoma mansoni is constituted of mobile genetic element-related sequences. non-long terminal repeat  retrotransposons, related to the line elements of mammals, comprise much of this repetitive component of the schistosome genome. of more than  <dig> recognized clades of non-ltr retrotransposons, only members of the cr <dig>  rte, and r <dig> clades have been reported from the schistosome genome.


RESULTS
inspection of the nucleotide sequence of bacterial artificial chromosome number 49_j_ <dig> from chromosome  <dig> of the genome of schistosoma mansoni  revealed the likely presence of several rte-like retrotransposons. among these, a new non-ltr retrotransposon designated sr <dig> was identified and is characterized here. analysis of gene structure and phylogenetic analysis of both the reverse transcriptase and endonuclease domains of the mobile element indicated that sr <dig> represented a new family of rte-like non-ltr retrotransposons. remarkably, two full-length copies of sr3-like elements were present in bac 49-j- <dig>  and one of  <dig>  bp in length appeared to be intact, indicating sr <dig> to be an active non-ltr retrotransposon. both were flanked by target site duplications of 10â€“ <dig> bp. southern hybridization and bioinformatics analyses indicated the presence of numerous copies  of sr <dig> interspersed throughout the genome of s. mansoni. bioinformatics analyses also revealed sr <dig> to be transcribed in both larval and adult developmental stages of s. mansoni and to be also present in the genomes of the other major schistosome parasites of humans, schistosoma haematobium and s. japonicum.


CONCLUSIONS
numerous copies of sr <dig>  a novel non-ltr retrotransposon of the rte clade are present in the genome of s. mansoni. non-ltr retrotransposons of the rte clade including sr <dig> appear to have been remarkably successful in colonizing, and proliferation within the schistosome genome.
