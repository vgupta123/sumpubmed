BACKGROUND
structural comparison between bacterial cueo and fungal laccases has suggested that a charged residue glu  in cueo replaces the corresponding residue phe in fungal laccases at the gate of the tunnel connecting type ii copper to the protein surface and an extra α-helix  near the type i copper site covers the substrate binding pocket and might compromise the electron transfer from substrate to type i copper. to test this hypothesis, several mutants were made in klebsiella sp.  <dig> multicopper oxidase, which is highly homologous to e. coli cueo with a similarity of 90% and an identity of 78%.


RESULTS
the e106f mutant gave smaller km  and kcat  values for all three substrates dmp, abts and sgz as compared with those for the wild-type enzyme. its slightly larger kcat/km values for three substrates mainly come from the decreased km. deleting α-helix  resulted in the formation of inactive inclusion body when the mutant Δα351- <dig> was expressed in e. coli. another mutant α351-380m was then made via substitution of seven amino acid residues in the α-helix  region. the α351-380m mutant was active, and displayed a far-uv cd spectrum markedly different from that for wild-type enzyme. kinetic studies showed the α351-380m mutant gave very low km values for dmp, abts and sgz,  <dig> -,  <dig> - and 7-fold less than those for the wild type. in addition, kcat/km values were increased,  <dig> -fold for dmp, similar for abts and 3-fold for sgz.


CONCLUSIONS
the glu residue at position  <dig> appears not to be the only factor affecting the copper binding, and it may also play a role in maintaining enzyme conformation. the α-helix  may not only block access to the type i copper site but also play a role in substrate specificities of bacterial mcos. the α351-380m mutant catalyzing oxidation of the phenolic substrate dmp effectively would be very useful in green chemistry.
