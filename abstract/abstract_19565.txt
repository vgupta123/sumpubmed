BACKGROUND
we have analyzed the complete mitochondrial genomes of  <dig> pan paniscus  individuals to assess the detailed mitochondrial dna  phylogeny of this close relative of homo sapiens.


RESULTS
we identified three major clades among bonobos that separated approximately  <dig>  years ago, as suggested by bayesian analysis. incidentally, we discovered that the current reference sequence for bonobo likely is a hybrid of the mitochondrial genomes of two distant individuals. when comparing spectra of polymorphic mtdna sites in bonobos and humans, we observed two major differences:  of all  <dig> bonobo mtdna homoplasies, i.e. nucleotide changes that occurred independently on separate branches of the phylogenetic tree,  <dig> were not homoplasic in humans. this indicates that at least a part of the unstable sites of the mitochondrial genome is species-specific and difficult to be explained on the basis of a mutational hotspot concept.  a comparison of the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous changes  among polymorphic positions in bonobos and in  <dig> homo sapiens mitochondrial genomes revealed a remarkable difference in the strength of purifying selection in the mitochondrial genes of the f0f1-atpase complex. while in bonobos this complex showed a similar low value as complexes i and iv, human haplogroups displayed  <dig>  to  <dig>  times increased dn/ds ratios when compared to bonobos.


CONCLUSIONS
some variants of mitochondrially encoded subunits of the atpase complex in humans very likely decrease the efficiency of energy conversion leading to production of extra heat. thus, we hypothesize that the species-specific release of evolutionary constraints for the mitochondrial genes of the proton-translocating atpase is a consequence of altered heat homeostasis in modern humans.
