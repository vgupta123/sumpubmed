BACKGROUND
transmission electron tomography is an increasingly common three-dimensional electron microscopy approach that can provide new insights into the structure of subcellular components. transmission electron tomography fills the gap between high resolution structural methods  and optical microscopy. we developed new software for transmission electron tomography, tomoj. tomoj is a plug-in for the now standard image analysis and processing software for optical microscopy, imagej.


RESULTS
tomoj provides a user-friendly interface for alignment, reconstruction, and combination of multiple tomographic volumes and includes the most recent algorithms for volume reconstructions used in three-dimensional electron microscopy  as well as the commonly used approach of weighted back-projection.


CONCLUSIONS
the software presented in this work is specifically designed for electron tomography. it has been written in java as a plug-in for imagej and is distributed as freeware.
