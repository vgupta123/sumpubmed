BACKGROUND
receptor activity modifying protein- <dig>  is a single transmembrane-domain protein required for the functional expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide  receptors. to date, little is known about the molecular mechanism that activate/inhibit ramp- <dig> gene expression. such mechanism are likely to play a major role in modulating the responsiveness of tissues to cgrp.


RESULTS
to initiate studies on the transcriptional regulation of the mouse ramp- <dig> gene, ramp- <dig> transcriptional initiation sites were mapped in a variety of tissues. analysis of ramp- <dig> expression in c2c <dig> myoblasts demonstrated that ramp- <dig> mrna is expressed at greatest levels in confluent myoblasts verses non-confluent and fused myoblasts. transfection of confluent c2c <dig> myoblasts and nih 3t <dig> cells with ramp- <dig> promoter/luciferase deletion constructs revealed that  <dig>  kb of ramp- <dig> 5' flanking region demonstrated optimal promoter activity while  <dig> bp of 5' flanking region was defined as a minimal ramp- <dig> promoter. in non-ramp- <dig> expressing hek <dig> cells, constructs containing  <dig>  kb to  <dig> bp of ramp- <dig> 5' flanking region were transcriptionally inactive. however, deletion of sequences - <dig> to - <dig> activated ramp- <dig> promoter activity.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that tissue specificity of ramp- <dig> gene expression is mediated by a negative acting transcription factor that represses ramp- <dig> gene expression in non-ramp- <dig> expressing tissues. this transcription factor is therefore likely to play an important role in modulating the responsiveness of tissues to cgrp.
