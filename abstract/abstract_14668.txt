BACKGROUND
the moss physcomitrella patens is an emerging model in comparative plant science. at present, the physcomitrella genome is sequenced at the joint genome institute . in this study we present our results on the development of expressed sequence tag-derived microsatellite markers for physcomitrella patens, their classification and applicability as genetic markers on the intra- as well as on the interspecies level. we experienced severe restrictions to compare our results on physcomitrella with earlier studies for other plant species due to varying microsatellite search criteria and a limited selection of analysed species. as a consequence, we performed a side by side analysis of expressed sequence tag-derived microsatellites among  <dig> plant species covering a broad phylogenetic range and present our results on the observed frequencies.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig>  microsatellites using the software misa in a non-redundant physcomitrella expressed sequence tag database comprising more than  <dig> megabases of nucleotide information. for  <dig>  microsatellites appendant primer sequences have been derived. pcr of  <dig> microsatellites yielded  <dig> % successful amplicons and over  <dig> % polymorphisms between two physcomitrella accessions. the polymorphism information content of  <dig> microsatellites based on  <dig> different physcomitrella accessions was comparably high with a mean of  <dig>  +/-  <dig> . of the  <dig> physcomitrella microsatellite markers,  <dig> % respectively  <dig>  % revealed cross-species applicability in two closely related moss species.

in our survey of two green algae, two mosses, a fern, a fern palm, the ginkgo tree, two conifers, ten dicots and five monocots we detected an up to sevenfold variation in the overall frequency with a minimum of  <dig> up to maximal  <dig> microsatellites per megabase and a high variability among the different microsatellite class and motif frequencies. numerous species-specific microsatellite frequencies became evident and several deviations to earlier reports were ascertained.


CONCLUSIONS
with the physcomitrella microsatellite marker set a valuable tool has been made available for further genetic and genomic applications on the intra- as well as on the interspecies level. the comparative survey of expressed sequence tag-derived microsatellites among the plant kingdom is well suited for a classification of future studies on plant microsatellites.
