BACKGROUND
rapid and accurate retrieval of whole genome sequences of human pathogens from disease vectors or animal reservoirs will enable fine-resolution studies of pathogen epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics. however, next generation sequencing technologies have not yet been fully harnessed for the study of vector-borne and zoonotic pathogens, due to the difficulty of obtaining high-quality pathogen sequence data directly from field specimens with a high ratio of host to pathogen dna.


RESULTS
we addressed this challenge by using custom probes for multiplexed hybrid capture to enrich for and sequence  <dig> borrelia burgdorferi genomes from field samples of its arthropod vector. hybrid capture enabled sequencing of nearly the complete genome  of the borrelia burgdorferi pathogen with 132-fold coverage, and identification of up to  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms per genome.


CONCLUSIONS
the proprosed culture-independent method enables efficient whole genome capture and sequencing of pathogens directly from arthropod vectors, thus making population genomic study of vector-borne and zoonotic infectious diseases economically feasible and scalable. furthermore, given the similarities of invertebrate field specimens to other mixed dna templates characterized by a high ratio of host to pathogen dna, we discuss the potential applicabilty of hybrid capture for genomic study across diverse study systems.
