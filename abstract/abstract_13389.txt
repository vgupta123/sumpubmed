BACKGROUND

panicum hallii vasey  is a compact, perennial c <dig> grass in the family poaceae, which has potential to enable bioenergy research for switchgrass . unlike p. hallii, switchgrass has a large genome, allopolyploidy, self-incompatibility, a long life cycle, and large stature—all suboptimal traits for rapid genetics research. herein we improved tissue culture methodologies for two inbred p. hallii populations: fil <dig> and hal <dig>  to enable further development of p. hallii as a model c <dig> plant.


RESULTS
the optimal seed-derived callus induction medium was determined to be murashige and skoog  medium supplemented with 40 mg l− <dig> l-cysteine, 300 mg l− <dig> l-proline, 3% sucrose, 1 g l− <dig> casein hydrolysate, 3 mg l− <dig>  <dig> -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid , and 45 μg l− <dig> 6-benzylaminopurine , which resulted in callus induction of 51 ± 29% for fil <dig> and 81 ± 19% for hal <dig>  the optimal inflorescence-derived callus induction was observed on mp medium , resulting in callus induction of 100 ±  <dig> % for fil <dig> and 84 ±  <dig> % for hal <dig>  shoot regeneration rates of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  shoots/gram for fil <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  shoots/gram for hal <dig> were achieved using seed-induced callus, whereas shoot regeneration rates of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  shoots/gram for fil <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  shoots/gram for hal <dig> were achieved from inflorescence-induced callus. further, cell suspension cultures of p. hallii were established from seed-derived callus, providing faster generation of callus tissue compared with culture using solidified media .


CONCLUSIONS
aside from abbreviated tissue culture times from callus induction to plant regeneration for hal <dig>  we noted no apparent differences between fil <dig> and hal <dig> populations in tissue culture performance. for both populations, the cell suspension cultures outperformed tissue cultures on solidified media. using the methods developed in this work, p. hallii callus was induced from seeds immediately after harvest in a shorter time and with higher frequencies than switchgrass. for clonal propagation, p. hallii callus was established from r <dig> inflorescences, similar to switchgrass, which further strengthens the potential of this plant as a c <dig> model for genetic studies. the rapid cycling  and ease of culture, further demonstrate the potential utility of p. hallii as a c <dig> model plant.
