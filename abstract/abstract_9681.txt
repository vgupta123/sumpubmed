BACKGROUND
identification of essential proteins is always a challenging task since it requires experimental approaches that are time-consuming and laborious. with the advances in high throughput technologies, a large number of protein-protein interactions are available, which have produced unprecedented opportunities for detecting proteins' essentialities from the network level. there have been a series of computational approaches proposed for predicting essential proteins based on network topologies. however, the network topology-based centrality measures are very sensitive to the robustness of network. therefore, a new robust essential protein discovery method would be of great value.


RESULTS
in this paper, we propose a new centrality measure, named pec, based on the integration of protein-protein interaction and gene expression data. the performance of pec is validated based on the protein-protein interaction network of saccharomyces cerevisiae. the experimental results show that the predicted precision of pec clearly exceeds that of the other fifteen previously proposed centrality measures: degree centrality , betweenness centrality , closeness centrality , subgraph centrality , eigenvector centrality , information centrality , bottle neck , density of maximum neighborhood component , local average connectivity-based method , sum of ecc , range-limited centrality , l-index , leader rank , normalized Î±-centrality , and moduland-centrality . especially, the improvement of pec over the classic centrality measures  is more than 50% when predicting no more than  <dig> proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that the integration of protein-protein interaction network and gene expression data can help improve the precision of predicting essential proteins. the new centrality measure, pec, is an effective essential protein discovery method.
