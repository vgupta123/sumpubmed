BACKGROUND
immunomagnetic nanobead  labeled with specific antibody, has been demonstrated to be useful for the capturing and detection of viruses.


RESULTS
in this study, we developed an imunomagnetic bead based on carboxyl-magnetic beads  labeled with a single-domain antibody  for capturing foot-and-mouth disease  asia  <dig> virus. after magnetic separation, complexes of mnb-sdab-virus were detected with either a sandwich elisa or qds-c <dig> probe under a fluorescence microscope, and the complexes were used as templates for extraction of total rna for amplification of the vp <dig> or 3d gene fragments using rt-pcr and real-time rt-pcr. the asia  <dig> vlps were efficiently captured through imnb with a high binding rate of  <dig>  μg of antigen/μl of bead suspension. moreover, this method has been successfully used to capture asia  <dig> antigen in synthetic samples.


CONCLUSIONS
ultimately, a specific and highly sensitive capture fmdv asia  <dig> tool has been established that has the potential to enhance the sensitivity and reliability when diagnosing fmdv asia  <dig>
