BACKGROUND
abc proteins constitute one of the largest families of transporters found in all living organisms. in arabidopsis thaliana,  <dig> genes encoding abc transporters have been identified. here, the characterization of one member of the mrp subclass, atmrp <dig>  is described.


RESULTS
this gene, located on chromosome  <dig>  is bordered by atmrp <dig> and atmrp <dig>  using real-time quantitative pcr  and the gus reporter gene, we found that this gene is essentially expressed during early seedling development, in the apical meristem and at initiation point of secondary roots, especially in xylem-opposite pericycle cells where lateral roots initiate. the level of expression of atmrp <dig> in response to various stresses was explored and a significant up-regulation after cadmium  treatment was detected. among the three t-dna insertion lines available from the salk institute library, two knock-out mutants, atmrp <dig>  and atmrp <dig>  were invalidated for the atmrp <dig> gene. in the presence of cd, development of leaves was more affected in the mutants than wild-type plants, whereas root elongation and ramification was comparable.


CONCLUSIONS
the position of atmrp <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  flanked by two other mrp genes,  suggests that atmrp <dig> is part of a cluster involved in metal tolerance, although additional functions in planta cannot be discarded.
