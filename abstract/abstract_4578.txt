BACKGROUND
indian cattle  and riverine buffalo  give a poor yield of milk but it has a high fat and protein percentage compared to taurine cattle. the identification of qtls  on bta <dig> and bta <dig> and its subsequent fine mapping has led to identification of two non conservative mutations affecting milk production and composition. our objective was to estimate the frequency of k232a  and y581s  polymorphisms in diverse cattle and buffalo breeds of india having large variation in terms of milk production.


RESULTS
we screened the reported missense mutations in six cattle and five buffalo breeds. the dgat1k and abcg2y alleles were found to be fixed in indian cattle and buffalo breeds studied.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides an indirect evidence that all the indian cattle and buffalo breeds have fixed alleles with respect to dgat <dig> and abcg <dig> genes reported to be responsible for higher milk fat yield, higher fat and protein percent.
