BACKGROUND
nitrogen , a critical macronutrient for plant growth and development, is a major limiting factor in most agricultural systems. microarray analyses have been conducted to investigate genome-wide gene expression in response to changes in n concentrations. although rna-seq analysis can provide a more precise determination of transcript levels, it has not previously been employed to investigate the expression of n-starvation-induced genes.


RESULTS
we constructed cdna libraries from leaf sheaths and roots of rice plants grown under n-deficient or -sufficient conditions for 12 h. sequencing the libraries resulted in identification of  <dig>  annotated genes. a comparison of abundances revealed  <dig>  transcripts that were differentially expressed  due to an n-deficiency. among them,  <dig>  were differentially expressed in the leaf sheaths  and  <dig> in the roots . among the  <dig> deficiency-induced genes first identified via rna-seq analyses,  <dig> were subsequently confirmed by qrt-pcr. our rna-seq data identified  <dig>  multi-exonic genes with  <dig>  alternative splicing events. however, we saw no significant difference in alternative splicing between n-sufficient and -deficient conditions. we found  <dig>  novel transcripts, of which  <dig> were regulated under the n-deficiency.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig>  genes that were differentially expressed after 12 h of n-starvation. responses by those genes to a limited supply of n were confirmed by rt-pcr and gus assays. our results provide valuable information about n-starvation-responsive genes and will be useful when investigating the signal transduction pathway of n-utilization.
