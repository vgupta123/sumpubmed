BACKGROUND
regulatory proteins  such as transcription factors  and two-component system  proteins control how prokaryotic cells respond to changes in their external and/or internal state. identification and annotation of tfs and tcss is non-trivial, and between-genome comparisons are often confounded by different standards in annotation. there is a need for user-friendly, fast and convenient tools to allow researchers to overcome the inherent variability in annotation between genome sequences.


RESULTS
we have developed the web-server p2rp , which enables users to identify and annotate tfs and tcs proteins within their sequences of interest. users can input amino acid or genomic dna sequences, and predicted proteins therein are scanned for the possession of dna-binding domains and/or tcs domains. rps identified in this manner are categorised into families, unambiguously annotated, and a detailed description of their features generated, using an integrated software pipeline. p2rp results can then be outputted in user-specified formats.


CONCLUSIONS
biologists have an increasing need for fast and intuitively usable tools, which is why p2rp has been developed as an interactive system. as well as assisting experimental biologists to interrogate novel sequence data, it is hoped that p2rp will be built into genome annotation pipelines and re-annotation processes, to increase the consistency of rp annotation in public genomic sequences. p2rp is the first publicly available tool for predicting and analysing rp proteins in usersâ€™ sequences. the server is freely available and can be accessed along with documentation at http://www.p2rp.org.
