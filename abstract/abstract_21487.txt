BACKGROUND
recently, rna sequencing  has rapidly emerged as a major transcriptome profiling system. elucidation of the bovine mammary gland transcriptome by rna-seq is essential for identifying candidate genes that contribute to milk composition traits in dairy cattle.


RESULTS
we used massive, parallel, high-throughput, rna-seq to generate the bovine transcriptome from the mammary glands of four lactating holstein cows with extremely high and low phenotypic values of milk protein and fat percentage. in total, we obtained  <dig> ,376â€“ <dig> , <dig> uniquely mapped reads that covered  <dig> % of the current annotated transcripts, which represented  <dig> mrna transcripts, across all the four mammary gland samples. among them,  <dig> differentially expressed genes  between the high and low groups of cows were revealed. gene ontology and pathway analysis demonstrated that the  <dig> differently expressed genes were enriched in specific biological processes with regard to protein metabolism, fat metabolism, and mammary gland development . integrated analysis of differential gene expression, previously reported quantitative trait loci, and genome-wide association studies indicated that trib <dig>  saa , vegfa, pthlh, and rpl23a were the most promising candidate genes affecting milk protein and fat percentage.


CONCLUSIONS
this study investigated the complexity of the mammary gland transcriptome in dairy cattle using rna-seq. integrated analysis of differential gene expression and the reported quantitative trait loci and genome-wide association study data permitted the identification of candidate key genes for milk composition traits.
