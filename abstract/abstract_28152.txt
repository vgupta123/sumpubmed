BACKGROUND
identification of dna-binding proteins is one of the major challenges in the field of genome annotation, as these proteins play a crucial role in gene-regulation. in this paper, we developed various svm modules for predicting dna-binding domains and proteins. all models were trained and tested on multiple datasets of non-redundant proteins.


RESULTS
svm models have been developed on dnaaset, which consists of  <dig> dna-binding and equal number of non dna-binding proteins, and achieved the maximum accuracy of  <dig> % and  <dig> % using amino acid and dipeptide compositions, respectively. the performance of svm model improved from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, when evolutionary information in form of pssm profiles was used as input instead of amino acid composition. in addition, svm models have been developed on dnaset, which consists of  <dig> dna-binding and  <dig> non-binding chains/domains, and achieved the maximum accuracy of  <dig> % and  <dig> % using amino acid composition and pssm profiles. the svm models developed in this study perform better than existing methods on a blind dataset.


CONCLUSIONS
a highly accurate method has been developed for predicting dna-binding proteins using svm and pssm profiles. this is the first study in which evolutionary information in form of pssm profiles has been used successfully for predicting dna-binding proteins. a web-server dnabinder has been developed for identifying dna-binding proteins and domains from query amino acid sequences .
