BACKGROUND
stoned olive pomace , which represents approximately 50% of the conversion process of olives to olive oil, is largely not utilised and creates costs for its disposal and has negative environmental impacts. in vitro trial experiments were employed to study the effect of feeds integrated with this bio-waste, which is rich in polyphenols, on rumen biohydrogenation, using sheep rumen liquor as inoculum.


RESULTS
fatty acid  analysis and a polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis  approach aimed at characterising the microbial community indicated that including sop in feeds at the level of 50 g/kg and 90 g/kg induced changes in the fa profile and microbial populations. the simultaneous decrease of butyrivibrio proteoclasticus and accumulation of vaccenic acid was observed. a depression in the populations of neisseria weaveri, ruminobacter amylophilus and other unclassified bacteria related to members of the lachnospiraceae and pasteurellaceae families was detected, suggesting that these microbial groups may be involved in rumen biohydrogenation.


CONCLUSIONS
supplementation of feeds with sop alters the rumen bacterial community, including bacteria responsible for the hydrogenation of vaccenic acid to stearic acid, thereby modifying the fa profile of the rumen liquor. hence, a use of sop aimed to produce meat or dairy products enriched in functional lipids can be hypothesised.
