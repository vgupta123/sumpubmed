BACKGROUND
pinnipeds, including many endangered and declining species, are inaccessible and difficult to monitor for extended periods using externally attached telemetry devices that are shed during the annual molt. archival satellite transmitters were implanted intraperitoneally into four rehabilitated california sea lions  and  <dig> wild juvenile steller sea lions  to determine the viability of this surgical technique for the deployment of long-term telemetry devices in otariids. the life history transmitters record information throughout the life of the host and transmit data to orbiting satellites after extrusion following death of the host.


RESULTS
surgeries were performed under isoflurane anesthesia and single  or dual  transmitters were inserted into the ventrocaudal abdominal cavity via an  <dig>  to  <dig> cm incision along the ventral midline between the umbilicus and pubic symphysis or preputial opening. surgeries lasted  <dig> minutes  for the  <dig> sea lions. all animals recovered well and were released into the wild after extended monitoring periods from  <dig> to  <dig> days at two captive animal facilities. minimum post-implant survival was determined via post-release tracking using externally attached satellite transmitters or via opportunistic re-sighting for mean durations of  <dig>  days  and  <dig>  days .


CONCLUSIONS
the low morbidity and zero mortality encountered during captive observation and post-release tracking periods confirm the viability of this surgical technique for the implantation of long-term telemetry devices in otariids.
