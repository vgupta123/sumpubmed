BACKGROUND
two-photon dual-color imaging of tissues and cells labeled with fluorescent proteins  is challenging because most two-photon microscopes only provide one laser excitation wavelength at a time. at present, methods for two-photon dual-color imaging are limited due to the requirement of large differences in stokes shifts between the fps used and their low two-photon absorption  efficiency.


RESULTS
here we present a new method of dual-color two-photon microscopy that uses the simultaneous excitation of the lowest-energy electronic transition of a blue fluorescent protein and a higher-energy electronic transition of a red fluorescent protein.


CONCLUSIONS
our method does not require large differences in stokes shifts and can be extended to a variety of fp pairs with larger 2pa efficiency and more optimal imaging properties.
