BACKGROUND
this study was conducted to evaluate the effects of l-arginine  on photomicrographs and hsp <dig> expression in the liver of weanling piglets. twelve healthy landrace × yorkshire piglets that had been weaned at  <dig> d  were randomly divided into a control group and an arg group . at age  <dig> d, all of the piglets were slaughtered to obtain liver samples to determine hsp <dig> expression by real-time pcr, western blot and immunohistochemistry.


RESULTS
the results showed that, compared to control piglets, treatment with arg decreased inflammatory reactions caused by weaning. the immunohistochemical localization of hsp <dig> in liver revealed strong expression in the arg group. arg increased hsp <dig> mrna and hsp <dig> expression in the liver .


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that dietary supplementation with arg could maintain liver health by inducing hsp <dig> expression in weanling piglets.
