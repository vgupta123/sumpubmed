BACKGROUND
image-based screens can produce hundreds of measured features for each of hundreds of millions of individual cells in a single experiment.


RESULTS
here, we describe cellprofiler analyst, open-source software for the interactive exploration and analysis of multidimensional data, particularly data from high-throughput, image-based experiments.


CONCLUSIONS
the system enables interactive data exploration for image-based screens and automated scoring of complex phenotypes that require combinations of multiple measured features per cell.
