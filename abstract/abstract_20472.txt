BACKGROUND
during the last few years, pcr-based methods have been developed to simplify and reduce the time required for genotyping mycobacterium tuberculosis  by standard approaches based on is6110-restriction fragment length polymorphism . of these, miru-12-vntr   has been considered a good alternative. nevertheless, some limitations and discrepancies with rflp, which are minimized if the technique is complemented with spoligotyping, have been found. recently, a new version of miru-vntr targeting  <dig> loci  has been proposed to improve the miru- <dig> format.


RESULTS
we evaluated the new miru- <dig> tool in two different samples. first, we analyzed the same convenience sample that had been used to evaluate miru- <dig> in a previous study, and the new 15-loci version offered higher discriminatory power  and better correlation . second, we evaluated miru- <dig> on a population-based sample and, once again, good correlation with the rflp clustering data was observed . to understand the meaning of the discrepancies still found between miru- <dig> and rflp, we analyzed the epidemiological data for the clustered patients. in most cases, splitting of rflp-clustered patients by miru- <dig> occurred for those without epidemiological links, and rflp-clustered patients with epidemiological links were also clustered by miru- <dig>  suggesting a good epidemiological background for clustering defined by miru- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the data obtained by miru- <dig> suggest that the new design is very efficient at assigning clusters confirmed by epidemiological data. if we add this to the speed with which it provides results, miru- <dig> could be considered a suitable tool for real-time genotyping.
