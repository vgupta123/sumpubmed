BACKGROUND
burkholderia pseudomallei and burkholderia mallei cause the diseases melioidosis and glanders, respectively. a well-studied aspect of pathogenesis by these closely-related bacteria is their ability to invade and multiply within eukaryotic cells. in contrast, the means by which b. pseudomallei and b. mallei adhere to cells are poorly defined. the purpose of this study was to identify adherence factors expressed by these organisms.


RESULTS
comparative sequence analyses identified a gene product in the published genome of b. mallei strain atcc <dig>  that resembles the well-characterized yersinia enterocolitica autotransporter adhesin yada. the gene encoding this b. mallei protein, designated boaa, was expressed in escherichia coli and shown to significantly increase adherence to human epithelial cell lines, specifically hep <dig>  and a <dig> , as well as to cultures of normal human bronchial epithelium . consistent with these findings, disruption of the boaa gene in b. mallei atcc <dig> reduced adherence to all three cell types by ~50%. the genomes of the b. pseudomallei strains k <dig> and dd <dig> were also found to contain boaa and inactivation of the gene in dd <dig> considerably decreased binding to monolayers of hep <dig> and a <dig> cells and to nhbe cultures.

a second yada-like gene product highly similar to boaa  was identified in the published genomic sequence of b. pseudomallei strain k <dig> . the gene specifying this protein, termed boab, appears to be b. pseudomallei-specific. quantitative attachment assays demonstrated that recombinant e. coli expressing boab displayed greater binding to a <dig> pneumocytes, hep <dig> cells and nhbe cultures. moreover, a boab mutant of b. pseudomallei dd <dig> showed decreased adherence to these respiratory cells. additionally, a b. pseudomallei strain lacking expression of both boaa and boab was impaired in its ability to thrive inside j774a. <dig> murine macrophages, suggesting a possible role for these proteins in survival within professional phagocytic cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the boaa and boab genes specify adhesins that mediate adherence to epithelial cells of the human respiratory tract. the boaa gene product is shared by b. pseudomallei and b. mallei whereas boab appears to be a b. pseudomallei-specific adherence factor.
