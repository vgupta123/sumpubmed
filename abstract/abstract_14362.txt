BACKGROUND
the disease caused by haemonchus contortus, a blood-feeding nematode of small ruminants, is of major economic importance worldwide. the infective third-stage larva  of this gastric nematode is enclosed in a cuticle  and, once ingested with herbage by the host, undergoes an exsheathment process that marks the transition from the free-living  to the parasitic  stage. this study explored changes in gene transcription associated with this transition and predicted, based on comparative analysis, functional roles for key transcripts in the metabolic pathways linked to larval development.


RESULTS
totals of  <dig>   and  <dig>   expressed sequence tags  were determined using  <dig> sequencing technology, and then assembled and annotated; the most abundant transcripts encoded transthyretin-like, calcium-binding ef-hand, nad-binding and nucleotide-binding proteins as well as homologues of ancylostoma-secreted proteins . using an in silico-subtractive analysis,  <dig> and  <dig> sequences were shown to be uniquely represented in the l <dig> and xl <dig> stages, respectively; the transcripts encoded ribosomal proteins, collagens and elongation factors , and mainly peptidases and other enzymes of amino acid catabolism . caenorhabditis elegans orthologues of transcripts that were uniquely transcribed in each l <dig> and xl <dig> were predicted to interact with a total of  <dig> other genes, all of which were involved in embryonic development.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study indicated that some key transcriptional alterations taking place during the transition from the l <dig> to the xl <dig> stage of h. contortus involve genes predicted to be linked to the development of neuronal tissue , formation of the cuticle  and digestion of host haemoglobin . future efforts using next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic technologies should provide the efficiency and depth of coverage required for the determination of the complete transcriptomes of different developmental stages and/or tissues of h. contortus as well as the genome of this important parasitic nematode. such advances should lead to a significantly improved understanding of the molecular biology of h. contortus and, from an applied perspective, to novel methods of intervention.
