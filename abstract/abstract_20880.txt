BACKGROUND

enterocytozoon hepatopenaei  causes hepatopancreatic microsporidiosis  in shrimp. it is probably endemic in australasia and was first characterized and named from the giant or black tiger shrimp penaeus monodon from thailand in  <dig>  later, it was also found to infect exotic penaeus vannamei imported for cultivation in asia. hpm is not normally associated with shrimp mortality, but information from shrimp farmers indicates that it is associated with significant growth retardation that is not clearly noticeable until 2– <dig> months of cultivation. in order to study modes of hpm transmission and to test possible control measures, a laboratory challenge model was needed that would mimic the mode of infection in shrimp ponds.


RESULTS
we describe successful transmission in a cohabitation model with natural e. hepatopenaei -infected shrimp in closed, perforated plastic containers placed in aquaria together with free-swimming, uninfected shrimp. after a period of 14 days all the free-swimming shrimp tested positive by pcr  and gave positive histological and in situ hybridization results for e. hepatopenaei  in the hepatopancreas.


CONCLUSIONS
a laboratory cohabitation model for studying e. hepatopenaei  has been developed and used to confirm that e. hepatopenaei  can be directly transmitted horizontally among shrimp via water. the model will facilitate studies on methods to prevent the e. hepatopenaei  transmission.
