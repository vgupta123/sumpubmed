BACKGROUND
currently, most tests of differential gene expression using affymetrix expression array data are performed using expression summary values representing each probe set on a microarray. recently testing methods have been proposed which incorporate probe level information. we propose a new approach that uses fisher's method of combining evidence from multiple sources of information. specifically, we combine p-values from probe level tests of significance.


RESULTS
the combined p method and other competing methods were compared using three spike-in datasets  and array data from a biological study validated with qrt-pcr. based on power and false discovery rates computed for the spike-in datasets, we demonstrate that the combined p method compares favorably with other methods. we find that probe level testing methods select many of the same genes as differentially expressed. we illustrate the use of the combined p method for diagnostic purposes using examples.


CONCLUSIONS
combined p is a promising alternative to existing methods of testing for differential gene expression. in addition, the combined p method is particularly well suited as a diagnostic tool for exploratory analysis of microarray data.
