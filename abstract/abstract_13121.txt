BACKGROUND
although the effects of p deficiency on tea  o. kuntze) growth, p uptake and utilization as well as leaf gas exchange and chl a fluorescence have been investigated, very little is known about the effects of p deficiency on photosynthetic electron transport, photosynthetic enzymes and carbohydrates of tea leaves. in this study, own-rooted 10-month-old tea trees were supplied three times weekly for  <dig> weeks with  <dig> ml of nutrient solution at a p concentration of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> μm. this objective of this study was to determine how p deficiency affects co <dig> assimilation, rubisco, carbohydrates and photosynthetic electron transport in tea leaves to understand the mechanism by which p deficiency leads to a decrease in co <dig> assimilation.


RESULTS
both root and shoot dry weight increased as p supply increased from  <dig> to  <dig> μm, then remained unchanged. p-deficient leaves from  <dig> to  <dig> μm p-treated trees showed decreased co <dig> assimilation and stomatal conductance, but increased intercellular co <dig> concentration. both initial and total rubisco activity, contents of chl and total soluble protein in p-deficient leaves decreased to a lesser extent than co <dig> assimilation. contents of sucrose and starch were decreased in p-deficient leaves, whereas contents of glucose and fructose did not change significantly except for a significant increase in the lowest p leaves. ojip transients from p-deficient leaves displayed a rise at the o-step and a depression at the p-step, accompanied by two new steps at about  <dig> μs  and at about  <dig> μs . rc/cso, tro/abs , eto/abs, reo/abs, maximum amplitude of ip phase, piabs and pitot, abs were decreased in p-deficient leaves, while vj, vi and dissipated energy were increased.


CONCLUSIONS
p deficiency decreased photosynthetic electron transport capacity by impairing the whole electron transport chain from the psii donor side up to the psi, thus decreasing atp content which limits rubp regeneration, and hence, the rate of co <dig> assimilation. energy dissipation is enhanced to protect p-deficient leaves from photo-oxidative damage in high light.
