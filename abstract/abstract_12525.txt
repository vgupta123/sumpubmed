BACKGROUND
understanding the mechanism of low cd accumulation in crops is crucial for sustainable safe food production in cd-contaminated soils.


RESULTS
confocal microscopy, atomic absorption spectrometry, gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence analyses revealed a distinct difference in cd accumulation and tolerance between the two contrasting barley genotypes: w6nk <dig>  and zhenong <dig> . a dna microarray analysis detected large-scale changes of gene expression in response to cd stress with a substantial difference between the two genotypes. cd stress led to higher expression of genes involved in transport, carbohydrate metabolism and signal transduction in the low-grain-cd-accumulating genotype. novel transporter genes such as zinc transporter genes were identified as being associated with low cd accumulation. quantitative rt-pcr confirmed our microarray data. furthermore, suppression of the zinc transporter genes hvzip <dig> and hvzip <dig> by rnai silencing showed increased cd accumulation and reduced zn and mn concentrations in barley grains. thus, hvzip <dig> and hvzip <dig> could be candidate genes related to low-grain-cd-accumulation.


CONCLUSIONS
novel transporter genes such as hvzip <dig> and hvzip <dig> were identified as being associated with low-grain-cd-accumulation. in addition to advancing academic knowledge, our findings may also result in potential economic benefits for molecular breeding of low cd accumulating barley and other crops.
