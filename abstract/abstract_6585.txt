BACKGROUND
comparative genomics is a powerful means of establishing inter-specific relationships between gene function/location and allows insight into genomic rearrangements, conservation and evolutionary phylogeny. the availability of the complete sequence of the chicken genome has initiated the development of detailed genomic information in other birds including turkey, an agriculturally important species where mapping has hitherto focused on linkage with limited physical information. no molecular study has yet examined conservation of avian microchromosomes, nor differences in copy number variants  between birds.


RESULTS
we present a detailed comparative cytogenetic map between chicken and turkey based on reciprocal chromosome painting and mapping of  <dig> chicken bacs to turkey metaphases. two inter-chromosomal changes  and three pericentric inversions have been identified between chicken and turkey; and array cgh identified  <dig> inter-specific cnvs.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study to combine the modalities of zoo-fish and array cgh between different avian species. the first insight into the conservation of microchromosomes, the first comparative cytogenetic map of any bird and the first appraisal of cnvs between birds is provided. results suggest that avian genomes have remained relatively stable during evolution compared to mammalian equivalents.
