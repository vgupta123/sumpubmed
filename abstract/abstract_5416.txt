BACKGROUND
using plant viruses to produce desirable proteins in plants allows for using non-transgenic plant hosts and if necessary, the ability to make rapid changes in the virus construct for increased or modified protein product yields. the objective of this work was the development of advanced cmv-based protein production systems to produce acidothermus cellulolyticus endo- <dig>  4-β-glucanase  in non-transgenic plants.


RESULTS
we used two new cucumber mosaic virus -based vector systems for producing the green fluorescent protein  and more importantly, the acidothermus cellulolyticus endo- <dig>  4-β-glucanase  in non-transgenic nicotiana benthamiana plants. these are the inducible cmvin  and the autonomously replicating cmvar  systems. we modified a binary plasmid containing the complete cmv rna  <dig> cdna to facilitate insertion of desired sequences, and to give modifications of the subgenomic mrna  <dig> leader sequence yielding several variants. quantitative rt-pcr and immunoblot analysis showed good levels of cmv rna and coat protein accumulation for some variants of both cmvin and cmvar. when genes for e <dig> or gfp were inserted in place of the cmv coat protein, both were produced in plants as shown by fluorescence  and immunoblot analysis. enzymatic activity assays showed that active e <dig> was produced in plants with yields up to ~ 11 μg/g fresh weight  for specific variant constructs. we also compared in vitro cmv genomic rna reassortants, and cmv rna  <dig> mutants which lacked the c’ terminal  <dig> amino acids of the 3a movement protein in attempts to further increase e <dig> yield. taken together specific variant constructs yielded up to ~21 μg/g fw of e <dig> in non-transgenic plants.


CONCLUSIONS
intact, active e <dig> was rapidly produced in non-transgenic plants by using agroinfiltration with the cmv-based systems. this reduces the time and cost compared to that required to generate transgenic plants and still gives the comparable yields of active e <dig>  our modifications described here, including manipulating cloning sites for foreign gene introduction, enhance the ease of use. also, n. benthamiana, which is particularly suitable for agroinfiltration, is a very good plant for transient protein production.
