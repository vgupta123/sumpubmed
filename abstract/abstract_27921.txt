BACKGROUND
plants respond to extracellularly perceived abiotic stresses such as low temperature, drought, and salinity by activation of complex intracellular signaling cascades that regulate acclimatory biochemical and physiological changes. protein kinases are major signal transduction factors that have a central role in mediating acclimation to environmental changes in eukaryotic organisms. in this study, we characterized the function of the sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase <dig>  sapk <dig> in the salt stress response of rice.


RESULTS
translational fusion of sapk <dig> with the green fluorescent protein  showed subcellular localization in cytoplasm and nucleus. to examine the role of sapk <dig> in salt tolerance we generated transgenic rice plants with over-expression of rice sapk <dig> under control of the camv-35s promoter. induced expression of sapk <dig> resulted in improved germination, growth and development under salt stress both in seedlings and mature plants. in response to salt stress, the sapk4-overexpressing rice accumulated less na+ and cl- and showed improved photosynthesis. sapk4-regulated genes with functions in ion homeostasis and oxidative stress response were identified: the vacuolar h+-atpase, the na+/h+ antiporter nhx <dig>  the cl- channel osclc <dig> and a catalase.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that sapk <dig> regulates ion homeostasis and growth and development under salinity and suggest function of sapk <dig> as a regulatory factor in plant salt stress acclimation. identification of signaling elements involved in stress adaptation in plants presents a powerful approach to identify transcriptional activators of adaptive mechanisms to environmental changes that have the potential to improve tolerance in crop plants.
