BACKGROUND
the polo-like kinases  are a group of serine/threonine kinases which have roles in many aspects of cellular function including the regulation of mitotic activity and cellular stress responses. this study focuses on plk <dig>  the most divergent member of the plk family, which is necessary for proper cellular proliferation. more specifically, alterations in plk <dig> levels cause significantly adverse mitotic defects including abnormal centrosome duplication and aberrant mitotic spindle formation. we sought to clarify the effect of reduced plk <dig> levels on the cell by examining transcript profiles of plk <dig> wild-type and heterozygous mouse embryonic fibroblasts . subsequently, the levels of several key proteins involved in the dna damage response were examined.


RESULTS
 <dig> genes were found to be significantly up-regulated in the heterozygous mefs compared to their wild-type counterparts, while conversely,  <dig> genes were down-regulated. numerous genes with increased transcript levels in heterozygous mefs were identified to be involved in p53-dependent pathways. furthermore, examination of the promoter regions of all up- and down-regulated genes revealed that the majority contained putative p <dig> responsive elements.

an analysis of transcript levels in mefs after exposure to either ionizing or ultraviolet radiation revealed a significant change between wild type and heterozygous mefs for plk <dig> transcript levels upon only uv exposure. furthermore, changes in protein levels of several important cell check-point and apoptosis regulators were examined, including p <dig>  chk <dig>  chk <dig>  cdc25c and p <dig>  in heterozygous mefs, p <dig>  p <dig> and chk <dig> protein levels were at significantly higher levels. furthermore, p <dig> activity was increased  <dig> fold in the plk <dig> heterozygous mefs.


CONCLUSIONS
global transcript profiles and levels of key proteins involved in cellular proliferation and dna damage pathways were examined in wild-type and plk <dig> heterozygous mefs. it was determined that plk <dig> haploinsufficiency leads to changes in the levels of rna accumulation for a number of key cellular genes as well as changes in protein levels for several important cell cycle/dna damage proteins. we propose a model in which reduced plk <dig> levels invoke an increase in p <dig> levels that leads to the aforementioned changes in global transcription profiles.
