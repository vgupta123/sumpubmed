BACKGROUND
the efficacy, potency, and selectivity of the compound 2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine , a nominally selective agonist for metabotropic glutamate receptor  <dig> , were examined with select mglurs by examining their ability to induce modulation of the native voltage dependent ion channels in isolated sympathetic neurons from the rat superior cervical ganglion . scg neurons offer a null mglur-background in which specific mglur subtypes can be made to express via intranuclear cdna injection.


RESULTS
consistent with previous reports, chpg strongly activated mglur5b expressed in scg neurons with an apparent ec <dig> around 60 μm. surprisingly, chpg also activated two mglur <dig> splice variants with a similar potency as at mglur <dig> when calcium current inhibition was used as an assay for receptor function. no effect of 1 mm chpg was seen in cells expressing mglur <dig> or mglur <dig>  suggesting that chpg only activates group i mglurs . chpg was also able to induce modulation of m-type potassium current through mglur <dig>  but not as consistently as glutamate. since this channel is modulated through a gq-dependent pathway, these data indicate that chpg may exhibit some biased agonist properties on mglur <dig>  closer examination of the voltage-independent, gq-mediated component of mglur-induced calcium current modulation data confirmed that some biased agonism was evident, but the effect was weak and inconsistent.


CONCLUSIONS
these data contrast with the established literature which suggests that chpg is a selective mglur <dig> agonist. instead, chpg appears to act equally well as an agonist at mglur <dig>  while some weak biased agonism was observed with chpg acting on mglur <dig>  but not mglur <dig>  favoring gi/o signaling over gq/ <dig>  this effect does not appear sufficient to fully explain the discrepancies in the literature.
