BACKGROUND
the neuregulin family of ligands and their receptors, the erbb tyrosine kinases, have important roles in epidermal and mammary gland development as well as during carcinogenesis. previously, we demonstrated that neuregulin <dig>  is a specification signal for mammary placode formation in mice. nrg <dig> is a growth factor, which binds and activates erbb <dig>  a receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. to understand the role of neuregulin <dig> in epidermal morphogenesis, we have developed a transgenic mouse model that expresses nrg <dig> throughout the basal layer  of mouse epidermis and the outer root sheath of developing hair follicles.


RESULTS
transgenic females formed supernumerary nipples and mammary glands along and adjacent to the mammary line providing strong evidence that nrg <dig> has a role in the initiation of mammary placodes along the body axis. in addition, alterations in morphogenesis and differentiation of other epidermal appendages were observed, including the hair follicles. the transgenic epidermis is hyperplastic with excessive sebaceous differentiation and shows striking similarities to mouse models in which c-myc is activated in the basal layer including decreased expression levels of the adhesion receptors, α6-integrin and β1-integrin.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that the epidermis is sensitive to nrg <dig> signaling, and that this growth factor can regulate cell fate of pluripotent epidermal cell populations including that of the mammary gland. nrg <dig> appears to act, in part, by inducing c-myc, altering the proliferation and adhesion properties of the basal epidermis, and may promote exit from the stem cell compartment. the results we describe provide significant insight into how growth factors, such as nrg <dig>  regulate epidermal homeostasis by influencing the balance between stem cell renewal, lineage selection and differentiation.
