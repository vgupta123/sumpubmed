BACKGROUND
the transcription factor nfat5/tonebp regulates the response of mammalian cells to hypertonicity. however, little is known about the physiopathologic tonicity thresholds that trigger its transcriptional activity in primary cells. wilkins et al. recently developed a transgenic mouse carrying a luciferase reporter  driven by a cluster of nfat sites, that was activated by calcineurin-dependent nfatc proteins. since the nfat site of this reporter was very similar to an optimal nfat <dig> site, we tested whether this reporter could detect the activation of nfat <dig> in transgenic cells.


RESULTS
the 9xnfat-luc reporter was activated by hypertonicity in an nfat5-dependent manner in different types of non-transformed transgenic cells: lymphocytes, macrophages and fibroblasts. activation of this reporter by the phorbol ester pma plus ionomycin was independent of nfat <dig> and mediated by nfatc proteins. transcriptional activation of nfat <dig> in t lymphocytes was detected at hypertonic conditions of 360– <dig> mosm/kg  and strongly induced at  <dig> mosm/kg. such levels have been recorded in plasma in patients with osmoregulatory disorders and in mice deficient in aquaporins and vasopressin receptor. the hypertonicity threshold required to activate nfat <dig> was higher in bone marrow-derived macrophages  and embryonic fibroblasts . activation of the 9xnfat-luc reporter by hypertonicity in lymphocytes was insensitive to the erk inhibitor pd <dig>  partially inhibited by the pi3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin  and the pka inhibitor h <dig>  and substantially downregulated by p <dig> inhibitors  and by inhibition of pi3-kinase-related kinases with  <dig> μm ly <dig>  sensitivity of the reporter to fk <dig> varied among cell types and was greater in primary t cells than in fibroblasts and macrophages.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that nfat <dig> is a sensitive responder to pathologic increases in extracellular tonicity in t lymphocytes. activation of nfat <dig> by hypertonicity in lymphocytes was mediated by a combination of signaling pathways that differed from those required in other cell types. we propose that the 9xnfat-luc transgenic mouse model might be useful to study the physiopathological regulation of both nfat <dig> and nfatc factors in primary cells.
