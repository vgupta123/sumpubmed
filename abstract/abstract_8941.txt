BACKGROUND
carbon monoxide , a byproduct of heme degradation, is attracting growing attention from the scientific community. at physiological concentrations, co plays a role as a signal messenger that regulates a number of physiological processes. co releasing molecules are under evaluation in preclinical models for the management of inflammation, sepsis, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and organ transplantation. because of our discovery that nitric oxide signaling actively down-regulates integrin affinity and cell adhesion, and the similarity between nitric oxide and co-dependent signaling, we studied the effects of co on integrin signaling and cell adhesion.


RESULTS
we used a cell permeable co releasing molecule  to elevate intracellular co, and a fluorescent very late antigen- <dig> -specific ligand to evaluate the integrin state in real-time on live cells. we show that the binding of the ligand can be rapidly down-modulated in resting cells and after inside-out activation through several gαi-coupled receptors. moreover, cell treatment with hemin, a natural source of co, resulted in comparable vla- <dig> ligand dissociation. inhibition of vla- <dig> ligand binding by co had a dramatic effect on cell-cell interaction in a vla-4/vcam-1-dependent cell adhesion system.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the co signaling pathway can rapidly down-modulate binding of the vla- <dig> -specific ligand. we propose that co-regulated integrin deactivation provides a basis for modulation of immune cell adhesion as well as rapid cell mobilization, for example as shown for splenic monocytes in response to surgically induced ischemia of the myocardium.
