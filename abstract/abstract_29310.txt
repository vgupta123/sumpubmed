BACKGROUND
recent data suggest that ribonucleotide reductase  exists not only as a heterodimer r12r <dig> of r <dig> and r <dig> homodimers, but also as tetramers r14r <dig> and hexamers r16r <dig>  recent data also suggest that atp binds the r <dig> subunit at a previously undescribed hexamerization site, in addition to its binding to previously described dimerization and tetramerization sites. thus, the current view is that r <dig> has four ndp substrate binding possibilities, four dimerization site binding possibilities , two tetramerization site binding possibilities , and one hexamerization site binding possibility , in addition to possibilities of unbound site states. this large number of internal r <dig> states implies an even larger number of quaternary states. a mathematical model of rnr activity which explicitly represents the states of r <dig> currently exists, but it is complicated in several ways:  it includes up to six-fold nested sums;  it uses different mathematical structures under different substrate-modulator conditions; and  it requires root solutions of high order polynomials to determine r <dig> proportions in mono-, di-, tetra- and hexamer states and thus rnr activity as a function of modulator and total r <dig> concentrations.


RESULTS
we present four  rational polynomial models of rnr activity as a function of substrate and reaction rate modifier concentrations. the new models avoid the complications of the earlier model without compromising curve fits to recent data.


CONCLUSIONS
compared to the earlier model of recent data, the new rational polynomial models are simpler, adequately fitting, and likely better suited for biochemical network simulations.
