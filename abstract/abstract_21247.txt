BACKGROUND
the intensive use of anthelmintics for the control of helminthic infections has resulted in the development of anthelmintic resistance, which has become a major practical problem in many countries. a variety of tests are available to monitor anthelmintic resistance but most of them are expensive, laborious and time consuming and therefore unpractical for large field surveys. the main aim of this survey was thus to detect the occurrence of benzimidazole  and macrocyclic lactone resistance on sheep farms in slovakia by using novel and modified in vitro methods that are inexpensive, easy to use and quick and therefore practical for large surveys.


RESULTS
bz-resistant gastrointestinal nematodes were found on all  <dig> farms. two farms  had high levels of resistance , and  <dig> farms had low levels  of resistant nematodes. ivm-resistant populations were found on  <dig> of  <dig> sheep farms. the prevalence of bz and ivm resistance has slightly increased on slovak sheep farms during the last two decades.


CONCLUSIONS
both the bz and ivm surveys indicated that resistance against anthelmintics was present on slovak sheep farms. resistance against the bz class of anthelmintics had been stable for two decades, but a slight increase on ivm resistance was confirmed. farmers must thus observe the preventive measures to avoid a faster onset of ivm resistance, otherwise the presence of resistant parasites and ineffective treatment may harm the economy of their farms.
