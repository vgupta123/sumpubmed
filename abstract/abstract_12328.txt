BACKGROUND
prevotella intermedia , a gram-negative, black-pigmented anaerobic rod, has been implicated in the development of chronic oral infection. p. intermedia strain  <dig> was isolated from a chronic periodontitis lesion in our laboratory and described as a viscous material producing strain. the stock cultures of this strain still maintain the ability to produce large amounts of viscous materials in the spent culture media and form biofilm-like structures. chemical analyses of this viscous material showed that they were mainly composed of neutral sugars with mannose constituting 83% of the polysaccharides. to examine the biological effect of the extracellular viscous materials, we identified and obtained a naturally-occurring variant strain that lacked the ability to produce viscous materials in vitro from our stock culture collections of strain  <dig>  designated as 17- <dig>  we compared these two strains  in terms of their capacities to form biofilms and to induce abscess formation in mice as an indication of their pathogenicity. further, gene expression profiles between these two strains in planktonic condition and gene expression patterns of strain  <dig> in solid and liquid cultures were also compared using microarray assays.


RESULTS
strain  <dig> induced greater abscess formation in mice as compared to that of the variant. strain  <dig>  but not 17- <dig> showed an ability to interfere with the phagocytic activity of human neutrophils. expression of several genes which including those for heat shock proteins  were up-regulated two to four-fold with statistical significance in biofilm-forming strain  <dig> as compared to the variant strain 17- <dig>  strain  <dig> in solid culture condition exhibited more than eight-fold up-regulated expression levels of several genes which including those for levanase, extracytoplasmic function-subfamily sigma factor  and polysialic acid transport protein , as compared to those of strain  <dig> in liquid culture media.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate that the capacity to form biofilm in p. intermedia contribute to their resistance against host innate defence responses.
