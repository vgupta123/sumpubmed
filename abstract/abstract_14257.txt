BACKGROUND
the production of extended-spectrum β-lactamases  confer resistance to the commonly used beta-lactam antimicrobials and esbl–producing bacteria render treatment difficulty in human and veterinary medicine. esbl–producing bacteria have emerged in livestock in recent years, which may raise concerns regarding possible transfer of such bacteria through the food chain. the swine industry is important in taiwan, but investigations regarding the status of esbl in swine are limited.


RESULTS
we collected  <dig> fecal swab samples from piglets with diarrhea in  <dig> swine farms located in central and southern taiwan from january to december  <dig> and screened them for esbl–producing escherichia coli. esbl producers were confirmed phenotypically by combination disc test and genotypically by polymerase chain reaction and dna sequencing. the occurrence rate of esbl–producing e. coli was  <dig> % , and all were obtained in swine farms located in southern taiwan. bla
ctx-m-1-group and bla
ctx-m-9-group were the two bla
ctx-m groups found. bla
ctx-m- <dig>  and bla
ctx-m- <dig> , which belong to the bla
ctx-m-1-group, were the two major bla gene types, whereas bla
ctx-m- <dig> was the only type found in the bla
ctx-m- <dig> group. twenty-seven strains contained bla
tem- <dig>  and the other  <dig> strains contained bla
tem- <dig>  one strain found in pingtung harbored three bla genes: bla
tem- <dig>  bla
ctx-m- <dig>  and bla
ctx-m- <dig>  esbl–producing e. coli exhibited a multidrug-resistant phenotype, and multilocus sequence typing revealed that the st <dig> clonal complexes, including st <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> accounted for 35%  of these strains.


CONCLUSIONS
esbl-producing e. coli from piglets with diarrhea were isolated from swine farms located in southern taiwan. the most commonly detected bla were bla
ctx-m- <dig> and bla
ctx-m- <dig>  the st <dig> clonal complexes comprised most of our esbl-producing e. coli strains. fecal shedding from swine may contaminate the environment, resulting in public health concerns; thus, continued surveillance of esbl is essential in swine and in other food animals.
