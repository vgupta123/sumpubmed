BACKGROUND
mechanized dry seeded rice can save both labour and water resources. rice seedling establishment is sensitive to sowing depth while mesocotyl elongation facilitates the emergence of deeply sown seeds.


RESULTS
a set of  <dig> rice accessions, including  <dig> from the mini-core collection of chinese rice germplasm  and  <dig> varieties used in a breeding program for drought resistance , was screened for mesocotyl lengths of seedlings grown in water  in darkness and in 5 cm sand culture . twenty six accessions  have mlw longer than  <dig>  cm. eleven accessions had the highest mesocotyl lengths, i.e.  <dig>  –  <dig>  cm of mlw and  <dig>  –  <dig>  cm in 10 cm sand culture, including  <dig> upland landraces or varieties. the genotypic data of  <dig> , <dig> snps were developed by re-sequencing of those accessions. a whole-genome snp array  was used to genotype  <dig> accessions as a validation panel, giving  <dig>  % of consistent snps with the re-sequencing data in average. gwas based on compressed mixed linear model was conducted using gapit. based on a threshold of -log ≥ <dig> ,  <dig> loci were associated to mlw on rice chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. three associated loci, on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  were detected for mls. a set of  <dig> associated snps for mlw, based on a compromised threshold  ≥ <dig> ), located in intergenic regions or different positions of  <dig> annotated genes, including one cullin and one growth regulating factor gene.


CONCLUSIONS
higher proportion and extension of elongated mesocotyls were observed in the mini-core collection of rice germplasm and upland rice landraces or varieties, possibly causing the correlation between mesocotyl elongation and drought resistance. gwas found  <dig> loci for mesocotyl length measured in dark germination that confirmed the previously reported co-location of two qtls across populations and experiments. associated snps hit  <dig> annotated genes including function-matching candidates like cullin and grf. the germplasm with elongated mesocotyl, especially upland landraces or varieties, and the associated snps could be useful in further studies and breeding of mechanized dry seeded rice.
