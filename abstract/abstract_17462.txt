BACKGROUND
aegilops variabilis no. <dig> is highly resistant to cereal cyst nematode . however, a lack of genomic information has restricted studies on ccn resistance genes in ae. variabilis and has limited genetic applications in wheat breeding.


RESULTS
using rna-seq technology, we generated a root transcriptome at a sequencing depth of  <dig>  gigabases of ae. variabilis no.  <dig> from a pooled rna sample. the sample contained equal amounts of rna extracted from ccn-infected and untreated control plants at three time-points. using the trinity method, nearly  <dig> , <dig> high-quality trimmed reads were assembled into a non-redundant set of  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of 500 bp and an n <dig> of 599 bp. the total assembly was  <dig>  mb of unique transcriptome sequences with average read-depth coverage of  <dig> ×. in blast searches of our database against public databases,  <dig> %  of the unigenes were annotated with gene descriptions, conserved protein domains, or gene ontology terms. functional categorization further revealed  <dig>  individual unigenes and three pathways related to plant stress resistance.


CONCLUSIONS
we conducted high-resolution transcriptome profiling related to root development and the response to ccn infection in ae. variabilis no. <dig>  this research facilitates further studies on gene discovery and on the molecular mechanisms related to ccn resistance.
