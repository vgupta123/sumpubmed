BACKGROUND
retrotransposons are a major component of the human genome constituting as much as 45%. the hominid specific sine-vntr-alus are the youngest of these elements constituting  <dig> % of the genome; they are therefore a practical and amenable group for analysis of both their global integration, polymorphic variation and their potential contribution to modulation of genome regulation.


RESULTS
consistent with insertion into active chromatin we have determined that svas are more prevalent in genic regions compared to gene deserts. the consequence of which, is that their integration has greater potential to have affects on gene regulation. the sequences of svas show potential for the formation of secondary structure including g-quadruplex dna. we have shown that the human specific sva subtypes  show the greatest potential for forming g-quadruplexes within the central tandem repeat component in addition to the 5’ ‘ccctct’ hexamer. we undertook a detailed analysis of the park <dig> sva d, located in the promoter of the park <dig> gene , in a hapmap cohort where we identified  <dig> variable number tandem repeat domains and  <dig> tandem repeat within this sva with the 5’ ccctct element being one of the variable regions. functionally we were able to demonstrate that this sva contains multiple regulatory elements that support reporter gene expression in vitro and further show these elements exhibit orientation dependency.


CONCLUSIONS
our data supports the hypothesis that svas integrate preferentially in to open chromatin where they could modify the existing transcriptional regulatory domains or alter expression patterns by a variety of mechanisms.
