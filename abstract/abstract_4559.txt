BACKGROUND
cyclooxygenase- <dig>  and the bombesin -like peptide, gastrin-releasing peptide , have been implicated in the progression of hormone-refractory prostate cancer; however, a mechanistic link between the bioactive peptide and cox- <dig> expression in prostate cells has not been made.


RESULTS
we report that bbs stimulates cox- <dig> mrna and protein expression, and the release of prostaglandin e <dig> from the grp receptor -positive, androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cell line, pc- <dig>  bbs-stimulated cox- <dig> expression is mediated, in part, by p38mapk and pi <dig> kinase /akt pathways, and blocked by a grpr antagonist. the pi3k/akt pathway couples grpr to the transcription factor, activator protein- <dig> , and enhanced cox- <dig> promoter activity. although bbs stimulates nuclear factor-kappab  in pc- <dig>  nf-Îºb does not regulate grpr-mediated cox- <dig> expression. the p38mapk pathway increases bbs-stimulated cox- <dig> expression by slowing the degradation of cox- <dig> mrna. expression of recombinant grpr in the androgen-sensitive cell line lncap is sufficient to confer bbs-stimulated cox- <dig> expression via the p38mapk and pi3k/akt pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
our study establishes a mechanistic link between grpr activation and enhanced cox- <dig> expression in prostate cancer cell lines, and suggests that inhibiting grpr may, in the future, provide an effective therapeutic alternative to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for inhibiting cox- <dig> in patients with recurrent prostate cancer.
