BACKGROUND
lamprosema indicate is a major leaf feeding insect pest to soybean, which has caused serious yield losses in central and southern china. to explore the defense mechanisms of soybean resistance to lamprosema indicate, a highly resistant line  and a highly susceptible line  were exposed to lamprosema indicate larval feedings for 0 h and 48 h, and the differential proteomic analyses of these two lines were carried out.


RESULTS
the results showed that  <dig> differentially expressed proteins  were identified in the gantai-2- <dig> when comparing 48 h feeding with 0 h feeding, and  <dig> deps were identified in the wan 82– <dig>   <dig> deps were identified when comparing gantai-2- <dig> with wan 82– <dig> at 0 h feeding. the bioinformatic analysis results showed that most of the deps were associated with ribosome, linoleic acid metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, peroxisome, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, pant hormone signal transduction, and flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, as well as other resistance related metabolic pathways. the mrm analysis showed that the itraq results were reliable.


CONCLUSIONS
according to the analysis of the deps results, the soybean defended or resisted the lamprosema indicate damage by the induction of a synthesis of anti-digestive proteins which inhibit the growth and development of insects, reactive oxygen species scavenging, signaling pathways, secondary metabolites synthesis, and so on.
