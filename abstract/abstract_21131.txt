BACKGROUND
accumulated evidence suggests that hydrogen peroxide  generated in cells during insulin stimulation plays an integral role in insulin receptor signal transduction. the role of insulin-induced h2o <dig> in neuronal insulin receptor activation and the origin of insulin-induced h2o <dig> in neurons remain unclear. the aim of the present study is to test the following hypotheses  whether insulin-induced h2o <dig> is required for insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons, and  whether mitochondrial respiratory chain is involved in insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> production, thus playing an integral role in insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons.


RESULTS
insulin stimulation elicited rapid insulin receptor autophosphorylation accompanied by an increase in h2o <dig> release from cultured cerebellar granule neurons . n-acetylcysteine , a h2o <dig> scavenger, inhibited both insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> release and insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of insulin receptor. inhibitors of respiratory chain-mediated h2o <dig> production, malonate and carbonyl cyanide-4--phenylhydrazone , inhibited both insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> release from neurons and insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of insulin receptor. dicholine salt of succinic acid, a respiratory substrate, significantly enhanced the effect of suboptimal insulin concentration on the insulin receptor autophosphorylation in cgn.


CONCLUSIONS
results of the present study suggest that insulin-induced h2o <dig> is required for the enhancement of insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons. the mitochondrial respiratory chain is involved in insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> production, thus playing an integral role in the insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons.
