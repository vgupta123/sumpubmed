BACKGROUND
cross-species nuclear transfer has been shown to be a potent approach to retain the genetic viability of a certain species near extinction. however, most embryos produced by cross-species nuclear transfer were compromised because that they were unable to develop to later stages. gene expression analysis of cross-species cloned embryos will yield new insights into the regulatory mechanisms involved in cross-species nuclear transfer and embryonic development.


RESULTS
a novel gene, k <dig>  was identified as an up-regulated gene in fish cross-subfamily cloned embryos using ssh approach and race method. k <dig> complete cdna sequence is  <dig> base pairs  in length, with a  <dig> bp open reading frame  encoding a putative protein of  <dig> amino acids . comparative analysis revealed no homologous known gene in zebrafish and other species database. k <dig> protein contains a putative transmembrane helix and five putative phosphorylation sites but without a signal peptide. expression pattern analysis by real time rt-pcr and whole-mount in situ hybridization  shows that it has the characteristics of constitutively expressed gene. sub-cellular localization assay shows that k <dig> protein can not penetrate the nuclei. interestingly, over-expression of k <dig> gene can cause lethality in the epithelioma papulosum cyprinid  cells in cell culture, which gave hint to the inefficient reprogramming events occurred in cloned embryos.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our findings indicated that k <dig> gene is a novel gene differentially expressed in fish cross-subfamily cloned embryos and over-expression of k <dig> gene can cause lethality of cultured fish cells. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the determination of novel genes involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic interaction of fish cross-subfamily cloned embryos.
