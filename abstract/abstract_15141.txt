BACKGROUND
major changes in gene expression occur in the fetal brain to modulate the function of this organ postnatally. thus, factors can alter the genomics of the fetal brain, predisposing to neurological disorders later in life. we hypothesized that the physiological dynamics of the immune system transcriptome of the fetal brain during the last stage of gestation will reveal patterns of immune function and development in the developing brain. in this study we applied weighted gene co-expression analysis of microarrays performed on ovine fetal brain samples, to model the changes in gene expression throughout the second half of gestation.


RESULTS
clusters of co-expressed genes that strongly increase in expression toward the first day of extra-uterine life are related to the hematopoietic lineage, while activation of immune pathways is induced after birth. moreover, the pattern of gene expression suggests induction of tolerance mechanisms, probably necessary to protect highly produced proteins –such as myelin basic protein- from an autoimmune attack.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides insight into the dramatic changes in gene expression that take place in the brain during the fetal life, especially during the last stage of gestation, and suggests that the immune system may have an important role in maturation of the fetal brain, which if disrupted or altered, could have negative consequences in postnatal life.
