BACKGROUND
recent advances in sociogenomics allow for comparative analyses of molecular mechanisms regulating the development of social behavior. in eusocial insects, one key aspect of their sociality, the division of labor, has received the most attention. age-related polyethism, a derived form of division of labor in ants and bees where colony tasks are allocated among distinct behavioral phenotypes, has traditionally been assumed to be a product of convergent evolution. previous work has shown that the circadian clock is associated with the development of behavior and division of labor in honeybee societies. we cloned the ortholog of the clock gene, period, from a harvester ant  and examined circadian rhythms and daily activity patterns in a species that represents an evolutionary origin of eusociality independent of the honeybee.


RESULTS
using real time qpcr analyses, we determined that harvester ants have a daily cyclic expression of period and this rhythm is endogenous . cyclic expression of period is task-specific; foragers have strong daily fluctuations but nest workers inside the nest do not. these patterns correspond to differences in behavior as activity levels of foragers show a diurnal pattern while nest workers tend to exhibit continuous locomotor activity at lower levels. in addition, we found that foragers collected in the early fall  exhibit a delay in the nightly peak of period expression relative to foragers collected in the early spring .


CONCLUSIONS
the association of period mrna expression levels with harvester ant task behaviors suggests that the development of circadian rhythms is associated with the behavioral development of ants. thus, the circadian clock pathway may represent a conserved 'genetic toolkit' that has facilitated the parallel evolution of age-related polyethism and task allocation in social insects.
