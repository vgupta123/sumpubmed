BACKGROUND
smokers are more prone to oral infections than are non-smokers. cigarette smoke reaches the host cells but also microorganisms present in the oral cavity. the contact between cigarette smoke and oral bacteria promotes such oral diseases as periodontitis. cigarette smoke can also modulate c. albicans activities that promote oral candidiasis. the goal of this study was to investigate the effect of cigarette smoke condensate on c. albicans adhesion, growth, and biofilm formation as well as the activation of eap <dig>  hwp <dig> and secreted aspartic protease  <dig> 


RESULTS
cigarette smoke condensate  increased c. albicans adhesion and growth, as well as biofilm formation. these features may be supported by the activation of certain important genes. using quantitative rt-pcr, we demonstrated that csc-exposed c. albicans expressed high levels of eap <dig>  hwp <dig> and sap <dig> mrna and that this gene expression increased with increasing concentrations of csc.


CONCLUSIONS
csc induction of c. albicans adhesion, growth, and biofilm formation may explain the increased persistence of this pathogen in smokers. these findings may also be relevant to other biofilm-induced oral diseases.
