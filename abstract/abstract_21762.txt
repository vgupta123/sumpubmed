BACKGROUND
human endogenous retroviruses  are surviving traces of ancient retrovirus infections and now reside within the human dna. recently herv expression has been detected in both normal tissues and diseased patients. however, the activities  of individual herv sequences are mostly unknown.


RESULTS
we introduce a generative mixture model, based on hidden markov models, for estimating the activities of the individual herv sequences from est  databases. we use the model to estimate the relative activities of  <dig> hervs. we also empirically justify a faster heuristic method for herv activity estimation and use it to estimate the activities of  <dig> hervs. the majority of the herv activities were previously unknown.


CONCLUSIONS
 our methods estimate activity accurately based on experiments on simulated data.  our estimate on real data shows that 7% of the hervs are active. the active ones are spread unevenly into herv groups and relatively uniformly in terms of estimated age. hervs with the retroviral env gene are more often active than hervs without env. few of the active hervs have open reading frames for retroviral proteins.
