BACKGROUND
the widespread problem of antibiotic resistance in pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus has prompted the search for new antimicrobial approaches. in this study we report for the first time the use of a light-activated antimicrobial agent, methylene blue, to kill an epidemic methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  strain in two mouse wound models.


RESULTS
following irradiation of wounds with  <dig> j/cm <dig> of laser light  in the presence of  <dig> Î¼g/ml of methylene blue, a 25-fold reduction in the number of viable emrsa was seen. this was independent of the increase in temperature of the wounds associated with the treatment. histological examination of the wounds revealed no difference between the photodynamic therapy -treated wounds and the untreated wounds, all of which showed the same degree of inflammatory infiltration at  <dig> hours.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study demonstrate that pdt is effective at reducing the total number of viable emrsa in a wound. this approach has promise as a means of treating wound infections caused by antibiotic-resistant microbes as well as for the elimination of such organisms from carriage sites.
