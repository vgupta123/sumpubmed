BACKGROUND
genomes of men and women differ in only a limited number of genes located on the sex chromosomes, whereas the transcriptome is far more sex-specific. identification of sex-biased gene expression will contribute to understanding the molecular basis of sex-differences in complex traits and common diseases.


RESULTS
sex differences in the human peripheral blood transcriptome were characterized using microarrays in  <dig>  subjects, accounting for menopause status and hormonal contraceptive use. sex-specific expression was observed for  <dig> autosomal genes, of which  <dig> % was upregulated in women . female-biased genes were enriched for several immune system go categories, genes linked to rheumatoid arthritis  and genes regulated by estrogen . male-biased genes were enriched for genes linked to renal cancer . sex-differences in gene expression were smaller in postmenopausal women, larger in women using hormonal contraceptives and not caused by sex-specific eqtls, confirming the role of estrogen in regulating sex-biased genes.


CONCLUSIONS
this study indicates that sex-bias in gene expression is extensive and may underlie sex-differences in the prevalence of common diseases.
