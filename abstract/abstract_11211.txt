BACKGROUND
α-oxoaldehydes are formed as toxic by-products during metabolic activity. the biologically most important compound of this class, methylglyoxal, results from spontaneous phosphate elimination from dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate which are intermediate glycolysis products. methylglyoxal-mediated modification of lipids, nucleic acids and proteins is known to lead to the formation of advanced glycation end products. these modifications contribute to the aetiology of severe diseases like diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. by using simple model organisms it is possible to conveniently study the effects of methylglyoxal on cellular processes. here, results are presented on the effects of methylglyoxal on mycelium growth, stationary phase entry , mitochondrial morphology and protein composition in the filamentous fungus penicillium chrysogenum.


RESULTS
methylglyoxal leads to growth rate reduction of this fungus so that the entry into the stationary phase is delayed. mitochondrial morphology is not changed by methylglyoxal. however, rapamycin-mediated fragmentation of mitochondria is prevented by methylglyoxal. furthermore, three proteins are identified that are present in lower abundance when methylglyoxal is added to the growth medium .


CONCLUSIONS
the presented results contribute to the understanding of cellular pathways and mechanisms that are affected by the ubiquitous α-oxoaldehyde methylglyoxal.
