BACKGROUND
repositioning approved drug and small molecules in novel therapeutic areas is of key interest to the pharmaceutical industry. a number of promising computational techniques have been developed to aid in repositioning, however, the majority of available methodologies require highly specific data inputs that preclude the use of many datasets and databases. there is a clear unmet need for a generalized methodology that enables the integration of multiple types of both gene expression data and database schema.


RESULTS
ksrepo eliminates the need for a single microarray platform as input and allows for the use of a variety of drug and chemical exposure databases. we tested ksrepo’s performance on a set of five prostate cancer datasets using the comparative toxicogenomics database  as our database of gene-compound interactions. ksrepo successfully predicted significance for five frontline prostate cancer therapies, representing a significant enrichment from over  <dig> ctd compounds, and achieved specificity similar to other repositioning methods.


CONCLUSIONS
we present ksrepo, which enables investigators to use any data inputs for computational drug repositioning. ksrepo is implemented in a series of four functions in the r statistical environment under a bsd <dig> license. source code is freely available at http://github.com/adam-sam-brown/ksrepo. a vignette is provided to aid users in performing ksrepo analysis.
