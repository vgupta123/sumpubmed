BACKGROUND
the fossil record of plecoptera  is considered relatively complete, with stem-groups of each of the three major lineages, viz. antarctoperlaria, euholognatha and systellognatha  represented in the mesozoic. however, the family pteronarcyidae  has no fossil record to date, and the family has been suggested to have diverged recently.


RESULTS
in this paper, we report on a set of specimens belonging to a new fossil species of stonefly, discovered from the middle jurassic daohugou locality . our comparative analysis of wing venation and body characters demonstrates that the new species belongs to the pteronarcyidae, and is more closely related to pteronarcys than to pteronarcella. however, it differs from all known species of the former genus. it is therefore assigned to a new genus and named pteroliriope sinitshenkovae
gen. et sp. nov. under the traditional nomenclatural procedure. the cladotypic nomenclatural procedure is also employed, with the resulting combination pteroliriope nec pteronarcys sinitshenkovae
sp. nov.



CONCLUSIONS
the first discovery of a fossil member of the pteronarcyidae demonstrates that the corresponding lineage is not a very recent offshoot but was already present ca.  <dig> million years ago. this discovery concurs with the view that divergence of most stonefly families took place very early, probably in the triassic, or even in the permian. this contribution demonstrates the need for investigations of the systematics of fossil stoneflies to refine divergence date estimates for plecoptera lineages.
