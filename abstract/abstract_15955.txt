BACKGROUND
obesity affects quality of life and life expectancy and is associated with cardiovascular disorders, cancer, diabetes, reproductive disorders in women, prostate diseases in men, and congenital anomalies in children. the use of single nucleotide polymorphism  markers of diseases and drug responses  can help physicians to improve treatment. clinical research can validate snp markers via genotyping of patients and demonstration that snp alleles are significantly more frequent in patients than in healthy people. the search for biomedical snp markers of interest can be accelerated by computer-based analysis of hundreds of millions of snps in the  <dig> genomes project because of selection of the most meaningful candidate snp markers and elimination of neutral snps.


RESULTS
we cross-validated the output of two computer-based methods: dna sequence analysis using web service snp_tata_comparator and keyword search for articles on comorbidities of obesity. near the sites binding to tata-binding protein  in human gene promoters, we found  <dig> obesity-related candidate snp markers, including rs <dig> ; rs <dig> ; rs <dig> ; rs <dig> ; rs <dig> and rs <dig> ; rs <dig> and rs <dig> ; rs <dig>  rs <dig>  and rs <dig> ; and rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  and rs <dig> . using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay under nonequilibrium conditions, we empirically validated the statistical significance  of the differences in tbp affinity values between the minor and ancestral alleles of  <dig> out of the  <dig> snps: rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  and rs <dig>  we also measured half-life , gibbs free energy change , and the association and dissociation rate constants, ka and kd, of the tbp-dna complex for these snps.


CONCLUSIONS
validation of the  <dig> candidate snp markers by proper clinical protocols appears to have a strong rationale and may advance postgenomic predictive preventive personalized medicine.
