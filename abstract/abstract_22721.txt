BACKGROUND
prosthetic joint infection  is an important failure mechanism of total joint arthroplasty . here we examine whether the particular genetic variants can lead to increased susceptibility to pji development.


RESULTS
we conducted a genetic-association study to determine whether pji could be associated with functional cytokine gene polymorphisms  influencing on innate immunity response. a case–control design was utilized and previously published criteria for pji were included to distinguish between cases and control subjects with/without tja. six single nucleotide polymorphisms  located in the genes for interleukin-1beta , tumour necrosis factor alpha  and interleukin- <dig>  were genotyped in  <dig> caucasian  patients with tja , and  <dig> unrelated healthy czech individuals without tja. the results showed that carriers of the less common il1b−511*t allele were overrepresented in the group of tja patients with pji  in comparison with those that did not develop pji  and with healthy controls . there was no significant difference in the distribution of the remaining five investigated cgps and their haplotypes between groups.


CONCLUSIONS
a functional variant of the gene encoding for il-1beta was preliminarily nominated as a genetic factor contributing to the susceptibility to pji. our results should be independently replicated; studies on the functional relevance of il1b gene variants in pji are also needed.
