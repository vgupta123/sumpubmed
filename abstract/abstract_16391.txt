BACKGROUND
reduced representation bisulfite sequencing  was developed to measure dna methylation of high-cg regions at single base-pair resolution, and has been widely used because of its minimal dna requirements and cost efficacy; however, the cpg coverage of genomic regions is restricted and important regions with low-cg will be ignored in dna methylation profiling. this method could be improved to generate a more comprehensive representation.


RESULTS
based on in silico simulation of enzyme digestion of human and mouse genomes, we have optimized the current single-enzyme rrbs by applying double enzyme digestion in the library construction to interrogate more representative regions. cpg coverage of genomic regions was considerably increased in both high-cg and low-cg regions using the double-enzyme rrbs method, leading to more accurate detection of their average methylation levels and identification of differential methylation regions between samples. we also applied this double-enzyme rrbs method to comprehensively analyze the cpg methylation profiles of two colorectal cancer cell lines.


CONCLUSIONS
the double-enzyme rrbs increases the cpg coverage of genomic regions considerably over the previous single-enzyme rrbs method, leading to more accurate detection of their average methylation levels. it will facilitate genome-wide dna methylation studies in multiple and complex clinical samples.
