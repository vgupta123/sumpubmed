BACKGROUND
narciclasine  is an amaryllidaceae alkaloid isolated from narcissus tazetta bulbs. ncs has inhibitory effects on a broad range of biological activities and thus has various potential practical applications. here we examine how ncs represses plant root growth.


RESULTS
results showed that the inhibition of ncs on cell division in arabidopsis root tips and its effects on cell differentiation are concentration-dependent; at low concentrations  ncs preferentially targets mitotic cell cycle specific/cyclin complexes, whereas at high concentration  the ncs-stimulated accumulation of kip-related proteins  affects the cdk complexes with a role at both g1/s and g2/m phases.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that ncs modulates the coordination between cell division and differentiation in arabidopsis root tips and hence affects the postembryonic development of arabidopsis seedlings.
