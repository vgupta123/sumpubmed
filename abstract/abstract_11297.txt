BACKGROUND
xp <dig> and op <dig> are phages of xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae , the causative agent of bacterial leaf blight in rice plants, which were isolated in  <dig> in taiwan and in  <dig> in japan, respectively. we recently isolated the xoo phage xop <dig> 


RESULTS
the linear xop <dig> genome  sequenced here is  <dig> bp longer than that of xp <dig>  and  <dig> bp longer than that of op <dig> . the g+c contents of op <dig>  and xop <dig> and xp <dig>  are less than that of the host . the 9-bp 3'-overhangs  in xop <dig> and xp <dig> are absent from op <dig>  more of the deduced xop <dig> proteins share higher degrees of identity with xp <dig> than with op <dig> proteins, while the right end of the genomes of xp <dig> and op <dig>  containing all predicted promoters, share stronger homology. xop <dig>  xp <dig>  and op <dig> contain  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> freestanding hnh endonuclease genes, respectively. these genes can be classified into five groups depending on their possession of the hnh domain  and/or ap <dig> domain in intact or truncated forms. while the hnn-ap <dig> type endonuclease genes dispersed in the genome, the hnh type endonuclease genes, each with a unique copy, were located within the same genome context. mass spectrometry and n-terminal sequencing showed nine xop <dig> coat proteins, among which three were identified, six were assigned as coat proteins  and conserved phage proteins  in xp <dig>  the major coat protein, in which only the n-terminal methionine is removed, appears to exist in oligomeric forms containing  <dig> to  <dig> subunits. the three phages exhibit different patterns of domain duplication in the n-terminus of the tail fiber, which are involved in determination of the host range. many short repeated sequences are present in and around the duplicated domains.


CONCLUSIONS
geographical separation may have confined lateral gene transfer among the xoo phages. the hnn-ap <dig> type endonucleases were more likely to transfer their genes randomly in the genome and may degenerate after successful transmission. some repeated sequences may be involved in duplication/loss of the domains in the tail fiber genes.
