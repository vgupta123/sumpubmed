BACKGROUND
a-kinase anchoring proteins  are molecular scaffolding proteins mediating the assembly of multi-protein complexes containing camp-dependent protein kinase a , directing the kinase in discrete subcellular locations. splice variants from the akap <dig> gene  are vital components of neuronal and cardiac phosphatase complexes, ion channels, cardiac ca2+ handling and renal water transport.


RESULTS
shown in evolutionary analyses, the formation of the akap7-ri/rii binding domain  corresponds to vertebrate-specific gene duplication events in the pka-ri/rii subunits. species analyses of akap <dig> splice variants shows the ancestral akap <dig> splice variant is akap7α, while the ancestral long form akap <dig> splice variant is akap7γ. multi-species akap <dig> gene alignments, show the recent formation of akap7δ occurs with the loss of native akap7γ in rats and basal primates. akap <dig> gene alignments and two dimensional western analyses indicate that akap7γ is produced from an internal translation-start site that is present in the akap7δ cdna of mice and humans but absent in rats. immunofluorescence analysis of akap <dig> protein localization in both rat and mouse heart suggests akap7γ replaces akap7δ at the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum in species other than rat. dna sequencing identified human akap7δ insertion-deletions  that promote the production of akap7γ instead of akap7δ.


CONCLUSIONS
this akap <dig> molecular evolution study shows that these vital scaffolding proteins developed in ancestral vertebrates and that independent mutations in the akap <dig> genes of rodents and early primates has resulted in the recent formation of akap7δ, a splice variant of likely lesser importance in humans than currently described.
