BACKGROUND
in an acidic and lysine-rich environment escherichia coli induces expression of the cadba operon which encodes cada, the lysine decarboxylase, and cadb, the lysine/cadaverine antiporter. cadba expression is dependent on cadc, a membrane-integrated transcriptional activator which belongs to the toxr-like protein family. activation of cadc requires two stimuli, lysine and low ph. whereas lysine is detected by an interplay between cadc and the lysine-specific transporter lysp, ph alterations are sensed by cadc directly. crystal structural analyses revealed a close proximity between two periplasmic cysteines, cys <dig> and cys <dig> 


RESULTS
substitution of cys <dig> and/or cys <dig> by alanine resulted in cadc derivatives that were active in response to only one stimulus, either lysine or ph  <dig> . differential in vivo thiol trapping revealed a disulfide bond between these two residues at ph  <dig> , but not at ph  <dig> . when cys <dig> and cys <dig> were replaced by aspartate and lysine, respectively, virtually wild-type behavior was restored indicating that the disulfide bond could be mimicked by a salt bridge.


CONCLUSIONS
a disulfide bond was found in the periplasmic domain of cadc that supports an inactive state of cadc at ph  <dig> . at ph  <dig>  disulfide bond formation is prevented which transforms cadc into a semi-active state. these results provide new insights into the function of a ph sensor.
