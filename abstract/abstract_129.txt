BACKGROUND
insertions and deletions  are the most abundant form of structural variation in all genomes. indels have been increasingly recognized as an important source of molecular markers due to high-density occurrence, cost-effectiveness, and ease of genotyping. coupled with developments in bioinformatics, next-generation sequencing  platforms enable the discovery of millions of indel polymorphisms by comparing the whole genome sequences of individuals within a species.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> , <dig> unique indels were identified in  <dig> maize genomes, with an overall density of  <dig>  indels/mbp, and an average allele number of  <dig> , ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  there were  <dig>  indels with polymorphism information content  values greater than or equal to  <dig> , accounting for  <dig>  % of overall indels. of these highly polymorphic indels, we designed primer pairs for  <dig>  and  <dig>  indels with major allele differences  greater than or equal to  <dig> and 8 bp, respectively, based on the differing resolution capabilities of gel electrophoresis. the accuracy of our indel markers was experimentally validated, and among  <dig> indel markers, average accuracy was approximately 90 %. in addition, we also validated the polymorphism of the indel markers. of  <dig> highly polymorphic indel markers, all had polymorphisms with average pic values of  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
the maize genome is rich in indel polymorphisms. intriguingly, the level of polymorphism in genic regions of the maize genome was higher than that in intergenic regions. the polymorphic indel markers developed from this study may enhance the efficiency of genetic research and marker-assisted breeding in maize.
