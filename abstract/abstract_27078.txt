BACKGROUND
cattle populations are characterized by regular outburst of genetic defects as a result of the extensive use of elite sires. the causative genes and mutations can nowadays be rapidly identified by means of genome-wide association studies combined with next generation dna sequencing, provided that the causative mutations are conventional loss-of-function variants. we show in this work how the combined use of next generation dna and rna sequencing allows for the rapid identification of otherwise difficult to identify splice-site variants.


RESULTS
we report the use of haplotype-based association mapping to identify a locus on bovine chromosome  <dig> that underlies autosomal recessive arthrogryposis in belgian blue cattle. we identify  <dig> candidate mutations by resequencing the genome of four cases and  <dig> controls at ~10-fold depth. by analyzing rna-seq data from a carrier fetus, we observe skipping of the second exon of the pigh gene, which we confirm by rt-pcr to be fully penetrant in tissues from affected calves. we identify - amongst the  <dig> candidate variants - a c-to-g transversion in the first intron of the pigh gene  that is predicted to affect its acceptor splice-site. the resulting pigh protein is likely to be non-functional as it lacks essential domains, and hence to cause arthrogryposis.


CONCLUSIONS
this work illustrates how the growing arsenal of genome exploration tools continues to accelerate the identification of an even broader range of disease causing mutations, therefore improving the management and control of genetic defects in livestock.
