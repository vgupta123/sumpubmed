BACKGROUND

there is a large body of experimental evidence suggesting that omega- <dig>  polyunsaturated fatty acids  are capable of modulating immune function. some studies have shown that these pufas might have a beneficial effect in patients suffering form multiple sclerosis , a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system . this could be due to increased n- <dig> pufa-derived anti-inflammatory lipid mediators. in the present study we tested the effect of an endogenously increased n- <dig> pufa status on cuprizone-induced cns demyelination and remyelination in fat- <dig> mice versus their wild-type  littermates. fat- <dig> mice express an n- <dig> desaturase, which allows them to convert n- <dig> pufas into n- <dig> pufas.


RESULTS
cns lipid profiles in fat- <dig> mice showed a significant increase of eicosapentaenoic acid  levels but similar docosahexaenoic acid levels compared to wt littermates. this was also reflected in significantly higher levels of monohydroxy epa metabolites such as 18-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid  in fat- <dig> brain tissue. feeding fat- <dig> mice and wt littermates  <dig> % cuprizone for 5 weeks caused a similar degree of cns demyelination in both groups; remyelination was increased in the fat- <dig> group after a recovery period of 2 weeks. however, at p =  <dig>  this difference missed statistical significance.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that n- <dig> pufas might have a role in promotion of remyelination after toxic injury to cns oligodendrocytes. this might occur either via modulation of the immune system or via a direct effect on oligodendrocytes or neurons through epa-derived lipid metabolites such as 18-hepe.
