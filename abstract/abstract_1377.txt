BACKGROUND
the c2h <dig> zinc finger  domain is widely conserved among eukaryotic proteins. in zic/gli/zap <dig> c2h <dig> zf proteins, the two n-terminal zfs form a single structural unit by sharing a hydrophobic core. this structural unit defines a new motif comprised of two tryptophan side chains at the center of the hydrophobic core. because each tryptophan residue is located between the two cysteine residues of the c2h <dig> motif, we have named this structure the tandem cwch <dig>  motif.


RESULTS
here, we characterized  <dig> tcwch2-containing genes using data derived from public databases. we categorized genes into  <dig> classes including zic/gli/glis, arid2/rsc <dig>  pacc, mizf, aebp <dig>  zap1/zafa, fungl, zfp <dig>  twincl, clr <dig>  and fungl-4zf, based on sequence similarity, domain organization, and functional similarities. tcwch <dig> motifs are mostly found in organisms belonging to the opisthokonta  and amoebozoa . by comparison, the c2h <dig> zf motif is distributed widely among the eukaryotes. the structure and organization of the tcwch <dig> motif, its phylogenetic distribution, and molecular phylogenetic analysis suggest that prototypical tcwch <dig> genes existed in the opisthokonta ancestor. within-group or between-group comparisons of the tcwch <dig> amino acid sequence identified three additional sequence features .


CONCLUSIONS
these features suggest that the tcwch <dig> motif is a specialized motif involved in inter-zinc finger interactions.
