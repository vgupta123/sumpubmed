BACKGROUND
feeding alfalfa hay is often recommended for its buffering components, like protein and calcium, to prevent lesions of the gastric mucosa in horses. until now, there has been no information regarding the influence of alfalfa particle size on the gastric mucosa. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of feeding two alfalfa preparations with different particle sizes  in comparison with grass hay on the gastric mucosa in weanling horses. we hypothesized that feeding a high proportion of fine alfalfa particles would negatively impact gastric mucosa and that feeding long alfalfa chaff would improve gastric mucosal health in weanlings.


RESULTS
before weaning, the prevalence of gastric mucosa lesions  was  <dig>  %; at 14 days after weaning, it was almost 100 %. before and after weaning, most of the lesions were found at the greater curvature of the squamous mucosa and at the lesser curvature. after weaning, gastric mucosal lesions at the pylorus were significantly more severe in the group fed alfalfa chaff . in the other regions, no differences related to the feeding regimes were observed.


CONCLUSIONS
feeding alfalfa failed to improve gastric mucosal lesion scores in weanlings. furthermore, foals fed alfalfa chaff had higher lesion scores at the pylorus. alfalfa leaves contain a superior protein source and high amounts of calcium and magnesium, providing extra nutritional advantages in growing horses. at this time, either traditional grass hay rations or grass hay with alfalfa pellets can be recommended.
