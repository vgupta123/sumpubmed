BACKGROUND
within the framework of a genomics project on livestock species , we initiated a high-throughput dna sequencing program of expressed sequence tags  in rainbow trout, oncorhynchus mykiss.


RESULTS
we constructed three cdna libraries including one highly complex pooled-tissue library. these libraries were normalized and subtracted to reduce clone redundancy. ests sequences were produced, and  <dig>  <dig> ests corresponding to high quality sequence reads were released on the international database, currently representing  <dig> % of the overall sequence knowledge in this species. all these est sequences and other publicly available ests in rainbow trout have been included on a publicly available website  and have been clustered into a total of  <dig>  <dig> clusters of putative transcripts groups, including  <dig>  <dig> singletons.  <dig> % of these  <dig>  <dig> clusters are represented by at least one agenae est and  <dig>  <dig> clusters  are only composed by agenae ests. sequence analysis also reveals that normalization and especially subtraction were effective in decreasing redundancy, and that the pooled-tissue library was representative of the initial tissue complexity.


CONCLUSIONS
due to present work on the construction of rainbow trout normalized cdna libraries and their extensive sequencing, along with other large scale sequencing programs, rainbow trout is now one of the major fish models in term of est sequences available in a public database, just after zebrafish, danio rerio. this information is now used for the selection of a non redundant set of clones for producing dna micro-arrays in order to examine global gene expression.
