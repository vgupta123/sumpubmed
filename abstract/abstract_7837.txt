BACKGROUND
diacylglycerol acyltransferase  catalyzes the acyl-coa-dependent acylation of sn- <dig>  2-diacylglycerol to generate triacylglycerol and coa. the deduced amino acid sequence of cdnas encoding dgat <dig> from plants and mammals exhibit a hydrophilic n-terminal region followed by a number of potential membrane-spanning segments, which is consistent with the membrane-bound nature of this enzyme family. in order to gain insight into the structure/function properties of dgat <dig> from brassica napus , we produced and partially characterized a recombinant polyhis-tagged n-terminal fragment of the enzyme, bndgat1his <dig>  with calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  da.


RESULTS
bndgat1his <dig> was highly purified from bacterial lysate and plate-like monoclinic crystals were grown using this preparation. lipidex- <dig> binding assays and gel electrophoresis indicated that bndgat1his <dig> interacts with long chain acyl-coa. the enzyme fragment displayed enhanced affinity for erucoyl -coa over oleoyl -coa, and the binding process displayed positive cooperativity. gel filtration chromatography and cross-linking studies indicated that bndgat1his <dig> self-associated to form a tetramer. polyclonal antibodies raised against a peptide of  <dig> amino acid residues representing a segment of bndgat1his <dig> failed to react with protein in microsomal vesicles following treatment with proteinase k, suggesting that the n-terminal fragment of bndgat <dig> was localized to the cytosolic side of the er.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, these results suggest that bndgat <dig> may be allosterically modulated by acyl-coa through the n-terminal region and that the enzyme self-associates via interactions on the cytosolic side of the er.
