BACKGROUND
the delivery of ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome for degradation is a key step in the regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, yet the mechanisms underlying this step are not understood in detail. the rad <dig> family of proteins is known to bind ubiquitinated proteins through its two ubiquitin-associated  domains, and may participate in the delivery of ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome through docking via the rad <dig> ubiquitin-like  domain.


RESULTS
in this study, we investigate how the interaction between the ubl and uba domains may modulate ubiquitin recognition and the delivery of ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome by autoinhibition. we have explored a competitive binding model using specific mutations in the ubl domain. disrupting the intramolecular ubl-uba domain interactions in hhr23a indeed potentiates ubiquitin-binding. additionally, the analogous surface on the rad <dig> ubl domain overlaps with that required for interaction with both proteasomes and the ubiquitin ligase ufd <dig>  we have found that mutation of residues on this surface affects the ability of rad <dig> to deliver ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the competition of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway components for surfaces on rad <dig> is important for the role of the rad <dig> family proteins in proteasomal targeting.
