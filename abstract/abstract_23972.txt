BACKGROUND
aglepristone  is an antiprogestin used for pregnancy termination, parturition induction and conservative pyometra treatment in bitches. its molecular structure is similar to mifepristone, an antiprogestin used in human medicine. mifepristone has been shown to suppress proliferation and cytokine production by t cells, whereas the effect of aglepristone on t cell function remains elusive. the purpose of this project was to investigate the in vitro influence of ru <dig> on ifn-γ and il- <dig> synthesis by peripheral blood t cells isolated from healthy bitches  in luteal phase. the peripheral blood mononuclear cells  were incubated with three different dosages of aglepristone, or dimethyl sulfoxide , with or without mitogen. the production of cytokines by resting or mitogen-activated t cells was determined by intercellular staining and flow cytometry analysis or elisa assay, respectively.


RESULTS
our results showed no statistically significant differences in the percentage of ifn-γ and il-4-synthesizing cd4+ or cd8+ resting t cells between untreated and aglepristone-treated cells at  <dig> and  <dig> hours post treatment. moreover, mitogen-activated pbmcs treated with ru <dig> displayed similar concentration of ifn-γ and il- <dig> in culture supernatants to those observed in mitogen-activated dmso-treated pbmcs. presented results indicate that administration of aglepristone for  <dig> hours has no influence on ifn-γ and il- <dig> synthesis by resting and mitogen-activated t cells isolated from diestral bitches.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that antiprogestins may differentially affect t cell function depending on the animal species in which they are applied.
