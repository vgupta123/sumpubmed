BACKGROUND
the large amount of available sequence information for the plant acyl-acp thioesterases  made it possible to use a bioinformatics-guided approach to identify amino acid residues involved in substrate specificity. the conserved property difference locator  program allowed the identification of putative specificity-determining residues that differ between the fata and fatb te classes. six of the fata residue differences identified by cpdl were incorporated into the fatb-like parent via site-directed mutagenesis and the effect of each on te activity was determined. variants were expressed in e. coli strain k <dig> that allows determination of enzyme activity by gcms analysis of fatty acids released into the medium.


RESULTS
substitutions at four of the positions  changed substrate specificity to varying degrees while changes at the remaining two positions,  <dig> and  <dig>  essentially inactivated the thioesterase. the effects of substitutions at positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  or  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  were not additive with respect to specificity.


CONCLUSIONS
four of six putative specificity determining positions in plant tes, identified with the use of cpdl, were validated experimentally; a novel colorimetric screen that discriminates between active and inactive tes is also presented.
