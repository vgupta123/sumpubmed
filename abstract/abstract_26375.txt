BACKGROUND
the subfamily stevardiinae is a diverse and widely distributed clade of freshwater fishes from south and central america, commonly known as “tetras” . the group was named “clade a” when first proposed as a monophyletic unit of characidae and later designated as a subfamily. stevardiinae includes  <dig> genera and around  <dig> valid species with many species presenting inseminating reproductive strategy. no global hypothesis of relationships is available for this group and currently many genera are listed as incertae sedis or are suspected to be non-monophyletic.


RESULTS
we present a molecular phylogeny with the largest number of stevardiine species analyzed so far, including  <dig> samples representing  <dig> putative species distributed in  <dig> genera, to test the group’s monophyly and internal relationships. the phylogeny was inferred using dna sequence data from seven gene fragments . the results support the stevardiinae as a monophyletic group and a detailed hypothesis of the internal relationships for this subfamily.


CONCLUSIONS
a revised classification based on the molecular phylogeny is proposed that includes seven tribes and also defines monophyletic genera, including a resurrected genus eretmobrycon, and new definitions for diapoma, hemibrycon, bryconamericus sensu stricto, and knodus sensu stricto, placing some small genera as junior synonyms. inseminating species are distributed in several clades suggesting that reproductive strategy is evolutionarily labile in this group of fishes.
