BACKGROUND
new technologies have enabled genome-wide association studies to be conducted with hundreds of thousands of genotyped snps. several different first-generation genome-wide panels of snps have been commercialized. the total amount of common genetic variation is still unknown; however, the coverage of commercial panels can be evaluated against reference population samples genotyped by the international hapmap project. less information is available about coverage in samples from other populations.


RESULTS
in this study we compare four commercial panels: the humanhap  <dig> and humanhap  <dig> array sets from the illumina infinium series and the mapping  <dig> k and mapping  <dig> k array sets from the affymetrix genechip series. tagging performance is compared among hapmap ceph , asian  and yoruba  population samples. it is also evaluated in an estonian population sample with more than  <dig> individuals genotyped in two 500-kbp encode regions of chromosome 2: enr <dig> on 2p <dig>  and enr <dig> on 2p <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
we found that in a non-reference caucasian population, commercial snp panels provide levels of coverage similar to those in the hapmap ceph population sample. we present the proportions of universal and population-specific snps in all the commercial platforms studied.
