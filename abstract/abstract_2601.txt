BACKGROUND
the sequencing of the d.melanogaster genome revealed an unexpected small number of genes  indicating that mechanisms acting on generation of transcript diversity must have played a major role in the evolution of complex metazoans. among the most extensively used mechanisms that accounts for this diversity is alternative splicing. it is estimated that over 40% of drosophila protein-coding genes contain one or more alternative exons. a recent transcription map of the drosophila embryogenesis indicates that 30% of the transcribed regions are unannotated, and that 1/ <dig> of this is estimated as missed or alternative exons of previously characterized protein-coding genes. therefore, the identification of the variety of expressed transcripts depends on experimental data for its final validation and is continuously being performed using different approaches. we applied the open reading frame expressed sequence tags  methodology, which is capable of generating cdna data from the central portion of rare transcripts, in order to investigate the presence of hitherto unnanotated regions of drosophila transcriptome.


RESULTS
bioinformatic analysis of  <dig>  drosophila orestes clusters identified  <dig> sequences derived from unannotated regions in the current drosophila genome version . of these, a set of  <dig> was analysed by polya+ northern blot hybridization, validating  <dig>  new exons of low abundance transcripts. for one of these ests, we obtained the cdna encompassing the complete coding sequence of a new serine protease, named sp <dig>  the sp <dig> gene is part of a serine protease gene cluster located in the chromosome region 88a12-b <dig>  this cluster includes the predicted genes cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig>  which were previously identified as up-regulated after immune challenges in genomic-scale microarray analysis. in agreement with the proposal that this locus is co-regulated in response to microorganisms infection, we show here that sp <dig> is also up-regulated upon injury.


CONCLUSIONS
using the orestes methodology we identified  <dig> novel exons from low abundance drosophila transcripts, and through a pcr approach the complete cds of one of these transcripts was defined. our results show that the computational identification and manual inspection are not sufficient to annotate a genome in the absence of experimentally derived data.
