BACKGROUND
as a typical geocarpic plant, peanut embryogenesis and pod development are complex processes involving many gene regulatory pathways and controlled by appropriate hormone level. micrornas  are small non-coding rnas that play indispensable roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation. recently, identification and characterization of peanut mirnas has been described. however, whether mirnas participate in the regulation of peanut embryogenesis and pod development has yet to be explored.


RESULTS
in this study, small rna and degradome libraries from peanut early pod of different developmental stages were constructed and sequenced. a total of  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirna families were discovered. among them,  <dig> mirna families were legume-specific and  <dig> families were peanut-specific.  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirna families were differentially expressed during pod development. in addition,  <dig> target genes were identified for  <dig> mirna families by degradome sequencing. several new targets that might be specific to peanut were found and further validated by rna ligase-mediated rapid amplification of 5′ cdna ends . furthermore, we performed profiling analysis of intact and total transcripts of several target genes, demonstrating that spl , nac , pprp , ap <dig>  and grf  are actively modulated during early pod development, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
large numbers of mirnas and their related target genes were identified through deep sequencing. these findings provided new information on mirna-mediated regulatory pathways in peanut pod, which will contribute to the comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms that governing peanut embryo and early pod development.
