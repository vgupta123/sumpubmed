BACKGROUND
phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles  mediated by kinases and phosphatases are common in cellular signalling. kinetic modelling of pdcs has shown that these systems can exhibit a variety of input-output  behaviors including graded response, ultrasensitivity and bistability. in addition to proteins, there are a class of lipids known as phosphoinositides  that can be phosphorylated. experimental studies have revealed the formation of an antagonistic kinase-phosphatase complex in regulation of phosphorylation of pis. however, the functional significance of this type of complex formation is not clear.


RESULTS
we first revisit the basic pdc and show that partial asymptotic phosphorylation of substrate limits ultrasensitivity. also, substrate levels are changed one can obtain non-monotonic bell-shaped dose-response curves over a narrow range of parameters. then we extend the pdc to include kinase-phosphatase complex formation. we report the possibility of robust bell-shaped dose-response for a specific class of the model with complex formation. also, we show that complex formation can produce ultrasensitivity outside the goldbeter-koshland zero-order ultrasensitivity regime through a mechanism similar to competitive inhibition between an enzyme and its inhibitor.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the novel pdc module studied here exhibits new dose-response behaviour. in particular, we show that the bell-shaped response could result in transient phosphorylation of substrate. we discuss the relevance of this result in the context of experimental observations on pi regulation in endosomal trafficking.
