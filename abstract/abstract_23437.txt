BACKGROUND
porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide  is a crucial virulence factor strongly associated with chronic periodontitis which is the primary cause of tooth loss in adults. it exhibits remarkable heterogeneity containing tetra- and penta- acylated lipid a structures. human gingival fibroblasts  as the main resident cells of human gingiva play a key role in regulating matrix metalloproteinases  and contribute to periodontal homeostasis. this study investigated the expression and regulation of mmps1- <dig> and tissue inhibitors of mmp- <dig>  in hgfs in response to p. gingivalis lps1435/ <dig> and lps <dig> and hexa-acylated e. coli lps as a reference. the expression of mmps 1– <dig> and timp- <dig> was evaluated by real-time pcr and elisa.


RESULTS
the mmp- <dig> mrna and protein were highly upregulated in p. gingivalis lps1690- and e. coli lps-treated cells, whereas no induction was observed in p. gingivalis lps1435/1449-treated cells. on the contrary, the expression of mmp- <dig> and − <dig> was not significantly affected by p. gingivalis lps lipid a heterogeneity. the timp- <dig> mrna was upregulated in p. gingivalis lps1435/1449- and e. coli lps-treated cells. next, signal transduction pathways involved in p. gingivalis lps-induced expression of mmp- <dig> were examined by blocking assays. blockage of p <dig> mapk and erk significantly inhibited p. gingivalis lps1690-induced mmp- <dig> expression in hgfs.


CONCLUSIONS
the present findings suggest that the heterogeneous lipid a structures of p. gingivalis lps differentially modulate the expression of mmp- <dig> in hgfs, which may play a role in periodontal pathogenesis.
