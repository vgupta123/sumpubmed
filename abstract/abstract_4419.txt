BACKGROUND
resistance to the blackleg disease of brassica napus , caused by the hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen leptosphaeria maculans, is determined by both race-specific resistance  genes and quantitative resistance loci , or adult-plant resistance . while the introgression of r genes into breeding material is relatively simple, qtl are often detected sporadically, making them harder to capture in breeding programs. for the effective deployment of apr in crop varieties, resistance qtl need to have a reliable influence on phenotype in multiple environments and be well defined genetically to enable marker-assisted selection .


RESULTS
doubled-haploid populations produced from the susceptible b. napus variety topas and apr varieties ag-castle and av-sapphire were analysed for resistance to blackleg in two locations over  <dig> and 4 years, respectively. three stable qtl were detected in each population, with two loci appearing to be common to both apr varieties. physical delineation of three qtl regions was sufficient to identify candidate defense-related genes, including a cluster of cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases contained within a  <dig> gene qtl interval on chromosome a <dig>  individual l. maculans isolates were used to define the physical intervals for the race-specific r genes rlm <dig> and rlm <dig> and to identify qtl common to both field studies and the cotyledon resistance response.


CONCLUSIONS
through multi-environment qtl analysis we have identified and delineated four significant and stable qtl suitable for mas of quantitative blackleg resistance in b. napus, and identified candidate genes which potentially play a role in quantitative defense responses to l. maculans.
