BACKGROUND
expansins are plant cell wall loosening proteins encoded by a large superfamily of genes, consisting of four families named expa, expb, exla, and exlb. the evolution of the expansin superfamily is well understood in angiosperms, thanks to synteny-based evolutionary studies of the gene superfamily in arabidopsis, rice, and populus. analysis of the expansin superfamily in the moss physcomitrella patens revealed a superfamily without exla or exlb genes that has evolved considerably and independently of angiosperm expansins. the sequencing of the selaginella moellendorffii genome has allowed us to extend these analyses into an early diverging vascular plant.


RESULTS
the expansin superfamily in selaginella moellendorffii has now been assembled from genomic scaffolds. a smaller  superfamily is revealed, consistent with studies of other gene families in selaginella. selaginella has an expansin superfamily, which, like physcomitrella, lacks exla or exlb genes, but does contain two expa genes that are related to a particular arabidopsis-rice clade involved in root hair development.


CONCLUSIONS
from sequence-based phylogenetic analysis, most selaginella expansins lie outside the arabidopsis-rice clades, leading us to estimate the minimum number of expansins present in the last common ancestor of selaginella and angiosperms at  <dig> expa genes and  <dig> expb gene. these results confirm selaginella as an important intermediary between bryophytes and angiosperms.
