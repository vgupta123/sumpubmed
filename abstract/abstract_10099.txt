BACKGROUND
endogenous small interfering rnas repress mrna levels and retrotransposon mobility in drosophila somatic cells by poorly understood mechanisms.  <dig> nucleotide esirnas are primarily generated from retrotransposons and two inverted repeat  loci in drosophila culture cells in a dicer <dig> dependent manner. additionally, proteins involved in 3’ end processing, such as symplekin, cpsf <dig> and cpsr <dig>  have been recently implicated in the esirna pathway.


RESULTS
here we present evidence of overlap between two essential rna metabolic pathways: esirna biogenesis and mrna 3' end processing. we have identified a nucleus-specific interaction between the essential esirna cleavage enzyme dicer <dig>  and symplekin, a component of the core cleavage complex  required for 3' end processing of all eukaryotic mrnas. this interaction is mediated by the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of symplekin; ccc factors cpsf <dig> and cpsf <dig> do not contact dcr <dig>  while dcr <dig> binds the ccc, dcr <dig> knockdown does not affect mrna 3' end formation. rnai-depletion of ccc components symplekin and cpsf <dig> causes perturbations in esirna abundance that correlate with fluctuations in retrotransposon and hairpin esirna precursor levels. we also discovered that esirnas generated from retrotransposons and hairpins have distinct physical characteristics including a higher predominance of  <dig> nucleotide hairpin-derived esirnas and differences in 3' and 5' base preference. additionally, retrotransposon precursors and derived esirnas are highly enriched in the nucleus while hairpins and hairpin derived esirnas are predominantly cytoplasmic similar to canonical mrnas. rnai-depletion of either cpsf <dig> or symplekin results in nuclear retention of both hairpin and retrotransposon precursors suggesting that polyadenylation indirectly affects cellular localization of dcr <dig> substrates.


CONCLUSIONS
together, these observations support a novel mechanism in which differences in localization of esirna precursors impacts esirna biogenesis. hairpin-derived esirnas are generated in the cytoplasm independent of dcr2-symplekin interactions, while retrotransposons are processed in the nucleus.
