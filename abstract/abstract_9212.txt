BACKGROUND
the amino acid derivative  <dig> -dihydroxy l-phenylalanine  is gaining interest as a drug of choice for parkinson's disease. aspergillus oryzae is commonly used for l-dopa production; however, a slower growth rate and relatively lower tyrosinase activity of mycelia have led to an increasing interest in exploiting alternative fungal cultures. in the present investigation, we report on the microbiological transformation of l-tyrosine to l-dopa accomplished by a newly isolated filamentous fungus aspergillus niger.


RESULTS
the culture a. niger  was propagated in  <dig> ml erlenmeyer flasks and the pre-grown mycelia  were used in the reaction mixture as a source of enzyme tyrosinase. grinded mycelia gave  <dig>  fold higher l-dopa production compared to the intact at 6% glucose . the rate of l-tyrosine consumption was improved from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/ml. among the various nitrogen sources,  <dig> % peptone, 1% yeast extract and  <dig> % ammonium chloride were optimized. the maximal l-dopa was produced  at  <dig> % potassium dihydrogen phosphate with l-tyrosine consumption of  <dig>  mg/ml.


CONCLUSIONS
over ~73% yield was achieved  when the process parameters were identified using 2k-plackett-burman experimental design. the results are highly significant  and mark the commercial utility  of the mould culture which is perhaps the first ever report on l-dopa production from a. niger.
