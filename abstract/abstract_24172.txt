BACKGROUND
many critical biological processes are strongly related to protein-rna interactions. revealing the protein structure motifs for rna-binding will provide valuable information for deciphering protein-rna recognition mechanisms and benefit complementary structural design in bioengineering. rna-binding events often take place at pockets on protein surfaces. the structural classification of local binding pockets determines the major patterns of rna recognition.


RESULTS
in this work, we provide a novel framework for systematically identifying the structure motifs of protein-rna binding sites in the form of pockets on regional protein surfaces via a structure alignment-based method. we first construct a similarity network of rna-binding pockets based on a non-sequential-order structure alignment method for local structure alignment. by using network community decomposition, the rna-binding pockets on protein surfaces are clustered into groups with structural similarity. with a multiple structure alignment strategy, the consensus rna-binding pockets in each group are identified. the crucial recognition patterns, as well as the protein-rna binding motifs, are then identified and analyzed.


CONCLUSIONS
large-scale rna-binding pockets on protein surfaces are grouped by measuring their structural similarities. this similarity network-based framework provides a convenient method for modeling the structural relationships of functional pockets. the local structural patterns identified serve as structure motifs for the recognition with rna on protein surfaces.
