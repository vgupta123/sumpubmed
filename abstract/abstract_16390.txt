BACKGROUND
wnt signaling affects fundamental development pathways by regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. aberrant activation of wnt/β-catenin signaling promotes the development of several cancers and is an attractive target for chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents.


RESULTS
in order to identify the novel antagonists for the wnt/β-catenin pathway, we employed a cell-based wnt reporter system  to screen a library of  <dig> known drugs. we identified spiperone, a psychotropic drug, as a novel wnt inhibitor, which specifically blocks canonical wnt signaling prior to the activation of β-catenin. the wnt inhibitory function of spiperone is not associated with its dopamine-, serotonin- and sigma-receptor antagonist properties. instead, spiperone increases intracellular calcium levels in a similar manner to thapsigargin, that also impedes wnt signal transduction. inhibition of protein kinase c had no effect on spiperone-mediated antagonism of wnt signaling.


CONCLUSIONS
spiperone is a calcium regulator. it inhibits wnt signaling by enhancing intracellular calcium levels.
