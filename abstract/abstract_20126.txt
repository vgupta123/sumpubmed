BACKGROUND
in the last years, applications based on massively parallelized rna sequencing  have become valuable approaches for studying non-model species, e.g., without a fully sequenced genome. rna-seq is a useful tool for detecting novel transcripts and genetic variations and for evaluating differential gene expression by digital measurements. the large and complex datasets resulting from functional genomic experiments represent a challenge in data processing, management, and analysis. this problem is especially significant for small research groups working with non-model species.


RESULTS
we developed a web-based application, called atgc transcriptomics, with a flexible and adaptable interface that allows users to work with new generation sequencing  transcriptomic analysis results using an ontology-driven database. this new application simplifies data exploration, visualization, and integration for a better comprehension of the results.


CONCLUSIONS
atgc transcriptomics provides access to non-expert computer users and small research groups to a scalable storage option and simple data integration, including database administration and management. the software is freely available under the terms of gnu public license at http://atgcinta.sourceforge.net.
