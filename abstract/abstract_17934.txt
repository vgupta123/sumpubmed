BACKGROUND
retrospective studies can complement information derived from double-blinded randomized trials. there are multiple retrospective studies reporting good efficacy and tolerability of the anti-epileptic drug levetiracetam  in human patients with epilepsy; however, reports of lev's tolerability and efficacy in dogs with epilepsy remain limited. the purpose of this retrospective study was to describe the use of lev in a canine epilepsy clinic and determine the long-term efficacy and tolerability of lev in veterinary clinical practice. the electronic database of a uk based referral hospital was searched for lev usage in dogs with seizures. information and data necessary for the evaluation were obtained from a combination of electronic and written hospital records, the referring veterinary surgeons’ records and telephone interviews with dog owners. only dogs that were reportedly diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy were included in the study.


RESULTS
fifty-two dogs were included in this retrospective study. two treatment protocols were recognised;  <dig> dogs were treated continuously with lev and  <dig> dogs received interval or pulse treatment for cluster seizures. lev treatment resulted in 69% of dogs having a 50% or greater reduction of seizure frequency whilst 15% of all the dogs were completely free from seizures. seizure frequency reduced significantly in the whole population. no dog was reported to experience life-threatening side effects. mild side effects were experienced by 46% of dogs and a significantly higher number of these dogs were in the pulse treatment group. the most common side-effects reported were sedation and ataxia.


CONCLUSIONS
lev appears to be effective and well tolerated for reduction of seizures.
