BACKGROUND
kernel weight, controlled by quantitative trait loci , is an important component of grain yield in maize. cytokinins  participate in determining grain morphology and final grain yield in crops. zmipt <dig>  which is expressed mainly in the basal transfer cell layer, endosperm, and embryo during maize kernel development, encodes an isopentenyl transferase  that is involved in ck biosynthesis.


RESULTS
the coding region of zmipt <dig> was sequenced across a panel of  <dig> maize inbred lines that are currently used in chinese maize breeding programs. only  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  and seven haplotypes were detected among these inbred lines. nucleotide diversity  within the zmipt <dig> window and coding region were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, and they were significantly lower than the mean nucleotide diversity value of  <dig>  for maize chromosome  <dig> . association mapping revealed that a single nucleotide change from cytosine  to thymine  in the zmipt <dig> coding region, which converted a proline residue into a serine residue, was significantly associated with hundred kernel weight  in three environments , and explained  <dig> % of the total phenotypic variation. in vitro characterization suggests that the dimethylallyl diphospate  ipt activity of zmipt2-t is higher than that of zmipt2-c, as the amounts of adenosine triphosphate , adenosine diphosphate , and adenosine monophosphate  consumed by zmipt2-t were  <dig> -,  <dig> -, and  <dig> -fold, respectively, greater than those consumed by zmipt2-c. the effects of artificial selection on the zmipt <dig> coding region were evaluated using tajimaâ€™s d tests across six subgroups of chinese maize germplasm, with the most frequent favorable allele identified in subgroup pb .


CONCLUSIONS
these results showed that zmipt <dig>  which is associated with kernel weight, was subjected to artificial selection during the maize breeding process. zmipt2-t had higher ipt activity than zmipt2-c, and this favorable allele for kernel weight could be used in molecular marker-assisted selection for improvement of grain yield components in chinese maize breeding programs.
