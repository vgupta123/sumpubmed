BACKGROUND
gabaergic inhibition and effects of intracellular chloride ions on calcium channel activity have been proposed to regulate neurotransmission from photoreceptors. to assess the impact of these and other chloride-dependent mechanisms on release from cones, the chloride equilibrium potential  was determined in red-sensitive, large single cones from the tiger salamander retinal slice.


RESULTS
whole cell recordings were done using gramicidin perforated patch techniques to maintain endogenous cl- levels. membrane potentials were corrected for liquid junction potentials. cone resting potentials were found to average - <dig> mv. to measure ecl, we applied long depolarizing steps to activate the calcium-activated chloride current ) and then determined the reversal potential for the current component that was inhibited by the cl- channel blocker, niflumic acid. with this method, ecl was found to average - <dig> mv. in a complementary approach, we used a cl-sensitive dye, meq, to measure the cl- flux produced by depolarization with elevated concentrations of k+. the membrane potentials produced by the various high k+ solutions were measured in separate current clamp experiments. consistent with electrophysiological experiments, meq fluorescence measurements indicated that ecl was below - <dig> mv.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study indicate that ecl is close to the dark resting potential. this will minimize the impact of chloride-dependent presynaptic mechanisms in cone terminals involving gabaa receptors, glutamate transporters and icl.
