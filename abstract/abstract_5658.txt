BACKGROUND
secreted phosphoprotein  <dig>  is a multifunctional matricellular glycoprotein involved in development and regeneration of skeletal muscle. previously, we have demonstrated that porcine spp <dig> shows breed-related differential mrna expression during myogenesis. with the aim to identify putative contributing cis-regulatory dna variation we resequenced the 5' upstream region of the gene in the respective breeds pietrain and duroc. we found two single nucleotide polymorphisms . we focused our investigation on the snp g.3836a>g, because in silico analysis and knowledge about the regulation of spp <dig> suggested an effect of this snp on a ccaat/enhancer binding protein beta  responsive transcriptional enhancer.


RESULTS
using electrophoretic mobility shift assay we demonstrated that, similar to human spp <dig>  the 3' terminal end of the first intron of porcine spp <dig> harbors a c/ebpβ binding site and showed that this binding site is negatively affected by the mutant g allele. genotyping of  <dig> fetuses per breed revealed that the g allele segregated exclusively in duroc fetuses with a frequency of  <dig> percent. using real-time quantitative pcr we showed that, consistent with its negative effect on a transcriptional enhancer element, the g allele tends to decrease mrna abundance of spp <dig> in the fetal musculus longissimus dorsi .

moreover, we showed that the snp g.3836a>g leads to ubiquitous aberrant splicing of the first intron by generating a de novo and activating a cryptic splice acceptor site. aberrantly spliced transcripts comprise about half of the spp <dig> messages expressed by the g allele. both aberrant splice variants differ from the native transcript by insertions in the leader sequences which do not change the reading frame of spp <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
at the 3' terminal end of the first intron of the porcine spp <dig> we identified a unique, dually functional snp g.3836a>g. this snp affects the function of the spp <dig> gene at the dna level by affecting a c/ebpβ binding site and at the rna level by activating aberrant splicing of the first intron, and thus represents an interesting dna-marker to study phenotypic effects of spp <dig> dna-variation.
