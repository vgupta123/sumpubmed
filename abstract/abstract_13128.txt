BACKGROUND
micrornas  are recently discovered small non-coding rnas that play pivotal roles in gene expression, specifically at the post-transcriptional level in plants and animals. identification of mirnas in large number of diverse plant species is important to understand the evolution of mirnas and mirna-targeted gene regulations. now-a-days, publicly available databases play a central role in the in-silico biology. because, at least ~ <dig> mirna families are conserved in higher plants, a homology based search using these databases can help identify orthologs or paralogs in plants.


RESULTS
we searched all publicly available nucleotide databases of genome survey sequences , high-throughput genomics sequences , expressed sequenced tags  and nonredundant  nucleotides and identified  <dig> mirnas in  <dig> diverse plant species. we found more than  <dig> conserved mirna families in  <dig> plant species,  <dig> to <dig> families in  <dig> plant species and  <dig> to  <dig> families in  <dig> plant species. nineteen conserved mirna families were identified in important model legumes such as medicago, lotus and soybean. five mirna families – mir <dig>  mir156/ <dig>  mir <dig>  mir165/ <dig> and mir <dig> – were found in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> diverse plant species, respectively. mir <dig> homologs were found in  <dig> dicots, whereas mir <dig> and mir <dig> homologs, as well as the mir396d/e variant of the mir <dig> family, were found only in monocots, thus providing large-scale authenticity for the dicot- and monocot-specific mirnas. furthermore, we provide computational and/or experimental evidence for the conservation of  <dig> newly found arabidopsis mirna homologs  and  <dig> small rnas  in brassica spp.


CONCLUSIONS
using all publicly available nucleotide databases,  <dig> mirnas were identified in  <dig> diverse plant species. by combining the expression analysis with the computational approach, we found that  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> small rnas that have been identified only in arabidopsis thus far, are also conserved in brassica spp. these findings will be useful for tracing the evolution of small rnas by examining their expression in common ancestors of the arabidopsis-brassica lineage.
