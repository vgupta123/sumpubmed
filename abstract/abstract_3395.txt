BACKGROUND
wound healing in horses is fraught with complications. specifically, wounds on horse limbs often develop exuberant granulation tissue which behaves clinically like a benign tumor and resembles the human keloid in that the evolving scar is trapped in the proliferative phase of repair, leading to fibrosis. clues gained from the study of over-scarring in horses should eventually lead to new insights into how to prevent unwanted scar formation in humans. cdna fragments corresponding to ctnnb <dig>  and pecam <dig>  genes potentially contributing to the proliferative phase of repair, were previously identified in a mrna expression study as being up-regulated in  <dig> day wound biopsies from horses. the aim of the present study was to clone full-length equine ctnnb <dig> and pecam <dig> cdnas and to study the spatio-temporal expression of mrnas and corresponding proteins during repair of body and limb wounds in a horse model.


RESULTS
the temporal pattern of the two genes was similar; except for ctnnb <dig> in limb wounds, wounding caused up-regulation of mrna which did not return to baseline by the end of the study. relative over-expression of both ctnnb <dig> and pecam <dig> mrna was noted in body wounds compared to limb wounds. immunostaining for both β-catenin and pecam <dig> was principally observed in endothelial cells and fibroblasts and was especially pronounced in wounds having developed exuberant granulation tissue.


CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first to characterize equine cdna for ctnnb <dig> and pecam <dig> and to document that these genes are expressed during wound repair in horses. it appears that β-catenin may be regulated in a post-transcriptional manner while pecam <dig> might help thoracic wounds mount an efficient inflammatory response in contrast to what is observed in limb wounds. furthermore, data from this study suggest that β-catenin and pecam <dig> might interact to modulate endothelial cell and fibroblast proliferation during wound repair in the horse.
