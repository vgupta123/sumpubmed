BACKGROUND
the carbapenem subclass of β-lactams is among the most potent antibiotics available today. emerging evidence shows that, unlike other subclasses of β-lactams, carbapenems bind to and inhibit non-classical transpeptidases  that generate  <dig> →  <dig> linkages in bacterial peptidoglycan. the carbapenems biapenem and tebipenem exhibit therapeutically valuable potencies against mycobacterium tuberculosis .


RESULTS
here, we report the x-ray crystal structures of mtb
l,d-transpeptidase- <dig>  complexed with biapenem or tebipenem. despite significant variations in carbapenem sulfur side chains, biapenem and tebipenem ultimately form an identical adduct that docks to the outer cavity of ldtmt <dig>  we propose that this common adduct is an enzyme catalyzed decomposition of the carbapenem adduct by a mechanism similar to s-conjugate elimination by β-lyases.


CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here demonstrate biapenem and tebipenem bind to the outer cavity of ldtmt <dig>  covalently inactivate the enzyme, and subsequently degrade via an s-conjugate elimination mechanism. we discuss structure based drug design based on the findings and propose that the s-conjugate elimination can be leveraged to design novel agents to deliver and locally release antimicrobial factors to act synergistically with the carbapenem carrier.
