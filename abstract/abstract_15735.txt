BACKGROUND
overexpression and abnormal accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein  have been linked to parkinson's disease  and other synucleinopathies. αs can misfold and adopt a variety of morphologies but recent studies implicate oligomeric forms as the most cytotoxic species. both genetic mutations and chronic exposure to neurotoxins increase αs aggregation and intracellular reactive oxygen species , leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage in pd cell models.


RESULTS
here we show that curcumin can alleviate αs-induced toxicity, reduce ros levels and protect cells against apoptosis. we also show that both intracellular overexpression of αs and extracellular addition of oligomeric αs increase ros which induces apoptosis, suggesting that aggregated αs may induce similar toxic effects whether it is generated intra- or extracellulary.


CONCLUSIONS
since curcumin is a natural food pigment that can cross the blood brain barrier and has widespread medicinal uses, it has potential therapeutic value for treating pd and other neurodegenerative disorders.
