BACKGROUND
p <dig> is a transcription factor that plays an important role in skin epidermal development and differentiation. the p <dig> gene encodes for two major protein isoforms, those containing an amino-terminal trans-activation domain  and those lacking this domain . both the ta and Δn transcripts are also alternatively spliced at the 3' end producing proteins with unique c-termini that are designated as α, β and γ isoforms. recent research has suggested that Δnp <dig> is the predominant isoform expressed and active in keratinocytes.


RESULTS
to better elucidate the biological role of p <dig> in regulating gene expression in keratinocytes we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiments with Δnp63-specific antibodies. we included an additional step in the chip procedure to enrich for Δnp <dig> targets by screening the library of immunoprecipitated dna for its ability to bind recombinant gst-Δnp <dig>  cloning of Δnp63-chip-derived dna fragments identified more than  <dig> potential Δnp <dig> target loci that were located close to or embedded within known or predicted genes. identity of these target genes suggests that they may participate in a myriad of cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, signaling and metabolism. here we confirm the binding of Δnp <dig> to several of these genomic loci both by emsa and replicate chip assays. finally we show that the expression of many of these target genes is altered when Δnp <dig> levels in keratinocytes are reduced by sirna, further confirming that these are bona fide targets.


CONCLUSIONS
this unbiased genomic approach has allowed us to uncover functional targets of Δnp <dig> and serves as the initial step in further analysis of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that are governed by p <dig> in keratinocytes.
