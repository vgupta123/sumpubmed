BACKGROUND
switchgrass  is a herbaceous crop for the cellulosic biofuel feedstock development in the usa and europe. as switchgrass is a naturally outcrossing species, accurate identification of selfed progeny is important to producing inbreds, which can be used in the production of heterotic hybrids. development of a technically reliable, time-saving and easily used marker system is needed to quantify and characterize breeding origin of progeny plants of targeted parents.


RESULTS
genome-wide screening of  <dig> mapped microsatellite  markers was conducted, and  <dig>  produced clear and scorable bands on a pooled dna sample of eight switchgrass varieties. a total of  <dig> primer pairs were selected on the basis of their relatively even distribution in switchgrass genome and pcr amplification quality on  <dig> tetraploid genotypes. mean polymorphic information content value for the  <dig> markers was  <dig>  ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . from them, a core set of  <dig> loci, which had been mapped on  <dig> linkage groups, was further tested and optimized to develop  <dig> sets of duplex markers. most of  targeted, but non-allelic amplicons within each duplex were separated by more than 10-bp. using the established duplex pcr protocol, selfing ratio  was identified as 0% for a randomly selected open-pollinated ‘kanlow’ genotype grown in the field,  <dig> % for  <dig> field-grown plants of bagged inflorescences, and  <dig> % for a selected plant grown in a growth chamber.


CONCLUSIONS
the study developed a duplex ssr-based pcr protocol consisting of  <dig> markers, providing ample choices of non-tightly-linked loci in switchgrass whole genome, and representing a powerful, time-saving and easily used method for the identification of selfed progeny in switchgrass. the protocol should be a valuable tool in switchgrass breeding efforts.
