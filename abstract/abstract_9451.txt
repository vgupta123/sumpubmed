BACKGROUND
rice is both a food source for a majority of the world's population and an important model system. available functional genomics resources include targeted insertion mutagenesis and transgenic tools. while these can be powerful, a non-transgenic, unbiased targeted mutagenesis method that can generate a range of allele types would add considerably to the analysis of the rice genome. tilling , a general reverse genetic technique that combines traditional mutagenesis with high throughput methods for mutation discovery, is such a method.


RESULTS
to apply tilling to rice, we developed two mutagenized rice populations. one population was developed by treatment with the chemical mutagen ethyl methanesulphonate , and the other with a combination of sodium azide plus methyl-nitrosourea . to find induced mutations, target regions of  <dig> â€“ <dig>  kilobases were pcr amplified using gene specific primers labeled with fluorescent dyes. heteroduplexes were formed through denaturation and annealing of pcr products, mismatches digested with a crude preparation of cel i nuclease and cleaved fragments visualized using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. in  <dig> target genes screened, we identified  <dig> nucleotide changes in the ems-treated population and  <dig> in the az-mnu population.


CONCLUSIONS
we estimate that the density of induced mutations is two- to threefold higher than previously reported rice populations . by comparison to other plants used in public tilling services, we conclude that the populations described here would be suitable for use in a large scale tilling project.
