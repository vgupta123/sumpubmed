BACKGROUND
during vertebrate embryogenesis the initial stages of bone formation by endochondral ossification involve the aggregation and proliferation of mesenchymal cells into condensations. continued growth of the condensations and differentiation of the mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes results in the formation of cartilage templates, or anlagen, which prefigure the shape of the future bones. the chondrocytes in the anlagen further differentiate by undergoing a complex sequence of maturation and hypertrophy, and are eventually replaced by mineralized bone. regulation of the onset of chondrogenesis is incompletely understood, and would be informed by comprehensive analyses of in vivo gene expression.


RESULTS
tibial and fibular pre-condensed mesenchyme was microdissected from mouse hind limbs at  <dig>  dpc, and the corresponding condensations at  <dig>  dpc and cartilage anlagen at  <dig>  dpc. total rna was isolated, and crna generated by linear amplification was interrogated using mouse whole genome microarrays. differential expression was validated by quantitative pcr for agc <dig>  bmp8a, col2a <dig>  fgfr <dig>  foxa <dig>  gdf <dig>  klf <dig>  klf <dig>  lepre <dig>  ncad, sox <dig>  and trpv <dig>  further, independent validation of the microarray data was achieved by in situ hybridization to analyse the expression of lepre <dig>  pcdh <dig>  sox <dig>  and trpv <dig> from  <dig>  dpc to  <dig>  dpc during mouse hind limb development. we found significant differential expression of  <dig> genes during these early stages of chondrogenesis. of these,  <dig> genes were down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated. our studies characterized the expression pattern of gene families previously associated with chondrogenesis, such as adhesion molecules, secreted signalling molecules, transcription factors, and extracellular matrix components. gene ontology approaches identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes not previously identified during the initiation of chondrogenesis. these included several bmp, gdf, wnt, sox and fox family members.


CONCLUSIONS
these data represent the first global gene expression profiling analysis of chondrogenic tissues during in vivo development. they identify genes for further study on their functional roles in chondrogenesis, and provide a comprehensive and important resource for future studies on cartilage development and disease.
