BACKGROUND
the genome of classical laboratory strains of mice is an artificial mosaic of genomes originated from several mouse subspecies with predominant representation  of the mus m. domesticus component. mice of another subspecies, east european/asian mus m. musculus, can interbreed with the classical laboratory strains to generate hybrids with unprecedented phenotypic and genotypic variations. to study these variations in depth we prepared the first genomic large insert bac library from an inbred strain derived purely from the mus m. musculus-subspecies. the library will be used to seek and characterize genomic sequences controlling specific monogenic and polygenic complex traits, including modifiers of dominant and recessive mutations.


RESULTS
a representative mouse genomic bac library was derived from a female mouse of the pwd/ph inbred strain of mus m. musculus subspecies. the library consists of  <dig>  <dig> primary clones from which 97% contain an insert of  <dig> kb average size. the library represents an equivalent of  <dig>  Ã— mouse haploid genome, as estimated from the total number of clones carrying genomic dna inserts and from the average insert size. the clones were arrayed in duplicates onto eight high-density membranes that were screened with seven single-copy gene probes. the individual probes identified four to eleven positive clones, corresponding to  <dig> -fold coverage of the mouse genome. eighty-seven bac-ends of pwd/ph clones were sequenced, edited, and aligned with mouse c57bl/6j  genome. seventy-three bac-ends displayed unique hits on b <dig> genome and their alignment revealed  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  per  <dig> bp. insertions and deletions represented  <dig> % of the bac end sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
analysis of the novel genomic library for the pwd/ph inbred strain demonstrated coverage of almost seven mouse genome equivalents and a capability to recover clones for specific regions of pwd/ph genome. the single nucleotide polymorphism between the strains pwd/ph and c57bl/6j was  <dig> / <dig> bp, a value significantly higher than between classical laboratory strains. the library will serve as a resource for dissecting the phenotypic and genotypic variations between mice of the mus m. musculus subspecies and classical laboratory mouse strains.
