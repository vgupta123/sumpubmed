BACKGROUND
gene-targeted and genome-wide markers are crucial to advance evolutionary biology, agriculture, and biodiversity conservation by improving our understanding of genetic processes underlying adaptation and speciation. unfortunately, for eukaryotic species with large genomes it remains costly to obtain genome sequences and to develop genome resources such as genome-wide snps. a method is needed to allow gene-targeted, next-generation sequencing that is flexible enough to include any gene or number of genes, unlike transcriptome sequencing. such a method would allow sequencing of many individuals, avoiding ascertainment bias in subsequent population genetic analyses.

we demonstrate the usefulness of a recent technology, exon capture, for genome-wide, gene-targeted marker discovery in species with no genome resources. we use coding gene sequences from the domestic cow genome sequence  to capture , and subsequently sequence, thousands of exons of b. taurus, b. indicus, and bison bison . our capture array has probes for  <dig>  exons in  <dig>  genes, including  <dig> candidate genes with known function and of interest for their association with disease and other fitness traits.


RESULTS
we successfully sequenced and mapped exon sequences from across the  <dig> autosomes and x chromosome in the b. taurus genome sequence. exon capture and high-throughput sequencing identified thousands of putative snps spread evenly across all reference chromosomes, in all three individuals, including hundreds of snps in our targeted candidate genes.


CONCLUSIONS
this study shows exon capture can be customized for snp discovery in many individuals and for non-model species without genomic resources. our captured exome subset was small enough for affordable next-generation sequencing, and successfully captured exons from a divergent wild species using the domestic cow genome as reference.
