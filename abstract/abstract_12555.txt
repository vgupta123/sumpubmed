BACKGROUND
phylogenetic analyses provide a framework for examining the evolution of morphological and molecular diversity, interpreting patterns in biogeography, and achieving a stable classification. the generic and suprageneric relationships within mosquitoes  are poorly resolved, making these subjects difficult to address.


RESULTS
we carried out maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood, including bayesian, analyses on a data set consisting of six nuclear genes and  <dig> morphological characters to assess their ability to resolve relationships among  <dig> genera. we also estimated divergence times based on sequence data and fossil calibration points, using bayesian relaxed clock methods. strong support was recovered for the basal position and monophyly of the subfamily anophelinae and the tribes aedini and sabethini of subfamily culicinae. divergence times for major culicid lineages date to the early cretaceous.


CONCLUSIONS
deeper relationships within the family remain poorly resolved, suggesting the need for additional taxonomic sampling. our results support the notion of rapid radiations early in the diversification of mosquitoes.
