BACKGROUND
mechanosensing and its downstream responses are speculated to involve sensory complexes containing ca2+-permeable mechanosensitive channels. on recognizing osmotic signals, plant cells initiate activation of a widespread signal transduction network that induces second messengers and triggers inducible defense responses. characteristic early signaling events include ca2+ influx, protein phosphorylation and generation of reactive oxygen species . pharmacological analyses show ca2+ influx mediated by mechanosensitive ca2+ channels to influence induction of osmotic signals, including ros generation. however, molecular bases and regulatory mechanisms for early osmotic signaling events remain poorly elucidated.


RESULTS
we here identified and investigated osmca <dig>  the sole rice homolog of putative ca2+-permeable mechanosensitive channels in arabidopsis . osmca <dig> was specifically localized at the plasma membrane. a promoter-reporter assay suggested that osmca <dig> mrna is widely expressed in seed embryos, proximal and apical regions of shoots, and mesophyll cells of leaves and roots in rice. ca2+ uptake was enhanced in osmca1-overexpressing suspension-cultured cells, suggesting that osmca <dig> is involved in ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. hypo-osmotic shock-induced ros generation mediated by nadph oxidases was also enhanced in osmca1-overexpressing cells. we also generated and characterized osmca1-rnai transgenic plants and cultured cells; osmca1-suppressed plants showed retarded growth and shortened rachises, while osmca1-suppressed cells carrying ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin showed partially impaired changes in cytosolic free ca2+ concentration  induced by hypo-osmotic shock and trinitrophenol, an activator of mechanosensitive channels.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a sole mca ortholog in the rice genome and developed both overexpression and suppression lines. analyses of cultured cells with altered levels of this putative ca2+-permeable mechanosensitive channel indicate that osmca <dig> is involved in regulation of plasma membrane ca2+ influx and ros generation induced by hypo-osmotic stress in cultured rice cells. these findings shed light on our understanding of mechanical sensing pathways.
