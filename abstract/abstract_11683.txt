BACKGROUND
toll-like receptors  recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and are important mediators of the innate immune system. tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> are paralogs and located in tandem on the same chromosome in mammals. they form heterodimers with tlr <dig> and bind lipopeptide components of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial cell walls. to identify conserved stretches in tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  that may be important for their function, we compared their protein sequences in nine mammalian species.


RESULTS
the n-terminal sequences of the orthologous proteins showed greater similarity than corresponding paralog sequences. however, we identified a region of  <dig> amino acids towards the c-terminus of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  where paralogs had a greater degree of sequence identity than orthologs. preservation of dna sequence identity of paralogs in this region was observed in all nine mammalian species investigated, and is due to independent gene conversion events. the regions having undergone gene conversion in each species are almost identical and encode the leucine-rich repeat motifs  <dig> to  <dig>  the c-terminal cap motif, the transmembrane domain and most of the intracellular toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor  domain.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that, for a specific conserved region, divergence of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> is limited by gene conversion, most likely because of the need for co-evolution with multiple intracellular and extracellular binding partners. thus, gene conversion provides a mechanism for limiting the divergence of functional regions of protein paralogs, while allowing other domains to evolve diversified functions.
