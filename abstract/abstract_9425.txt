BACKGROUND
histamine-related drugs are commonly used in the treatment of vertigo and related vestibular disorders. the site of action of these drugs however has not been elucidated yet. recent works on amphibians showed that histamine h <dig> receptor antagonists, e.g. betahistine, inhibit the afferent discharge recorded from the vestibular nerve. to assess the expression of h <dig> histamine receptors in vestibular neurons, we performed mrna rt-pcr and immunofluorescence experiments in mouse scarpa's ganglia.


RESULTS
rt-pcr analysis showed the presence of h <dig> receptor mrna in mouse ganglia tissue. h <dig> protein expression was found in vestibular neurons characterized by large and roundish soma, which labeled for calretinin and calbindin.


CONCLUSIONS
the present results are consistent with calyx and dimorphic, but not bouton, afferent vestibular neurons expressing h <dig> receptors. this study provides a molecular substrate for the effects of histamine-related antivertigo drugs acting on  h <dig> receptors, and suggest a potential target for the treatment of vestibular disorders of peripheral origin.
