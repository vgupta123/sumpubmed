BACKGROUND
the two-spotted spider mite, tetranychus urticae, is infected with wolbachia, which have the ability to manipulate host reproduction and fitness. micrornas  are small non-coding rnas that are involved in many biological processes such as development, reproduction and host-pathogen interactions. although mirna was observed to involve in wolbachia-host interactions in the other insect systems, its roles have not been fully deciphered in the two-spotted spider mite.


RESULTS
small rna libraries of infected and uninfected t. urticae for both sexes  were constructed. by integrating the mrna data originated from the same samples, the target genes of the differentially expressed mirnas were predicted. then, go and pathway analyses were performed for the target genes. comparison of libraries showed that wolbachia infection significantly regulated  <dig> mirnas in females and  <dig> mirnas in males, with an overall suppression of mirnas in wolbachia-infected libraries. a comparison of the mirna and mrna data predicted that the differentially expressed mirnas negatively regulated  <dig> mrnas in females and  <dig> mrnas in males. an analysis of target genes showed that wolbachia-responsive mirnas regulated genes with function in sphingolipid metabolism, lysosome function, apoptosis and lipid transporting in both sexes, as well as reproduction in females.


CONCLUSIONS
comparisons of the mirna and mrna data can help to identify mirnas and mirna target genes involving in wolbachia-host interactions. the molecular targets identified in this study should be useful in further functional studies.
