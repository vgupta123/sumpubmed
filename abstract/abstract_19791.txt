BACKGROUND
in sequencing the genomes of two xenorhabdus species, we encountered a large number of sequence repeats and assembly anomalies that stalled finishing efforts. this included a stretch of about  <dig> kb that is over  <dig> % identical between the plasmid and chromosome of x. nematophila.


RESULTS
whole genome restriction maps of the sequenced strains were produced through optical mapping technology. these maps allowed rapid resolution of sequence assembly problems, permitted closing of the genome, and allowed correction of a large inversion in a genome assembly that we had considered finished.


CONCLUSIONS
our experience suggests that routine use of optical mapping in bacterial genome sequence finishing is warranted. when combined with data produced through  <dig> sequencing, an optical map can rapidly and inexpensively generate an ordered and oriented set of contigs to produce a nearly complete genome sequence assembly.
