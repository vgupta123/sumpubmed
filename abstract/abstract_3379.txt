BACKGROUND
repetitive sequences are the major components of the eukaryotic genomes. association of these repeats with transcribing sequences and their regulation in buffalo bubalus bubalis has remained largely unresolved.


RESULTS
we cloned and sequenced rsai repeat fragments pdp <dig>  pdp <dig>  pdp <dig>  pdp <dig> of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> base pairs, respectively from the buffalo, bubalus bubalis. upon characterization, these fragments were found to represent retrotransposons and part of some functional genes. the resultant clones showed cross hybridization only with buffalo, cattle, goat and sheep genomic dna. real time pcr, detected ~ <dig> Ã—  <dig> copies of pdp <dig>  ~  <dig> copies of pdp <dig> and pdp <dig> and ~  <dig> of pdp <dig> in buffalo, cattle, goat and sheep genomes, respectively. rsai repeats are transcriptionally active in somatic tissues and spermatozoa. accordingly, pdp <dig> showed maximum expression in lung, pdp <dig> and pdp <dig> both in kidney, and pdp <dig> in ovary. fluorescence in situ hybridization showed repeats to be distributed all across the chromosomes.


CONCLUSIONS
the data suggest that rsai repeats have been incorporated into the exonic regions of various transcribing genes, possibly contributing towards the architecture and evolution of the buffalo and related genomes. prospects of our present work in the context of comparative and functional genomics are highlighted.
