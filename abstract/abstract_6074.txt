BACKGROUND
the mechanisms that underlie autophagy in cerebral ischemia remain poorly defined. myeloid cell leukemia- <dig> , an anti-apoptotic member of the bcl- <dig> family of proteins, regulates the balance between autophagy and apoptosis. however, little is known regarding its expression profile and contribution to cell fate in the brain following ischemic stroke.


RESULTS
in this study, we investigated the expression profile and cellular distribution of mcl <dig> in brains from transient middle cerebral artery occlusion  model rats. brain slices from sham-operated control rats showed minimal immunoreactivity for mcl <dig>  mcl <dig> was mainly produced in neurons. immunoreactivity for mcl <dig> increased as early as  <dig> hours after mcao, peaked at  <dig> hours, and then declined, but still remained high, at  <dig> hours. mcl <dig> positive cells never colocalized with either cleaved caspase- <dig> or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp nick-end labeling-positive cells. both microtubule-associated protein  <dig> light chain  <dig>  and beclin- <dig> were evident in ischemic brain between  <dig> and  <dig> hours after mcao. most cells with strong lc <dig> staining were also labeled with beclin- <dig>  beclin- <dig> did colocalize with caspase- <dig> or mcl <dig>  beclin-1/caspase- <dig> positive cells displayed the characteristic features of apoptosis including cell shrinkage and pyknotic nuclei, whereas beclin-1/mcl <dig> positive cells had normal morphology. pretreatment with 3-methyladenine attenuated autophagy without affecting the level of mcl <dig> protein.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings demonstrate that the expression of mcl <dig> is involved in the survival of neuronal cells. in addition, the coexpression of mcl <dig> with beclin- <dig> may attenuate beclin-1-dependent autophagy during ischemic stroke in rats.
