BACKGROUND
several methods have been reported for strain typing of mycoplasma genitalium. the value of these methods has never been comparatively assessed. the aims of this study were: 1) to identify new potential genetic markers based on an analysis of short tandem repeat  sequences in the published m. genitalium genome sequence; 2) to apply previously and newly identified markers to a panel of clinical strains in order to determine the optimal combination for an efficient multi-locus genotyping system; 3) to further confirm sexual transmission of m. genitalium using the newly developed system.


RESULTS
we performed a comprehensive analysis of strs in the genome of the m. genitalium type strain g <dig> and identified  <dig> loci containing strs. in addition to one previously studied locus, mg <dig>  we chose two others, mg <dig> and mg <dig>  for further study. based on an analysis of  <dig> unrelated patient specimens from new orleans and scandinavia, the discriminatory indices  for these three markers were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. two other previously described markers, including single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the rrna genes  and snps in the mg <dig> gene  were found to have dis of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. a combination of mg309-strs and mg191-snps yielded almost perfect discrimination . an additional finding was that the rrna-snps distribution pattern differed significantly between scandinavia and new orleans. finally we applied multi-locus typing to further confirm sexual transmission using specimens from  <dig> unrelated patients and  <dig> concurrently infected couples. analysis of multi-locus genotype profiles using the five variable loci described above revealed  <dig> of the couples had concordant genotype profiles compared to only four examples of concordance among the  <dig> unrelated randomly selected patients.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that a combination of the mg309-strs and mg191-snps is efficient for general epidemiological studies and addition of mg307-strs and mg338-strs is potentially useful for sexual network studies of m. genitalium infection. the multi-locus typing analysis of  <dig> unrelated m. genitalium-infected individuals and  <dig> infected couples adds to the evidence that m. genitalium is sexually transmitted.
