BACKGROUND
polymorphic loci exist throughout the genomes of a population and provide the raw genetic material needed for a species to adapt to changes in the environment. the minor allele frequencies of rare single nucleotide polymorphisms  within a population have been difficult to track with next-generation sequencing , due to the high error rate of standard methods such as illumina sequencing.


RESULTS
we have developed a wet-lab protocol and variant-calling method that identifies both sequencing and pcr errors, called paired-end low error sequencing . to test the specificity and sensitivity of the pele-seq method, we sequenced control e. coli dna libraries containing known rare alleles present at frequencies ranging from  <dig> – <dig>  % of the total reads. pele-seq had higher specificity and sensitivity than standard libraries. we then used pele-seq to characterize rare alleles in a caenorhabditis remanei nematode worm population before and after laboratory adaptation, and found that minor and rare alleles can undergo large changes in frequency during lab-adaptation.


CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a method of rare allele detection that mitigates both sequencing and pcr errors, called pele-seq. pele-seq was evaluated using control e. coli populations and was then used to compare a wild c. remanei population to a lab-adapted population. the pele-seq method is ideal for investigating the dynamics of rare alleles in a broad range of reduced-representation sequencing methods, including targeted amplicon sequencing, rad-seq, ddrad, and gbs. pele-seq is also well-suited for whole genome sequencing of mitochondria and viruses, and for high-throughput rare mutation screens.
