BACKGROUND
carbon tetra chloride , an industrial solvent, is a hepatotoxic agent and it is the well established animal model for free radical-induced liver injury. the present investigation was carried out to establish the protective effect of natansnin, a novel dibenzoyl glycoside from salvinia natans against ccl <dig> induced oxidative stress and cellular degeneration in rat liver.


RESULTS
ccl <dig> significantly increased the levels of lipid peroxides, oxidized glutathione and decreased the levels of reduced glutathione, sod and cat. ccl <dig> induce marked histopathological changes and increase in the levels of apoptotic proteins. ccl <dig> treatment significantly increased the levels of apoptotic proteins such as caspases- <dig>  parp, bax, bid and cytochrome c and also increased the levels of inflammatory mediators inos and cox- <dig>  natansnin treatment significantly decreased the levels of ccl <dig> induced apoptotic proteins and inflammatory mediators. further natansinin treatment significantly inhibited the ccl <dig> induced apoptosis which was evident form the reduced tunel positive cells.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our study demonstrated the protective effect of natansnin against ccl <dig> induced oxidative stress and cellular degeneration in rat liver tissue. this protective effect of natansnin can be correlated to its direct antioxidant effect.
