BACKGROUND
the gene ontology  has been used in high-throughput omics research as a major bioinformatics resource. the hierarchical structure of go provides users a convenient platform for biological information abstraction and hypothesis testing. computational methods have been developed to identify functionally similar genes. however, none of the existing measurements take into account all the rich information in go. similarly, using these existing methods, web-based applications have been constructed to compute gene functional similarities, and to provide pure text-based outputs. without a graphical visualization interface, it is difficult for result interpretation.


RESULTS
we present intego <dig>  a web tool that allows researchers to calculate the go-based gene semantic similarities using seven widely used go-based similarity measurements. also, we provide an integrative measurement that synergistically integrates all the individual measurements to improve the overall performance. using html <dig> and cytoscape.js, we provide a graphical interface in intego <dig> to visualize the resulting gene functional association networks.


CONCLUSIONS
intego <dig> is an easy-to-use html <dig> based web tool. with it, researchers can measure gene or gene product functional similarity conveniently, and visualize the network of functional interactions in a graphical interface. intego <dig> can be accessed via http://mlg.hit.edu.cn:8089/.
