BACKGROUND
both thermotherapy and arsenic have been shown to be active against a broad spectrum of cancers. to reduce the limitations of conventional thermotherapy, improve therapeutic anticancer activity, reduce the toxicity of arsenic on normal tissue, and increase tissue-specific delivery, we prepared a nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> complex . we assessed the thermodynamic characteristics of this complex and validated the hyperthermia effect, when combined with magnetic fluid hyperthermia , on xenograft hela cells  in nude mice. we also measured the effect on the expression of cd44v <dig>  vegf-c, and mmp- <dig> which were related to cancer and/or metastasis.


RESULTS
the nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> particles were approximately spherical, had good dispersibility as evidenced by tem, and an average diameter of about  <dig> nm. with different concentrations of the nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> complex, the correspondingsuspension of magnetic particles could attain a steady temperature ranging from 42°c to 65°c when placed in amf for  <dig> min. thermochemotherapy with the nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> complex showed a significant inhibitory effect on the mass  and volume  of xenograft cervical tumors . in addition, thermochemotherapy with the nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> complex significantly inhibited the expression of cd44v <dig>  vegf-c, and mmp- <dig> mrna .


CONCLUSIONS
as2o3/fe3o <dig> complex combined with mfh had is a promising technique for the minimally invasive elimination of solid tumors and may be have anticancerometastasic effect by inhibiting the expression of cd44v <dig>  vegf-c, and mmp- <dig>
