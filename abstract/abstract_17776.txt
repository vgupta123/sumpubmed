BACKGROUND
floral nectar  contains not only energy-rich compounds to attract pollinators, but also defense chemicals and several proteins. however, proteomic analysis of fn has been hampered by the lack of publically available sequence information from nectar-producing plants. here we used next-generation sequencing and advanced proteomics to profile fn proteins in the opportunistic outcrossing wild tobacco, nicotiana attenuata.


RESULTS
we constructed a transcriptome database of n. attenuata and characterized its nectar proteome using lc-ms/ms. the fn proteins of n. attenuata included nectarins, sugar-cleaving enzymes , rnases, pathogen-related proteins, and lipid transfer proteins. natural variation in fn proteins of eleven n. attenuata accessions revealed a negative relationship between the accumulation of two abundant proteins, nectarin1b and nectarin <dig>  in addition, microarray analysis of nectary tissues revealed that protein accumulation in fn is not simply correlated with the accumulation of transcripts encoding fn proteins and identified a group of genes that were specifically expressed in the nectary.


CONCLUSIONS
natural variation of identified fn proteins in the ecological model plant n. attenuata suggests that nectar chemistry may have a complex function in plant-pollinator-microbe interactions.
