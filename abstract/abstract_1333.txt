BACKGROUND
tpx <dig>  is essential for spindle assembly, activation of the mitotic kinase aurora a and for triggering microtubule nucleation. homologs of tpx <dig> in chordata and plants were previously identified. currently, proteins of the tpx <dig> family have little structural information and only small parts are covered by defined protein domains.

methods
we have used computational sequence analyses and structural predictions of proteins of the tpx <dig> family, supported with circular dichroism  measurements.


RESULTS
here, we report our finding that the c-terminal domain of tpx <dig>  which is responsible of its microtubule nucleation capacity and is conserved in all members of the family, is actually formed by tandem repeats, covering well above 2/ <dig> of the protein. we propose that this region forms a flexible solenoid involved in protein-protein interactions. structural prediction and molecular modeling, combined with circular dichroism  measurements reveal a predominant alpha-helical content. furthermore, we identify full length homologs in fungi and shorter homologs with a different domain organization in diptera .


CONCLUSIONS
our results, represent the first computational and biophysical analysis of the tpx <dig> proteins family and help understand the structure and evolution of this conserved protein family to direct future structural studies.
