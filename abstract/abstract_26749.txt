BACKGROUND
bacteria may compete with yeast for nutrients during bioethanol production process, potentially causing economic losses. this is the first study aiming at the quantification and identification of lactic acid bacteria  present in the bioethanol industrial processes in different distilleries of brazil.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> lab isolates were obtained from four distilleries in  <dig> and  <dig>  the abundance of lab in the fermentation tanks varied between  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfus/ml. crude sugar cane juice contained  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> lab cfus. most of the lab isolates belonged to the genus lactobacillus according to rrna operon enzyme restriction profiles. a variety of lactobacillus species occurred throughout the bioethanol process, but the most frequently found species towards the end of the harvest season were l. fermentum and l. vini. the different rep-pcr patterns indicate the co-occurrence of distinct populations of the species l. fermentum and l. vini, suggesting a great intraspecific diversity. representative isolates of both species had the ability to grow in medium containing up to 10% ethanol, suggesting selection of ethanol tolerant bacteria throughout the process.


CONCLUSIONS
this study served as a first survey of the lab diversity in the bioethanol process in brazil. the abundance and diversity of lab suggest that they have a significant impact in the bioethanol process.
