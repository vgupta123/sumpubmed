BACKGROUND
toxoplasma gondii hijacks host cells to allow it to disseminate throughout a host animal; however, the migratory machinery involved in this process has not been well characterized. we examined the functional role of t. gondii cyclophilin  <dig>  in host cell recruitment using recombinant parasites transfected with tgcyp <dig> 


RESULTS
high levels of tgcyp <dig> enhanced il- <dig> production in cysteine-cysteine chemokine receptor  <dig>  knockout mice  that had been infected peritoneally with t. gondii. recruitment of cd11b+ cells to the infection site was enhanced in a ccr5-independent manner. t. gondii spread to several organs, particularly the liver, in a tgcyp18-dependent and ccr5-independent manner. additionally, ccl <dig> levels were upregulated in macrophages treated with recombinant protein tgcyp <dig> and in the peritoneal fluids of the infected ccr5−/− mice. furthermore, the chemokines involved in macrophage migration, ccl <dig> and cxcl <dig>  were upregulated in the livers of ccr5−/− mice infected with recombinant parasites that had been transfected with tgcyp <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
tgcyp <dig> may play a crucial role in macrophage migration, and in assisting with transport of t. gondii via ccr5-independent mechanisms. tgcyp <dig> may also play a role with ccl <dig> in the migration of macrophages to the site of infection, and with ccl <dig> and cxcl <dig> in the transport of t. gondii-infected cells to the liver.
