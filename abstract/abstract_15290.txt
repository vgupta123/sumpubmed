BACKGROUND
psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease with a known genetic component. our previously published psoriasis genome-wide association study identified dozens of novel susceptibility loci in han chinese. however, these markers explained only a small fraction of the estimated heritable component of psoriasis. to better understand the unknown yet likely polygenic architecture in psoriasis, we applied a linear mixed model to quantify the variation in the liability to psoriasis explained by common genetic markers  in a han chinese population.


RESULTS
we explored the polygenic genetic architecture of psoriasis using genome-wide association data from  <dig>  han chinese individuals. we estimated that  <dig> %  of the variation in the liability to psoriasis is captured by common genotyped and imputed variants. we discuss these results in the context of the strong association between hla variants and psoriasis. we also show that the variance explained by each chromosome is linearly correlated to its length , and quantify the impact of a polygenic effect on the prediction and diagnosis of psoriasis.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that psoriasis has a substantial polygenic component, which not only has implications for the development of genetic diagnostics and prognostics for psoriasis, but also suggests that more individual variants contributing to psoriasis may be detected if sample sizes in future association studies are increased.
