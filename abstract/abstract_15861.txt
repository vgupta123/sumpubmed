BACKGROUND
dicer is an rnase iii-ribonuclease that initiates the formation of small interfering rnas as a defence against genomic parasites such as retrotransposons. despite intensive characterization in mammalian species, the biological functions of dicer in controlling retrotransposable elements of the non-mammalian vertebrate are poorly understood. in this report, we examine the role of chicken dicer in controlling the activity of chicken cr <dig> retrotransposable elements in a chicken-human hybrid dt <dig> cell line employing a conditional loss-of-dicer function.


RESULTS
retrotransposition is detrimental to host genome stability and thus eukaryotic cells have developed mechanisms to limit the expansion of retrotransposons by dicer-mediated rnai silencing pathways. however, the mechanisms that control the activity and copy numbers of transposable elements in chicken remain unclear. here, we describe how the loss of dicer in chicken cells does not reactivate endogenous chicken cr <dig> retrotransposons with impaired rnai machinery, suggesting that the control of chicken cr <dig> is independent of dicer-induced rnai silencing. in contrast, upon introduction of a functionally active human l <dig> retrotransposable element that contains an active 5' utr promoter, the dicer-deficient chicken cells show a strong increase in the accumulation of human l <dig> transcripts and retrotransposition activity, highlighting a major difference between chicken cr <dig> and other mammalian l <dig> retrotransposons.


CONCLUSIONS
our data provide evidence that chicken cr <dig> retrotransposons, unlike their mammalian l <dig> counterparts, do not undergo retrotransposition because most cr <dig> retrotransposons are truncated or mutated at their 5'utr promoters and thus are not subjected to dicer-mediated rnai-silencing control.
