BACKGROUND
basement matrices such as matrigel™ and geltrex™ are used in a variety of cell culture assays of anchorage-dependent differentiation including endothelial cell tube formation assays. the volumes of matrix recommended for these assays  are costly, limit working distances for microscopy, and require cell detachment for subsequent molecular analysis. here we describe the development and validation of a thin-layer angiogenesis  assay for assessing the angiogenic potential of endothelial cells that overcomes these limitations.


RESULTS
geltrex™ basement matrix at  <dig> μl/cm <dig> in 24-well  or 96-well  plates supports endothelial cell differentiation into tube-like structures in a comparable manner to the standard larger volumes of matrix. since working distances are reduced, high-resolution single cell microscopy, including dic and confocal imaging, can be used readily. using mitotracker dye we now demonstrate, for the first time, live mitochondrial dynamics and visualise the 3-dimensional network of mitochondria present in differentiated endothelial cells. using a standard commercial total rna extraction kit  we also show direct rna extraction and rt-qpcr from differentiated endothelial cells without the need to initially detach cells from their supporting matrix.


CONCLUSIONS
we present here a new thin-layer assay  for measuring the anchorage-dependent differentiation of endothelial cells into tube-like structures which retains all the characteristics of the traditional approach but with the added benefit of a greatly lowered cost and better compatibility with other techniques, including rt-qpcr and high-resolution microscopy.
