BACKGROUND
cultivated chickpea  has a narrow genetic base making it difficult for breeders to produce new elite cultivars with durable resistance to major biotic and abiotic stresses. as an alternative to genome mapping, microarrays have recently been applied in crop species to identify and assess the function of putative genes thought to be involved in plant abiotic stress and defence responses. in the present study, a cdna microarray approach was taken in order to determine if the transcription of genes, from a set of previously identified putative stress-responsive genes from chickpea and its close relative lathyrus sativus, were altered in chickpea by the three abiotic stresses; drought, cold and high-salinity. for this, chickpea genotypes known to be tolerant and susceptible to each abiotic stress were challenged and gene expression in the leaf, root and/or flower tissues was studied. the transcripts that were differentially expressed among stressed and unstressed plants in response to the particular stress were analysed in the context of tolerant/susceptible genotypes.


RESULTS
the transcriptional change of more than two fold was observed for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes after drought, cold and high-salinity treatments, respectively. among these, two,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were consensually differentially expressed  between tolerant and susceptible genotypes studied for drought, cold and high-salinity, respectively. the genes that were de in tolerant and susceptible genotypes under abiotic stresses code for various functional and regulatory proteins. significant differences in stress responses were observed within and between tolerant and susceptible genotypes highlighting the multiple gene control and complexity of abiotic stress response mechanism in chickpea.


CONCLUSIONS
the annotation of these genes suggests that they may have a role in abiotic stress response and are potential candidates for tolerance/susceptibility.
