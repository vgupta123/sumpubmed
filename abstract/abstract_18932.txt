BACKGROUND
the increased selection pressure of the herbicide glyphosate has played a role in the evolution of glyphosate-resistance in weedy species, an issue that is becoming a threat to global agriculture. the molecular components involved in the cellular toxicity response to this herbicide at the expression level are still unidentified.


RESULTS
in this study, we identify the protein kinase gcn <dig> as a cellular component that fosters the action of glyphosate in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana. comparative studies using wild-type and gcn <dig> knock-out mutant seedlings show that the molecular programme that the plant deploys after the treatment with the herbicide, is compromised in gcn <dig>  moreover, gcn <dig> adult plants show a lower inhibition of photosynthesis, and both seedlings and adult gcn <dig> plants accumulate less shikimic acid than wild-type after treatment with glyphosate.


CONCLUSIONS
these results points to an unknown gcn2-dependent factor involved in the cascade of events triggered by glyphosate in plants. data suggest either that the herbicide does not equally reach the target-enzyme in a gcn <dig> background, or that a decreased flux in the shikimate pathway in a gcn <dig> plants minimize the impact of enzyme inhibition.
