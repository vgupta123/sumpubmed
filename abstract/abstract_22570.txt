BACKGROUND
the oxidative burst is one of the major antimicrobial mechanisms adopted by macrophages. the wky rat strain is uniquely susceptible to experimentally induced macrophage-dependent crescentic glomerulonephritis . we previously identified the ap- <dig> transcription factor jund as a determinant of macrophage activation in wky bone marrow-derived macrophages . jund is over-expressed in wky bmdms and its silencing reduces fc receptor-mediated oxidative burst in these cells.


RESULTS
here we combined jund rna interference with microarray analyses alongside chip-sequencing  analyses in wky bmdms to investigate jund-mediated control of macrophage activation in basal and lipopolysaccharide  stimulated cells. microarray analysis following jund silencing showed that jund activates and represses gene expression with marked differential expression  for genes linked with oxidative stress and il-1β expression. these results were complemented by comparing whole genome expression in wky bmdms with jund congenic strain  bmdms which express lower levels of jund. chip-seq analyses demonstrated that the increased expression of jund resulted in an increased number of binding events in wky bmdms compared to wky.lcrgn <dig> bmdms. combined chip-seq and microarray analysis revealed a set of primary jund-targets through which jund exerts its effect on oxidative stress and il-1β synthesis in basal and lps-stimulated macrophages.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings demonstrate how genetically determined levels of a transcription factor affect its binding sites in primary cells and identify jund as a key regulator of oxidative stress and il-1β synthesis in primary macrophages, which may play a role in susceptibility to crgn.
