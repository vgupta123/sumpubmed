BACKGROUND
the multilocus variable-number tandem repeat  analysis  technique has been developed for fine typing of many bacterial species. the genomic sequences of neisseria meningitidis strains z <dig>  mc <dig> and fam <dig> have been available for searching potential vntr loci by computer software. in this study, we developed and evaluated a mlva method for molecular subtyping and phylogenetic analysis of n. meningitidis strains.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> vntr loci were identified for subtyping and phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> n. meningitidis isolates, which had previously been characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  and multilocus sequence typing. the number of alleles ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> for the  <dig> vntr loci; theoretically, the numbers of alleles can generate more than  <dig> Ã—  <dig> mlva types. in total,  <dig> mlva types were identified in the  <dig> isolates, indicating that mlva is powerful in discriminating n. meningitidis strains. in phylogenetic analysis with the minimal spanning tree method, clonal relationships, established with mlva types, agreed well with those built with st types.


CONCLUSIONS
our study indicates that the mlva method has a higher degree of resolution than pfge in discriminating n. meningitidis isolates and may be a useful tool for phylogenetic studies of strains evolving over different time scales.
