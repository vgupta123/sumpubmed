BACKGROUND
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  —aspirin, naproxen, nimesulide, and piroxicam— lowered activation of type ii camp-dependent protein kinase a  in isolated rat adipocytes, decreasing adrenaline- and dibutyryl camp -stimulated lipolysis. the molecular bases of insulin-like actions of nsaid were studied.


RESULTS
based on the reported inhibition of lipolysis by h2o <dig>  catalase was successfully used to block nsaid inhibitory action on bt2camp-stimulated lipolysis. nsaid, at micromolar range, induced an h2o <dig> burst in rat adipocyte plasma membranes and in whole adipocytes. nsaid-mediated rise of h2o <dig> was abrogated in adipocyte plasma membranes by: diphenyleneiodonium, an inhibitor of nadph oxidase ; the nox <dig> antibody; and cytochrome c, trapping the nox-formed superoxide. these three compounds prevented the inhibition of bt2camp-stimulated lipolysis by nsaids. inhibition of aquaporin-mediated h2o <dig> transport with agno <dig> in adipocytes allowed nox activation but prevented the lipolysis inhibition promoted by nsaid: i.e., once synthesized, h2o <dig> must reach the lipolytic machinery. since insulin inhibits adrenaline-stimulated lipolysis, the effect of aspirin on isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis in rat adipocytes was studied. as expected, isoproterenol-mediated lipolysis was blunted by both insulin and aspirin.


CONCLUSIONS
nsaids activate nox <dig> in adipocytes to produce h2o <dig>  which impairs camp-dependent pka-ii activation, thus preventing isoproterenol-activated lipolysis. h2o <dig> signaling in adipocytes is a novel and important cyclooxygenase-independent effect of nsaid.
