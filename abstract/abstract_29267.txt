BACKGROUND
human phospholipid scramblase  <dig>  was initially identified as a ca2+ dependent phospholipid translocator involved in disrupting membrane asymmetry. recent reports revealed that hplscr <dig> acts as a multifunctional signaling molecule rather than functioning as scramblase. hplscr <dig> is overexpressed in a variety of tumor cells and is known to interact with a number of protein molecules implying diverse functions.


RESULTS
in this study, the nuclease activity of recombinant hplscr <dig> and its biochemical properties have been determined. point mutations were generated to identify the critical region responsible for the nuclease activity. recombinant hplscr <dig> exhibits mg2+ dependent nuclease activity with an optimum ph and temperature of  <dig>  and 37 °c respectively. experiments with amino acid modifying reagents revealed that histidine, cysteine and arginine residues were crucial for its function. hplscr <dig> has five histidine residues and point mutations of histidine residues to alanine in hplscr <dig> resulted in 60 % loss in nuclease activity. thus histidine residues could play a critical role in the nuclease activity of hplscr <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report on the novel nuclease activity of the multi-functional hplscr <dig>  hplscr <dig> shows a metal dependent nuclease activity which could play a role in key cellular processes that needs to be further investigated.
