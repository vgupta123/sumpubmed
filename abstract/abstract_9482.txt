BACKGROUND
the pdz-lim proteins are a family of signalling adaptors that interact with the actin cross-linking protein, α-actinin, via their pdz domains or via internal regions between the pdz and lim domains. three of the pdz-lim proteins have a conserved 26-residue zm motif in the internal region, but the structure of the internal region is unknown.


RESULTS
in this study, using circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance , we showed that the alp internal region  was largely unfolded in solution, but was able to interact with the α-actinin rod domain in vitro, and to co-localize with α-actinin on stress fibres in vivo. nmr analysis revealed that the titration of alp with the α-actinin rod domain induces stabilization of alp. a synthetic peptide  that contained the n-terminal half of the zm motif was found to interact directly with the α-actinin rod domain in surface plasmon resonance  measurements. short deletions at or before the zm motif abrogated the localization of alp to actin stress fibres.


CONCLUSIONS
the internal region of alp appeared to be largely unstructured but functional. the zm motif defined part of the interaction surface between alp and the α-actinin rod domain.
