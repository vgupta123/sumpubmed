BACKGROUND
pseudogenes are traditionally considered “dead” genes, therefore lacking biological functions. this view has however been challenged during the last decade. this is the case of the protein phosphatase  <dig> regulatory subunit  <dig>  or inhibitor- <dig> gene family, for which several incomplete copies exist scattered throughout the genome.


RESULTS
in this study, the pseudogenization process of ppp1r <dig> was analyzed. ten ppp1r2-related pseudogenes , highly similar to ppp1r <dig>  were retrieved from the human genome assembly present in the databases. the phylogenetic analysis of mammalian ppp1r <dig> and related pseudogenes suggested that ppp1r2p <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> retroposons appeared before the great mammalian radiation, while the remaining pseudogenes are primate-specific and retroposed at different times during primate evolution. although considered inactive, four of these pseudogenes seem to be transcribed and possibly possess biological functions. given the role of ppp1r <dig> in sperm motility, the presence of these proteins was assessed in human sperm, and two ppp1r2-related proteins were detected, ppp1r2p <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig>  signatures of negative and positive selection were also detected in ppp1r2p <dig>  further suggesting a role as a functional protein.


CONCLUSIONS
the results show that contrary to initial observations ppp1r2-related pseudogenes are not simple bystanders of the evolutionary process but may rather be at the origin of genes with novel functions.
