BACKGROUND
regulatory t cells  play an essential role in the control of the immune response. treg cells represent important targets for therapeutic interventions of the immune system. therefore, it will be very important to understand in more detail which genes are specifically activated in treg cells versus t helper  cells, and which gene regulatory circuits may be involved in specifying and maintaining treg cell homeostasis.


RESULTS
we isolated treg and th cells from a genetically diverse family of  <dig> bxd type recombinant inbred strains and the fully inbred parental strains of this family--c57bl/6j and dba/2j. subsequently genome-wide gene expression studies were performed from the isolated treg and th cells. a comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of these cell populations allowed us to identify many novel differentially expressed genes. analysis of cis- and trans-expression quantitative trait loci  highlighted common and unique regulatory mechanisms that are active in the two cell types. trans-eqtl regions were found for the treg functional genes nrp <dig>  stat <dig> and ikzf <dig>  analyses of the respective qtl intervals suggested several candidate genes that may be involved in regulating these genes in treg cells. similarly, possible candidate genes were found which may regulate the expression of f2rl <dig>  ctla <dig>  klrb1f. in addition, we identified a focused group of candidate genes that may be important for the maintenance of self-tolerance and the prevention of allergy.


CONCLUSIONS
variation of expression across the strains allowed us to find many novel gene-interaction networks in both t cell subsets. in addition, these two data sets enabled us to identify many differentially expressed genes and to nominate candidate genes that may have important functions for the maintenance of self-tolerance and the prevention of allergy.
