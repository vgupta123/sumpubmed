BACKGROUND
actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the causative agent of porcine contagious pleuropneumonia, a highly contagious respiratory infection in pigs, and all the  <dig> serotypes are able to cause disease. current vaccines including subunit vaccines could not provide satisfactory protection against a. pleuropneumoniae. in this study, the immunoproteomic approach was applied to the analysis of extracellular and outer membrane proteins of a. pleuropneumoniae jl <dig> serotype  <dig> for the identification of novel immunogenic proteins for a. pleuropneumoniae.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> immunogenic proteins were identified from outer membrane and extracellular proteins of jl <dig> serotype  <dig>  of which  <dig> were known antigens and  <dig> were novel immunogenic proteins for a. pleuropneumoniae.


CONCLUSIONS
these data provide information about novel immunogenic proteins for a. pleuropneumoniae serotype  <dig>  and are expected to aid in development of novel vaccines against a. pleuropneumoniae.
