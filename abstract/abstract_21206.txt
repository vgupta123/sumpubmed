BACKGROUND
surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  was applied to analyze the protein profiles in both somatic and metabolic extracts of aspergillus species. the study was carried out on some aspergillus species within the fumigati section . the aim was to validate whether mass spectrometry protein profiles can be used as specific signatures to discriminate different aspergillus species or even mutants within the same species.


RESULTS
the growth conditions and the seldi-tof parameters were determined to generate characteristic protein profiles of somatic and metabolic extracts of aspergillus fumigatus strains using five different proteinchips®, eight growth conditions combining two temperatures, two media and two oxygenation conditions. nine strains were investigated: three wild-types and four natural abnormally pigmented mutant strains of a. fumigatus and two strains of a. lentulus. a total of  <dig> fungal extracts were prepared. the spectra obtained are protein signatures linked to the physiological states of fungal strains depending on culture conditions. the best resolutions were obtained using the chromatographic surfaces cm <dig>  np <dig> and h <dig> with fractions of fungi grown on modified sabouraud medium at 37°c in static condition. under these conditions, the seldi-tof analysis allowed a. fumigatus and a. lentulus strains to be grouped into distinct clusters.


CONCLUSIONS
seldi-tof analysis distinguishes a. fumigatus from a. lentulus strains and moreover, permits separate clusters of natural abnormally pigmented a. fumigatus strains to be obtained. in addition, this methodology allowed us to point out fungal components specifically produced by a wild-type strain or natural mutants. it offers attractive potential for further studies of the aspergillus biology or pathogenesis.
