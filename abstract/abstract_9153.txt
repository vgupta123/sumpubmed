BACKGROUND
oncogenesis in breast cancer is often associated with excess estrogen receptor α activation and overexpression of its coactivators. lrp <dig> is both an erα target gene and an erα coactivator, and plays a crucial role in erα activation and proliferation of mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells. however, the regulation of the functional availability of this coactivator protein is not yet clear.


RESULTS
yeast two-hybrid screening, gst pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation  identified the cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein keratin  <dig>  as a novel lrp16-interacting protein. fluorescence analysis revealed that gfp-tagged lrp <dig> was primarily localized in the nuclei of mock-transfected mcf- <dig> cells but was predominantly present in the cytoplasm of k18-transfected cells. immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that the amount of cytoplasmic lrp <dig> was markedly increased in cells overexpressing k <dig> whereas nuclear levels were depressed. conversely, knockdown of endogenous k <dig> expression in mcf- <dig> cells significantly decreased the cytoplasmic levels of lrp <dig> and increased levels in the nucleus. coip failed to detect any interaction between k <dig> and erα, but ectopic expression of k <dig> in mcf- <dig> cells significantly blunted the association of lrp <dig> with erα, attenuated erα-activated reporter gene activity, and decreased estrogen-stimulated target gene expression by inhibiting erα recruitment to dna. furthermore, brdu incorporation assays revealed that k <dig> overexpression blunted the estrogen-stimulated increase of s-phase entry of mcf- <dig> cells. by contrast, knockdown of k <dig> in mcf- <dig> cells significantly increased erα-mediated signaling and promoted cell cycle progression.


CONCLUSIONS
k <dig> can effectively associate with and sequester lrp <dig> in the cytoplasm, thus attenuating the final output of erα-mediated signaling and estrogen-stimulated cell cycle progression of mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells. loss of k <dig> increases the functional availability of lrp <dig> to erα and promotes the proliferation of erα-positive breast tumor cells. k <dig> plays an important functional role in regulating the erα signaling pathway.
