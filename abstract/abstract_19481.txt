BACKGROUND
a stereotyped array of body wall muscles enables precision and stereotypy of animal movements. in drosophila, each syncytial muscle forms via fusion of one founder cell  with multiple fusion competent myoblasts . the specific morphology of each muscle, i.e. distinctive shape, orientation, size and skeletal attachment sites, reflects the specific combination of identity transcription factors  expressed by its fc. here, we addressed three questions: are fcm nuclei naive? what is the selectivity and temporal sequence of transcriptional reprogramming of fcms recruited into growing syncytium? is transcription of generic myogenic and identity realisation genes coordinated during muscle differentiation?


RESULTS
the tracking of nuclei in developing muscles shows that fcm nuclei are competent to be transcriptionally reprogrammed to a given muscle identity, post fusion. in situ hybridisation to nascent transcripts for fcm, fc-generic and itf genes shows that this reprogramming is progressive, beginning by repression of fcm-specific genes in fused nuclei, with some evidence that fc nuclei retain specific characteristics. transcription of identity realisation genes is linked to itf activation and regulated at levels of both transcription initiation rate and period of transcription. the generic muscle differentiation programme is activated independently.


CONCLUSIONS
transcription reprogramming of fused myoblast nuclei is progressive, such that nuclei within a syncytial fibre at a given time point during muscle development are heterogeneous with regards to specific gene transcription. this comprehensive view of the dynamics of transcriptional programming of post-mitotic nuclei within syncytial cells provides a new framework for understanding the transcriptional control of the lineage diversity of multinucleated cells.
