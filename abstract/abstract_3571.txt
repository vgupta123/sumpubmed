BACKGROUND
the role of micrornas in gene regulation has been well established. the extent of mirna regulation also increases with increasing genome complexity. though the number of genes appear to be equal between human and zebrafish, substantially less micrornas have been discovered in zebrafish compared to human . it appears that most of the mirnas in zebrafish are yet to be discovered.


RESULTS
we sequenced small rnas from brain, gut, liver, ovary, testis, eye, heart and embryo of zebrafish. in brain, gut and liver sequencing was done sex specifically. majority of the sequenced reads  mapped to known mirnas, with the exception of ovary  and testis . using the mirna discovery tool , we discovered novel mirnas from the unannotated reads that ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %, with exceptions of ovary  and testis . the prediction tool identified a total of  <dig> novel pre-mirnas. we compared expression of mirnas between different tissues and between males and females to identify tissue associated and sex associated mirnas respectively. these mirnas could serve as putative biomarkers for these tissues. the brain and liver had highest number of tissue associated  and sex associated  mirnas, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
this study comprehensively identifies tissue and sex associated mirnas in zebrafish. further, we have discovered  <dig> novel pre-mirnas  as a genomic resource which can facilitate further investigations to understand mirna-mrna gene regulatory networks in zebrafish which will have implications in understanding the function of human homologs.
