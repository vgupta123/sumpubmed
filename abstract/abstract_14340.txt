BACKGROUND
protein secondary structure prediction method based on probabilistic models such as hidden markov model  appeals to many because it provides meaningful information relevant to sequence-structure relationship. however, at present, the prediction accuracy of pure hmm-type methods is much lower than that of machine learning-based methods such as neural networks  or support vector machines .


RESULTS
in this paper, we report a new method of probabilistic nature for protein secondary structure prediction, based on dynamic bayesian networks . the new method models the psi-blast profile of a protein sequence using a multivariate gaussian distribution, and simultaneously takes into account the dependency between the profile and secondary structure and the dependency between profiles of neighboring residues. in addition, a segment length distribution is introduced for each secondary structure state. tests show that the dbn method has made a significant improvement in the accuracy compared to other pure hmm-type methods. further improvement is achieved by combining the dbn with an nn, a method called dbnn, which shows better q <dig> accuracy than many popular methods and is competitive to the current state-of-the-arts. the most interesting feature of dbn/dbnn is that a significant improvement in the prediction accuracy is achieved when combined with other methods by a simple consensus.


CONCLUSIONS
the dbn method using a gaussian distribution for the psi-blast profile and a high-ordered dependency between profiles of neighboring residues produces significantly better prediction accuracy than other hmm-type probabilistic methods. owing to their different nature, the dbn and nn combine to form a more accurate method dbnn. future improvement may be achieved by combining dbnn with a method of svm type.
