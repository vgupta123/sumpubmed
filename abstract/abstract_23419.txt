BACKGROUND
dna hypermethylation is a key epigenetic mechanism for the silencing of many genes in cancer. hinokitiol, a tropolone-related natural compound, is known to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and has anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities. however, the relationship between hinokitiol and dna methylation is not clear. the aim of our study was to explore whether hinokitiol has an inhibitory ability on the dna methylation in colon cancer cells.


RESULTS
mtt data showed that hinokitiol had higher sensitivity in colon cancer cells, hct- <dig> and sw <dig>  than in normal colon cells, ccd18co. hinokitiol reduced dna methyltransferase  <dig>  and ubiquitin-like plant homeodomain and ring finger domain  <dig>  expression in hct- <dig> cells. in addition, the expression of ten-eleven translocation protein  <dig> , a known dna demethylation initiator, was increased by hinokitiol treatment. elisa and facs data showed that hinokitiol increased the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine  level in the both colon cancer cells, but 5-methylcytosine  level was not changed. furthermore, hinokitiol significantly restored mrna expression of o6-methylguanine dna methyltransferase , carbohydrate sulfotransferase  <dig> , and b-cell translocation gene  <dig>  concomitant with reduction of methylation status in hct- <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that hinokitiol may exert dna demethylation by inhibiting the expression of dnmt <dig> and uhrf <dig> in colon cancer cells.
