BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is an important human opportunistic pathogen residing on skin and mucosae of healthy people. pigs have been identified as a source of human colonization and infection with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  and novel measures are needed to control zoonotic transmission. a recent longitudinal study indicated that a minority of pigs characterized by high nasal load and stable carriage may be responsible for the maintenance of s. aureus within farms. the primary objective of the present study was to detect genetic loci associated with nasal carriage of s. aureus in danish crossbred pigs .


RESULTS
fifty-six persistent carriers and  <dig> non-carriers selected from  <dig> farms surveyed in the previous longitudinal study were genotyped using illumina’s porcine snp <dig> beadchip. in addition, spa typing was performed on 126 s. aureus isolates from  <dig> pigs to investigate possible relationships between host and s. aureus genotypes. a single snp  on chromosome  <dig> was found to be associated with nasal carriage of s. aureus at a genome-wide level after permutation testing  whereas the association of a neighboring snp was found to be borderline . typing of s. aureus isolates led to detection of  <dig> spa types belonging to the three main s. aureus clonal complexes  previously described in pigs . individual carriers often harbored multiple s. aureus genotypes and the host-pathogen interaction seems to be independent of s. aureus genotype.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest it may be possible to select pigs genetically resistant to s. aureus nasal colonization as a tool to control transmission of livestock-associated mrsa to humans.
