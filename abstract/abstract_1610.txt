BACKGROUND
next generation sequencing provides a powerful tool to study genome structure in species whose genomes are far from being completely sequenced. in this work we describe and compare different computational approaches to evaluate the repetitive component of the genome of sunflower, by using medium/low coverage illumina or  <dig> libraries.


RESULTS
by varying sequencing technology , coverage , assemblers and assembly procedures, six different genomic databases were produced. the annotation of these databases showed that they were composed of different proportions of repetitive dna families. the final assembly of the sequences belonging to the six databases produced a whole genome set of  <dig>  contigs. the redundancy of each contig was estimated by mapping the whole genome set with a large illumina read set and measuring the number of matched illumina reads. the repetitive component amounted to 81% of the sunflower genome, that is composed mainly of numerous families of gypsy and copia retrotransposons. also many families of non autonomous retrotransposons and dna transposons  were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
the results substantially matched those previously obtained by using a sanger-sequenced shotgun library and a standard  <dig> whole-genome-shotgun approach, indicating the reliability of the proposed procedures also for other species. the repetitive sequences were collected to produce a database, sunrep, that will be useful for the annotation of the sunflower genome sequence and for studying the genome evolution in dicotyledons.
