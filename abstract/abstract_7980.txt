BACKGROUND
aphids are among the most destructive pests in temperate climates, causing significant damage on several crops including tomato. we carried out a transcriptomic and proteomic study to get insights into the molecular mechanisms and dynamics of the tomato response to the macrosyphum euphorbiae aphid.


RESULTS
the time course analysis of aphid infestation indicated a complex, dynamic pattern of gene expression. several biological functions were affected and genes related to the stress and defence response were the most represented. the gene ontology categories of the differentially expressed genes  and identified proteins  indicated that the tomato response is characterized by an increased oxidative stress accompanied by the production of proteins involved in the detoxification of oxygen radicals. aphids elicit a defense reaction based on the cross-communication of different hormone-related signaling pathways such as those related to the salicylic acid , jasmonic acid , ethylene and brassinosteroids. among them, the sa-signaling pathway and stress-responsive sa-dependent genes play a dominant role. furthermore, tomato response is characterized by a reduced accumulation of photosynthetic proteins and a modification of the expression of various cell wall related genes.


CONCLUSIONS
our work allowed a more comprehensive understanding of the signaling events and the defense dynamics of the tomato response to aphids in a compatible interaction and, based on experimental data, a model of the tomatoâ€“aphid molecular interaction was proposed. considering the rapid advancement of tomato genomics, this information will be important for the development of new protection strategies.
