BACKGROUND
cell-to-cell communication ) co-ordinates bacterial behaviour at a population level. consequently the behaviour of a natural multi-species community is likely to depend at least in part on co-existing qs and quorum quenching  activities. here we sought to discover novel n-acylhomoserine lactone -dependent qs and qq strains by investigating a bacterial community associated with the rhizosphere of ginger  growing in the malaysian rainforest.


RESULTS
by using a basal growth medium containing n-homoserine lactone  as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen, the ginger rhizosphere associated bacteria were enriched for strains with ahl-degrading capabilities. three isolates belonging to the genera acinetobacter , burkholderia  and klebsiella  were identified and selected for further study. strains gg <dig> and se <dig> exhibited the broadest spectrum of ahl-degrading activities via lactonolysis while gg <dig> reduced 3-oxo-ahls to the corresponding 3-hydroxy compounds. in gg <dig> and gg <dig>  qq was found to co-exist with ahl-dependent qs and gg <dig> was shown to inactivate both self-generated and exogenously supplied ahls. gg <dig>  gg <dig> and se <dig> were each able to attenuate virulence factor production in both human and plant pathogens.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively our data show that ginger rhizosphere bacteria which make and degrade a wide range of ahls are likely to play a collective role in determining the qs-dependent phenotype of a polymicrobial community.
