BACKGROUND
rna interference is a very effective approach for studies on gene function and may be an efficient method for controlling pests. trehalase is a key gene in the chitin biosynthesis pathway in insects. five trehalase genes have been cloned in tribolium castaneum, though it is not known whether the detailed functions of these trehalases can be targeted for pest control.


RESULTS
the functions of all five trehalase genes were studied using rnai, and the most important results showed that the expression of all  <dig> genes decreased significantly from  <dig> to 72 h compared with the control groups, except gp <dig> at 72 h, when the expression of the tctre <dig> gene was suppressed. the results also revealed different abnormal phenotypes, and the observed mortality rates ranged from  <dig> to 42 %. the qrt-pcr results showed that the expression of tps, gs, two gp, chs1a and chs1b genes decreased significantly, while that of the chs <dig> gene decreased or increased after rnai after the five trehalases were silenced at 48 h. in addition, tps gene expression decreased from  <dig> to 72 h after dstctre injection.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate that silencing of any individual trehalase gene, especially tre1- <dig> and tre <dig> gene can lead to moulting deformities and a high mortality rate through the regulation of gene expression in the chitin biosynthesis pathway and may be a potential approach for pest control in the future.
