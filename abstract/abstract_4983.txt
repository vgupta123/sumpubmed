BACKGROUND
from bacteria to eukarya, the specific recognition of the amino-acylated initiator trna by the universally conserved translational gtpase eif5b/if <dig> is one of the most central interactions in the process of translation initiation. however, the molecular details, particularly also in the context of ribosomal initiation complexes, are only partially understood.


RESULTS
a reinterpretation of the  <dig>  Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy  structure of the eukaryal 80s initiation complex using the recently published crystal structure of eif5b reveals that domain iv of eif5b forms extensive interaction interfaces with the met-trnai, which, in contrast to the previous model, directly involve the methionylated 3′ cca-end of the acceptor stem. these contacts are mediated by a conserved surface area, which is homologous to the surface areas mediating the interactions between if <dig> and fmet-trnafmet as well as between domain ii of ef-tu and amino-acylated elongator trnas.


CONCLUSIONS
the reported observations provide novel direct structural insight into the specific recognition of the methionylated acceptor stem by eif5b domain iv and demonstrate its universality among eif5b/if <dig> orthologs in the three domains of life.
