BACKGROUND
the transcriptional cofactor, hairless , acts as one of the key regulators of hair follicle cycling; the loss of function mutations is the cause of the expression of the hairless phenotype in humans and mice. recently, we reported a new hr mutant mouse called 'hairpoor' . these mutants harbor a gain of the function mutation, t403a, in the hr gene. this confers the overexpression of hr and hrhp is an animal model of marie unna hereditary hypotrichosis in humans. in the present study, the expression profile of hrhp/hrhp skin was investigated using microarray analysis to identify genes whose expression was affected by the overexpression of hr.


RESULTS
from  <dig>  mouse probes, differential expressions in  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> genes  in skin from hrhp/hrhp mice were discovered and compared with skin from wild-type mice. among the  <dig> genes with a >  <dig> -fold increase in expression, further analysis showed that the expression of eight genes known to have a close relationship with hair follicle development, ascertained by conducting real-time pcr on skin rna produced during hair follicle morphogenesis , indicated that four genes, wif <dig>  casp <dig>  krt <dig>  and sfrp <dig>  showed a consistent expression pattern with respect to hr overexpression in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
wif <dig> and casp <dig> were found to be upregulated, whereas krt <dig> and sfrp <dig> were downregulated in cells overexpressing hr in transient transfection experiments on keratinocytes, suggesting that hr may transcriptionally regulate these genes. further studies are required to understand the mechanism of this regulation by the hr cofactor.
