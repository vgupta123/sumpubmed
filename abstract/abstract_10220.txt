BACKGROUND
eukaryotic aldehyde dehydrogenases , which oxidize aldehydes into carboxylic acids, have been classified into more than  <dig> families. in mammals, family  <dig> aldhs detoxify acetaldehyde. it has been hypothesized that plant family  <dig> aldhs oxidize acetaldehyde generated via ethanolic fermentation, producing acetate for acetyl-coa biosynthesis via acetyl-coa synthetase , similar to the yeast pathway termed the "pyruvate dehydrogenase  bypass". evidence for this pathway in plants has been obtained from pollen.


RESULTS
to test for the presence of the pdh bypass in the sporophytic tissue of plants, arabidopsis plants homozygous for mutant alleles of all three family  <dig> aldh genes were fed with 14c-ethanol along with wild type controls. comparisons of the incorporation rates of 14c-ethanol into fatty acids in mutants and wild type controls provided direct evidence for the presence of the pdh bypass in sporophytic tissue. among the three family  <dig> aldhs, one of the two mitochondrial aldhs  appears to be the primary contributor to this pathway. surprisingly, single, double and triple aldh mutants of arabidopsis did not exhibit detectable phenotypes, even though a family  <dig> aldh gene is required for normal anther development in maize.


CONCLUSIONS
the pdh bypass is active in sporophytic tissue of plants. blocking this pathway via triple aldh mutants does not uncover obvious visible phenotypes.
