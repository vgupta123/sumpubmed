BACKGROUND
the rapid growth of protein interactome data has elevated the necessity and importance of network analysis tools. however, unlike pure text data, network search spaces are of exponential complexity. this poses special challenges for storing, searching, and navigating this data efficiently. moreover, development of effective web interfaces has been difficult.


RESULTS
we present integrator, a web-integrated graphical search tool for protein-protein interaction networks across 50+ genomes.


CONCLUSIONS
integrator provides single and multiple protein searches of the bioverse database containing experimentally-derived and predicted protein-protein interactions. the interface provides animated local network views, rapid subgraph manipulation, and cross-referencing of functional annotations. integrator is available at .
