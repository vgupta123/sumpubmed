BACKGROUND
mitochondria are a valuable resource for studying the evolutionary process and deducing phylogeny. a few mitochondria genomes have been sequenced, but a comprehensive picture of the domestication event for silkworm mitochondria remains to be established. in this study, we integrate the extant data, and perform a whole genome resequencing of japanese wild silkworm to obtain breakthrough results in silkworm mitochondrial  population, and finally use these to deduce a more comprehensive phylogeny of the bombycidae.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the mt genome, but found no past recombination event to have occurred in the silkworm progenitor. a phylogeny inferred from these whole genome snps resulted in a well-classified tree, confirming that the domesticated silkworm, bombyx mori, most recently diverged from the chinese wild silkworm, rather than from the japanese wild silkworm. we showed that the population sizes of the domesticated and chinese wild silkworms both experience neither expansion nor contraction. we also discovered that one mt gene, named cytochrome b, shows a strong signal of positive selection in the domesticated clade. this gene is related to energy metabolism, and may have played an important role during silkworm domestication.


CONCLUSIONS
we present a comparative analysis on  <dig> mt genomes of b. mori and b. mandarina from china and japan. with these, we obtain a much clearer picture of the evolution history of the silkworm. the data and analyses presented here aid our understanding of the silkworm in general, and provide a crucial insight into silkworm phylogeny.
