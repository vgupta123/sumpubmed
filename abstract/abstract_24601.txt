BACKGROUND
the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells is a complex process that involves epigenetic modifications and the interaction of dna with multiple transcription factors. this process can be studied with unprecedented sensitivity using a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and next-generation dna sequencing . available chip-seq data can be further utilized to interpret new gene expression profiling experiments.


RESULTS
here, we describe seqinspector, a tool that accepts any set of genomic coordinates from chip-seq or rna-seq studies to identify shared transcriptional regulators. the presented web resource includes a large collection of publicly available chip-seq and rna-seq experiments  performed on transcription factors, histone modifications, rna polymerases, enhancers and insulators in humans and mice. over-representation is calculated based on the coverage computed directly from indexed files storing chip-seq data . therefore, seqinspector is not limited to pre-computed sets of gene promoters.


CONCLUSIONS
the tool can be used to identify common gene expression regulators for sets of co-expressed transcripts  or for sets of chip-seq peaks to identify putative protein-protein interactions or transcriptional co-factors. the tool is available at http://seqinspector.cremag.org.
