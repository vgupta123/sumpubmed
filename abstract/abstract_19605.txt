BACKGROUND
relatively few laboratory markers have been evaluated for the detection or monitoring of intestinal inflammation in canine chronic enteropathies, including inflammatory bowel disease . previous research found that the intestinal mucosal levels of s100a <dig> and myeloperoxidase , as biomarkers of gut inflammation, were elevated in human patients with ibd. to date, the s100a <dig> and mpo levels in intestinal mucosal samples from either healthy dogs or from dogs suffering from ibd remain unreported. therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the mucosal s100a <dig> and mpo levels in four different parts of the intestine  in  <dig> healthy laboratory beagle dogs using the elisa and spectrophotometric methods, respectively.


RESULTS
based on histological examinations, the recorded findings for all the samples were considered normal. the mucosal concentration of s100a <dig> in the ileum was significantly higher than in all other segments of the intestine . mpo activity was significantly higher in the ileal, jejunal and duodenal than in colonic mucosal samples . moreover, its concentration was higher in the jejunum than in the duodenum.


CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that s100a <dig> and mpo are reliably detectable in canine intestinal mucosa. the assays used appeared to be sufficient to further evaluate the role of s100a <dig> and mpo in the pathogenesis of canine chronic enteropathies, including ibd. these biomarkers may play a role in the initial detection of gut inflammation suggesting the need for further investigations to confirm ibd or to differentiate between ibd subtypes. understanding the role of s100a <dig> and mpo in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation in future may result in an improved understanding of canine chronic intestinal inflammation.
