BACKGROUND
rhodosporidium toruloides is a β-carotenoid accumulating, oleaginous yeast that has great biotechnological potential. the lack of reliable and efficient genetic manipulation tools have been a major hurdle blocking its adoption as a biotechnology platform.


RESULTS
we report for the first time the development of a highly efficient targeted gene deletion method in r. toruloides atcc  <dig> via agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. to further improve targeting frequency, the ku <dig> and ku <dig> homologs in r. toruloides were isolated and characterized in detail. a ku70-deficient mutant  generated with the hygromycin selection cassette removed by the cre-loxp recombination system showed a dramatically improved targeted gene deletion frequency, with over 90% of the transformants being true knockouts when homology sequence length of at least 1 kb was used. successful gene targeting could be made with homologous flanking sequences as short as 100 bp in the ∆ku70e strain. ku <dig> deficiency did not perturb cell growth although an elevated sensitivity to dna mutagenic agents was observed. compared to the other well-known oleaginous yeast, yarrowia lipolytica, r. toruloides ku70/ku <dig> genes contain much higher density of introns and are the most gc-rich ku70/ku <dig> genes reported.


CONCLUSIONS
the ku70-deficient mutant generated herein was effective in improving gene deletion frequency and allowed shorter homology sequences to be used for gene targeting. it retained the key oleaginous and fast growing features of r. toruloides. the strain should facilitate both fundamental and applied studies in this important yeast, with the approaches taken here likely to be applicable in other species in subphylum pucciniomycotina.
