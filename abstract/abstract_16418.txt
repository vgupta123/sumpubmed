BACKGROUND
connectivity mapping is a process to recognize novel pharmacological and toxicological properties in small molecules by comparing their gene expression signatures with others in a database. a simple and robust method for connectivity mapping with increased specificity and sensitivity was recently developed, and its utility demonstrated using experimentally derived gene signatures.


RESULTS
this paper introduces sscmap , a java application designed to undertake connectivity mapping tasks using the recently published method. the software is bundled with a default collection of reference gene-expression profiles based on the publicly available dataset from the broad institute connectivity map  <dig>  which includes data from over  <dig> affymetrix microarrays, for over  <dig> small-molecule compounds, and  <dig> treatment instances in  <dig> human cell lines. in addition, the application allows users to add their custom collections of reference profiles and is applicable to a wide range of other 'omics technologies.


CONCLUSIONS
the utility of sscmap is two fold. first, it serves to make statistically significant connections between a user-supplied gene signature and the  <dig> core reference profiles based on the broad institute expanded dataset. second, it allows users to apply the same improved method to custom-built reference profiles which can be added to the database for future referencing. the software can be freely downloaded from .
