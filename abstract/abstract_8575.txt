BACKGROUND
phosphomannomutase  is an essential enzyme in eukaryotes. however, little is known about pmm gene and function in crop plants. here, we report molecular evolutionary and biochemical analysis of pmm genes in bread wheat and related triticeae species.


RESULTS
two sets of homoeologous pmm genes  were found in bread wheat, and two corresponding pmm genes were identified in the diploid progenitors of bread wheat and many other diploid triticeae species. the duplication event yielding pmm- <dig> and  <dig> occurred before the radiation of diploid triticeae genomes. the pmm gene family in wheat and relatives may evolve largely under purifying selection. among the six tapmm genes, the transcript levels of pmm- <dig> members were comparatively high and their recombinant proteins were all enzymatically active. however, pmm- <dig> homoeologs exhibited lower transcript levels, two of which were also inactive. tapmm-a <dig>  b <dig> and d <dig> were probably the main active isozymes in bread wheat tissues. the three isozymes differed from their counterparts in barley and brachypodium distachyon in being more tolerant to elevated test temperatures.


CONCLUSIONS
our work identified the genes encoding pmm isozymes in bread wheat and relatives, uncovered a unique pmm duplication event in diverse triticeae species, and revealed the main active pmm isozymes in bread wheat tissues. the knowledge obtained here improves the understanding of pmm evolution in eukaryotic organisms, and may facilitate further investigations of pmm function in the temperature adaptability of bread wheat.
