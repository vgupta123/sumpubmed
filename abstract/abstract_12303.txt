BACKGROUND
the complexity of biological data related to the genetic origins of tumour cells, originates significant challenges to glean valuable knowledge that can be used to predict therapeutic responses. in order to discover a link between gene expression profiles and drug responses, a computational framework based on consensus p-median clustering is proposed. the main goal is to simultaneously predict  anticancer responses by extracting common patterns among tumour cell lines, selecting genes that could potentially explain the therapy outcome and finally learning a probabilistic model able to predict the therapeutic responses.


RESULTS
the experimental investigation performed on the nci <dig> dataset highlights three main findings:  consensus p-median is able to create groups of cell lines that are highly correlated both in terms of gene expression and drug response;  from a biological point of view, the proposed approach enables the selection of genes that are strongly involved in several cancer processes;  the final prediction of drug responses, built upon consensus p-median and the selected genes, represents a promising step for predicting potential useful drugs.


CONCLUSIONS
the proposed learning framework represents a promising approach predicting drug response in tumour cells.
