BACKGROUND
tumour associated antigens on the surface of tumour cells, such as muc <dig>  are being used as specific antibody targets for immunotherapy of human malignancies. in order to address the poor penetration of full sized monoclonal antibodies in tumours, intermediate sized antibodies are being developed. the cost-effective and efficient production of these molecules is however crucial for their further success as anti-cancer therapeutics. the methylotropic p. pastoris yeast grows in cheap mineral media and is known for its short process times and the efficient production of recombinant antibody fragments like scfvs, bivalent scfvs and fabs.


RESULTS
based on the anti-muc <dig> ph <dig> fab, we have developed bivalent ph <dig> bibodies and trivalent ph <dig> tribodies of intermediate molecular mass by adding ph <dig> scfvs to the c-terminus of the fab chains using flexible peptide linkers. these recombinant antibody derivatives were efficiently expressed in both mammalian and p. pastoris cells. stable production in ns <dig> cells produced  <dig>  mg pure bibody and  <dig> mg pure tribody per litre. this high yield is achieved as a result of the high overall purification efficiency of 77%. expression and purification of ph <dig> bibodies and tribodies from pichia supernatant yielded predominantly correctly heterodimerised products, free of light chain homodimers. the yeast-produced bi- and tribodies retained the same specific activity as their mammalian-produced counterparts. additionally, the yields of  <dig>  mg pure bibody and  <dig> mg pure tribody per litre supernatant make the production of these molecules in pichia more efficient than most other previously described trispecific or trivalent molecules produced in e. coli.


CONCLUSIONS
bi- and tribody molecules are efficiently produced in p. pastoris. furthermore, the yeast produced molecules retain the same specific affinity for their antigen. these results establish the value of p. pastoris as an efficient alternative expression system for the production of recombinant multivalent fab-scfv antibody derivatives.
