BACKGROUND
antimicrobial resistance is under-documented and commensal escherichia coli can be used as indicator organisms to study the resistance in the community. we sought to determine the prevalence of resistance to broad-spectrum antimicrobials with particular focus on the quinolones, which have recently been introduced in parts of africa, including ghana.


RESULTS
forty  of  <dig> e. coli isolates evaluated were nalidixic acid-resistant. thirteen  of  <dig> and  <dig> isolates and  <dig>  of  <dig> isolates were also resistant to ciprofloxacin. all but one of the quinolone-resistant isolates were resistant to three or more other antimicrobial classes. sequencing the quinolone-resistance determining regions of gyra and parc, which encode quinolone targets, revealed that  <dig> quinolone-resistant e. coli harboured a substitution at position  <dig> of the gyra gene product and  <dig> of these isolates had other gyra and/or parc substitutions. horizontally-acquired quinolone-resistance genes qnrb <dig>  qnrb <dig>  qnrs <dig> or qepa were detected in  <dig> of the isolates. in spite of considerable overall diversity among e. coli from ghana, as evaluated by multilocus sequence typing,  <dig> quinolone-resistant e. coli belonged to sequence type complex  <dig>  five of these isolates carried qnrs <dig> alleles.


CONCLUSIONS
quinolone-resistant e. coli are commonly present in the faecal flora of accra residents. the isolates have evolved resistance through multiple mechanisms and belong to very few lineages, suggesting clonal expansion. containment strategies to limit the spread of quinolone-resistant e. coli need to be deployed to conserve quinolone effectiveness and promote alternatives to their use.
