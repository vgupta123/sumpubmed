BACKGROUND
nasal carriers not only pose serious threat to themselves but also to the community by playing an active role in the dissemination of serious and life threatening s. aureus especially mrsa strains. the present study focuses on the use of broad spectrum lytic phage as decolonising agent. in addition, the combined use of lytic phage with mupirocin has also been investigated as an effective decolonising regimen. the effect of phage on the adherence, invasion and cytotoxic effect of mrsa strains on nasal epithelial cells was studied in an ex-vivo model of cultured murine nasal epithelial cells. this was followed by demonstration of therapeutic potential of phage along with mupirocin in decolonising the nares of balb/c mice using a nasal model of mrsa colonisation.


RESULTS
phage was able to significantly reduce the in vitro adherence, invasion and cytotoxicity of mrsa  <dig> as well as other clinical mrsa strains on murine nasal epithelial cells as compared to untreated control. also, the frequency of emergence of spontaneous mutants decreased to negligible levels when both the agents  were used together.


CONCLUSIONS
phage mr- <dig>  given along with mupirocin showed an additive effect and the combination was able to effectively eradicate the colonising mrsa population from the nares of mice by day  <dig>
