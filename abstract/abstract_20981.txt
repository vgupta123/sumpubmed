BACKGROUND
genome integrity is constantly challenged and requires the coordinated recruitment of multiple enzyme activities to ensure efficient repair of dna lesions. we investigated the dynamics of xrcc <dig> and pcna that act as molecular loading platforms and play a central role in this coordination.


RESULTS
local dna damage was introduced by laser microirradation and the recruitment of fluorescent xrcc <dig> and pcna fusion proteins was monitored by live cell microscopy. we found an immediate and fast recruitment of xrcc <dig> preceding the slow and continuous recruitment of pcna. fluorescence bleaching experiments  revealed a stable association of pcna with dna repair sites, contrasting the high turnover of xrcc <dig>  when cells were repeatedly challenged with multiple dna lesions we observed a gradual depletion of the nuclear pool of pcna, while xrcc <dig> dynamically redistributed even to lesions inflicted last.


CONCLUSIONS
these results show that pcna and xrcc <dig> have distinct kinetic properties with functional consequences for their capacity to respond to successive dna damage events.
