BACKGROUND
cultivated rice consists of two important ecotypes, upland and irrigated, that have respectively adapted to either dry land or irrigated cultivation. upland rice, widely adopted in rainfed upland areas in virtue of its little water requirement, contains abundant untapped genetic resources, such as genes for drought adaptation. with water shortage exacerbated and population expanding, the need for breeding crop varieties with drought adaptation becomes more and more urgent. however, a previous oversight in upland rice research reveals little information regarding its genetic mechanisms for upland adaption, greatly hindering progress in harnessing its genetic resources for breeding and cultivation.


RESULTS
in this study, we selected  <dig> upland and  <dig> irrigated accessions from all over the world, phenotyped them under both irrigated and dry land environments, and investigated the phylogenetic relations and population structure of the upland ecotype using whole genome variation data. further comparative analysis yields a list of differentiated genes that may account for the phenotypic and physiological differences between upland and irrigated rice.


CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the first genomic investigation in a large sample of upland rice, providing valuable gene list for understanding upland rice adaptation, especially drought-related adaptation, and its subsequent utilization in modern agriculture.
