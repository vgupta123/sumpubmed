BACKGROUND
autophagy is a self-catabolic mechanism that degrades unnecessary cellular components through lysosomal enzymes. beclin- <dig>  an autophagy-related protein, establishes the first connection between autophagy and tumorigenesis. the purpose of this study is to assess the beclin- <dig> expression pattern and to determine its prognostic significance in patients with malignant canine mammary tumor .


RESULTS
we examined beclin- <dig> expression in  <dig> cases of malignant cmts by immunohistochemistry. cytoplasmic beclin- <dig> expression was significantly weaker in cancer cells than in nearby normal mammary glands . low cytoplasmic expression  was associated with older age, lower degree of tubular formation, increased mitotic activity, higher histologic grade, and extensive necrosis. low nuclear expression  was connected with older age, lower degree of tubular formation, extensive necrosis, and negative for her2/neu overexpression. univariate survival analysis showed that beclin- <dig> cytoplasmic expression was a poor prognostic factor for overall survival rate . multivariate survival analysis demonstrated that beclin- <dig> cytoplasmic expression is an independent prognostic factor .


CONCLUSIONS
loss of beclin- <dig> is associated with aggressive clinicopathologic features and poor overall survival. the results suggest that beclin- <dig> plays an important role in tumor progression of malignant cmts.
