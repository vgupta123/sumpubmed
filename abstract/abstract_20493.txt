BACKGROUND
genetic mapping and qtl detection are powerful methodologies in plant improvement and breeding. construction of a high-density and high-quality genetic map would be of great benefit in the production of superior grapes to meet human demand. high throughput and low cost of the recently developed next generation sequencing  technology have resulted in its wide application in genome research. sequencing restriction-site associated dna  might be an efficient strategy to simplify genotyping. combining ngs with rad has proven to be powerful for single nucleotide polymorphism  marker development.


RESULTS
an f <dig> population of  <dig> individual plants was developed. in-silico digestion-site prediction was used to select an appropriate restriction enzyme for construction of a rad sequencing library. next generation rad sequencing was applied to genotype the f <dig> population and its parents. applying a cluster strategy for snp modulation, a total of  <dig>  high-quality snp markers were developed:  <dig>  of these were mapped to the female genetic map,  <dig> to the male map, and  <dig>  to the integrated map. a comparison of the genetic maps to the published vitis vinifera genome revealed both conservation and variations.


CONCLUSIONS
the applicability of next generation rad sequencing for genotyping a grape f <dig> population was demonstrated, leading to the successful development of a genetic map with high density and quality using our designed snp markers. detailed analysis revealed that this newly developed genetic map can be used for a variety of genome investigations, such as qtl detection, sequence assembly and genome comparison.
