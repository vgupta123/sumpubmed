BACKGROUND
mob family proteins are conserved between animals, plants and fungi and are essential for the activation of ndr kinases that control crucial cellular processes like cytokinesis, proliferation and morphology.


RESULTS
we identified a hypomorphic allele of chmob <dig> in a random insertional mutant  of the hemibiotrophic ascomycete fungus colletotrichum higginsianum. the mutant is impaired in conidiation, host penetration and virulence on arabidopsis thaliana. chmob <dig> binds to and co-localizes with the ndr/lats kinase homolog chcbk <dig>  mutants in the two potential chcbk <dig> downstream targets chssd <dig> and chace <dig> show defects in pathogenicity. the genome of c. higginsianum encodes two more mob proteins. while we could not detect any effect on pathogenicity in Δchmob <dig> mutants, chmob <dig> is involved in conidiation, septae formation and virulence.


CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that chmob <dig> binds to the conserved ndr/lats kinase chcbk <dig> and plays an important role in pathogenicity of colletotrichum higginsianum on arabidopsis thaliana.
