BACKGROUND
previous reports of site-directed deletion analysis on gamma -phage lysin protein  have demonstrated that removal of a short amino acid sequence in the c-terminal region encompassing a 10-amino acid motif  abrogates its binding activity specific to the cell wall of bacillus anthracis. whether short synthetic peptides representing the10-amino acid plyg putative binding motif flanked by surrounding n- and c-terminal residues also selectively bind to the bacterial cell wall has not been evaluated. if such peptides do demonstrate selective binding to the cell wall, they could serve as bio-probes towards developing detection technologies for b. anthracis. furthermore, by using b. anthracis , an animal vaccine and b. cereus- <dig>  a Î³-phage susceptible rare strain as surrogates of b. anthracis, development of proof-of-concepts for b. anthracis are feasible.


RESULTS
using four different methods, we evaluated six synthetic peptides representing the putative binding motif including flanking sequences  for the bacterial cell wall binding capacity. our analysis identified plyg-p <dig>  plyg-p <dig> and plyg-p <dig> to have binding capability to both b. anthracis  and b. cereus- <dig>  the peptides however did not bind to b. cereus- <dig>  b. thuringiensis, and b. cereus- <dig> suggesting their specificity for b. anthracis-sterne and b. cereus- <dig>  plyg-p <dig> in combination with fluorescent light microscopy detected even a single bacterium in plasma spiked with the bacteria.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, these studies illustrate that the short 10-amino acid sequence 'lkmtadfilq' in fact is a stand-alone bacterial cell wall-binding motif of plyg. in principle, synthetic peptides plyg-p <dig>  plyg-p <dig> and plyg-p <dig>  especially plyg-p <dig> coupled with qdot-nanocrystals are useful as high-sensitivity bio-probes in developing detection technologies for b. anthracis.
