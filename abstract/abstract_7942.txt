BACKGROUND
notch signaling drives developmental processes in all metazoans. the receptor binding region of the human notch ligand jagged- <dig> is made of a dsl  domain and two atypical epidermal growth factor  repeats encoded by two exons, exon  <dig> and  <dig>  which are out of phase with respect to the egf domain boundaries.


RESULTS
we determined the 1h-nmr solution structure of the polypeptide encoded by exon  <dig> of jag <dig> and spanning the c-terminal region of egf <dig> and the entire egf <dig>  we show that this single, evolutionary conserved exon defines an autonomous structural unit that, despite the minimal structural context, closely matches the structure of the same region in the entire receptor binding module.


CONCLUSIONS
in eukaryotic genomes, exon and domain boundaries usually coincide. we report a case study where this assertion does not hold, and show that the autonomously folding, structural unit is delimited by exon boundaries, rather than by predicted domain boundaries.
