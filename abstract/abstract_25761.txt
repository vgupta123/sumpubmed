BACKGROUND
previous studies found that rats subjected to carrageenan injection develop hyperalgesia, and despite complete recovery in several days, they continue to have an enhanced hyperalgesic response to a new noxious challenge for more than 28d. the study's aim was to identify candidate genes that have a role in the formation of the long-term hyperalgesia-related imprint in the spinal cord. this objective was undertaken with the understanding that the long-lasting imprint of acute pain in the central nervous system may contribute to the transition of acute pain to chronicity.


RESULTS
to analyze changes in gene expression when carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia has disappeared but propensity for the enhanced hyperalgesic response is still present, we determined the gene expression profile using oligo microarray in the lumbar part of the spinal cord in three groups of rats: 28d after carrageenan injection, 24h after injection , and with no injection . out of  <dig>  annotated genes,  <dig> were found to be differentially expressed compared with the control group at 28d, and  <dig> at 24h after carrageenan injection . among differentially expressed genes,  <dig>  were identified as being part of pain-related pathways, altered in different models of pain, or interacting with proteins involved in pain-related pathways. using gene ontology  classification, we have identified  <dig> functional classes deserving attention for possible association with pain memory: they are related to cell-to-cell interaction, synaptogenesis, and neurogenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
despite recovery from inflammatory hyperalgesia, persistent changes in spinal cord gene expression may underlie the propensity for the enhanced hyperalgesic response. we suggest that lasting changes in expression of genes involved in the formation of new synapses and neurogenesis may contribute to the transition of acute pain to chronicity.
