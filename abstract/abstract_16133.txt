BACKGROUND
ribosomal dna of several species of the free-living naegleria amoeba harbors an optional group i intron within the nuclear small subunit ribosomal rna gene. the intron  has a complex organization of two ribozyme domains  and a homing endonuclease gene . nagir <dig> is responsible for intron excision, exon ligation, and full-length intron rna circularization, reactions typical for nuclear group i intron ribozymes. nagir <dig>  however, is essential for naheg expression by generating the 5' end of the homing endonuclease messenger rna. interestingly, this unusual class of ribozyme adds a lariat-cap at the mrna.


RESULTS
to elucidate the evolutionary history of the nae.s <dig> twin-ribozyme introns we have analyzed  <dig> natural variants present in distinct naegleria isolates. structural variabilities were noted within both the ribozyme domains and provide strong comparative support to the intron secondary structure. one of the introns, present in n. martinezi ng <dig>  contains hallmarks of a degenerated naheg. phylogenetic analyses performed on separate data sets representing nagir <dig>  nagir <dig>  naheg, and its1- <dig> s-its <dig> ribosomal dna are consistent with an overall vertical inheritance pattern of the intron within the naegleria genus.


CONCLUSIONS
the nae.s <dig> twin-ribozyme intron was gained early in the naegleria evolution with subsequent vertical inheritance. the intron was lost in the majority of isolates , leaving a widespread but scattered distribution pattern. why the apparent asexual naegleria amoebae harbors active intron homing endonucleases, dependent on sexual reproduction for its function, remains a puzzle.
