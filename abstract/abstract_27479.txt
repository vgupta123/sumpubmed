BACKGROUND
bacteria integrate numerous environmental stimuli when generating cellular responses. increasing numbers of examples describe how one two-component system  responds to signals detected by the sensor of another tcs. however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly defined.


RESULTS
here, we report a connector-like factor that affects the activity of the cpxr/cpxa two-component system in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. we isolated a clone that induced the expression of a cpxp-lac gene fusion from a high-copy-number plasmid pool of random salmonella genomic fragments. a 63-amino acid protein, caca, was responsible for the cpxa/cpxr-dependent activation of the cpxp gene. the cpxr-activated genes cpxp and spy exhibited approximately 30% and 50% reductions in transcription, respectively, in a clean caca deletion mutant strain in comparison to wild-type. from  <dig> response regulator  deletion mutants, we identified that the rssb regulator represses caca transcription. substitution mutations in a conserved - <dig> region harboring the rna polymerase recognition sequence, which is well conserved with a known rpos - <dig> region consensus sequence, rendered the caca promoter rpos-independent. the caca-mediated induction of cpxp transcription was affected in a trxa deletion mutant, which encodes thioredoxin  <dig>  suggesting a role for cysteine thiol-disulfide exchange in caca-dependent cpx activation.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified caca as an activator of the cpxr/cpxa system in the plasmid clone. we propose that caca may integrate the regulatory status of rssb/rpos into the cpxr/cpxa system. future investigations are necessary to thoroughly elucidate how caca activates the cpxr/cpxa system.
