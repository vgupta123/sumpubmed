BACKGROUND
in order to confirm the roles of creatine  in epilepsy, we investigated the anti-convulsive effects of cr, creatine transporter  and creatine kinases  against chemical-induced acute seizure activity and chronic epileptic seizure activity.


RESULTS
two hr after pilocarpine -seizure induction, ubiquitous mitochondrial ck  immunoreactivity was unaltered as compared to control level. however, brain-type cytoplasm ck  immunoreactivity was decreased to 70% of control level. crt immunoreactivity was decreased to 60% of control level. following cr or tat-ck treatment, umtck or crt immunoreactivity was unaffected, while bck immunoreactivity in cr treated group was increased to  <dig> -fold of control levels. Î²-guanidinopropionic acid  reduced bck and crt expression. in addition, cr and tat-bck treatment delayed the beginning of seizure activity after pilo injection. however, gpa treatment induced spontaneous seizure activity without pilo treatment. in chronic epilepsy rats, both umtck and crt immunoreactivities were reduced in the hippocampus. in contrast, bck immunoreactivity was similar to that observed in control animals. cr-, gpa and tat-bck treatment could not change eeg.


CONCLUSIONS
cr/ck circuit may play an important role in sustaining or exacerbating acute seizure activity, but not chronic epileptic discharge.
