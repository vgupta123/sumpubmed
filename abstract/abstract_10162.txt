BACKGROUND
hydrocephalus in friesian horses is a developmental disorder that often results in stillbirth of affected foals and dystocia in dams. the occurrence is probably related to a founder effect and inbreeding in the population. the aim of our study was to find genomic associations, to investigate the mode of inheritance, to allow a dna test for hydrocephalus in friesian horses to be developed. in case of a monogenic inheritance we aimed to identify the causal mutation.


RESULTS
a genome-wide association study of hydrocephalus in  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls using  <dig>  snps indicated the involvement of a region on eca <dig> . next generation dna sequence analysis of  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls of gene exons within the region revealed a mutation in β- <dig> -n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase  <dig>  as the likely cause of hydrocephalus in friesian horses. the nonsense mutation xm_ <dig> c.1423c>t corresponding to xp_ <dig> p.gln475* was identical to a b3galnt <dig> mutation identified in a human case of muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy with hydrocephalus. all  <dig> available cases and none of the controls were homozygous for the mutation, and all  <dig> obligate carriers  were heterozygous. a random sample of the friesian horse population  was tested for the mutation in a commercial laboratory. one-hundred and forty-seven horses were carrier and  <dig> horses were homozygous for the normal allele; the estimated allele frequency in the friesian horse population is  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
hydrocephalus in friesian horses has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. a nonsense mutation xm_ <dig> c.1423c>t corresponding to xp_ <dig> p.gln475* in b3galnt <dig>  is concordant with hydrocephalus in friesian horses. application of a dna test in the breeding programme will reduce the losses caused by hydrocephalus in the friesian horse population.
