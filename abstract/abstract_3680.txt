BACKGROUND
gamma-aminobutyric acid type a receptors  are the major inhibitory receptors in the mammalian brain and are modulated by a number of sedative/hypnotic drugs including benzodiazepines and anesthetics. the significance of specific gabaa-rs subunits with respect to behavior and in vivo drug responses is incompletely understood. the γ <dig> subunit is highly expressed throughout the brain. global γ <dig> knockout mice are insensitive to the hypnotic effects of diazepam and die perinatally. heterozygous γ <dig> global knockout mice are viable and have increased anxiety-like behaviors. to further investigate the role of the γ <dig> subunit in behavior and whole animal drug action, we used gene targeting to create a novel mouse line with attenuated γ <dig> expression, i.e., γ <dig> knockdown mice.


RESULTS
knockdown mice were created by inserting a neomycin resistance cassette into intron  <dig> of the γ <dig> gene. knockdown mice, on average, showed a 65% reduction of γ <dig> subunit mrna compared to controls; however γ <dig> gene expression was highly variable in these mice, ranging from 10–95% of normal. immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that γ <dig> protein levels were also variably reduced. pharmacological studies using autoradiography on frozen brain sections demonstrated that binding of the benzodiazepine site ligand ro15- <dig> was decreased in mutant mice compared to controls. behaviorally, knockdown mice displayed enhanced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus maze and forced novelty exploration tests. surprisingly, mutant mice had an unaltered response to hypnotic doses of the benzodiazepine site ligands diazepam, midazolam and zolpidem as well as ethanol and pentobarbital. lastly, we demonstrated that the γ <dig> knockdown mouse line can be used to create γ <dig> global knockout mice by crossing to a general deleter cre-expressing mouse line.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that: 1) insertion of a neomycin resistance gene into intron  <dig> of the γ <dig> gene variably reduced the amount of γ <dig>  and that 2) attenuated expression of γ <dig> increased anxiety-like behaviors but did not lead to differences in the hypnotic response to benzodiazepine site ligands. this suggests that reduced synaptic inhibition can lead to a phenotype of increased anxiety-like behavior. in contrast, normal drug effects can be maintained despite a dramatic reduction in gabaa-r targets.
