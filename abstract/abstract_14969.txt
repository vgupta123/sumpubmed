BACKGROUND
the bacterial species xanthomonas campestris infects a wide range of brassicaceae. specific pathovars of this species cause black rot , bacterial blight of stock  or bacterial leaf spot .


RESULTS
in this study, we extended the genomic coverage of the species by sequencing and annotating the genomes of strains from pathovar incanae , pathovar raphani  and a pathovar formerly named barbareae . while comparative analyses identified a large core orfeome at the species level, the core type iii effectome was limited to only three putative type iii effectors . in xanthomonas, these effector proteins are injected inside the plant cells by the type iii secretion system and contribute collectively to virulence. a deep and strand-specific rna sequencing strategy was adopted in order to experimentally refine genome annotation for strain cfbp 5828r. this approach also allowed the experimental definition of novel orfs and non-coding rna transcripts. using a constitutively active allele of hrpg, a master regulator of the type iii secretion system, a hrpg-dependent regulon of  <dig> genes co-regulated with the type iii secretion system was identified. importantly, all these genes but seven are positively regulated by hrpg and  <dig> of those encode components of the hrp type iii secretion system and putative effector proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
this dataset is an important resource to mine for novel type iii effector proteins as well as for bacterial genes which could contribute to pathogenicity of x. campestris.
