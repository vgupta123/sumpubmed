BACKGROUND
 gene co-expression network analysis  is widely adopted in bioinformatics and biomedical research with applications such as gene function prediction, protein-protein interaction inference, disease markers identification, and copy number variance discovery. currently there is a lack of rigorous analysis on the mathematical condition for which the co-expressed gene module should satisfy.

methods
in this paper, we present a linear algebraic based centralized concordance index  for evaluating the concordance of co-expressed gene modules from gene co-expression network analysis. the cci can be used to evaluate the performance for co-expression network analysis algorithms as well as for detecting condition specific co-expression modules. we applied cci in detecting lung tumor specific gene modules.

results and discussion
simulation showed that cci is a robust indicator for evaluating the concordance of a group of co-expressed genes. the application to lung cancer datasets revealed interesting potential tumor specific genetic alterations including cnvs and even hints for gene-fusion. deeper analysis required for understanding the molecular mechanisms of all such condition specific co-expression relationships.

conclusion
the cci can be used to evaluate the performance for co-expression network analysis algorithms as well as for detecting condition specific co-expression modules. it is shown to be more robust to outliers and interfering modules than density based on pearson correlation coefficients.
