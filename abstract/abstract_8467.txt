BACKGROUND
the development of linkage disequilibrium  maps and the characterization of haplotype block structure at the population level are useful parameters for guiding genome wide association  studies, and for understanding the nature of non-linear association between phenotypes and genes. the elucidation of haplotype block structure can reduce the information of several single nucleotide polymorphisms  into the information of a haplotype block, reducing the number of snps in a coherent way for consideration in gwa and genomic selection studies.


RESULTS
the maximum average ld, measured by r <dig> varied between  <dig>  to  <dig>  at a distance of <  <dig>  kb, and the minimum average values of r <dig> varied between  <dig>  to  <dig>  at distances ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kb, clearly showing that the average r <dig> reduced with the increase in snp pair distances. the persistence of ld phase showed higher values at shorter genomic distances, decreasing with the increase in physical distance, varying from  <dig>  at a distance of <  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  at a distance from  <dig> to  <dig> kb. a total of 78% of all snps were clustered into haplotype blocks, covering  <dig>  mb of the total autosomal genome size.


CONCLUSIONS
this study presented the first high density linkage disequilibrium map and haplotype block structure for a composite beef cattle population, and indicates that the high density snp panel over  <dig> k can be used for genomic selection implementation and gwa studies for canchim beef cattle.
