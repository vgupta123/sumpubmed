BACKGROUND
linkage maps are useful tools for examining both the genetic architecture of quantitative traits and the evolution of reproductive incompatibilities. we describe the generation of two genetic maps using reciprocal interspecific backcross  <dig>  mapping populations from crosses between iris brevicaulis and iris fulva. these maps were constructed using expressed sequence tag - derived codominant microsatellite markers. such a codominant marker system allowed for the ability to link the two reciprocal maps, and compare patterns of transmission ratio distortion observed between the two.


RESULTS
linkage mapping resulted in markers that coalesced into  <dig> linkage groups for each of the reciprocal backcross maps, presumably corresponding to the  <dig> haploid chromosomes of i. brevicaulis and i. fulva. the composite map was  <dig> -cm long, spanned 81% of the i. brevicaulis and i. fulva genomes, and had a mean density of  <dig>  cm per locus. transmission ratio distortion  was observed in  <dig>  loci distributed in  <dig> of the  <dig> lgs in bcib, bcif, or both bc <dig> mapping populations. of the distorted markers identified, i. fulva alleles were detected at consistently higher-than-expected frequencies in both mapping populations.


CONCLUSIONS
the observation that i. fulva alleles are overrepresented in both mapping populations suggests that i. fulva alleles are favored to introgress into i. brevicaulis genetic backgrounds, while i. brevicaulis alleles would tend to be prevented from introgressing into i. fulva. these data are consistent with the previously observed patterns of introgression in natural hybrid zones, where i. fulva alleles have been consistently shown to introgress across species boundaries.
