BACKGROUND
vertebrate alpha - and beta -globin gene families exemplify the way in which genomes evolve to produce functional complexity. from tandem duplication of a single globin locus, the α- and β-globin clusters expanded, and then were separated onto different chromosomes. the previous finding of a fossil β-globin gene  in the marsupial α-cluster, however, suggested that duplication of the α-β cluster onto two chromosomes, followed by lineage-specific gene loss and duplication, produced paralogous α- and β-globin clusters in birds and mammals. here we analyse genomic data from an egg-laying monotreme mammal, the platypus , to explore haemoglobin evolution at the stem of the mammalian radiation.


RESULTS
the platypus α-globin cluster  contains embryonic and adult α- globin genes, a β-like ω-globin gene, and the gby globin gene with homology to cytoglobin, arranged as 5'-ζ-ζ'-αd-α3-α2-α1-ω-gby-3'. the platypus β-globin cluster  contains single embryonic and adult globin genes arranged as 5'-ε-β-3'. surprisingly, all of these globin genes were expressed in some adult tissues. comparison of flanking sequences revealed that all jawed vertebrate α-globin clusters are flanked by mpg-c16orf <dig> and luc7l, whereas all bird and mammal β-globin clusters are embedded in olfactory genes. thus, the mammalian α- and β-globin clusters are orthologous to the bird α- and β-globin clusters respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that α- and β-globin clusters evolved from an ancient mpg-c16orf35-α-β-gby-luc7l arrangement  <dig> million years ago. a copy of the original β  was inserted into an array of olfactory genes before the amniote radiation , then duplicated and diverged to form orthologous clusters of β-globin genes with different expression profiles in different lineages.
