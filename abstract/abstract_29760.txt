BACKGROUND
plants of the huperziaceae family, which comprise the two genera huperzia and phlegmariurus, produce various types of lycopodium alkaloids that are used to treat a number of human ailments, such as contusions, swellings and strains. huperzine a, which belongs to the lycodine type of lycopodium alkaloids, has been used as an anti-alzheimer's disease drug candidate. despite their medical importance, little genomic or transcriptomic data are available for the members of this family. we used massive parallel pyrosequencing on the roche 454-gs flx titanium platform to generate a substantial est dataset for huperzia serrata  and phlegmariurus carinatus  as representative members of the huperzia and phlegmariurus genera, respectively. h. serrata and p. carinatus are important plants for research on the biosynthesis of lycopodium alkaloids. we focused on gene discovery in the areas of bioactive compound biosynthesis and transcriptional regulation as well as genetic marker detection in these species.


RESULTS
for h. serrata,  <dig>  unique putative transcripts were generated from  <dig>  reads totaling over  <dig> , <dig> base pairs; for p. carinatus,  <dig>  unique putative transcripts were generated from  <dig>  reads totaling over  <dig> , <dig> base pairs. using blastx searches of public databases,  <dig>   unique putative transcripts from h. serrata and  <dig>   from p. carinatus were assigned to at least one protein. gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  orthology annotations revealed that the functions of the unique putative transcripts from these two species cover a similarly broad set of molecular functions, biological processes and biochemical pathways.

in particular, a total of  <dig> h. serrata candidate cytochrome p <dig> genes, which are more abundant in leaves than in roots and might be involved in lycopodium alkaloid biosynthesis, were found based on the comparison of h. serrata and p. carinatus 454-ests and real-time pcr analysis. four unique putative cyp <dig> transcripts  which are the most likely to be involved in the biosynthesis of lycopodium alkaloids were selected based on a phylogenetic analysis. approximately  <dig> h. serrata and  <dig> p. carinatus unique putative transcripts associated with the biosynthesis of triterpenoids, alkaloids and flavones/flavonoids were located in the 454-est datasets. transcripts related to phytohormone biosynthesis and signal transduction as well as transcription factors were also obtained. in addition, we discovered  <dig>  and  <dig>  potential ssr-motif microsatellite loci in the h. serrata and p. carinatus 454-ests, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the 454-est resource allowed for the first large-scale acquisition of ests from h. serrata and p. carinatus, which are representative members of the huperziaceae family. we discovered many genes likely to be involved in the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds and transcriptional regulation as well as a large number of potential microsatellite markers. these results constitute an essential resource for understanding the molecular basis of developmental regulation and secondary metabolite biosynthesis  in the huperziaceae, and they provide an overview of the genetic diversity of this family.
