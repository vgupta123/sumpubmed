BACKGROUND
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  is characterized by selective degeneration of motor neurons. the gene encoding cu/zn superoxide dismutase  is responsible for 20% of familial als cases. growth hormone  concentrations are low in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with als; however, its association with motoneuronal death is not known. we tested the neuroprotective effects of gh on human sod-1-expressing cultured motor neurons and sod1g93a transgenic mice.


RESULTS
in cultured motor neurons, cytotoxicity was induced by a <dig>  gnso, or homocysteine, and the effects of gh were determined by mtt, bax, parp cleavage pattern, hoechst nuclear staining, mapk, and pi3k assay. in sod- <dig> transgenic mice, rotarod motor performance was evaluated. survival analysis of motoneuronal loss was done using cresyl violet, gfap, and bcl- <dig> staining. gh prevents motorneuronal death caused by gsno and homocysteine, but not that by a <dig>  it activates mapk and pi3k. gh-treated mice showed prolonged survival with improved motor performance and weight loss. gh decreased cresyl violet positive motoneuronal loss with strong bcl- <dig> and less gfap immunoreactivity.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that gh has a protective effect on mutant sod-1-expressing motor neurons.
