BACKGROUND
the toc <dig> family of proteins serve as receptors for chloroplast-destined preproteins. they directly bind to transit peptides, and exhibit preprotein substrate selectivity conferred by an unknown mechanism. the toc <dig> receptors each include three domains: c-terminal membrane, central gtpase, and n-terminal acidic  domains. although the function of the a-domain remains largely unknown, the amino acid sequences are most variable within these domains, suggesting they may contribute to the functional specificity of the receptors.


RESULTS
the physicochemical properties of the a-domains are characteristic of intrinsically disordered proteins . using cd spectroscopy we show that the a-domains of two arabidopsis toc <dig> family members  are disordered at physiological ph and temperature and undergo conformational changes at temperature and ph extremes that are characteristic of idps.


CONCLUSIONS
identification of the a-domains as idps will be important for determining their precise function, and suggests a role in protein-protein interactions, which may explain how these proteins serve as receptors for such a wide variety of preprotein substrates.
