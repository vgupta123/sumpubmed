BACKGROUND
acetate is a commonly used substrate for biosynthesis while monochloroacetate is a structurally similar compound but toxic and inhibits cell metabolism by blocking the citric acid cycle. in burkholderia species mba <dig> haloacetate was utilized as a carbon and energy source for growth. the degradation of haloacid was mediated by the production of an inducible dehalogenase. recent studies have identified the presence of a concomitantly induced haloacetate-uptake activity in mba <dig>  this uptake activity has also been found to transport acetate. since acetate transporters are commonly found in bacteria it is likely that haloacetate was transported by such a system in mba <dig> 


RESULTS
the haloacetate-uptake activity of mba <dig> was found to be induced by monochloroacetate  and monobromoacetate . while the acetate-uptake activity was also induced by mca and mba, other alkanoates: acetate, propionate and 2-monochloropropionate  were also inducers. competing solute analysis showed that acetate and propionate interrupted the acetate- and mca- induced acetate-uptake activities. while mca, mba, 2mcpa, and butyrate have no effect on acetate uptake they could significantly quenched the mca-induced mca-uptake activity. transmembrane electrochemical potential was shown to be a driving force for both acetate- and mca- transport systems.


CONCLUSIONS
here we showed that acetate- and mca- uptake in burkholderia species mba <dig> are two transport systems that have different induction patterns and substrate specificities. it is envisaged that the shapes and the three dimensional structures of the solutes determine their recognition or exclusion by the two transport systems.
