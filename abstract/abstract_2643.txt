BACKGROUND
with the rapid advancement of cell biology, the evaluation of a given protein’s synthesis and release in cells becomes critical. however, up to now there has been no technique available to morphologically visualize and measure a newly synthesized protein in cells, nor can we measure the protein’s release from the cells.


RESULTS
in this study, we developed a set of assays combining pulse chase amino acid substitution, non-radioactive labeling, and immunofluorescence co-localization to visualize newly synthesized proteins in individual cells and then to detect their release using modified elisa. we demonstrated the synthesis and release of bcl- <dig>  mmp- <dig>  and immunoglobulin g  in a human trophoblast cell line, of which the last finding has not been reported previously.


CONCLUSIONS
this new technique offers a powerful tool to evaluate the dynamics of the synthesis and release of target proteins in individual cultured cells with wide applications in genetic and protein analysis.
