BACKGROUND
diapause, a state of arrested development accompanied by a marked decrease of metabolic rate, helps insects to overcome unfavorable seasons. helicoverpa armigera  undergoes pupal diapause, but the molecular mechanism of diapause initiation is unclear. using suppression subtractive hybridization , we investigated differentially expressed genes in diapause- and nondiapause-destined pupal brains at diapause initiation.


RESULTS
we constructed two ssh libraries  to isolate genes that are up-regulated or down-regulated at diapause initiation. we obtained  <dig> unique sequences in the f library and  <dig> unique sequences in the r library. further, genes expression at the mrna and protein level in diapause- and nondiapause-destined pupal brains were confirmed by rt-pcr, northern blot or western blot analysis. finally, we classified the genes and predicted their possible roles at diapause initiation.


CONCLUSIONS
differentially expressed genes at pupal diapause initiation are possibly involved in the regulation of metabolism, energy, stress resistance, signaling pathways, cell cycle, transcription and translation.
