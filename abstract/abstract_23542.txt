BACKGROUND
panax notoginseng  f.h. chen is important medicinal plant of the araliacease family. triterpene saponins are the bioactive constituents in p. notoginseng. however, available genomic information regarding this plant is limited. moreover, details of triterpene saponin biosynthesis in the panax species are largely unknown.


RESULTS
using the  <dig> pyrosequencing technology, a one-quarter gs flx titanium run resulted in  <dig>  reads with an average length of  <dig> bases for p. notoginseng root. these reads were processed and assembled by  <dig> gs de novo assembler software into  <dig>  unique sequences. a total of  <dig> % of unique sequences were annotated by basic local alignment search tool  similarity searches against public sequence databases. the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  assignment discovered  <dig> unique sequences representing  <dig> genes involved in triterpene saponin backbone biosynthesis in the 454-est dataset. in particular, the transcript encoding dammarenediol synthase , which is the first committed enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of major triterpene saponins, is highly expressed in the root of four-year-old p. notoginseng. it is worth emphasizing that the candidate cytochrome p <dig>  and udp-glycosyltransferase  gene most likely to be involved in hydroxylation or glycosylation of aglycones for triterpene saponin biosynthesis were discovered from  <dig> cytochrome p450s and  <dig> glycosyltransferases by phylogenetic analysis, respectively. putative transcription factors were detected in  <dig> unique sequences, including myb, homeobox, wrky, basic helix-loop-helix , and other family proteins. additionally, a total of  <dig>  simple sequence repeat  were identified from  <dig>  unique sequences, of which, di-nucleotide motifs were the most abundant motif.


CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first to present a large-scale est dataset for p. notoginseng root acquired by next-generation sequencing  technology. the candidate genes involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis, including the putative cyp450s and ugts, were obtained in this study. additionally, the identification of ssrs provided plenty of genetic makers for molecular breeding and genetics applications in this species. these data will provide information on gene discovery, transcriptional regulation and marker-assisted selection for p. notoginseng. the dataset establishes an important foundation for the study with the purpose of ensuring adequate drug resources for this species.
