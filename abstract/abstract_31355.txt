BACKGROUND
several protein-protein interaction studies have been performed for the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae using different high-throughput experimental techniques. all these results are collected in the biogrid database and the sgd database provide detailed annotation of the different proteins. despite the value of biogrid for studying protein-protein interactions, there is a need for manual curation of these interactions in order to remove false positives.


RESULTS
here we describe an annotated reconstruction of the protein-protein interactions around four key nutrient-sensing and metabolic regulatory signal transduction pathways  operating in saccharomyces cerevisiae. the reconstructed stp network includes a full protein-protein interaction network including the key nodes snf <dig>  tor <dig>  hog <dig> and pka <dig>  the network includes a total of  <dig> structural open reading frames  and  <dig> protein-protein interactions. a number of proteins were identified having interactions with more than one of the protein kinases. the fully reconstructed interaction network includes all the information available in separate databases for all the proteins included in the network  and for all the interactions between them . the annotated information is readily available utilizing the functionalities of network modelling tools such as cytoscape and celldesigner.


CONCLUSIONS
the reported fully annotated interaction model serves as a platform for integrated systems biology studies of nutrient sensing and regulation in s. cerevisiae. furthermore, we propose this annotated reconstruction as a first step towards generation of an extensive annotated protein-protein interaction network of signal transduction and metabolic regulation in this yeast.
