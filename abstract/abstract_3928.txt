BACKGROUND
plasmids containing hylefm  were previously shown to increase gastrointestinal colonization and lethality of enterococcus faecium in experimental peritonitis. the hylefm gene, predicting a glycosyl hydrolase, has been considered as a virulence determinant of hospital-associated e. faecium, although its direct contribution to virulence has not been investigated. here, we constructed mutants of the hylefm-region and we evaluated their effect on virulence using a murine peritonitis model.


RESULTS
five mutants of the hylefm-region of phylefmtx <dig> from the sequenced endocarditis strain  were obtained using an adaptation of the phes* system and were evaluated in a commensal strain tx1330rf to which phylefmtx <dig> was transferred by mating; these include i) deletion of hylefm only; ii) deletion of the gene downstream of hylefm  of unknown function; iii) deletion of hylefm plus down; iv) deletion of hylefm-down and two adjacent genes; and v) a  <dig>  bp deletion including these four genes plus partial deletion of two others, with replacement by cat. the  <dig>  bp deletion did not affect virulence of tx <dig> in peritonitis but, when phylefmtx16Î” <dig>  was transferred to the tx1330rf background, the transconjugant was affected in in vitro growth versus tx1330rf and was attenuated in virulence; however, neither hylefm nor hylefm-down restored wild type function. we did not observe any in vivo effect on virulence of the other deletions of the hylefm-region


CONCLUSIONS
the four genes of the hylefm region  do not mediate the increased virulence conferred by phylefmtx <dig> in murine peritonitis. the use of the markerless counterselection system phes* should facilitate the genetic manipulation of e. faecium in the future.
