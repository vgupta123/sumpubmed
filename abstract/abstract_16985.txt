BACKGROUND
phaseolus vulgaris  is the second most important legume crop in the world after soybean. consequently, yield losses due to fungal infection, like uromyces appendiculatus , have strong consequences. several resistant genes were identified that confer resistance to bean rust infection. however, the downstream genes and mechanisms involved in bean resistance to infection are poorly characterized.


RESULTS
a subtractive bean cdna library composed of  <dig>  unisequences was constructed and enriched in sequences regulated by either bean rust race  <dig>  a virulent strain, or race  <dig>  an avirulent strain on cultivar early gallatin carrying the resistance gene ur- <dig>  the construction of this library allowed the identification of  <dig>  new bean ests, significantly adding to the available sequences for this plant. regulation of selected bean genes in response to bean rust infection was confirmed by qrt-pcr. plant gene expression was similar for both race  <dig> and  <dig> during the first  <dig> hours of the infection process but varied significantly at the later time points  mainly due to the presence of the avr <dig> gene in the race  <dig> leading to a hypersensitive response in the bean plants. a biphasic pattern of gene expression was observed for several genes regulated in response to fungal infection.


CONCLUSIONS
the enrichment of the public database with over  <dig>  bean ests significantly adds to the genomic resources available for this important crop plant. the analysis of these genes in response to bean rust infection provides a foundation for further studies of the mechanism of fungal disease resistance. the expression pattern of  <dig> bean genes upon rust infection shares several features with other legumes infected by biotrophic fungi. this finding suggests that the p. vulgaris-u. appendiculatus pathosystem could serve as a model to explore legume-rust interaction.
