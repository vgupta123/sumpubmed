BACKGROUND
identifying the genotypes underlying human disease phenotypes is a
fundamental step in human genetics and medicine. high-throughput genomic
technologies provide thousands of genetic variants per individual. the
causal genes of a specific phenotype are usually expected to be functionally
close to each other. according to this hypothesis, candidate genes are
picked from high-throughput data on the basis of their biological proximity
to core genes â€” genes already known to be responsible for the
phenotype. there is currently no effective gene-centric online interface for
this purpose.


RESULTS
we describe here the human gene connectome server , a powerful,
easy-to-use interactive online tool enabling researchers to prioritize any
list of genes according to their biological proximity to core genes
associated with the phenotype of interest. we also make available an updated
and extended version for all human gene-specific connectomes. the hgcs is
freely available to noncommercial users from:
http://hgc.rockefeller.edu/.


CONCLUSIONS
the hgcs should help investigators from diverse fields to identify new
disease-causing candidate genes more effectively, via a user-friendly online
interface.
