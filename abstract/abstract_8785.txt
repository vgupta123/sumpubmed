BACKGROUND
physical and linkage maps are important aids for the assembly of genome sequences, comparative analyses of synteny, and to search for candidate genes by quantitative trait locus analysis. yellowtail, seriola quinqueradiata, is an economically important species in japanese aquaculture, and genetic information will be useful for dna-assisted breeding. we report the construction of a second generation radiation hybrid map, its synteny analysis, and a second generation linkage map containing snps  in yellowtail.


RESULTS
approximately  <dig>  million reads were obtained from transcriptome sequence analysis derived from  <dig> tissues of one individual. to identify snps, cdna libraries were generated from a pool of  <dig> whole juveniles, and the gills and kidneys of  <dig> adults.  <dig>  putative snps were detected in  <dig>  contigs, with a minor allele frequency ≥25%. the linkage and radiation hybrid maps were constructed based on these contig sequences.  <dig>  markers, including  <dig> snps markers, were mapped onto the linkage map, and  <dig>  markers were mapped in the radiation hybrid map.


CONCLUSIONS
the second generation linkage and physical maps were constructed using  <dig>  contigs having snp markers. these maps will aid the de novo assembly of sequencing reads, linkage studies and the identification of candidate genes related to important traits. the comparison of marker contigs in the radiation hybrid map indicated that yellowtail is evolutionarily closer to medaka than to green-spotted pufferfish, three-spined stickleback or zebrafish. the synteny analysis may aid studies of chromosomal evolution in yellowtail compared with model fish.
