BACKGROUND
it is known that transcription factors frequently act together to regulate gene expression in eukaryotes. in this paper we describe a computational analysis of transcription factor site dependencies in human, mouse and rat genomes.


RESULTS
our approach for quantifying tendencies of transcription factor binding sites to co-occur is based on a binding site scoring function which incorporates dependencies between positions, the use of information about the structural class of each transcription factor , and also considered the possible implications of varying gc content of the sequences. significant tendencies  have been detected by non-parametric statistical methodology . evaluation of obtained results has been performed in several ways: reports from literature ; dependencies between transcription factors are not biased due to similarities in their dna-binding sites; the number of dependent transcription factors that belong to the same functional and structural class is significantly higher than would be expected by chance; supporting evidence from go clustering of targeting genes. based on dependencies between two transcription factor binding sites , it is possible to construct higher-order dependencies . moreover results about transcription factor binding sites dependencies can be used for prediction of groups of dependent transcription factors on a given promoter sequence. our results, as well as a scanning tool for predicting groups of dependent transcription factors binding sites are available on the internet.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that the computational analysis of transcription factor site dependencies is a valuable complement to experimental approaches for discovering transcription regulatory interactions and networks. scanning promoter sequences with dependent groups of transcription factor binding sites improve the quality of transcription factor predictions.
