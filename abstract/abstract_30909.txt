BACKGROUND
human glutamic acid decarboxylase  <dig>  is a key autoantigen in type  <dig> diabetes, having much potential as an important marker for the prediction and diagnosis of type  <dig> diabetes, and for the development of novel antigen-specific therapies for the treatment of type  <dig> diabetes. however, recombinant production of hgad <dig> using conventional bacterial or mammalian cell culture-based expression systems or nuclear transformed plants is limited by low yield and low efficiency. chloroplast transformation of the unicellular eukaryotic alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii may offer a potential solution.


RESULTS
a dna cassette encoding full-length hgad <dig>  under the control of the c. reinhardtii chloroplast rbcl promoter and 5'- and 3'-utrs, was constructed and introduced into the chloroplast genome of c. reinhardtii by particle bombardment. integration of hgad <dig> dna into the algal chloroplast genome was confirmed by pcr. transcriptional expression of hgad <dig> was demonstrated by rt-pcr. immunoblotting verified the expression and accumulation of the recombinant protein. the antigenicity of algal-derived hgad <dig> was demonstrated with its immunoreactivity to diabetic sera by elisa and by its ability to induce proliferation of spleen cells from nod mice. recombinant hgad <dig> accumulated in transgenic algae, accounts for approximately  <dig> â€“ <dig> % of its total soluble protein.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate the potential value of c. reinhardtii chloroplasts as a novel platform for rapid mass production of immunologically active hgad <dig>  this demonstration opens the future possibility for using algal chloroplasts as novel bioreactors for the production of many other biologically active mammalian therapeutic proteins.
