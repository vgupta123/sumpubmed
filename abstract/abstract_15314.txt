BACKGROUND
the cronobacter genus  has come to prominence due to its association with infant infections, and the ingestion of contaminated reconstituted infant formula. c. sakazakii and c. malonaticus are closely related, and are defined according their biotype. due to the ubiquitous nature of the organism, and the high severity of infection for the immunocompromised, a multilocus sequence typing  scheme has been developed for the fast and reliable identification and discrimination of c. sakazakii and c. malonaticus strains. it was applied to  <dig> strains of c. sakazakii and  <dig> strains of c. malonaticus, including the index strains used to define the biotypes. the strains were from clinical and non-clinical sources between  <dig> and  <dig> in usa, canada, europe, new zealand and the far east.


RESULTS
this scheme uses  <dig> loci; atpd, fusa, glns, gltb, gyrb, infb, and pps. there were  <dig> sequence types  identified in c. sakazakii, and  <dig> in c. malonaticus. a third  of c. sakazakii strains were in st <dig>  which had almost equal numbers of clinical and infant formula isolates from  <dig> to  <dig>  st <dig> may represent a particularly virulent grouping of c. sakazakii as 7/ <dig> strains were clinical in origin which had been isolated between  <dig> -  <dig>  from four countries. c. malonaticus divided into three sts. the previous cronobacter biotyping scheme did not clearly correspond with sts nor with species.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, mlst is a more robust means of identifying and discriminating between c. sakazakii and c. malonaticus than biotyping. the mlst database for these organisms is available online at http://pubmlst.org/cronobacter/.
