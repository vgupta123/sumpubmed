BACKGROUND
a member of the tahkt2; <dig> multigene family was previously identified as a na+ transporter with a possible role in root na+ uptake. in the present study, the existing full-length cdna of this member was used as a basis to query the international wheat genome survey sequence to identify all members of the tahkt2; <dig> family. individual tahkt2; <dig> genes were subsequently studied for gene and predicted protein structures, promoter variability, tissue expression and their role in na+ and k+ status of wheat.


RESULTS
six tahkt2; <dig> genes were characterized which included four functional genes  and two pseudogenes , on chromosomes 7a, 7b and 7d of hexaploid wheat. variability in protein domains for cation specificity and in cis-regulatory elements for salt response in gene promoters, were identified amongst the functional tahkt2; <dig> members. the functional genes were expressed under low and high nacl conditions in roots and leaf sheaths, but were down regulated in leaf blades. alternative splicing events were evident in tahkt2; <dig> 7al- <dig>  aneuploid lines null for each functional gene were grown in high nacl nutrient solution culture to identify potential role of each tahkt2; <dig> member. aneuploid lines null for tahkt2; <dig> 7al- <dig>  tahkt2; <dig> 7bl- <dig> and tahkt2; <dig> 7bl- <dig> showed no difference in na+ concentration between chinese spring except for higher na+ in sheaths. the same aneuploid lines had lower k+ in roots, sheath and youngest fully expanded leaf but only under high  nacl in the external solution. there was no difference in na+ or k+ concentration for any treatment between aneuploid line null for the tahkt2; <dig> 7dl- <dig> gene and chinese spring.


CONCLUSIONS
tahkt2; <dig> is a complex family consisting of pseudogenes and functional members. tahkt2; <dig> genes do not have an apparent role in controlling root na+ uptake in bread wheat seedlings under experimental conditions in this study, contrary to existing hypotheses. however, tahkt2; <dig> genes or, indeed other genes in the same chromosome region on 7al, are candidates that may control na+ transport from root to sheath and regulate k+ levels in different plant tissues.
