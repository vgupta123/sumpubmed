BACKGROUND
hiv associated dementia  is a common complication of human immunodeficiency virus  infection that erodes the quality of life for patients and burdens health care providers. intravenous drug use is a major route of hiv transmission, and drug use is associated with increased had. specific proteins released as a consequence of hiv infection  have been implicated in the pathogenesis of had. in primary cultures of human fetal brain tissue, subtoxic doses of gp <dig> and tat are capable of interacting with a physiologically relevant dose of cocaine, to produce a significant synergistic neurotoxicity. using this model system, the neuroprotective potential of gonadal steroids was investigated.


RESULTS
17β-estradiol , but not 17α-estradiol , was protective against this combined neurotoxicity. progesterone  afforded limited neuroprotection, as did dihydrotestosterone . the efficacy of 5α-testosterone -mediated neuroprotection was robust, similar to that provided by 17β-e <dig>  in the presence of the specific estrogen receptor  antagonist, ici- <dig> , t's neuroprotection was completely blocked. thus, t acts through the er to provide neuroprotection against hiv proteins and cocaine. interestingly, cholesterol also demonstrated concentration-dependent neuroprotection, possibly attributable to cholesterol's serving as a steroid hormone precursor in neurons.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, the present data indicate that cocaine has a robust interaction with the hiv proteins gp <dig> and tat that produces severe neurotoxicity, and this toxicity can be blocked through pretreatment with er agonists.
