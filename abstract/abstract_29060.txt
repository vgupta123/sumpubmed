BACKGROUND
some functions of  <dig> r in non-erythroid cells are directly related with its distinct sub-cellular localisation during cell cycle phases. during mitosis,  <dig> r is implicated in cell cycle progression and spindle pole formation, and co-localizes with numa <dig>  however, during interphase  <dig> r is located in the nucleus and only partially co-localizes with numa <dig> 


RESULTS
we have characterized by nmr the structural features of the c-terminal domain of  <dig> r and those of the minimal region  involved in the interaction with numa <dig>  this subdomain behaves as an intrinsically unfolded protein containing a central region with helical tendency. the specific residues implicated in the interaction with numa <dig> have been mapped by nmr titrations and involve the n-terminal and central helical regions. the segment of numa <dig> that interacts with  <dig> r is phosphorylated during mitosis. interestingly, nmr data indicates that the phosphorylation of numa <dig> interacting peptide provokes a change in the interaction mechanism. in this case, the recognition occurs through the central helical region as well as through the c-terminal region of the subdomain meanwhile the n-terminal region do not interact.


CONCLUSIONS
these changes in the interaction derived from the phosphorylation state of numa <dig> suggest that phosphorylation can act as subtle mechanism of temporal and spatial regulation of the complex  <dig> r-numa <dig> and therefore of the processes where both proteins play a role.
