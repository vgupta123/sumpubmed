BACKGROUND
corn borers are the primary maize pest; their feeding on the pith results in stem damage and yield losses. in this study, we performed a genome-wide association study  to identify snps associated with resistance to mediterranean corn borer in a maize diversity panel using a set of more than  <dig>  snps.


RESULTS
twenty five snps were significantly associated with three resistance traits:  <dig> were significantly associated with tunnel length,  <dig> with stem damage, and  <dig> with kernel resistance. allelic variation at each significant snp was associated with from  <dig> to 9% of the phenotypic variance. a set of genes containing or physically close to these snps are proposed as candidate genes for borer resistance, supported by their involvement in plant defense-related mechanisms in previously published evidence. the linkage disequilibrium decayed  rapidly within short distance, suggesting high resolution of gwas associations.


CONCLUSIONS
most of the candidate genes found in this study are part of signaling pathways, others act as regulator of expression under biotic stress condition, and a few genes are encoding enzymes with antibiotic effect against insects such as the cystatin <dig> gene and the defensin proteins. these findings contribute to the understanding the complex relationship between plant-insect interactions.
