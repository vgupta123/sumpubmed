BACKGROUND
detecting candidate b-cell epitopes in a protein is a basic and fundamental step in many immunological applications. due to the impracticality of experimental approaches to systematically scan the entire protein, a computational tool that predicts the most probable epitope regions is desirable.


RESULTS
the epitopia server is a web-based tool that aims to predict immunogenic regions in either a protein three-dimensional structure or a linear sequence. epitopia implements a machine-learning algorithm that was trained to discern antigenic features within a given protein. the epitopia algorithm has been compared to other available epitope prediction tools and was found to have higher predictive power. a special emphasis was put on the development of a user-friendly graphical interface for displaying the results.


CONCLUSIONS
epitopia is a user-friendly web-server that predicts immunogenic regions for both a protein structure and a protein sequence. its accuracy and functionality make it a highly useful tool. epitopia is available at  and includes extensive explanations and example predictions.
