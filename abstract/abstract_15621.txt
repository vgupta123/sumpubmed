BACKGROUND
in today's age of genomic discovery, no attempt has been made to comprehensively sequence a gymnosperm genome. the largest genus in the coniferous family pinaceae is pinus, whose 110- <dig> species have extremely large genomes . the size and complexity of these genomes have prompted much speculation as to the feasibility of completing a conifer genome sequence. conifer genomes are reputed to be highly repetitive, but there is little information available on the nature and identity of repetitive units in gymnosperms. the pines have extensive genetic resources, with approximately  <dig> ests from eleven species and genetic maps in eight species, including a dense genetic map of the twelve linkage groups in pinus taeda.


RESULTS
we present here the sanger sequence and annotation of ten p. taeda bac clones and genome analyzer ii whole genome shotgun  sequences representing  <dig> % of the genome. computational annotation of ten bacs predicts three putative protein-coding genes and at least fifteen likely pseudogenes in nearly one megabase of sequence. we found three conifer-specific ltr retroelements in the bacs, and tentatively identified at least  <dig> others based on evidence from the distantly related angiosperms. alignment of wgs sequences to the bacs indicates that 80% of bac sequences have similar copies  elsewhere in the genome, but only 23% have identical copies . the three most common repetitive elements in the genome were identified and, when combined, represent less than 5% of the genome.


CONCLUSIONS
this study indicates that the majority of repeats in the p. taeda genome are 'novel' and will therefore require additional bac or genomic sequencing for accurate characterization. the pine genome contains a very large number of diverged and probably defunct repetitive elements. this study also provides new evidence that sequencing a pine genome using a wgs approach is a feasible goal.
