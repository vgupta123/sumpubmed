BACKGROUND
nitrogen  is an essential and often limiting nutrient to plant growth and development. previous studies have shown that the mrna expressions of numerous genes are regulated by nitrogen supplies; however, little is known about the expressed non-coding elements, for example long non-coding rnas  that control the response of maize  to nitrogen. lncrnas are a class of non-coding rnas larger than 200 bp, which have emerged as key regulators in gene expression.


RESULTS
in this study, we surveyed the intergenic/intronic lncrnas in maize b <dig> leaves at the v <dig> stage under conditions of n-deficiency and n-sufficiency using ribosomal rna depletion and ultra-deep total rna sequencing approaches. by integration with mrna expression profiles and physiological evaluations,  <dig> lncrnas and  <dig> nitrogen-responsive lncrnas were identified that exhibited unique expression patterns. co-expression network analysis showed that the nitrogen-responsive lncrnas were enriched mainly in one of the three co-expressed modules. the genes in the enriched module are mainly involved in nadh dehydrogenase activity, oxidative phosphorylation and the nitrogen compounds metabolic process.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified a large number of lncrnas in maize and illustrated their potential regulatory roles in response to n stress. the results lay the foundation for further in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms of lncrnas’ role in response to nitrogen stresses.
