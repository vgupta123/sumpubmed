BACKGROUND
a whole-genome genotyping array has previously been developed for malus using snp data from  <dig> malus genotypes. this array offers the prospect of high throughput genotyping and linkage map development for any given malus progeny. to test the applicability of the array for mapping in diverse malus genotypes, we applied the array to the construction of a snp-based linkage map of an apple rootstock progeny.


RESULTS
of the  <dig>  malus snp markers on the array,  <dig>   were heterozygous in one of the two parents of the progeny,  <dig>   were heterozygous in both parental genotypes, whilst just  <dig> % of the  <dig> pyrus snps were heterozygous. a linkage map spanning  <dig> .2 cm was produced comprising  <dig>  snp markers,  <dig> ssr markers and the s-locus. the length of the m <dig> linkage map was increased by  <dig>  cm with the addition of the snp markers, whilst marker density increased from  <dig>  cm/marker to  <dig>  cm/marker. just three regions in excess of 10 cm remain where no markers were mapped. we compared the positions of the mapped snp markers on the m <dig> map with their predicted positions on the ‘golden delicious’ genome sequence. a total of  <dig> markers  mapped to positions that conflicted with their predicted positions on the ‘golden delicious’ pseudo-chromosomes, indicating the presence of paralogous genomic regions or mis-assignments of genome sequence contigs during the assembly and anchoring of the genome sequence.


CONCLUSIONS
we incorporated data for the  <dig>  snp markers onto the map of the m <dig> progeny and have presented the most complete and saturated map of the full  <dig> linkage groups of m. pumila to date. the data were generated rapidly in a high-throughput semi-automated pipeline, permitting significant savings in time and cost over linkage map construction using microsatellites. the application of the array will permit linkage maps to be developed for qtl analyses in a cost-effective manner, and the identification of snps that have been assigned erroneous positions on the ‘golden delicious’ reference sequence will assist in the continued improvement of the genome sequence assembly for that variety.
