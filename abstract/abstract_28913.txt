BACKGROUND
the genetic make-up of humans and other mammals  affects their resistance to influenza virus infection. considering the complexity and moral issues associated with experiments on human subjects, we have only acquired partial knowledge regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms. although influenza resistance in inbred mice has been mapped to several quantitative trait loci , which have greatly narrowed down the search for host resistance genes, only few underlying genes have been identified.


RESULTS
to prioritize a list of promising candidates for future functional investigation, we applied network-based approaches to leverage the information of known resistance genes and the expression profiles contrasting susceptible and resistant mouse strains. the significance of top-ranked genes was supported by different lines of evidence from independent genetic associations, qtl studies, rna interference  screenings, and gene expression analysis. further data mining on the prioritized genes revealed the functions of two pathways mediated by tumor necrosis factor : apoptosis and tnf receptor- <dig> signaling pathways. we suggested that the delicate balance between tnf’s pro-survival and apoptotic effects may affect hosts’ conditions after influenza virus infection.


CONCLUSIONS
this study considerably cuts down the list of candidate genes responsible for host resistance to influenza and proposed novel pathways and mechanisms. our study also demonstrated the efficacy of network-based methods in prioritizing genes for complex traits.
