BACKGROUND
hordeum chilense, a native south american diploid wild barley, is a potential source of useful genes for cereal breeding. the use of this wild species to increase genetic variation in cereals will be greatly facilitated by marker-assisted selection. different economically feasible approaches have been undertaken for this wild species with limited direct agricultural use in a search for suitable and cost-effective markers. the availability of expressed sequence tags  derived microsatellites or simple sequence repeat  markers, commonly called as est-ssrs, for barley  represents a promising source to increase the number of genetic markers available for the h. chilense genome.


RESULTS
all of the  <dig> barley est-derived ssr primer pairs tested for transferability to h. chilense amplified products of correct size from this species. of these  <dig> barley est-ssrs,  <dig>  showed polymorphism among h. chilense lines. identified polymorphic markers were used to test the transferability and polymorphism in other poaceae family species with the aim of establishing h. chilense phylogenetic relationships. triticum aestivum-h. chilense addition lines allowed us to determine the chromosomal localizations of est-ssr markers and confirm conservation of the linkage group.


CONCLUSIONS
from the present study a set of  <dig> polymorphic est-ssr markers have been identified to be useful for diversity analysis of h. chilense, related wild barleys like h. murinum, and for wheat marker-assisted introgression breeding. across-genera transferability of the barley est-ssr markers has allowed phylogenetic inference within the triticeae complex.
