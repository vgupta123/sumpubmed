BACKGROUND
in fungi, light is primarily known to influence general morphogenesis and both sexual and asexual sporulation. in order to expand the knowledge on the effect of light in fungi and to determine the role of the light regulatory protein envoy in the implementation of this effect, we performed a global screen for genes, which are specifically effected by light in the fungus hypocrea jecorina  using rapid subtraction hybridization . based on these data, we analyzed whether these genes are influenced by envoy and if overexpression of envoy in darkness would be sufficient to execute its function.


RESULTS
the cellular functions of the detected light responsive genes comprised a variety of roles in transcription, translation, signal transduction, metabolism, and transport. their response to light with respect to the involvement of envoy could be classified as follows:  envoy-mediated upregulation by light;  envoy-independent upregulation by light;  envoy-antagonized upregulation by light; envoy-dependent repression by light;  envoy-independent repression by light; and  both positive and negative regulation by envoy of genes not responsive to light in the wild-type. envoy was found to be crucial for normal growth in light on various carbon sources and is not able to execute its regulatory function if overexpressed in the darkness.


CONCLUSIONS
the different responses indicate that light impacts fungi like h. jecorina at several cellular processes, and that it has both positive and negative effects. the data also emphasize that envoy has an apparently more widespread cellular role in this process than only in modulating the response to light.
