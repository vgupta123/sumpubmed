BACKGROUND
genes that are co-expressed tend to be involved in the same biological process. however, co-expression is not a very reliable predictor of functional links between genes. the evolutionary conservation of co-expression between species can be used to predict protein function more reliably than co-expression in a single species. here we examine whether co-expression across multiple species is also a better prioritizer of disease genes than is co-expression between human genes alone.


RESULTS
we use co-expression data from yeast , nematode worm , fruit fly , mouse and human and find that the use of evolutionary conservation can indeed improve the predictive value of co-expression. the effect that genes causing the same disease have higher co-expression than do other genes from their associated disease loci, is significantly enhanced when co-expression data are combined across evolutionarily distant species. we also find that performance can vary significantly depending on the co-expression datasets used, and just using more data does not necessarily lead to better prioritization. instead, we find that dataset quality is more important than quantity, and using a consistent microarray platform per species leads to better performance than using more inclusive datasets pooled from various platforms.


CONCLUSIONS
we find that evolutionarily conserved gene co-expression prioritizes disease candidate genes better than human gene co-expression alone, and provide the integrated data as a new resource for disease gene prioritization tools.
