BACKGROUND
scf ubiquitin ligases target numerous proteins for ubiquitin dependent proteolysis, including p <dig> and cyclin e. scf and other cullin-ring ligases  are regulated by the ubiquitin-like protein nedd <dig> that covalently modifies the cullin subunit. the removal of nedd <dig> is catalyzed by the jab1/mpn domain metalloenzyme  motif within the csn <dig> subunit of the cop <dig> signalosome.


RESULTS
here, we conditionally knock down csn <dig> expression in hek <dig> human cells using a doxycycline-inducible shrna system. cullin levels were not altered in csn-deficient human cells, but the levels of multiple f-box proteins were decreased. molecular analysis indicates that this decrease was due to increased cul1- and proteasome-dependent turnover. diminished f-box levels resulted in reduced scf activity, as evidenced by accumulation of two substrates of the f-box protein fbw <dig>  cyclin e and c-myc, in csn5-depleted cells.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that deneddylation of cul <dig> is required to sustain optimal activity of scf ubiquitin ligases by repressing 'autoubiquitination' of f-box proteins within scf complexes, thereby rescuing them from premature degradation.
