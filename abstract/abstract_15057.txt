BACKGROUND
segmenting electron microscopy  images of cellular and subcellular processes in the nervous system is a key step in many bioimaging pipelines involving classification and labeling of ultrastructures. however, fully automated techniques to segment images are often susceptible to noise and heterogeneity in em images . supervised techniques to address this problem are often helpful but require large sets of training data, which are often difficult to obtain in practice, especially across many conditions.


RESULTS
we propose a new, principled unsupervised algorithm to segment em images using a two-step approach: edge detection via salient watersheds following by robust region merging. we performed experiments to gather em neuroimages of two organisms  using different histological preparations and generated manually curated ground-truth segmentations. we compared our algorithm against several state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation algorithms and found superior performance using two standard measures of under-and over-segmentation error.


CONCLUSIONS
our algorithm is general and may be applicable to other large-scale segmentation problems for bioimages.
