BACKGROUND
dermatophytes are the primary causative agent of dermatophytoses, a disease that affects billions of individuals worldwide. trichophyton rubrum is the most common of the superficial fungi. although t. rubrum is a recognized pathogen for humans, little is known about how its transcriptional pattern is related to development of the fungus and establishment of disease. it is therefore necessary to identify genes whose expression is relevant to growth, metabolism and virulence of t. rubrum.


RESULTS
we generated  <dig> cdna libraries covering nearly the entire growth phase and used them to isolate  <dig>  unique expressed sequence tags , including  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. comparisons with the genbank non-redundant  protein database revealed putative functions or matched homologs from other organisms for  <dig>   of the ests. the remaining  <dig>   of ests were only weakly similar or not similar to known sequences, suggesting that these ests represent novel genes.


CONCLUSIONS
the present data provide a comprehensive view of fungal physiological processes including metabolism, sexual and asexual growth cycles, signal transduction and pathogenic mechanisms.
