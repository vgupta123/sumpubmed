BACKGROUND
boris , a paralogue of the multifunctional and ubiquitously expressed transcription factor ctcf, is best known for its role in transcriptional regulation. in the nucleus, boris is particularly enriched in the nucleolus, a crucial compartment for ribosomal rna and rna metabolism. however, little is known about cytoplasmic boris, which represents the major pool of boris protein.


RESULTS
we show, firstly, that boris has a putative nuclear export signal in the c-terminal domain. furthermore, boris associates with mrna in both neural stem cells and young neurons. the majority of the boris-associated transcripts are different in the two cell types. finally, by using polysome profiling we show that boris is associated with actively translating ribosomes.


CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated the rna binding properties of cellular boris and its association with actively translating ribosomes. we suggest that boris is involved in gene expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.
