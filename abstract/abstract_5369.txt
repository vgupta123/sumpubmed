BACKGROUND
haemophilus influenzae requires heme for aerobic growth and possesses multiple mechanisms to obtain this essential nutrient. although an understanding of the heme acquisition mechanisms of h. influenzae is emerging, significant gaps in our knowledge remain. unresolved issues include the identities of all genes exhibiting altered transcription in response to iron and heme availability, the fraction of such genes functioning in iron/heme acquisition, and the heterogeneity of this gene set among clinical isolates. previously we utilized h. influenzae strain rd kw <dig> to demonstrate the utility of transcriptional profiling in defining the genes exhibiting altered transcription in response to environmental iron and heme levels. the current study expands upon those observations by determining the iron/heme modulons of two clinical isolates, the type b isolate  <dig> and the nontypeable isolate r <dig>  these data are used to begin to define the core iron/heme modulon of the species.


RESULTS
microarray studies were performed to compare gene expression on transition from iron/heme-restricted to iron/heme-replete conditions for each isolate. of  <dig> orfs on the array corresponding to r <dig> genes,  <dig> were significantly differentially expressed:  <dig> were maximally transcribed under iron/heme-replete conditions and  <dig> under iron/heme-restricted conditions. of the  <dig> orfs representing genes of strain  <dig>   <dig> were significantly differentially transcribed:  <dig> were preferentially transcribed under iron/heme-replete conditions and  <dig> under iron/heme-restricted conditions. comparison of the data sets indicated that  <dig> genes exhibited similar regulation in both isolates and that  <dig> of these exhibited similar patterns of regulation in rd kw <dig>  these comprise the putative core iron/heme modulon.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides evidence for a conserved core of h. influenzae genes the transcription of which is altered by the availability of iron and/or heme in the growth environment. elucidation of this modulon provides a means to identify genes with unrecognized roles in iron/heme acquisition or homeostasis, unanticipated responsiveness to environmental levels of the micronutrients or potential roles in virulence. defining these core genes is also of potential importance in identifying targets for therapeutic and vaccine designs since products of these genes are likely to be preferentially expressed during growth in iron/heme restricted sites of the human body.
