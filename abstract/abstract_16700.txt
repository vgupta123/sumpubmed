BACKGROUND
continuous theta burst stimulation  is a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation which has been shown to alter cortical excitability in the upper limb representation of primary somatosensory cortex . however, it is unknown whether ctbs modulates cortical excitability within the lower limb representation in si. the present study investigates the effects of ctbs over the si lower limb representation on cortical somatosensory evoked potentials  and hoffmann reflex  following tibial nerve stimulation at the knee. seps and h-reflex were recorded before and in four time blocks up to  <dig> minutes following ctbs targeting the lower limb representation within si.


RESULTS
following ctbs, the p1-n <dig> first cortical potential was significantly decreased at 12â€“ <dig> minutes. ctbs also suppressed the p2-n <dig> second cortical potential for up to  <dig> minutes following stimulation. the h-reflex remained statistically unchanged following ctbs although there was a modest suppression observed.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that ctbs decreases cortical excitability of the lower limb representation of si as evidenced by suppressed sep amplitude. the duration and magnitude of the ctbs after effects are similar to those observed in upper limb studies.
