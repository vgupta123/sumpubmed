BACKGROUND
rice sheath blight, caused by rhizoctonia solani is one of the most devastating diseases of rice. it is associated with significant reduction in rice productivity worldwide. a mutant variant of mannose binding allium sativum leaf agglutinin  was previously reported to exhibit strong antifungal activity against r. solani. in this study, the masal gene has been evaluated for its in planta antifungal activity in rice plants.


RESULTS
masal was cloned into pcambia <dig> binary vector under the control of camv35s promoter. it was expressed in an elite indica rice cv. ir <dig> by employing agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. molecular analyses of transgenic plants confirmed the presence and stable integration of masal gene. immunohistofluorescence analysis of various tissue sections of plant parts clearly indicated the constitutive expression of masal. the segregation pattern of masal transgene was observed in t <dig> progenies in a 3: <dig> mendelian ratio. the expression of masal was confirmed in t <dig> and t <dig> plants through western blot analysis followed by elisa. in planta bioassay of transgenic lines against r. solani exhibited an average of 55 % reduction in sheath blight percentage disease index .


CONCLUSIONS
the present study opens up the possibility of engineering rice plants with the antifungal gene masal, conferring resistance to sheath blight.
