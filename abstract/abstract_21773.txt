BACKGROUND
the myeloid translocation gene  proteins are non-dna-binding transcriptional regulators capable of interacting with chromatin modifying proteins. as a consequence of leukemia-associated chromosomal translocations, two of the mtg proteins, mtg <dig> and mtg <dig>  are fused to the dna-binding domain of aml <dig>  a transcriptional activator crucial for hematopoiesis. the aml1-mtg fusion proteins, as the wild type mtgs, display four conserved homology regions  related to the drosophila nervy protein. structural protein analyses led us to test the hypothesis that specific mtg domains may mediate rna binding.


RESULTS
by using an rna-binding assay based on synthetic rna homopolymers and a panel of mtg deletion mutants, here we show that all the mtg proteins can bind rna. the rna-binding properties can be traced to two regions: the zinc finger domains in the nhr <dig>  which mediate zinc-dependent rna binding, and a novel short basic region  upstream of the nhr <dig>  which mediates zinc-independent rna binding. the two aml1-mtg fusion proteins, retaining both the zinc fingers domains and the sbr, also display rna-binding properties.


CONCLUSIONS
evidence has been accumulating that rna plays a role in transcriptional control. both wild type mtgs and chimeric aml1-mtg proteins display in vitro rna-binding properties, thus opening new perspectives on the possible involvement of an rna component in mtg-mediated chromatin regulation.
