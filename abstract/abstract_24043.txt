BACKGROUND
microarray analysis and  <dig> cdna sequencing were used to investigate a centuries-old problem in regenerative biology: the basis of nerve-dependent limb regeneration in salamanders. innervated  and denervated  forelimbs of mexican axolotls were amputated and transcripts were sampled after  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days of regeneration.


RESULTS
considerable similarity was observed between nr and dl transcriptional programs at  <dig> and  <dig> days post amputation . genes with extracellular functions that are critical to wound healing were upregulated while muscle-specific genes were downregulated. thus, many processes that are regulated during early limb regeneration do not depend upon nerve-derived factors. the majority of the transcriptional differences between nr and dl limbs were correlated with blastema formation; cell numbers increased in nr limbs after  <dig> dpa and this yielded distinct transcriptional signatures of cell proliferation in nr limbs at  <dig> dpa. these transcriptional signatures were not observed in dl limbs. instead, gene expression changes within dl limbs suggest more diverse and protracted wound-healing responses.  <dig> cdna sequencing complemented the microarray analysis by providing deeper sampling of transcriptional programs and associated biological processes. assembly of new  <dig> cdna sequences with existing expressed sequence tag  contigs from the ambystoma est database more than doubled  the number of non-redundant human-a. mexicanum orthologous sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
many new candidate gene sequences were discovered for the first time and these will greatly enable future studies of wound healing, epigenetics, genome stability, and nerve-dependent blastema formation and outgrowth using the axolotl model.
