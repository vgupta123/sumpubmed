BACKGROUND
assessment of potential allergenicity of protein is necessary whenever transgenic proteins are introduced into the food chain. bioinformatics approaches in allergen prediction have evolved appreciably in recent years to increase sophistication and performance. however, what are the critical features for protein's allergenicity have been not fully investigated yet.


RESULTS
we presented a more comprehensive model in  <dig> features space for allergenic proteins prediction by integrating various properties of proteins, such as biochemical and physicochemical properties, sequential features and subcellular locations. the overall accuracy in the cross-validation reached  <dig> % to 100% with our new method. maximum relevance minimum redundancy  method and incremental feature selection  procedure were applied to obtain which features are essential for allergenicity. results of the performance comparisons showed the superior of our method to the existing methods used widely. more importantly, it was observed that the features of subcellular locations and amino acid composition played major roles in determining the allergenicity of proteins, particularly extracellular/cell surface and vacuole of the subcellular locations for wheat and soybean. to facilitate the allergen prediction, we implemented our computational method in a web application, which can be available at http://gmobl.sjtu.edu.cn/preal/index.php.


CONCLUSIONS
our new approach could improve the accuracy of allergen prediction. and the findings may provide novel insights for the mechanism of allergies.
