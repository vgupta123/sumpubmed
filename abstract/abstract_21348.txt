BACKGROUND
the h <dig> histamine receptor is a gi-coupled gpcr that has been proven to exist in different agonist-induced states, including that defined by the protean agonist proxyfan. several gpcrs are now known to exist in different states. for some of these, antagonist affinity measurement remain constant regardless of the state of the receptor, for others e.g. the beta-adrenoceptors, the antagonist affinity measurements vary considerably depending on which agonist-dependent state is being identified. the purpose of this study was to examine the antagonist affinity measurements at the gi-coupling human h <dig> receptor, paying particular attention to measurements made in the presence of full agonists, partial agonists and the proxyfan protean agonist-induced state of the receptor.


RESULTS
cho cells stably expressing the human histamine h <dig> receptor and a cre-spap reporter were used. measurements of cre-gene transcription and 3h-camp accumulation were made. a range of ligands of different agonist efficacies were determined, including some partial agonists e.g. vuf  <dig>  unlike other gi-coupled receptors, no gs-coupled state of the receptor was detected with these ligands. antagonist affinity measurements were constant, whether the measurements were made in the presence of a full agonist, a partial agonist or the protean agonist proxyfan.


CONCLUSIONS
in contrast to all three subtypes of the beta-adrenoceptors, but in keeping with the traditional pharmacological dogma, antagonist affinity measurements remained constant at the human h <dig> receptor, including the medium-efficacy proxyfan-induced state of the receptor and the vuf5681-induced state of the receptor.
