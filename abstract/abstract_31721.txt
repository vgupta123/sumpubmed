BACKGROUND
the objective of this study was to develop and assess the reliability of a modified scoring system for evaluating the function of the two pelvic limbs separately, in ambulatory thoracolumbar myelopathy dogs. a previously established neurologic score scale for dogs with t3-l <dig> lesions was modified in order to provide a separate score for each pelvic limb.


RESULTS
seventeen ambulatory dogs with thoracolumbar myelopathies were evaluated. using the new scale, two observers independently performed  <dig> observational gait analyses  in ten dogs without videotape. another  <dig> ogas were performed in seven dogs by watching videotapes of them ambulating. there was poor agreement  between the two observers for all  <dig> ogas. when stratified, the agreement was moderate  in the ogas without videotaping and poor  for the ogas based on videotapes. for the decision regarding which pelvic limb was more severely affected, a fair agreement  between the two observers was noted. without videotape there was only slight agreement , but with videotape there was moderate agreement .


CONCLUSIONS
the modified scoring system in this study provides moderate reliability in assessing the functional neurologic status of each pelvic limb, by oga without videotape, in canine t3-l <dig> patients. further development of this scoring system is required. however, imperfect agreement when visually quantifying neurological deficits is not unexpected.
