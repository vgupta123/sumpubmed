BACKGROUND
eating and rumination variables were recorded in  <dig> healthy lactating dairy cows of  <dig> different breeds . eating and rumination variables were monitored during a 24-h period using an automated system that recorded jaw movements via a pressure sensor integrated into the noseband of a halter. phases of eating and rumination were reliably identified in the recordings based on typical patterns seen in previous studies. the variables analysed included duration of eating and rumination, number of chewing cycles during eating and rumination, number of regurgitated cuds and number of chewing cycles per cud.


RESULTS
the cows ate for an average of 265 ± 54 min and chewed  <dig>  ±  <dig> times per day. the duration of rumination was 441 ± 71 min, there were 578 ±  <dig> cuds per day and 55 ±  <dig> chewing cycles per cud. there were significant correlations  between duration of eating and number of chewing cycles during eating , between duration of rumination and number of chewing cycles per regurgitated cud  and between duration of rumination and number of regurgitated cuds per day .


CONCLUSIONS
the eating and rumination variables established in the present study reflect the current conditions of swiss dairy farming and serve as reference intervals for assessing sick cows.
