BACKGROUND
haemophilus influenzae is an important human commensal pathogen associated with significant levels of disease. high-throughput dna sequencing was used to investigate differences in genome content within this species.


RESULTS
genomic dna sequence was obtained from  <dig> strains of h. influenzae and from other related species, selected based on geographical site of isolation, disease association and documented genotypic and phenotypic differences. when compared by mauve alignment these indicated groupings of h. influenzae that were consistent with previously published analyses; capsule expressing strains fell into two distinct groups and those of serotype b  were found in two closely positioned lineages. for  <dig> hib strains representing both lineages we found many discrete regions  displaying sequence variation when compared to a common reference strain. evidence that this naturally occurring pattern of inter-strain variation in h. influenzae can be mediated by transformation was obtained through sequencing dna obtained from a pool of  <dig> independent transformants of a recipient  using donor dna from a heterologous hib strain .


CONCLUSIONS
much of the inter-strain variation in genome sequence in h. influenzae is likely the result of inter-strain exchanges of dna, most plausibly through transformation.
