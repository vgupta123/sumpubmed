BACKGROUND
human killer immunoglobulin-like receptors  play a critical role in governing the immune response to neoplastic and infectious disease. rhesus macaques serve as important animal models for many human diseases in which kirs are implicated; however, the study of kir activity in this model is hindered by incomplete characterization of kir genetics.


RESULTS
here we present a characterization of kir genetics in rhesus macaques . we conducted a survey of kirs in this species, identifying  <dig> novel full-length kir sequences. using this expanded sequence library to build upon previous work, we present evidence supporting the existence of  <dig> mamu-kir genes, providing a framework within which to describe macaque kirs. we also developed a novel pyrosequencing-based technique for kir genotyping. this method provides both comprehensive kir genotype and frequency estimates of transcript level, with implications for the study of kirs in all species.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study significantly improve our understanding of macaque kir genetic organization and diversity, with implications for the study of many human diseases that use macaques as a model. the ability to obtain comprehensive kir genotypes is of basic importance for the study of kirs, and can easily be adapted to other species. together these findings both advance the field of macaque kirs and facilitate future research into the role of kirs in human disease.
