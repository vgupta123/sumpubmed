BACKGROUND
fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  is a promising drug candidate to combat metabolic diseases. however, high-level expression and purification of recombinant fgf <dig>  in escherichia coli  is difficult because rfgf <dig> forms inclusion bodies in the bacteria making it difficult to purify and obtain high concentrations of bioactive rfgf <dig>  to overcome this problem, we fused the fgf <dig> with sumo  by polymerase chain reaction , and expressed the fused gene in e. coli bl <dig> 


RESULTS
by inducing with iptg, sumo-fgf <dig> was expressed at a high level. its concentration reached 30% of total protein, and exceeded 95% of all soluble proteins. the fused protein was purified by deae sepharose ff and ni-nta affinity chromatography. once cleaved by the sumo protease, the purity of rfgf <dig> by high performance liquid chromatography  was shown to be higher than 96% with low endotoxin level . the results of in vivo animal experiments showed that rfgf <dig> produced by using this method, could decrease the concentration of plasma glucose in diabetic rats by streptozotocin  injection.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that sumo, when fused with fgf <dig>  was able to promote its soluble expression of the latter in e. coli, making it more convenient to purify rfgf <dig> than previously. this may be a better method to produce rfgf <dig> for pharmaceutical research and development.
