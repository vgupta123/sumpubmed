BACKGROUND
the hila protein is the master regulator of the salmonella pathogenicity island  <dig> . eila and ygeh proteins show a moderate similarity to hila and are encoded in pathogenicity islands from several e. coli strains, both pathogenic and non-pathogenic. in the present work we characterize the ygeh protein from the enteroaggregative e. coli strain  <dig> .


RESULTS
we show that both e. coli  <dig> ygeh and eila proteins are able to functionally replace hila in salmonella. interestingly, this is not the rule for all ygeh proteins: the ygeh protein from the enterohaemorragic e. coli strain o <dig> appears to be non-functional. ygeh expression is not influenced by growth osmolarity or temperature, and moderately increases in cells entering the stationary phase. h-ns represses ygeh expression under all growth conditions tested, and binds with specificity to the ygeh promoter region. as expected, expression of ett <dig>  genes requires ygeh: ett <dig> operons are downregulated in a ygeh mutant. accordingly, since h-ns represses ygeh expression, ett <dig> expression is significantly increased in an hns mutant.


CONCLUSIONS
e. coli  <dig> ygeh protein is functional and able to replace hila in salmonella. ett <dig> gene expression requires ygeh activity which, in turn, is subjected to h-ns silencing.
