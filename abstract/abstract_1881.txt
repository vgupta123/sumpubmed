BACKGROUND
previous studies have demonstrated that neonatal manipulation of oxytocin  has effects on the expression of estrogen receptor α  and the central production of oxytocin observed in juveniles . the goal of this study was to determine whether the effects of neonatal manipulation of ot last into adulthood, and if the effects differ from those observed during the early postnatal period. on the first day of life, prairie voles  received one of three doses of ot , an ot antagonist, or isotonic saline. another group was handled, but not injected. then as adults, brains were collected, sectioned, and stained for erα or ot using immunocytochemistry.


RESULTS
in females, treatment with ot increased the expression of erα immunoreactivity in the ventral lateral septum  and the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and central amygdala . in males, ot antagonist increased erα expression in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. there was no apparent effect of ot on the number of cells producing ot in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.


CONCLUSIONS
the current results suggest that neonatal manipulation of ot has long-term organizational effects on the expression of erα in both males and females. the lack of effect on ot neurons in the paraventricular nucleus suggests that some developmental effects of ot previously observed in weanlings do not persist into adulthood. developmental effects of ot on erα patterns were sexually dimorphic, dose-dependent, and site-specific.
