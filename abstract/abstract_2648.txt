BACKGROUND
voltage gated sodium channels nav <dig>  are involved in nociceptor nerve action potentials and are known to affect pain sensitivity in clinical genetic disorders.

aims and objectives
to study nav <dig>  levels in dental pulpitis pain, an inflammatory condition, and burning mouth syndrome , considered a neuropathic orofacial pain disorder.

methods
two groups of patients were recruited for this study. one group consisted of patients with dental pulpitis pain  and controls , and the other patients with bms  and controls . bms patients were diagnosed according to the international association for the study of pain criteria; a pain history was collected, including the visual analogue scale . immunohistochemistry with visual intensity and computer image analysis were used to evaluate levels of nav <dig>  in dental pulp tissue samples from the dental pulpitis group, and tongue biopsies from the bms group.


RESULTS
there was a significantly increased visual intensity score for nav <dig>  in nerve fibres in the painful dental pulp specimens, compared to controls. image analysis showed a trend for an increase of the nav <dig>  immunoreactive % area in the painful pulp group, but this was not statistically significant. when expressed as a ratio of the neurofilament % area, there was a strong trend for an increase of nav <dig>  in the painful pulp group. nav <dig>  immunoreactive fibres were seen in abundance in the sub-mucosal layer of tongue biopsies, with no significant difference between bms and controls.


CONCLUSIONS
nav <dig>  sodium channel may play a significant role in inflammatory dental pain. clinical trials with selective nav <dig>  channel blockers should prioritise dental pulp pain rather than bms.
