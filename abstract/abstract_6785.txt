BACKGROUND
during formation of the vertebrate central nervous system, the hindbrain is organized into segmental units, called rhombomeres . these cell-lineage restricted segments are separated by a subpopulation of cells known as boundary cells. boundary cells display distinct molecular and cellular properties such as an elongated shape, enriched extracellular matrix components and a reduced proliferation rate compared to intra-rhombomeric cells. however, little is known regarding their functions and the mechanisms that regulate their formation.


RESULTS
hindbrain boundary cells express several signaling molecules, such as fgf <dig>  which at earlier developmental stages is transiently expressed in specific rhombomeres. we show that chick embryos that lack boundary cells due to overexpression of truncated epha <dig> receptor in the hindbrain have continued segmental expression of fgf <dig> at stages when it is normally restricted to hindbrain boundaries. furthermore, surgical ablation of the boundary between r <dig> and r <dig>  or blocking of the contact of r <dig> with boundary cells, results in sustained fgf <dig> expression in this segment.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that boundary cells are required for the downregulation of segmental fgf <dig>  presumably mediated by a soluble factor that emanates from boundaries. we propose that this new function of boundary cells enables a switch in gene expression that may be required for stage-specific functions of fgf <dig> in the developing hindbrain.
