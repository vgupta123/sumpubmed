BACKGROUND
in the developing embryo, total rna abundance fluctuates caused by functional rna degradation and zygotic genome activation. these variations in the transcriptome in early development complicate the choice of good reference genes for gene expression studies by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction.


RESULTS
in order to identify stably expressed genes for normalisation of quantitative data, within early stages of development, transcription levels were examined of  <dig> frequently used reference genes  at different stages of early porcine embryonic development . analysis of transcription profiling by genorm software revealed that gapdh, pgk <dig>  s <dig>  and ubc showed high stability in early porcine embryonic development, while transcription levels of b2m, bact, and h2a were highly regulated.


CONCLUSIONS
good reference genes that reflect total rna content were identified in early embryonic development from oocyte to blastocyst. a selection of either gapdh or pgk <dig>  together with ribosomal protein s <dig> , and ubc is proposed as reference genes, but the use of b2m, bact, or h2a is discouraged.
