BACKGROUND
bovine viral diarrhea virus  is a pathogen of domestic and wildlife animals worldwide and is associated with several diseases. in china, there are many reports about genotyping of bvdv strains originated from cattle and pigs, and some of them focused on the geographical distributions of bvdv. currently, the goat industry in jiangsu province of china is under going a rapid expansion. most of these goat farms are backyard enterprises and in close proximity to pig and cattle farms. however, there was very limited information about bvdv infections in goats. the objective of this study was to assess the frequency of bvdv infections of goats, the relationship of these infections to clinical signs and determine what bvdv genotypes are circulating in jiangsu province.


RESULTS
from  <dig> goat sera collected from six regions in jiangsu province between  <dig> and  <dig>  bvdv- <dig> was identified in  <dig> samples from the five regions by rt-pcr. the bvdv- <dig> infections occurred with/without clinical signs. eight different bvdv- <dig> strains were identified from these positive samples based on the 5′-untranslated region  sequences, and further clustered into four bvdv- <dig> subtypes on the phylogenetic analysis. three were bvdv-1b, two bvdv-1m, two bvdv-1o, and one bvdv-1p, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate the occurrence of bvdv and the genotypes of bvdv infecting goats in china. the results indicated that bvdv- <dig> infections were indeed present and the viruses were with genetic variations in chinese goat herds. the information would be very useful for prevention and control of bvdv- <dig> infections in china.
