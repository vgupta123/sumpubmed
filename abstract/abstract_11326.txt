BACKGROUND
micrornas  play important regulatory roles in development and stress response in plants. wild soybean  has undergone long-term natural selection and may have evolved special mechanisms to survive stress conditions as a result. however, little information about mirnas especially mirnas responsive to aluminum  stress is available in wild soybean.


RESULTS
two small rna libraries and two degradome libraries were constructed from the roots of al-treated and al-free g. soja seedlings. for mirna identification, a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads in al-treated and al-free small rnas libraries, respectively, were generated, and  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified. in addition,  <dig> p <dig> or p <dig> strands of known mirnas were found. among all the identified mirnas, the expressions of  <dig> mirnas were responsive to al stress. through degradome sequencing,  <dig> genes were identified as targets of the known mirnas and five genes were found to be the targets of the novel mirnas obtained in this study. gene ontology  annotations of target transcripts indicated that  <dig> target genes cleaved by conserved mirna families might play roles in the regulation of transcription. additionally, some genes, such as those for the auxin response factor , domain-containing disease resistance protein , leucine-rich repeat and toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor-like protein  domain protein, cation transporting atpase, myb transcription factors, and the no apical meristem  protein, that are known to be responsive to stress, were found to be cleaved under al stress conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
a number of mirnas and their targets were detected in wild soybean. some of them that were responsive to biotic and abiotic stresses were regulated by al stress. these findings provide valuable information to understand the function of mirnas in al tolerance.
