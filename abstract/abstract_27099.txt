BACKGROUND
sclerotinia head rot  is one of the most damaging diseases of sunflower in europe, argentina, and usa, causing average yield reductions of  <dig> to 20 %, but leading to total production loss under favorable environmental conditions for the pathogen. association mapping  is a promising choice for quantitative trait locus  mapping, as it detects relationships between phenotypic variation and gene polymorphisms in existing germplasm without development of mapping populations. this article reports the identification of qtl for resistance to shr based on candidate gene am.


RESULTS
a collection of  <dig> sunflower inbred lines were tested for shr under field conditions using assisted inoculation with the fungal pathogen sclerotinia sclerotiorum. given that no biological mechanisms or biochemical pathways have been clearly identified for shr,  <dig> candidate genes were selected based on previous transcript profiling studies in sunflower and brassica napus infected with s. sclerotiorum. associations among shr incidence and haplotype polymorphisms in  <dig> candidate genes were tested using mixed linear models  that account for population structure and kinship relationships. this approach allowed detection of a significant association between the candidate gene haric_b and shr incidence , accounting for a shr incidence reduction of about 20 %.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that am will be useful in dissecting other complex traits in sunflower, thus providing a valuable tool to assist in crop breeding.
