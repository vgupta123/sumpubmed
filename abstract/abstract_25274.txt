BACKGROUND
mycobacterium intracellulare, a species of the mycobacterium avium complex, may be the cause of severe lung, lymphatic node, skin and bone/joint infections, as well as bacteriemia. the goal of this work was to identify mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat  markers and to study their variability in a collection of isolates of m. intracellulare collected in humans. we studied  <dig> isolates collected in humans between  <dig> and  <dig>  as well as the reference strain, m. intracellulare atcc  <dig> 


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> miru-vntr candidates, of which  <dig> corresponded to the miru-vntr identified in the genome of m. intracellulare atcc  <dig>  among the  <dig> potential miru-vntr, seven were selected for use in a miru-vntr assay applied to our collection of isolates. forty-four patterns were found by miru-vntr typing and the discriminatory power of the assay was high with a hunter-gaston diversity index of  <dig> . we do not have evidence of a particular distribution of miru-vntr polymorphism according to clinical situation.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that miru-vntr typing could be used for molecular epidemiological studies applied to m. intracellulare.
