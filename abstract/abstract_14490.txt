BACKGROUND
aryl hydrocarbon receptor  not only regulates drug-metabolizing enzyme expression but also regulates cancer malignancy. the steps to the development of malignancy include angiogenesis that is induced by tumor microenvironments, hypoxia, and nutrient deprivation. vascular endothelial growth factor  plays a central role in the angiogenesis of cancer cells, and it is induced by activating transcription factor  <dig> .


RESULTS
recently, we identified that glucose deprivation induces ahr translocation into the nucleus and increases cyp1a <dig> and 1a <dig> expression in hepg <dig> cells. here, we report that the ahr pathway induces vegf expression in human hepatoblastoma hepg <dig> cells under glucose deprivation, which involves atf <dig>  atf <dig> knockdown suppressed vegf expression under glucose deprivation. moreover, ahr knockdown suppressed vegf and atf <dig> expression under glucose deprivation at genetic and protein levels.


CONCLUSIONS
the ahr-vegf pathway through atf <dig> is a novel pathway in glucose-deprived liver cancer cells that is related to the microenvironment within a cancer tissue affecting liver cancer malignancy.
