BACKGROUND
junctional adhesion molecule-a  is an adhesive protein expressed in various cell types. jam-a localizes to the tight junctions between contacting endothelial and epithelial cells, where it contributes to cell-cell adhesion and to the control of paracellular permeability.


RESULTS
so far, the expression pattern of jam-a has not been described in detail for the different cell types of the adult brain. here we show that a subset of proliferating cells in the adult mouse brain express jam-a. we further clarify that these cells belong to the lineage of ng2-glia cells. although these mitotic ng2-glia cells express jam-a, the protein never shows a polarized subcellular distribution. also non-mitotic ng2-glia cells express jam-a in a non-polarized pattern on their surface.


CONCLUSIONS
our data show that jam-a is a novel surface marker for ng2-glia cells of the adult brain.
