BACKGROUND
the aim of the study was to detect whether in experimental salmonella enterica typhimurium infection the probiotic lactobacillus fermentum me- <dig> in combination with fluoroquinolone therapy would eradicate s. typhimurium, prevent the development of liver and spleen granulomas and improve the indices of oxidative stress in the ileum mucosa.

the selected bacteriological, histological and biochemical methods were applied.


RESULTS
combined treatment with l. fermentum me- <dig> and ofloxacin eradicated salmonella typhimurium from blood, ileum and liver, decreased the number of animals with liver and spleen granulomas and reduced the value of lipid peroxides in the ileum mucosa. higher total counts of intestinal lactobacilli in all experimental groups were associated with the absence of liver granulomas.


CONCLUSIONS
the antimicrobial and antioxidative probiotic l. fermentum me- <dig> combined with ofloxacin enhances the eradication of experimental s. typhimurium infection. these observations on probiotic and antimicrobial co-action may serve as basis to develop new strategies for treatment of invasive bacterial infections of the gut.
