BACKGROUND
colic could be accompanied by changes in the morphology and physiology of organs and tissues, such as the intestine. this process might be, at least in part, due to the accumulation of oxidative damage induced by reactive oxygen  and reactive nitrogen species , secondary to intestinal ischemia. glutathione , being the major intracellular thiol, provides protection against oxidative injury. the aim of this study was to investigate whether ischemia-induced intestinal injury could be related with alterations in gsh metabolism.


RESULTS
ischemia induced a significant increase in lipid hydroperoxides, nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, and a reduction in reduced glutathione, and adenosine triphosphate  content, as well as in methionine-adenosyl-transferase and methyl-transferase activities.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that ischemia induces harmful effects on equine small intestine, probably due to an increase in oxidative damage and proinflammatory molecules. this effect could be mediated, at least in part, by impairment in glutathione metabolism.
