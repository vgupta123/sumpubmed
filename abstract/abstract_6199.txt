BACKGROUND
transforming growth factor-beta  <dig>  has been implicated in hyperoxia-induced cell death and impaired alveolarization in the developing lung. in addition, the c-junnh2-terminal kinase  pathway has been shown to have a role for tgf-β1-mediated effects. we hypothesized that the jnk pathway is an important regulator of hyperoxia-induced pulmonary responses in the developing murine lung.


RESULTS
we used cultured human lung epithelial cells, fetal rat lung fibroblasts and a neonatal tgf-β <dig> transgenic mouse model. we demonstrate that hyperoxia inhibits cell proliferation, activates cell death mediators and causes cell death, and promotes myofibroblast transdifferentiation, in a dose-dependent manner. except for fibroblast proliferation, the effects were mediated via the jnk pathway. in addition, since we observed increased expression of tgf-β <dig> by epithelial cells on exposure to hyperoxia, we used a tgf-β <dig> transgenic mouse model to determine the role of jnk activation in tgf-β <dig> induced effects on lung development and on exposure to hyperoxia. we noted that, in this model, inhibition of jnk signaling significantly improved the spontaneously impaired alveolarization in room air and decreased mortality on exposure to hyperoxia.


CONCLUSIONS
when viewed in combination, these studies demonstrate that hyperoxia-induced cell death, myofibroblast transdifferentiation, tgf-β1- and hyperoxia-mediated pulmonary responses are mediated, at least in part, via signaling through the jnk pathway.
