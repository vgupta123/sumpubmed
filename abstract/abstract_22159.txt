BACKGROUND
comparison of recent patterns of recombination derived from linkage maps to historical patterns of recombination from linkage disequilibrium  could help identify genomic regions affected by strong artificial selection, appearing as reduced recent recombination. norwegian red cattle  make an interesting case study for investigating these patterns as it is an admixed breed with an extensively recorded pedigree. nrf have been under strong artificial selection for traits such as milk and meat production, fertility and health.

while measures of ld is also crucial for determining the number of markers required for association mapping studies, estimates of recombination rate can be used to assess quality of genomic assemblies.


RESULTS
a dataset containing more than  <dig>  genome-wide distributed snps and  <dig> animals was used to assess recombination rates and ld in nrf. although low ld measured by r <dig> was observed in nrf relative to some of the breeds from which this breed originates, reports from breeds other than those assessed in this study have described more rapid decline in r <dig> at short distances than what was found in nrf. rate of decline in r <dig> for nrf suggested that to obtain an expected r <dig> between markers and a causal polymorphism of at least  <dig>  for genome-wide association studies, approximately one snp every  <dig> kb or a total of  <dig>  snps would be required. for well known quantitative trait loci  for milk production traits on bos taurus chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  map length based on historic recombination was greater than map length based on recent recombination in nrf.

further, positions for  <dig> previously unpositioned contigs from assembly of the bovine genome sequence  found using comparative sequence analysis were validated by linkage analysis, and 28% of these positions corresponded to extreme values of population recombination rate.


CONCLUSIONS
while ld is reduced in nrf compared to some of the breeds from which this admixed breed originated, it is elevated over short distances compared to some other cattle breeds. genomic regions in nrf where map length based on historic recombination was greater than map length based on recent recombination coincided with some well known qtl regions for milk production traits.

linkage analysis in combination with comparative sequence analysis and detection of regions with extreme values of population recombination rate proved to be valuable for detecting problematic regions in the btau_ <dig>  genome assembly.
