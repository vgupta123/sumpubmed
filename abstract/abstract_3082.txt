BACKGROUND
pluripotent cells can be differentiated into many different cell types in vitro. successful differentiation is guided in large part by epigenetic reprogramming and regulation of critical gene expression patterns. recent genome-wide studies have identified the distribution of different histone-post-translational modifications  in various conditions and during cellular differentiation. however, our understanding of the abundance of histone ptms and their regulatory mechanisms still remain unknown.


RESULTS
here, we present a quantitative and comprehensive study of the abundance levels of histone ptms during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells  using mass spectrometry . we observed dynamic changes of histone ptms including increased h3k <dig> methylation levels in agreement with previously reported results. more importantly, we found a global decrease of multiply acetylated histone h <dig> peptides. brd <dig> targets acetylated h <dig> with a strong affinity to multiply modified h <dig> acetylation sites. we observed that the protein levels of brd <dig> decreased upon differentiation together with global histone h <dig> acetylation. inhibition of brd4:histone h <dig> interaction by the bet domain inhibitor -jq <dig> in escs results in enhanced differentiation to the endodermal lineage, by disrupting the protein abundance dynamics. genome-wide chip-seq mapping showed that brd <dig> and h <dig> acetylation are co-occupied in the genome, upstream of core pluripotency genes such as oct <dig> and nanog in escs and lineage-specific genes in embryoid bodies .


CONCLUSIONS
together, our data demonstrate the fundamental role of brd <dig> in monitoring cell differentiation through its interaction with acetylated histone marks and disruption of brd <dig> may cause aberrant differentiation.
