BACKGROUND
tetramethylpyrazine  is one of the most important active ingredients of a chinese herb ligusticum wallichii franchat, which is widely used in many ischemia disorders treatments. however, the exact mechanism by which tmp protects the spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion  injury is still unknown. for this purpose, rabbits were randomly divided into sham group, control group and tmp group. after the evaluation of neurologic function, the spinal cords were immediately removed for biochemical and histopathological analysis. apoptosis was measured quantitatively by the terminal transferase utp nick end-labeling  method and confirmed by electron microscopic examination, the expression of bax and bcl- <dig> was immunohistochemically evaluated and quantified by western blot analysis.


RESULTS
neurologic outcomes in the tmp-group were significantly better than those in the control group . tmp decreased spinal cord malondialdehyde  levels and ameliorated the down regulation of spinal cord superoxide dismutase  activity. tmp significantly reduced the loss of motoneurons and tunel-positive rate. greater bcl- <dig> and attenuated bax expression was found in the tmp treating rabbits.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that tmp has protective effects against spinal cord i/r injury by reducing apoptosis through regulating bcl- <dig> and bax expression.
