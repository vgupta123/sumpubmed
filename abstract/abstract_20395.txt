BACKGROUND
the presence of coliform bacteria is routinely assessed to establish the microbiological safety of water supplies and raw or processed foods. coliforms are a group of lactose-fermenting enterobacteriaceae, which most likely acquired the lacz gene by horizontal transfer and therefore constitute a polyphyletic group. among this group of bacteria is escherichia coli, the pathogen that is most frequently associated with foodborne disease outbreaks and is often identified by β-glucuronidase enzymatic activity or by the redundant detection of uida by pcr. because a significant fraction of essential e. coli genes are preserved throughout the bacterial kingdom, alternative oligonucleotide primers for specific e. coli detection are not easily identified.


RESULTS
in this manuscript, two strategies were used to design oligonucleotide primers with differing levels of specificity for the simultaneous detection of total coliforms and e. coli by multiplex pcr. a consensus sequence of lacz and the orphan gene yaio were chosen as targets for amplification, yielding 234 bp and 115 bp pcr products, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the assay designed in this work demonstrated superior detection ability when tested with lab collection and dairy isolated lactose-fermenting strains. while lacz amplicons were found in a wide range of coliforms, yaio amplification was highly specific for e. coli. additionally, yaio detection is non-redundant with enzymatic methods.
