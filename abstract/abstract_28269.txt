BACKGROUND
the scar/wave family of proteins mediates signals to actin assembly by direct activation of the arp2/ <dig> complex. these proteins have been characterised as major regulators of lamellipodia formation downstream of rac activation and as members of large protein complexes.


RESULTS
we have investigated the interactions of the three human scar/wave isoforms with several previously described binding partners for scar/wave  <dig> or  <dig>  we find that all three scar/wave isoforms behave similarly and are likely to participate in the same kinds of protein complexes that regulate actin assembly.


CONCLUSIONS
differences between scar/wave proteins are therefore likely to be at the level of tissue distribution or subtle differences in the affinity for specific binding partners.
