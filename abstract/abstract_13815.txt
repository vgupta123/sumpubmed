BACKGROUND
anopheles sinensis is an important mosquito vector of plasmodium vivax, which is the most frequent and widely distributed cause of recurring malaria throughout asia, and particularly in china, korea, and japan.


RESULTS
we performed  <dig> next-generation sequencing and obtained a draft sequence of a. sinensis assembled into scaffolds spanning  <dig>  million base pairs. analysis of this genome sequence, we observed expansion and contraction of several immune-related gene families in anopheline relative to culicine mosquito species. these differences suggest that species-specific immune responses to plasmodium invasion underpin the biological differences in susceptibility to plasmodium infection that characterize these two mosquito subfamilies.


CONCLUSIONS
the a. sinensis genome produced in this study, provides an important resource for analyzing the genetic basis of susceptibility and resistance of mosquitoes to plasmodium parasites research which will ultimately facilitate the design of urgently needed interventions against this debilitating mosquito-borne disease.
