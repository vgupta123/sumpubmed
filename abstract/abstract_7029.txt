BACKGROUND
computational pharmacology can uniquely address some issues in the process of drug development by providing a macroscopic view and a deeper understanding of drug action. specifically, network-assisted approach is promising for the inference of drug repurposing. however, the drug-target associations coming from different sources and various assays have much noise, leading to an inflation of the inference errors. to reduce the inference errors, it is necessary and critical to create a comprehensive and weighted data set of drug-target associations.


RESULTS
in this study, we created a weighted and integrated drug-target interactome  to provide a comprehensive resource of drug-target associations for computational pharmacology. we first collected drug-target interactions from six commonly used drug-target centered data sources including drugbank, kegg, ttd, matador, pdsp ki database, and bindingdb. then, we employed the record linkage method to normalize drugs and targets to the unique identifiers by utilizing the public data sources including pubchem, entrez gene, and uniprot. to assess the reliability of the drug-target associations, we assigned two scores  to each drug-target association based on their data sources and publication references. consequently, the windtome contains  <dig>  drug-target associations among  <dig>  compounds and  <dig>  genes. to assess the application of the windtome, we designed a network-based approach for drug repurposing using mental disorder schizophrenia  as a case. starting from  <dig> known scz drugs and their targets, we inferred a total of  <dig> potential scz drugs through the associations of drug-target with score_s higher than two in windtome and human protein-protein interactions. among the  <dig> scz-related drugs,  <dig> drugs have been investigated in clinical trials for scz treatment and  <dig> drugs for the treatment of other mental disorders, respectively. compared with the results using other score_s cutoff values, single data source, or the data from stitch, the inference of  <dig> scz-related drugs had the highest performance.


CONCLUSIONS
the windtome generated in this study contains comprehensive drug-target associations with confidence scores. its application to the scz drug repurposing demonstrated that the windtome is promising to serve as a useful resource for drug repurposing.
