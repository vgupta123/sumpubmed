BACKGROUND
nuclear localization of proteolytically formed intracellular fragment of erbb <dig> receptor tyrosine kinase has been shown to promote cell survival, and nuclear localization of erbb <dig> receptor has been described in human breast cancer. tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme  initiates the proteolytic cascade leading to erbb <dig> intracellular domain formation. interactions between matrix metalloproteases and heparan sulfate have been described, but the effect of cell surface heparan sulfate on tace activity has not been previously described.


RESULTS
as indicated by immunodetection of increased erbb <dig> intracellular domain formation and direct enzyme activity analysis, tace activity was substantially amplified by enzymatic removal of cell surface heparan sulfate but not chondroitin sulfate.


CONCLUSIONS
in this communication, we suggest a novel role for cell surface heparan sulfate. removal of cell surface heparan sulfate led to increased formation of erbb <dig> intracellular domain. as erbb <dig> intracellular domain has previously been shown to promote cell survival this finding may indicate a novel mechanism how hs degradation active in tumor tissue may favor cell survival.
