BACKGROUND
with the availability of rapidly increasing number of genome and transcriptome sequences, lineage-specific genes  can be identified and characterized. like other conserved functional genes, lsgs play important roles in biological evolution and functions.


RESULTS
two set of citrus lsgs,  <dig> citrus-specific genes  and  <dig> orphan genes specific to sweet orange, were identified by comparative analysis between the sweet orange genome sequences and  <dig> genomes and  <dig> transcriptomes. with the two sets of genes, gene structure and gene expression pattern were investigated. on average, both the csgs and orphan genes have fewer exons, shorter gene length and higher gc content when compared with those evolutionarily conserved genes . expression profiling indicated that most of the lsgs expressed in various tissues of sweet orange and some of them exhibited distinct temporal and spatial expression patterns. particularly, the orphan genes were preferentially expressed in callus, which is an important pluripotent tissue of citrus. besides, part of the csgs and orphan genes expressed responsive to abiotic stress, indicating their potential functions during interaction with environment.


CONCLUSIONS
this study identified and characterized two sets of lsgs in citrus, dissected their sequence features and expression patterns, and provided valuable clues for future functional analysis of the lsgs in sweet orange.
