BACKGROUND
in contrast to the three mammalian p <dig> family members, p <dig>  which is generally involved in dna damage responses, and p <dig> and p <dig> which are primarily needed for developmental regulation, cep- <dig> encodes for the single c. elegans p53-like gene. cep- <dig> acts as a transcription activator in a primordial p <dig> pathway that involves cep- <dig> activation and the cep- <dig> dependent transcriptional induction of the worm bh <dig> only domain encoding genes egl- <dig> and ced- <dig> to induce germ cell apoptosis. egl- <dig> and ced- <dig> proteins inactivate bcl- <dig> like ced- <dig> to trigger ced- <dig> and ced- <dig> caspase dependent germ cell apoptosis. to address the function of p <dig> in global transcriptional regulation we investigate genome-wide transcriptional responses upon dna damage and cep- <dig> deficiency.


RESULTS
examining c. elegans expression profiles using whole genome affymetrix genechip arrays, we found that  <dig> genes were induced more than two fold upon ionizing radiation . none of these genes, with exception of an atp ribosylase homolog, encode for known dna repair genes. using two independent cep- <dig> loss of function alleles we did not find genes regulated by cep- <dig> in the absence of ir. among the ir-induced genes only three are dependent on cep- <dig>  namely egl- <dig>  ced- <dig> and a novel c. elegans specific gene. the majority of ir-induced genes appear to be involved in general stress responses, and qrt-pcr experiments indicate that they are mainly expressed in somatic tissues. interestingly, we reveal an extensive overlap of gene expression changes occurring in response to dna damage and in response to bacterial infection. furthermore, many genes induced by ir are also transcriptionally regulated in longevity mutants suggesting that dna damage and aging induce an overlapping stress response.


CONCLUSIONS
we performed genome-wide gene expression analyses which indicate that only a surprisingly small number of genes are regulated by cep- <dig> and that dna damage induced apoptosis via the transcriptional induction of bh <dig> domain proteins is likely to be an ancient dna damage response function of the p <dig> family. interestingly, although the apoptotic response to dna damage is regulated through the transcriptional activity of cep- <dig>  other dna damage responses do not appear to be regulated on the transcriptional level and do not require the p <dig> like gene cep- <dig>
