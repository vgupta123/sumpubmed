BACKGROUND
genome-wide association studies  have effectively identified genetic factors for many diseases. many diseases, including alzheimer’s disease , have epistatic causes, requiring more sophisticated analyses to identify groups of variants which together affect phenotype.


RESULTS
based on the gwas statistical model, we developed a multi-snp gwas analysis to identify pairs of variants whose common occurrence signaled the alzheimer’s disease phenotype.


CONCLUSIONS
despite not having sufficient data to demonstrate significance, our preliminary experimentation identified a high correlation between gria <dig> and hla-drb <dig> . gria <dig> has not been previously reported in association with ad, but is known to play a role in learning and memory.
