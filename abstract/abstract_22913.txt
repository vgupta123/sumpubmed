BACKGROUND
psoriasis lesions are characterized by large-scale shifts in gene expression. mechanisms that underlie differentially expressed genes , however, are not completely understood. we analyzed existing datasets to evaluate genome-wide expression in lesions from  <dig> psoriasis patients. our aims were to identify mechanisms that drive differential expression and to characterize heterogeneity among lesions in this large sample.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> psoriasis-increased degs and  <dig> psoriasis-decreased degs. increased degs were attributed to keratinocyte activity  and infiltration of lesions by t-cells  and macrophages . decreased degs, in contrast, were associated with adipose tissue , epidermis  and dermis . kc/epidermis degs were enriched for genes induced by il- <dig>  il-17a and il- <dig> family cytokines, and were also disproportionately associated with ap- <dig> binding sites. among all patients, 50% exhibited a heightened inflammatory signature, with increased expression of genes expressed by t-cells, monocytes and dendritic cells. 66% of patients displayed an ifn-γ-strong signature, with increased expression of genes induced by ifn-γ in addition to several other cytokines . we show that such differences in gene expression can be used to differentiate between etanercept responders and non-responders.


CONCLUSIONS
psoriasis degs are partly explained by shifts in the cellular composition of psoriasis lesions. epidermal degs, however, may be driven by the activity of ap- <dig> and cellular responses to il- <dig>  il-17a and il- <dig> family cytokines. among patients, we uncovered a range of inflammatory- and cytokine-associated gene expression patterns. such patterns may provide biomarkers for predicting individual responses to biologic therapy.
