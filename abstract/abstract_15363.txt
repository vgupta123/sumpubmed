BACKGROUND
upland cotton has the highest yield, and accounts for > 95% of world cotton production. decoding upland cotton genomes will undoubtedly provide the ultimate reference and resource for structural, functional, and evolutionary studies of the species. here, we employed genetrek and bac tagging information approaches to predict the general composition and structure of the allotetraploid cotton genome.


RESULTS
 <dig> bac sequences from gossypium hirsutum cv. maxxa were downloaded  and confirmed. these bac sequence analysis revealed that the tetraploid cotton genome contains over  <dig>  candidate genes with duplicated gene copies in homoeologous a- and d-subgenome regions. gene distribution is uneven, with gene-rich and gene-free regions of the genome. twenty-one percent of the  <dig> bacs lacked genes. bac gene density ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  per  <dig> kb, whereas most gene islands contained only one gene with an average of  <dig>  genes per island. retro-elements were found to be a major component, first an enriched ltr/gypsy and second ltr/copia. most ltr retrotransposons were truncated and in nested structures. in addition,  <dig> polymorphic loci amplified with ssrs developed from  <dig> bac clones were tagged on our backbone genetic map. seventy-five percent  of the polymorphic loci were tagged on the d-subgenome. by comprehensively analyzing the molecular size of amplified products among tetraploid g. hirsutum cv. maxxa, acc. tm- <dig>  and g. barbadense cv. hai <dig>  and diploid g. herbaceum var. africanum and g. raimondii,  <dig> bacs,  <dig> from the a- and  <dig> from the d-subgenome, were further anchored to their corresponding subgenome chromosomes. after a large amount of genes sequence comparison from different subgenome bacs, the result showed that introns might have no contribution to different subgenome size in gossypium.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides us with the first glimpse of cotton genome complexity and serves as a foundation for tetraploid cotton whole genomesequencing in the future.
