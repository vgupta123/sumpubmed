BACKGROUND
the per-arnt-sim  domain represents a ubiquitous structural fold that is involved in bacterial sensing and adaptation systems, including several virulence related functions. although pas domains and the subclass of phoq-dcus-cita  domains have a common structure, there is limited amino acid sequence similarity. to gain greater insight into the evolution of pdc/pas domains present in the bacterial kingdom and staphylococci in specific, the pdc/pas domains from the genomic sequences of  <dig> bacteria, representing  <dig> phyla, were identified using the sensitive search method based on hmm-to-hmm comparisons .


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  pas domains and  <dig> pdc domains distributed over  <dig>  proteins were identified. for  <dig> gram-positive bacteria, the distribution, organization, and molecular evolution of pdc/pas domains were analyzed in greater detail, with a special emphasis on the genus staphylococcus. compared to other bacteria the staphylococci have relatively fewer proteins  containing pdc/pas domains. as a general rule, the staphylococcal genomes examined in this study contain a core group of seven pdc/pas domain-containing proteins consisting of walk, srrb, phor, arls, hsss, nreb, and gdpp. the exceptions to this rule are: 1) s. saprophyticus lacks the core nreb protein; 2) s. carnosus has two additional pas domain containing proteins; 3) s. epidermidis, s. aureus, and s. pseudintermedius have an additional protein with two pdc domains that is predicted to code for a sensor histidine kinase; 4) s. lugdunensis has an additional pdc containing protein predicted to be a sensor histidine kinase.


CONCLUSIONS
this comprehensive analysis demonstrates that variation in pdc/pas domains among bacteria has limited correlations to the genome size or pathogenicity; however, our analysis established that bacteria having a motile phase in their life cycle have significantly more pdc/pas-containing proteins. in addition, our analysis revealed a tremendous amount of variation in the number of pdc/pas-containing proteins within genera. this variation extended to the staphylococcus genus, which had between  <dig> and  <dig> pdc/pas proteins and some of these appear to be previously undescribed signaling proteins. this latter point is important because most staphylococcal proteins that contain pdc/pas domains regulate virulence factor synthesis or antibiotic resistance.
