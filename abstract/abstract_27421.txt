BACKGROUND
the switch from cartilage template to bone during endochondral ossification of the growth plate requires a dynamic and close interaction between cartilage and the developing vasculature. vascular invasion of the primarily avascular hypertrophic chondrocyte zone brings chondroclasts, osteoblast- and endothelial precursor cells into future centres of ossification.

vascularization of human growth plates of polydactylic digits was studied by immunohistochemistry, confocal-laser-scanning-microscopy and rt-qpcr using markers specific for endothelial cells cd <dig> and cd <dig>  smooth muscle cells α-sma, endothelial progenitor cells cd <dig>  cxcr <dig>  vegfr- <dig> and mesenchymal progenitor cells cd <dig> and cd <dig>  in addition, morphometric analysis was performed to quantify runx2+ and dlx5+ hypertrophic chondrocytes, rank+ chondro- and osteoclasts, and cd133+ progenitors in different zones of the growth plate.


RESULTS
new vessels in ossification centres were formed by sprouting of cd34+ endothelial cells that did not co-express the mature endothelial cell marker cd <dig>  these immature vessels in the growth plate showed no abluminal coverage with α-sma+ smooth muscle cells, but in their close proximity single cd133+ precursor cells were found that did not express vegfr- <dig>  a marker for endothelial lineage commitment. in periosteum and in the perichondrial groove of ranvier that harboured cd90+/cd105+ chondro-progenitors, in contrast, mature vessels were found stabilized by α-sma+ smooth muscle cells.


CONCLUSIONS
vascularization of ossification centres of the growth plate was mediated by sprouting of capillaries coming from the bone collar or by intussusception rather than by de-novo vessel formation involving endothelial progenitor cells. vascular invasion of the joint anlage was temporally delayed compared to the surrounding joint tissue.
