BACKGROUND
we present a comprehensive technological solution for bacterial diagnostics using tmrna as a marker molecule. a robust probe design algorithm for microbial detection microarray is implemented. the probes were evaluated for specificity and, combined with nasba  amplification, for sensitivity.


RESULTS
we developed a new web-based program slicsel for the design of hybridization probes, based on nearest-neighbor thermodynamic modeling. a slicsel minimum binding energy difference criterion of  <dig> kcal/mol was sufficient to design of streptococcus pneumoniae tmrna specific microarray probes. with lower binding energy difference criteria, additional hybridization specificity tests on the microarray were needed to eliminate non-specific probes. using slicsel designed microarray probes and nasba we were able to detect s. pneumoniae tmrna from a series of total rna dilutions equivalent to the rna content of  <dig> - <dig> cfu.


CONCLUSIONS
the described technological solution and both its separate components slicsel and nasba-microarray technology independently are applicative for many different areas of microbial diagnostics.
