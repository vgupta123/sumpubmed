BACKGROUND
semigamy in cotton is a type of facultative apomixis controlled by an incompletely dominant autosomal gene . during semigamy, the sperm and egg cells undergo cellular fusion, but the sperm and egg nucleus fail to fuse in the embryo sac, giving rise to diploid, haploid, or chimeric embryos composed of sectors of paternal and maternal origin. in this study we sought to identify differentially expressed genes related to the semigamy genotype by implementing a comparative microarray analysis of anthers and ovules between a non-semigametic pima s- <dig> cotton and its doubled haploid natural isogenic mutant semigametic 57- <dig>  selected differentially expressed genes identified by the microarray results were then confirmed using quantitative reverse transcription pcr .


RESULTS
the comparative analysis between isogenic 57- <dig> and pima s- <dig> identified  <dig> genes in anthers and  <dig>  genes in ovules as being differentially expressed in the semigametic genotype 57- <dig>  based on gene functions,  <dig> differentially expressed genes were common to both semigametic anthers and ovules, with  <dig> being consistently differentially expressed in both tissues. nine of those genes were selected for qrt-pcr analysis, seven of which were confirmed. furthermore, several well characterized metabolic pathways including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis, and the biosynthesis of and response to plant hormones were shown to be affected by differentially expressed genes in the semigametic tissues.


CONCLUSIONS
as the first report using microarray analysis, several important metabolic pathways affected by differentially expressed genes in the semigametic cotton genotype have been identified and described in detail. while these genes are unlikely to be the semigamy gene itself, the effects associated with expression changes in those genes do mimic phenotypic traits observed in semigametic plants. a more in-depth analysis of semigamy is necessary to understand its expression and regulation at the genetic and molecular level.
