BACKGROUND
canine hip dysplasia  is characterised by a malformation of the hip joint, leading to osteoarthritis and lameness. current breeding schemes against chd have resulted in measurable but moderate responses. the application of marker-assisted selection, incorporating specific markers associated with the disease, or genomic selection, incorporating genome-wide markers, has the potential to dramatically improve results of breeding schemes. our aims were to identify regions associated with hip dysplasia or its related traits using genome and chromosome-wide analysis, study the linkage disequilibrium  in these regions and provide plausible gene candidates. this study is focused on the uk labrador retriever population, which has a high prevalence of the disease and participates in a recording program led by the british veterinary association  and the kennel club .


RESULTS
two genome-wide and several chromosome-wide qtls affecting chd and its related traits were identified, indicating regions related to hip dysplasia.


CONCLUSIONS
consistent with previous studies, the genetic architecture of chd appears to be based on many genes with small or moderate effect, suggesting that genomic selection rather than marker-assisted selection may be an appropriate strategy for reducing this disease.
