BACKGROUND

staphylococcus aureus  is one of the major pathogens causing mastitis in dairy ruminants worldwide. the chronic nature of staph. aureus infection enhances the contagiousness risk and diffusion in herds. in order to identify the factors involved in intra-mammary infection  and diffusion in dairy cows, we investigated the molecular characteristics of two groups of staph. aureus strains belonging to st <dig> and st <dig>  differing in clinical properties, through comparison of whole genome and whole transcriptome sequencing.


RESULTS
the two groups of strains, one originated from high imi prevalence herds and the other from low imi prevalence herds, present a peculiar set of genes and polymorphisms related to phenotypic features, such as bacterial invasion of mammary epithelial cells and host adaptation. transcriptomic analysis supports the high propensity of st <dig> strain to chronicity of infection and to a higher potential cytotoxicity.


CONCLUSIONS
our data are consistent with the invasiveness and host adaptation feature for the strains gtb/st <dig> associated to high within-herd prevalence of mastitis. variation in genes coding for surface exposed proteins and those associated to virulence and defence could constitute good targets for further research.
