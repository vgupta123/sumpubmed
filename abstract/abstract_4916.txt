BACKGROUND
the renal  and intestinal  electrogenic na+/hco3- cotransporter variants differ in their primary structure, transport direction, and response to secretagogues. previous studies have suggested that regulatory differences between the two subtypes can be partially explained by unique consensus phosphorylation sites included in the pnbc <dig>  but not the knbc <dig> sequence. after having shown activation of nbc by carbachol and forskolin in murine colon, we now investigated these pathways in hek <dig> cells transiently expressing a gfp-tagged pnbc <dig> construct. 


RESULTS
na+- and hco3--dependent phi recovery from an acid load  was enhanced by 5-fold in gfp-positive cells compared to the control cells in the presence of co2/hco3-. forskolin  had no effect in untransfected cells, but inhibited the phi recovery in cells expressing pnbc <dig> by 62%. after preincubation with carbachol , the phi recovery was enhanced to the same degree both in transfected and untransfected cells, indicating activation of endogenous alkalizing ion transporters. acid-activated na+/hco3- cotransport via pnbc <dig> expressed in renal cells is thus inhibited by camp and not affected by cholinergic stimulation, as opposed to the findings in native intestinal tissue. 


CONCLUSIONS
regulation of pnbc <dig> by secretagogues appears to be not solely dependent on its primary structure, but also on properties of the cell type in which it is expressed.
