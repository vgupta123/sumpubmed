BACKGROUND
ancestral wheat relatives are important sources of genetic diversity for the introduction of novel traits for the improvement of modern bread wheat. in this study the aim was to assess the susceptibility of  <dig> accessions of the diploid wheat triticum monococcum  to gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici , the causal agent of take-all disease. the second aim was to explore the susceptibility of tetraploid wheat  and the b genome progenitor species aegilops speltoides to ggt.


RESULTS
field trials, conducted over 5Â years, identified seven t. monococcum accessions with a good level of resistance to take-all when exposed to natural inoculum under uk field conditions. all other accessions were highly susceptible or did not exhibit a consistent phenotype across years. dart marker genotyping revealed that whole genome diversity was not closely related to resistance to take-all within t. monococcum, suggesting that multiple genetic sources of resistance may exist within the species. in contrast the tetraploid wheat cultivars and ae. speltoides were all highly susceptible to the disease, including those with known elevated levels of benzoxazinoids.


CONCLUSIONS
the diploid wheat species t. monococcum may provide a genetic source of resistance to take-all disease that could be utilised to improve the performance of t. aestivum in high disease risk situations. this represents an extremely valuable resource to achieve economic and sustainable genetic control of this root disease.
