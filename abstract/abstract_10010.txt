BACKGROUND
since chitin is a highly abundant natural biopolymer, many attempts have been made to convert this insoluble polysaccharide into commercially valuable products using chitinases and Î²-n-acetylglucosaminidases . we have previously reported the structure and function of chitinase a from vibrio harveyi  <dig>  this study t reports the identification of two glcnacases from the same organism and their detailed functional characterization.


RESULTS
the genes encoding two new members of family- <dig> glcnacases were isolated from the genome of v. harveyi  <dig>  cloned and expressed at a high level in e. coli. vhnag <dig> has a molecular mass of  <dig> kda and an optimum ph of  <dig> , whereas vhnag <dig> has a molecular mass of  <dig> kda and an optimum ph of  <dig> . the recombinant glcnacases were found to hydrolyze all the natural substrates, vhnag <dig> being ten-fold more active than vhnag <dig>  product analysis by tlc and quantitative hplc suggested that vhnag <dig> degraded chitooligosaccharides in a sequential manner, its highest activity being with chitotetraose. kinetic modeling of the enzymic reaction revealed that binding at subsites  and  had unfavorable  binding free energy changes and that the binding pocket of vhnag <dig> contains four glcnac binding subsites, designated ,,, and .


CONCLUSIONS
two novel glcnacases were identified as exolytic enzymes that degraded chitin oligosaccharides, releasing glcnac as the end product. in living cells, these intracellular enzymes may work after endolytic chitinases to complete chitin degradation. the availability of the two glcnacases, together with the previously-reported chitinase a from the same organism, suggests that a systematic development of the chitin-degrading enzymes may provide a valuable tool in commercial chitin bioconversion.
