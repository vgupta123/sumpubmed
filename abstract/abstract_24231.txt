BACKGROUND
to measure the impact of masticatory reduction on learning and memory, previous studies have produced experimental masticatory reduction by modified diet or molar removal. here we induced spatial learning impairment in mice by reducing masticatory activity and then tested the effect of a combination of environmental enrichment and masticatory rehabilitation in recovering spatial learning at adulthood and in later life. for  <dig> months  or  <dig> months , we fed three groups of mice from postnatal day  <dig> respectively with a hard diet  of pellets; pellets followed by a powdered, soft diet ; or pellets followed by powder, followed by pellets again . to mimic sedentary or active lifestyles, half of the animals from each group were raised from weaning in standard cages  and the other half in enriched cages . to evaluate spatial learning, we used the morris water maze.


RESULTS
ie6m-hd/sd mice showed lower learning rates compared with control  or masticatory rehabilitated  animals. similarly, ee-hd/sd mice independent of age showed lower performance than controls  or rehabilitated mice . however, combined rehabilitation and ee in aged mice improved learning rate up to control levels. learning rates did not correlate with swim speed.


CONCLUSIONS
reduction in masticatory activity imposed on mice previously fed a hard diet  impaired spatial learning in the morris water maze. in adults, masticatory rehabilitation recovered spatial abilities in both sedentary and active mice, and rehabilitation of masticatory activity combined with ee recovered these losses in aged mice.
