BACKGROUND
bacterial small regulatory rnas  play important roles in sensing environment changes through srna-target mrna interactions. however, the current strategy for detecting srna-mrna interactions usually combines bioinformatics prediction and experimental verification, which is hampered by low prediction accuracy and low-throughput. additionally, among the  <dig> sequenced bacterial genomes, only about  <dig> srnas from  <dig> strains have been described. furthermore, target mrnas of only  <dig> srnas have been uncovered. obviously, highly efficient methods were required to detect srna-mrna interactions in the sequenced genomes. this study aimed to apply a modified clash  method to detect rna-rna interactions in e. coli, a model bacterial organism.


RESULTS
statistically significant interactions were detected in  <dig> transcript pairs. to the best of our knowledge,  <dig> pairs were reported for the first time and were novel rna interactions, including trna-trna, trna-ncrna , trna-rrna, rrna-mrna, rrna-ncrna, rrna-rrna, rrna-igt , and trna-igt interactions.


CONCLUSIONS
discovery of novel rna-rna interactions in the present study demonstrates that rna-rna interactions might be far more complicated than ever expected. new methods may be required to help discover more novel rna-rna interactions. the present work describes a high-throughput protocol not only for discovering new rna interactions, but also directly obtaining base-pairing sequences, which should be useful in assessing rna structure and interactions.
