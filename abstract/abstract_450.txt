BACKGROUND
the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis is difficult because there are no specific clinical manifestations of the disease and colonization and infection are difficult to distinguish. in the last decade, much effort has been made to develop reliable tests for rapid diagnosis of invasive candidiasis, but none of them have found widespread clinical use.


RESULTS
antibodies against a recombinant n-terminal fragment of the candida albicans germ tube-specific antigen hyphal wall protein  <dig>  generated in escherichia coli were detected by both immunoblotting and elisa tests in a group of  <dig> hematological or intensive care unit patients with invasive candidiasis and in a group of  <dig> control patients at high risk for the mycosis who did not have clinical or microbiological data to document invasive candidiasis. results were compared with an immunofluorescence test to detect antibodies to c. albicans germ tubes . the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of a diagnostic test based on the detection of antibodies against the n-terminal fragment of hwp <dig> by immunoblotting were  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively. detection of antibodies to the n-terminal fragment of hwp <dig> by elisa increased the sensitivity  and the negative predictive value  but slightly decreased the specificity  and positive predictive values . the kinetics of antibody response to the n-terminal fragment of hwp <dig> by elisa was very similar to that observed by detecting antibodies to cagt.


CONCLUSIONS
an elisa test to detect antibodies against a recombinant n-terminal fragment of the c. albicans germ tube cell wall antigen hwp <dig> allows the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis with similar results to those obtained by detecting antibodies to cagt but without the need of treating the sera to adsorb the antibodies against the cell wall surface of the blastospore.
