BACKGROUND
although the fetal sheep is a favoured model for studying the ontogeny of physiological control systems, there are no descriptions of the timing of arrival of the projections of supraspinal origin that regulate somatic and visceral function. in the early development of birds and mammals, spontaneous motor activity is generated within spinal circuits, but as development proceeds, a distinct change occurs in spontaneous motor patterns that is dependent on the presence of intact, descending inputs to the spinal cord. in the fetal sheep, this change occurs at approximately  <dig> days gestation , so we therefore hypothesised that spinally-projecting axons from the neurons responsible for transforming fetal behaviour must arrive at the spinal cord level shortly before g <dig>  accordingly we aimed to identify the brainstem neurons that send projections to the spinal cord in the mature sheep fetus at g <dig>  with retrograde tracing, and thus to establish whether any projections from the brainstem were absent from the spinal cord at g <dig>  an age prior to the marked change in fetal motor activity has occurred.


RESULTS
at g <dig>  ctb labelled cells were found within and around nuclei in the reticular formation of the medulla and pons, within the vestibular nucleus, raphe complex, red nucleus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract. this pattern of labelling is similar to that previously reported in other species. the distribution of ctb labelled neurons in the g <dig> fetus was similar to that of the g <dig> fetus.


CONCLUSIONS
the brainstem nuclei that contain neurons which project axons to the spinal cord in the fetal sheep are the same as in other mammalian species. all projections present in the mature fetus at g <dig> have already arrived at the spinal cord by approximately one third of the way through gestation. the demonstration that the neurons responsible for transforming fetal behaviour in early ontogeny have already reached the spinal cord by g <dig>  an age well before the change in motor behaviour occurs, suggests that the projections do not become fully functional until well after their arrival at the spinal cord.
