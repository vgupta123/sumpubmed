BACKGROUND
mycobacterium tuberculosis beijing strains are characterized by a large number of is <dig> copies, suggesting the potential implication of this element in the virulence and capacity for rapid dissemination characteristic of this family. this work studies the insetion points of is <dig> in high-copy clinical isolates specifically focusing on the beijing genotype.


RESULTS
in the present work we mapped the insertion points of is <dig> in all the beijing strains available in the literature and in the dna sequence databases. we generated a representative primer collection of the is <dig> locations, which was used to analyse  <dig> high-copy clinical isolates. a total of  <dig> points of insertion were identified and analysis of their flanking regions determined the exact location, the direct repeats , the orientation and the distance to neighboring genes of each copy of is <dig>  we identified specific points of insertion in beijing strains that enabled us to obtain a dendrogram that groups the beijing genotype.


CONCLUSIONS
this work presents a detailed analysis of locations of is <dig> in high-copy clinical isolates, showing points of insertion present with high frequency in the beijing family and absent in other strains.
