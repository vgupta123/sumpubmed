BACKGROUND
taxol is an anti-cancer drug harvested from taxus trees, proposed ecologically to act as a fungicide. taxus is host to fungal endophytes, defined as organisms that inhabit plants without causing disease. the taxus endophytes have been shown to synthesize taxol in vitro, providing taxus with a second potential biosynthetic route for this protective metabolite. taxol levels in plants vary 125-fold between individual trees, but the underlying reason has remained unknown.


RESULTS
comparing taxus trees or branches within a tree, correlations were observed between taxol content, and quantity of its resident taxol-producing endophyte, paraconiothyrium ssm <dig>  depletion of fungal endophyte in planta by fungicide reduced plant taxol accumulation. fungicide treatment of intact plants caused concomitant decreases in transcript and/or protein levels corresponding to two critical genes required for plant taxol biosynthesis. taxol showed fungicidal activity against fungal pathogens of conifer wood, the natural habitat of the taxol-producing endophyte. consistent with other taxol-producing endophytes, ssm <dig> was resistant to taxol.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that the variation in taxol content between intact taxus plants and/or tissues is at least in part caused by varying degrees of transcriptional elicitation of plant taxol biosynthetic genes by its taxol-producing endophyte. as taxol is a fungicide, and the endophyte is resistant to taxol, we discuss how this endophyte strategy may be to prevent colonization by its fungal competitors but at minimal metabolic cost to itself.
