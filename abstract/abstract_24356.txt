BACKGROUND
the pkd family of serine/threonine kinases comprises a single member in drosophila , two isoforms in c. elegans  and three members, pkd <dig>  pkd <dig> and pkd <dig> in mammals. pkd <dig> and pkd <dig> have been the focus of most studies up to date, which implicate these enzymes in very diverse cellular functions, including golgi organization and plasma membrane directed transport, immune responses, apoptosis and cell proliferation. concerning pkd <dig>  a role in the formation of vesicular transport carriers at the trans-golgi network  and in basal glucose transport has been inferred from in vitro studies. so far, however, the physiological functions of the kinase during development remain unknown.


RESULTS
we have examined the expression pattern of pkd <dig> during the development of mouse embryos by immunohistochemistry. using a pkd <dig> specific antibody we demonstrate that the kinase is differentially expressed during organogenesis. in the developing heart a strong pkd <dig> expression is constantly detected from e <dig> to e <dig> . from e <dig>  on pkd <dig> is increasingly expressed in neuronal as well as in the supporting connective tissue and in skeletal muscles.


CONCLUSIONS
the data presented support an important role for pkd <dig> during development of these tissues.
