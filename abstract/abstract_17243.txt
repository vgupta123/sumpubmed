BACKGROUND
as the most abundant renewable resources, lignocellulosic materials are ideal candidates as alternative feedstock for bioethanol production. cassava residues  are byproducts of the cassava starch industry which can be mixed with lignocellulosic materials for ethanol production. the presence of lignin in lignocellulosic substrates can inhibit saccharification by reducing the cellulase activity. simultaneous saccharification and fermentation  of furfural residues  pretreated with green liquor and hydrogen peroxide  with cr saccharification liquid was investigated. the final ethanol concentration, yield, initial rate, number of live yeast cells, and the dead yeast ratio were compared to evaluate the effectiveness of combining delignificated lignocellulosic substrates and starchy substrates for ethanol production.


RESULTS
our results indicate that  <dig>  % of fr lignin removal was achieved on fr using of  <dig>  g h2o2/g-substrate and 9 ml gl/g-substrate at 80 °c. the highest overall ethanol yield was  <dig>  % of the theoretical. when the ratio of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr to cr was 5: <dig>  the ethanol concentration was the same with that ratio of untreated fr to cr of 1: <dig>  using  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr with cr at a ratio of 2: <dig> resulted in  <dig>  g/l ethanol concentration. moreover, fr pretreated with gl-h2o <dig> decreased the concentration of byproducts in ssf compared with that obtained in the previous study.


CONCLUSIONS
the lignin in fr would inhibit enzyme activity and gl-h2o <dig> is an advantageous pretreatment method to treat fr and high intensity of fr pretreatment increased the final ethanol concentration. the efficiency of ethanol fermentation of was improved when delignification increased. gl-h2o <dig> is an advantageous pretreatment method to treat fr. as the pretreatment dosage of gl-h2o <dig> on fr increased, the proportion of lignocellulosic substrates was enhanced in the ssf of the substrate mixture of cr and fr as compared with untreated fr. moreover, the final ethanol concentration was increased with a high ethanol yield and lower byproduct concentrations.
