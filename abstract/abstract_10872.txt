BACKGROUND
in addition to the regulation of blood pressure, α2- and β-adrenoceptor  subtypes play an important role in the modulation of noradrenergic neurotransmission in the human cns and pns. several studies suggest that the α2-ar responsiveness in cells and tissues after chronic epinephrine  or norepinephrine  exposure may vary, depending on the β-ar activity present there. recently, we reported that in be-c human neuroblastoma cells , chronic epi treatment  produced a dramatic β-adrenoceptor-dependent desensitization of the α2a-ar response. the aim of this study is to determine if stable addition of a β2-ar to a second neuroblastoma cell line , that normally expresses only α2a-ars that are not sensitive to  <dig> nm epi exposure, would suddenly render α2a-ars in that cell line sensitive to treatment with the same epi concentration.

methods
these studies employed rt-pcr, receptor binding and inhibition of camp accumulation to confirm α2-ar subtype expression. stable clones of sh-sy5y cells transfected to stably express functional β2-ars  were selected to compare sensitivity of α2-ar to epi in the presence or absence of β2-ars.


RESULTS
a series of molecular, biochemical and pharmacological studies indicated that the difference between the cell lines could not be attributed to α2-ar heterogeneity. we now report that after transfection of functional β2-ar into sh-sy5y cells , chronic treatment with modest levels of epi desensitizes the α2a-ar. this effect results from a β2-ar dependent down-regulation of native α2a-ars by epi accompanied by enhanced translocation of grk <dig> and grk <dig> to the membrane .


CONCLUSIONS
this study further supports the hypothesis that the presence of the β-ar renders the α2a-ar more susceptible to desensitization with physiological levels of epi.
