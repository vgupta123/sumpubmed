BACKGROUND
as a consequence of the increasing levels of anthelmintic resistance in cyathostomes, new strategies for equine parasite control are being implemented. to assess the potential risks of these, the occurrence of strongyles was evaluated in a group of  <dig> horses. the distribution of fecal egg counts , the frequency of anthelmintic drug use, and the deworming intervals were also analyzed. between june  <dig> and may  <dig>   <dig> fecal samples from either selectively or strategically dewormed horses were collected at  <dig> horse farms all over germany and analyzed quantitatively with a modified mcmaster technique. all samples with fec ≥ <dig> eggs per gram  were subjected to coproculture to generate third-stage larvae  for species differentiation.


RESULTS
egg counts were below the limit of detection  in  <dig>  samples and above it in  <dig>  samples. strongylus vulgaris larvae were identified in two of the  <dig> positive samples. infections with cyathostomes were found on every farm. the most frequently applied anthelmintic was ivermectin , followed by pyrantel . the mean time since last treatment was  <dig>  months. high-egg-shedding  strategically dewormed horses  were treated, on average, three times/year. the planned treatment date was already exceeded by  <dig> % of the high egg-shedders and by  <dig> % of the moderate  and low egg-shedders .


CONCLUSIONS
s. vulgaris seems to be rare in germany and no difference in its frequency has yet been found between selectively treated horses and horses receiving treatment in strategic intervals. however, inconsistent parasite control has been observed. therefore, to minimize the risks for disease, consistent and efficient parasite control should be implemented.
