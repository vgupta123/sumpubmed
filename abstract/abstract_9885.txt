BACKGROUND
evaluating patterns of genetic variation is important to identify conservation units  in endangered species. while neutral markers could be used to infer population history, their application in the estimation of adaptive variation is limited. the capacity to adapt to various environments is vital for the long-term survival of endangered species. hence, analysis of adaptive loci, such as the major histocompatibility complex  genes, is critical for conservation genetics studies. here, we investigated  <dig> classical mhc class i genes  and  <dig> microsatellites to infer patterns of genetic variation in the giant panda  and to further define conservation units.


RESULTS
overall, we identified  <dig> haplotypes  from  <dig> individuals obtained from  <dig> populations of giant panda. we found that the xiaoxiangling population had the highest genetic variation at microsatellites among the  <dig> giant panda populations and higher genetic variation at aime-mhc class i genes than other larger populations . differentiation index -based phylogenetic and bayesian clustering analyses for aime-mhc-i and microsatellite loci both supported that most populations were highly differentiated. the qinling population was the most genetically differentiated.


CONCLUSIONS
the giant panda showed a relatively higher level of genetic diversity at mhc class i genes compared with endangered felids. using all of the loci, we found that the  <dig> giant panda populations fell into  <dig> esus: qinling and non-qinling populations. we defined  <dig> mus based on microsatellites: qinling, minshan-qionglai, and daxiangling-xiaoxiangling-liangshan. we also recommended  <dig> possible aus based on mhc loci: qinling, minshan-qionglai, and daxiangling-xiaoxiangling-liangshan. furthermore, we recommend that a captive breeding program be considered for the qinling panda population.
