BACKGROUND
we propose a sequence clustering algorithm and compare the partition quality and execution time of the proposed algorithm with those of a popular existing algorithm. the proposed clustering algorithm uses a grammar-based distance metric to determine partitioning for a set of biological sequences. the algorithm performs clustering in which new sequences are compared with cluster-representative sequences to determine membership. if comparison fails to identify a suitable cluster, a new cluster is created.


RESULTS
the performance of the proposed algorithm is validated via comparison to the popular dna/rna sequence clustering approach, cd-hit-est, and to the recently developed algorithm, uclust, using two different sets of 16s rdna sequences from  <dig>  genera. the proposed algorithm maintains a comparable cpu execution time with that of cd-hit-est which is much slower than uclust, and has successfully generated clusters with higher statistical accuracy than both cd-hit-est and uclust. the validation results are especially striking for large datasets.


CONCLUSIONS
we introduce a fast and accurate clustering algorithm that relies on a grammar-based sequence distance. its statistical clustering quality is validated by clustering large datasets containing 16s rdna sequences.
