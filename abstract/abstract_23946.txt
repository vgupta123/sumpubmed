BACKGROUND
analysis of the plethora of metabolites found in the nmr spectra of biological fluids or tissues requires data complexity to be simplified. we present a graphical user interface  for nmr-based metabonomic analysis. the "metabonomic package" has been developed for metabonomics research as open-source software and uses the r statistical libraries.


RESULTS
the package offers the following options:

raw 1-dimensional spectra processing: phase, baseline correction and normalization.

importing processed spectra.

including/excluding spectral ranges, optional binning and bucketing, detection and alignment of peaks.

sorting of metabolites based on their ability to discriminate, metabolite selection, and outlier identification.

multivariate unsupervised analysis: principal components analysis .

multivariate supervised analysis: partial least squares , linear discriminant analysis , k-nearest neighbor classification.

neural networks.

visualization and overlapping of spectra.

plot values of the chemical shift position for different samples.

furthermore, the "metabonomic" gui includes a console to enable other kinds of analyses and to take advantage of all r statistical tools.


CONCLUSIONS
we made complex multivariate analysis user-friendly for both experienced and novice users, which could help to expand the use of nmr-based metabonomics.
