BACKGROUND
thousands of intragenic long interspersed element  <dig> sequences  reside within genes. these intragenic l <dig> sequences are conserved and regulate the expression of their host genes. when l <dig> methylation is decreased, either through chemical induction or in cancer, the intragenic l <dig> transcription is increased. the resulting l <dig> mrnas form risc complexes with pre-mrna to degrade the complementary mrna. in this study, we screened for genes that are involved in intragenic l <dig> regulation networks.


RESULTS
genes containing l1s were obtained from l1base . the expression profiles of  <dig> genes in  <dig> gene knockdown experiments were obtained from the gene expression omnibus  . the expression levels of the genes with and without l1s were compared using pearsonâ€™s chi-squared test. after a permutation based statistical analysis and a multiple hypothesis testing,  <dig> genes were found to induce significant regulatory changes  in genes with l1s. in detail,  <dig> genes were found to induce both the upregulation and downregulation of genes with l1s, whereas  <dig> and  <dig> genes induced the downregulation and upregulation, respectively, of genes with l1s. these regulations sometimes differed depending on the cell type and the orientation of the intragenic l1s. moreover, the sirna-regulating genes containing l1s possess a variety of molecular functions, are responsible for many cellular phenotypes and are associated with a number of diseases.


CONCLUSIONS
cells use intragenic l1s as cis-regulatory elements within gene bodies to modulate gene expression. there may be several mechanisms by which l1s mediate gene expression. intragenic l1s may be involved in the regulation of several biological processes, including dna damage and repair, inflammation, immune function, embryogenesis, cell differentiation, cellular response to external stimuli and hormonal responses. furthermore, in addition to cancer, intragenic l1s may alter gene expression in a variety of diseases and abnormalities.
