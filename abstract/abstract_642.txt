BACKGROUND
proper calving management of dairy herds is a crucial aspect of the bovine life cycle, as it has profound effects on calf viability and on the post-partum course of the dam. the objectives of this study were to monitor the calving process through the use of a remote alarm system and to determine the impact of prompt emergency obstetric procedures in case of dystocia for the prevention of stillbirths and post-partum reproductive pathologies, and for improving herd fertility. six groups of experimental animals were studied: monitored heifers  and multiparous cows  were compared with non-observed animals  giving birth during the same time period and housed in the calving barn, and with unmonitored animals placed in a dry zone .


RESULTS
the incidence of dystocia ranged from a minimum of  <dig> %  to a maximum of  <dig> % , and there were no differences compared with control groups. however, the rate of stillbirth was higher in control groups than in the monitored groups . among both heifers and multiparous cows, the incidence of post-partum uterine infections was higher in the unmonitored animals both in the calving barn  and in the dry zone  compared with monitored animals. among both heifers and multiparous cows, the control groups showed higher rates of foetal membrane retention than did the monitored groups . the calving-to-conception interval was shorter; in particular, observed heifers showed a significant advantage of approximately 46 days compared with the unmonitored group  and 32 days compared with the group in the calving barn . multiparous cows also had a reduction in the number of days open.


CONCLUSIONS
the remote alarm system used to monitor the calving process assured the prompt presence of personnel, improving both the cow’s reproductive efficiency and neonatal viability.
