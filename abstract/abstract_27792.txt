BACKGROUND
t-cell activation is an essential step of the immune response and relies on the tightly controlled orchestration of hundreds of genes/proteins, yet the cellular and molecular events underlying this complex process are not fully understood, especially at the genome-scale. significantly, a comparative genome-scale transcriptional analysis of two t-cell subsets  against each other and against the naturally mixed population  remains unexplored.


RESULTS
comparison of the microarray-based gene expression patterns between cd3+ t cells, and the cd4+ and cd8+ subsets revealed largely conserved, but not identical, transcriptional patterns. we employed a gene-ontology-driven transcriptional analysis coupled with protein abundance assays in order to identify novel t-cell activation genes and cell-type-specific genes associated with the immune response. we identified potential genes involved in the communication between the two subsets  and would-be effector-function-specific genes . chemokines induced during t-cell activation, but not previously identified in t cells, include ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> , and xcl <dig> . increased expression of other unexpected cytokines  suggests their involvement in t-cell activation with their functions yet to be examined. differential expression of many receptors, not previously reported in the context of t-cell activation, including ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  il1r <dig>  il1rap, il6r, tnfrsf <dig> and tnfrsf1a, suggests their role in this immune process. several receptors involved in tcr activation  along with lck, zap <dig> and tyrobp were synchronously downregulated. members of cell-surface receptors , none previously identified in the context of t-cell activation, were also downregulated.


CONCLUSIONS
this comparative genome-scale, transcriptional analysis of t-cell activation in the cd4+ and cd8+ subsets and the mixed cd3+ populations made possible the identification of many immune-response genes not previously identified in the context of t-cell activation. significantly, it made possible to identify the temporal patterns of many previously known t-cell activation genes, and also identify genes implicated in effector functions of and communication between cd4+ and cd8+ t cells.
