BACKGROUND
the moss physcomitrella patens contains c18- as well as c20-polyunsaturated fatty acids that can be metabolized by different enzymes to form oxylipins such as the cyclopentenone cis-12-oxo phytodienoic acid. mutants defective in the biosynthesis of cyclopentenones showed reduced fertility, aberrant sporophyte morphology and interrupted sporogenesis. the initial step in this biosynthetic route is the conversion of a fatty acid hydroperoxide to an allene oxide. this reaction is catalyzed by allene oxide synthase  belonging as hydroperoxide lyase  to the cytochrome p <dig> family cyp <dig>  in this study we characterized two aos from p. patens, ppaos <dig> and ppaos <dig> 


RESULTS
our results show that ppaos <dig> is highly active with both c <dig> and c20-hydroperoxy-fatty acid substrates, whereas ppaos <dig> is fully active only with c20-substrates, exhibiting trace activity  with c <dig> substrates. analysis of products of ppaos <dig> and pphpl further demonstrated that both enzymes have an inherent side activity mirroring the close inter-connection of aos and hpl catalysis. by employing site directed mutagenesis we provide evidence that single amino acid residues in the active site are also determining the catalytic activity of a 9-/13-aos â€“ a finding that previously has only been reported for substrate specific 13-aos. however, pphpl cannot be converted into an aos by exchanging the same determinant. localization studies using yfp-labeled aos showed that ppaos <dig> is localized in the plastid while ppaos <dig> may be found in the cytosol. analysis of the wound-induced cis-12-oxo phytodienoic acid accumulation in ppaos <dig> and ppaos <dig> single knock-out mutants showed that disruption of ppaos <dig>  in contrast to ppaos <dig>  results in a significantly decreased cis-12-oxo phytodienoic acid formation. however, the knock-out mutants of neither ppaos <dig> nor ppaos <dig> showed reduced fertility, aberrant sporophyte morphology or interrupted sporogenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
our study highlights five findings regarding the oxylipin metabolism in p. patens:  both aos isoforms are capable of metabolizing c18- and c20-derived substrates with different specificities suggesting that both enzymes might have different functions.  site directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the catalytic trajectories of 9-/13-ppaos <dig> and pphpl are closely inter-connected and ppaos <dig> can be inter-converted by a single amino acid exchange into a hpl.  in contrast to ppaos <dig>  ppaos <dig> is localized in the plastid where oxylipin metabolism takes place.  ppaos <dig> is essential for wound-induced accumulation of cis-12-oxo phytodienoic acid while ppaos <dig> appears not to be involved in the process.  knock-out mutants of neither aos showed a deviating morphological phenotype suggesting that there are overlapping functions with other cyp <dig> enzymes.
