BACKGROUND
the synthesis of information across microarray studies has been performed by combining statistical results of individual studies , or by combining data from multiple studies into a large pool to be analyzed as a single data set . specific issues relating to data heterogeneity across microarray studies, such as differences within and between labs or differences among experimental conditions, could lead to equivocal results in a melting pot approach.


RESULTS
we applied statistical theory to determine the specific effect of different means and heteroskedasticity across  <dig> groups of microarray data on the sign and magnitude of gene-to-gene pearson correlation coefficients obtained from the pool of  <dig> groups. we quantified the biases of the pooled coefficients and compared them to the biases of correlations estimated by an effect-size model. mean differences across the  <dig> groups were the main factor determining the magnitude and sign of the pooled coefficients, which showed largest values of bias as they approached ± <dig>  only heteroskedasticity across the pool of  <dig> groups resulted in less efficient estimations of correlations than did a classical meta-analysis approach of combining correlation coefficients. these results were corroborated by simulation studies involving either mean differences or heteroskedasticity across a pool of n >  <dig> groups.


CONCLUSIONS
the combination of statistical results is best suited for synthesizing the correlation between expression profiles of a gene pair across several microarray studies.
