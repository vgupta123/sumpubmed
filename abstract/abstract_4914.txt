BACKGROUND
since the single nucleotide polymorphisms  are genetic variations which determine the difference between any two unrelated individuals, the snps can be used to identify the correct source population of an individual. for efficient population identification with the hapmap genotype data, as few informative snps as possible are required from the original  <dig> million snps. recently, park et al.  adopted the nearest shrunken centroid method to classify the three populations, i.e., utah residents with ancestry from northern and western europe , yoruba in ibadan, nigeria in west africa , and han chinese in beijing together with japanese in tokyo , from which  <dig>  snps were obtained and the top  <dig> snps could completely classify the three populations.


RESULTS
in this paper, we propose to first rank each feature  using a ranking measure, i.e., a modified t-test or f-statistics. then from the ranking list, we form different feature subsets by sequentially choosing different numbers of features  with top ranking values, train and test them by a classifier, e.g., the support vector machine , thereby finding one subset which has the highest classification accuracy. compared to the classification method of park et al., we obtain a better result, i.e., good classification of the  <dig> populations using on average  <dig> snps.


CONCLUSIONS
experimental results show that the both of the modified t-test and f-statistics method are very effective in ranking snps about their classification capabilities. combined with the svm classifier, a desirable feature subset  can be quickly found in the greedy manner after ranking all snps. our method is able to identify a very small number of important snps that can determine the populations of individuals.
