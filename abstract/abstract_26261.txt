BACKGROUND
there is a great interest in studying phosphotyrosine dependent protein-protein interactions in tyrosine kinase pathways that play a critical role in many aspects of cellular function. we previously established sh <dig> profiling, a phosphoproteomic approach based on membrane binding assays that utilizes purified src homology  <dig>  domains as a molecular tool to profile the global tyrosine phosphorylation state of cells. however, in order to use this method to investigate sh <dig> binding sites on a specific target in cell lysate, additional procedures such as pull-down or immunoprecipitation which consume large amounts of sample are required.


RESULTS
we have developed pla-sh <dig>  an alternative in-solution modular domain binding assay that takes advantage of proximity ligation assay and real-time pcr. the sh2-pla assay utilizes oligonucleotide-conjugated anti-gst and anti-egfr antibodies recognizing a gst-sh <dig> probe and cellular egfr, respectively. if the gst-sh <dig> and egfr are in close proximity as a result of sh2-phosphotyrosine interactions, the two oligonucleotides are brought within a suitable distance for ligation to occur, allowing for efficient complex amplification via real-time pcr. the assay detected signal across at least  <dig> orders of magnitude of lysate input with a linear range spanning 1– <dig> orders and a low femtomole limit of detection for egfr phosphotyrosine. sh <dig> binding kinetics determined by pla-sh <dig> showed good agreement with established far-western analyses for a <dig> and cos <dig> cells stimulated with egf at various times and doses. further, we showed that pla-sh <dig> can survey lung cancer tissues using 1 μl lysate without requiring phospho-enrichment.


CONCLUSIONS
we showed for the first time that interactions between sh <dig> domain probes and egfr in cell lysate can be determined in a microliter-scale assay using sh2-pla. the obvious benefit of this method is that the low sample requirement allows detection of sh <dig> binding in samples which are difficult to analyze using traditional protein interaction assays. this feature along with short assay runtime makes this method a useful platform for the development of high throughput assays to determine modular domain–ligand interactions which could have wide-ranging applications in both basic and translational cancer research.
