BACKGROUND
the trypanosoma brucei cell cycle is regulated by combinations of cyclin/crks . recently, two additional cyclins  and six new crk  homologues were identified in the t. brucei genome database  <cit> .


RESULTS
individual rnai knockdowns of these new proteins in the procyclic form of t. brucei showed no apparent phenotype except for the crk <dig> depletion, which enriched the cells in g2/m phase. but a similar crk <dig> knockdown in the bloodstream form caused no apparent phenotype. crk <dig> lacks the typical pstaire motif for cyclin binding and the phenylalanine "gatekeeper" but binds to cyclin b <dig> in vitro and localizes to the nucleus in both forms of t. brucei. crk9-depleted procyclic-form generated no detectable anucleate cells, suggesting an inhibition of cytokinesis by crk <dig> depletion as well. the knockdown enriched cells with one nucleus, one kinetoplast and two closely associated basal bodies with an average distance of  <dig>  mm in between, which was shorter than the control value of  <dig>  Î¼m, and the cells became morphologically deformed and rounded with time.


CONCLUSIONS
crk <dig> may play a role in mediating the segregation between the two kinetoplast/basal body pairs prior to cytokinetic initiation. since such a segregation over a relatively significant distance is essential for cytokinetic initiation only in the procyclic but may not be in the bloodstream form, crk <dig> could be specifically involved in regulating cytokinetic initiation in the procyclic form of t. brucei.
