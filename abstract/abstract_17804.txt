BACKGROUND
nelore is the major beef cattle breed in brazil with more than  <dig> million heads. genome-wide association studies  are often used to associate markers and genomic regions to growth and meat quality traits that can be used to assist selection programs. an alternative methodology to traditional gwas that involves the construction of gene network interactions, derived from results of several gwas is the awm /pcit . with the aim of evaluating the genetic architecture of brazilian nelore cattle, we used high-density snp genotyping data  from  <dig> nelore animals comprising  <dig> half-sibling families derived from highly disseminated and unrelated sires from across brazil. the awm/pcit methodology was employed to evaluate the genes that participate in a series of eight phenotypes related to growth and meat quality obtained from this nelore sample.


RESULTS
our results indicate a lack of structuring between the individuals studied since principal component analyses were not able to differentiate families by its sires or by its ancestral lineages. the application of the awm/pcit methodology revealed a trio of transcription factors  which in combination connected  <dig> genes through  <dig> edges and whose biological functions were inspected, some revealing to participate in biological growth processes in literature searches.


CONCLUSIONS
the diversity of the nelore sample studied is not high enough to differentiate among families neither by sires nor by using the available ancestral lineage information. the gene networks constructed from the awm/pcit methodology were a useful alternative in characterizing genes and gene networks that were allegedly influential in growth and meat quality traits in nelore cattle.
