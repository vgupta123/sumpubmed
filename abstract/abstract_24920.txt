BACKGROUND
vertebrate development relies on the regulated translation of stored maternal mrnas, but how these regulatory mechanisms may have evolved to control translational efficiency of individual mrnas is poorly understood. we compared the translational regulation and polyadenylation of the cyclin b <dig> mrna during zebrafish and xenopus oocyte maturation. polyadenylation and translational activation of cyclin b <dig> mrna is well characterized during xenopus oocyte maturation. specifically, xenopus cyclin b <dig> mrna is polyadenylated and translationally activated during oocyte maturation by proteins that recognize the conserved aauaaa hexanucleotide and u-rich cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements  within cyclin b <dig> mrna's 3'untranslated region .


RESULTS
the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna was polyadenylated during zebrafish oocyte maturation. furthermore, the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna's 3'utr was sufficient to stimulate translation of a reporter mrna during zebrafish oocyte maturation. this stimulation required both aauaaa and u-rich cpe-like sequences. however, in contrast to aauaaa, the positions and sequences of the functionally defined cpes were poorly conserved between xenopus and zebrafish cyclin b <dig> mrna 3'utrs. to determine whether these differences were relevant to translation efficiency, we analyzed the translational activity of reporter mrnas containing either the zebrafish or xenopus cyclin b <dig> mrna 3'utrs during both zebrafish and xenopus oocyte maturation. the zebrafish cyclin b <dig> 3'utr was quantitatively less effective at stimulating polyadenylation and translation compared to the xenopus cyclin b <dig> 3'utr during both zebrafish and xenopus oocyte maturation.


CONCLUSIONS
although the factors that regulate translation of maternal mrnas are highly conserved, the target sequences and overall sequence architecture within the 3'utr of the cyclin b <dig> mrna have diverged to affect translational efficiency, perhaps to optimize levels of cyclin b <dig> protein required by these different species during their earliest embryonic cell divisions.
