BACKGROUND
hepcidin/leap- <dig> is an iron regulatory hormone originally identified as an antimicrobial peptide. as part of a systematic analysis of the evolution of host defense peptides in primates, we have sequenced the orthologous gene from  <dig> species of non-human primates.


RESULTS
the sequence of the mature peptide is highly conserved amongst all the analyzed species, being identical to the human one in great apes and gibbons, with a single residue conservative variation in old-world monkeys and with few substitutions in new-world monkeys.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis indicates that hepcidin's role as a regulatory hormone, which involves interaction with a conserved receptor , may result in conservation over most of its sequence, with the exception of the stretch between residues  <dig> and  <dig>  which in new-world monkeys  shows a significant variation, possibly indicating that this structural region is involved in other functions.
