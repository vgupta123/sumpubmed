BACKGROUND
dengue viruses  are one of the most important viral diseases in the world with approximately  <dig> million infections and  <dig>  deaths each year. the current lack of an approved tetravalent vaccine and ineffective insecticide control measures warrant a search for alternatives to effectively combat denv. the trans-splicing variant of the tetrahymena thermophila group i intron catalytic rna, or ribozyme, is a powerful tool for post-transcriptional rna modification. the nature of the ribozyme and the predictability with which it can be directed makes it a powerful tool for modifying rna in nearly any cell type without the need for genome-altering gene therapy techniques or dependence on native cofactors.


RESULTS
several anti-denv group i trans-splicing introns  were designed and tested for their ability to target denv- <dig> ngc genomes in situ. we have successfully targeted two different uracil bases on the positive sense genomic strand within the highly conserved 5'-3' cyclization sequence  region common to all serotypes of denv with our αdenv-grpis. our ribozymes have demonstrated ability to specifically trans-splice a new rna sequence downstream of the targeted site in vitro and in transfected insect cells as analyzed by firefly luciferase and rt-pcr assays. the effectiveness of these αdenv-grpis to target infecting denv genomes is also validated in transfected or transformed aedes mosquito cell lines upon infection with unattenuated denv- <dig> ngc.


CONCLUSIONS
analysis shows that our αdenv-grpis have the ability to effectively trans-splice the denv genome in situ. notably, these results show that the αdenv-grpi 9v <dig>  designed to be active against all forms of dengue virus, effectively targeted the denv- <dig> ngc genome in a sequence specific manner. these novel αdenv-grpi introns provide a striking alternative to other rna based approaches for the transgenic suppression of denv in transformed mosquito cells and tissues.
