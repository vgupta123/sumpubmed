BACKGROUND
the y-chromosome haplogroup q has three major branches: q <dig>  q <dig>  and q <dig>  q <dig> is found in both asia and the americas where it accounts for about 90% of indigenous native american y-chromosomes; q <dig> is found in north and central asia; but little is known about the third branch, q <dig>  also named q1b-l <dig>  here, we combined the efforts of population geneticists and genetic genealogists to use the potential of full y-chromosome sequencing for reconstructing haplogroup q <dig> phylogeography and suggest possible linkages to events in population history.


RESULTS
we analyzed  <dig> fully sequenced y-chromosomes and reconstructed the haplogroup q <dig> phylogenetic tree in detail. haplogroup q3-l <dig>  derived from the oldest known split within eurasian/american haplogroup q, most likely occurred in west or central asia in the upper paleolithic period. during the mesolithic and neolithic epochs, q <dig> remained a minor component of the west asian y-chromosome pool and gave rise to five branches , which spread across west, central and parts of south asia. around 3– <dig> millennia ago , the q3a branch underwent a rapid expansion, splitting into seven branches, some of which entered europe. one of these branches, q3a <dig>  was acquired by a population ancestral to ashkenazi jews and grew within this population during the 1st millennium ad, reaching up to 5% in present day ashkenazi.


CONCLUSIONS
this study dataset was generated by a massive y-chromosome genotyping effort in the genetic genealogy community, and phylogeographic patterns were revealed by a collaboration of population geneticists and genetic genealogists. this positive experience of collaboration between academic and citizen science provides a model for further joint projects. merging data and skills of academic and citizen science promises to combine, respectively, quality and quantity, generalization and specialization, and achieve a well-balanced and careful interpretation of the paternal-side history of human populations.
