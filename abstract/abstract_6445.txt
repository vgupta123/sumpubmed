BACKGROUND
rna-binding motif protein  <dig>  is a conserved nucleolar protein containing  <dig> conserved rna recognition motifs. its biochemical function is to process rrna for ribosome biogenesis, and it has been shown to play a role in digestive organ development in zebrafish. here we analyzed the role of rbm <dig> during mouse embryonic development by generating mice containing a mutation in the rbm <dig> locus via gene-trap insertion.


RESULTS
homozygous mutant embryos failed to develop beyond the morula stage, showing defective nucleologenesis, activation of apoptosis, and upregulation of p <dig> target genes. a unique feature of rbm <dig> is its localization to the cytoplasm in morula stage-embryos, whereas most other nucleolar proteins are localized to the nucleolar precursor body . the nucleoli in the rbm <dig> mutant embryos remain immature, yet they can carry out rrna synthesis. the timing of developmental arrest occurs after expression of the inner cell mass markers oct3/ <dig> and nanog, but prior to the specification of trophectoderm as reflected by cdx <dig> expression.


CONCLUSIONS
the data indicate that rbm <dig> is essential for preimplantation development, highlighting the importance of de novo nucleologenesis during this critical developmental stage.
