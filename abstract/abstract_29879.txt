BACKGROUND
chromium is a transition metal most commonly found in the environment in its trivalent  and hexavalent  forms. the epa maximum total chromium contaminant level for drinking water is  <dig>  mg/l . many water sources, especially underground sources, are at low temperatures  year round. it is important to evaluate the possibility of microbial remediation of cr contamination using microorganisms adapted to these low temperatures .


RESULTS
core samples obtained from a cr contaminated aquifer at the hanford facility in washington were enriched in vogel bonner medium at  <dig> centigrade with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mg/l cr. the extent of cr reduction was evaluated using the diphenyl carbazide assay. resistance to cr up to and including  <dig> mg/l cr was observed in the consortium experiments. reduction was slow or not observed at and above  <dig> mg/l cr using the enrichment consortium. average time to complete reduction of cr in the  <dig> and  <dig> mg/l cr cultures of the consortium was  <dig> and  <dig> days, respectively at  <dig> centigrade. lyophilized consortium cells did not demonstrate adsorption of cr over a  <dig> hour period. successful isolation of a cr reducing organism  from the consortium was confirmed by 16s rdna amplification and sequencing. average time to complete reduction of cr at  <dig> centigrade in the  <dig> and  <dig> mg/l cr cultures of the isolate p <dig> was  <dig> and  <dig> days, respectively. the 16s rdna sequence from isolate p <dig> identified this organism as a strain of arthrobacter aurescens, a species that has not previously been shown to be capable of low temperature cr reduction.


CONCLUSIONS
a. aurescens, indigenous to the subsurface, has the potential to be a predominant metal reducer in enhanced, in situ subsurface bioremediation efforts involving cr and possibly other heavy metals and radionuclides.
