BACKGROUND
for immune monitoring studies during hiv vaccine clinical trials, whole blood specimens from hiv seropositive  patients may be collected at multiple sites and sent to a central location for peripheral blood mononuclear cell  isolation, cryopreservation and functional evaluation. in this study we show a comparison of two pbmc preparation options, ficoll density gradient separation  and cell preparation tubes  using shipped whole blood specimens from  <dig> hiv+ patients . the pre- and post- cryopreservation performance of samples collected by these two methods were compared by assessment of antigen-specific ifnγ expression in cd8+ and cd8- t cells, cellular viability, and cellular recovery.


RESULTS
the results indicate that cryopreserved pbmc samples tested for cmv- and hiv- specific interferon-gamma  expression performed equivalent to the respective fresh pbmc processed under both collection conditions. compared to fresh pbmc, the viability was significantly lower for cryopreserved pbmc derived using ficoll, although it was never less than 90%. there were no significant differences in the ifnγ response, viability, or recovery between cryopreserved pbmc derived by ficoll and by cpt.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that cpt is an efficient system for the collection and cryopreservation of functionally active hiv+ pbmc, as well as a viable alternative to ficoll gradient separation.
