BACKGROUND
species coexistence in mosquito assemblages may depend on mechanisms related to interspecific resource partitioning occurring at multiple scales. in the present work we investigated co-occurrence or spatial segregation in mosquito assemblages sharing resources at micro-habitat, habitat and landscape scales. environmental characteristics, mosquito fauna as adults and larvae were assessed along vegetation gradient in a natural landscape of tropical rainforest. huisman-olff-fresco  and generalized additive  models were employed to explore relationships between abundances of potential competitors in mosquito assemblages and vegetation gradient . we tested hypotheses concerning mosquito species co-occurrence or spatial segregation employing binomial logistic regression models.


RESULTS
co-occurrences and spatial segregation of mosquito species showed evidences of three scales of coexistence mechanisms: 1) micro-habitat - scale 1: different behaviors in response to food availability in specific vertical strata within larval container; 2) habitat - scale 2: specialized strategies related to heterogeneity of resource availability among larval containers and 3) landscape - scale 3: asymmetrical competition dependent upon the context of abiotic and biotic variables.


CONCLUSIONS
results of the present work suggest that coexistence mechanisms can concomitantly work at multiple scales.
