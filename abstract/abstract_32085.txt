BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile can cause antibiotic-associated diarrhea and a possibility of outbreaks in hospital settings warrants molecular typing. a microarray was designed that included toxin genes , genes related to antimicrobial resistance, the slpa gene and additional variable genes.


RESULTS
dna of six reference strains and  <dig> clinical isolates from south-western and eastern germany was subjected to linear amplification and labeling with dutp-linked biotin. amplicons were hybridized to microarrays providing information on the presence of target genes and on their alleles. tested isolates were assigned to  <dig> distinct profiles that clustered mainly according to mlst-defined clades. three additional profiles were predicted from published genome sequences, although they were not found experimentally.


CONCLUSIONS
the microarray based assay allows rapid and high-throughput genotyping of clinical c. difficile isolates including toxin gene detection and strain assignment. overall hybridization profiles correlated with mlst-derived clades.
