BACKGROUND
as the error rate is high and the distribution of errors across sites is non-uniform in next generation sequencing  data, it has been a challenge to estimate dna polymorphism  accurately from ngs data.


RESULTS
by computer simulations, we compare the two methods of data acquisition - sequencing each diploid individual separately and sequencing the pooled sample. under the current ngs error rate, sequencing each individual separately offers little advantage unless the coverage per individual is high . we hence propose a new method for estimating θ from pooled samples that have been subjected to two separate rounds of dna sequencing. since errors from the two sequencing applications are usually non-overlapping, it is possible to separate low frequency polymorphisms from sequencing errors. simulation results show that the dual applications method is reliable even when the error rate is high and θ is low.


CONCLUSIONS
in studies of natural populations where the sequencing coverage is usually modest , the dual applications method on pooled samples should be a reasonable choice.
