BACKGROUND
as individual naïve cd <dig> t lymphocytes circulate in the body after emerging from the thymus, they are likely to have individually varying microenvironmental interactions even in the absence of stimulation via specific target recognition. it is not clear if these interactions result in alterations in their activation, survival and effector programming. naïve cd <dig> t cells show unimodal distribution for many phenotypic properties, suggesting that the variation is caused by intrinsic stochasticity, although underlying variation due to subsets created by different histories of microenvironmental interactions remains possible. to explore this possibility, we began examining the phenotype and functionality of naïve cd <dig> t cells differing in a basic unimodally distributed property, the cd <dig> levels, as well as the causal origin of these differences.


RESULTS
we examined separated cd4hi and cd4lo subsets of mouse naïve cd <dig> cells. cd4lo cells were smaller with higher cd <dig> levels and lower levels of the dual-specific phosphatase 6-suppressing micro-rna mir181a, and responded poorly with more th2-skewed outcomes. human naïve cd4lo and cd4hi cells showed similar differences. naïve cd4lo and cd4hi subsets of thymic single-positive cd <dig> t cells did not show differences whereas peripheral naïve cd4lo and cd4hi subsets of t cell receptor -transgenic t cells did. adoptive transfer-mediated parking of naïve cd <dig> cells in vivo lowered cd <dig> levels, increased cd <dig> and reactive oxygen species  levels and induced hyporesponsiveness in them, dependent, at least in part, on availability of major histocompatibility complex class ii  molecules. ros scavenging or dusp inhibition ameliorated hyporesponsiveness. naïve cd <dig> cells from aged mice showed lower cd <dig> levels and cell sizes, higher cd <dig> levels, and hyporesponsiveness and th2-skewing reversed by dusp inhibition.


CONCLUSIONS
our data show that, underlying a unimodally distributed property, the cd <dig> level, there are subsets of naïve cd <dig> cells that vary in the time spent in the periphery receiving mhcii-mediated signals and show resultant alteration of phenotype and functionality via ros and dusp activity. our findings also suggest the feasibility of potential pharmacological interventions for improved cd <dig> t cell responses during vaccination of older people via either anti-oxidant or dusp inhibitor small molecules.
