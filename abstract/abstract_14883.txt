BACKGROUND
arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi  are important symbionts of most plant species, promoting plant diversity and productivity. this symbiosis is thought to have contributed to the early colonisation of land by plants. morphological stasis over  <dig> million years and the lack of an observed sexual stage in any member of the phylum glomeromycota led to the controversial suggestion of amf being ancients asexuals. evidence for recombination in amf is contradictory.


RESULTS
we addressed the question of recombination in the amf glomus intraradices by sequencing  <dig> polymorphic nuclear loci in  <dig> morphologically identical isolates from one field. phylogenetic relationships among genotypes showed a reticulate network pattern providing a rationale to test for recombination. five statistical tests predicted multiple recombinant regions in the genome of a core set of isolates. in contrast, five clonal lineages had fixed a large number of differences.


CONCLUSIONS
our data show that amf from one field have undergone recombination but that clonal lineages coexist. this finding has important consequences for understanding amf evolution, co-evolution of amf and plants and highlights the potential for commercially introduced amf inoculum recombining with existing local populations. finally, our results reconcile seemingly contradictory studies on whether amf are clonal or form recombining populations.
