BACKGROUND
genomic and transcriptomic sequence data are essential tools for tackling ecological problems. using an approach that combines next-generation sequencing, de novo transcriptome assembly, gene annotation and synthetic gene construction, we identify and cluster the protein families from favia corals from the northern red sea.


RESULTS
we obtained  <dig> million  <dig> bp paired-end cdna reads from two favia adult samples collected at  <dig> m  on the illumina ga platform, and generated two de novo assemblies using abyss and cap <dig>  after removing redundancy and filtering out low quality reads, our transcriptome datasets contained  <dig>   and  <dig>   contigs longer than  <dig> bp, with n <dig> values of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. using the proteome of the sea anemone nematostella vectensis as a reference, we were able to annotate almost 20% of each dataset using reciprocal homology searches. homologous clustering of these annotated transcripts allowed us to divide them into  <dig>   and  <dig>   homologous transcript clusters . functional annotation categories were assigned to homologous clusters using the functional annotation of nematostella vectensis. general annotation of the assembled transcripts was improved 1-3% using the acropora digitifera proteome. in addition, we screened these transcript isoform clusters for fluorescent proteins  homologs and identified seven potential fp homologs in fav <dig>  and four in fav <dig>  these transcripts were validated as bona fide fp transcripts via robust fluorescence heterologous expression. annotation of the assembled contigs revealed that  <dig> % and  <dig> %  of the total assembled contigs likely originated from the coralsâ€™ algal symbiont, symbiodinium spp.


CONCLUSIONS
here we present a study to identify the homologous transcript isoform clusters from the transcriptome of favia corals using a far-related reference proteome. furthermore, the symbiont-derived transcripts were isolated from the datasets and their contribution quantified. this is the first annotated transcriptome of the genus favia, a major increase in genomics resources available in this important family of corals.
