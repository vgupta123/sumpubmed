BACKGROUND
previous investigation has demonstrated that cd4+ t cells play a crucial role in effective immunity against helicobacter pylori  infection. it has been well proved that lpp <dig> is one of major protective antigens that induce immune responses after h.pylori invades host. therefore it is valuable to identify cd4+ t cell epitopes on lpp <dig>  which is uncharacterized.

methods
putative epitopes of h-2d restricted cd4+ t cell on lpp <dig> of h.pylori were predicted by the syfpeithi algorithm and then eight hypothetical epitope peptides were synthesized. after balb/c mice were primed with recombinant lpp <dig>  splenic cd4+ t cells were isolated and stimulated with synthesized peptides to measure t cell proliferation and mhc restriction. cytokine profile was determined by elisa and real-time pcr. two identified epitopes were used to immunize mice to investigate cd4+ t cell response by flow cytometry.


RESULTS
two of eight peptides were able to stimulate cd4+ t cell proliferation and were mapped to residues 83-97aa and 58-72aa on lpp <dig> respectively. these two peptides additively stimulated th <dig> cells to secrete ifn-Î³. the percentage of cd4+ t cell from mice immunized with two identified epitopes respectively was higher than the control group.


CONCLUSIONS
the identification and characterization of two cd4+ t cell epitopes of lpp <dig> helps understand the protective immunity of lpp <dig> in h.pylori infection and design effective epitope vaccines against h.pylori.
