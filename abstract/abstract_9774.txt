BACKGROUND
tomato spotted wilt virus  has a very wide host range, and is transmitted in a persistent manner by several species of thrips. these characteristics make this virus difficult to control. we show here that the over-expression of the mitochondrial alternative oxidase  in tomato and petunia is related to tswv resistance.


RESULTS
the open reading frame and full-length sequence of the tomato aox gene leaox1au were cloned and introduced into tomato 'healani' and petunia 'sheer madness' using agrobacterium-mediated transformation. highly expressed aox transgenic tomato and petunia plants were selfed and transgenic r <dig> seedlings from  <dig> tomato lines and  <dig> petunia lines were used for bioassay. for each assayed line,  <dig> to  <dig> tomato r <dig> progeny in three replications and  <dig> to  <dig> petunia progeny in  <dig> replications were challenged with tswv. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays showed that the tswv levels in transgenic tomato line fkt4- <dig> was significantly lower than that of wild-type controls after challenge with tswv. in addition, transgenic petunia line fkp <dig> showed significantly less lesion number and smaller lesion size than non-transgenic controls after inoculation by tswv.


CONCLUSIONS
in all assayed transgenic tomato lines, a higher percentage of transgenic progeny had lower tswv levels than non-transgenic plants after challenge with tswv, and the significantly increased resistant levels of tomato and petunia lines identified in this study indicate that altered expression levels of aox in tomato and petunia can affect the levels of tswv resistance.
