BACKGROUND
sharing of microarray data within the research community has been greatly facilitated by the development of the disclosure and communication standards miame and mage-ml by the mged society. however, the complexity of the mage-ml format has made its use impractical for laboratories lacking dedicated bioinformatics support.


RESULTS
we propose a simple tab-delimited, spreadsheet-based format, mage-tab, which will become a part of the mage microarray data standard and can be used for annotating and communicating microarray data in a miame compliant fashion.


CONCLUSIONS
mage-tab will enable laboratories without bioinformatics experience or support to manage, exchange and submit well-annotated microarray data in a standard format using a spreadsheet. the mage-tab format is self-contained, and does not require an understanding of mage-ml or xml.
