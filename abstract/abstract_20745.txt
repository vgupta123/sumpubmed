BACKGROUND
loss of function in genes required for telomere maintenance result in disorders known as telomeropathies, which are characterized by a pattern of symptoms including generalized and specific lymphocytopenias as well as very short telomere length and disease anticipation.

methods
because human larp <dig> is the most likely ortholog of the tetrahymena p <dig> protein, which is required for telomerase activity in that organism, we investigated the effects of larp <dig> silencing in human cells as well as in two distinct families with alazami syndrome .


RESULTS
depletion of larp <dig> caused a reduction in telomerase enzymatic activity and progressively shorter telomeres in human cancer cell lines. alazami syndrome patients from two separate cohorts exhibited very short lymphocyte telomeres. further, wild-type offspring of larp <dig> mutant individuals also had very short telomeres, comparable to what is observed in telomerase  mutant cohorts.


CONCLUSIONS
together, these experiments demonstrate that in addition to the readily apparent developmental disorder associated with larp <dig> deficiency, an underlying telomeropathy exists even in unaffected siblings of these individuals.
