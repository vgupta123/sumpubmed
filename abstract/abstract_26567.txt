BACKGROUND
vertebrate mitogenomes are economically organized and usually lack intergenic sequences other than the control region. intergenic spacers located between the trnathr and trnapro genes  have been observed in several taxa, including gadiform species, but information about their biological roles and putative functions is still lacking.


RESULTS
sequence characterization of the complete european hake merluccius merluccius mitogenome identified a complex t-p spacer ranging in size from 223–532 bp. further analyses of  <dig> gadiform species, representing  <dig> families and  <dig> genera, revealed the evolutionary preserved presence of t-p spacers across all taxa. molecular complexity of the t-p spacers was found to be coherent with the phylogenetic relationships, supporting a common ancestral origin and gain of function during codfish evolution. intraspecific variation of t-p spacer sequences was assessed in  <dig> atlantic cod specimens and revealed  <dig> haplotypes. pyrosequencing data representing the mito-transcriptome poly  fraction in atlantic cod identified an abundant h-strand specific long noncoding rna of about 375 nt. the t-p spacer corresponded to the 5’ part of this transcript, which terminated within the control region in a tail-to-tail configuration with the l-strand specific transcript .


CONCLUSIONS
the t-p spacer is inferred to be evolutionary preserved in gadiform mitogenomes due to gain of function through a long noncoding rna. we suggest that the t-p spacer adds stability to the h-strand specific long noncoding rna by forming stable hairpin structures and additional protein binding sites.
