BACKGROUND
monoclonal antibody therapeutics are rapidly gaining in popularity for the treatment of a myriad of diseases, ranging from cancer to autoimmune diseases and neurological diseases. multiple forms of antibody therapeutics are in use today that differ in the amount of human sequence present in both the constant and variable regions, where antibodies that are more human-like usually have reduced immunogenicity in clinical trials.


RESULTS
here we present a method to quantify the humanness of the variable region of monoclonal antibodies and show that this method is able to clearly distinguish human and non-human antibodies with excellent specificity. after creating and analyzing a database of human antibody sequences, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the humanness of therapeutic antibodies, and found that increased humanness score is correlated with decreased immunogenicity of antibodies. we further discovered a surprisingly similarity in the immunogenicity of fully human antibodies and humanized antibodies that are more human-like based on their humanness score.


CONCLUSIONS
our results reveal that in most cases humanizing an antibody and confirming the humanness of the final form may be sufficient to eliminate immunogenicity issues to the same extent as using fully human antibodies. we created a public website to calculate the humanness score of any input antibody sequence based on our human antibody database. this tool will be of great value during the preclinical drug development process for new monoclonal antibody therapeutics.
