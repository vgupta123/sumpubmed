BACKGROUND
fgfrl <dig>  the gene for the fifth member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor  family, is found in all vertebrates from fish to man and in the cephalochordate amphioxus. since it does not occur in more distantly related invertebrates such as insects and nematodes, we have speculated that fgfrl <dig> might have evolved just before branching of the vertebrate lineage from the other invertebrates .


RESULTS
we identified the gene for fgfrl <dig> also in the sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus and cloned its mrna. the deduced amino acid sequence shares 62% sequence similarity with the human protein and shows conservation of all disulfides and n-linked carbohydrate attachment sites. similar to the human protein, the s. purpuratus protein contains a histidine-rich motif at the c-terminus, but this motif is much shorter than the human counterpart. to analyze the function of the novel motif, recombinant fusion proteins were prepared in a bacterial expression system. the human fusion protein bound to nickel and zinc affinity columns, whereas the sea urchin protein barely interacted with such columns. direct determination of metal ions by atomic absorption revealed  <dig>  mole zinc/mole protein for human fgfrl <dig> and  <dig>  mole zinc/mole protein for sea urchin fgfrl <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the fgfrl <dig> gene has evolved much earlier than previously assumed. a comparison of the intracellular domain between sea urchin and human fgfrl <dig> provides interesting insights into the shaping of a novel zinc binding domain.
