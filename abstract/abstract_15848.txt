BACKGROUND
the poultry industry due to intensive methods of farming is burdened with losses from numerous infectious agents, of which one is the fungus aspergillus fumigatus. in a preliminary study, the extracts of loxostylis alata a. spreng, ex rchb. showed good activity in vitro against a. fumigatus with a minimum inhibitory concentration of  <dig>  mg/ml. for this study crude, a crude acetone extract of l. alata leaves was evaluated for its acute toxicity in a healthy chicken model and for efficacy in an infectious model of aspergillosis .


RESULTS
at a dose of  <dig> mg/kg, the extract induced some toxicity characterised by decreased feed intake and weight loss. consequently,  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg were used to ascertain efficacy in the infectious model. the plant extract significantly reduced clinical disease in comparison to the control in a dose dependant manner. the extract was as effective as the positive control ketoconazole dosed at  <dig> mg/kg.


CONCLUSIONS
the results indicate that a crude extract of l. alata leaves has potential as an antifungal agent to protect poultry against avian aspergillosis.
