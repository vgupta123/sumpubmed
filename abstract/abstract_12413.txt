BACKGROUND
the universal ribosomal protein s <dig> is essential for the initiation of small subunit ribosomal assembly and translational accuracy. being part of the information processing machinery of the cell, the gene for s <dig> is generally thought of as being inherited vertically and has been used in concatenated gene phylogenies. here we report the evolution of ribosomal protein s <dig> in relation to a broad sharing of zinc/non-zinc forms of the gene and study the scope of horizontal gene transfer  of s <dig> during bacterial evolution.


RESULTS
in this study we present the complex evolutionary history of ribosomal protein s <dig> using  <dig> bacterial genomes from  <dig> major bacterial phyla. according to conserved characteristics in the sequences, s <dig> can be classified into c+  and c-  variants, with  <dig> genomes  containing genes for both. a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the s <dig> sequences was incongruent with the standard bacterial phylogeny, indicating a departure from strict vertical inheritance. further analysis using the genome content near the s <dig> genes, which are usually located in a conserved gene cluster, showed not only that hgt of the c- gene had occurred at various stages of bacterial evolution, but also that both the c- and c+ genes were present before the individual phyla diverged. to explain the latter, we theorize that a gene pool existed early in bacterial evolution from which bacteria could sample s <dig> gene variants, according to environmental conditions. the distribution of the c+/- variants for seven other zinc-binding ribosomal proteins in these  <dig> bacterial genomes is consistent with that seen for s <dig> and may shed light on the evolutionary pressures involved.


CONCLUSIONS
the complex history presented for "core" protein s <dig> suggests the existence of a gene pool before the emergence of bacterial lineages and reflects the pervasive nature of hgt in subsequent bacterial evolution. this has implications for both theoretical models of evolution and practical applications of phylogenetic reconstruction as well as the control of zinc economy in bacterial cells.
