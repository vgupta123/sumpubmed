BACKGROUND
bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells  are one of the potential tools for treatment of the spinal cord injury; however, the survival and differentiation of mscs in an injured spinal cord still need to be improved. in the present study, we investigated whether governor vessel electro-acupuncture  could efficiently promote bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells  survival and differentiation, axonal regeneration and finally, functional recovery in the transected spinal cord.


RESULTS
the spinal cords of adult sprague-dawley  rats were completely transected at t <dig>  five experimental groups were performed:  <dig>  sham operated control ;  <dig>  operated control ;  <dig>  electro-acupuncture treatment ;  <dig>  mscs transplantation ; and  <dig>  mscs transplantation combined with electro-acupuncture . after 2- <dig> weeks of mscs transplantation plus ea treatment, we found that the neurotrophin- <dig> , camp level, the differentiation of mscs, the 5-ht positive and cgrp positive nerve fibers in the lesion site and nearby tissue of injured spinal cord were significantly increased in the mscs+ea group as compared to the group of the mscs transplantation or the ea treated alone. furthermore, behavioral test and spinal cord evoked potentials detection demonstrated a significantly functional recovery in the mscs +ea group.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that ea treatment may promote grafted mscs survival and differentiation; mscs transplantation combined with ea treatment could promote axonal regeneration and partial locomotor functional recovery in the transected spinal cord in rats and indicate a promising avenue of treatment of spinal cord injury.
