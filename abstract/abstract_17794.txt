BACKGROUND
prenatal maternal lipopolysaccharide  exposure leads to behavioral deficits such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia in the adult lives. lps-exposure resulted in the production of cytokines and oxidative damage. on the contrary, astaxanthin is a carotenoid compound, showed neuroprotective properties via its antioxidant capacity. this study examines the effect of astaxanthin on the prenatal maternal lps-induced postnatal behavioral deficit in mice.


RESULTS
we found that prenatal lps-exposed mice showed extensive immobile phase in the tail suspension test, higher frequent head dipping in the hole-board test and greater hypolocomotion in the open field test. all these values were statistically significant . in addition, a marked elevation of the level of lipid peroxidation, advanced protein oxidation product, nitric oxide, while a pronounced depletion of antioxidant enzymes  were observed in the adult offspring mice that were prenatally exposed to lps. to the contrary, 6-weeks long treatment with astaxanthin significantly improved all behavioral deficits  and diminished prenatal lps-induced oxidative stress markers in the brain and liver.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these results suggest that prenatal maternal lps-exposure leads to behavioral deficits in the adults, while astaxanthin ameliorates the behavioral deficits presumably via its antioxidant property.
