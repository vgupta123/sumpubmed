BACKGROUND
previously a variety of environmental toxicants were found to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease through differential dna methylation regions , termed epimutations, present in sperm. the transgenerational epimutations in sperm and somatic cells identified in a number of previous studies were further investigated.


RESULTS
the epimutations from six different environmental exposures were found to be predominantly exposure specific with negligible overlap. the current report describes a major genomic feature of all the unique epimutations identified  as a very low  cpg density in sperm and somatic cells associated with transgenerational disease. the genomic locations of these epimutations were found to contain dmrs with small clusters of cpg within a general region of very low density cpg. the potential role of these epimutations on gene expression is suggested to be important.


CONCLUSIONS
observations suggest a potential regulatory role for lower density cpg regions termed “cpg deserts”. the potential evolutionary origins of these regions is also discussed.
