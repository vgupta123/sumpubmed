BACKGROUND
in bacteria, such as salmonella typhimurium, tryptophan is synthesized from indole-3-glycerole phosphate  by a tryptophan synthase αββα heterotetramer. plants have evolved multiple α  and β  homologs, which have probably diverged in biological function and their ability of subunit interaction. there is some evidence for a tryptophan synthase  complex in arabidopsis. on the other hand maize  expresses the tsa-homologs bx <dig> and igl that efficiently cleave igp, independent of interaction with tsb.


RESULTS
in order to clarify, how tryptophan is synthesized in maize, two tsa homologs, hitherto uncharacterized zmtsa and zmtsalike, were functionally analyzed. zmtsa is localized in plastids, the major site of tryptophan biosynthesis in plants. it catalyzes the tryptophan synthase α-reaction , and forms a tryptophan synthase complex with zmtsb <dig> in vitro. the catalytic efficiency of the α-reaction is strongly enhanced upon complex formation. a  <dig> kd tryptophan synthase complex was partially purified from maize leaves and zmtsa was identified as native α-subunit of this complex by mass spectrometry. zmtsalike, for which no in vitro activity was detected, is localized in the cytosol. zmtsalike, bx <dig>  and igl were not detectable in the native tryptophan synthase complex in leaves.


CONCLUSIONS
it was demonstrated in vivo and in vitro that maize forms a tryptophan synthase complex and zmtsa functions as α-subunit in this complex.
