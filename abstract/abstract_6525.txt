BACKGROUND
maturation of spermatozoa, including development of motility and the ability to fertilize the oocyte, occurs during transit through the microenvironment of the epididymis. comprehensive understanding of sperm maturation requires identification and characterization of unique genes expressed in the epididymis.


RESULTS
we systematically identified  <dig> novel genes with epididymis-specific or -predominant expression in the mouse epididymis unigene library, containing  <dig> gene-oriented transcript clusters, by in silico and in vitro analyses. the northern blot analysis revealed various characteristics of the genes at the transcript level, such as expression level, size and the presence of isoform. we found that expression of the half of the genes is regulated by androgens. further expression analyses demonstrated that the novel genes are region-specific and developmentally regulated. computational analysis showed that  <dig> of the genes lack human orthologues, suggesting their implication in male reproduction unique to the mouse. a number of the novel genes are putative epididymal protease inhibitors or Î²-defensins. we also found that six of the genes have secretory activity, indicating that they may interact with sperm and have functional roles in sperm maturation.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified and characterized  <dig> novel epididymis-specific or -predominant genes by an integrative approach. our study is unique in the aspect of systematic identification of novel epididymal genes and should be a firm basis for future investigation into molecular mechanisms underlying sperm maturation in the epididymis.
