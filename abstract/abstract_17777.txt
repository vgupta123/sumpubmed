BACKGROUND
the production of citrus, the largest fruit crop of international economic value, has recently been imperiled due to the introduction of the bacterial disease citrus canker. no significant improvements have been made to combat this disease by plant breeding and nuclear transgenic approaches. chloroplast genetic engineering has a number of advantages over nuclear transformation; it not only increases transgene expression but also facilitates transgene containment, which is one of the major impediments for development of transgenic trees. we have sequenced the citrus chloroplast genome to facilitate genetic improvement of this crop and to assess phylogenetic relationships among major lineages of angiosperms.


RESULTS
the complete chloroplast genome sequence of citrus sinensis is  <dig>  bp in length, and contains  <dig> genes . genome organization is very similar to the inferred ancestral angiosperm chloroplast genome. however, in citrus the infa gene is absent. the inverted repeat region has expanded to duplicate rps <dig> and the first  <dig> amino acids of rpl <dig>  the rpl <dig> gene in the irb region has a nonsense mutation resulting in  <dig> stop codons. this was confirmed by pcr amplification and sequencing using primers that flank the ir/lsc boundaries. repeat analysis identified  <dig> direct and inverted repeats  <dig> bp or longer with a sequence identity â‰¥ 90%. comparison of protein-coding sequences with expressed sequence tags revealed six putative rna edits, five of which resulted in non-synonymous modifications in petl, psbh, ycf <dig> and ndha. phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony  and maximum likelihood  methods of a dataset composed of  <dig> protein-coding genes for  <dig> taxa provide strong support for the monophyly of several major clades of angiosperms, including monocots, eudicots, rosids and asterids. the mp and ml trees are incongruent in three areas: the position of amborella and nymphaeales, relationship of the magnoliid genus calycanthus, and the monophyly of the eurosid i clade. both mp and ml trees provide strong support for the monophyly of eurosids ii and for the placement of citrus  sister to a clade including the malvales/brassicales.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first complete chloroplast genome sequence for a member of the rutaceae and sapindales. expansion of the inverted repeat region to include rps <dig> and part of rpl <dig> and presence of two truncated copies of rpl <dig> is unusual among sequenced chloroplast genomes. availability of a complete citrus chloroplast genome sequence provides valuable information on intergenic spacer regions and endogenous regulatory sequences for chloroplast genetic engineering. phylogenetic analyses resolve relationships among several major clades of angiosperms and provide strong support for the monophyly of the eurosid ii clade and the position of the sapindales sister to the brassicales/malvales.
