BACKGROUND
the β-carbonic anhydrase  enzymes have been reported in a variety of organisms, but their existence in animals has been unclear. the purpose of the present study was to perform extensive sequence analysis to show that the β-cas are present in invertebrates and to clone and characterize a member of this enzyme family from a representative model organism of the animal kingdom, e.g., drosophila melanogaster.


RESULTS
the novel β-ca gene, here named dmbca, was identified from flybase, and its orthologs were searched and reconstructed from sequence databases, confirming the presence of β-ca sequences in  <dig> metazoan species. the corresponding recombinant enzyme was produced in sf <dig> insect cells, purified, kinetically characterized, and its inhibition was investigated with a series of simple, inorganic anions. holoenzyme molecular mass was defined by dynamic light scattering analysis and gel filtration, and the results suggested that the holoenzyme is a dimer. double immunostaining confirmed predictions based on sequence analysis and localized dmbca protein to mitochondria. the enzyme showed high co <dig> hydratase activity, with a kcat of  <dig>  ×  <dig> s- <dig> and a kcat/km of  <dig>  ×  <dig> m-1s- <dig>  dmbca was appreciably inhibited by the clinically-used sulfonamide acetazolamide, with an inhibition constant of  <dig> nm. it was moderately inhibited by halides, pseudohalides, hydrogen sulfide, bisulfite and sulfate  and more potently by sulfamide . bicarbonate, nitrate, nitrite and phenylarsonic/boronic acids were much weaker inhibitors .


CONCLUSIONS
the drosophila β-ca represents a highly active mitochondrial enzyme that is a potential model enzyme for anti-parasitic drug development.
