BACKGROUND
periodontitis is a bacterial infection of the periodontal tissues. the gram-negative anaerobic bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis is considered a major causative agent. one of the virulence factors of p. gingivalis is capsular polysaccharide . non-encapsulated strains have been shown to be less virulent in mouse models than encapsulated strains.


RESULTS
to examine the role of the cps in host-pathogen interactions we constructed an insertional isogenic p. gingivalis knockout in the epimerase-coding gene epsc that is located at the end of the cps biosynthesis locus. this mutant was subsequently shown to be non-encapsulated. k <dig> capsule biosynthesis could be restored by in trans expression of an intact epsc gene. we used the epsc mutant, the w <dig> wild type strain and the complemented mutant to challenge human gingival fibroblasts to examine the immune response by quantification of il-1β, il- <dig> and il- <dig> transcription levels. for each of the cytokines significantly higher expression levels were found when fibroblasts were challenged with the epsc mutant compared to those challenged with the w <dig> wild type, ranging from two times higher for il-1β to five times higher for il- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these experiments provide the first evidence that p. gingivalis cps acts as an interface between the pathogen and the host that may reduce the host's pro-inflammatory immune response. the higher virulence of encapsulated strains may be caused by this phenomenon which enables the bacteria to evade the immune system.
