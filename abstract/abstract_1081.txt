BACKGROUND
recent research suggests that alcohol-based skin antiseptics exhibit their efficacy on the resident skin flora of the forehead in less than  <dig> minutes. that is why we have looked at the efficacy of two ethanol-based skin antiseptics applied for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> minutes on skin with a high density of sebaceous glands. each experiment was performed in a reference-controlled cross-over design with at least  <dig> participants. application of isopropanol  for  <dig> minutes to the forehead served as the reference treatment. the clear  and coloured preparations  contain 85% ethanol . pre-values and post-values  were obtained by swabbing a marked area of  <dig> cm <dig> for about  <dig> s. swabs were vortexed in tryptic soy broth containing valid neutralizing agents. after serial dilution aliquots were spread on tryptic soy agar. colonies were counted after incubation of plates at 36Â°c for  <dig> h. the mean log <dig> reduction of bacteria was calculated. the wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test was used for a comparison of treatments.


RESULTS
skin antiseptic a applied for  <dig> min was significantly more effective than the reference treatment. when applied for  <dig>  min  it was significantly more effective than the reference treatment immediately after application  and equally effective after  <dig> min . skin antiseptic b applied for  <dig>  min  was significantly more effective than the reference treatment both immediately after application  and after  <dig> min .


CONCLUSIONS
the clear and coloured skin antiseptics applied for  <dig>  min on the skin of the forehead fulfilled the efficacy requirements for skin antisepsis. the shorter application time on skin with a high density of sebaceous glands will allow to act more efficiently in clinical practice.
