BACKGROUND
nitric oxide , an important signaling molecule with biological functions, has antimicrobial activity against a variety of pathogens including viruses. to our knowledge, little information is available about the regulatory effect of no on porcine circovirus type  <dig>  infection. this study was conducted to investigate the antiviral activity of no generated from s-nitrosoglutathione , during pcv <dig> infection of pk- <dig> cells and balb/c mice.


RESULTS
gsno released considerable no in the culture medium of pk- <dig> cells, and no was scavenged by its scavenger hemoglobin  in a dose-dependent manner. no strongly inhibited pcv <dig> replication in pk- <dig> cells, and the antiviral effect was reversed by hb. an in vivo assay indicated that gsno treatment reduced the progression of pcv <dig> infection in mice, evident as reductions in the percentages of pcv2-positive sera and tissue samples and in the viral dna copies in serum samples. gsno also improved the growth performance and immune organs  of the pcv2-infected mice to some degree.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate that the no-generating compound gsno suppresses pcv <dig> infection in pk- <dig> cells and balb/c mice, indicating that no and its donor, gsno, have potential value as antiviral drugs against pcv <dig> infection.
