BACKGROUND
development of a practical gene point-of-care testing device  requires innovative detection methods for demonstrating the results of the gene amplification reaction without the use of expensive equipment. we have studied a new method for the sequence-specific visual detection of minute amounts of nucleic acids using precipitation reaction by addition of cationic polymers to amplicons of loop mediated isothermal amplification .


RESULTS
oligo dna probes labeled with different fluorescent dyes were prepared for multiple nucleic acid templates, and the templates were amplified by the lamp reactions under the existence of the probes. at completion of the lamp reaction, an optimal amount of low molecular weight polyethylenimine  was added, resulting in the precipitation of the insoluble lamp amplicon-pei complex. the fluorescently labeled oligo dna probes hybridized to the lamp product were incorporated into the precipitation, and the precipitate emitted fluorescence corresponding to the amplified nucleic acid templates. the color of emitted fluorescence can be detected easily by naked eye on a conventional uv illuminator.


CONCLUSIONS
the presence or absence of minute amount of nucleic acid templates could be detected in a simple manner through visual assessment for the color of the lamp amplicon-pei complex precipitate. we conclude that this detection method may facilitate development of small and simple g-poct device.
