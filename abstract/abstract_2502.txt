BACKGROUND
toxoplasma gondii belongs to a large and diverse group of obligate intracellular parasitic protozoa. primary culture of mice skeletal muscle cells  was employed as a model for experimental toxoplasmosis studies. the myogenesis of skmc was reproduced in vitro and the ability of t. gondii tachyzoite forms to infect myoblasts and myotubes and its influence on skmc myogenesis were analyzed.


RESULTS
in this study we show that, after  <dig> h of interaction, myoblasts  were more infected with t. gondii than myotubes  and inhibition of myogenesis was about 75%. the role of adhesion molecules such as cadherin in this event was investigated. first, we demonstrate that cadherin localization was restricted to the contact areas between myocytes/myocytes and myocytes/myotubes during the myogenesis process. immunofluorescence and immunoblotting analysis of parasite-host cell interaction showed a 54% reduction in cadherin expression at  <dig> h of infection. concomitantly, a reduction in m-cadherin mrna levels was observed after  <dig> and  <dig> h of t. gondii-host cell interaction.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that t. gondii is able to down regulate m-cadherin expression, leading to molecular modifications in the host cell surface that interfere with membrane fusion and consequently affect the myogenesis process.
