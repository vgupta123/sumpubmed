BACKGROUND
the aim of the study was to investigate expression of adams  of host cell origin during cell-cell fusion induced by human parainfluenza virus type  <dig> .


RESULTS
induction of host cell adam <dig> was observed in gmk cells, but the applicability of this model was restricted by lack of cross-reactivity of the anti-human adam <dig> antibodies with the corresponding green monkey antigens. hsg cells were not susceptible to hpiv <dig> virus infection. in contrast, in human parotid gland hsy cells, a natural host cell for paramyxoviruses, hpiv <dig> induced adam <dig> expression. adam <dig> staining increased dramatically over time from  <dig>  ± 3% at zero hours to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> hours . without hpiv <dig> the corresponding percentages were only  <dig> % and  <dig> %. moreover, adam <dig> positive cells formed bi-  and multinuclear cells  on day one and the corresponding percentages on day three were  <dig> % for binuclear and  <dig> % for multinuclear cells.


CONCLUSIONS
adam <dig>  well recognized for participation in cell-to-cell fusion especially in osteoclast formation, is up-regulated upon formation of multinuclear giant cells after hpiv <dig> induction in hsy cells. the virus-hsy cell system provides a novel experimental model for study of the molecular mechanism of cell fusion events.
