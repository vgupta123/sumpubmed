BACKGROUND
understanding the community structure of microbes is typically accomplished by sequencing 16s ribosomal rna  genes. these community data can be represented by constructing a phylogenetic tree and comparing it with other samples using statistical methods. however, owing to high computational complexity, these methods are insufficient to effectively analyze the millions of sequences produced by new sequencing technologies such as pyrosequencing.


RESULTS
we introduce a web tool named vitcomic  that can analyze millions of bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences and calculate the overall taxonomic composition for a microbial community. the 16s rrna gene sequences of genome-sequenced strains are used as references to identify the nearest relative of each sample sequence. with this information, vitcomic plots all sequences in a single figure and indicates relative evolutionary distances.


CONCLUSIONS
vitcomic yields a clear representation of the overall taxonomic composition of each sample and facilitates an intuitive understanding of differences in community structure between samples. vitcomic is freely available at http://mg.bio.titech.ac.jp/vitcomic/.
