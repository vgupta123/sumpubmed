BACKGROUND
selective pressure in molecular evolution leads to uneven distributions of amino acids and nucleotides. in fact one observes correlations among such constituents due to a large number of biophysical mechanisms . to quantify these correlations the mutual information -after proper normalization - has proven most effective. the challenge is to navigate the large amount of data, which in a study for a typical protein cannot simply be plotted.


RESULTS
to visually analyze mutual information we developed a matrix visualization tool that allows different views on the mutual information matrix: filtering, sorting, and weighting are among them. the user can interactively navigate a huge matrix in real-time and search e.g., for patterns and unusual high or low values. a computation of the mutual information matrix for a sequence alignment in fasta-format is possible. the respective stand-alone program computes in addition proper normalizations for a null model of neutral evolution and maps the mutual information to z-scores with respect to the null model.


CONCLUSIONS
the new tool allows to compute and visually analyze sequence data for possible co-evolutionary signals. the tool has already been successfully employed in evolutionary studies on hiv <dig> protease and acetylcholinesterase. the functionality of the tool was defined by users using the tool in real-world research. the software can also be used for visual analysis of other matrix-like data, such as information obtained by dna microarray experiments. the package is platform-independently implemented in java and free for academic use under a gpl license.
