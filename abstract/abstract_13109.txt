BACKGROUND
apolipoprotein b  is an integral part of the ldl, vldl, idl, lp and chylomicron lipoprotein particles. the apob pre-mrna consists of  <dig> constitutively-spliced exons. apob exists as two natural isoforms: the full-length apob <dig> isoform, assembled into ldl, vldl, idl and lp and secreted by the liver in humans; and the c-terminally truncated apob <dig>  assembled into chylomicrons and secreted by the intestine in humans. down-regulation of apob <dig> is a potential therapy to lower circulating ldl and cholesterol levels.


RESULTS
we investigated the ability of 2'o-methyl rna antisense oligonucleotides  to induce the skipping of exon  <dig> in endogenous apob mrna in hepg <dig> cells. these asos are directed towards the 5' and 3' splice-sites of exon  <dig>  the branch-point sequence  of intron 26â€“ <dig> and several predicted exonic splicing enhancers within exon  <dig>  asos targeting either the 5' or 3' splice-site, in combination with the bps, are the most effective. the splicing of other alternatively spliced genes are not influenced by these asos, suggesting that the effects seen are not due to non-specific changes in alternative splicing. the skip  <dig> mrna is translated into a truncated isoform, apob87skip <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the induction of apob87skip <dig> expression in vivo should lead to decreased ldl and cholesterol levels, by analogy to patients with hypobetalipoproteinemia. as intestinal apob mrna editing and apob <dig> expression rely on sequences within exon  <dig>  exon  <dig> skipping should not affect apob <dig> expression unlike other methods of down-regulating apob <dig> expression which also down-regulate apob <dig>
