BACKGROUND
we recently observed an association of resistance with a certain enteropathogenic escherichia coli  serotypes and identified a conjugative plasmid, similar to plasmid ped <dig>  that was conserved among archival o111:h2/nm and o119:h <dig> strains of diverse geographical origin. in this study, we sought to determine the prevalence and distribution of this plasmid among a collection of epec isolates from brazil, as well as to study the susceptibilities of these isolates to antimicrobial agents.


RESULTS
resistance was more commonly seen in typical epec than atypical strains. the most prevalent resistances were to ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin and the sulfonamides. markers for the epec conjugative multiresistance plasmid, were detected in  <dig>  of typical but only  <dig>  of atypical strains . this plasmid, previously reported from only o <dig> and o <dig> strains was found in o <dig> and o <dig> strains and was associated with the presence of class  <dig> integrons.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest a limited but expanding host range for the epec resistance plasmid.
