BACKGROUND
gene expression profiles have been frequently integrated with the human protein interactome to uncover functional modules under specific conditions like disease state. beyond traditional differential expression analysis, differential co-expression analysis has emerged as a robust approach to reveal condition-specific network modules, with successful applications in a few human disease studies. hepatocellular carcinoma , which is often interrelated with the hepatitis c virus, typically develops through multiple stages. a comprehensive investigation of hcc progression-specific differential co-expression modules may advance our understanding of hcc's pathophysiological mechanisms.


RESULTS
compared with differentially expressed genes, differentially co-expressed genes were found more likely enriched with hepatitis c virus binding proteins and cancer-mutated genes, and they were clustered more densely in the human reference protein interaction network. these observations indicated that a differential co-expression approach could outperform the standard differential expression network analysis in searching for disease-related modules. we then proposed a differential co-expression network approach to uncover network modules involved in hcc development. specifically, we discovered subnetworks that enriched differentially co-expressed gene pairs in each hcc transition stage, and further resolved modules with coherent co-expression change patterns over all hcc developmental stages. our identified network modules were enriched with hcc-related genes and implicated in cancer-related biological functions. in particular, apc and ywhaz were highlighted as two most remarkable genes in the network modules, and their dynamic interaction partnership was resolved in hcc development.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that integration of differential co-expression with the protein interactome could outperform the traditional differential expression approach in discovering network modules of human diseases. in our application of this approach to hcc's gene expression data, we successfully identified subnetworks with marked differential co-expression in individual hcc stage transitions and network modules with coherent co-expression change patterns over all hcc developmental stages. our results shed light on subtle hcc mechanisms, including temporal activation and dismissal of pivotal functions and dynamic interaction partnerships of key genes.
