BACKGROUND
micrornas  are 20– <dig> nucleotide rna molecules that suppress the transcription of target genes and may also inhibit translation. despite the thousands of mirnas identified and validated in numerous plant species, only small numbers have been identified from the oilseed crop plant brassica napus  – especially in seeds.


RESULTS
using next-generation sequencing technologies, we performed a comprehensive analysis of mirnas during seed maturation at  <dig> time points from 10 days after flowering  to  <dig> daf using whole seeds and included separate analyses of radicle, hypocotyl, cotyledon, embryo, endosperm and seed coat tissues at  <dig> selected time points. we identified more than  <dig> conserved mirna or variant unique sequences with > <dig> sequence reads and also found  <dig> novel mirnas. only  <dig> of the conserved mirna sequences had been previously identified in b. napus . more than  <dig> mirna loci were identified/annotated using the b. rapa genome as a surrogate for the b.napus a genome. numerous mirnas were expressed in a stage- or tissue-specific manner suggesting that they have specific functions related to the fine tuning of transcript abundance during seed development. mirna targets in b. napus were predicted and their expression patterns profiled using microarray analyses. global correlation analysis of the expression patterns of mirnas and their targets revealed complex mirna-target gene regulatory networks during seed development. the mir <dig> family was the most abundant and the majority of the family members were primarily expressed in the embryo.


CONCLUSIONS
large numbers of mirnas with diverse expression patterns, multiple-targeting and co-targeting of many mirnas, and complex relationships between expression of mirnas and targets were identified in this study. several key mirna-target expression patterns were identified and new roles of mirnas in regulating seed development are suggested. mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> are the major contributors to the network controlling seed development and maturation through their pivotal roles in plant development. mir <dig> may regulate the developmental transition to germination.
