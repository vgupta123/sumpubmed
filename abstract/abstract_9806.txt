BACKGROUND
heterologous prime-boost immunization protocols using different gene expression systems have proven to be successful tools in protecting against various diseases in experimental animal models. the main reason for using this approach is to exploit the ability of expression cassettes to prime or boost the immune system in different ways during vaccination procedures. the purpose of the project was to study the ability of recombinant vaccinia virus  and bacterial plasmid, both carrying the ns <dig> gene from tick-borne encephalitis  virus under the control of different promoters, to protect mice against lethal challenge using a heterologous prime-boost vaccination protocol.


RESULTS
the heterologous prime-boost vaccination protocol, using a vv recombinant and bacterial plasmid, both containing the ns <dig> tbe virus protein gene under the control of different promoters, achieved a high level of protection in mice against lethal challenge with a highly pathogenic tbe virus strain. no signs of pronounced tbe infection were detected in the surviving animals.


CONCLUSIONS
heterologous prime-boost vaccination protocols using recombinant vv and bacterial plasmids could be used for the development of flavivirus vaccines.
