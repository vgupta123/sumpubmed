BACKGROUND
statistical approaches to describing the behaviour, including the complex relationships between input parameters and model outputs, of nonlinear dynamic models  are gaining more and more acceptance as a means for sensitivity analysis and to reduce computational demand. understanding such input-output maps is necessary for efficient model construction and validation. multi-way metamodelling provides the opportunity to retain the block-wise structure of the temporal data typically generated by dynamic models throughout the analysis. furthermore, a cluster-based approach to regional metamodelling allows description of highly nonlinear input-output relationships, revealing additional patterns of covariation.


RESULTS
by presenting the n-way hierarchical cluster-based partial least squares regression  method, we here combine multi-way analysis with regional cluster-based metamodelling, together making a powerful methodology for extensive exploration of the input-output maps of complex dynamic models. we illustrate the potential of the n-way hc-plsr by applying it both to predict model outputs as functions of the input parameters, and in the inverse direction , to analyse the behaviour of a dynamic model of the mammalian circadian clock. our results display a more complete cartography of how variation in input parameters is reflected in the temporal behaviour of multiple model outputs than has been previously reported.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicated that the n-way hc-plsr metamodelling provides a gain in insight into which parameters that are related to a specific model output behaviour, as well as variations in the model sensitivity to certain input parameters across the model output space. moreover, the n-way approach allows a more transparent and detailed exploration of the temporal dimension of complex dynamic models, compared to alternative 2-way methods.
