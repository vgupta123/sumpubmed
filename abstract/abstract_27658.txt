BACKGROUND
type i and type ii interferons  exert their effects mainly through the jak/stat pathway, which is presently best described in mammals. stat <dig> is involved in signaling pathways induced by both types of ifns. it has a domain-like structure including an amino-terminus that stabilizes interaction between stat dimers in a promoter-binding situation, a coiled coil domain facilitating interactions to other proteins, a central dna-binding domain, a sh <dig> domain responsible for dimerization of phosphorylated stats and conserved phosphorylation sites within the carboxy terminus. the latter is also the transcriptional activation domain.


RESULTS
a salmon  stat <dig> homologue, named ssstat1a, has been identified and was shown to be ubiquitously expressed in various cells and tissues. the ssstat1a had a domain-like structure with functional motifs that are similar to higher vertebrates. endogenous stat <dig> was shown to be phosphorylated at tyrosine residues both in salmon leukocytes and in to cells treated with recombinant type i and type ii ifns. also ectopically expressed ssstat <dig> was phosphorylated in salmon cells upon in vitro stimulation by the ifns, confirming that the cloned gene was recognized by upstream tyrosine kinases. treatment with ifns led to nuclear translocation of stat <dig> within one hour. the ability of salmon stat <dig> to dimerize was also shown.


CONCLUSIONS
the structural and functional properties of salmon stat <dig> resemble the properties of mammalian stat <dig>
