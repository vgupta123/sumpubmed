BACKGROUND
γ-aminobutyric acid type a  receptors provide the main inhibitory control in the brain. their heterogeneity may make it possible to precisely target drug effects to selected neuronal populations. in situ hybridization using rat brain sections has revealed a unique expression of gabaa receptor ε and θ subunit transcripts in the locus coeruleus, where they are accompanied at least by α <dig>  α <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> subunits. here, we studied the pharmacology of the human α3β <dig>  α3β1ε, α3β1θ and α3β1εθ receptor subtypes expressed in xenopus oocytes and compared them with the γ <dig> subunit-containing receptors.


RESULTS
the gaba sensitivites and effects of several positive modulators of gabaa receptors were studied in the absence and the presence of ec <dig> gaba using the two-electrode voltage-clamp method. we found 100-fold differences in gaba sensitivity between the receptors, α3β1ε subtype being the most sensitive and α3β1γ <dig> the least sensitive. also gaboxadol dose-response curves followed the same sensitivity rank order, with ec <dig> values being  <dig> and  <dig> μm for α3β1ε and α3β1γ <dig> subtypes, respectively. in the presence of ec <dig> gaba, introduction of the ε subunit to the receptor complex resulted in diminished modulatory effects by etomidate, propofol, pregnanolone and flurazepam, but not by pentobarbital. furthermore, the α3β1ε subtype displayed picrotoxin-sensitive spontaneous activity. the θ subunit-containing receptors were efficiently potentiated by the anesthetic etomidate, suggesting that θ subunit could bring the properties of β <dig> or β <dig> subunits to the receptor complex.


CONCLUSIONS
the ε and θ subunits bring additional features to α3β <dig> gabaa receptors. these receptor subtypes may constitute as novel drug targets in selected brain regions, e.g., in the brainstem locus coeruleus nuclei.
