BACKGROUND
the detection and quantification of uric acid in human physiological fluids is of great importance in the diagnosis and therapy of patients suffering from a range of disorders associated with altered purine metabolism, most notably gout and hyperuricaemia. the fabrication of cheap and reliable urate-selective amperometric biosensors is a challenging task.


RESULTS
a urate-selective microbial biosensor was developed using cells of the recombinant thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast hansenula polymorpha as biorecognition element. the construction of uricase  producing yeast by over-expression of the uricase gene of h. polymorpha is described. following a preliminary screening of the transformants with increased uox activity in permeabilized yeast cells the optimal cultivation conditions for maximal uox yield namely a 40-fold increase in uox activity were determined.

the uox producing cells were coupled to horseradish peroxidase and immobilized on graphite electrodes by physical entrapment behind a dialysis membrane. a high urate selectivity with a detection limit of about  <dig> Î¼m was found.


CONCLUSIONS
a strain of h. polymorpha overproducing uox was constructed. a cheap urate selective microbial biosensor was developed.
