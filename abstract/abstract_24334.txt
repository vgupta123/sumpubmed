BACKGROUND
the objective of the study was to evaluate the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines  in endometrial tissue and circulating leukocytes in response to uterine inoculation of  <dig> colony forming units  escherichia coli in mares. before inoculation, mares were classified as resistant or susceptible to persistent endometritis based on their uterine inflammatory response to infusion of  <dig> killed spermatozoa and histological assessment of the endometrial quality. endometrial biopsies were obtained  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours  after bacterial inoculation and blood samples were obtained during the  <dig> day period post bacterial inoculation. expression levels of cytokines and saa were determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase pcr .


RESULTS
compared to levels in a control biopsy , resistant mares showed an up-regulation of il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tnf-α at  <dig> h after e. coli inoculation, while susceptible mares showed increased gene expression of il- <dig> and il-1ra. susceptible mares had a significant lower gene expression of tnf-α,il- <dig> and increased expression of il-1ra  <dig> h after e. coli inoculation compared to resistant mares. susceptible mares showed a sustained and prolonged inflammatory response with increased gene expression levels of il-1β, il- <dig>  il-1ra and il-1β:il-1ra ratio throughout the entire study period , whereas levels in resistant mares returned to estrous control levels by  <dig> hours. endometrial mrna transcripts of il-1β and il-1ra were significantly higher in mares with heavy uterine bacterial growth compared to mares with no/mild growth.

all blood parameters were unaffected by intrauterine e. coli infusion, except for a lower gene expression of il- <dig> at  <dig> h and an increased expression of il-1ra at  <dig> h observed in susceptible mares compared to resistant mares.


CONCLUSIONS
the current investigation suggests that endometrial mrna transcripts of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to endometritis are finely regulated in resistant mares, with initial high expression levels followed by normalization within a short period of time. susceptible mares had a prolonged expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, supporting the hypothesis that an unbalanced endometrial gene expression of inflammatory cytokines might play an important role in the pathogenesis of persistent endometritis.
