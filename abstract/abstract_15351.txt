BACKGROUND
pairing of homologous chromosomes at meiosis is an important requirement for recombination and balanced chromosome segregation among the products of meiotic division. recombination is initiated by double strand breaks  made by spo <dig> followed by interaction of dsb sites with a homologous chromosome. this interaction requires the strand exchange proteins rad <dig> and dmc <dig> that bind to single stranded regions created by resection of ends at the site of dsbs and promote interactions with uncut dna on the homologous partner. recombination is also considered to be dependent on factors that stabilize interactions between homologous chromosomes. in budding yeast hop <dig> and mnd <dig> act as a complex to promote homologous pairing and recombination in conjunction with rad <dig> and dmc <dig> 


RESULTS
we have analyzed the function of the arabidopsis orthologue of the budding yeast mnd <dig> gene . loss of atmnd <dig> did not affect normal vegetative development but caused fragmentation and missegregation of chromosomes in male and female meiosis, formation of inviable gametes, and sterility. analysis of the atmnd <dig> atspo11- <dig> double mutant indicated that chromosome fragmentation in atmnd <dig> was suppressed by loss of atspo11- <dig>  fluorescence in situ hybridization  analysis showed that homologous pairing failed to occur and homologues remained apart throughout meiosis. atmnd <dig> showed strong expression in meiocytes as revealed by rna in situs.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that atmnd <dig> is required for homologous pairing and is likely to play a role in the repair of dna double strand breaks during meiosis in arabidopsis, thus showing conservation of function with that of mnd <dig> during meiosis in yeast.
