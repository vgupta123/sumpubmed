BACKGROUND
grapevine berry, a nonclimacteric fruit, has three developmental stages; the last one is when berry color and sugar increase. flavors derived from terpenoid and fatty acid metabolism develop at the very end of this ripening stage. the transcriptomic response of pulp and skin of cabernet sauvignon berries in the late stages of ripening between  <dig> and  <dig> °brix was assessed using whole-genome micorarrays.


RESULTS
the transcript abundance of approximately  <dig>  genes changed with °brix and tissue type. there were a large number of changes in many gene ontology  categories involving metabolism, signaling and abiotic stress. go categories reflecting tissue differences were overrepresented in photosynthesis, isoprenoid metabolism and pigment biosynthesis. detailed analysis of the interaction of the skin and pulp with °brix revealed that there were statistically significantly higher abundances of transcripts changing with °brix in the skin that were involved in ethylene signaling, isoprenoid and fatty acid metabolism. many transcripts were peaking around known optimal fruit stages for flavor production. the transcript abundance of approximately two-thirds of the ap2/erf superfamily of transcription factors changed during these developmental stages. the transcript abundance of a unique clade of erf6-type transcription factors had the largest changes in the skin and clustered with genes involved in ethylene, senescence, and fruit flavor production including acc oxidase, terpene synthases, and lipoxygenases. the transcript abundance of important transcription factors involved in fruit ripening was also higher in the skin.


CONCLUSIONS
a detailed analysis of the transcriptome dynamics during late stages of ripening of grapevine berries revealed that these berries went through massive transcriptional changes in gene ontology categories involving chemical signaling and metabolism in both the pulp and skin, particularly in the skin. changes in the transcript abundance of genes involved in the ethylene signaling pathway of this nonclimacteric fruit were statistically significant in the late stages of ripening when the production of transcripts for important flavor and aroma compounds were at their highest. ethylene transcription factors known to play a role in leaf senescence also appear to play a role in fruit senescence. ethylene may play a bigger role than previously thought in this non-climacteric fruit.
