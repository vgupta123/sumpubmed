BACKGROUND
copy number variations  can create new genes, change gene dosage, reshape gene structures, and modify elements regulating gene expression. as with all types of genetic variation, cnvs may influence phenotypic variation and gene expression. cnvs are thus considered major sources of genetic variation. little is known, however, about their contribution to genetic variation in rice.


RESULTS
to detect cnvs, we used a set of nimblegen whole-genome comparative genomic hybridization arrays containing  <dig>  oligonucleotide probes with a median probe spacing of  <dig> bp. we compiled a high-resolution map of cnvs in the rice genome, showing  <dig> cnvs between the genomes of the rice cultivars 'nipponbare'  and 'guang-lu-ai 4' . the cnvs identified vary in size from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb, and encompass approximately  <dig>  mb of the rice genome. the largest regions showing copy gain and loss are of  <dig>  kb on chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb on chromosome  <dig>  in addition,  <dig> dna segments were identified, including some genic sequences. contracted genes greatly outnumbered duplicated ones. many of the contracted genes corresponded to either the same genes or genes involved in the same biological processes; this was also the case for genes involved in disease and defense.


CONCLUSIONS
we detected cnvs in rice by array-based comparative genomic hybridization. these cnvs contain known genes. further discussion of cnvs is important, as they are linked to variation among rice varieties, and are likely to contribute to subspecific characteristics.
