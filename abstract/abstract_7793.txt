BACKGROUND
eco1/ctf <dig> is essential for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion during s phase of the cell cycle. inactivation of ctf7/eco <dig> leads to a lethal phenotype in most organisms. altering eco1/ctf <dig> levels or point mutations in the gene can lead to alterations in nuclear division as well as a wide range of developmental defects. inactivation of arabidopsis ctf <dig>  results in severe defects in reproduction and vegetative growth.


RESULTS
to further investigate the function of atctf <dig>  a tagged version of atctf <dig> and several atctf <dig> deletion constructs were created and transformed into wild type or ctf7+/–plants. transgenic plants expressing 35s:ntap:atctf7∆299– <dig>  displayed a wide range of phenotypic alterations in reproduction and vegetative growth. male meiocytes exhibited chromosome fragmentation and uneven chromosome segregation. mutant ovules contained abnormal megasporocyte-like cells during pre-meiosis, megaspores experienced elongated meiosis and megagametogenesis, and defective megaspores/embryo sacs were produced at various stages. the transgenic plants also exhibited a broad range of vegetative defects, including meristem disruption and dwarfism that were inherited in a non-mendelian fashion. transcripts for epigenetically regulated transposable elements  were elevated in transgenic plants. transgenic plants expressing 35s:atctf7∆b displayed similar vegetative defects, suggesting the defects in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants are caused by high-level expression of atctf7∆b.


CONCLUSIONS
high level expression of atctf7∆b disrupts megasporogenesis, megagametogenesis and male meiosis, as well as causing a broad range of vegetative defects, including dwarfism that are inherited in a non-mendelian fashion.
