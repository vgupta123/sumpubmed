BACKGROUND
germ cells must progress through elaborate developmental stages from an undifferentiated germ cell to a fully differentiated gamete. some of these stages include exiting mitosis and entering meiosis, progressing through the various stages of meiotic prophase, adopting either a male  or female  fate, and completing meiosis. additionally, many of the factors needed to drive embryogenesis are synthesized in the germ line. to increase our understanding of the genes that might be necessary for the formation and function of the germ line, we have constructed a sage library from hand dissected c. elegans hermaphrodite gonads.


RESULTS
we found that  <dig> genes, roughly 21% of all known c. elegans genes, are expressed in the adult hermaphrodite germ line. ribosomal genes are highly expressed in the germ line; roughly four fold above their expression levels in the soma. we further found that  <dig> of the germline-expressed genes have enriched expression in the germ line as compared to the soma. a comparison of these  <dig> germline-enriched genes with a similar list of genes prepared using microarrays revealed an overlap of  <dig> genes, mutually reinforcing the two lists. additionally, we identified  <dig> germline-enriched genes, supported by in situ expression data, which were not previously identified. we also found > <dig> fold enrichment for rna binding proteins in the germ line as compared to the soma.


CONCLUSIONS
using multiple technological platforms provides a more complete picture of global gene expression patterns. genes involved in rna metabolism are expressed at a significantly higher level in the germ line than the soma, suggesting a stronger reliance on rna metabolism for control of the expression of genes in the germ line. additionally, the number and expression level of germ line expressed genes on the x chromosome is lower than expected based on a random distribution.
