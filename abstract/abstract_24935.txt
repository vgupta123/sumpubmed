BACKGROUND
transposition event detection of transposable element  in the genome using short reads from the next-generation sequence  was difficult, because the nucleotide sequence of te itself is repetitive, making it difficult to identify locations of its insertions by alignment programs for ngs. we have developed a program with a new algorithm to detect the transpositions from ngs data.


RESULTS
in the process of tool development, we used next-generation sequence  data of derivative lines  of japonica rice cv. nipponbare, regenerated through cell culture. the new program, called a transposon insertion finder , was applied to detect the de novo transpositions of tos <dig> in the regenerated lines. tif searched  <dig> million reads of a line within 20Â min, identifying  <dig> and  <dig> de novo transposition in ttm <dig> and ttm <dig> lines, respectively. all of the transpositions were confirmed by pcr/electrophoresis and sequencing. using the program, we also detected new transposon insertions of p-element from ngs data of drosophila melanogaster.


CONCLUSIONS
tif operates to find the transposition of any elements provided that target site duplications  are generated by their transpositions.
