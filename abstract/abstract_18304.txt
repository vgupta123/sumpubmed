BACKGROUND
sequencing data from the cancer genome atlas , the international cancer genome consortium and other research institutes have revealed the presence of genetic alterations in several tumor types, including gastric cancer. these data have been combined into a catalog of significantly mutated genes for each cancer type. however, it is unclear to what extent significantly mutated genes need to be examined for detecting genetic alterations in gastric cancer patients. here, we constructed two custom-made sequencing panels of different scales, the selective ﻿hotspot﻿ panel and the comprehensive panel, to analyze genetic alterations in  <dig> resected specimens endoscopically obtained from  <dig> gastric cancer patients, and we assessed how many mutations were detectable using these different panels.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> somatic mutations were identified by the selective hotspot panel and  <dig> mutations were detected by the comprehensive panel. all mutations identified by the selective hotspot panel were detected by the comprehensive panel, with high concordant values of the variant allelic fraction of each mutation . at least one mutation was identified in  <dig> patients  by the selective hotspot panel, whereas the comprehensive panel detected mutations in  <dig>  patients. library preparation and sequencing costs were comparable between the two panels.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate the utility of comprehensive panel-based targeted sequencing in gastric cancer.
