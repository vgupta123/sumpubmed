BACKGROUND
polycomb group  proteins are chromatin modifiers involved in early embryonic development as well as in proliferation of adult stem cells and cancer cells. pcg proteins form large repressive complexes termed polycomb repressive complexes  of which prc <dig> and prc <dig> are well studied. differentiation of human embryonic stem  cells into insulin producing cells has been achieved to limited extent, but several aspects of differentiation remain unexplored. the pcg protein dynamics in human embryonic stem  cells during differentiation into pancreatic lineage has not yet been reported. in the present study, the expression of ring1a, ring1b, bmi <dig>  cbx <dig>  suz <dig>  ezh <dig>  eed and jarid <dig> during differentiation of hes cells towards pancreatic lineage was examined.


RESULTS
in-house derived hes cell line kind <dig> was used to study expression of pcg protein upon spontaneous and directed differentiation towards pancreatic lineage. qrt-pcr analysis showed expression of gene transcripts for various lineages in spontaneously differentiated kind <dig> cells, but no differentiation into pancreatic lineage was observed. directed differentiation induced kind <dig> cells grown under feeder-free conditions to transition from definitive endoderm , primitive gut tube stage  and pancreatic progenitors  as evident from expression of sox <dig>  pdx <dig> and sox <dig> by qrt-pcr and western blotting. in spontaneously differentiating kind <dig> cells, ring1a and suz <dig> were upregulated at day  <dig>  while other pcg transcripts were downregulated. qrt-pcr analysis showed transcripts of ring1b, bmi <dig>  suz <dig>  ezh <dig> and eed were upregulated, while ring1a and cbx <dig> expression remained low and jarid <dig> was downregulated during directed differentiation of kind <dig> cells. upregulation of bmi <dig>  ezh <dig> and suz <dig> during differentiation into pancreatic lineage was also confirmed by western blotting. histone modifications such as h3k <dig> trimethylation and monoubiquitinylation of h2ak <dig> increased during differentiation into pancreatic lineage as seen by western blotting.


CONCLUSIONS
our study shows expression of pcg proteins was distinct during spontaneous and directed differentiation. differentiation into pancreatic lineage was achieved by directed differentiation approach and was associated with increased expression of pcg proteins ring1b, bmi <dig>  ezh <dig> and suz <dig> accompanied by increase in monoubiquitinylation of h2ak <dig> and trimethylation of h3k <dig>
