BACKGROUND
concerted evolution occurs in multigene families and is characterized by stretches of homogeneity and higher sequence similarity between paralogues than between orthologues. here we identify human gene pairs that have undergone concerted evolution, caused by ongoing gene conversion, since at least the human-mouse divergence. our strategy involved the identification of duplicated genes with greater similarity within a species than between species. these genes were required to be present in multiple mammalian genomes, suggesting duplication early in mammalian divergence. to eliminate genes that have been conserved due to strong purifying selection, our analysis also required at least one intron to have retained high sequence similarity between paralogues.


RESULTS
we identified three human gene pairs undergoing concerted evolution . phylogenetic investigations reveal that in each case the duplication appears to have occurred prior to eutherian mammalian radiation, with exactly two paralogues present in all examined species. this indicates that all three gene duplication events were established over  <dig> million years ago.


CONCLUSIONS
the extended duration of concerted evolution in multiple distant lineages suggests that there has been prolonged homogenization of specific segments within these gene pairs. although we speculate that selection for homogenization could have been utilized in order to maintain crucial homo- or hetero- binding domains, it remains unclear why gene conversion has persisted for such extended periods of time. through these analyses, our results demonstrate additional examples of a process that plays a definite, although unspecified, role in molecular evolution.
