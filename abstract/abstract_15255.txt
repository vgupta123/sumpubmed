BACKGROUND
grass carp  is one of the most economically important freshwater fish, but its production is often affected by diseases that cause serious economic losses. to date, no good breeding varieties have been obtained using the oriented cultivation technique. the ability to identify disease resistance genes in grass carp is important to cultivate disease-resistant varieties of grass carp.


RESULTS
in this study, we constructed a non-normalized cdna library of head kidney in grass carp, and, after clustering and assembly, we obtained  <dig>  high-quality unigenes. solexa sequencing was used to generate sequence tags from the transcriptomes of the head kidney in grass carp before and after grass carp reovirus  infection. after processing, we obtained  <dig>  tags that were differentially expressed by more than 2-fold between the uninfected and infected groups.  <dig> of the differentially expressed tags  mapped to  <dig> of the unigenes . the up-regulated and down-regulated unigenes were annotated using gene ontology terms;  <dig> were annotated as immune-related and  <dig> were of unknown function having no matches to any of the sequences in the databases that were used in the similarity searches. semi-quantitative rt-pcr revealed four unknown unigenes that showed significant responses to the viral infection. based on domain structure predictions, one of these sequences was found to encode a protein that contained two transmembrane domains and, therefore, may be a transmembrane protein. here, we proposed that this novel unigene may encode a virus receptor or a protein that mediates the immune signalling pathway at the cell surface.


CONCLUSIONS
this study enriches the molecular basis data of grass carp and further confirms that, based on fish tissue-specific est databases, transcriptome analysis is an effective route to discover novel functional genes.
