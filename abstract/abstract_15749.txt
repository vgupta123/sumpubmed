BACKGROUND
long interspersed element- <dig>  is the only autonomously active, transposable element in the human genome. l <dig> sequences comprise approximately 17 % of the human genome, but only the evolutionarily recent, human-specific subfamily is retrotransposition competent. the l <dig> promoter has a bidirectional orientation containing a sense promoter that drives the transcription of two proteins required for retrotransposition and an antisense promoter. the l <dig> antisense promoter can drive transcription of chimeric transcripts: 5’ l <dig> antisense sequences spliced to the exons of neighboring genes.


RESULTS
the impact of l <dig> antisense promoter activity on cellular transcriptomes is poorly understood. to investigate this, we analyzed genbank ests for messenger rnas that initiate in the l <dig> antisense promoter. we identified  <dig> putative l <dig> antisense chimeric transcripts,  <dig> of which have not been previously reported. these appear to be alternative genic transcripts, sense-oriented with respect to gene and initiating near, but typically downstream of, the gene transcriptional start site. in multiple cell lines, l <dig> antisense promoters display enrichment for yy <dig> transcription factor and histone modifications associated with active promoters. global run-on sequencing data support the activity of the l <dig> antisense promoter. we independently detected 124 l <dig> antisense chimeric transcripts using long read pacific biosciences rna-seq data. furthermore, we validated four chimeric transcripts by quantitative rt-pcr and sanger sequencing and demonstrated that they are readily detectable in many normal human tissues.


CONCLUSIONS
we present a comprehensive characterization of human l <dig> antisense promoter-driven transcripts and provide substantial evidence that they are transcribed in a variety of human cell-types. our findings reveal a new wide-reaching aspect of l <dig> biology by identifying antisense transcripts affecting as many as 4 % of all human genes.
