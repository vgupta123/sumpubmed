BACKGROUND
cc-family chemokine receptor  <dig>  is implicated in the trafficking of blood-borne monocytes to sites of inflammation and is implicated in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and atherosclerosis. the major challenge in the development of small molecule chemokine receptor antagonists is the lack of cross-species activity to the receptor in the preclinical species. rabbit models have been widely used to study the role of various inflammatory molecules in the development of inflammatory processes. therefore, in this study, we report the cloning and characterization of rabbit ccr <dig>  data regarding the activity of the ccr <dig> antagonist will provide valuable tools to perform toxicology and efficacy studies in the rabbit model.


RESULTS
sequence alignment indicated that rabbit ccr <dig> shares  <dig> % identity to human ccr2b. tissue distribution indicated that rabbit ccr <dig> is abundantly expressed in spleen and lung. recombinant rabbit ccr <dig> expressed as stable transfectants in u- <dig> cells binds radiolabeled 125i-mouse je  with a calculated kd of  <dig>  nm. in competition binding assays, binding of radiolabeled mouse je to rabbit ccr <dig> is differentially competed by human mcp- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  but not by rantes, mip-1α or mip-1β. u-937/rabbit ccr <dig> stable transfectants undergo chemotaxis in response to both human mcp- <dig> and mouse je with potencies comparable to those reported for human ccr2b. finally, tak- <dig>  a dual ccr2/ccr <dig> antagonist effectively inhibits the binding of 125i-mouse je  to rabbit ccr <dig> and effectively blocks ccr2-mediated chemotaxis.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we report the cloning of rabbit ccr <dig> and demonstrate that this receptor is a functional chemotactic receptor for mcp- <dig>
