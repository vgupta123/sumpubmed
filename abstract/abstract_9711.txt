BACKGROUND
motor activity during vicarious experience of actions is a widely reported and studied phenomenon, and motor system activity also accompanies observation of graspable objects in the absence of any actions. such motor activity is thought to reflect simulation of the observed action, or preparation to interact with the object, respectively.


RESULTS
here, in an initial exploratory study, we ask whether motor activity during observation of object directed actions is involved in processes related to recognition of the object after initial exposure. single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation  was applied over the thumb representation of the motor cortex, or over the vertex, during observation of a model thumb typing on a cell-phone, and performance on a phone recognition task at the end of the trial was assessed. disrupting motor processing over the thumb representation 100Â ms after the onset of the typing video impaired the ability to recognize the phone in the recognition test, whereas there was no such effect for tms applied over the vertex and no tms trials. furthermore, this effect only manifested for videos observed from the first person perspective. in an additional control condition, there was no evidence for any effects of tms to the thumb representation or vertex when observing and recognizing non-action related shape stimuli.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, these data provide evidence that motor cortical processing during observation of object-directed actions from a first person perspective is causally linked to the formation of enduring representations of objects-of-action.
