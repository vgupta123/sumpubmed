BACKGROUND
nucleolar ribosomal dna is tightly associated with silent heterochromatin, which is important for rdna stability, nucleolar integration and cellular senescence. two pathways have been described that lead to rdna silencing in yeast: 1) the rent  complex, which is composed of net <dig>  sir <dig> and cdc <dig> and is required for sir2-dependent rdna silencing; and 2) the sir2-independent silencing mechanism, which involves the tof <dig> and tof2-copurified complex, made up of lrs <dig> and csm <dig>  here, we present evidence that changes in histone h <dig> lysine methylation levels distinctly regulate rdna silencing by recruiting different silencing proteins to rdna, thereby contributing to rdna silencing and nucleolar organization in yeast.


RESULTS
we found that lys <dig>  lys <dig> and lys <dig> methylation within histone h <dig> acts as a bivalent marker for the regulation of rdna recombination and rent complex-mediated rdna silencing, both of which are sir2-dependent pathways. by contrast, we found that jhd <dig>  an evolutionarily conserved jarid <dig> family h <dig> lys <dig> demethylase, affects all states of methylated h3k <dig> within the nontranscribed spacer  regions of rdna and that its activity is required for the regulation of rdna silencing in a sir2-independent manner. in this context, jhd <dig> regulates rdna recombination through the tof2/csm1/lrs <dig> pathway and prevents excessive recruitment of tof <dig>  csm1/lrs <dig> and condensin subunits to the replication fork barrier site within the nts <dig> region. our fish analyses further demonstrate that the demethylase activity of jhd <dig> regulates mitotic rdna condensation and that jhd2-deficient cells contain the mostly hypercondensed rdna mislocalized away from the nuclear periphery.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that yeast jhd <dig>  which demethylates histone h <dig> lys <dig> near the rdna locus, regulates rdna repeat stability and rdna silencing in a sir2-independent manner by maintaining csm1/lrs <dig> and condensin association with rdna regions during mitosis. these data suggest that jhd2-mediated alleviation of excessive csm1/lrs <dig> or condensin at the nts <dig> region of rdna is required for the integrity of rdna repeats and proper rdna silencing during mitosis.
