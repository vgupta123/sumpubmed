BACKGROUND
previous studies suggest that human rad <dig> , encoding a dna damage checkpoint molecule, which is frequently amplified in epithelial tumor cells of breast, lung, head and neck cancer, participates in regulation of the tumor suppressor p53-dependent transactivation of pro-survival p21waf <dig>  this study examined the exact mechanism of the hrad <dig> function, especially through the phosphorylation of the c-terminus, in the transcription regulation of p21waf <dig> 


RESULTS
the transfection of phosphorylation-defective hrad <dig> mutants of c-terminus resulted in reduction of the p53-dependent p21waf <dig> transactivation; the knockdown of total hrad <dig> elicited an increased p21waf <dig> mrna expression. immunoprecipitation and a chip assay showed that hrad <dig> and p <dig> formed a complex and both were associated with two p53-consensus dna-binding sequences in the 5' region of p21waf <dig> gene. the association was reduced in the experiment of phosphorylation-defective hrad <dig> mutants.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study indicates the direct involvement of hrad <dig> in the p53-dependent p21waf <dig> transcriptional mechanism, presumably via the phosphorylation sites, and alterations of the hrad <dig> pathway might therefore contribute to the perturbation of checkpoint activation in cancer cells.
