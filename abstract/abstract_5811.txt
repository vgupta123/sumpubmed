BACKGROUND
requisites for an efficacious tuberculosis  vaccine are a minimal genomic diversity among infectious mycobacterium tuberculosis strains for the selected antigen, and the capability to induce robust t-cell responses in the majority of human populations. a tool in the identification of putative t-cell epitopes is in silico prediction of major histocompatibility complex -peptide binding. candidate tb vaccine antigen mtb72f and its successor m <dig> are recombinant fusion proteins derived from mtb32a and mtb39a . adjuvanted mtb72f and m <dig> candidate vaccines were shown to induce cd4+ t-cell responses in european, us, african and asian populations.

methods
sequence conservation of mtb32a, mtb39a, mtb72f and m <dig> among  <dig> strains  was assessed by multiple alignments using clustalx. for mtb32a, mtb39a and mtb72f, 15-mer human leukocyte antigen -class ii-binding peptides were predicted for  <dig> drb <dig> alleles prevailing in populations with high tb burden,  <dig> drb3/4/ <dig>   <dig> dq and  <dig> dp alleles, using netmhcii-pan- <dig> . results for  <dig> drb <dig> alleles were compared with previously published allele-matched in vitro binding data. additional analyses were done for m <dig>  nonameric mhc class i-binding peptides in mtb72f were predicted for three alleles representative of class i supertypes a <dig>  a <dig> and b <dig>  using seven prediction algorithms.


RESULTS
sequence identity among strains was ≥98 % for each protein. residue changes in mtb39a comprised primarily single residue or nucleotide insertions and/or deletions in repeat regions, and were observed in 67 % of strains. for mtb72f,  <dig> drb <dig>   <dig> drb3/4/ <dig>   <dig> dq and  <dig> dp alleles were predicted to contain at least one mhc class ii-binding peptide, and class i-binding peptides were predicted for each hla-a/b allele. comparison of predicted mhc-ii-binding peptides with experimental data indicated that the algorithm’s sensitivity and specificity were variable among alleles.


CONCLUSIONS
the sequences from which mtb72f and m <dig> are derived are highly conserved among representative mycobacterium strains. predicted putative t-cell epitopes in m <dig> and/or mtb72f covered a wide array of hla alleles. in silico binding predictions for class i- and ii-binding putative epitopes can be complemented with biochemical verification of hla binding capacity, processing and immunogenicity of the predicted peptides.
