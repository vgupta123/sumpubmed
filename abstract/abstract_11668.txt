BACKGROUND

mycoplasma hyopneumoniae  and porcine circovirus type  <dig>  are major pathogens that cause significant health problems in swine worldwide. maternal derived immunity  has been suggested as a significant immediate defence factor for newborn piglets and may interfere with piglet’s vaccination-induced immunity. the study aimed to assess the efficacy of a novel combination vaccine , against pcv <dig> and m. hyo natural infection , in the presence of strong maternally derived pcv <dig> immunity , under field conditions. the study was performed according to a controlled, randomized and blinded design in a greek swine unit with enzootic pneumonia  and subclinical pcv <dig> infection. in total,  <dig> healthy three-week-old suckling piglets were allocated randomly, either to treatment  or control group .


RESULTS
vaccination significantly reduced the severity of lung lesions at slaughter  . the overall mean lung lesion score  was  <dig>  in the vaccinated group and  <dig>  in controls. the level of pcv <dig> viraemia was significantly reduced in vaccinated pigs. furthermore, 25 g higher average daily weight gain  was observed during the finishing phase  and 18 g greater adwg overall .


CONCLUSIONS
results of lls, pcv <dig> viremia and adwg support the test product’s efficacy in the face of strong maternally derived pcv <dig> immunity.
