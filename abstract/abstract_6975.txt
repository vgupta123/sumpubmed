BACKGROUND
the contamination of raw milk cheeses  from two plants in france was studied at several steps of production  using bifidobacteria as indicators of fecal contamination.


RESULTS
bifidobacterium semi-quantitative counts were compared using pcr-rflp and real-time pcr. b. pseudolongum were detected in 77%  and 68%  of st-marcellin samples and in 87%  of brie cheeses samples. mean counts of b. pseudolongum remained stable along both processes. two other populations of bifidobacteria were detected during the ripening stage of st-marcellin, respectively in 61% and 18% of the samples . the presence of these populations explains the increase in total bifidobacteria observed during ripening. further characterization of these populations is currently under process. forty-eight percents  and 70%  of the samples were b. pseudolongum positive/e. coli negative while only 10%  and 3%  were b. pseudolongum negative/e. coli positive.


CONCLUSIONS
the increase of total bifidobacteria during ripening in marcellin's process does not allow their use as fecal indicator. the presence of b. pseudolongum along the processes defined a contamination from animal origin since this species is predominant in cow dung and has never been isolated in human feces. b. pseudolongum was more sensitive as an indicator than e. coli along the two different cheese processes. b. pseudolongum should be used as fecal indicator rather than e. coli to assess the quality of raw milk and raw milk cheeses.
