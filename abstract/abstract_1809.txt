BACKGROUND
as next-generation sequencing technology made rapid and cost-effective sequencing available, the importance of computational approaches in finding and analyzing copy number variations  has been amplified. furthermore, most genome projects need to accurately analyze sequences with fairly low-coverage read data. it is urgently needed to develop a method to detect the exact types and locations of cnvs from low coverage read data.


RESULTS
here, we propose a new cnv detection method, cnv_ss, which uses scale-space filtering. the scale-space filtering is evaluated by applying to the read coverage data the gaussian convolution for various scales according to a given scaling parameter. next, by differentiating twice and finding zero-crossing points, inflection points of scale-space filtered read coverage data are calculated per scale. then, the types and the exact locations of cnvs are obtained by analyzing the finger print map, the contours of zero-crossing points for various scales.


CONCLUSIONS
the performance of cnv_ss showed that fnr and fpr stay in the range of  <dig> % to  <dig> % and  <dig> % to  <dig> %, respectively, even at a relatively low coverage . cnv_ss gave also much more effective results than the conventional methods in the evaluation of fnr, at  <dig> % at least and  <dig> % at most even when the coverage level of read data is low. cnv_ss source code is freely available from http://dblab.hallym.ac.kr/cnv ss/.
