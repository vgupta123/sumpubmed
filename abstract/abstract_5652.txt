BACKGROUND
solution-based targeted genomic enrichment  protocols permit selective sequencing of genomic regions of interest on a massively parallel scale. these protocols could be improved by: 1) modifying or eliminating time consuming steps; 2) increasing yield to reduce input dna and excessive pcr cycling; and 3) enhancing reproducible.


RESULTS
we developed a solution-based tge method for downstream illumina sequencing in a non-automated workflow, adding standard illumina barcode indexes during the post-hybridization amplification to allow for sample pooling prior to sequencing. the method utilizes agilent sureselect baits, primers and hybridization reagents for the capture, off-the-shelf reagents for the library preparation steps, and adaptor oligonucleotides for illumina paired-end sequencing purchased directly from an oligonucleotide manufacturing company.


CONCLUSIONS
this solution-based tge method for illumina sequencing is optimized for small- or medium-sized laboratories and addresses the weaknesses of standard protocols by reducing the amount of input dna required, increasing capture yield, optimizing efficiency, and improving reproducibility.
