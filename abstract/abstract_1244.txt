BACKGROUND
within the last decade, macrophages have been shown to be capable of differentiating toward a classically activated phenotype  with a high antimicrobial potential or an alternatively activated phenotype . some pathogens are capable of interfering with differentiation in order to down-regulate the anti-microbial activity and enhance their survival in the host.


RESULTS
to test this ability in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, we infected porcine alveolar macrophages with wild-type salmonella typhimurium and its isogenic mutants devoid of two major pathogenicity islands, spi- <dig> and spi- <dig>  the induction of genes linked with m <dig> or m <dig> polarization was determined by quantification of gene expression by rt-qpcr. the Δspi- <dig> mutant induced a high, dose-dependent m <dig> response but a low m <dig> response in infected macrophages. on the other hand, wild-type salmonella typhimurium induced a low m <dig> response but a high, dose-dependent m <dig> response in infected macrophages. the response to Δspi- <dig> mutant infection was virtually the same as the wild-type strain.


CONCLUSIONS
we therefore propose that salmonella typhimurium dt <dig> studied here can polarize macrophages towards the less bactericidal m <dig> phenotype and that this polarization is dependent on the type iii secretion system encoded by spi- <dig>
