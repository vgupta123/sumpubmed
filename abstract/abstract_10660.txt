BACKGROUND
small non-coding rnas  are emerging as major components of the cellâ€™s regulatory network, several possessing their own regulons. a few srnas have been reported as being involved in general or toxic-metabolite stress, mostly in gram- prokaryotes, but hardly any in gram+ prokaryotes. significantly, the role of srnas in the stress response remains poorly understood at the genome-scale level. it was previously shown that toxic-metabolite stress is one of the most comprehensive and encompassing stress responses in the cell, engaging both the general stress  response as well as specialized metabolic programs.


RESULTS
using rna deep sequencing  we examined the srnome of c. acetobutylicum in response to the native but toxic metabolites, butanol and butyrate.  <dig> % of the rna-seq reads mapped to genome outside annotated orfs, thus demonstrating the richness and importance of the small rnome. we used comparative expression analysis of  <dig> srnas we had previously computationally predicted, and of annotated mrnas to set metrics for reliably identifying srnas from rna-seq data, thus discovering  <dig> additional srnas. under metabolite stress, these  <dig> srnas displayed distinct expression patterns, a select number of which was verified by northern analysis. we identified stress-related expression of srnas affecting transcriptional  and translational  processes, and  <dig> likely targets of the rna chaperone hfq.


CONCLUSIONS
our results support an important role for srnas for understanding the complexity of the regulatory network that underlies the stress response in clostridium organisms, whether related to normophysiology, pathogenesis or biotechnological applications.
