BACKGROUND
cost-effective production of industrially important enzymes is a key for their successful exploitation on industrial scale. keeping in view the extensive industrial applications of lignin peroxidase , this study was performed to purify and characterize the lip from an indigenous strain of trametes versicolor ibl- <dig>  xerogel matrix enzyme immobilization technique was applied to improve the kinetic and thermo-stability characteristics of lip to fulfil the requirements of the modern enzyme consumer sector of biotechnology.


RESULTS
a novel lip was isolated from an indigenous t. versicolor ibl- <dig> strain. t. versicolor ibl- <dig> was cultured in solid state fermentation  medium of corn cobs and maximum lip activity of 592 ±  <dig> u/ml was recorded after five days of incubation under optimum culture conditions. the crude lip was  <dig> -fold purified with specific activity of  <dig> u/mg after passing through the deae-cellulose and sephadex-g- <dig> chromatography columns. the purified lip exhibited a relatively low molecular weight  homogenous single band on native and sds-page. the lip was immobilized by entrapping in xerogel matrix of trimethoxysilane  and proplytetramethoxysilane  and maximum immobilization efficiency of  <dig> % was achieved. the free and immobilized lips were characterized and the results showed that the free and immobilized lips had optimum ph  <dig> and  <dig> while optimum temperatures were 60°c and 80°c, respectively. immobilization was found to enhance the activity and thermo-stability potential of lip significantly and immobilized lip remained stable over broad ph and temperature range as compare to free enzyme. kinetic constants km and vmax were  <dig> and 56 μm and  <dig> and  <dig> u/mg for the free and immobilized lips, respectively. activity of this novel extra thermo-stable lip was stimulated to variable extents by cu2+, mn2+ and fe2+ whereas, cystein, edta and ag+ showed inhibitory effects.


CONCLUSIONS
the indigenously isolated white rot fungal strain t. versicolor ibl- <dig> showed tremendous potential for lip synthesis in ssf of corncobs in high titters  than other reported trametes  species. the results obtained after dual phase characterization suggested xerogel matrix entrapment a promising tool for enzyme immobilization, hyper-activation and stabilization against high temperature and inactivating agents. the ph and temperature optima, extra thermo-stability features and kinetic characteristics of this novel lip of t. versicolor ibl- <dig> make it a versatile enzyme for various industrial and biotechnological applications.
