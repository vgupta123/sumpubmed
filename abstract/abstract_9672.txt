BACKGROUND
nep1-like proteins  are a novel family of microbial elicitors of plant necrosis. some nlps induce a hypersensitive-like response in dicot plants though the basis for this response remains unclear. in addition, the spatial structure and the role of these highly conserved proteins are not known.


RESULTS
we predict a 3d-structure for the Î²-rich section of the nlps based on alignments, prediction tools and molecular dynamics. we calculated a consensus sequence from  <dig> nlps proteins, predicted its secondary structure and obtained a high quality alignment of this structure and conserved residues with the two cupin superfamily motifs. the conserved sequence ghrhdwe and several common residues, especially some conserved histidines, in nlps match closely the two cupin motifs. besides other common residues shared by dicot auxin-binding proteins  and nlps, an additional conserved histidine found in all dicot abps was also found in all nlps at the same position.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that the necrosis inducing protein class belongs to the cupin superfamily. based on the 3d-structure, we are proposing some possible functions for the nlps.
