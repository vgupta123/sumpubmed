BACKGROUND
the green algal genus ulva linnaeus  is well known for its wide distribution in marine, freshwater, and brackish environments throughout the world. the ulva species are also highly tolerant of variations in salinity, temperature, and irradiance and are the main cause of green tides, which can have deleterious ecological effects. however, limited genomic information is currently available in this non-model and ecologically important species. ulva linza is a species that inhabits bedrock in the mid to low intertidal zone, and it is a major contributor to biofouling. here, we presented the global characterization of the u. linza transcriptome using the roche gs flx titanium platform, with the aim of uncovering the genomic mechanisms underlying rapid and successful colonization of the coastal ecosystems.


RESULTS
de novo assembly of  <dig>  reads generated  <dig>  contigs with an average length of  <dig>  bases. contiguous sequences were further assembled into  <dig>  isotigs with an average length of  <dig>  bases. a total of  <dig>  reads were nominally identified by blast;  <dig>  isotigs were functionally annotated with  <dig>  go terms, and  <dig>  isotigs having enzyme commission  numbers were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways. when compared with four other full sequenced green algae,  <dig>  unique isotigs were found in u. linza and  <dig> conserved in land plants. in addition, a specific photoprotective mechanism based on both lhcsr and psbs proteins and a c4-like carbon-concentrating mechanism were found, which may help u. linza survive stress conditions. at least  <dig> transporters for essential inorganic nutrients  were responsible for its ability to take up inorganic nutrients, and at least  <dig> eukaryotic cytochrome p450s, which is a higher number than that found in other algae, may be related to their strong allelopathy. multi-origination of the stress related proteins, such as glutamate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutases, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase and heat-shock proteins, may also contribute to colonization of u. linza under stress conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptome of u. linza uncovers some potential genomic mechanisms that might explain its ability to rapidly and successfully colonize coastal ecosystems, including the land-specific genes; special photoprotective mechanism based on both lhcsr and psbs; development of c4-like carbon-concentrating mechanisms; muti-origin transporters for essential inorganic nutrients; multiple and complex p450s; and glutamate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutases, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, and heat-shock proteins that are related to stress resistance.
