BACKGROUND
signaling pathways outside dopamine d <dig> receptor antagonism may govern the variable clinical profile of antipsychotic drugs  in schizophrenia. one postulated mechanism causal to apd action may regulate synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase  cascade that links g-protein coupled receptors  and erbb growth factor signaling, systems disturbed in schizophrenia. this was based upon our finding that the low d <dig> receptor affinity apd clozapine induced initial down-regulation and delayed epidermal growth factor receptor  mediated activation of the cortical and striatal erk response in vivo distinct from olanzapine or haloperidol. here we map whether the second generation atypical apds aripiprazole and quetiapine affect the egfr-erk pathway and its substrates p90rsk and c-fos in mouse brain, given their divergent agonist and antagonist properties on dopaminergic transmission, respectively.


RESULTS
in prefrontal cortex, aripiprazole triggered triphasic erk phosphorylation that was egfr-independent but had no significant effect in striatum. conversely quetiapine did not alter cortical erk signaling but elevated striatal erk levels in an egfr-dependent manner. induction of erk by aripiprazole did not affect p90rsk signaling but quetiapine decreased rsk phosphorylation within 1-hour of administration. the transcription factor c-fos by comparison was a direct target of erk phosphorylation induced by aripiprazole in cortex and quetiapine in striatum with protein levels in temporal alignment with that of erk.


CONCLUSIONS
these data indicate that aripiprazole and quetiapine signal to specific nuclear targets of erk, which for quetiapine occurs via an egfr-linked mechanism, possibly indicating involvement of this system in its action.
