BACKGROUND
the positioning of genes in the genome is an important evolutionary degree of freedom for organizing gene regulation. statistical properties of these distributions have been studied particularly in relation to the transcriptional regulatory network. the systematics of gene-gene distances then become important sources of information on the control, which different biological mechanisms exert on gene expression.


RESULTS
here we study a set of categories, which has to our knowledge not been analyzed before. we distinguish between genes that do not participate in the transcriptional regulatory network , and genes that via transcription factors either are regulated by or regulate other genes. we find that the two types of genes  show a clear statistical repulsion and have different ranges of correlations. in particular we find that isolated genes have a preference for shorter intergenic distances.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings support previous evidence from gene expression patterns for two distinct logical types of control, namely digital control  and analog control .
