BACKGROUND
the genus corynebacterium includes gram-positive microorganisms of great biotechnologically importance, such as corynebacterium glutamicum and corynebacterium efficiens, as well as serious human pathogens, such as corynebacterium diphtheriae and corynebacterium jeikeium. although genome sequences of the respective species have been determined recently, the knowledge about the repertoire of transcriptional regulators and the architecture of global regulatory networks is scarce. here, we apply a combination of bioinformatic tools and a comparative genomic approach to identify and characterize a set of conserved dna-binding transcriptional regulators in the four corynebacterial genomes.


RESULTS
a collection of  <dig> dna-binding transcriptional regulators was identified in the c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> genome, whereas  <dig> regulators were detected in c. efficiens ys- <dig>   <dig> in c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig> and  <dig> in c. jeikeium k <dig>  according to amino acid sequence similarities and protein structure predictions, the dna-binding transcriptional regulators were grouped into  <dig> regulatory protein families. the common set of dna-binding transcriptional regulators present in the four corynebacterial genomes consists of  <dig> proteins that are apparently involved in the regulation of cell division and septation, sos and stress response, carbohydrate metabolism and macroelement and metal homeostasis.


CONCLUSIONS
this work describes characteristic features of a set of conserved dna-binding transcriptional regulators present within the corynebacterial core genome. the knowledge on the physiological function of these proteins should not only contribute to our understanding of the regulation of gene expression but will also provide the basis for comprehensive modeling of transcriptional regulatory networks of these species.
