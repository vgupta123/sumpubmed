BACKGROUND
the common ancestor of salmonid fishes, including rainbow trout , experienced a whole genome duplication between  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago, and many of the duplicated genes have been retained in the trout genome. this retention complicates efforts to detect allelic variation in salmonid fishes. specifically, single nucleotide polymorphism  detection is problematic because nucleotide variation can be found between the duplicate copies  of a gene as well as between alleles.


RESULTS
we present a method of differentiating between allelic and paralogous  sequence variants, allowing identification of snps in organisms with multiple copies of a gene or set of genes. the basic strategy is to: 1) identify windows of unique cdna sequences with homology to each other, 2) compare these unique cdnas if they are not shared between individuals , and 3) give a “snp score” value between zero and one to each candidate sequence variant based on six criteria. using this strategy we were able to detect about seven thousand potential snps from the transcriptomes of several clonal lines of rainbow trout. when directly compared to a pre-validated set of snps in polyploid wheat, we were also able to estimate the false-positive rate of this strategy as  <dig> to 28% depending on parameters used.


CONCLUSIONS
this strategy has an advantage over traditional techniques of snp identification because another dimension of sequencing information is utilized. this method is especially well suited for identifying snps in polyploids, both outbred and inbred, but would tend to be conservative for diploid organisms.
