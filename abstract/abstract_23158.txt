BACKGROUND
krüppel-like factor  <dig>  is a broadly expressed zinc-finger transcriptional repressor with diverse biological roles. during erythropoiesis, klf <dig> acts as a feedback repressor of a set of genes that are activated by krüppel-like factor  <dig> . noting that klf <dig> binds α-globin gene regulatory sequences during erythroid maturation, we sought to determine whether klf <dig> also interacts with the α-globin locus to regulate transcription.


RESULTS
we found that expression of a human transgenic α-globin reporter gene is markedly up-regulated in fetal and adult erythroid cells of klf3−/− mice. inspection of the mouse and human α-globin promoters revealed a number of canonical klf-binding sites, and indeed, klf <dig> was shown to bind to these regions both in vitro and in vivo. despite these observations, we did not detect an increase in endogenous murine α-globin expression in klf3
−/−
 erythroid tissue. however, examination of murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking klf <dig> revealed significant de-repression of α-globin gene expression. this suggests that klf <dig> may contribute to the silencing of the α-globin locus in non-erythroid tissue. moreover, chip-seq analysis of murine fibroblasts demonstrated that across the locus, klf <dig> does not occupy the promoter regions of the α-globin genes in these cells, but rather, binds to upstream, dnase hypersensitive regulatory regions.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings reveal that the occupancy profile of klf <dig> at the α-globin locus differs in erythroid and non-erythroid cells. in erythroid cells, klf <dig> primarily binds to the promoters of the adult α-globin genes, but appears dispensable for normal transcriptional regulation. in non-erythroid cells, klf <dig> distinctly binds to the hs- <dig> and hs- <dig> elements and plays a non-redundant, albeit modest, role in the silencing of α-globin expression.
