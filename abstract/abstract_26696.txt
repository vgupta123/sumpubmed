BACKGROUND
enterobacter sakazakii is the causative agent of rare but severe food-borne infections associated with meningitis, necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis in infants. rehydrated powdered infant formulae have been implicated as the source of infection in several outbreaks and sporadic cases. in this work, a real time fluorescence resonance energy transfer pcr assay incorporating an internal amplification control  was developed for the specific detection of e. sakazakii in foods. performance of the assay, coupled to an automated dna extraction system and the e. sakazakii iso-idf  enrichment procedure, was evaluated on infant formulae and samples from production environment.


RESULTS
the real-time pcr assay had 100% specificity as assessed using  <dig> e. sakazakii and  <dig> non-e. sakazakii strains. according to the e. sakazakii strains tested, the detection limits ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> genomic copies. assays on pure cultures  gave a sensitivity of about  <dig> to  <dig> cfu/ml. out of  <dig> naturally contaminated infant formulae and environmental samples analysed for the presence of e. sakazakii,  <dig> were positive by real-time pcr and  <dig> by the conventional culture method, giving  <dig> % concordance with the iso-idf reference method.


CONCLUSIONS
this method, combining specific real-time pcr, automated dna extraction and iso-idf standard enrichments, provides a useful tool for rapid screening of e. sakazakii in food and environmental matrices.
