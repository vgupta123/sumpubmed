BACKGROUND
divergently-paired genes  are defined as two adjacent genes that are transcribed toward the opposite direction  and shared their transcription start sites  less than  <dig>  base pairs apart. dpgs are products of a common organizational feature among eukaryotic genes yet to be surveyed across divergent genomes over well-defined evolutionary distances since mutations in the sequence between a pair of dpgs may result in alternations in shared promoters and thus affect the function of both genes. by sharing promoters, the gene pairs take the advantage of co-regulation albeit bearing doubled mutational burdens in maintaining their normal functions.


RESULTS
drosophila melanogaster has a significant fraction  of dpgs which are remarkably conserved relative to its gene density as compared to other eukaryotes. our survey and comparative analysis revealed different evolutionary patterns among dpgs between insect and vertebrate lineages. the conservation of dpgs in d. melanogaster is of significance as they are mostly housekeeping genes characterized by the absence of tata box in their promoter sequences. the combination of initiator and downstream promoter element may play an important role in regulating dpgs in d. melanogaster, providing an excellent niche for studying the molecular details for transcription regulations.


CONCLUSIONS
dpgs appear to have arisen independently among different evolutionary lineages, such as the insect and vertebrate lineages, and exhibit variable degrees of conservation. such architectural organizations, including convergently-paired genes  may associate with transcriptional regulation and have significant functional relevance.
