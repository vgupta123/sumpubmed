BACKGROUND
the majority of experimentally determined crystal structures of type ii restriction endonucleases  exhibit a common pd-xk fold. crystal structures have been also determined for single representatives of two other folds: pld  and half-pipe , and bioinformatics analyses supported by mutagenesis suggested that some reases belong to the hnh fold. our previous bioinformatic analysis suggested that rease r.eco29ki shares sequence similarities with one more unrelated nuclease superfamily, giy-yig, however so far no experimental data were available to support this prediction. the determination of a crystal structure of the giy-yig domain of homing endonuclease i-tevi provided a template for modeling of r.eco29ki and prompted us to validate the model experimentally.


RESULTS
using protein fold-recognition methods we generated a new alignment between r.eco29ki and i-tevi, which suggested a reassignment of one of the putative catalytic residues. a theoretical model of r.eco29ki was constructed to illustrate its predicted three-dimensional fold and organization of the active site, comprising amino acid residues y <dig>  y <dig>  r <dig>  h <dig>  e <dig>  and n <dig>  a series of mutants was constructed to generate amino acid substitutions of selected residues  and the mutant proteins were examined for their ability to bind the dna containing the eco29ki site 5'-ccgcgg-3' and to catalyze the cleavage reaction. experimental data reveal that residues y <dig>  r <dig>  e <dig>  h <dig>  and n <dig> are important for the nuclease activity of r.eco29ki, while h <dig> and n <dig> are also important for specific dna binding by this enzyme.


CONCLUSIONS
substitutions of residues y <dig>  r <dig>  h <dig>  e <dig> and n <dig> predicted by the model to be a part of the active site lead to mutant proteins with strong defects in the rease activity. these results are in very good agreement with the structural model presented in this work and with our prediction that r.eco29ki belongs to the giy-yig superfamily of nucleases. our study provides the first experimental evidence for a type iip rease that does not belong to the pd-xk or hnh superfamilies of nucleases, and is instead a member of the unrelated giy-yig superfamily.
