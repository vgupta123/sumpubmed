BACKGROUND
activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase , a member of mitogen-activated protein kinase  family, has been proposed to mediate neurite outgrowth-promoting effects of several neurotrophic factors in vitro. however, the precise activity of erk during axonal regeneration in vivo remains unclear. peripheral axotomy has been shown to activate erk in the cell bodies of primary afferent neurons and associated satellite cells. nevertheless, whether erk is also activated in the axons and surrounded schwann cells which also play a key role in the regeneration process has not been clarified.


RESULTS
phosphorylation of erk in the sciatic nerve in several time-points after crush injury has been examined. higher phosphorylation of erk was observed in the proximal and distal nerve stumps compared to the contralateral intact nerve from one day to one month after crush. the activation of erk was mainly localized in the axons of the proximal segments. in the distal segments, however, active erk was predominantly found in schwann cells forming bungner's bands.


CONCLUSIONS
the findings indicate that erk is activated in both the proximal and distal nerve stumps following nerve injury. the role of activated erk in wallerian degeneration and subsequent regeneration in vivo remains to be elucidated.
