BACKGROUND
persistent infection of penaeus stylirostris densovirus   and its non-infectious inserts in the black tiger shrimp, penaeus monodon  genome are commonly found without apparent disease. here, we introduced the method of multiplex pcr in order to differentiate shrimp with viral inserts from ones with the infectious virus. the method allowed us to study the effect of pre-infection of ihhnv, in comparison to ihhnv inserts, on wssv resistance in p. monodon.


RESULTS
a multiplex pcr system was developed to amplify the entire ihhnv genome, ensuring the accurate diagnosis. field samples containing ihhnv dna templates as low as 20Â pg or equivalent  <dig> viral copies can be detected by this method. by challenging the two groups of diagnosed shrimp with wssv, we found that shrimp with ihhnv infection and those with viral inserts responded to wssv differently. considering cumulative mortality, average time to death of shrimp in ihhnv-infected group  was significantly delayed relative to that  of ihhnv-inserted group. real-time pcr analysis of wssv copy number indicated the lower amount of wssv in the ihhnv-infected group than the virus-inserted group. the ratio of ihhnv: wssv copy number in all determined ihhnv-infected samples ranged from approximately  <dig> to 300-fold.


CONCLUSIONS
the multiplex pcr assay developed herein proved optimal for convenient differentiation of shrimp specimens with real ihhnv infection and those with insert types. diagnosed shrimp were also found to exhibit different wssv tolerance. after exposed to wssv, the naturally pre-infected ihhnv p. monodon were less susceptible to wssv and, consequently, survived longer than the ihhnv-inserted shrimp.
