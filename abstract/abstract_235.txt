BACKGROUND
two main genes encoding the catalytic subunits cα and cβ of cyclic amp dependent protein kinase  have been identified in all vertebrates examined. the murine, bovine and human cβ genes encode several splice variants, including the splice variant cβ <dig>  in mouse cβ <dig> has a relative molecular mass of  <dig> kda and is only expressed in the brain. in human and bovine cβ <dig> has a relative molecular mass of  <dig> kda and is mainly expressed in lymphoid tissues.


RESULTS
we identified a novel  <dig> kda splice variant encoded by the mouse cβ gene that is highly expressed in lymphoid cells. cloning, expression, and production of a sequence-specific antiserum and characterization of pka catalytic subunit activities demonstrated the  <dig> kda protein to be a catalytically active murine homologue of human and bovine cβ <dig>  based on the present results and the existence of a human brain-specifically expressed cβ splice variant designated cβ <dig> that is identical to the former mouse cβ <dig> splice variant, the mouse splice variant has now been renamed mouse cβ <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
murine lymphoid tissues express a protein that is a homologue of human and bovine cβ <dig>  the murine cβ gene encodes the splice variants cβ <dig>  cβ <dig>  cβ <dig> and cβ <dig>  as is the case with the human cβ gene.
