BACKGROUND
the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone binding protein  is an important functional protein, which is involved in protein synthesis, folding assembly, and secretion. in order to study the role of bip in the process of wheat seed development, we cloned three bip homologous cdna sequences in bread wheat , completed by rapid amplification of cdna ends , and examined the expression of wheat bip in wheat tissues, particularly the relationship between bip expression and the subunit types of hmw-gs using near-isogenic lines  of hmw-gs silencing, and under abiotic stress.


RESULTS
sequence analysis demonstrated that all bips contained three highly conserved domains present in plants, animals, and microorganisms, indicating their evolutionary conservation among different biological species. quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  revealed that tabip  expression was not organ-specific, but was predominantly localized to seed endosperm. furthermore, immunolocalization confirmed that tabip was primarily located within the protein bodies  in wheat endosperm. three tabip genes exhibited significantly down-regulated expression following high molecular weight-glutenin subunit  silencing. drought stress induced significantly up-regulated expression of tabips in wheat roots, leaves, and developing grains.


CONCLUSIONS
the high conservation of bip sequences suggests that bip plays the same role, or has common mechanisms, in the folding and assembly of nascent polypeptides and protein synthesis across species. the expression of tabips in different wheat tissue and under abiotic stress indicated that tabip is most abundant in tissues with high secretory activity and with high proportions of cells undergoing division, and that the expression level of bip is associated with the subunit types of hmw-gs and synthesis. the expression of tabips is developmentally regulated during seed development and early seedling growth, and under various abiotic stresses.
