BACKGROUND
adiponectin is a key mediator of the metabolic syndrome that is caused by visceral fat accumulation. adiponectin and its receptors are known to be expressed in osteoblasts, but their actions with regard to bone metabolism are still unclear. in this study, we investigated the effects of adiponectin on the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of osteoblastic mc3t3-e <dig> cells.


RESULTS
adiponectin receptor type  <dig>  mrna was detected in the cells by rt-pcr. the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase  was phosphorylated by both adiponectin and a pharmacological amp kinase activator, 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide-riboside , in the cells. adipor <dig> small interfering rna  transfection potently knocked down the receptor mrna, and the effect of this knockdown persisted for as long as  <dig> days after the transfection. the transfected cells showed decreased expressions of type i collagen and osteocalcin mrna, as determined by real-time pcr, and reduced alp activity and mineralization, as determined by von kossa and alizarin red stainings. in contrast, amp kinase activation by aicar  in wild-type mc3t3-e <dig> cells augmented their proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization. brdu assay showed that the addition of adiponectin  also promoted their proliferation. osterix, but not runx- <dig>  appeared to be involved in these processes because adipor <dig> sirna transfection and aicar treatments suppressed and enhanced osterix mrna expression, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, this study suggests that adiponectin stimulates the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of osteoblasts via the adipor <dig> and amp kinase signaling pathways in autocrine and/or paracrine fashions.
