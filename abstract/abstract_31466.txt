BACKGROUND
as nuclear mediators of wnt/β-catenin signaling, lef/tcf transcription factors play important roles in development and disease. although it is well established, that the four vertebrate lef/tcfs have unique functional properties, most studies unite lef- <dig>  tcf- <dig>  tcf- <dig> and tcf- <dig> and reduce their function to uniformly transduce wnt/β-catenin signaling for activating wnt target genes. in order to discriminate target genes regulated by xtcf- <dig> from those regulated by xtcf- <dig> or lef/tcfs in general, we performed a subtractive screen, using neuralized xenopus animal cap explants.


RESULTS
we identified cold-inducible rna binding protein  as novel xtcf- <dig> specific target gene. furthermore, we show that knockdown of xtcf- <dig> by injection of an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide results in a general broadening of the anterior neural tissue. depletion of xcirp by antisense morpholino oligonucleotide injection leads to a reduced stability of mrna and an enlargement of the anterior neural plate similar to the depletion of xtcf- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
distinct steps in neural development are differentially regulated by individual lef/tcfs. for proper development of the anterior brain xtcf- <dig> and the tcf-subtype specific target xcirp appear indispensable. thus, regulation of anterior neural development, at least in part, depends on mrna stabilization by the novel xtcf- <dig> target gene xcirp.
