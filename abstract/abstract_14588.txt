BACKGROUND
bone morphogenic proteins  promote the survival of neurons, suggesting a therapeutic application of bmps in the treatment of acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. however, the application of recombinant bmps in vivo is limited by their short half-life. to provide a continuous supply for functionally active bmps, we expressed bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and the bmp inhibitor noggin under the control of raav vectors in vivo. for visual control of raav-mediated bmp  expression we fused the secreted morphogenic polypeptides and the fluorescent reporter protein venus via the ‘ribosomal skip’ promoting 2a peptide-bridge.


RESULTS
in primary cortical neurons, the raav-expressed morphogenic polypeptides were efficiently released from the 2a-venus fusion precursors, were secreted, correctly processed and functionally active as shown by their effects on smad phosphorylation in hela cells and in primary neurons, by the protection of v-bmp7-transduced primary cortical neurons against oxidative stress, and by the activation of bmp responsive gfp in v-bmp <dig> transduced reporter mice. in the stroke model of middle cerebral artery occlusion raav-transduced v-bmp <dig> reduced the infarct size in mice.


CONCLUSIONS
polycistronic raav vectors encoding secreted polypeptides and 2a-linked reporter proteins are potential novel therapeutic tools for the treatment of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. using this technique we documented that raav delivery of bmp <dig> reduced ischemic cell death in mice.
