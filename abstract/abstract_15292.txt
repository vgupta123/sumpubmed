BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  has now been widely recognized as an economically important disease. the objective of this study was to compare the molecular and biological characteristics of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  field isolates in china to those of the modified live virus  prrs vaccine and its parent strain .


RESULTS
five genes  of seven isolates of prrsv from china, designated ls- <dig>  hm- <dig>  hq- <dig>  hq- <dig>  gc- <dig>  gch- <dig> and st-7/ <dig>  were sequenced and analyzed. phylogenetic analyses based on the nucleotide sequence of the orf2- <dig> and nsp <dig> showed that the seven chinese isolates belonged to the same genetic subgroup and were related to the north american prrsv genotype. comparative analysis with the relevant sequences of another chinese isolate  and north american  viruses revealed that these isolates have  <dig> - <dig> % homology with vr- <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig> % identity with mlv and  <dig> - <dig> % with bj- <dig>  all nsp <dig> nonstructural protein of these seven isolates exhibited variations  in comparison with other north american prrsv isolates. therefore, these isolates were novel strain with unique amino acid composition. however, they all share more than 97% identity with other highly pathogenic chinese prrsv strains. additionally, there are extensive amino acid  mutations in the gp <dig> protein and the nsp <dig> protein when compared with the previous isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
these results might be useful to study the genetic diversity of prrsv in china and to track the infection sources as well as for vaccines development.
