BACKGROUND
dipeptidyl peptidase iv, a multifunctional serine protease, is implicated in regulation of malignant transformation, promotion and further progression of cancer, exerting tumor-suppressing or even completely opposite - tumor-promoting activities.

the aim of present research was to determine the serum dppiv activity, as well as the percentages of cd26+ lymphocytes, cd26+ overall white blood cells and the mean fluorescence intensity of cd <dig> expression on lymphocytes in patients with melanoma, people with vitiligo and in healthy controls.

methods
the activity of dppiv in serum was determined by colorimetric test. expression of dppiv  on immunocompetent peripheral white blood cells was done using flow cytometry analysis.


RESULTS
data from our study show for the first time statistically significant decrease: in the serum dppiv activity, in the percentage of cd26+ overall white blood cells and in the percentage of lymphocytes in patients with melanoma in comparison to healthy control people. in addition, significantly lower serum dppiv activity was found in the group of patients with melanoma in relation to people with vitiligo too.


CONCLUSIONS
this study indicates the need for exploring the cause and the importance of the disturbances in the serum dppiv activity and in the cd <dig> expression on immunocompetent cells in complex molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of melanoma.
