BACKGROUND
vertebrate odorant receptors comprise at least three types of g protein-coupled receptors : the or, v1r, and v2r/v2r-like receptors, the latter group belonging to the c family of gpcrs. these receptor families are thought to receive chemosensory information from a wide spectrum of odorant and pheromonal cues that influence critical animal behaviors such as feeding, reproduction and other social interactions.


RESULTS
using genome database mining and other informatics approaches, we identified and characterized the repertoire of  <dig> intact "v2r-like" olfactory c family gpcrs in the zebrafish. phylogenetic analysis – which also included a set of  <dig> c family gpcrs from fugu – places the fish olfactory receptors in three major groups, which are related to but clearly distinct from other c family gpcrs, including the calcium sensing receptor, metabotropic glutamate receptors, gaba-b receptor, t1r taste receptors, and the major group of v2r vomeronasal receptor families. interestingly, an analysis of sequence conservation and selective pressure in the zebrafish receptors revealed the retention of a conserved sequence motif previously shown to be required for ligand binding in other amino acid receptors.


CONCLUSIONS
based on our findings, we propose that the repertoire of zebrafish olfactory c family gpcrs has evolved to allow the detection and discrimination of a spectrum of amino acid and/or amino acid-based compounds, which are potent olfactory cues in fish. furthermore, as the major groups of fish receptors and mammalian v2r receptors appear to have diverged significantly from a common ancestral gene, these receptors likely mediate chemosensation of different classes of chemical structures by their respective organisms.
