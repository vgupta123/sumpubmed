BACKGROUND
the four highly homologous human ehd proteins  form a distinct subfamily of the eps <dig> homology domain-containing protein family and are thought to regulate endocytic recycling. certain members of this family have been studied in different cellular contexts; however, a lack of concurrent analyses of all four proteins has impeded an appreciation of their redundant versus distinct functions.


RESULTS
here, we analyzed the four ehd proteins both in mammalian cells and in a cross-species complementation assay using a c. elegans mutant lacking the ehd ortholog rme- <dig>  we show that all human ehd proteins rescue the vacuolated intestinal phenotype of c. elegans rme- <dig> mutant, are simultaneously expressed in a panel of mammalian cell lines and tissues tested, and variably homo- and hetero-oligomerize and colocalize with each other and rab <dig>  a recycling endosome marker. small interfering rna  knock-down of ehd <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and expression of dominant-negative eh domain deletion mutants showed that loss of ehd <dig> and  <dig>  but not ehd <dig> function retarded transferrin exit from the endocytic recycling compartment. eh domain deletion mutants of ehd <dig> and  <dig> but not  <dig> or  <dig>  induced a striking perinuclear clustering of co-transfected rab <dig>  knock-down analyses indicated that ehd <dig> and  <dig> regulate the exit of cargo from the recycling endosome while ehd <dig>  similar to that reported for ehd <dig>  mol. biol. cell  <dig>  163), regulates transport from the early endosome to the recycling endosome.


CONCLUSIONS
altogether, our studies suggest that concurrently expressed human ehd proteins perform shared as well as discrete functions in the endocytic recycling pathway and lay a foundation for future studies to identify and characterize the molecular pathways involved.
