BACKGROUND
bacterial disulfide bond forming  proteins facilitate proper folding and disulfide bond formation of periplasmic and secreted proteins. previously, we have shown that mycobacterium tuberculosis mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf aid in vitro oxidative folding of proteins. the m. tuberculosis proteome contains another predicted membrane-tethered dsb protein, mt-dsba, which is encoded by an essential gene.


RESULTS
herein, we present structural and biochemical analyses of mt-dsba. the x-ray crystal structure of mt-dsba reveals a two-domain structure, comprising a canonical thioredoxin domain with the conserved cxxc active site cysteines in their reduced form, and an inserted Î±-helical domain containing a structural disulfide bond. the overall fold of mt-dsba resembles that of other dsba-like proteins and not mt-dsbe or mt-dsbf. biochemical characterization demonstrates that, unlike mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf, mt-dsba is unable to oxidatively fold reduced, denatured hirudin. moreover, on the substrates tested in this study, mt-dsba has disulfide bond isomerase activity contrary to mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that mt-dsba acts upon a distinct subset of substrates as compared to mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf. one could speculate that mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf are functionally redundant whereas mt-dsba is not, offering an explanation for the essentiality of mt-dsba in m. tuberculosis.
