BACKGROUND
protein sequence profile-profile alignment is an important approach to recognizing remote homologs and generating accurate pairwise alignments. it plays an important role in protein sequence database search, protein structure prediction, protein function prediction, and phylogenetic analysis.


RESULTS
in this work, we integrate predicted solvent accessibility, torsion angles and evolutionary residue coupling information with the pairwise hidden markov model  based profile alignment method to improve profile-profile alignments. the evaluation results demonstrate that adding predicted relative solvent accessibility and torsion angle information improves the accuracy of profile-profile alignments. the evolutionary residue coupling information is helpful in some cases, but its contribution to the improvement is not consistent.


CONCLUSIONS
incorporating the new structural information such as predicted solvent accessibility and torsion angles into the profile-profile alignment is a useful way to improve pairwise profile-profile alignment methods.
