BACKGROUND
lafora disease  is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder produced mainly by mutations in two genes: epm2a, encoding the dual specificity phosphatase laforin, and epm2b, encoding the e3-ubiquitin ligase malin. although it is known that laforin and malin may form a functional complex, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this pathology are still far from being understood.

methods
in order to gain information about the substrates of the laforin/malin complex, we have carried out a yeast substrate-trapping screening, originally designed to identify substrates of protein tyrosine phosphatases.


RESULTS
our results identify the two muscular isoforms of pyruvate kinase  as novel interaction partners of laforin.


CONCLUSIONS
we present evidence indicating that the laforin/malin complex is able to interact with and ubiquitinate both pkm <dig> and pkm <dig>  this post-translational modification, although it does not affect the catalytic activity of pkm <dig>  it impairs the nuclear localization of pkm <dig>
