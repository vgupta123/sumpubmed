BACKGROUND
a study to investigate transmission of classical scrapie via goat milk was carried out in sheep: firstly, lambs were challenged orally with goat scrapie brain homogenate to confirm transmission of scrapie from goats to sheep. in the second study phase, milk from scrapie-infected goats was fed to lambs. lambs were selected according to their prion protein gene  genotype, which was either vrq/vrq or arq/arq, with or without additional polymorphisms at codon  <dig>  of the ovine prnp. this report describes the clinical, pathological and molecular phenotype of goat scrapie in those sheep that progressed to clinical end-stage.


RESULTS
ten sheep  challenged with one of two scrapie brain homogenates, and six pairs of sheep  fed milk from six different goats, developed clinical disease, which was characterised by a pruritic  or a non-pruritic form . immunohistochemical  examination revealed that the pattern of intra- and extracellular accumulation of disease-associated prion protein in the brain was also dependent on prnp polymorphisms at codon  <dig>  which was similar in vrq and ll <dig> sheep but different from lf <dig> and ff <dig> sheep. the influence of codon  <dig> was also seen in discriminatory western blot , with lf <dig> and ff <dig> sheep showing a bovine spongiform encephalopathy-like profile  on brain tissue. however, discriminatory wb in lymphoid tissues, and ihc pattern and profile both in lymphoid and brain tissue was consistent with classical scrapie in all sheep.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provided further evidence that the clinical presentation and the pathological and molecular phenotypes of scrapie in sheep are influenced by prnp polymorphisms, particularly at codon  <dig>  differences in the truncation of disease-associated prion protein between ll <dig> sheep and those carrying the f <dig> allele may be responsible for these observations.
