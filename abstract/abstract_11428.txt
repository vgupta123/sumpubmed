BACKGROUND
mucosal epithelia, including those of the oviduct, secrete antimicrobial innate immune molecules . these have bactericidal/bacteriostatic functions against a variety of pathogens. among the aiims, sheep β-defensin- <dig>  is one of the most potent. even though the sbd- <dig> is an important aiim and it is regulated closely by estrogenic hormone, the regulation mechanism of 17β-estradiol has not been clearly established. we investigated the effects of e <dig> and agonist or inhibitor on ovine oviduct epithelial cells in regard to sbd- <dig> expression using reverse transcription quantitative pcr . in addition, three different pathways were inhibited separately or simultaneously to confirm the effect of different inhibitors in the regulation mechanism.


RESULTS
17beta-estradiol  induced release of sbd- <dig> in ovine oviduct epithelial cells. sbd- <dig> expression was mediated through g-protein-coupled receptor  <dig>  and estrogen receptors  activation in ovine oviduct epithelial cell. inhibition of gene expression of protein kinase a , protein kinase c , and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells  led to a decreased sbd- <dig> expression.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, e2-induced up-regulation of sbd- <dig> expressions were gpr30-dependent during prophase and ers-dependent during later-stage in ovine oviduct epithelial cells, and we assume that the effect was completed by the pka, pkc, and nf-κb pathways simultaneous.
