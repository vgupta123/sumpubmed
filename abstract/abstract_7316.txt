BACKGROUND
bacillus thuringiensis cry1aa insecticidal protein is the most active known b. thuringiensis toxin against the forest insect pest lymantria dispar , unfortunately it is also highly toxic against the non-target insect bombyx mori .


RESULTS
surface exposed hydrophobic residues over domains ii and iii were targeted for site-directed mutagenesis. substitution of a phenylalanine residue  by alanine reduced binding to the bombyx mori cadherin by 23-fold, reduced biological activity against b. mori by 4-fold, while retaining activity against lymantria dispar.


CONCLUSIONS
the results identify a novel receptor-binding epitope and demonstrate that virtual elimination of binding to cadherin br- <dig> does not completely remove toxicity in the case of b. mori.
