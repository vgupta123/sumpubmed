BACKGROUND
alveoli, the milk-producing units of the mammary gland, are generated during pregnancy by collaboration of different epithelial cell types. we present the first analysis of transcriptional changes within the hormone sensing population during pregnancy. hormone-receptor positive  cells play a key role in the initiation of alveologenesis as they sense systemic hormonal changes and translate these into local instructions for neighboring hr- cells. we recently showed that igf <dig> is produced specifically by hr+ cells in early pregnancy, but is undetectable in the virgin state. here, we define the transcriptome of hr+ cells in early pregnancy with the aim to elucidate additional changes that are unique for this dynamic developmental time window.


RESULTS
we harvested mammary glands from virgin, 3-day and 7-day pregnant mice and isolated a few hundred hormone-sensing cells per animal by facs for microarray analysis. there was a high concordance between animals with a clear induction of cell cycle progression genes at day  <dig> of pregnancy and molecules involved in paracrine signalling at day  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these findings underscore the proliferative capacity of hr+ cells upon specific stimuli and elucidate developmentally-restricted changes in cellular communication. since the majority of breast cancers are hr+, with a variable proportion of hr+ cells per tumor, we anticipate that this data set will aid further studies into the regulation of hr+ cell proliferation and the role of heterotypic signalling within tumors.
