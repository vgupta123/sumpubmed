BACKGROUND
individuals with 22q <dig>  deletion syndrome  are a specific high-risk group for developing schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder  and autism spectrum disorders . several genes in the deleted region have been implicated in the development of sz, e.g., prodh and dgcr <dig>  however, the mechanistic connection between these genes and the neuropsychiatric phenotype remains unclear. to elucidate the molecular consequences of 22q <dig>  deletion in early neural development, we carried out rna-seq analysis to investigate gene expression in early differentiating human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells  of 22q <dig>  ds sz and sad patients.

methods
eight cases  and seven controls  were subjected to rna sequencing. using a systems level analysis, differentially expressed genes/gene-modules and pathway of interests were identified. lastly, we related our findings from in vitro neuronal cultures to brain development by mapping differentially expressed genes to brainspan transcriptomes.


RESULTS
we observed ~2-fold reduction in expression of almost all genes in the 22q <dig>  region in sz . outside of the deleted region,  <dig> genes showed significant differences in expression between sz and control neurons . function enrichment and network analysis of the differentially expressed genes uncovered converging evidence on abnormal expression in key functional pathways, such as apoptosis, cell cycle and survival, and mapk signaling in the sz and sad samples. by leveraging transcriptome profiles of normal human brain tissues across human development into adulthood, we showed that the differentially expressed genes converge on a sub-network mediated by cdc <dig> and the cell cycle, which would be disrupted by the 22q <dig>  deletion during embryonic brain development, and another sub-network modulated by prodh, which could contribute to disruption of brain function during adolescence.


CONCLUSIONS
this study has provided evidence for disruption of potential molecular events in sz patient with 22q <dig>  deletion and related our findings from in vitro neuronal cultures to functional perturbations that can occur during brain development in sz.
