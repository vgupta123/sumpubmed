BACKGROUND
it is estimated that floral deception has evolved in at least  <dig> species of angiosperms, of which two thirds are orchids. epipactis veratrifolia  is a model system of aphid mimicry as aphidophagous hoverflies lay eggs on false brood sites on their flowers. to understand the evolutionary ecology of floral deception, we investigated the pollination biology of e. veratrifolia across  <dig> populations in the eastern himalayas. we reconstructed the phylogeny of epipactis and mapped the known pollination systems of previously studied species onto the tree.


RESULTS
some inflorescences of e. veratrifolia were so infested with aphids while they were still in bud that the some larvae of hoverflies developed to the third instar while flower buds opened. this indicated that adult female hoverflies were partly rewarded for oviposition. although flowers failed to secrete nectar, they mimicked both alarm pheromones and aphid coloring of to attract female hoverflies as their exclusive pollinators. phylogenetic mapping indicate that pollination by aphidophagous hoverflies is likely an ancestral condition in the genus epipactis. we suggest that the biological interaction of aphid , orchid  and hoverfly  may represent an intermediate stage between mutualism and deception in the evolution of pollination-by-deceit in e. veratrifolia.


CONCLUSIONS
our analyses indicate that this intermediate stage may be used as a model system to interpret the origin of oviposition  mimicry in epipactis. we propose the hypothesis that some deceptive pollination systems evolved directly from earlier  mutualistic systems that maintained the fidelity of the original pollinator even though rewards  were lost.
