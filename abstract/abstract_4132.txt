BACKGROUND
the mesencephalic dopaminergic  cell system is composed of two major groups of projecting cells in the substantia nigra   and the ventral tegmental area  . selective degeneration of a <dig> neurons occurs in parkinson’s disease  while abnormal function of a <dig> cells has been linked to schizophrenia, attention deficit and addiction. the molecular basis that underlies selective vulnerability of a <dig> and a <dig> neurons is presently unknown.


RESULTS
by taking advantage of transgenic labeling, laser capture microdissection coupled to nano cap-analysis of gene expression  technology on isolated a <dig> and a <dig> cells, we found that a subset of olfactory receptors s is expressed in mda neurons. gene expression analysis was integrated with the fantom <dig> helicos cage sequencing datasets, showing the presence of these ors in selected tissues and brain areas outside of the olfactory epithelium. or expression in the mesencephalon was validated by rt-pcr and in situ hybridization. by screening  <dig> potential ligands on  <dig> mda ors recombinantly expressed in an heterologous in vitro system, we identified carvone enantiomers as agonists at olfr <dig> and able to evoke an intracellular ca2+ increase in solitary mda neurons. ors were found expressed in human sn and down-regulated in pd post mortem brains.


CONCLUSIONS
our study indicates that mda neurons express ors and respond to odor-like molecules providing new opportunities for pharmacological intervention in disease.
