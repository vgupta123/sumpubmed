BACKGROUND
data regarding the quantitative expression of tcr vβ subpopulations in children with autoimmune diseases provided interesting and sometimes conflicting results. the aim of the present study was to assess by comparative flow cytometric analysis the peripheral blood cd4+ tcr vβ repertoire of children with an organ-specific autoimmune disorder, such as type  <dig> diabetes mellitus , in comparison to children with a systemic autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus  in comparison to healthy age-matched controls of the same ethnic origin. the cd4+ tcr vβ repertoire was analysed by flow cytometry in three groups of participants: a) fifteen newly diagnosed children with t1dm , b) nine newly diagnosed children with sle, positive for ana and anti-dsdna, prior to treatment  and c)  <dig> healthy age-matched controls , all of hellenic origin.


RESULTS
cd4 + tcr vβ abnormalities  were observed mainly in sle patients. statistical analysis revealed that the cd4 + vβ <dig> chain was significantly increased in patients with t1dm , whereas cd4 + vβ <dig> one was significantly increased in sle patients  compared to controls.


CONCLUSIONS
cd4 + vβ <dig> and cd4 + vβ <dig> chains could be possibly involved in the cascade of events precipitating the pathogenesis of t1dm and sle in children, respectively.
