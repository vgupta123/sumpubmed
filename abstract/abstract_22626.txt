BACKGROUND
preparation of rna free from dna is a critical step before performing rt-pcr assay. total rna isolated from several sources, including those obtained from saccharomyces cerevisiae, using routine methodologies are frequently contaminated with dna, which can give rise to amplification products that mimic the amplicons expected from the rna target.


RESULTS
we investigated the efficiency of two dnase i based protocols for eliminating dna contaminations from rna samples obtained from yeast cells. both procedures are very efficient in eliminating dna contamination from rna samples and entail three main steps, which involve treating of rna samples with dnase i, inhibition of the enzyme by edta and its subsequent inactivation at 65Â°c. the dnase i treated samples were further purified with phenol: chloroform followed by precipitation with ice-cold ethanol  or, alternatively, they were directly used in rt-pcr reactions . transcripts from act <dig>  pda <dig>  cna <dig>  cna <dig>  tps <dig> and tps <dig> analyzed after each treatment showed that all mrnas tested can be amplified if total rna was extracted and purified after dnase i treatment, however, only tps <dig>  tps <dig> and act <dig> mrnas were amplified without extraction/purification step.


CONCLUSIONS
although more laborious and requiring a higher initial amount of material, the inclusion of an extraction and purification step allows to prepare rna samples that are free from dna and from low molecular contaminants and can be applied to amplify any saccharomyces cerevisiae mrna by rt-pcr.
