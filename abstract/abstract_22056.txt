BACKGROUND
frontotemporal lobar degeneration  is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that can be triggered through genetic or sporadic mechanisms. micrornas  have become a major therapeutic focus as their pervasive expression and powerful regulatory roles in disease pathogenesis become increasingly apparent. here we examine the role of mirnas in ftld patients with tar dna-binding protein  <dig> pathology  caused by genetic mutations in the progranulin  gene.


RESULTS
using mirna array profiling, we identified the  <dig> mirnas that showed greatest evidence  of dysregulation in frontal cortex of eight ftld-tdp patients carrying pgrn mutations when compared to  <dig> ftld-tdp patients with no apparent genetic abnormalities. quantitative real-time pcr  analyses provided technical validation of the differential expression for  <dig> of the  <dig> mirnas in frontal cortex. additional qrt-pcr analyses showed that  <dig> out of  <dig> mirnas  were also significantly dysregulated  in cerebellar tissue samples of pgrn mutation carriers, consistent with a systemic reduction in pgrn levels. we developed a list of gene targets for the  <dig> candidate mirnas and found  <dig> genes dysregulated in a reported ftld mrna study to exhibit anti-correlated mirna-mrna patterns in affected cortex and cerebellar tissue. among the targets is brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor  <dig>  which was recently identified as an important player in synapse biology.


CONCLUSIONS
our study suggests that mirnas may contribute to the pathogenesis of ftld-tdp caused by pgrn mutations and provides new insight into potential future therapeutic options.
