BACKGROUND
human platelets are a rich reservoir of molecules that promote regenerative processes and microbicidal activity. this activity might be increased by concentration in platelet-rich plasma  products and modulated by the presence of leukocytes. despite extensive use in clinical procedures, only few studies have investigated prp’s real microbicidal potential. therefore, this study aimed at comparing the in vitro microbicidal activity of platelets and leukocyte-enriched prp  to pure platelet-rich plasma  and the contribution of leukocytes to microbicidal properties.

antimicrobial effects of p- and l-prp were tested against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. furthermore, l-prp was frozen  to assess whether the preparation maintained in vitro characteristics. microbicidal proteins released by the three preparations were also evaluated.


RESULTS
l-prp, l-prp cryo and p-prp generally induced comparable bacterial growth inhibition for up to 4 h’ incubation, range 1– <dig> log. mip-1α, rantes, gro-α, il- <dig>  nap- <dig>  sdf-1α and il- <dig> showed strong microbicidal potential.


CONCLUSIONS
we found in vitro antibacterial activity of l-prp and p-prp and the possibility to cryopreserve l-prp, without important changes to its effectiveness; similar microbicidal activity between preparations containing or not leukocytes; and the contribution of three new molecules .
