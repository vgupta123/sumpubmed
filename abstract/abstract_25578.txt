BACKGROUND
berberine , the major alkaloidal component of rhizoma coptidis, has multiple pharmacological effects including inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, reduction of cholesterol and glucose levels, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects. it has also been demonstrated that ber can reduce the production of beta-amyloid40/ <dig>  which plays a critical and primary role in the pathogenesis of alzheimer's disease. however, the mechanism by which it accomplishes this remains unclear.


RESULTS
here, we report that ber could not only significantly decrease the production of beta-amyloid40/ <dig> and the expression of beta-secretase , but was also able to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/ <dig>  pathway in a dose- and time-dependent manner in hek <dig> cells stably transfected with app <dig> containing the swedish mutation. we also find that u <dig>  an antagonist of the erk1/ <dig> pathway, could abolish  the activation activity of ber on the erk1/ <dig> pathway and  the inhibition activity of ber on the production of beta-amyloid40/ <dig> and the expression of bace.


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that ber decreases the production of beta-amyloid40/ <dig> by inhibiting the expression of bace via activation of the erk1/ <dig> pathway.
