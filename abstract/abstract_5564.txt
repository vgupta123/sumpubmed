BACKGROUND
we recently showed that whereas inhibition of pi3k/akt or jak/stat pathway promoted retinal ganglion cell  survival after optic nerve  injury in fischer  <dig>  rats, the same inhibition resulted in aggravated rgc loss after acute intraocular pressure  elevation in sprague dawley  rats. in addition, the responses of macrophages to on injury and acute iop elevation were different between f <dig> and lewis rats, i.e., different autoimmune profiles. using an acute iop elevation paradigm in this study, we investigated 1) whether autoimmune background influences pi3k/akt and jak/stat functions by examining the effect of pi3k/akt and jak/stat pathway inhibition on rgc survival in f <dig> and lewis rats, and 2) whether differential actions of macrophages occur in pi3k/akt and jak/stat pathways-dependent modulation of rgc survival. iop elevation was performed at  <dig> mmhg for  <dig> hours. pi3k/akt and jak/stat pathway inhibitors were applied intravitreally to block their respective pathway signaling transduction. because macrophage invasion was seen in the eye after the pathway inhibition, to examine the role of these pathways independent of macrophages, macrophages in the retina were removed by intravitreal application of clodronate liposomes. viable rgcs were retrogradely labelled by fluorogold  <dig> hours before animal sacrifice.


RESULTS
similar to what was previously observed, significantly more rgcs were lost in lewis than f <dig> rats  <dig> weeks after acute iop elevation. as in spd rats, inhibition of the pi3k/akt or jak/stat pathway increased the loss of rgcs in both f <dig> and lewis rats. removal of macrophages in the eye by clodronate liposomes reduced rgc loss due to pathway inhibition in both strains.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that following acute iop elevation 1) pi3k/akt and jak/stat pathways mediate rgc survival in both f <dig> and lewis rats, 2) autoimmune responses do not influence the functions of these two pathways, and 3) pi3k/akt and jak/stat pathway inhibition-dependent activation of macrophages is detrimental to rgcs.
