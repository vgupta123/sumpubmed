BACKGROUND
phages could be an important alternative to antibiotics, especially for treatment of multiresistant bacteria as e.g. pseudomonas aeruginosa. for an effective use of bacteriophages as antimicrobial agents, it is important to understand phage biology but also genes of the bacterial host essential for phage infection.


RESULTS
we isolated and characterized a lytic pseudomonas aeruginosa phage, named jg <dig>  and sequenced its genome. phage jg <dig> is a lipopolysaccharide specific broad-host-range phage of the myoviridae phage family. the genome of phage jg <dig> encodes twelve trnas and is highly related to the pak-p <dig> phage genome. to investigate phage biology and phage-host interactions, we used transposon mutagenesis of the p. aeruginosa host and identified p. aeruginosa genes, which are essential for phage infection. analysis of the respective p. aeruginosa mutants revealed several characteristics, such as host receptor and possible spermidine-dependance of phage jg <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
whole genome sequencing of phage jg <dig> in combination with identification of p. aeruginosa host genes essential for infection, allowed insights into jg <dig> biology, revealed possible resistance mechanisms of the host bacterium such as mutations in lps and spermidine biosynthesis and can also be used to characterize unknown gene products in p. aeruginosa.
