BACKGROUND
the entomopathogenic anamorphic fungus metarhizum anisopliae is currently used as a biocontrol agent  of insects. in the present work, we analyzed the sequence data obtained from group i introns in the large subunit  of rdna genes with a view to determining the genetic diversity present in an autochthonous collection of twenty-six m. anisopliae isolates selected as bcas.


RESULTS
dna fragments corresponding to the 3'-end of the nuclear lsu rdna genes of  <dig> m. anisopliae isolates were amplified by pcr. the amplicon sizes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> -kb. four intron insertion sites, according to escherichia coli j <dig> numbering, were detected- ec <dig>  ec <dig>  ec <dig> and ec2563- after sequencing and analysis of the pcr products. the presence/absence of introns allowed the  <dig> isolates to be distributed into seven genotypes. nine of the isolates tested showed no introns,  <dig> had only one,  <dig> two, and  <dig> displayed three introns. the most frequent insertion sites were ec <dig> and ec <dig>  of the  <dig> isolates,  <dig> showed insertions at ec <dig> and a 1754-bp sequence was observed in ten of them. the most-parsimonious  tree obtained from parsimony analysis of the introns revealed a main set containing four-groups that corresponded to the four insertion sites.


CONCLUSIONS
four insertion sites of group i introns in the lsu rdna genes allowed the establishment of seven genotypes among the twenty-six biocontrol isolates of m. anisopliae. intron insertions at the ec <dig> site were observed for first time in this species.
