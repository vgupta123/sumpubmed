BACKGROUND
due to excessive antibiotic use, drug-resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis has become a serious public health threat and a major obstacle to disease control in many countries. to better understand the evolution of drug-resistant m. tuberculosis strains, we performed whole genome sequencing for 7 m. tuberculosis clinical isolates with different antibiotic resistance profiles and conducted comparative genomic analysis of gene variations among them.


RESULTS
we observed that all 7 m. tuberculosis clinical isolates with different levels of drug resistance harbored similar numbers of snps, ranging from 1409– <dig>  the numbers of insertion/deletions  identified in the  <dig> isolates were also similar, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  a total of  <dig> types of mutations were identified in drug resistance-associated loci, including  <dig> previously reported ones and  <dig> newly identified ones. sixteen of the identified large indels spanned pe-ppe-pgrs genes, which represents a major source of antigenic variability. aside from snps and indels, a crispr locus with varied spacers was observed in all  <dig> clinical isolates, suggesting that they might play an important role in plasticity of the m. tuberculosis genome. the nucleotide diversity  and selection intensity  of the whole genome sequences of the  <dig> isolates were similar. the dn/ds values were less than  <dig> for all  <dig> isolates , supporting the notion that m. tuberculosis genomes undergo purifying selection. the Л values and dn/ds values were comparable between drug-susceptible and drug-resistant strains.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we show that clinical m. tuberculosis isolates exhibit distinct variations in terms of the distribution of snp, indels, crispr-cas locus, as well as the nucleotide diversity and selection intensity, but there are no generalizable differences between drug-susceptible and drug-resistant isolates on the genomic scale. our study provides evidence strengthening the notion that the evolution of drug resistance among clinical m. tuberculosis isolates is clearly a complex and diversified process.
