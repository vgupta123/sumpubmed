BACKGROUND
a computationally efficient tool is required for a genome-wide gene-gene interaction analysis that tests an extremely large number of single-nucleotide polymorphism  interaction pairs in genome-wide association studies . current tools for gwas interaction analysis are mainly developed for unrelated case-control samples. relatively fewer tools for interaction analysis are available for complex disease studies with family-based design, and these tools tend to be computationally expensive.


RESULTS
we developed a fast gene-gene interaction test, gcore-sib, for discordant sib pairs and implemented the test into an efficient tool. we used simulations to demonstrate that the gcore-sib has correct type i error rates and has comparable power to that of the regression-based interaction test. we also showed that the gcore-sib can run more than  <dig> times faster than the regression-based test. finally, the gcore-sib was applied to a gwas dataset with approximately  <dig>  discordant sib pairs, and the gcore-sib finished testing  <dig> , <dig>  pairs of snps within 6 days.


CONCLUSIONS
an efficient gene-gene interaction tool for discordant sib pairs was developed. it will be very useful for genome-wide gene-gene interaction analysis in gwas using discordant sib pairs. the tool can be downloaded for free at http://gcore-sib.sourceforge.net.
