BACKGROUND
rapid evolutions in sequencing technology force read mappers into flexible adaptation to longer reads, changing error models, memory barriers and novel applications.


RESULTS
alfalfa achieves a high performance in accurately mapping long single-end and paired-end reads to gigabase-scale reference genomes, while remaining competitive for mapping shorter reads. its seed-and-extend workflow is underpinned by fast retrieval of super-maximal exact matches from an enhanced sparse suffix array, with flexible parameter tuning to balance performance, memory footprint and accuracy.


CONCLUSIONS
alfalfa is open source and available at http://alfalfa.ugent.be.
