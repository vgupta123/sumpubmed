BACKGROUND
the cotton boll weevil  is a serious insect-pest in the americas, particularly in brazil. the use of chemical or biological insect control is not effective against the cotton boll weevil because of its endophytic life style. therefore, the use of biotechnological tools to produce insect-resistant transgenic plants represents an important strategy to reduce the damage to cotton plants caused by the boll weevil. the present study focuses on the identification of novel molecules that show improved toxicity against the cotton boll weevil. in vitro directed molecular evolution through dna shuffling and phage display screening was applied to enhance the insecticidal activity of variants of the cry8ka <dig> protein of bacillus thuringiensis.


RESULTS
bioassays carried out with a. grandis larvae revealed that the lc <dig> of the screened mutant cry8ka <dig> toxin was  <dig> -fold higher than the wild-type cry8ka <dig> toxin. homology modelling of cry8ka <dig> and the cry8ka <dig> mutant suggested that both proteins retained the typical three-domain cry family structure. the mutated residues were located mostly in loops and appeared unlikely to interfere with molecular stability.


CONCLUSIONS
the improved toxicity of the cry8ka <dig> mutant obtained in this study will allow the generation of a transgenic cotton event with improved potential to control a. grandis.
