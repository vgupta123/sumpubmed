BACKGROUND
bcl- <dig> homology domain  3-only proteins are pro-apoptotic proteins of the bcl- <dig> family that couple stress signals to the mitochondrial cell death pathways. the bh3-only protein bid can be activated in response to death receptor activation via caspase 8-mediated cleavage into a truncated protein , which subsequently translocates to mitochondria and induces the release of cytochrome-c. using a single-cell imaging approach of bid cleavage and translocation during apoptosis, we have recently demonstrated that, in contrast to death receptor-induced apoptosis, caspase-independent excitotoxic apoptosis involves a translocation of full length bid  from the cytosol to mitochondria. we induced a delayed excitotoxic cell death in cultured rat hippocampal neurons by a 5-min exposure to the glutamate receptor agonist n-methyl-d-aspartate .


RESULTS
western blot experiments confirmed a translocation of fl-bid to the mitochondria during excitotoxic apoptosis that was associated with the release of cytochrome-c from mitochondria. these results were confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis of bid translocation during excitotoxic cell death using an antibody raised against the amino acids 1â€“ <dig> of mouse bid that is not able to detect tbid. finally, inducible overexpression of fl-bid or a bid mutant that can not be cleaved by caspase- <dig> was sufficient to induce apoptosis in the hippocampal neuron cultures.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that translocation of fl-bid is sufficient for the activation of mitochondrial cell death pathways in response to glutamate receptor overactivation.
