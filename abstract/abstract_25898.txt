BACKGROUND
the ultrasonic vocalizations  of courting male mice are known to possess a phonetic structure with a complex combination of several syllables. the genetic mechanisms underlying the syllable sequence organization were investigated.


RESULTS
this study compared syllable sequence organization in two inbred strains of mice, 129s4/svjae  and c57bl6j , and demonstrated that they possessed two mutually exclusive phenotypes. the 129s4/svjae  strain frequently exhibited a "chevron-wave" usv pattern, which was characterized by the repetition of chevron-type syllables. the c57bl/6j strain produced a "staccato" usv pattern, which was characterized by the repetition of short-type syllables. an f <dig> strain obtained by crossing the 129s4/svjae and c57bl/6j strains produced only the staccato phenotype. the chevron-wave and staccato phenotypes reappeared in the f <dig> generations, following the mendelian law of independent assortment.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that two genetic loci control the organization of syllable sequences. these loci were occupied by the staccato and chevron-wave alleles in the b <dig> and  <dig> mouse strains, respectively. recombination of these alleles might lead to the diversity of usv patterns produced by mice.
