BACKGROUND
lupulin glands of hop produce a specific metabolome including hop bitter acids valuable for the brewing process and prenylflavonoids with promising health-beneficial activities. the detailed analysis of the transcription factor -mediated regulation of the oligofamily of one of the key enzymes, i.e., chalcone synthase chs_h <dig> that efficiently catalyzes the production of naringenin chalcone, a direct precursor of prenylflavonoids in hop, constitutes an important part of the dissection of the biosynthetic pathways leading to the accumulation of these compounds.


RESULTS
homologues of flavonoid-regulating tfs hlmyb <dig> , hlbhlh <dig>  and hlwdr <dig>  from hop were cloned using a lupulin gland-specific cdna library from the hop variety osvald's  <dig>  using a "combinatorial" transient gus expression system it was shown that these unique lupulin-gland-associated tfs significantly activated the promoter  of chs_h <dig> in ternary combinations of b <dig>  w <dig> and either m <dig> or the previously characterized hlmyb <dig> . the promoter activation was strongly dependent on the myb-p binding box tcctacc having a core sequence ccwacc positioned on its 5' end region and it seems that the complexity of the promoter plays an important role. m2b2w1-mediated activation significantly exceeded the strength of expression of native chs_h <dig> gene driven by the 35s promoter of camv, while m3b2w <dig> resulted in 30% of the 35s:chs_h <dig> expression level, as quantified by real-time pcr. another newly cloned hop tf, hlmyb <dig>  containing a transcriptional repressor-like motif pdlnld/elxig/s , was identified as an efficient inhibitor of chs_h1-activating tfs. comparative analyses of hop and a. thaliana tfs revealed a complex activation of pchs_h <dig> and pchs <dig> in combinatorial or independent manners.


CONCLUSIONS
this study on the sequences and functions of various lupulin gland-specific transcription factors provides insight into the complex character of the regulation of the chs_h <dig> gene that depends on variable activation by combinations of r2r3myb, bhlh and wdr tf homologues and inhibition by a myb repressor.
