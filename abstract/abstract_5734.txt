BACKGROUND
copy number variations  are a main source of genomic structural variations underlying animal evolution and production traits. here, with one pure-blooded angus bull as reference, we describe a genome-wide analysis of cnvs based on comparative genomic hybridization arrays in  <dig> chinese domesticated bulls and examined their effects on gene expression and cattle growth traits.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> copy number variable regions , covering  <dig> % of the bovine genome, in  <dig> taurine , together with  <dig> ones in  <dig> yaks  and  <dig> ones in  <dig> buffaloes . totally, we discovered  <dig> integrated cnvrs, with more “loss” events than both “gain” and “both” ones, and clearly clustered them into three cattle groups. interestingly, we confirmed their uneven distributions across chromosomes, and the differences of mitochondrion dna copy number . furthermore, we confirmed approximately  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  cnvrs span cattle genes and quantitative trait loci , respectively. finally, we confirmed  <dig> cnvrs in  <dig> chosen ones by using quantitative pcr, and further demonstrated that cnvr <dig> had significantly negative effects on expression of pla2g2d gene, and both cnvr <dig> and cnvr <dig> were associated with body measurements in chinese cattle, suggesting their key effects on gene expression and cattle traits.


CONCLUSIONS
the results advanced our understanding of cnv as an important genomic structural variation in taurine, yak and buffalo. this study provides a highly valuable resource for chinese cattle’s evolution and breeding researches.
