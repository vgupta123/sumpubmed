BACKGROUND
ocimum sanctum l.  family-lamiaceae is an important component of indian tradition of medicine as well as culture around the world, and hence is known as “holy basil” in india. this plant is mentioned in the ancient texts of ayurveda as an “elixir of life”  herb and worshipped for over  <dig> years due to its healing properties. although used in various ailments, validation of molecules for differential activities is yet to be fully analyzed, as about  <dig> % of the patents on this plant are on extracts or the plant parts, and mainly focussed on essential oil components. with a view to understand the full metabolic potential of this plant whole nuclear and chloroplast genomes were sequenced for the first time combining the sequence data from  <dig> libraries and three ngs platforms.


RESULTS
the saturated draft assembly of the genome was about  <dig> mb, along with the plastid genome of  <dig>  bp, turning out to be the smallest in lamiaceae. in addition to ssr markers,  <dig> proteins were identified as homologous to five important plant genomes. pathway analysis indicated an abundance of phenylpropanoids in o. sanctum. phylogenetic analysis for chloroplast proteome placed salvia miltiorrhiza as the nearest neighbor. comparison of the chemical compounds and genes availability in o. sanctum and s. miltiorrhiza indicated the potential for the discovery of new active molecules.


CONCLUSIONS
the genome sequence and annotation of o. sanctum provides new insights into the function of genes and the medicinal nature of the metabolites synthesized in this plant. this information is highly beneficial for mining biosynthetic pathways for important metabolites in related species.
