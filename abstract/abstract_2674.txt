BACKGROUND
horses develop recurrent airway obstruction  that resembles human bronchial asthma. differentiated primary equine bronchial epithelial cells  in culture that closely mimic the airway cells in vivo would be useful to investigate the contribution of bronchial epithelium in inflammation of airway diseases. however, because isolation and characterization of ebec cultures has been limited, we modified and optimized techniques of generating and culturing ebecs from healthy horses to mimic in vivo conditions.


RESULTS
large numbers of ebec were obtained by trypsin digestion and successfully grown for up to  <dig> passages with or without serum. however, serum or ultroser g proved to be essential for ebec differentiation on membrane inserts at ali. a pseudo-stratified muco-ciliary epithelium with basal cells was observed at differentiation. further, transepithelial resistance  was more consistent and higher in p <dig> cultures compared to p <dig> cultures while ciliation was delayed in p <dig> cultures.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides an efficient method for obtaining a high-yield of ebecs and for generating highly differentiated cultures. these ebec cultures can be used to study the formation of tight junction or to identify epithelial-derived inflammatory factors that contribute to lung diseases such as asthma.
