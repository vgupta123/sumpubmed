BACKGROUND
deep-level second generation sequencing  technologies are now being applied to non-model species as a viable and favourable alternative to sanger sequencing. large-scale snp discovery was undertaken in blackcurrant  using transcriptome-based 2gs  <dig> sequencing on the parental genotypes of a reference mapping population, to generate large numbers of novel markers for the construction of a high-density linkage map.


RESULTS
over  <dig>  reads were produced, from which a total of  <dig>  snps were found. a subset of polymorphic snps was selected to develop a 384-snp opa assay using the illumina beadxpress platform. additionally, the data enabled identification of  <dig>  novel est-ssrs. the selected snps and ssrs were validated across diverse ribes germplasm, including mapping populations and other selected ribes species.

snp-based maps were developed from two blackcurrant mapping populations, incorporating 48% and 27% of assayed snps respectively. a relatively high proportion of visually monomorphic snps were investigated further by quantitative trait mapping of theta score outputs from beadstudio analysis, and this enabled additional snps to be placed on the two maps.


CONCLUSIONS
the use of 2gs technology for the development of markers is superior to previously described methods, in both numbers of markers and biological informativeness of those markers. whilst the numbers of reads and assembled contigs were comparable to similar sized studies of other non-model species, here a high proportion of novel genes were discovered across a wide range of putative function and localisation. the potential utility of markers developed using the 2gs approach in downstream breeding applications is discussed.
