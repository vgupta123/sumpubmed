BACKGROUND
the emergence of next generation sequencing technologies has made it possible for individual investigators to generate gigabases of sequencing data per week. effective analysis and manipulation of these data is limited due to large file sizes, so even simple tasks such as data filtration and quality assessment have to be performed in several steps. this requires  interaction between the investigator and a bioinformatics/computational service provider. furthermore, such services are often performed using specialized computational facilities.


RESULTS
we present a windows-based application, slim-filter designed to interactively examine the statistical properties of sequencing reads produced by illumina genome analyzer and to perform a broad spectrum of data manipulation tasks including: filtration of low quality and low complexity reads; filtration of reads containing undesired subsequences ; excluding duplicated reads ; and sorting reads by copy numbers allowing for easy access and manual editing of the resulting files. slim-filter is organized as a sequence of windows summarizing the statistical properties of the reads. each data manipulation step has roll-back abilities, allowing for return to previous steps of the data analysis process. slim-filter is written in c++ and is compatible with fasta, fastq, and specialized as file formats presented in this manuscript. setup files and a userâ€™s manual are available for download at the supplementary web site .


CONCLUSIONS
the presented windows-based application has been developed with the goal of providing individual investigators with integrated sequencing reads analysis, curation, and manipulation capabilities.
