BACKGROUND
vancomycin has been the medication of last resort to cure infections caused by staphylococcus aureus since the increase in the prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus . some strains have developed vancomycin-intermediate resistance, which is generally associated with altered expression of or mutations in some part of the two-component system , such as grasr, vrasr, and walkr.


RESULTS
we deleted the airsr tcs in s. aureus nctc <dig> and compared the resultant transcript levels with those of its parent strain using microarray analysis. the results indicated that more than  <dig> genes that are related to cell wall metabolism were down-regulated in the airsr mutant. the airsr mutant exhibited reduced autolysis rates and reduced viability in the presence of vancomycin. real-time reverse transcription pcr and dna mobility shift assays verified that airr can directly bind to and regulate genes that function in cell wall metabolism  and autolysis .


CONCLUSIONS
airsr acts as a positive regulator in cell wall biosynthesis and turnover in staphylococcus aureus nctc <dig>
