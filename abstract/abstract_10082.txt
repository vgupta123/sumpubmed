BACKGROUND

clostridium difficile is a nosocomial pathogen prevalent in hospitals worldwide and increasingly common in the community. sequence differences have been shown to be present in the surface layer proteins  from different c. difficile ribotypes  however whether these differences influence severity of infection is still not clear.


RESULTS
we used a molecular evolutionary approach to analyse slps from twenty-six c. difficile rts representing different slpa sequences. we demonstrate that slps from rt  <dig> and  <dig> exhibit evidence of positive selection . we compared the effect of these slps to those purified from rt  <dig> and  <dig>  which did not exhibit ps, and demonstrate that the presence of sites under positive selection correlates with ability to activate macrophages. slps from rts  <dig> and  <dig> induced a more potent response in macrophages, with increased levels of il- <dig>  il-12p <dig>  il- <dig>  mip-1α, mip- <dig> production relative to rt  <dig> and  <dig>  furthermore, rts  <dig> and  <dig> induced higher expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig> and mhc ii on macrophages with decreased ability to phagocytose relative to lps.


CONCLUSIONS
these results tightly link sequence differences in c. difficile slps to disease susceptibility and severity, and suggest that positively selected sites in the slps may play a role in driving the emergence of hyper-virulent strains.
