BACKGROUND
late cerebral ischemia carries high morbidity and mortality after subarachnoid hemorrhage  due to reduced cerebral blood flow  and the subsequent cerebral ischemia which is associated with upregulation of contractile receptors in the vascular smooth muscle cells  via activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase  of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/ <dig> signal pathway. we hypothesize that sah initiates cerebrovascular erk1/ <dig> activation, resulting in receptor upregulation. the raf inhibitor will inhibit the molecular events upstream erk1/ <dig> and may provide a therapeutic window for treatment of cerebral ischemia after sah.


RESULTS
here we demonstrate that sah increases the phosphorylation level of erk1/ <dig> in cerebral vessels and reduces the neurology score in rats in additional with the cbf measured by an autoradiographic method. the intracisternal administration of sb-386023-b, a specific inhibitor of raf, given  <dig> h after sah, aborts the receptor changes and protects the brain from the development of late cerebral ischemia at  <dig> h. this is accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> in cerebrovascular smc. sah per se enhances contractile responses to endothelin- <dig> , 5-carboxamidotryptamine  and angiotensin ii , upregulates etb, 5-ht1b and at <dig> receptor mrna and protein levels. treatment with sb-386023-b given as late as at  <dig> h but not at  <dig> h after the sah significantly decreased the receptor upregulation, the reduction in cbf and the neurology score.


CONCLUSIONS
these results provide evidence for a role of the erk1/ <dig> pathway in regulation of expression of cerebrovascular smc receptors. it is suggested that raf inhibition may reduce late cerebral ischemia after sah and provides a realistic time window for therapy.
