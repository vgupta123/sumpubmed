BACKGROUND
plant architecture attributes, such as plant height, ear height, and internode number, have played an important role in the historical increases in grain yield, lodging resistance, and biomass in maize . analyzing the genetic basis of variation in plant architecture using high density qtl mapping will be of benefit for the breeding of maize for many traits. however, the low density of molecular markers in existing genetic maps has limited the efficiency and accuracy of qtl mapping. genotyping by sequencing  is an improved strategy for addressing a complex genome via next-generation sequencing technology. gbs has been a powerful tool for snp discovery and high-density genetic map construction. the creation of ultra-high density genetic maps using large populations of advanced recombinant inbred lines  is an efficient way to identify qtl for complex agronomic traits.


RESULTS
a set of  <dig> rils derived from inbreds ye <dig> and qi <dig> were generated and subjected to gbs. a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads with an average of  <dig>  reads per individual ril were generated, which is equivalent to approximately  <dig> -fold coverage of the maize b <dig> refgen_v <dig> genome for each individual ril. a high-density genetic map was constructed using  <dig> bin markers . the total genetic distance covered by the linkage map was  <dig>  cm and the average distance between adjacent markers was  <dig>  cm with a physical distance of about  <dig>  mb. our results demonstrated a relatively high degree of collinearity between the genetic map and the b <dig> reference genome. the quality and accuracy of the bin map for qtl detection was verified by the mapping of a known gene, pericarp color  <dig> , which controls the color of the cob, with a high lod value of  <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  using this high-density bin map,  <dig> qtl affecting plant architecture, including  <dig> for plant height,  <dig> for ear height, and seven for internode number were detected across three environments. interestingly, pqtl <dig>  which influences all three of these traits, was stably detected in three environments on chromosome  <dig> within an interval of  <dig>  mb. two myb transcription factor genes, grmzm2g <dig> and grmzm2g <dig>  which might regulate plant cell wall metabolism are the candidate genes for qph <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
here, an ultra-high density accurate linkage map for a set of maize rils was constructed using a gbs strategy. this map will facilitate identification of genes and exploration of qtl for plant architecture in maize. it will also be helpful for further research into the mechanisms that control plant architecture while also providing a basis for marker-assisted selection.
