BACKGROUND
kluyveromyces marxianus has recently become a species of interest for ethanol production since it can produce ethanol at high temperature and on a wide variety of substrates. however, the reason why this yeast can produce ethanol at high temperature is largely unknown.


RESULTS
the ethanol fermentation capability of k. marxianus gx-un <dig> at 40°С was found to be the same as that of saccharomyces cerevisiae at 34°С. zymogram analysis showed that alcohol dehydrogenase  <dig>  was largely induced during ethanol production, kmadh <dig> was constitutively expressed at a lower level and kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> were almost undetectable. the genes encoding the four alcohol dehydrogenases  were cloned from strain gx-un <dig>  each kmadh was expressed in escherichia coli and each recombinant protein was digested with enterokinase to remove the fusion protein. the optimum ph of the purified recombinant kmadh <dig> was  <dig>  and that of kmadh <dig>  kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> was  <dig> . the optimum temperatures of kmadh <dig>  kmadh <dig>  kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 45°c, respectively. the km values of the recombinant kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm for acetaldehyde and  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm for ethanol, respectively. the vmax values of the recombinant kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig>  μmol min-1 mg- <dig> for acetaldehyde and  <dig>  and  <dig>  μmol min-1 mg- <dig> for ethanol, respectively. kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> catalyze the oxidation reaction of ethanol to acetaldehyde but not the reduction reaction of acetaldehyde to ethanol, and the k
m
 values of the recombinant kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm for ethanol, respectively. the vmax values of the recombinant kmadh <dig> and kmadh <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig>  μmol min-1 mg- <dig> for ethanol, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
these data in this study collectively indicate that kmadh <dig> is the primary adh responsible for the production of ethanol from the reduction of acetaldehyde in k. marxianus. the relatively high optimum temperature of kmadh <dig> may partially explain the ability of k. marxianus to produce ethanol at high temperature. understanding the biochemical characteristics of kmadhs will enhance our fundamental knowledge of the metabolism of ethanol fermentation in k. marxianus.
