BACKGROUND
ganglioside biosynthesis occurs through a multi-enzymatic pathway which at the lactosylceramide step is branched into several biosynthetic series. lc <dig> synthase utilizes a variety of galactose-terminated glycolipids as acceptors by establishing a glycosidic bond in the beta- <dig> -linkage to glcnaac to extend the lacto- and neolacto-series gangliosides. in order to examine the lacto-series ganglioside functions in mice, we used gene knockout technology to generate lc <dig> synthase gene b3gnt5-deficient mice by two different strategies and compared the phenotypes of the two null mouse groups with each other and with their wild-type counterparts.


RESULTS
b3gnt <dig> gene knockout mutant mice appeared normal in the embryonic stage and, if they survived delivery, remained normal during early life. however, about 9% developed early-stage growth retardation, 11% died postnatally in less than  <dig> months, and adults tended to die in 5- <dig> months, demonstrating splenomegaly and notably enlarged lymph nodes. without lacto-neolacto series gangliosides, both homozygous and heterozygous mice gradually displayed fur loss or obesity, and breeding mice demonstrated reproductive defects. furthermore, b3gnt <dig> gene knockout disrupted the functional integrity of b cells, as manifested by a decrease in b-cell numbers in the spleen, germinal center disappearance, and less efficiency to proliferate in hybridoma fusion.


CONCLUSIONS
these novel results demonstrate unequivocally that lacto-neolacto series gangliosides are essential to multiple physiological functions, especially the control of reproductive output, and spleen b-cell abnormality. we also report the generation of anti-igg response against the lacto-series gangliosides 3'-isolm <dig> and 3',6'-isold <dig>
