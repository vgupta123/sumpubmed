BACKGROUND
the molecular mechanisms of genome reprogramming during transcriptional responses to stress are associated with specific chromatin modifications. available data, however, describe histone modifications only at individual plant genes induced by stress. we have no knowledge of chromatin modifications taking place at genes whose transcription has been down-regulated or on the genome-wide chromatin modification patterns that occur during the plant's response to dehydration stress.


RESULTS
using chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing  we established the whole-genome distribution patterns of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> mono-, di-, and tri-methylation  in arabidopsis thaliana during watered and dehydration stress conditions. in contrast to the relatively even distribution of h <dig> throughout the genome, the h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig> marks are predominantly located on genes. about 90% of annotated genes carry one or more of the h3k <dig> methylation marks. the h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> marks are more widely distributed  than the h3k4me <dig> marks , but the h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> levels changed only modestly during dehydration stress. by contrast, the h3k4me <dig> abundance changed robustly when transcripts levels from responding genes increased or decreased. in contrast to the prominent h3k4me <dig> peaks present at the 5'-ends of most transcribed genes, genes inducible by dehydration and aba displayed atypically broader h3k4me <dig> distribution profiles that were present before and after the stress.


CONCLUSIONS
a higher number  of annotated arabidopsis genes carry one or more types of h3k4me marks than previously reported. during the response to dehydration stress the changes in h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig> patterns show different dynamics and specific patterns at up-regulated, down-regulated, and unaffected genes. the different behavior of each methylation mark during the response process illustrates that they have distinct roles in the transcriptional response of implicated genes. the broad h3k4me <dig> distribution profiles on nucleosomes of stress-induced genes uncovered a specific chromatin pattern associated with many of the genes involved in the dehydration stress response.
