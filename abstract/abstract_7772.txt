BACKGROUND
the evolution of within-host growth rates by parasites is expected to depend on a trade-off between propagule production and virulence. the presence of coinfections, however, is thought to alter this trade-off, and hence alter the evolutionarily stable strategy  for the parasite. here i consider a model wherein the number of coinfections that are identical by descent can depend on the parasite's reproductive strategy. transmission success was treated as being either a negative-linear or a negative-exponential function of the total number of propagules produced by all coinfections.


RESULTS
increasing the number of unrelated coinfections either selected for a decrease in reproductive output by the parasite , or had no effect on the ess . nonetheless, the total number of propagules produced within each host increased in both cases. increasing the relatedness among coinfections, however, selected for reductions in parasite reproduction in both cases.


CONCLUSIONS
unrelated coinfection may increase overall parasite virulence, but the result stems from adding more infections rather than to more aggressive growth by the individual infections. however, all else being equal, if the coinfections are more related than expected by chance alone, then the total reproductive output by all coinfections would be expected to be reduced, resulting in reduced virulence.
