BACKGROUND
powdery mildew  is one of the most severe fungal diseases of cucurbits, but the molecular mechanisms underlying pm resistance in cucumber remain elusive. in this study, we developed a pm resistant segment substitution line ssl508- <dig> that carried a segment on chromosome five representing the pm <dig>  locus from pm resistant donor jin5- <dig> using marker-assisted backcrossing of an elite pm susceptible cucumber inbred line d <dig> 


RESULTS
whole-genome resequencing of ssl508- <dig>  jin5- <dig> and d <dig> was performed to identify the exact boundaries of the breakpoints for this introgression because of the low density of available single sequence repeat markers. this led to the identification of a ~ <dig>  mb substituted segment predicted to contain  <dig> genes. rna-seq was used to study gene expression differences in pm treated  and untreated  ssl508- <dig> and d <dig> lines. exactly  <dig>  and  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  were identified in ssl508- <dig> and d <dig>  respectively. of those,  <dig> degs were located in the ~ <dig>  mb segment interval. based on expression data and annotation, we identified  <dig> potential candidate genes that may participate in pm resistance afforded by pm <dig> , including two tandemly arrayed genes encoding receptor protein kinases, two transcription factors, two genes encoding remorin proteins, one gene encoding a p-type atpase and one gene encoding a 70 kda heat shock protein. the transcriptome data also revealed a complex regulatory network for pm <dig> -mediated pm resistance that may involve multiple signal regulators and transducers, cell wall modifications and the salicylic acid signaling pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings shed light on the cucumber pm defense mechanisms mediated by pm <dig>  and provided valuable information for the fine mapping of pm <dig>  and breeding of cucumber with enhanced resistance to pm.
