BACKGROUND
echinococcus granulosus  complex, the cause of cystic echinococcosis , infects humans and several other animal species worldwide and hence the disease is of public health importance. ten genetic variants, or genotypes designated as , are distributed worldwide based on genetic diversity. the objective of this study was to provide some sequence data and phylogeny of eg isolates recovered from the sudanese one-humped camel . fifty samples of hydatid cysts were collected from the one- humped camels  at taboul slaughter house, central sudan. dnas were extracted from protoscolices and/or associated germinal layers of hydatid cysts using a commercial kit. the mitochondrial nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig>  gene and the cytochrome c oxidase subunit  <dig>  gene were used as targets for polymerase chain reaction  amplification. the pcr products were purified and partial sequences were generated. sequences were further examined by sequence analysis and subsequent phylogeny to compare these sequences to those from known strains of eg circulating globally.


RESULTS
the identity of the pcr products were confirmed as nadh <dig> and cox <dig> nucleotide sequences using the basic local alignment search tool  of ncbi . the phylogenetic analysis showed that 98%  of the isolates clustered with echinococcus canadensis genotype  <dig> , whereas only one isolate  clustered with echinococcus ortleppi .


CONCLUSIONS
this investigation expands on the existing sequence data generated from eg isolates recovered from camel in the sudan. the circulation of the cattle genotype  in the one-humped camel is reported here for the first time.
