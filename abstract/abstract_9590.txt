BACKGROUND
nlrps  are members of nlr  protein family. recent researches have shown that nlrp genes play important roles in both mammalian innate immune system and reproductive system. several of nlrp genes were shown to be specifically expressed in the oocyte in mammals. the aim of the present work was to study how these genes evolved and diverged after their duplication, as well as whether natural selection played a role during their evolution.


RESULTS
by using in silico methods, we have evaluated the evolution and functional divergence of nlrp genes, in particular of mouse reproduction-related nlrp genes. we found that  major nlrp genes have been duplicated before the divergence of mammals, with certain lineage-specific duplications in primates  and in rodents ;  tandem duplication events gave rise to a mammalian reproduction-related nlrp cluster including nlrp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes;  the function of mammalian oocyte-specific nlrp genes  might have diverged during gene evolution;  recent segmental duplications concerning nlrp <dig> copies and vomeronasal  <dig> receptor encoding genes  have been undertaken in the mouse; and  duplicates of nlrp <dig> and  <dig> in the mouse might have been subjected to adaptive evolution.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study brings us novel information on the evolution of mammalian reproduction-related nlrps. on the one hand, nlrp genes duplicated and functionally diversified in mammalian reproductive systems . on the other hand, during evolution, different lineages adapted to develop their own nlrp genes, particularly in reproductive function .
