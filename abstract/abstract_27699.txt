BACKGROUND
chemoreception is based on the senses of smell and taste that are crucial for animals to find new food sources, shelter, and mates. the initial step in olfaction involves the translocation of odorants from the periphery through the aqueous lymph of the olfactory sensilla to the odorant receptors most likely by chemosensory proteins  or odorant binding proteins .


RESULTS
to better understand the roles of csps and obps in a coleopteran pest species, the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum , we performed transcriptome analyses of male and female antennae, heads, mouthparts, legs, and bodies, which revealed that all  <dig> csps and  <dig> of the  <dig> previously annotated obps are transcribed. only six of the  <dig> csp are significantly transcriptionally enriched in the main chemosensory tissues , whereas of the obps all eight members of the antenna binding proteins ii  subgroup,  <dig> of the  <dig> classic obp subgroup, the c + obp, and only five of the  <dig> c-obps show increased chemosensory tissue expression. by maldi-tof-tof ms protein fingerprinting, we confirmed three csps, four abpiis, three classic obps, and four c-obps in the antennae.


CONCLUSIONS
most of the classic obps and all abpiis are likely involved in chemoreception. a few are also present in other tissues such as odoriferous glands and testes and may be involved in release or transfer of chemical signals. the majority of the csps as well as the c-obps are not enriched in antennae or mouthparts, suggesting a more general role in the transport of hydrophobic molecules.
