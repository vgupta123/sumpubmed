BACKGROUND
the technical progress in the last decade has made it possible to sequence millions of dna reads in a relatively short time frame. several variant callers based on different algorithms have emerged and have made it possible to extract single nucleotide polymorphisms  out of the whole-genome sequence. often, only a few individuals of a population are sequenced completely and imputation is used to obtain genotypes for all sequence-based snp loci for other individuals, which have been genotyped for a subset of snps using a genotyping array.

methods
first, we compared the sets of variants detected with different variant callers, namely gatk, freebayes and samtools, and checked the quality of genotypes of the called variants in a set of  <dig> fully sequenced white and brown layers. second, we assessed the imputation accuracy  when imputing from high density snp array data to whole-genome sequence using data from around  <dig> individuals from six different generations. three different imputation programs  were checked in different validation scenarios.


RESULTS
there were  <dig> , <dig> snps detected by all three callers on the studied chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which was  <dig>  %  of snps detected by gatk  in total. genotype concordance  defined as the proportion of individuals whose array-derived genotypes are the same as the sequence-derived genotypes over all non-missing snps on the array were  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  . furthermore, the percentage of variants that had high values  for another three measures  were  <dig>  for gatk . with all imputation programs, correlation between original and imputed genotypes was > <dig>  on average with randomly masked  <dig> snps from the snp array and > <dig>  for a leave-one-out cross-validation within sequenced individuals.


CONCLUSIONS
performance of all variant callers studied was very good in general, particularly for gatk and samtools. fimpute performed slightly worse than minimac and impute <dig> in terms of genotype correlation, especially for snps with low minor allele frequency, while it had lowest numbers in mendelian conflicts in available father-progeny pairs. correlations of real and imputed genotypes remained constantly high even if individuals to be imputed were several generations away from the sequenced individuals.
