BACKGROUND
little is known about the affect of microgravity on gene expression, particularly in vivo during embryonic development. using transgenic zebrafish that express the gfp gene under the influence of a Î²-actin promoter, we examined the affect of simulated-microgravity on gfp expression in the heart, notochord, eye, somites, and rohon beard neurons. we exposed transgenic zebrafish to simulated-microgravity for different durations at a variety of developmental times in an attempt to determine periods of susceptibility for the different developing organ systems.


RESULTS
the developing heart had a period of maximum susceptibility between  <dig> and  <dig> hours after fertilization when there was an approximately 30% increase in gene expression. the notochord, eye, somites, and rohon beard neurons all showed periods of susceptibility occurring between  <dig> and  <dig> hours after fertilization. in addition, the notochord showed a second period of susceptibility between  <dig> and  <dig> hours after fertilization. interestingly, all organs appeared to be recovering by  <dig> hours after fertilization despite continued exposure to simulated-microgravity.


CONCLUSIONS
these results support the idea that exposure to microgravity can cause changes in gene expression in a variety of developing organ systems in live embryos and that there are periods of maximum susceptibility to the effects.
