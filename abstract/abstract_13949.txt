BACKGROUND
alternative splicing is crucial for proteome diversity and functional complexity in higher organisms. however, the alternative splicing landscape in fungi is still elusive.


RESULTS
the transcriptome of the filamentous fungus trichoderma longibrachiatum was deep sequenced using illumina solexa technology. a total of  <dig> splice junctions were discovered. analyses of alternative splicing events revealed that the number of all alternative splicing events , intron retentions , alternative 5’ splice sites , and alternative 3’ splice sites  is  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> -fold higher, respectively, than those observed in the fungus aspergillus oryzae using illumina solexa technology. this unexpectedly high ratio of alternative splicing suggests that alternative splicing is important to the transcriptome diversity of t. longibrachiatum. alternatively spliced introns had longer lengths, higher gc contents, and lower splice site scores than constitutive introns. further analysis demonstrated that the isoform relative frequencies were correlated with the splice site scores of the isoforms. moreover, comparative transcriptomics determined that most enzymes related to glycolysis and the citrate cycle and glyoxylate cycle as well as a few carbohydrate-active enzymes are transcriptionally regulated.


CONCLUSIONS
this study, consisting of a comprehensive analysis of the alternative splicing landscape in the filamentous fungus t. longibrachiatum, revealed an unexpectedly high ratio of alternative splicing events and provided new insights into transcriptome diversity in fungi.
