BACKGROUND
as habitat degradation and fragmentation continue to impact wildlife populations around the world, it is critical to understand the behavioral flexibility of species in these environments. in uganda, the mostly unprotected forest fragment landscape between the budongo and bugoma forests is a potential corridor for chimpanzees, yet little is known about the status of chimpanzee populations in these fragments.


RESULTS
from  <dig> through  <dig>  we noninvasively collected  <dig> chimpanzee fecal samples across 633 km <dig> and successfully genotyped  <dig>  at up to  <dig> microsatellite loci. these genotypes corresponded to  <dig> chimpanzees, with a mean of  <dig>  captures per individual. we obtained population size estimates of  <dig>  and  <dig>  chimpanzees using capture-with-replacement and spatially explicit capture–recapture models, respectively. the spatial clustering of associated genotypes suggests the presence of at least nine communities containing a minimum of 8– <dig> individuals each. putative community distributions defined by the locations of associated genotypes correspond well with the distribution of  <dig> y-chromosome haplotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
these census figures are more than three times greater than a previous estimate based on an extrapolation from small-scale nest count surveys that tend to underestimate population size. the distribution of genotype clusters and y-chromosome haplotypes together indicate the presence of numerous male philopatric chimpanzee communities throughout the corridor habitat. our findings demonstrate that, despite extensive habitat loss and fragmentation, chimpanzees remain widely distributed and exhibit distinct community home ranges. our results further imply that elusive and rare species may adapt to degraded habitats more successfully than previously believed. their long-term persistence is unlikely, however, if protection is not afforded to them and habitat loss continues unabated.
