BACKGROUND
the gastrointestinal tract is the first target for the potentially harmful effects of mycotoxins after intake of mycotoxin contaminated food or feed. with deoxynivalenol , t- <dig> toxin , fumonisin b <dig>  and zearalenone  being important fusarium toxins in the northern hemisphere, this study aimed to investigate in vitro the toxic effect of these mycotoxins on intestinal porcine epithelial cells derived from the jejunum . viability of ipec-j <dig> cells as well as the proportion of apoptotic and necrotic ipec-j <dig> cells was determined by flow cytometry after  <dig> h of exposure to the toxins. correlatively, the integrity of the intestinal epithelial cell monolayer was studied using transwellÂ® inserts, in which the trans-epithelial electrical resistance  and passage of the antibiotics doxycycline and paromomycin were used as endpoints.


RESULTS
we demonstrated that the percentage of annexin-v-fitc and pi negative  cells, annexin-v-fitc positive and pi negative  cells and annexin-v-fitc and pi positive  ipec-j <dig> cells showed a mycotoxin concentration-dependent relationship with t- <dig> toxin being the most toxic. moreover, the ratio between annexin-v-fitc positive and pi negative cells and annexin-v-fitc and pi positive cells varied depending on the type of toxin. more annexin-v-fitc and pi positive cells could be found after treatment with t- <dig> toxin, while more annexin-v-fitc positive and pi negative cells were found after exposure to don. consistent with the cytotoxicity results, both don and t- <dig> decreased teer and increased cellular permeability to doxycycline and paromomycin in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.


CONCLUSIONS
it was concluded that fusarium mycotoxins may severely disturb the intestinal epithelial barrier and promote passage of antibiotics.
