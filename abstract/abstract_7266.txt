BACKGROUND
low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits  strongly influence the bread-making quality of bread wheat. these proteins are encoded by a multi-gene family located at the glu-a <dig>  glu-b <dig> and glu-d <dig> loci on the short arms of homoeologous group  <dig> chromosomes, and show high allelic variation. to characterize the genetic and protein compositions of lmw-gs alleles, we investigated  <dig> aroona near-isogenic lines  using sds-page, 2d-page and the lmw-gs gene marker system. moreover, the composition of glutenin macro-polymers, dough properties and pan bread quality parameters were determined for functional analysis of lmw-gs alleles in the nils.


RESULTS
using the lmw-gs gene marker system, 14– <dig> lmw-gs genes were identified in individual nils. at the glu-a <dig> locus, two m-type and 2– <dig> i-type genes were identified and their allelic variants showed high polymorphisms in length and nucleotide sequences. the glu-a3d allele possessed three active genes, the highest number among glu-a <dig> alleles. at the glu-b <dig> locus, 2–3 m-type and 1–3 s-type genes were identified from individual nils. based on the different compositions of s-type genes, glu-b <dig> alleles were divided into two groups, one containing glu-b3a, b3b, b3f and b3g, and the other comprising glu-b3c, b3d, b3h and b3i. eight conserved genes were identified among glu-d <dig> alleles, except for glu-d3f. the protein products of the unique active genes in each nil were detected using protein electrophoresis. among glu- <dig> alleles, the glu-a3e genotype without i-type lmw-gs performed worst in almost all quality properties. glu-b3b, b3g and b3i showed better quality parameters than the other glu-b <dig> alleles, whereas the glu-b3c allele containing s-type genes with low expression levels had an inferior effect on bread-making quality. due to the conserved genes at glu-d <dig> locus, glu-d <dig> alleles showed no significant differences in effects on all quality parameters.


CONCLUSIONS
this work provided new insights into the composition and function of  <dig> lmw-gs alleles in bread wheat. the variation of i-type genes mainly contributed to the high diversity of glu-a <dig> alleles, and the differences among glu-b <dig> alleles were mainly derived from the high polymorphism of s-type genes. among lmw-gs alleles, glu-a3e and glu-b3c represented inferior alleles for bread-making quality, whereas glu-a3d, glu-b3b, glu-b3g and glu-b3i were correlated with superior bread-making quality. glu-d <dig> alleles played minor roles in determining quality variation in bread wheat. thus, lmw-gs alleles not only affect dough extensibility but greatly contribute to the dough resistance, glutenin macro-polymers and bread quality.
