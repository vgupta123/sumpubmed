BACKGROUND
gcn <dig> is a transcriptional coactivator with histone acetyltransferase activity that is conserved with regard to structure as well as its histone substrates throughout the eukaryotes. gene regulatory networks within cells are thought to be evolutionarily diverged. the use of evolutionarily divergent yeast species, such as s. cerevisiae and s. pombe, which can be studied under similar environmental conditions, provides an opportunity to examine the interface between conserved regulatory components and their cellular applications in different organisms.


RESULTS
we show that gcn <dig> is important for a common set of stress responses in evolutionarily diverged yeast species and that the activity of the conserved histone acetyltransferase domain is required. we define a group of kcl stress response genes in s. cerevisiae that are specifically dependent on gcn <dig>  gcn <dig> is localised to many gcn5-dependent genes including gcn <dig> repressed targets such as flo <dig>  gcn <dig> regulates divergent sets of kcl responsive genes in s. cerevisiae and s. pombe. genome-wide localization studies showed a tendency for redistribution of gcn <dig> during kcl stress adaptation in s. cerevisiae from short genes to the transcribed regions of long genes. an analogous redistribution was not observed in s. pombe.


CONCLUSIONS
gcn <dig> is required for the regulation of divergent sets of kcl stress-response genes in s. cerevisiae and s. pombe even though it is required a common group of stress responses, including the response to kcl. genes that are physically associated with gcn <dig> require its activity for their repression or activation during stress adaptation, providing support for a role of gcn <dig> as a corepressor as well as a coactivator. the tendency of gcn <dig> to re-localise to the transcribed regions of long genes during kcl stress adaptation suggests that gcn <dig> plays a specific role in the expression of long genes under adaptive conditions, perhaps by regulating transcriptional elongation as has been seen for gcn <dig> in s. pombe. interestingly an analogous redistribution of gcn <dig> is not seen in s. pombe. the study thus provides important new insights in relation to why coregulators like gcn <dig> are required for the correct expression of some genes but not others.
