BACKGROUND
barley is an important cereal crop cultivated for malt and ruminant feed and in certain regions it is used for human consumption. it is vulnerable to numerous foliar diseases including barley leaf rust caused by the pathogen puccinia hordei.


RESULTS
a temporarily designated resistance locus rphcantala  identified in the australian hordeum vulgare l. cultivar ‘cantala’ displayed an intermediate to low infection type  against the p. hordei pathotype 253p- . phenotypic assessment of a ‘ci 9214’  x ‘stirling’   doubled haploid  population at the seedling stage using p. hordei pathotype 253p-, confirmed that rphc was monogenically inherited. marker-trait association analysis of rphc in the ci 9214/stirling dh population using  <dig>  dart-seq markers identified a highly significant  single peak on the long arm of chromosome 5h . further tests of allelism determined that rphc was genetically independent of rph <dig>  rph <dig>  rph <dig>  rph <dig> and rph <dig>  and was an allele of rph <dig> , which also maps to 5hl.


CONCLUSIONS
multipathotype tests and subsequent pedigree analysis determined that  <dig> related australian barley varieties  carry rphc and that the likely source of this resistance is via a czechoslovakian landrace lv-kvasice-na-morave transferred through common ancestral cultivars ‘hanna’ and ‘abed binder’. rphc is an allele of rph <dig>  and is therefore designated rph <dig> am. bioinformatic analysis using sequence arrays from dart-seq markers in linkage disequilibrium with rph <dig> am identified possible candidates for further gene cloning efforts and marker development at the rph9/rph12/rph <dig> am locus.
