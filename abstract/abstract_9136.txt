BACKGROUND
gene trees that arise in the context of reconstructing the evolutionary history of polyploid species are often multiply-labeled, that is, the same leaf label can occur several times in a single tree. this property considerably complicates the task of forming a consensus of a collection of such trees compared to usual phylogenetic trees.


RESULTS
we present a method for computing a consensus tree of multiply-labeled trees. as with the well-known greedy consensus tree approach for phylogenetic trees, our method first breaks the given collection of gene trees into a set of clusters. it then aims to insert these clusters one at a time into a tree, starting with the clusters that are supported by most of the gene trees. as the problem to decide whether a cluster can be inserted into a multiply-labeled tree is computationally hard, we have developed a heuristic method for solving this problem.


CONCLUSIONS
we illustrate the applicability of our method using two collections of trees for plants of the genus silene, that involve several allopolyploids at different levels.
