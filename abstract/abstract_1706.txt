BACKGROUND
microarray is a high-throughput technology to study expression of thousands of genes in parallel. a critical aspect of microarray production is the design aimed at space optimization while maximizing the number of gene probes and their replicates to be spotted.


RESULTS
we have developed a software called 'arrayd' that offers various alternative design solutions for an array given a set of user requirements. the user feeds the following inputs: type of source plates to be used, number of gene probes to be printed, number of replicates and number of pins to be used for printing. the solutions are stored in a text file. the choice of a design solution to be used will be governed by the spotting chemistry to be used and the accuracy of the robot.


CONCLUSIONS
arrayd is a software for standard cartesian robots. the software aids users in preparing a judicious and elegant design. arrayd is universally applicable and is available at .
