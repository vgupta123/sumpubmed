BACKGROUND
during the colonization of the world, after dispersal out of african, modern humans encountered changeable environments and substantial phenotypic variations that involve diverse behaviors, lifestyles and cultures, were generated among the different modern human populations.


RESULTS
here, we study the level of population differentiation among different populations of human genes. intriguingly, genes involved in osteoblast development were identified as being enriched with higher fst snps, a result consistent with the proposed role of the skeletal system in accounting for variation among human populations. genes involved in the development of hair follicles, where hair is produced, were also found to have higher levels of population differentiation, consistent with hair morphology being a distinctive trait among human populations. other genes that showed higher levels of population differentiation include those involved in pigmentation, spermatid, nervous system and organ development, and some metabolic pathways, but few involved with the immune system. disease-related genes demonstrate excessive snps with lower levels of population differentiation, probably due to purifying selection. surprisingly, we find that mendelian-disease genes appear to have a significant excessive of snps with high levels of population differentiation, possibly because the incidence and susceptibility of these diseases show differences among populations. as expected, microrna regulated genes show lower levels of population differentiation due to purifying selection.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis demonstrates different level of population differentiation among human populations for different gene groups.
