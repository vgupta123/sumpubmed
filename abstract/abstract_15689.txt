BACKGROUND
cotton is the leading fiber crop worldwide. gossypium barbadense is an important species of cotton because of its extra-long staple fibers with superior luster and silkiness. however, a systematic analysis and utilization of cdna sequences from g. barbadense fiber development remains understudied.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  high quality sequences were generated from two non-normalized cdna libraries prepared by using a mixture of g. barbadense hai <dig> fibers and ovules. after assembly processing, a set of  <dig>  unigenes were obtained. of those,  <dig>  were matched to known proteins and  <dig>  were assigned to functional categories. the molecular functions of these unigenes were mostly related to binding and catalytic activity, and carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolisms were major contributors among the subsets of metabolism. sequences comparison between g. barbadense and g. hirsutum revealed that  <dig>  unigenes from g. barbadense were detected the similarity with those released publicly in g. hirsutum, however, the remaining  <dig> sequences had no hits against g. hirsutum unigenes database. furthermore,  <dig>  putative ests indels loci involved in the orthologous and/or homoeologous differences between/within g. barbadense and g. hirsutum were discovered by in silico analyses, and  <dig>  indel markers were developed by ests with more than five insertions or deletions. by gel electrophoresis combined with sequencing verification,  <dig> % candidate indel loci were reconfirmed orthologous and/or homoeologous loci polymorphisms using g. hirsutum acc tm- <dig> and g. barbadense cv hai <dig>  blastx result showed among  <dig>  indel loci,  <dig> with significant function similarity with known genes associated with secondary wall synthesis process, indicating the important roles in fiber quality in tetraploid cultivated cotton species.


CONCLUSIONS
sequence comparisons and indel markers development will lay the groundwork for promoting the identification of genes related to superior agronomic traits, genetic differentiation and comparative genomic studies between g. hirsutum and g. barbadense.
