BACKGROUND
a detailed knowledge about spatial and temporal gene expression is important for understanding both the function of genes and their evolution. for the vast majority of species, transcriptomes are still largely uncharacterized and even in those where substantial information is available it is often in the form of partially sequenced transcriptomes. with the development of next generation sequencing, a single experiment can now simultaneously identify the transcribed part of a species genome and estimate levels of gene expression.


RESULTS
mrna from actively growing needles of norway spruce  was sequenced using next generation sequencing technology. in total, close to  <dig> million fragments with a length of  <dig> bp were sequenced resulting in  <dig> gbp of raw data. a de novo assembly of these reads, together with publicly available expressed sequence tag  data from norway spruce, was used to create a reference transcriptome. of the  <dig>  puts  longer than  <dig> bp in this reference assembly,  <dig> % show similarity to ests from other spruce species and of the remaining puts,  <dig>  show similarity to protein sequences from other plant species, leaving  <dig>  puts with limited similarity to currently available plant proteins. by predicting coding frames and comparing not only the norway spruce puts, but also puts from the close relatives picea glauca and picea sitchensis to both pinus taeda and taxus mairei, we obtained estimates of synonymous and non-synonymous divergence among conifer species. in addition, we detected close to  <dig>  snps of high quality and estimated gene expression differences between samples collected under dark and light conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
our study yielded a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms as well as estimates of gene expression on transcriptome scale. in agreement with a recent study we find that the synonymous substitution rate per year  is an order of magnitude smaller than values reported for angiosperm herbs. however, if one takes generation time into account, most of this difference disappears. the estimates of the dn/ds ratio  reported here are in general much lower than  <dig> and only a few genes showed a ratio larger than  <dig>
