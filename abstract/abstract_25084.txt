BACKGROUND
the miniature pig provides an excellent experimental model for tooth morphogenesis because its diphyodont and heterodont dentition resembles that of humans. however, little information is available on the process of tooth development or the exact molecular mechanisms controlling tooth development in miniature pigs or humans. thus, the analysis of gene expression related to each stage of tooth development is very important.


RESULTS
in our study, after serial sections were made, the development of the crown of the miniature pigsâ€™ mandibular deciduous molar could be divided into five main phases: dental lamina stage , bud stage , cap stage , early bell stage , and late bell stage . total rna was isolated from the tooth germ of miniature pig embryos at e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig>  and a cdna library was constructed. then, we identified cdna sequences on a large scale screen for cdna profiles in the developing mandibular deciduous molars  of miniature pigs using illumina solexa deep sequencing. microarray assay was used to detect the expression of genes. lastly, through unigene sequence analysis and cdna expression pattern analysis at e <dig> and e <dig>  we found that  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes during the four periods are highly conserved genes homologous with known homo sapiens genes. furthermore, there were  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated genes in the miniature pig that were highly homologous to homo sapiens genes compared with those in the mouse.


CONCLUSIONS
our results not only identify the specific transcriptome and cdna profile in developing mandibular deciduous molars of the miniature pig, but also provide useful information for investigating the molecular mechanism of tooth development in the miniature pig.
