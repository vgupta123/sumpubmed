BACKGROUND
several matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry protocols, which differ in identification criteria, have been developed for mold and dermatophyte identification. currently, the most widely used approach is bruker technology, although no consensus concerning the log threshold has been established. furthermore, it remains unknown how far increasing the number of spots to compare results might improve identification performance.

in this study, we used in-house and bruker reference databases as well as a panel of  <dig> isolates belonging to  <dig> species to test various thresholds. ten distinct identification algorithms requiring one to four spots were tested.


RESULTS
our findings indicate that optimal results were obtained by applying a decisional algorithm in which only the highest score of four spots was taken into account with a  <dig>  log threshold. testing the entire panel enabled identification of  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of isolates, with a positive predictive value  of  <dig> at the genus level for both databases as well as  <dig>  ppv  and  <dig>  ppv  at the species level. applying the same rules to the isolates for which the species were represented by at least three strains in the database enabled identification of  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of isolates, with  <dig> ppv at the genus level for both databases as well as  <dig>  ppv  and  <dig>  ppv  at the species level.


CONCLUSIONS
depositing four spots per extract and lowering the threshold to  <dig> , a threshold which is notably lower than that recommended for bacterial identification, decreased the number of unidentified specimens without altering the reliability of the accepted results. nevertheless, regardless of the criteria used for mold and dermatophyte identification, commercial databases require optimization.
