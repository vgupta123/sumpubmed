BACKGROUND
individual genotypes at specific loci can result in different patterns of dna methylation. these methylation quantitative trait loci  influence methylation across extended genomic regions and may underlie direct snp associations or gene-environment interactions. we hypothesized that the detection of meqtls varies with ancestral population, developmental stage, and tissue type. we explored this by analyzing seven datasets that varied by ancestry , developmental stage , and tissue type  with genome-wide dna methylation and snp data. we tested for meqtls by constructing linear regression models of methylation levels at each cpg site on snp genotypes within 50Â kb under an additive model controlling for multiple tests.


RESULTS
most meqtls mapped to intronic regions, although a limited number appeared to occur in synonymous or nonsynonymous coding snps. we saw significant overlap of meqtls between ancestral groups, developmental stages, and tissue types, with the highest rates of overlap within the four brain regions. compared with a random group of snps with comparable frequencies, meqtls were more likely to be 1) represented among the most associated snps in the wtccc bipolar disorder results and 2) located in microrna binding sites.


CONCLUSIONS
these data give us insight into how snps impact gene regulation and support the notion that peripheral blood may be a reliable correlate of physiological processes in other tissues.
