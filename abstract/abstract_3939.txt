BACKGROUND
candida albicans is a diploid pathogenic fungus not yet amenable to routine genetic investigations. understanding aspects of the regulation of its biological functions and the assembly of its protein complexes would lead to further insight into the biology of this common disease-causing microbial agent.


RESULTS
we have developed a toolbox allowing in vivo protein tagging by pcr-mediated homologous recombination with tap, ha and myc tags. the transformation cassettes were designed to accommodate a common set of integration primers. the tagged proteins can be used to perform tandem affinity purification  or chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis . tandem affinity purification of c. albicans nop <dig> revealed the high conservation of the small processome composition in yeasts. data obtained with in vivo tap-tagged tbf <dig>  cbf <dig> and mcm <dig> recapitulates previously published genome-wide location profiling by chip-chip. we also designed a new reporter system for in vivo analysis of transcriptional activity of gene loci in c. albicans.


CONCLUSIONS
this toolbox provides a basic setup to perform purification of protein complexes and increase the number of annotated transcriptional regulators and genetic circuits in c. albicans.
