BACKGROUND
dna extraction methods for pcr-quality dna from calluses and plants are not time efficient, since they require that the tissues be ground in liquid nitrogen, followed by precipitation of the dna pellet in ethanol, washing and drying the pellet, etc. the need for a rapid and simple procedure is urgent, especially when hundreds of samples need to be analyzed. here, we describe a simple and efficient method of isolating high-quality genomic dna for pcr amplification and enzyme digestion from calluses, various wild-type and transgenic plants.


RESULTS
we developed new rapid and reliable genomic dna extraction method. with our developed method, plant genomic dna extraction could be performed within  <dig> min. the method was as follows. plant tissue was homogenized with salt dna extraction buffer using hand-operated homogenizer and extracted by phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol . after centrifugation, the supernatant was directly used for dna template for pcr, resulting in successful amplification for rapd from various sources of plants and specific foreign genes from transgenic plants. after precipitating the supernatant, the dna was completely digested by restriction enzymes.


CONCLUSIONS
this dna extraction procedure promises simplicity, speed, and efficiency, both in terms of time and the amount of plant sample required. in addition, this method does not require expensive facilities for plant genomic dna extraction.
