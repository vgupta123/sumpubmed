BACKGROUND
rice transcription regulator oswrky <dig> influences the functioning of more than  <dig> genes in multiple signalling pathways, with roles in disease resistance, redox homeostasis, abiotic stress responses, and development.


RESULTS
to determine the putative transcriptional regulation mechanism of oswrky <dig>  the putative cis-acting elements of oswrky13-influenced genes were analyzed using the whole genome expression profiling of oswrky13-activated plants generated with the affymetrix genechip rice genome array. at least  <dig> transcription factor genes were influenced by oswrky <dig>  and  <dig> of them were downregulated. the promoters of oswrky13-upregulated genes were overrepresented with w-boxes for wrky protein binding, whereas the promoters of oswrky13-downregulated genes were enriched with cis-elements putatively for binding of myb and ap2/erebp types of transcription factors. consistent with the distinctive distribution of these cis-elements in up- and downregulated genes, nine wrky genes were influenced by oswrky <dig> and the promoters of five of them were bound by oswrky <dig> in vitro; all seven differentially expressed ap2/erebp genes and six of the seven differentially expressed myb genes were suppressed by in oswrky13-activated plants. a subset of oswrky13-influenced wrky genes were involved in host-pathogen interactions.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that oswrky13-mediated signalling pathways are partitioned by different transcription factors. wrky proteins may play important roles in the monitoring of oswrky13-upregulated genes and genes involved in pathogen-induced defence responses, whereas myb and ap2/erebp proteins may contribute most to the control of oswrky13-downregulated genes.
