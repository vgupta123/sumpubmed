BACKGROUND
flavin binding proteins  plays a critical role in several biological functions such as electron transport system . these flavoproteins contain very tightly bound, sometimes covalently, flavin adenine dinucleotide  or flavin mono nucleotide . the interaction between flavin nucleotide and amino acids of flavoprotein is essential for their functionality. thus identification of fad interacting residues in a fbp is an important step for understanding their function and mechanism.


RESULTS
in this study, we describe models developed for predicting fad interacting residues using  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> window pattern. support vector machine  based models have been developed using binary pattern of amino acid sequence of protein and achieved maximum accuracy  <dig> % with mathew's correlation coefficient   <dig>  and area under curve   <dig> . the performance of these models have been improved significantly from  <dig> % to  <dig> % with mcc  <dig>  and auc  <dig> , when evolutionary information is used as input in svm. the evolutionary information was generated in form of position specific score matrix  profile by using psi-blast at e-value  <dig> . all models were developed on  <dig> non-redundant fad binding protein chains containing  <dig> fad interacting residues and evaluated using fivefold cross-validation technique.


CONCLUSIONS
this study suggests that evolutionary information of  <dig> amino acid patterns perform best for fad interacting residues prediction. we also developed a web server which predicts fad interacting residues in a protein which is freely available for academics.
