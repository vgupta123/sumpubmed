BACKGROUND
the detection of cis-regulatory modules  that mediate transcriptional responses in eukaryotes remains a key challenge in the postgenomic era. a crm is characterized by a set of co-occurring transcription factor binding sites . in silico methods have been developed to search for crms by determining the combination of tfbs that are statistically overrepresented in a certain geneset. most of these methods solve this combinatorial problem by relying on computational intensive optimization methods. as a result their usage is limited to finding crms in small datasets  and using binding sites for a restricted number of transcription factors  out of which the optimal module will be selected.


RESULTS
we present an itemset mining based strategy for computationally detecting cis-regulatory modules  in a set of genes. we tested our method by applying it on a large benchmark data set, derived from a chip-chip analysis and compared its performance with other well known cis-regulatory module detection tools.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that by exploiting the computational efficiency of an itemset mining approach and combining it with a well-designed statistical scoring scheme, we were able to prioritize the biologically valid crms in a large set of coregulated genes using binding sites for a large number of potential tfs as input.
