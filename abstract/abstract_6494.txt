BACKGROUND
dengue virus , the most widely prevalent arbovirus, continues to be a threat to human health in the tropics and subtropics. early and rapid detection of denv infection during the acute phase of illness is crucial for proper clinical patient management and preventing the spread of infection. the aim of the current study was to develop a specific, sensitive, and robust reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification  assay for detection and differentiation of denv1- <dig> serotypes.


RESULTS
the method detection primers, which were designed to target the different denv serotypes, were identified by inspection of multiple sequence alignments of the non-structural protein  2a of denv <dig>  ns4b of denv <dig>  ns4a of denv <dig> and the 3′ untranslated region of the ns protein of denv <dig>  no cross-reactions of the four serotypes were observed during the tests. the detection limits of the denv1-4-specific rt-lamp assays were approximately 10-copy templates per reaction. the rt-lamp assays were ten-fold more sensitive than rt-pcr or real-time pcr. the diagnostic rate was 100 % for clinical strains of denv, and  <dig>  % of the denv-infected patients whose samples were tested were detected by rt-lamp. importantly, no false-positives were detected with the new equipment and methodology that was used to avoid aerosol contamination of the samples.


CONCLUSIONS
the rt-lamp method used in our study is specific, sensitive, and suitable for further investigation as a useful alternative to the current methods used for clinical diagnosis of denv1- <dig>  especially in hospitals and laboratories that lack sophisticated diagnostic systems.
