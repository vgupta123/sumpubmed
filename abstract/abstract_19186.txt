BACKGROUND
nonesterified fatty acids  are involved in proinflammatory processes in cattle, including in the increased expression of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells. however, the mechanisms underlying these effects are still unknown. the aim of this study was to assess the effects of nefas on the intracellular calcium  influx, nitric oxide production, and icam- <dig> and il- <dig> expression in primary bovine umbilical vein endothelial cells .


RESULTS
myristic , palmitic , stearic , oleic  and linoleic acid  rapidly increased ca2+i. the calcium response to all tested nefas showed an extracellular calcium dependence and only the la response was significantly inhibited until the intracellular calcium was chelated. the ec <dig> values for ma and la were 125 μm and 37 μm, respectively, and the ma and la effects were dependent on calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum stores and on the l-type calcium channels. only the calcium response to ma was significantly reduced by gw <dig>  a selective g-protein-coupled free fatty acid receptor  antagonist. we also detected a functional ffar1/gpr <dig> protein in buvecs by using western blotting and the ffar1/gpr <dig> agonist tak- <dig>  only la increased the cellular nitric oxide levels in a calcium-dependent manner. la stimulation but not ma stimulation increased icam- <dig> and il-8-expression in buvecs. this effect was inhibited by gw <dig>  an antagonist of ffar1/gpr <dig>  but not by u- <dig>  a phospholipase c inhibitor.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings strongly suggest that each individual nefa stimulates endothelial cells in a different way, with clearly different effects on intracellular calcium mobilization, no production, and il- <dig> and icam- <dig> expression in primary buvecs. these findings not only extend our understanding of nefa-mediated diseases in ruminants, but also provide new insight into the different molecular mechanisms involved during endothelial cell activation by nefas.
