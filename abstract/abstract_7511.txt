BACKGROUND
the inferior spikelets are defined to be those at portions where the grains receive less photosynthetic products during the seed development. the typical inferior spikelets are physically located on the proximal secondary branches in a rice panicle and traditionally characterized by a later flowering time and a slower grain-filling rate, compared to those so-called superior spikelets. grains produced on the inferior spikelets are consequently under-developed and lighter in weight than those formed on the superior spikelets. micrornas  are recognized as key players in regulating plant development through post-transcriptional gene regulations. we previously presented the evidence that mirnas may influence grain-filling rate and played a role in determining the grain weight and yield in rice.


RESULTS
in this study, further analyses of the expressed small rnas in superior and inferior spikelets were conducted at five distinct developmental stages of grain development. totally,  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were analyzed, showing a differential expression of  <dig> known mirnas between superior and inferior spikelets with higher expression levels of most mirnas associated with the superior than the inferior spikelets during the early stage of grain filling. genes targeted by those differentially expressed mirnas  were recognized to play roles in multiple developmental and signaling pathways related to plant hormone homeostasis and starch accumulation.


CONCLUSIONS
our data established a complicated link between mirna dynamics and the traditional role of hormones in grain filling and development, providing new insights into the widely accepted concepts of the so-called superior and inferior spikelets in rice production.
