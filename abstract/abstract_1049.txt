BACKGROUND
magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive method of evaluating embryonic development. diffusion tensor imaging , based on the directional diffusivity of water molecules, is an established method of evaluating tissue structure. yet embryonic motion degrades the in vivo acquisition of long-duration dti. we used a dual-cooling technique to avoid motion artifact and aimed to investigate whether dti can be used to monitor chick embryonic skeletal muscle development in ovo, and to investigate the correlation between quantitative dti parameters fractional anisotropy  and fiber length and quantitative histologic parameters fiber area percentage  and limb length.


RESULTS
from  <dig> normally developing chick embryos,  <dig> were randomly chosen each day from incubation days  <dig> to  <dig> and scanned using  <dig>  tesla magnetic resonance imaging. a dual-cooling technique is used before and during imaging. eggs were cracked for making histological specimen after imaging.  <dig> eggs were serially imaged from days  <dig> to  <dig>  we show that skeletal muscle fibers can be tracked in hind limb in dti beginning with incubation day  <dig>  our data shows a good positive correlation between quantitative dti and histologic parameters . the result of tracked fibers in dti during incubation corresponds to the development of chick embryonic skeletal muscle as reported in the literature.


CONCLUSIONS
diffusion tensor imaging can provide a noninvasive means of evaluating skeletal muscle development in ovo.
