BACKGROUND
horizontal gene transfer  has been suggested as the mechanism by which various plant parasitic nematode species have obtained genes important in parasitism. in particular, cellulase genes have been acquired by plant parasitic nematodes that allow them to digest plant cell walls. unlike the typical glycoside hydrolase  family  <dig> cellulase genes which are found in several nematode species from the order tylenchida, members of the gh <dig> cellulase have only been identified in a cluster including the families parasitaphelenchidae  and aphelenchoididae, and their origins remain unknown.


RESULTS
in order to investigate the distribution and evolution of gh <dig> cellulase genes in nematodes and fungi we performed a wide ranging screen for novel putative gh <dig> sequences. this revealed that the sequences are widespread mainly in ascomycetous fungi and have so far been found in a single major nematode lineage. close relationships between the sequences from nematodes and fungi were found through our phylogenetic analyses. an intron position is shared by sequences from bursaphelenchus nematodes and several ascomycetous fungal species.


CONCLUSIONS
the close phylogenetic relationships and conserved gene structure between the sequences from nematodes and fungi strongly supports the hypothesis that nematode gh <dig> cellulase genes were acquired via hgt from fungi. the rapid duplication and turnover of these genes within bursaphelenchus genomes demonstrate that useful sequences acquired via hgt can become established in the genomes of recipient organisms and may open novel niches for these organisms to exploit.
