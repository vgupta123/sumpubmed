BACKGROUND
mycoplasma hominis is associated with pelvic inflammatory disease, bacterial vaginosis, post partum fever, sepsis and infections of the central nervous system often leading to serious conditions. association with development of female infertility has also been suggested, but different publications present different results. we developed a sensitive and fast diagnostic real-time pcr to test clinical samples from women undergoing laparoscopic examination before fertility treatment. to develop a test for the detection and quantification of m. hominis we selected a housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , as a target.


RESULTS
real-time pcr was optimized to detect  <dig> copies of m. hominis pg <dig> genomic dna. a fluorescence signal was measured for all  <dig> other m. hominis isolates, and melting curves analysis showed variations in the melting temperature in agreement with sequence variation in the region of the probes. there was no amplification of other mycoplasmal dna and human dna. eighty-three patient cervical swab samples from infertile women were cultured for m. hominis in the bea medium. two of the samples  were positive after  <dig> hours of incubation. the real-time pcr detected the same two samples positive, and the dna concentrations in the clinical specimens were calculated to  <dig>  copies/ml and  <dig>  copies/ml, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the results demonstrate that real-time pcr may prove to be a rapid alternative to the traditional cultivation method. information on bacterial load in genital swabs can be obtained. the assay allowed detection of m. hominis in a closed system reducing the risk of contamination by amplicon carry-over.
