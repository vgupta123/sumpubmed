BACKGROUND
multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat  analysis  is a prominent subtyping method to resolve closely related microbial isolates to provide information for establishing genetic patterns among isolates and to investigate disease outbreaks. the usefulness of mlva was recently demonstrated for the avian major pathogen chlamydophila psittaci. in the present study, we developed a similar method for another pathogen of birds: the filamentous fungus aspergillus fumigatus.


RESULTS
we selected  <dig> vntr markers located on  <dig> different chromosomes  of a. fumigatus. these markers were tested with  <dig> unrelated isolates from different hosts or their environment . the simpson index for individual markers ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . a combined loci index calculated with all the markers yielded an index of  <dig> . in a second step, the panel of  <dig> markers was used in different epidemiological situations and tested on  <dig> isolates, including  <dig> isolates from birds in guangxi province in china,  <dig> isolates collected in two duck farms in france and  <dig> environmental isolates from a turkey hatchery in france. a database was created with the results of the present study http://minisatellites.u-psud.fr/mlvanet/. three major clusters of isolates were defined by using the graphing algorithm termed minimum spanning tree . the first cluster comprised most of the avian isolates collected in the two duck farms in france, the second cluster comprised most of the avian isolates collected in poultry farms in china and the third one comprised most of the isolates collected in the turkey hatchery in france.


CONCLUSIONS
mlva displayed excellent discriminatory power. the method showed a good reproducibility. mst analysis revealed an interesting clustering with a clear separation between isolates according to their geographic origin rather than their respective hosts.
