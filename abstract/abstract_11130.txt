BACKGROUND
plant ca2+ signals are involved in a wide array of intracellular signaling pathways after pest invasion. ca2+-binding sensory proteins such as ca2+-dependent protein kinases  have been predicted to mediate the signaling following ca2+ influx after insect herbivory. however, until now this prediction was not testable.


RESULTS
to investigate the roles cpks play in a herbivore response-signaling pathway, we screened the characteristics of arabidopsis cpk mutants damaged by a feeding generalist herbivore, spodoptera littoralis. following insect attack, the cpk <dig> and cpk <dig> mutants showed lower transcript levels of plant defensin gene pdf <dig>  compared to wild-type plants. the cpk cascade was not directly linked to the herbivory-induced signaling pathways that were mediated by defense-related phytohormones such as jasmonic acid and ethylene. cpk <dig> was also suggested to be involved in a negative feedback regulation of the cytosolic ca2+ levels after herbivory and wounding damage. in vitro kinase assays of cpk <dig> protein with a suite of substrates demonstrated that the protein phosphorylates transcription factors  in the presence of ca2+. cpk <dig> strongly phosphorylated only hsfb2a, irrespective of the presence of ca2+. furthermore, in vivo agroinfiltration assays showed that cpk3-or cpk13-derived phosphorylation of a heat shock factor  promotes pdf <dig>  transcriptional activation in the defense response.


CONCLUSIONS
these results reveal the involvement of two arabidopsis cpks  in the herbivory-induced signaling network via hsfb2a-mediated regulation of the defense-related transcriptional machinery. this cascade is not involved in the phytohormone-related signaling pathways, but rather directly impacts transcription factors for defense responses.
