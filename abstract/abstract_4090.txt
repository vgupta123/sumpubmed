BACKGROUND
many multicellular eukaryotes have two types of spliceosomes for the removal of introns from messenger rna precursors. the major  spliceosome processes the vast majority of introns, referred to as u2-type introns, while the minor  spliceosome removes a small fraction  of introns, referred to as u12-type introns. u12-type introns have distinct sequence elements and usually occur together in genes with u2-type introns. a phylogenetic distribution of u12-type introns shows that the minor splicing pathway appeared very early in eukaryotic evolution and has been lost repeatedly.


RESULTS
we have investigated the evolution of u12-type introns among eighteen metazoan genomes by analyzing orthologous u12-type intron clusters. examination of gain, loss, and type switching shows that intron type is remarkably conserved among vertebrates. among  <dig> intron clusters, only eight show intron loss in any vertebrate species and only five show conversion between the u <dig> and the u2-type. although there are only nineteen u12-type introns in drosophila melanogaster, we found one case of u <dig> to u12-type conversion, apparently mediated by the activation of cryptic u <dig> splice sites early in the dipteran lineage. overall, loss of u12-type introns is more common than conversion to u2-type and the u <dig> to u <dig> conversion occurs more frequently among introns of the gt-ag subtype than among introns of the at-ac subtype. we also found support for natural u12-type introns with non-canonical terminal dinucleotides  that have not been previously reported.


CONCLUSIONS
although complete loss of the u12-type spliceosome has occurred repeatedly, u <dig> introns are extremely stable in some taxa, including eutheria. loss of u <dig> introns or the genes containing them is more common than conversion to the u2-type. the degeneracy of u12-type terminal dinucleotides among natural u12-type introns is higher than previously thought.
