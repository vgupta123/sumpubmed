BACKGROUND
taenia solium is a zoonotic helminth with the potential to cause life threatening epilepsy in people through the aberrant larval infection of the brain called neurocysticercosis . the pig is the intermediate host for t. solium where the larval form, cysticercus cellulosae, normally develops after the pig eats eggs of the parasite. humans are the definitive host where the adult tapeworm develops and are infected through the consumption of poorly cooked, infected meat. t. solium has been acknowledged by the world health organization , food and agriculture organization  and uk department for international development  as being a neglected zoonotic disease, and was recently included in the who roadmap for control of neglected tropical diseases. this neglect encompasses a lack of epidemiological data and a lack of validated, effective control strategies being adopted. understanding the epidemiology of this parasite in the intermediate host is the first step towards designing suitable intervention strategies for the improvement of public health. this study was undertaken to provide an accurate and up-to-date estimate for the prevalence of porcine cysticercosis in the lake kyoga basin.


RESULTS
sera from  <dig> pigs were analysed with the hp <dig> antigen enzyme linked immunosorbant assay  and the prevalence was found to be  <dig> % . previous sero- surveillance in this region, using the b158/b <dig> ag elisa had indicated a prevalence of  <dig> % in  <dig> indicating a dramatic increase in prevalence  within a 6 year period.


CONCLUSIONS
this increasing prevalence in the disease indicates to us that there is currently no effective control of this parasite and that in this region of uganda at least; cysticercosis remains a neglected zoonotic disease.
