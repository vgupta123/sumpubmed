BACKGROUND
grain endosperm chalkiness of rice is a varietal characteristic that negatively affects not only the appearance and milling properties but also the cooking texture and palatability of cooked rice. however, grain chalkiness is a complex quantitative genetic trait and the molecular mechanisms underlying its formation are poorly understood.


RESULTS
a near-isogenic line cssl50- <dig> with high chalkiness was compared with its normal parental line asominori for grain endosperm chalkiness. physico-biochemical analyses of ripened grains showed that, compared with asominori, cssl50- <dig> contains higher levels of amylose and  <dig> dp  short-chain amylopectin, but lower medium length  <dig> dp amylopectin. transcriptome analysis of  <dig> daf  caryopses of the isogenic lines identified  <dig> differential expressed genes , among which  <dig> genes are up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated. these genes were classified into  <dig> major categories, with  <dig> % of them belong to six major functional groups: signal transduction, cell rescue/defense, transcription, protein degradation, carbohydrate metabolism and redox homeostasis. detailed pathway dissection demonstrated that genes involved in sucrose and starch synthesis are up-regulated, whereas those involved in non-starch polysaccharides are down regulated. several genes involved in oxidoreductive homeostasis were found to have higher expression levels in cssl50- <dig> as well, suggesting potential roles of ros in grain chalkiness formation.


CONCLUSIONS
extensive gene expression changes were detected during rice grain chalkiness formation. over half of these differentially expressed genes are implicated in several important categories of genes, including signal transduction, transcription, carbohydrate metabolism and redox homeostasis, suggesting that chalkiness formation involves multiple metabolic and regulatory pathways.
