BACKGROUND
we have previously shown that supernatant from candida albicans  culture contains a secretory interleukin - <dig> inhibitory factor , which inhibits il- <dig> production by human monocytes. however, the effect of ca-siif on secretion of other cytokines by monocytes is unknown, and detailed characterization of this factor has not been performed.


RESULTS
in this study, we demonstrate that the il- <dig> inhibitory activity of ca-siif was serum-independent, based on the reduction of il- <dig> levels in monocytes stimulated under serum-independent conditions. the minimal inhibitory dose of ca-siif was found to be  <dig> μg/ml. investigation of ca-siif's effect on macrophages il- <dig> production in vitro and in vivo also showed that ca-siif inhibited il- <dig> production by murine macrophages both in vitro  and in vivo . in addition to il- <dig>  cytokine array analysis revealed that ca-siif induced differential production of other cytokines also. in this regard, reduction in levels were observed for il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  monocyte chemoattractant protein - <dig>  mcp- <dig>  macrophage inflammatory protein - <dig>  rantes, etc. in contrast, levels of other chemokines e.g. mcp- <dig>  mif and mip-3α  were increased. we also found that ca-siif suppressed the maturation of human monocytes to dendritic cells . next, to identify the biochemical nature of ca-siif, we separated this factor into a concanavalin a -binding glycoprotein fraction  and a non-cona-binding protein fraction  using cona affinity chromatography. both fractions were then tested for this inhibitory effect on human monocyte il- <dig> production. ca-siif-gp produced a higher inhibitory effect on il- <dig> production compared to ca-siif-ngp and ca-siif crude , proving that ca-siif is a glycoprotein in nature.


CONCLUSIONS
ca-siif is a glycoprotein which exhibits serum-independent inhibition of il- <dig> production from monocytes in vitro and in vivo, and also modulates differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells. these results suggest important role for ca-siif in interactions of c. albicans with the host immune system.
