BACKGROUND
high density genetic maps built with snp markers that are polymorphic in various genetic backgrounds are very useful for studying the genetics of agronomical traits as well as genome organization and evolution. simultaneous dense snp genotyping of segregating populations and variety collections was applied to oilseed rape  to obtain a high density genetic map for this species and to study the linkage disequilibrium pattern.


RESULTS
we developed an integrated genetic map for oilseed rape by high throughput snp genotyping of four segregating doubled haploid populations. a very high level of collinearity was observed between the four individual maps and a large number of markers  was common to more than two maps. the precise integrated map comprises  <dig> snp and  <dig> pcr markers. with a total genetic length of 2250 cm, the integrated map contains a density of  <dig>  markers  per cm. genotyping of these mapped snp markers in oilseed rape collections allowed polymorphism level and linkage disequilibrium  to be studied across the different collections  and along the linkage groups. overall, polymorphism level was higher and ld decayed faster in spring than in “00” winter oilseed rape types but this was shown to vary greatly along the linkage groups.


CONCLUSIONS
our study provides a valuable resource for further genetic studies using linkage or association mapping, for marker assisted breeding and for brassica napus sequence assembly and genome organization analyses.
