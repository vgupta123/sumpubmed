BACKGROUND
tanzania has a high tuberculosis incidence, and genotyping studies of mycobacterium tuberculosis in the country are necessary in order to improve our understanding of the epidemic. spoligotyping is a potentially powerful genotyping method due to fast generation of genotyping results, high reproducibility and low operation costs. the recently constructed spoldb <dig> database and the model-based program 'spotclust' can be used to assign isolates to families, subfamilies and variants. the results of a study can thus be analyzed in a global context.


RESULTS
one hundred forty-seven pulmonary isolates from consecutive tuberculosis patients in dar es salaam were spoligotyped. spoldb <dig> and 'spotclust' were used to assign isolates to families, subfamilies and variants. the cas , lam  and eai  families were the most abundant. despite the dominance of these three families, diversity was high due to variation within m. tuberculosis families. of the obtained spoligopatterns, 64% were previously unrecorded.


CONCLUSIONS
spoligotyping is useful to gain an overall understanding of the local tb epidemic. this study demonstrates that the extensive tb epidemic in dar es salaam, tanzania is caused by a few successful m. tuberculosis families, dominated by the cas family. import of strains was a minor problem.
