BACKGROUND
roberts syndrome  is a human developmental disorder caused by mutations in the cohesin acetyltransferase esco <dig>  we previously reported that mtorc <dig> signaling was depressed and overall translation was reduced in rbs cells and zebrafish models for rbs. treatment of rbs cells and zebrafish rbs models with l-leucine partially rescued mtor function and protein synthesis, correlating with increased cell division and improved development.


RESULTS
in this study, we use rbs cells to model mtorc <dig> repression and analyze transcription and translation with ribosome profiling to determine gene-level effects of l-leucine. l-leucine treatment partially rescued translational efficiency of ribosomal subunits, translation initiation factors, snorna production, and mitochondrial function in rbs cells, consistent with these processes being mtorc <dig> controlled. in contrast, other genes are differentially expressed independent of l-leucine treatment, including imprinted genes such as h <dig> and gtl <dig>  mirnas regulated by gtl <dig>  hox genes, and genes in nucleolar associated domains.


CONCLUSIONS
our study distinguishes between gene expression changes in rbs cells that are tor dependent and those that are independent. some of the tor independent gene expression changes likely reflect the architectural role of cohesin in chromatin looping and gene expression. this study reveals the dramatic rescue effects of l-leucine stimulation of mtorc <dig> in rbs cells and supports that normal gene expression and translation requires esco <dig> function.
