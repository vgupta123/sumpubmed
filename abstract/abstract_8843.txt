BACKGROUND
differential rna-sequencing  is indispensable for determination of primary transcriptomes. however, using drna-seq data to map transcriptional start sites  and promoters genome-wide is a bioinformatics challenge. we performed drna-seq of bradyrhizobium japonicum usda  <dig>  the nitrogen-fixing symbiont of soybean, and developed algorithms to map tsss and promoters.


RESULTS
a specialized machine learning procedure for tss recognition allowed us to map  <dig>  tsss:  <dig>  in free-living bacteria,  <dig> in symbiosis with soybean and  <dig> in both conditions. further, we provide proteomic evidence for  <dig> proteins, among them  <dig> proteins corresponding to new genes and  <dig> proteins with n-termini different from the existing annotation . guided by proteomics evidence, previously identified tsss and tsss experimentally validated here, we assign a score threshold to flag 14 % of the mapped tsss as a class of lower confidence. however, this class of lower confidence contains valid tsss of low-abundant transcripts. moreover, we developed a de novo algorithm to identify promoter motifs upstream of mapped tsss, which is publicly available, and found motifs mainly used in symbiosis  or under both conditions . mapped tsss and putative promoters, proteomic evidence and updated gene annotation were combined into an annotation file.


CONCLUSIONS
the genome-wide tss and promoter maps along with the extended genome annotation of b. japonicum represent a valuable resource for future systems biology studies and for detailed analyses of individual non-coding transcripts and orfs. our data will also provide new insights into bacterial gene regulation during the agriculturally important symbiosis between rhizobia and legumes.
