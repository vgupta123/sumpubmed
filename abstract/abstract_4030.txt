BACKGROUND
the avrk <dig> and avra <dig> avirulence  genes encode effectors that increase the pathogenicity of the fungus blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei , the powdery mildew pathogen, in susceptible barley plants. in resistant barley, mlk <dig> and mla <dig> resistance proteins recognize the presence of avrk <dig> and avra <dig>  eliciting the hypersensitive response typical of gene for gene interactions. avrk <dig> and avra <dig> have more than  <dig> homologues in bgh genome, forming the eka  gene family.


RESULTS
we tested the hypothesis that the eka family originated from degenerate copies of class i line retrotransposons by analysing the eka family in the genome of bgh isolate dh <dig> with bioinformatic tools specially developed for the analysis of transposable elements  in genomes. the class i line retrotransposon copies homologous to avrk <dig> and avra <dig> represent  <dig>  % of the bgh annotated genome and, among them, we identified  <dig> avr/effector candidate genes. we also experimentally identified peptides that indicated the translation of several predicted proteins from eka family members, which had higher relative abundance in haustoria than in hyphae.


CONCLUSIONS
our analyses indicate that avrk <dig> and avra <dig> have evolved from part of the orf <dig> gene of class i line retrotransposons. the co-option of avra <dig> and avrk <dig> as effectors from truncated copies of retrotransposons explains the huge number of homologues in bgh genome that could act as dynamic reservoirs from which new effector genes may evolve. these data provide further evidence for recruitment of retrotransposons in the evolution of new biological functions.
