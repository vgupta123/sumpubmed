BACKGROUND
nogo-a, a myelin-associated protein, inhibits neurite outgrowth and abates regeneration in the adult vertebrate central nervous system  and may play a role in maintaining neural pathways once established. however, the presence of nogo-a during early cns development is counterintuitive and hints at an additional role for nogo-a beyond neurite inhibition.


RESULTS
we isolated chicken nogo-a and determined its sequence. a multiple alignment of the amino acid sequence across divergent species, identified five previously undescribed, nogo-a specific conserved regions that may be relevant for development. nogo gene transcripts  were differentially expressed in the cns during development and a second nogo-a splice variant was identified. we further localized nogo-a expression during key phases of cns development by in situ hybridization. cns-associated nogo-a was induced coincident with neural plate formation and up-regulated by fgf in the transformation of non-neural ectoderm into neural precursors. nogo-a expression was diffuse in the neuroectoderm during the early proliferative phase of development, and migration, but localized to large projection neurons of the optic tectum and tectal-associated nuclei during architectural differentiation, lamination and network establishment.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest nogo-a plays a functional role in the determination of neural identity and/or differentiation and also appears to play a later role in the networking of large projection neurons during neurite formation and synaptogenesis. these data indicate that nogo-a is a multifunctional protein with additional roles during cns development that are disparate from its later role of neurite outgrowth inhibition in the adult cns.
