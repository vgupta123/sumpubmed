BACKGROUND
with the increased use of ploidy manipulation in aquaculture and fisheries management this investigation aimed to determine whether triploidy influences culturable intestinal microbiota composition and bacterial drug resistance in atlantic salmon . the results could provide answers to some of the physiological differences observed between triploid and diploid fish, especially in terms of fish health.


RESULTS
no ploidy effect was observed in the bacterial species isolated, however, triploids were found to contain a significant increase in total gut microbiota levels, with increases in pseudomonas spp., pectobacterium carotovorum, psychrobacter spp., bacillus spp., and vibrio spp., , whereas a decrease in carnobacterium spp., within triploids compared to diploids was close to significant . with the exception of gentamicin, where no bacterial resistance was observed, bacterial isolates originating from triploid hosts displayed increased resistance to antibacterials, three of which were significant .


CONCLUSIONS
results indicate that triploidy influences both the community and drug resistance of culturable intestinal microbiota in juvenile salmon. these results demonstrate differences that are likely to contribute to the health of triploid fish and have important ramifications on the use of antibacterial drugs within aquaculture.
