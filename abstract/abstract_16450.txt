BACKGROUND
mammalian sirtuins are homologs to the yeast silent information regulator  <dig> , which is an nad-dependent deacetylase. sirtuins are comprised of  <dig> proteins, and each has different target proteins. sirtuin  <dig>  plays important roles in maintaining metabolic functions and immune responses, and sirt <dig> protects cells from oxidative stress-induced cell death. both sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> are regulated by metabolic status and aging. hence, sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> have been researched in metabolic diseases, such as type  <dig> diabetes mellitus , fatty liver, and heart diseases. although these diseases have been increasing, there is little information about relation between the diseases and sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> in cats. therefore we cloned sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> cdna, examined mrna expression in cat tissues, and investigated the changes in sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> mrna expression in peripheral blood leukocyte of cats fed on hfd for 6Â weeks.


RESULTS
cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> contained a catalytic core region and showed high sequence homology with other vertebrate sirt <dig>  and sirt <dig>  amino acids. real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that high expression levels were observed in the liver and skeletal muscle for sirt <dig> and in the heart for sirt <dig> in cats. in addition, both cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> expression levels in the pancreas were different between individuals. cat sirt <dig> mrna expression in peripheral blood leukocytes was significantly elevated in obese cats fed on hfd .


CONCLUSIONS
cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> genes are highly conserved among vertebrates, and hfd feeding may be related to sirt <dig> mrna expression mechanisms in cat peripheral blood leukocytes.
