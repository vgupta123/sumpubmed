BACKGROUND
like other structural variants, transposable element insertions can be highly polymorphic across individuals. their functional impact, however, remains poorly understood. current genome-wide approaches for genotyping insertion-site polymorphisms based on targeted or whole-genome sequencing remain very expensive and can lack accuracy, hence new large-scale genotyping methods are needed.


RESULTS
we describe a high-throughput method for genotyping transposable element insertions and other types of structural variants that can be assayed by breakpoint pcr. the method relies on next-generation sequencing of multiplex, site-specific pcr amplification products and read count-based genotype calls. we show that this method is flexible, efficient , cost-effective and highly accurate.


CONCLUSIONS
this method can benefit a wide range of applications from the routine genotyping of animal and plant populations to the functional study of structural variants in humans.
