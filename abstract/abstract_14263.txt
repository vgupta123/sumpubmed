BACKGROUND
members of the united states armed forces receive a series of vaccinations during their course of service. to investigate the influence of multiple vaccinations on innate immunity, we measured concentrations of a panel of immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum samples from a group of such individuals.


RESULTS
significantly increased levels of macrophage inflammatory protein 1α , mip-1β and interleukin  <dig>  were detected. since these cytokines are known to have anti-human immunodeficiency virus  activity, we tested the effect of serum from these individuals on hiv- <dig> infectivity and susceptibility of their peripheral blood mononuclear cells  to hiv- <dig> infection in vitro. sera from vaccinated military personnel inhibited, and their pbmcs were partially resistant to, infection by hiv- <dig> strains tropic to ccr <dig> , but not to cxcr <dig> , chemokine receptor.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings demonstrate that increased anti-hiv chemokines can be detected in vaccine recipients up to  <dig> weeks following immunization.
