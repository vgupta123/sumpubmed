BACKGROUND
trimeric intracellular cation  channels are crucial for ca2+ handling in eukaryotes and are involved in k+ uptake in prokaryotes. recent studies on the representative members of eukaryotic and prokaryotic tric channels demonstrated that they form homotrimeric units with the ion-conducting pores contained within each individual monomer.


RESULTS
here we report detailed insights into the ion- and water-binding sites inside the pore of a tric channel from sulfolobus solfataricus . like the mammalian tric channels, sstric is permeable to both k+ and na+ with a slight preference for k+, and is nearly impermeable to ca2+, mg2+, or cl–. in the  <dig> -Å resolution k+-bound structure of sstric, ion/water densities have been well resolved inside the pore. at the central region, a filter-like structure is shaped by the kinks on the second and fifth transmembrane helices and two nearby phenylalanine residues. below the filter, the cytoplasmic vestibule is occluded by a plug-like motif attached to an array of pore-lining charged residues.


CONCLUSIONS
the asymmetric filter-like structure at the pore center of sstric might serve as the basis for the channel to bind and select monovalent cations. a velcro-like plug-pore interacting model has been proposed and suggests a unified framework accounting for the gating mechanisms of prokaryotic and eukaryotic tric channels.
