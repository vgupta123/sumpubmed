BACKGROUND
colobine monkeys constitute a diverse group of primates with major radiations in africa and asia. however, phylogenetic relationships among genera are under debate, and recent molecular studies with incomplete taxon-sampling revealed discordant gene trees. to solve the evolutionary history of colobine genera and to determine causes for possible gene tree incongruences, we combined presence/absence analysis of mobile elements with autosomal, x chromosomal, y chromosomal and mitochondrial sequence data from all recognized colobine genera.


RESULTS
gene tree topologies and divergence age estimates derived from different markers were similar, but differed in placing piliocolobus/procolobus and langur genera among colobines. although insufficient data, homoplasy and incomplete lineage sorting might all have contributed to the discordance among gene trees, hybridization is favored as the main cause of the observed discordance. we propose that african colobines are paraphyletic, but might later have experienced female introgression from piliocolobus/procolobus into colobus. in the late miocene, colobines invaded eurasia and diversified into several lineages. among asian colobines, semnopithecus diverged first, indicating langur paraphyly. however, unidirectional gene flow from semnopithecus into trachypithecus via male introgression followed by nuclear swamping might have occurred until the earliest pleistocene.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, our study provides the most comprehensive view on colobine evolution to date and emphasizes that analyses of various molecular markers, such as mobile elements and sequence data from multiple loci, are crucial to better understand evolutionary relationships and to trace hybridization events. our results also suggest that sex-specific dispersal patterns, promoted by a respective social organization of the species involved, can result in different hybridization scenarios.
