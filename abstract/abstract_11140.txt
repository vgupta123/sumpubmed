BACKGROUND
the transcriptome of the fruit pulp of the sweet orange variety anliu  and that of its red fleshed mutant hong anliu  were compared to understand the dynamics and differential expression of genes expressed during fruit development and ripening.


RESULTS
the transcriptomes of wt and mt were sampled at four developmental stages using an illumina sequencing platform. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were detected in mt and wt, respectively. hierarchical clustering analysis revealed  <dig> expression patterns for the set of all genes detected, of which  <dig> were in common between mt and wt. over 89% of the genes showed differential expression during fruit development and ripening in the wt. functional categorization of the differentially expressed genes revealed that cell wall biosynthesis, carbohydrate and citric acid metabolism, carotenoid metabolism, and the response to stress were the most differentially regulated processes occurring during fruit development and ripening.


CONCLUSIONS
a description of the transcriptomic changes occurring during fruit development and ripening was obtained in sweet orange, along with a dynamic view of the gene expression differences between the wild type and a red fleshed mutant.
