BACKGROUND
molecular studies of appendage regeneration have been hindered by the lack of a stable and efficient means of transferring exogenous genes. we therefore sought an efficient integrating virus system that could be used to study limb and tail regeneration in salamanders.


RESULTS
we show that replication-deficient foamy virus  vectors efficiently transduce cells in two different regeneration models in cell culture and in vivo. injection of egfp-expressing fv but not lentivirus vector particles into regenerating limbs and tail resulted in widespread expression that persisted throughout regeneration and reamputation pointing to the utility of fv for analyzing adult phenotypes in non-mammalian models. furthermore, tissue specific transgene expression is achieved using fv vectors during limb regeneration.


CONCLUSIONS
fv vectors are efficient mean of transferring genes into axolotl limb/tail and infection persists throughout regeneration and reamputation. this is a nontoxic method of delivering genes into axolotls in vivo/ in vitro and can potentially be applied to other salamander species.
