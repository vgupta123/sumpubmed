BACKGROUND
streptococcus agalactiae, also referred to as group b streptococcus , is a frequent resident of the rectovaginal tract in humans, and a major cause of neonatal infection. in addition, s. agalactiae is a known fish pathogen, which compromises food safety and represents a zoonotic hazard. the complete genome sequence of the piscine s. agalactiae isolate gd201008- <dig> was compared with  <dig> other piscine, human and bovine strains to explore their virulence determinants, evolutionary relationships and the genetic basis of host tropism in s. agalactiae.


RESULTS
the pan-genome of s. agalactiae is open and its size increases with the addition of newly sequenced genomes. the core genes shared by all isolates account for 50 ~ 70% of any single genome. the chinese piscine isolates gd201008- <dig> and zq <dig> are phylogenetically distinct from the latin american piscine isolates sa20- <dig> and stir-cd- <dig>  but are closely related to the human strain a <dig>  in the context of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats , prophage, virulence-associated genes and phylogenetic relationships. we identified a unique 10 kb gene locus in chinese piscine strains.


CONCLUSIONS
isolates from cultured tilapia in china have a close genomic relationship with the human strain a <dig>  our findings provide insight into the pathogenesis and host-associated genome content of piscine s. agalactiae isolated in china.
