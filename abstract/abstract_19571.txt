BACKGROUND
neurite outgrowth is a key process during neuronal migration and differentiation. complex intracellular signaling is involved in the initiation of neurite protrusion and subsequent elongation. although, in general many constituents of the machinery involved in this multi-stage process are common for neurons in distinct brain areas, there are notable differences between specific neuronal subtypes.


RESULTS
we analyzed key intracellular components of neurite outgrowth signaling in postnatally born subventricular zone  neurons in vitro. we showed that inhibitors of pi3k, akt <dig>  pkcζ and small gtpases significantly reduced neurite outgrowth. transfection of svz-derived neurons with inactive forms of rac <dig> or cdc <dig> also decreased neurite length whereas transfection with constitutively active forms of rac <dig>  cdc <dig> or akt <dig> as well as with full-length pi3k or pkcζ increased neurite length. pi3k, akt <dig> and pkcζ acted upstream of the small gtpases rac <dig> and cdc <dig>  which in turn modulate lamellipodia formation of svz-derived neurons.


CONCLUSIONS
we showed the involvement of pi3k/akt1/pkcζ/rac1/cdc <dig> pathway in neurite outgrowth of postnatally born svz neurons.
