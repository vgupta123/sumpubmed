BACKGROUND
multiple tick saliva proteins, the majority of which are unknown, confer tick resistance in repeatedly infested animals. the objective of this study was to identify the 24-48 h fed amblyomma americanum tick saliva immuno-proteome. the 24-48 h tick-feeding phase is critical to tick parasitism as it precedes important events in tick biology, blood meal feeding and disease agent transmission. fed male,  <dig> and 96 h fed female phage display cdna expression libraries were biopanned using rabbit antibodies to  <dig> and 48 h fed a. americanum female tick saliva proteins. biopanned immuno-cdna libraries were subjected to next generation sequencing, de novo assembly, and bioinformatic analysis.


RESULTS
more than  <dig> transcripts that code for 24-48 h fed a. americanum immuno-proteins are described. of the  <dig> immuno-proteins, 52%  were provisionally identified based on matches in genbank. of these, ~19%  show high level of identity to other tick hypothetical proteins, and the rest include putative proteases , protease inhibitors , and transporters and/or ligand binding proteins . others include enzymes , ribosomal proteins, and those of miscellaneous functions .


CONCLUSIONS
data here demonstrate that a. americanum secretes a complex cocktail of immunogenic tick saliva proteins during the first 24-48 h of feeding. of significance, previously validated immunogenic tick saliva proteins including av <dig> protein, calreticulin, histamine release factor, histamine binding/lipocalins, selenoproteins, and paramyosin were identified in this screen, supporting the specificity of the approach in this study. while descriptive, this study opens opportunities for in-depth tick feeding physiology studies.
