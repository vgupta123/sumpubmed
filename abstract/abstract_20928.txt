BACKGROUND
parkinson’s disease is characterized by a continuous loss of neurons within the substantia nigra  leading to a depletion of dopamine. within the adult sn as a non-neurogenic region, cells with mainly oligodendrocytic precursor characteristics, expressing the neuro-glial antigen- <dig>  are continuously generated. proliferation of these cells is altered in animal models of parkinson’s disease . exercise and environmental enrichment re-increase proliferation of ng2+ cells in pd models, however, a possible mechanistic role of dopamine for this increase is not completely understood. ng2+ cells can differentiate into oligodendrocytes but also into microglia and neurons as observed in vitro suggesting a possible hint for endogenous regenerative capacity of the sn. we investigated the role of dopamine in ng2-generation and differentiation in the adult sn stimulated by physical activity and environmental enrichment.


RESULTS
we used the 1-methyl-4-phenyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydropyridine -model for dopamine depletion and analysed newborn cells in the sn at different maturation stages and time points depending on voluntary physical activity, enriched environment and levodopa-treatment. we describe an activity- induced increase of new ng2-positive cells and also mature oligodendrocytes in the sn of healthy mice. running and enriched environment refused to stimulate ng2-generation and oligodendrogenesis in mptp-mice, an effect which could be reversed by pharmacological levodopa-induced rescue.


CONCLUSIONS
we suggest dopamine being a key regulator for activity-induced generation of ng2-cells and oliogodendrocytes in the sn as a potentially relevant mechanism in endogenous nigral cellular plasticity.
