BACKGROUND
dormancy of buds is a critical developmental process that allows perennial plants to survive extreme seasonal variations in climate. dormancy transitions in underground crown buds of the model herbaceous perennial weed leafy spurge were investigated using a  <dig> k element cdna microarray. these data represent the first large-scale transcriptome analysis of dormancy in underground buds of an herbaceous perennial species. crown buds collected monthly from august through december, over a five year period, were used to monitor the changes in the transcriptome during dormancy transitions.


RESULTS
nearly  <dig>  genes were differentially-expressed through seasonal dormancy transitions. expected patterns of gene expression were observed for previously characterized genes and physiological processes indicated that resolution in our analysis was sufficient for identifying shifts in global gene expression.


CONCLUSIONS
gene ontology of differentially-expressed genes suggests dormancy transitions require specific alterations in transport functions , ethylene, jasmonic acid, auxin, gibberellic acid, and abscisic acid responses, and responses to stress . comparison to other dormancy microarray studies indicated that nearly half of the genes identified in our study were also differentially expressed in at least two other plant species during dormancy transitions. this comparison allowed us to identify a particular mads-box transcription factor related to the dormancy associated mads-box genes from peach and hypothesize that it may play a direct role in dormancy induction and maintenance through regulation of flowering locus t.
