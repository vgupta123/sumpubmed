BACKGROUND
veterinary drugs such as clenbuterol  and sulfamethazine  are low molecular weight  compounds, or haptens, that are difficult to develop immunoassays due to their low immunogenicity. in this study, we conjugated the drugs to ovalbumin to increase their immunogenicity for antiserum production in rabbits and developed a protein microarray immunoassay for detection of clenbuterol and sulfamethazine. the sensitivity of this approach was then compared to traditional elisa technique.


RESULTS
the artificial antigens were spotted on microarray slides. standard concentrations of the compounds were added to compete with the spotted antigens for binding to the antisera to determine the ic <dig>  our microarray assay showed the ic <dig> were  <dig>  ng/ml for cl and  <dig>  ng/ml for sm <dig>  while the traditional competitive indirect-elisa  showed the ic <dig> were  <dig>  ng/ml for cl and  <dig>  ng/ml for sm <dig>  we further validated the two methods with cl fortified chicken muscle tissues, and the protein microarray assay showed 90% recovery while the ci-elisa had 76% recovery rate. when tested with cl-fed chicken muscle tissues, the protein microarray assay had higher sensitivity  than the ci-elisa  for detection of cl residues.


CONCLUSIONS
the protein microarrays showed  <dig>  and  <dig>  times lower ic <dig> than the ci-elisa detection for cl and sm <dig>  respectively, suggesting that immunodetection of small molecules with protein microarray is a better approach than the traditional elisa technique.
