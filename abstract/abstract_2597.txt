BACKGROUND
studies conducted on mycobacterium spp. isolated from human patients indicate that sequencing of a  <dig> bp portion of the rpob gene can be useful in assigning a species identity, particularly for members of the mycobacterium avium complex . given that mac are important pathogens in livestock, companion animals, and zoo/exotic animals, we were interested in evaluating the use of rpob sequencing for identification of mycobacterium isolates of veterinary origin.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> isolates, collected over  <dig> - june  <dig> from  <dig> animals  underwent pcr and sequencing of a ~  <dig> bp portion of the rpob gene;  <dig> isolates  were identified to the species level based on similarity at â‰¥ 98% with a reference sequence. the remaining  <dig> isolates  displayed < 98% similarity with reference sequences and were assigned to a clade based on their location in a neighbor-joining tree containing reference sequences. for a subset of  <dig> isolates that received both 16s rrna and rpob sequencing,  <dig>  displayed a similar species/clade assignation for both sequencing methods. for the remaining  <dig> isolates, species/clade identities were different with each sequencing method. mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis was the species most frequently isolated from specimens from pigs, cervids, companion animals, cattle, and exotic/zoo animals.


CONCLUSIONS
rpob sequencing proved useful in identifying mycobacterium isolates of veterinary origin to clade, species, or subspecies levels, particularly for assemblages  where 16s rrna sequencing alone is not adequate to demarcate these taxa. rpob sequencing can represent a cost-effective identification tool suitable for routine use in the veterinary diagnostic laboratory.
