BACKGROUND
most cellular proteins function as part of stable protein complexes. we recently showed that around 38% of proteins associate with mrnas that encode interacting proteins, reflecting the cotranslational formation of the complex between the bait protein and the nascent peptides encoded by the interacting mrnas. here we hypothesise that these cotranslational protein-mrna associations can be used to predict protein-protein interactions.


RESULTS
we found that the fission yeast exo <dig> protein, which encodes an exonuclease of the xrn <dig> family, coimmunoprecipitates with the eti <dig> mrna, which codes for a protein of unknown function and uninformative sequence. based on this protein-mrna association, we predicted that the exo <dig> and eti <dig> protein are part of the same complex, and confirmed this hypothesis by coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization of the proteins. similarly, we show that the cotranslational interaction between the sty <dig> map kinase and the cip <dig> mrna, which encodes an rna-binding protein, predicts a complex between sty <dig> and cip <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that cotranslational protein-mrna associations can be used to identify new components of protein complexes.
