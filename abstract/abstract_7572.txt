BACKGROUND
sugarcane  has become an increasingly important crop for its leading role in biofuel production. the high sugar content species s. officinarum is an octoploid without known diploid or tetraploid progenitors. commercial sugarcane cultivars are hybrids between s. officinarum and wild species s. spontaneum with ploidy at ~12Ã—. the complex autopolyploid sugarcane genome has not been characterized at the dna sequence level.


RESULTS
the microsynteny between sugarcane and sorghum was assessed by comparing  <dig> pyrosequences of  <dig> sugarcane bacterial artificial chromosomes  with sorghum sequences. these  <dig> bacs were selected by hybridization of  <dig> single copy sorghum overgo probes to the sugarcane bac library with one sugarcane bac corresponding to each of the  <dig> sorghum chromosome arms. the genic regions of the sugarcane bacs shared an average of  <dig> % sequence identity with sorghum, and the sorghum genome was used as a template to order sequence contigs covering  <dig> % of the  <dig> bac sequences. about  <dig> % of the sugarcane bac sequences are aligned with sorghum sequence. the unaligned regions contain non-coding and repetitive sequences. within the aligned sequences,  <dig> genes were annotated in sugarcane and  <dig> in sorghum. seventeen genes appeared to be sugarcane-specific and all validated by sugarcane ests, while  <dig> appeared sorghum-specific but only one validated by sorghum ests. twelve of the  <dig> sugarcane-specific genes have no match in the non-redundant protein database in genbank, perhaps encoding proteins for sugarcane-specific processes. the sorghum orthologous regions appeared to have expanded relative to sugarcane, mostly by the increase of retrotransposons.


CONCLUSIONS
the sugarcane and sorghum genomes are mostly collinear in the genic regions, and the sorghum genome can be used as a template for assembling much of the genic dna of the autopolyploid sugarcane genome. the comparable gene density between sugarcane bacs and corresponding sorghum sequences defied the notion that polyploidy species might have faster pace of gene loss due to the redundancy of multiple alleles at each locus.
