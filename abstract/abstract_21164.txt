BACKGROUND
differential gene expression  analysis is a technique to identify statistically significant differences in rna abundance for genes or arbitrary features between different biological states. the result of a dge test is typically further analyzed using statistical software, spreadsheets or custom ad hoc algorithms. we identified a need for a web-based system to share dge statistical test results, and locate and identify genes in dge statistical test results with a very low barrier of entry.


RESULTS
we have developed deiva, a free and open source, browser-based single page application  with a strong emphasis on being user friendly that enables locating and identifying single or multiple genes in an immediate, interactive, and intuitive manner. by design, deiva scales with very large numbers of users and datasets.


CONCLUSIONS
compared to existing software, deiva offers a unique combination of design decisions that enable inspection and analysis of dge statistical test results with an emphasis on ease of use.
