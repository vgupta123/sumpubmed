BACKGROUND
streptococcus suis serotype  <dig>  is an important pathogen of pigs. s suis  <dig> infections have high mortality rates and are characterized by meningitis, septicemia and pneumonia. s. suis  <dig> is also an emerging zoonotic agent and can infect humans that are exposed to pigs or their by-products. to increase our knowledge of the pathogenesis of meningitis, septicemia and pneumonia in pigs caused by s. suis  <dig>  we profiled the response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells , brain and lung tissues to infection with s. suis  <dig> strain sc <dig> using the affymetrix porcine genome array.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  differentially expressed transcripts were identified in the three tissues, including  <dig> unique genes in brain,  <dig> in lung and  <dig> in pbmc. these genes showed differential expression  patterns on analysis by visualization and integrated discovery . the de genes involved in the immune response included genes related to the inflammatory response , the innate immune response , cell adhesion , antigen processing and presentation  and angiogenesis , together with genes encoding cytokines . five selected genes were validated by qrt-pcr analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
we studied the response to infection with s. suis  <dig> strain sc <dig> by microarray analysis. our findings confirmed some genes identified in previous studies and discovered numerous additional genes that potentially function in s. suis  <dig> infections in vivo. this new information will form the foundation of future investigations into the pathogenesis of s. suis.
