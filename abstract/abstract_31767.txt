BACKGROUND
prediction of bacterial virulent protein sequences has implications for identification and characterization of novel virulence-associated factors, finding novel drug/vaccine targets against proteins indispensable to pathogenicity, and understanding the complex virulence mechanism in pathogens.


RESULTS
in the present study we propose a bacterial virulent protein prediction method based on bi-layer cascade support vector machine . the first layer svm classifiers were trained and optimized with different individual protein sequence features like amino acid composition, dipeptide composition , higher order dipeptide composition  and position specific iterated blast  generated position specific scoring matrices . in addition, a similarity-search based module was also developed using a dataset of virulent and non-virulent proteins as blast database. a five-fold cross-validation technique was used for the evaluation of various prediction strategies in this study. the results from the first layer  were cascaded to the second layer svm classifier to train and generate the final classifier. the cascade svm classifier was able to accomplish an accuracy of  <dig> %, covering 86% area in the receiver operator characteristic  plot, better than that of either of the layer one svm classifiers based on single or multiple sequence features.


CONCLUSIONS
virulentpred is a svm based method to predict bacterial virulent proteins sequences, which can be used to screen virulent proteins in proteomes. together with experimentally verified virulent proteins, several putative, non annotated and hypothetical protein sequences have been predicted to be high scoring virulent proteins by the prediction method. virulentpred is available as a freely accessible world wide web server â€“ virulentpred, at http://bioinfo.icgeb.res.in/virulent/.
