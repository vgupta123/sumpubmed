BACKGROUND
the phenomenon of misdiagnosing tuberculosis  by laboratory cross-contamination when culturing mycobacterium tuberculosis  has been widely reported and it has an obvious clinical, therapeutic and social impact. the final confirmation of a cross-contamination event requires the molecular identification of the same mtb strain cultured from both the potential source of the contamination and from the false-positive candidate. the molecular tool usually applied in this context is is6110-rflp which takes a long time to provide an answer, usually longer than is acceptable for microbiologists and clinicians to make decisions. our purpose in this study is to evaluate a novel pcr-based method, miru-vntr as an alternative to assure a rapid and optimized analysis of cross-contamination alerts.


RESULTS
miru-vntr was prospectively compared with is6110-rflp for clarifying  <dig> alerts of false positivity from other laboratories. miru-vntr highly correlated with is6110-rflp, reduced the response time by  <dig> days and clarified six alerts unresolved by rflp. additionally, miru-vntr revealed complex situations such as contamination events involving polyclonal isolates and a false-positive case due to the simultaneous cross-contamination from two independent sources.


CONCLUSIONS
unlike standard rflp-based genotyping, miru-vntr i) could help reduce the impact of a false positive diagnosis of tb, ii) increased the number of events that could be solved and iii) revealed the complexity of some cross-contamination events that could not be dissected by is6110-rflp.
