BACKGROUND
classical strains of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  predominantly cause a self-limiting diarrheal illness in humans and a systemic disease in mice. in this study, we report the characterization of a strain isolated from a blood-culture taken from a 15-year old woman suffering from invasive severe salmonellosis, refractory to conventional therapy with extended-spectrum cephalosporin .


RESULTS
the strain, named  <dig>  was characterized as multidrug-resistant salmonella serogroup a by biochemical, antimicrobial and serological tests. multilocus sequence typing  and xbai macrorestrictions  showed that strain  <dig> belonged to the typhimurium st <dig> genotype, previously described for other mexican typhimurium strains. pcr analyses revealed the presence of inca/c, incfiia and cole1-like plasmids and the absence of the salmonella virulence plasmid . conjugation assays showed that the esc-resistance gene blacmy- <dig> was carried on the conjugative incf plasmid, instead of the inca/c plasmid, as found in previously studied st <dig> strains. although the inca/c plasmid conferred most of the observed antimicrobial resistances it was not self-conjugative; it was rather able to conjugate by co-integrating with the incf plasmid. strain  <dig> was fully attenuated for virulence in balb/c mice infections. both type-three secretion system , encoded in salmonella pathogenicity islands  <dig> and  <dig> , were functional in the  <dig> strain and, interestingly, this strain produced the h <dig> fljb flagellin instead of the h <dig> flic flagellin commonly expressed by s. enterica strains.


CONCLUSIONS
strain  <dig> showed two main features that differentiate it from the originally described st <dig> strains: 1) the blacmy- <dig> gene was not carried on the inca/c plasmid, but on a conjugative incf plasmid, which may open a new route of dissemination for this esc-resistance gene, and 2) it expresses the h <dig> fljb flagella, in contrast with the other st <dig> and most typhimurium reference strains. to our knowledge this is the first report of an incf blacmy-2-carrying plasmid in salmonella.
