BACKGROUND
mcpip is a novel ccch zinc finger protein described as an rnase engaged in the regulation of immune responses. the regulation of expression of the gene coding for mcpip - zc3h12a is poorly explored.


RESULTS
here we report that the proinflammatory cytokine il-1β rapidly induces the synthesis of mcpip in primary monocyte-derived macrophages and hepg <dig> cells. this up-regulation takes place through the map kinase pathway and following activation of the transcription factor elk- <dig>  using a zc3h12a reporter construct we have shown that a zc3h12a promoter region, stretching from - <dig> to + <dig>  mediates activation by il-1β. this region contains binding sites for elk- <dig> and its partner srf. chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirms in vivo binding of both transcription factors to this region of the zc3h12a promoter.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the transcription factor elk- <dig> plays an important role in the activation of zc3h12a expression in response to il-1β stimulation.
