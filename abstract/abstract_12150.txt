BACKGROUND
abscisic acid  can regulate the expressions of many stress-responsive genes in plants. however, in defense responses to pathogens, mounting evidence suggests that aba plays variable roles. little information exists about genome-wide gene expression in aba responses in tomato , a model fruit crop plant.


RESULTS
global transcriptome profiles of tomato leaf responses to exogenous aba were generated using illumina rna-sequencing. more than  <dig> million base pair reads were mapped onto the tomato reference genome and the expression pattern differences between treated and control leaves were assessed. in total,  <dig>  transcripts were generated. among them,  <dig>  were functionally annotated in the ncbi non-redundant database and  <dig>  in the tomato genome reference. additionally,  <dig>  transcripts were categorized into  <dig> functional groups based on gene ontology terms, and  <dig>  were assigned to  <dig> kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathways. in both the aba treatment and control samples,  <dig>  transcripts were available to analyze their expressions, of which  <dig>   responded to exogenous aba. of these transcripts,  <dig>  were significantly differently expressed genes . many known and novel aba-induced and -repressed genes were found. exogenous aba can influence the aba signaling pathway with pyr/pyl/rcars-pp2cs-snrk2s as the center. eighteen pyl genes were detected. a large number of genes related to various transcription factors, heat shock proteins, pathogen resistance, and the salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene signaling pathways were up-regulated by exogenous aba.


CONCLUSIONS
the results indicated that aba has the potential to improve pathogen-resistance and abiotic stress tolerance in tomato. this study presents the global expression analysis of aba-regulated transcripts in tomato and provides a robust database for investigating the functions of genes induced by aba.
