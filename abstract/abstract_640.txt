BACKGROUND
sorghum belongs to the tribe of the andropogoneae that includes potential biofuel crops like switchgrass, miscanthus and successful biofuel crops like corn and sugarcane. however, from a genomics point of view sorghum has compared to these other species a simpler genome because it lacks the additional rounds of whole genome duplication events. therefore, it has become possible to generate a high-quality genome sequence. furthermore, cultivars exists that rival sugarcane in levels of stem sugar so that a genetic approach can be used to investigate which genes are differentially expressed to achieve high levels of stem sugar.


RESULTS
here, we characterized the small rna component of the transcriptome from grain and sweet sorghum stems, and from f <dig> plants derived from their cross that segregated for sugar content and flowering time. we found that variation in mir <dig> and mir <dig> expression correlated with flowering time whereas variation in mir <dig> expression correlated with sugar content in stems. interestingly, genotypic differences in the ratio of mir <dig> to mir395* were identified, with mir395* species expressed as abundantly as mir <dig> in sweet sorghum but not in grain sorghum. finally, we provided experimental evidence for previously annotated mirnas detecting the expression of  <dig> mirna families from the  <dig> known and discovered  <dig> new mirnas candidates in the sorghum genome.


CONCLUSIONS
sequencing the small rna component of sorghum stem tissue provides us with experimental evidence for previously predicted micrornas in the sorghum genome and micrornas with a potential role in stem sugar accumulation and flowering time.
