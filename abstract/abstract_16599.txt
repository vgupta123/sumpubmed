BACKGROUND
messenger rna expression is regulated by a complex interplay of different regulatory proteins. unfortunately, directly measuring the individual activity of these regulatory proteins is difficult, leaving us with only the resulting gene expression pattern as a marker for the underlying regulatory network or regulator-gene associations. furthermore, traditional methods to predict these regulator-gene associations do not define the relative importance of each association, leading to a large number of connections in the global regulatory network that, although true, are not useful.


RESULTS
here we present a bayesian method that identifies which known transcriptional relationships in a regulatory network are consistent with a given body of static gene expression data by eliminating the non-relevant ones. the partially observed bipartite network  approach developed here is tested using e. coli expression data and a transcriptional regulatory network derived from regulondb. when the regulatory network for e. coli was integrated with  <dig> e. coli gene chip observations, pobn identified  <dig> out of  <dig> connections that were either inconsistent or not adequately supported by the expression data.


CONCLUSIONS
pobn provides a systematic way to integrate known transcriptional networks with observed gene expression data to better identify which transcriptional pathways are likely responsible for the observed gene expression pattern.
