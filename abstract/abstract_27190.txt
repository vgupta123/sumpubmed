BACKGROUND
the aim of this study was to use transmission electron microscopy to describe the ultrastructural characteristics of clots obtained from canine and feline platelet concentrates  that had been activated with calcium gluconate  or cg plus batroxobin . platelets from fibrin clots were classified according their morphological changes. the area of the intercellular space , the area of the fibrin fibers , and the width of the fibrin fibers  were determined for the dog clots. the platelet area , the area of fibrin fibers , the ratio of the minor and major axes of platelets, the ratio of the major and minor axes of platelets, and the number of Î±-granules found within platelets were measured for the cat clots.


RESULTS
cat platelets displayed full activation. dog platelets displayed lysis with loss of normal architecture. in both species, a statistically significant difference was found  between the fibrin fiber measurements in the pc clots activated with cg and cgb.


CONCLUSIONS
the findings suggest that activation with cg caused platelet alpha granules to release their contents. in cats, fibrin production was greater when the pc was activated with cg. in dogs, activation with cg produced thick fibrin fibers.
