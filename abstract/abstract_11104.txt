BACKGROUND
splicing of dna molecules is an important task in molecular biology that facilitates cloning, mutagenesis and creation of chimeric genes. mutagenesis and dna splicing techniques exist, some requiring restriction enzymes, and others utilize staggered reannealing approaches.


RESULTS
a method for dna splicing and mutagenesis without restriction enzymes is described. the method is based on mild template-dependent polymerization arrest with two molecules of cytosine arabinose  incorporated into pcr primers. two rounds of pcr are employed: the first pcr produces 5' overhangs that are utilized for dna splicing. the second pcr is based on polymerization running through the ara-c molecules to produce the desired final product. to illustrate application of the run through stop mutagenesis and dna splicing technique, we have carried out splicing of two segments of the human cofilin  <dig> gene and introduced a mutational deletion into the product.


CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated the utility of a new pcr-based method for carrying out dna splicing and mutagenesis by incorporating ara-c into the pcr primers.
