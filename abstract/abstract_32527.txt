BACKGROUND
as a step towards understanding coral immunity we present the first whole transcriptome analysis of the acute responses of acropora millepora to challenge with the bacterial cell wall derivative mdp and the viral mimic poly i:c, defined immunogens provoking distinct but well characterised responses in higher animals.


RESULTS
these experiments reveal similarities with the responses both of arthropods and mammals, as well as coral-specific effects. the most surprising finding was that mdp specifically induced three members of the gimap gene family, which has been implicated in immunity in mammals but is absent from drosophila and caenorhabditis. like their mammalian homologs, gimap genes are arranged in a tandem cluster in the coral genome.


CONCLUSIONS
a phylogenomic survey of this gene family implies ancient origins, multiple independent losses and lineage-specific expansions during animal evolution. whilst functional convergence cannot be ruled out, gimap expression in corals may reflect an ancestral role in immunity, perhaps in phagolysosomal processing.
