BACKGROUND
increased defense against a variety of pathogens in plants is achieved through activation of a mechanism known as systemic acquired resistance . the broad-spectrum resistance brought about by sar is mediated through salicylic acid . an important step in sa biosynthesis in arabidopsis is the conversion of chorismate to isochorismate through the action of isochorismate synthase, encoded by the ics <dig> gene. also avrpphb susceptible  <dig>  plays an important role in sa metabolism, as pbs <dig> mutants accumulate drastically reduced levels of sa-glucoside, a putative storage form of sa. bioinformatics analysis previously performed by us identified wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> as possible regulators of ics <dig> and pbs <dig> 


RESULTS
expression studies with ics <dig> promoter::Î²-glucuronidase  genes in arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts cotransfected with 35s::wrky <dig> showed that over expression of wrky <dig> resulted in a strong increase in gus expression. moreover, qrt-pcr analyses indicated that the endogenous ics <dig> and pbs <dig> genes were highly expressed in protoplasts overexpressing wrky <dig> or wrky <dig>  respectively. electrophoretic mobility shift assays indentified potential wrky <dig> binding sites in the ics <dig> promoter, positioned - <dig> and - <dig> base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. mutation of these sites in protoplast transactivation assays showed that these binding sites are functionally important for activation of the ics <dig> promoter. chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with haemagglutinin-epitope-tagged wrky <dig> showed that the region of the ics <dig> promoter containing the binding sites at - <dig> and - <dig> was highly enriched in the immunoprecipitated dna.


CONCLUSIONS
the results obtained here confirm results from our multiple microarray co-expression analyses indicating that wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> are transcriptional activators of ics <dig> and pbs <dig>  respectively, and support this in silico screening as a powerful tool for identifying new components of stress signaling pathways.
