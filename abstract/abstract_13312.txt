BACKGROUND
amplification and cloning of naïve t cell receptor  repertoires or antigen-specific tr is crucial to shape immune response and to develop immuno-based therapies. tr variable  regions are encoded by several genes that recombine during t cell development. the cloning of expressed genes as large diverse libraries from natural sources relies upon the availability of primers able to amplify as many v genes as possible.


RESULTS
here, we present a list of primers computationally designed on all functional tr v and j genes listed in the imgt®, the immunogenetics information system®. the list consists of unambiguous or degenerate primers suitable to theoretically amplify and clone the entire tr repertoire. we show that it is possible to selectively amplify and clone expressed tr v genes in one single rt-pcr step and from as little as  <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
this new primer set will facilitate the creation of more diverse tr libraries than has been possible using currently available primer sets.
