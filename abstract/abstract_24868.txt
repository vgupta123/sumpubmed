BACKGROUND
the ddit <dig> gene encodes a transcription factor belonging to the ccaat/enhancer binding protein  family. it is normally expressed at very low levels but is activated by cellular stress conditions and induces g <dig> arrest and, in some cell types, apoptosis. ddit <dig> is found as a part of the fusion oncogene fus-ddit <dig> that is causal for the development of myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas .


RESULTS
in the present study, we searched for putative interaction partners of ddit <dig> and the oncogenic fus-ddit <dig> among g <dig> cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. we found that fus-ddit <dig> and the normal ddit <dig> bind cdk <dig>  in addition, cdk <dig> showed an increased affinity for cytoskeletal proteins in cells expressing fus-ddit <dig> and ddit <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that ddit <dig> binds cdk <dig> and that many of the observed biological effects of ddit <dig> may involve interaction with cdk <dig>
