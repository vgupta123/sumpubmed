BACKGROUND
dietzia natronolimnaea is one of the most important bacterial bioresources for high efficiency canthaxanthin production. it produces the robust and stable pigment canthaxanthin, which is of special interest for the development of integrated biorefineries. mutagenesis employing 12c6+ irradiation is a novel technique commonly used to improve microorganism productivity. this study presents a promising route to obtaining the highest feasible levels of biomass dry weight , and total canthaxanthin by using a microdosimetric model of 12c6+ irradiation mutation in combination with the optimization of nutrient medium components.


RESULTS
this work characterized the rate of both lethal and non-lethal dose mutations for 12c6+ irradiation and the microdosimetric kinetic model using the model organism, d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig> . irradiation with 12c6+ ions resulted in enhanced production of canthaxanthin, and is therefore an effective method for strain improvement of d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig> . based on these results an optimal dose of  <dig> – <dig>  gy, linear energy transfer  of  <dig> kev μm-1and energy of  <dig> mev u- <dig> for 12c6+ irradiation are ideal for optimum and specific production of canthaxanthin in the bacterium. second-order empirical calculations displaying high r-squared  values between the responses and independent variables were derived from validation experiments using response surface methodology. the highest canthaxanthin yield  was obtained with an optimized growth medium containing  <dig>  g l- <dig> d-glucose,  <dig>  g l- <dig> mannose and  <dig> ppm mg2+ in  <dig> l with an irradiation dose of  <dig>  gy.


CONCLUSIONS
the microdosimetric 12c6+ irradiation model was an effective mutagenic technique for the strain improvement of d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  specifically for enhanced canthaxanthin production. at the very least, random mutagenesis methods using 12c6+ions can be used as a first step in a combined approach with long-term continuous fermentation processes. central composite design-response surface methodologies  were carried out to optimize the conditions for canthaxanthin yield. it was discovered d-glucose, mg2+ and mannose have significant influence on canthaxanthin biosynthesis and growth of the mutant strain.
