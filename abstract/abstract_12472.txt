BACKGROUND
human rad <dig> , analogous to its bacterial homolog, reca, binds and unwinds double stranded dna  in the presence of certain nucleotide cofactors. atp hydrolysis is not required for this process, because even atp non hydrolysable analogs like amp-pnp and atpÎ³s, support dna unwinding. even adp, the product of atp hydrolysis, feebly supports dna unwinding.


RESULTS
we find that human rad <dig>  stimulates rad <dig> mediated dna unwinding in the presence of all adenine nucleotide cofactors,  while enhancing aggregation of rad51-dsdna complexes in parallel. interestingly, salt at low concentration can substitute the role of rad <dig>  in facilitating aggregation of rad51-dsdna complexes, that concomitantly also leads to better unwinding.


CONCLUSIONS
rad <dig> itself being a highly aggregated protein perhaps acts as scaffold to bring together rad <dig> and dna molecules into large co-aggregates of rad52-rad51-dna complexes to promote rad <dig> mediated dna unwinding reaction, when appropriate nucleotide cofactors are available, presumably through macromolecular crowding effects. our work highlights the functional link between aggregation of protein-dna complexes and dna unwinding in rad <dig> system.
