BACKGROUND
two year cancer bioassays conducted by the national toxicology program have shown chronic exposure to dioxin-like compounds  to lead to the development of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions in the hepatic tissue of female sprague dawley rats. most, if not all, of the hepatotoxic effects induced by dlc's are believed to involve the binding and activation of the transcription factor, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor . toxicogenomics was implemented to identify genomic responses that may be contributing to the development of hepatotoxicity in rats.


RESULTS
through comparative analysis of time-course microarray data, unique hepatic gene expression signatures were identified for the dlcs,  <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin   and  <dig> ', <dig> ',5-pentachlorobiphenyl   and the non-dlc  <dig> ', <dig> ', <dig> ',-hexachlorobiphenyl  . a common time independent signature of  <dig> ahr genomic biomarkers was identified which exhibited at least a 2-fold change in expression following subchronic  and chronic  p.o. exposure to tcdd and pcb <dig>  but not the non dlc, pcb <dig>  real time qpcr analysis validated that  <dig> of these genes also exhibited at least a 2-fold change in hepatic expression at  <dig> hr following a single exposure to tcdd . phenotypic anchoring was conducted which identified forty-six genes that were differently expressed both following chronic p.o. exposure to dlcs and in previously reported studies of cholangiocarcinoma or hepatocellular adenoma.


CONCLUSIONS
together these analyses provide a comprehensive description of the genomic responses which occur in rat hepatic tissue with exposure to ahr ligands and will help to isolate those genomic responses which are contributing to the hepatotoxicity observed with exposure to dlcs. in addition, the time independent gene expression signature of the ahr ligands may assist in identifying other agents with the potential to elicit dioxin-like hepatotoxic responses.
