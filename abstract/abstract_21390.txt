BACKGROUND
the application of dna markers for the identification of biological samples from both human and non-human species is widespread and includes use in food authentication. in the food industry the financial incentive to substituting the true name of a food product with a higher value alternative is driving food fraud. this applies to british pork products where products derived from traditional pig breeds are of premium value. the objective of this study was to develop a genetic assay for regulatory authentication of traditional pig breed-labelled products in the porcine food industry in the united kingdom.


RESULTS
the dataset comprised of a comprehensive coverage of breed types present in britain:  <dig> individuals from  <dig> traditional breeds,  <dig> commercial purebreds,  <dig> imported european breed and  <dig> imported asian breed were genotyped using the porcinesnp <dig> beadchip. following breed-informative snp selection, assignment power was calculated for increasing snp panel size. a 96-plex assay created using the most informative snps revealed remarkably high genetic differentiation between the british pig breeds, with an average fst of  <dig>  and bayesian clustering analysis also indicated that they were distinct homogenous populations. the posterior probability of assignment of any individual of a presumed origin actually originating from that breed given an alternative breed origin was >  <dig> % in  <dig> out of  <dig> contrasts, at a test value of log >  <dig>  validation of the 96-plex assay using independent test samples of known origin was successful; a subsequent survey of market samples revealed a high level of breed label conformity.


CONCLUSIONS
the newly created 96-plex assay using selected markers from the porcinesnp <dig> beadchip enables powerful assignment of samples to traditional breed origin and can effectively identify mislabelling, providing a highly effective tool for dna analysis in food forensics.
