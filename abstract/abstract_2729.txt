BACKGROUND
biomodels database is a reference repository of mathematical models used in biology. models are stored as sbml files on a file system and metadata is provided in a relational database. models can be retrieved through a web interface and programmatically via web services. in addition to those more traditional ways to access information, linked data using semantic web technologies , is becoming an increasingly popular means to describe and expose biological relevant data.


RESULTS
we present the biomodels linked dataset, which exposes the models’ content as a dereferencable interlinked dataset. biomodels linked dataset makes use of the wealth of annotations available within a large number of manually curated models to link and integrate data and models from other resources.


CONCLUSIONS
the biomodels linked dataset provides users with a dataset interoperable with other semantic web resources. it supports powerful search queries, some of which were not previously available to users and allow integration of data from multiple resources. this provides a distributed platform to find similar models for comparison, processing and enrichment.
