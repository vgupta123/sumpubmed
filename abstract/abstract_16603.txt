BACKGROUND
irradiation with light wavelengths from the far red  to the near infrared  spectrum  has been shown to have beneficial effects in several disease models. in this study, we aim to examine whether 670 nm red light pretreatment can provide protection against hyperoxia-induced damage in the c57bl/6j mouse retina. adult mice  were pretreated with 9 j/cm <dig> of 670 nm light once daily for  <dig> consecutive days prior to being placed in hyperoxic environment . control groups were exposed to hyperoxia, but received no 670 nm light pretreatment. retinas were collected after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 14 days of hyperoxia exposure  and prepared either for histological analysis, or rna extraction and quantitative polymerase chain reaction . photoreceptor damage and loss were quantified by counting photoreceptors undergoing cell death and measuring photoreceptor layer thickness. localization of acrolein, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit va  were identified through immunohistochemistry. expression of heme oxygenase- <dig> , complement component  <dig>  and fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  genes were quantified using qpcr.


RESULTS
the hyperoxia-induced photoreceptor loss was accompanied by reduction of metabolic marker, cox va, and increased expression of oxidative stress indicator, acrolein and hmox- <dig>  pretreatment with 670 nm red light reduced expression of markers of oxidative stress and c <dig>  and slowed, but did not prevent, photoreceptor loss over the time course of hyperoxia exposure.


CONCLUSIONS
the damaging effects of hyperoxia on photoreceptors were ameliorated following pretreatment with 670 nm light in hyperoxic mouse retinas. these results suggest that pretreatment with 670 nm light may provide stability to photoreceptors in conditions of oxidative stress.
