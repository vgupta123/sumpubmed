BACKGROUND
wd <dig> domains have been found in a plethora of eukaryotic proteins, acting as scaffolding molecules assisting proper activity of other proteins, and are involved in multi-cellular processes. they comprise several stretches of 44- <dig> amino acid residues often terminating with a wd di-peptide. they act as a site of protein-protein interactions or multi-interacting platforms, driving the assembly of protein complexes or as mediators of transient interplay among other proteins. in arabidopsis, members of wd <dig> protein superfamily are known as key regulators of plant-specific events, biologically playing important roles in development and also during stress signaling.


RESULTS
using reverse genetic and protein modeling approaches, we characterize gigantus <dig> , a new member of wd <dig> repeat protein in arabidopsis thaliana and provide evidence of its role in controlling plant growth development. gts <dig> is highly expressed during embryo development and negatively regulates seed germination, biomass yield and growth improvement in plants. structural modeling analysis suggests that gts <dig> folds into a β-propeller with seven pseudo symmetrically arranged blades around a central axis. molecular docking analysis shows that gts <dig> physically interacts with two ribosomal protein partners, a component of ribosome nop <dig>  and a ribosome-biogenesis factor l19e through β-propeller blade  <dig> to regulate cell growth development.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that gts <dig> might function in plant developmental processes by regulating ribosomal structural features, activities and biogenesis in plant cells. our results suggest that gigantus <dig> might be a promising target to engineer transgenic plants with higher biomass and improved growth development for plant-based bioenergy production.
