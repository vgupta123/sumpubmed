BACKGROUND
the repertoire of the antigen-binding receptors originates from the rearrangement of immunoglobulin and t-cell receptor genetic loci in a process known as vj recombination. the initial site-specific dna cleavage steps of this process are catalyzed by the lymphoid specific proteins rag <dig> and rag <dig>  the majority of studies on rag <dig> and rag <dig> have focused on the minimal, core regions required for catalytic activity. though not absolutely required, non-core regions of rag <dig> and rag <dig> have been shown to influence the efficiency and fidelity of the recombination reaction.


RESULTS
using a partial proteolysis approach in combination with bioinformatics analyses, we identified the domain boundaries of a structural domain that is present in the 380-residue n-terminal non-core region of rag <dig>  we term this domain the central non-core domain .


CONCLUSIONS
we show how the cnd alone, and in combination with other regions of non-core rag <dig>  functions in nuclear localization, zinc coordination, and interactions with nucleic acid. together, these results demonstrate the multiple roles that the non-core region can play in the function of the full length protein.
