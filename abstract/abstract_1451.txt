BACKGROUND
we report here the first genome-wide high-resolution polymorphism resource for non-human primate  association and linkage studies, constructed for the caribbean-origin vervet monkey, or african green monkey , one of the most widely used nhps in biomedical research. we generated this resource by whole genome sequencing  of monkeys from the vervet research colony , an nih-supported research resource for which extensive phenotypic data are available.


RESULTS
we identified genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms  by wgs of  <dig> members of an extended pedigree from the vrc. from high-depth wgs data we identified more than  <dig> million polymorphic unequivocal segregating sites; by pruning these snps based on heterozygosity, quality control filters, and the degree of linkage disequilibrium  between snps, we constructed genome-wide panels suitable for genetic association  and linkage analysis . to further enhance the utility of these resources for linkage analysis, we used a further pruned subset of the linkage panel to generate multipoint identity by descent matrices.


CONCLUSIONS
the genetic and phenotypic resources now available for the vrc and other caribbean-origin vervets enable their use for genetic investigation of traits relevant to human diseases.
