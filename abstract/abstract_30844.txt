BACKGROUND
streptomyces coelicolor is the most studied streptomyces species and an excellent model for studying differentiation and antibiotic production. to date, many genes have been identified to be required for its differentiation  and antibiotics production .


RESULTS
a gene cluster containing six genes  was proved to be co-transcribed in s. coelicolor. deletions of cmdabcdef  displayed defective sporulation including formation of aberrant branches, and abnormalities in chromosome segregation and spore septation. disruption mutants of apparently orthologous genes of s. lividans and s. avermitilis also showed defective sporulation, implying that the role of these genes is similar among streptomyces. transcription of cmdb, and therefore presumably of the whole operon, was regulated developmentally. five of the encoded proteins  were predicted membrane proteins. the other, cmdb, a predicted atp/gtp-binding protein with an abc-transporter-atpase domain shown here to be essential for its function, was also located on the cell membrane. these results indicate that cmdabcdef proteins mainly affect streptomyces differentiation at an early stage of aerial hyphae formation, and suggest that these proteins may form a complex on cell membrane for proper segregation of chromosomes. in addition, deletions of cmdabcdef also revealed over-production of blue-pigmented actinorhodin  via activation of transcription of the pathway-specific regulatory gene actii-orf <dig> of actinorhodin biosynthesis.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, six co-transcribed genes cmdabcdef were identified by their effects on differentiation and antibiotic production in streptomyces coelicolor a <dig>  these six membrane-located proteins are possibly assembled into a complex to function.
