BACKGROUND
the melon belongs to the cucurbitaceae family, whose economic importance among vegetable crops is second only to solanaceae. the melon has a small genome size , which makes it suitable for molecular and genetic studies. despite similar nuclear and chloroplast genome sizes, cucurbits show great variation when their mitochondrial genomes are compared. the melon possesses the largest plant mitochondrial genome, as much as eight times larger than that of other cucurbits.


RESULTS
the nucleotide sequences of the melon chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes were determined. the chloroplast genome  included  <dig> genes, with  <dig> single-copy genes dispersed between the small  and large  single-copy regions and  <dig> duplicated genes in the inverted repeat regions . a comparison of the cucumber and melon chloroplast genomes showed differences in only approximately 5% of nucleotides, mainly due to short indels and snps. additionally,  <dig>  mb of mitochondrial sequence, accounting for 95% of the estimated mitochondrial genome size, were assembled into five scaffolds and four additional unscaffolded contigs. an 84% of the mitochondrial genome is contained in a single scaffold. the gene-coding region accounted for  <dig> %  of the total sequence, including  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> conserved orfs,  <dig> rrna genes and  <dig> trna genes. despite the differences observed in the mitochondrial genome sizes of cucurbit species, citrullus lanatus , cucurbita pepo  and cucumis melo  share  <dig> kb of sequence, including the predicted protein-coding regions. nevertheless, melon contained a high number of repetitive sequences and a high content of dna of nuclear origin, which represented 42% and 47% of the total sequence, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
whereas the size and gene organisation of chloroplast genomes are similar among the cucurbit species, mitochondrial genomes show a wide variety of sizes, with a non-conserved structure both in gene number and organisation, as well as in the features of the noncoding dna. the transfer of nuclear dna to the melon mitochondrial genome and the high proportion of repetitive dna appear to explain the size of the largest mitochondrial genome reported so far.
