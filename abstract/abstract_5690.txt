BACKGROUND
climate change poses a multi-dimensional threat to food and agricultural systems as a result of increased risk to animal growth, development, health, and food product quality. this study was designed to characterize transcriptional changes induced in turkey muscle satellite cells cultured under cold or hot thermal challenge to better define molecular mechanisms by which thermal stress alters breast muscle ultrastructure.


RESULTS
satellite cells isolated from the pectoralis major muscle of 7-weeks-old male turkeys from two breeding lines  were proliferated in culture at 33 °c, 38 °c or 43 °c for 72 h. total rna was isolated and  <dig> libraries subjected to rnaseq analysis. statistically significant differences in gene expression were observed among treatments and between turkey lines with a greater number of genes altered by cold treatment than by hot and fewer differences observed between lines than between temperatures. pathway analysis found that cold treatment resulted in an overrepresentation of genes involved in cell signaling/signal transduction and cell communication/cell signaling as compared to control . heat-treated muscle satellite cells showed greater tendency towards expression of genes related to muscle system development and differentiation.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates significant transcriptome effects on turkey skeletal muscle satellite cells exposed to thermal challenge. additional effects on gene expression could be attributed to genetic selection for  <dig> weeks body weight . new targets are identified for further research on the differential control of satellite cell proliferation in poultry.
