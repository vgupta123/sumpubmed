BACKGROUND
ribonuclease iii  activity modulates hundreds of genes in escherichia coli . ymdb, a member of the macrodomain protein family, is one of known trans-acting regulators of rnase iii activity; however, the significance of its regulatory role in specific bacterial cellular processes and related genes has not been determined. ymdb overexpression was used to model ymdb-induced rnase iii inhibition in vivo, and microarray analysis identified gene targets and cellular processes related to rnase iii inhibition.


RESULTS
the expression of > <dig>  e. coli genes was modulated by ymdb induction;  <dig> genes were strongly regulated, of which  <dig> have not been reported as rnase iii targets. of these, ten are involved in biofilm formation. significantly, ymdb overexpression also inhibited biofilm formation via a process that is not uniquely dependent upon rnase iii inhibition. moreover, biofilm formation is interdependently regulated by rpos, a known stress response regulator and biofilm inhibitor, and by ymdb.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first global profile of target genes modulated by ymdb-induced rnase iii inhibition in e. coli, and the data reveal a novel, hitherto unrecognized regulatory role for ymdb in biofilm modulation.
