BACKGROUND
cysteine sulfenic acid  plays important roles in the redox regulation of numerous proteins. as a relatively unstable posttranslational protein modification it is difficult to quantify the degree to which any particular protein is modified by cys-soh within a complex biological environment. the goal of these studies was to move a step beyond detection and into the relative quantification of cys-soh within specific proteins found in a complex biological setting--namely, human plasma.


RESULTS
this report describes the possibilities and limitations of performing such analyses based on the use of thionitrobenzoic acid and dimedone-based probes which are commonly employed to trap cys-soh. results obtained by electrospray ionization-based mass spectrometric immunoassay reveal the optimal type of probe for such analyses as well as the reproducible relative quantification of cys-soh within albumin and transthyretin extracted from human plasma--the latter as a protein previously unknown to be modified by cys-soh.


CONCLUSIONS
the relative quantification of cys-soh within specific proteins in a complex biological setting can be accomplished, but several analytical precautions related to trapping, detecting, and quantifying cys-soh must be taken into account prior to pursuing its study in such matrices.
