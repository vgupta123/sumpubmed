BACKGROUND
inference of gene regulation from expression data may help to unravel regulatory mechanisms involved in complex diseases or in the action of specific drugs. a challenging task for many researchers working in the field of systems biology is to build up an experiment with a limited budget and produce a dataset suitable to reconstruct putative regulatory modules worth of biological validation.


RESULTS
here, we focus on small-scale gene expression screens and we introduce a novel experimental set-up and a customized method of analysis to make inference on regulatory modules starting from genetic perturbation data, e.g. knockdown and overexpression data. to illustrate the utility of our strategy, it was applied to produce and analyze a dataset of quantitative real-time rt-pcr data, in which interferon-α  transcriptional response in endothelial cells is investigated by rna silencing of two candidate ifn-α modulators, stat <dig> and ifih <dig>  a putative regulatory module was reconstructed by our method, revealing an intriguing feed-forward loop, in which stat <dig> regulates ifih <dig> and they both negatively regulate ifnar <dig>  stat <dig> regulation on ifnar <dig> was object of experimental validation at the protein level.


CONCLUSIONS
detailed description of the experimental set-up and of the analysis procedure is reported, with the intent to be of inspiration for other scientists who want to realize similar experiments to reconstruct gene regulatory modules starting from perturbations of possible regulators. application of our approach to the study of ifn-α transcriptional response modulators in endothelial cells has led to many interesting novel findings and new biological hypotheses worth of validation.
