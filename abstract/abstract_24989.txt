BACKGROUND
the species azospirillum amazonense belongs to a well-known genus of plant growth-promoting bacteria. this bacterium is found in association with several crops of economic importance; however, there is a lack of information on its physiology. in this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the genomic features of this species.


RESULTS
genes of a. amazonense related to nitrogen/carbon metabolism, energy production, phytohormone production, transport, quorum sensing, antibiotic resistance, chemotaxis/motility and bacteriophytochrome biosynthesis were identified. noteworthy genes were the nitrogen fixation genes and the nitrilase gene, which could be directly implicated in plant growth promotion, and the carbon fixation genes, which had previously been poorly investigated in this genus. one important finding was that some a. amazonense genes, like the nitrogenase genes and rubisco genes, were closer phylogenetically to rhizobiales members than to species of its own order.


CONCLUSIONS
the species a. amazonense presents a versatile repertoire of genes crucial for its plant-associated lifestyle.
