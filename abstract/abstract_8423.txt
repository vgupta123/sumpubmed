BACKGROUND
cotton  fibers are single-celled elongated trichomes, the molecular aspects of genetic variation in fiber length  among genotypes are currently unknown. in this study, two backcross inbred lines , i.e., nmga- <dig>  and nmga- <dig>  with  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  mm in fl, respectively, were chosen to perform rna-seq on developing fibers at 10 days post anthesis . the two bils differed in  <dig> quantitative trait loci  for fl and were developed from backcrosses between g. hirsutum as the recurrent parent and g. barbadense.


RESULTS
in total,  <dig>  and  <dig>  million reads were obtained and assembled to  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts in the two genotypes, respectively. of 1﻿ <dig> differentially expressed genes  between the two bils,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated in “long”; and  <dig> snps were identified in  <dig> degs. further physical mapping showed that  <dig> degs were co-localized with the  <dig> fl qtl identified in the bil population containing the two bils. four snp markers in  <dig> degs that showed significant correlations with fl were developed. among the three candidate genes encoding for proline-rich protein, d-cysteine desulfhydrase, and thaumatin-like protein, a snp of thaumatin-like protein gene showed consistent correlations with fl across all testing environments.


CONCLUSIONS
this study represents one of the first investigations of positional candidate gene approach of qtl in cotton in integrating transcriptome and snp identification based on rna-seq with linkage and physical mapping of qtl and genes, which will facilitate eventual cloning and identification of genes responsible for fl qtl. the candidate genes may serve as the foundation for further in-depth studies of the molecular mechanism of natural variation in fiber elongation.
