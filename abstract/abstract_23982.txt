BACKGROUND
alus are primate-specific retrotransposons which account for  <dig> % of the human genome. a large number of protein-coding mrnas are encoded with sense or antisense alus in the un-translated regions.


RESULTS
we postulated that mrnas carrying alus in the two opposite directions can generate double stranded rnas, capable of regulating the levels of other alu-carrying mrnas post-transcriptionally. a gene expression profiling assay showed that the levels of antisense and sense alus-carrying mrnas were suppressed in a reversible manner by over-expression of exogenous sense and antisense alus derived from mrnas . screening through human mrnas on the ncbi-refseq database, it was found that sense and antisense alu-carrying transcripts were enriched in distinct cellular functions. antisense alu-carrying genes were particularly enriched in neurological and developmental processes, while sense alu-carrying genes were enriched in immunological functions.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, we proposed a novel alu-mediated regulation network capable of stabilizing alu-carrying mrna levels in different cell types and restricting the activated expression levels of protein-coding, alu-carrying mrnas.
