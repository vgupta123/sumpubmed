BACKGROUND
paratuberculosis caused by mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis  is difficult to control due to a long phase of clinically non-apparent  infection for which sensitive diagnostics are lacking. a defined animal model for this phase of the infection can help to investigate host-map interactions in apparently healthy animals and identify surrogate markers for disease progress and might also serve as challenge model for vaccines. to establish such a model in goats, different age at inoculation and doses of oral inoculum of map were compared. clinical signs, faecal shedding as well as map-specific antibody, ifn-γ and il- <dig> responses were used for in vivo monitoring. at necropsy, about one year after inoculation , pathomorphological findings and bacterial organ burden  were scored.


RESULTS
map infection manifested in 26/ <dig> inoculated animals irrespective of age at inoculation and dose. clinical signs developed in three goats. faecal shedding, ifn-γ and antibody responses emerged  <dig>  10– <dig> and  <dig> wpi, respectively, and continued with large inter-individual variation. one year pi, lesions were detected in  <dig> and map was cultured from tissues of  <dig> goats. positive animals subdivided in those with high and low overall bob. intestinal findings resembled paucibacillary lesions in  <dig> and multibacillary in  <dig> goats. caseous and calcified granulomas predominated in intestinal lnn. bob and lesion score corresponded well in intestinal mucosa and ogalt but not in intestinal lnn.


CONCLUSIONS
a defined experimental infection model for the clinically non-apparent phase of paratuberculosis was established in goats as suitable basis for future studies.
