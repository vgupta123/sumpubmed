BACKGROUND
prader-willi and angelman syndrome  patients typically have an ~ <dig> mb deletion of human chromosome 15q11-q <dig>  of opposite parental origin. a mouse model of pws and as has a transgenic insertion-deletion  of chromosome 7b/c subsequent to paternal or maternal inheritance, respectively. in this study, we define the deletion endpoints and examine the impact on expression of flanking genes.


RESULTS
using molecular and cytological methods we demonstrate that  <dig> imprinted and  <dig> non-imprinted genes are included in the tgpws/tgas deletion. normal expression levels were found in tgpws brain for genes extending  <dig> - or  <dig> -mb centromeric or telomeric of the deletion, respectively. our molecular cytological studies map the proximal deletion breakpoint between the luzp <dig> and siglec-h loci, and we show that overall mrna levels of luzp <dig> in tgpws and tgas brain are significantly reduced by 17%. intriguingly, 5' chrna <dig> shows  <dig> -fold decreased levels in tgpws and tgas brain whereas there is a ≥15-fold increase in expression in neonatal liver and spleen of these mouse models. by isolating a chrna7-tg fusion transcript from tgas mice, we mapped the telomeric deletion breakpoint in chrna <dig> intron  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
based on the extent of the deletion, tgpws/tgas mice are models for pws/as class i deletions. other than for the first gene promoters immediately outside the deletion, since genes extending  <dig> – <dig>  mb away from each end of the deletion show normal expression levels in tgpws brain, this indicates that the transgene array does not induce silencing and there are no additional linked rearrangements. using gene expression, non-coding conserved sequence  and synteny data, we have genetically mapped a putative luzp <dig> neuronal enhancer responsible for ~33% of allelic transcriptional activity. the chrna <dig> results are explained by hypothesizing loss of an essential neuronal transcriptional enhancer required for ~80% of allelic chrna <dig> promoter activity, while the chrna <dig> promoter is upregulated in b lymphocytes by the transgene immunoglobulin enhancer. the mapping of a putative chrna <dig> neuronal enhancer inside the deletion has significant implications for understanding the transcriptional regulation of this schizophrenia-susceptibility candidate gene.
