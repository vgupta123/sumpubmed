BACKGROUND
corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis is generally regarded as an important animal pathogen that rarely infects humans. clinical strains are occasionally recovered from human cases of lymphadenitis, such as c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> that was isolated from the inguinal lymph node of a 12-year-old girl with necrotizing lymphadenitis. to detect potential virulence factors and corresponding gene-regulatory networks in this human isolate, the genome sequence of c. pseudotuberculosis fcr <dig> was determined by pyrosequencing and functionally annotated.


RESULTS
sequencing and assembly of the c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> genome yielded a circular chromosome with a size of  <dig> , <dig> bp and a mean g+c content of  <dig> %. specific gene sets associated with iron and zinc homeostasis were detected among the  <dig>  predicted protein-coding regions and integrated into a gene-regulatory network that is linked with both the central metabolism and the oxidative stress response of frc <dig>  two gene clusters encode proteins involved in the sortase-mediated polymerization of adhesive pili that can probably mediate the adherence to host tissue to facilitate additional ligand-receptor interactions and the delivery of virulence factors. the prominent virulence factors phospholipase d  and corynebacterial protease cp <dig> are encoded in the genome of this human isolate. the genome annotation revealed additional serine proteases, neuraminidase h, nitric oxide reductase, an invasion-associated protein, and acyl-coa carboxylase subunits involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis as potential virulence factors. the camp-sensing transcription regulator glxr plays a key role in controlling the expression of several genes contributing to virulence.


CONCLUSIONS
the functional data deduced from the genome sequencing and the extended knowledge of virulence factors indicate that the human isolate c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> is equipped with a distinct gene set promoting its survival under unfavorable environmental conditions encountered in the mammalian host.
