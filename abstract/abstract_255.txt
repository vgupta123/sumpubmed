BACKGROUND
shigella is a major pathogen responsible for bacillary dysentery, a severe form of shigellosis. severity of the disease depends on the virulence of the infecting strain. shigella pathogenicity is a multi-gene phenomenon, involving the participation of genes on an unstable large virulence plasmid and chromosomal pathogenicity islands.


RESULTS
a multiplex pcr  assay was developed to detect s. flexneri 2a from rural regions of zhengding . we isolated and tested  <dig> strains using our mpcr assay, which targeted the ipah, ial and set1b genes. a clinical strain of s. flexneri 2a  <dig>  containing ipah and ial, but lacking set1b was found. the virulence of this strain was found to be markedly decreased. further testing showed that the sf <dig> strain lacked pic. to investigate the role of pic in s. flexneri 2a infections, a pic knockout mutant  and two complementation strains, sf301-∆ pic/ppic and sf51/ppic, were created. differences in virulence for sf <dig>  sf301-∆ pic, sf301-∆ pic/ppic, sf51/ppic and s. flexneri 2a  <dig>  were compared. compared with sf <dig>  both sf <dig> and sf301-∆ pic exhibited lower levels of hela cell invasion and resulted in reduced keratoconjunctivitis, with low levels of tissue damage seen in murine eye sections. the virulence of sf301-∆ pic and sf <dig> was partially recovered in vitro and in vivo through the addition of a complementary pic gene.


CONCLUSIONS
the pic gene appears to be involved in an increase in pathogenicity of s. flexneri 2a. this gene assists with bacterial invasion into host cells and alters inflammatory reactions.
