BACKGROUND
recent advances in sequencing technologies make it possible to comprehensively study structural variations  using sequence data of large-scale populations. currently, more efforts have been taken to develop methods that call svs with exact breakpoints. among these approaches, split-read mapping methods can be applied on low-coverage sequence data. with increasing amount of data generated, more efficient split-read mapping methods are still needed. also, since sequence errors can not be avoided for the current sequencing technologies, more accurate split-read mapping methods are still needed to better handle sequence errors.


RESULTS
in this paper, we present a split-read mapping method implemented in the program svseq <dig> which improves our previous work svseq <dig>  similar to svseq <dig>  svseq <dig> calls deletions  with exact breakpoints. svseq <dig> achieves more accurate calling through split-read mapping within focal regions. svseq <dig> also has a much desired feature: there is no need to specify the maximum deletion size, while some existing split-read mapping methods need more memory and longer running time when larger maximum deletion size is chosen. svseq <dig> is also much faster because it only needs to examine a small number of ways of splitting the reads. moreover, svseq <dig> supports insertion calling from low-coverage sequence data, while svseq <dig> only supports deletion finding. the program svseq <dig> can be downloaded at http://www.engr.uconn.edu/~jiz08001/.


CONCLUSIONS
svseq <dig> enables accurate and efficient sv calling through split-read mapping within focal regions using paired-end reads. for many simulated data and real sequence data, svseq <dig> outperforms some other existing approaches in accuracy and efficiency, especially when sequence coverage is low.
