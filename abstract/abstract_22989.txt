BACKGROUND
although respiratory diseases exhibit in a wide array of clinical manifestations, certain respiratory diseases may share related genetic mechanisms or may be influenced by similar chemical stimuli. here we explore and infer relationships among genes, diseases, and chemicals using network and matrix based clustering methods.


RESULTS
in order to better understand and elucidate these shared genetic mechanisms and chemical relationships we analyzed a comprehensive collection of gene, disease, and chemical relationships pertinent to respiratory disease, using network and matrix based analysis approaches. our methods enabled us to analyze relationships and make biological inferences among over  <dig> different respiratory and related diseases, involving thousands of gene-chemical-disease relationships.


CONCLUSIONS
the resulting networks provided insight into shared mechanisms of respiratory disease and in some cases suggest novel targets or repurposed drug strategies.
