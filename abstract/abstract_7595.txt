BACKGROUND
bovine leukemia virus  is worldwide distributed and highly endemic in argentina. among the strategies to prevent blv dissemination, a control plan based on the selective segregation of animals according to their proviral load  is promising for our dairy productive system. the objective of this work was to study the relationship between the blood pvl and the antibody level, in order to identify whether the individual humoral response, i.e. the anti-p <dig> or anti-whole-blv particle, could be used as a marker of the blood level of infection and thus help to recruit animals that may pose a lower risk of dissemination under natural conditions.


RESULTS
the prevalence of p <dig> antibodies on the  <dig> farms studied was over 66%. the prevalence of p <dig> and whole-blv antibodies and pvl quantification were analyzed in all the samples  taken from herds t <dig> and  <dig>  roc analysis showed a higher auc for p <dig> antibodies than whole-blv antibodies , and as consequence a better performance to predict the proviral load status in herd  <dig>  no significant differences were found between the performance of p <dig> and whole-blv antibodies in herd t <dig>  a significant positive correlation was observed between pvl values and p <dig> antibody reactivity in both farms . the analysis was extended to the whole number of weak p <dig> antibody reactors  of the other  <dig> farms. the mean of high pvl reactors within weak p <dig> reactors was  <dig> % . in 5/ <dig> farms, the number of weak p <dig> reactors with high pvl was lower than 10%.


CONCLUSIONS
we found that the humoral response reflected the level of in vivo infection, and may therefore have useful epidemiological applications. whereas the quantitative evaluation of blood proviral load using real-time pcr is expensive and technically demanding, the measurement of antibodies in blood by elisa is relatively straightforward and could therefore constitute a cost-effective tool in a blv control intervention strategy, especially in highly infected herds such as argentinean dairy ones.
