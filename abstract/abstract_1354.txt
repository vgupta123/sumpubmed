BACKGROUND
due to its variegated and colorful leaves, ornamental kale  has become a popular ornamental plant. in this study, we report the fine mapping and analysis of a candidate purple leaf gene using a backcross population and an f <dig> population derived from two parental lines: w <dig>  and p <dig> .


RESULTS
genetic analysis indicated that the purple leaf trait is controlled by a single dominant gene, which we named bopr. using markers developed based on the reference genome ‘02–12’, the bopr gene was preliminarily mapped to a 280-kb interval of chromosome c <dig>  with flanking markers m <dig> and boid <dig> at genetic distances of  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively. the recombination rate within this interval is almost  <dig> times higher than the usual level, which could be caused by assembly error for reference genome ‘02–12’ at this interval. primers were designed based on ‘to1000’, another b. oleracea reference genome. among the newly designed indel markers, brid <dig> and brid <dig> were found to be the closest to bopr, flanking the gene at genetic distances of  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively; the interval between the two markers is  <dig>  kb . seven annotated genes are located within the  <dig>  kb genomic region, of which only bo9g <dig> shows high homology to at5g <dig> , which was identified as a candidate gene for bopr. blast analysis revealed that this  <dig>  kb interval is located on an unanchored scaffold  of ‘02–12’, confirming the existence of assembly error at the interval between m <dig> and boid <dig> for reference genome ‘02–12’.


CONCLUSIONS
this study identified a candidate gene for bopr and lays a foundation for the cloning and functional analysis of this gene.
