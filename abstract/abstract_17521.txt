BACKGROUND
immunomagnetic separation  and immunoassays are widely used for pathogen detection. however, novel technology platforms with highly selective antibodies are essential to improve detection sensitivity, specificity and performance. in this study, monoclonal antibodies  against internalin a  and p <dig> were generated and used on paramagnetic beads of varying diameters for concentration, as well as on fiber-optic sensor for detection.


RESULTS
anti-inla mab-2d <dig>  was specific for listeria monocytogenes and l. ivanovii, and p30-specific mab-3f <dig>  was specific for the genus listeria. at all bacterial concentrations  tested in the ims assay; the 1-μm diameter myone beads had significantly higher capture efficiency  than the  <dig> -μm diameter m- <dig> beads with both antibodies. the highest capture efficiency for myone-2d <dig>  was significantly higher  than that of myone-3f <dig>  and dynabeads anti-listeria antibody . furthermore, capture efficiency for myone-2d <dig> was highly specific for l. monocytogenes and l. ivanovii. subsequently, we captured l. monocytogenes by myone-2d <dig> and myone-3f <dig> from hotdogs inoculated with mono- or co-cultures of l. monocytogenes and l. innocua , enriched for 18 h and detected by fiber-optic sensor and confirmed by plating, light-scattering, and qpcr assays. the detection limit for l. monocytogenes and l. ivanovii by the fiber-optic immunosensor was 3 × 102 cfu/ml using mab-2d <dig> as capture and reporter antibody. selective media plating, light-scattering, and qpcr assays confirmed the ims and fiber-optic results.


CONCLUSIONS
ims coupled with a fiber-optic sensor using anti-inla mab is highly specific for l. monocytogenes and l. ivanovii and enabled detection of these pathogens at low levels from buffer or food.
