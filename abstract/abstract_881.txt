BACKGROUND
protein-protein docking is a challenging computational problem in functional genomics, particularly when one or both proteins undergo conformational change upon binding. the major challenge is to define a scoring function soft enough to tolerate these changes and specific enough to distinguish between near-native and "misdocked" conformations.


RESULTS
using a linear programming  technique, we developed two types of potentials:  side chain-based and  heavy atom-based. to achieve this we considered a set of  <dig> transient complexes and generated a large set of putative docked structures , based on a shape complementarity criterion, for each complex. the demand on the potentials was to yield, for the native  structure, a potential energy lower than those of any of the non-native  structures. we show that the heavy atom-based potentials were able to comply with this requirement but not the side chain-based one. thus, despite the smaller number of parameters, the capability of heavy atom-based potentials to discriminate between native and "misdocked" conformations is improved relative to those of the side chain-based potentials. the performance of the atom-based potentials was evaluated by a jackknife test on a set of  <dig> complexes taken from the zdock <dig>  decoys set.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that, using the lp approach, we were able to train our potentials using a dataset of transient complexes only the newly developed potentials outperform three other known potentials in this test.
