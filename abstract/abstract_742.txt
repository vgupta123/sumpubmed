BACKGROUND
a panel of  <dig> rabies virus isolates were collected and studied, originating mainly from the northern and central regions of namibia, between  <dig> and  <dig> 


RESULTS
these virus isolates demonstrated a high degree of genetic similarity with respect to a  <dig> bp region of the nucleoprotein gene, with the virus isolates originating from kudu antelope  sharing  <dig> –100% similarity with jackal isolates, and 97–100% similarity with those isolated from domestic dogs. phylogenetic analysis suggested that these viruses were all of the canid rabies biotype of southern africa. the viruses from kudu were closely associated with jackal isolates , bat-eared fox isolates  and domestic dog isolates  at the genetic level and identical at the amino acid level, irrespective of the year of isolation.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that jackal and kudu may form part of the same epidemiological cycle of rabies in namibian wildlife, and might demonstrate the close-relationship between rabies virus strains that circulate within namibia and those that circulate between namibia and its neighbouring countries such as botswana and south africa.
