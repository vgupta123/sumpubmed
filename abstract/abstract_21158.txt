BACKGROUND
the emergence of west nile virus  in north america has been associated with high mortality in the native avifauna and has raised concerns about the long-term impact of wnv on bird populations. here, we present results from a longitudinal analysis of annual counts of six bird species, using north american breeding bird survey data from ten states . we fit overdispersed poisson models to annual counts. counts from successive years were linked by an autoregressive process that depended on wnv transmission intensity  and was adjusted by el ni√±o southern oscillation events. these models were fit using a markov chain monte carlo algorithm.


RESULTS
model fit was mostly excellent, especially for american crows, for which our models explained between 26% and 81% of the observed variance. the impact of wnv on bird populations was quantitatively evaluated by contrasting hypothetical count trajectories  with observed counts. populations of american crows were most consistently affected with a substantial cumulative impact in six of ten states. the largest negative impact, almost 60%, was found in illinois. a regionally substantial decline was also seen for american robins and house sparrows, while the other species appeared unaffected.


CONCLUSIONS
our results confirm findings from previous studies that single out american crows as the species most vulnerable to wnv infection. we discuss strengths and limitations of this and other methods for quantifying the impact of wnv on bird populations.
