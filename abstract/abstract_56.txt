BACKGROUND
rna editing is a type of post-transcriptional modification of rna and belongs to the class of mechanisms that contribute to the complexity of transcriptomes. c-to-u rna editing is commonly observed in plant mitochondria and chloroplasts. the in vivo mechanism of recognizing c-to-u rna editing sites is still unknown. in recent years, many efforts have been made to computationally predict c-to-u rna editing sites in the mitochondria of seed plants, but there is still no algorithm available for c-to-u rna editing site prediction in the chloroplasts of seed plants.


RESULTS
in this paper, we extend our algorithm cure, which can accurately predict the c-to-u rna editing sites in mitochondria, to predict c-to-u rna editing sites in the chloroplasts of seed plants. the algorithm achieves over 80% sensitivity and over 99% specificity. we implement the algorithm as an online service called cure-chloroplast .


CONCLUSIONS
cure-chloroplast is an online service for predicting the c-to-u rna editing sites in the chloroplasts of seed plants. the online service allows the processing of entire chloroplast genome sequences. since cure-chloroplast performs very well, it could be a helpful tool in the study of c-to-u rna editing in the chloroplasts of seed plants.
