BACKGROUND
the development of transgenic plants as a production platform for biomass-degrading enzymes is a promising tool for an economically feasible allocation of enzymes processing lignocellulose. previous research has already identified a major limitation of in planta production such as interference with the structure and integrity of the plant cell wall resulting in a negative influence on plant growth and development.


RESULTS
here, we describe the in planta expression of endoglucanase trcel5a from the mesophilic fungus trichoderma reesei with differential intracellular targeting and evaluate its impact on the tobacco cell wall composition. targeting of the enzyme to the apoplast leads to distinct changes in cell polysaccharides such as glucose level in the matrix polysaccharides . these effects are combined with severe changes in plant development. retention of trcel5a in the endoplasmic reticulum  could avoid visible effects on plant growth under the chosen conditions, but exhibits changes in the composition of the mps.


CONCLUSIONS
these results give new insights into the complex interaction of heterologous cellulase expression with cell wall development and it outlines novel promising strategies to engineer plant cell walls for improved biomass processing.
