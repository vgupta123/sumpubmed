BACKGROUND
coordinated through a complex network of kinases and phosphatases, protein phosphorylation regulates essentially all cellular processes in eukaryotes. recent advances in proteomics enable detection of thousands of phosphorylation sites  in single experiments. however, functionality of the vast majority of these sites remains unclear and we lack suitable approaches to evaluate functional relevance at a pace that matches their detection.


RESULTS
here, we assess functionality of  <dig> phosphosites by introducing phosphodeletion and phosphomimic mutations in  <dig> metabolic enzymes and regulators from the tor and hog signaling pathway in saccharomyces cerevisiae by phenotypic analysis and untargeted metabolomics. we show that metabolomics largely outperforms growth analysis and recovers  <dig> out of the  <dig> previously characterized phosphosites and suggests functionality for several novel sites, including s <dig> on the tor regulatory protein tip <dig>  we analyze metabolic profiles to identify consequences underlying regulatory phosphorylation events and detecting glycerol metabolism to have a so far unknown influence on arginine metabolism via phosphoregulation of the glycerol dehydrogenases. further, we also find s <dig> in the mapkk pbs <dig> as a potential link for cross-talking between hog signaling and the cell wall integrity pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that metabolic profiles can be exploited for gaining insight into regulatory consequences and biological roles of phosphosites. altogether, untargeted metabolomics is a fast, sensitive and informative approach appropriate for future large-scale functional analyses of phosphosites.
