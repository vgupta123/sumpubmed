BACKGROUND
cyclin-dependent kinases  are crucial regulators of cell cycle progression in eukaryotes. the diatom cdka <dig> was originally assigned to the classical a-type cdks, but its cell cycle phase-specific transcription at the g2-to-m phase transition is typical for plant-specific b-type cdks.


RESULTS
here, we report the functional characterization of cdka <dig> from the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum. through a yeast two-hybrid library screen, cdka <dig> was found to interact with the g2/m-specific cdk scaffolding factor cks <dig>  localization of cdka <dig> was found to be nuclear in interphase cells, while in cells undergoing cytokinesis, the signal extended to the cell division plane. in addition, overexpression of cdka <dig> induced an overall reduction in the cell growth rate. expression analysis of cell cycle marker genes in the overexpression lines indicates that this growth reduction is primarily due to a prolongation of the mitotic phase.


CONCLUSIONS
our study indicates a role for cdka <dig> during cell division in diatoms. the functional characterization of a cdk with clear cdkb properties in a non-green organism questions whether the current definition of b-type cdks being plant-specific might need revision.
