BACKGROUND
centromeric dna sequences alone are neither necessary nor sufficient for centromere specification. the centromere specific histone, cenh <dig>  evolves rapidly in many species, perhaps as a coevolutionary response to rapidly evolving centromeric dna. to gain insight into cenh <dig> evolution, we characterized patterns of nucleotide and protein diversity among diploids and allopolyploids within three diverse angiosperm genera, brassica, oryza, and gossypium , with a focus on evidence for diversifying selection in the various domains of the cenh <dig> gene. in addition, we compare expression profiles and alternative splicing patterns for cenh <dig> in representatives of each genus.


RESULTS
all three genera retain both duplicated cenh <dig> copies, while brassica and gossypium exhibit pronounced homoeologous expression level bias. comparisons among genera reveal shared and unique aspects of cenh <dig> evolution, variable levels of diversifying selection in different cenh <dig> domains, and that alternative splicing contributes significantly to cenh <dig> diversity.


CONCLUSIONS
since the n terminus is subject to diversifying selection but the dna binding domains do not appear to be, rapidly evolving centromere sequences are unlikely to be the primary driver of cenh <dig> sequence diversification. at present, the functional explanation for the diversity generated by both conventional protein evolution in the n terminal domain, as well as alternative splicing, remains unexplained.
