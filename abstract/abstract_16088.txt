BACKGROUND
meiotic cells undergo two rounds of nuclear division and generate gametes. previous studies have indicated that a number of transcription factors modulate the transcriptome in successive waves during meiosis and spore formation in fission yeast. however, the mechanisms underlying the post-transcriptional regulation in meiosis are not fully understood. the fission yeast spo5
+
 gene encodes a meiosis-specific rna-binding protein, which is required for the progression of meiosis ii and spore formation. however, the target rna molecules of spo <dig> are yet to be identified. characterization of meiosis-specific rna-binding proteins will provide insight into how post-transcriptional regulation influence gene expression during sexual differentiation.


RESULTS
to assess the functional significance of rna-recognition motifs  of spo <dig>  we constructed a series of new spo <dig> truncated mutants and previously reported spo <dig> missense mutants. in addition, we isolated novel spo <dig> missense mutants. the phenotypic characteristics of these mutants indicated that the rrms are essential for both the localization and function of the protein. interestingly, spo <dig> is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm via the rae1-dependent mrna export pathway, but is unlikely to be involved in global mrna export. furthermore, cytoplasmic localization of spo <dig> is important for its function, which suggests the involvement of spo <dig> in post-transcriptional regulation. we identified pcr1
+
 mrna as one of the critical targets of spo <dig>  the pcr1
+
 gene encodes an activating transcription factor/camp response element binding  transcription factor family. among the four family members, namely pcr <dig>  atf <dig>  atf <dig>  and atf <dig>  only the mrna encoding pcr <dig> binds to spo <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
spo <dig> is exported from the nucleus with mrnas via the rae1-dependent pathway. rrms are necessary for this process and also for the function of spo <dig> after the nuclear export. spo <dig> appears to influence the activity of pcr1
+
 mrna, and the mechanism of how spo <dig> stimulates the mrna to promote the progression of meiosis ii and spore formation remains an intriguing question for future research.
