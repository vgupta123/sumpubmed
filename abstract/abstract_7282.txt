BACKGROUND
the human waking eeg spectrum shows high heritability and stability and, despite maturational cortical changes, high test-retest reliability in children and teens. these phenomena have also been shown to be region specific. we examined the stability of the morphology of the wake eeg spectrum in children aged  <dig> to  <dig> years recorded over weekly intervals and assessed whether the waking eeg spectrum in children may also be trait-like. three minutes of eyes open and three minutes of eyes closed waking eeg was recorded in  <dig> healthy children once a week for three consecutive weeks. eyes open and closed eeg power density spectra were calculated for two central  and two occipital  derivations. a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to determine whether the morphology of the waking eeg spectrum between  <dig> and  <dig> hz is trait-like. we also examined the stability of the alpha peak using an anova.


RESULTS
the morphology of the eeg spectrum recorded from central derivations was highly stable and unique to an individual , while the eeg recorded from occipital derivations, while stable, was much less unique across individuals . furthermore, our analysis revealed an increase in alpha peak height concurrent with a decline in the frequency of the alpha peak across weeks for occipital derivations. no changes in either measure were observed in the central derivations.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that across weekly recordings, power spectra at central derivations exhibit more “trait-like” characteristics than occipital derivations. these results may be relevant for future studies searching for links between phenotypes, such as psychiatric diagnoses, and the underlying genes  by suggesting that such studies should make use of more anterior rather than posterior eeg derivations.
