BACKGROUND
laccases have huge potential for biotechnological applications due to their broad substrate spectrum and wide range of reactions they are able to catalyze. these include, for example, the formation and degradation of dimers, oligomers, polymers, and ring cleavage as well as oxidation of aromatic compounds. potential applications of laccases include detoxification of industrial effluents, decolorization of textile dyes and the synthesis of natural products by, for instance, dimerization of phenolic acids. we have recently published a report on the cloning and characterization of a cota bacillus licheniformis laccase, an enzyme that catalyzes dimerization of phenolic acids. however, the broad application of this laccase is limited by its low expression level of  <dig> mg l- <dig> that was achieved in escherichia coli. to counteract this shortcoming, random and site-directed mutagenesis have been combined in order to improve functional expression and activity of cota.


RESULTS
a cota double mutant, k316n/d500g, was constructed by combining random and site-directed mutagenesis. it can be functionally expressed at an  <dig> -fold higher level than the wild-type enzyme. in addition, it is able to convert ferulic acid much faster than the wild-type enzyme  and is far more efficient in decolorizing a range of industrial dyes. the investigation of the effects of the mutations k316n and d500g showed that amino acid at position  <dig> had a major influence on enzyme activity and position  <dig> had a major influence on the expression of the laccase.


CONCLUSIONS
the constructed double mutant k316n/d500g of the bacillus licheniformis cota laccase is an appropriate candidate for biotechnological applications due to its high expression level and high activity in dimerization of phenolic acids and decolorization of industrial dyes.
