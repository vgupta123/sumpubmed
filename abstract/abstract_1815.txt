BACKGROUND
pre-mrna splicing involves the stepwise assembly of a pre-catalytic spliceosome, followed by its catalytic activation, splicing catalysis and disassembly. formation of the pre-catalytic spliceosomal b complex involves the incorporation of the u4/u <dig> u <dig> tri-snrnp and of a group of non-snrnp b-specific proteins. while in saccharomyces cerevisiae the prp <dig> and snu <dig> proteins are recruited as components of the tri-snrnp, metazoan orthologs of prp <dig> and snu <dig> associate independently of the tri-snrnp as members of the b-specific proteins. the human spliceosome contains about  <dig> proteins that lack obvious orthologs in yeast, including most of the b-specific proteins apart from prp <dig> and snu <dig>  conversely, the tri-snrnp protein spp <dig> is one of only five s. cerevisiae splicing factors without a known human ortholog.


RESULTS
using inparanoid, a state-of-the-art method for ortholog inference between pairs of species, and systematic blast searches we identified the human b-specific protein mfap <dig> as a putative ortholog of the s. cerevisiae tri-snrnp protein spp <dig>  bioinformatics revealed that mfap <dig> and spp <dig> share characteristic structural features, including intrinsic disorder, an elongated shape, solvent exposure of most residues and a trend to adopt α-helical structures. in vitro binding studies showed that human mfap <dig> and yeast spp <dig> bind their respective prp <dig> proteins via equivalent interfaces and that they cross-interact with the prp <dig> proteins of the respective other species. furthermore, mfap <dig> and spp <dig> both form higher-order complexes that additionally include snu <dig>  suggesting that they are parts of equivalent spliceosomal sub-complexes. finally, similar to yeast spp <dig>  human mfap <dig> partially rescued a growth defect of the temperature-sensitive mutant yeast strain prp38- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
human b-specific protein mfap <dig> structurally and functionally resembles the yeast tri-snrnp-specific protein spp <dig> and thus qualifies as its so far missing ortholog. our study indicates that the yeast snu23-prp38-spp <dig> triple complex was evolutionarily reprogrammed from a tri-snrnp-specific module in yeast to the b-specific snu23-prp38-mfap <dig> module in metazoa, affording higher flexibility in spliceosome assembly and thus, presumably, in splicing regulation.
