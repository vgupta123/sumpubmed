BACKGROUND
bacterial load quantification is a critical component of bacterial community analysis, but a culture-independent method capable of detecting and quantifying diverse bacteria is needed. based on our analysis of a diverse collection of 16 s rrna gene sequences, we designed a broad-coverage quantitative real-time pcr  assay—bactquant—for quantifying 16 s rrna gene copy number and estimating bacterial load. we further utilized in silico evaluation to complement laboratory-based qpcr characterization to validate bactquant.

methods
the aligned core set of  <dig>  16 s rrna gene sequences in the greengenes database were analyzed for assay design. cloned plasmid standards were generated and quantified using a qpcr-based approach. coverage analysis was performed computationally using > <dig>  sequences and further evaluated following the minimum information for publication of quantitative real-time pcr experiments  guidelines.


RESULTS
a bacterial taqman® qpcr assay targeting a 466 bp region in v3-v <dig> was designed. coverage analysis showed that 91% of the phyla, 96% of the genera, and >80% of the  <dig>  species analyzed contained at least one perfect sequence match to the bactquant assay. of the  <dig> bacterial species evaluated, amplification efficiencies ranged from  <dig> to 120%, with r2-value of > <dig> , including species with sequence mismatches. inter- and intra-run coefficient of variance was <3% and <16% for ct and copy number, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the bactquant assay offers significantly broader coverage than a previously reported universal bacterial quantification assay bactquant in vitro performance was better than the in silico predictions.
