BACKGROUND
the reca/rad <dig> gene family encodes a diverse set of recombinase proteins that affect homologous recombination, dna-repair, and genome stability. the reca gene family is expressed across all three domains of life - eubacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes - and even in some viruses. to date, efforts to resolve the deep evolutionary origins of this ancient protein family have been hindered by the high sequence divergence between paralogous groups .


RESULTS
through large taxon sampling and the use of a phylogenetic algorithm designed for inferring evolutionary events in highly divergent paralogs, we obtained a robust, parsimonious and more refined phylogenetic history of the reca/rad <dig> superfamily.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our model for the evolution of reca/rad <dig> family provides a better understanding of the ancient origin of reca proteins and the multiple events that lead to the diversification of reca homologs in eukaryotes, including the discovery of additional rad <dig> sub-families.
