BACKGROUND
transglutaminases , which are synthesized as a zymogen  in streptomyces sp., are important enzymes in the food industry. because this pro-peptide is essential for the correct folding of streptomyces tgase, tgase is usually expressed in an inactive pro-tgase form, which is then converted to active tgase by the addition of activating proteases in vitro. in this study, streptomyces hygroscopicus tgase was actively produced by streptomyces lividans through promoter engineering and codon optimization.


RESULTS
a gene fragment  that encoded the pro-tgase and its endogenous promoter region, signal peptide and terminator was amplified from s. hygroscopicus wsh03- <dig> and cloned into plasmid pij <dig>  which resulted in pij86/tg <dig>  after fermentation for 2 days, s. lividans tk <dig> that harbored pij86/tg <dig> produced  <dig>  u/ml of tgase, and a clear tgase band  was detected in the culture supernatant. these results indicated that the pro-tgase was successfully expressed and correctly processed into active tgase in s. lividans tk <dig> by using the tgase promoter. based on deletion analysis, the complete sequence of the tgase promoter is restricted to the region from − <dig> to − <dig>  we also identified a negative element  in the tgase promoter, and the deletion of this element increased the tgase production by  <dig>  %, in contrast to the method by which s. lividans expresses pij86/tg <dig>  combining the deletion of the negative element of the promoter and optimization of the gene codons, the yield and productivity of tgase reached  <dig>  u/ml and  <dig>  u/ml/h in the recombinant s. lividans, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
we constructed an active tgase-producing strain that had a high yield and productivity, and the optimized tgase promoter could be a good candidate promoter for the expression of other proteins in streptomyces.
