BACKGROUND
gene gain and loss frequently occurs in the cyanobacterium prochlorococcus, a phototroph that numerically dominates tropical and subtropical open oceans. however, little is known about the stabilization of its core genome, which contains approximately  <dig> genes, in the context of genome streamlining. using prochlorococcus med <dig> as a model organism, we investigated the constraints on core genome stabilization using transcriptome profiling.


RESULTS
rna-seq technique was used to obtain the transcriptome map of prochlorococcus med <dig>  including operons, untranslated regions, non-coding rnas, and novel genes. genome-wide expression profiles revealed that three factors contribute to core genome stabilization. first, a negative correlation between gene expression levels and protein evolutionary rates was observed. highly expressed genes were overrepresented in the core genome but not in the flexible genome. gene necessity was determined as a second powerful constraint on genome evolution through functional enrichment analysis. third, quick mrna turnover may increase corresponding proteinsâ€™ fidelity among genes that were abundantly expressed. together, these factors influence core genome stabilization during med <dig> genome evolution.


CONCLUSIONS
gene expression, gene necessity, and mrna turnover contribute to core genome maintenance during cyanobacterium prochlorococcus genus evolution.
