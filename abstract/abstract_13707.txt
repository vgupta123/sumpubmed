BACKGROUND
progress in the fields of protein separation and identification technologies has accelerated research into biofluids proteomics for protein biomarker discovery. urine has become an ideal and rich source of biomarkers in clinical proteomics. here we performed a proteomic analysis of urine samples from pregnant and non-pregnant patients using gel electrophoresis and high-resolution mass spectrometry. furthermore, we also apply a non-prefractionation quantitative phosphoproteomic approach using mtraq labeling to evaluate the expression of specific phosphoproteins during pregnancy comparison with non-pregnancy.


RESULTS
in total,  <dig> proteins  were identified, including  <dig> from the urine of pregnant volunteers and  <dig> from the urine of non-pregnant volunteers. one thousand and twenty-three proteins were not reported in previous studies at the proteome level and were unique to our study. furthermore, we obtained  <dig> phosphopeptides, representing  <dig> phosphoproteins. among these phosphoproteins,  <dig> of them were found to be significantly differentially expressed, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and two were down-regulated in urine samples from women just before vaginal delivery.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these results offer a comprehensive urinary proteomic profile of healthy women during before and after vaginal delivery and novel information on the phosphoproteins that are differentially regulated during the maintenance of normal pregnancy. our results may provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of pregnancy maintenance, potentially leading to the development of biomarker-based sensitive assays for understanding pregnancy.
