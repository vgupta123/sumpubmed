BACKGROUND
russian republic of karelia is located at the russian-finnish border. it contains most of the historical karelia land inhabited with autochthonous karels and more recently migrated russians. although tuberculosis  incidence in karelia is decreasing, it remains high  with the rate of multi-drug resistance  among newly diagnosed tb patients reaching  <dig>  %. the study aimed to genetically characterize mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates obtained at different time points from tb patients from karelia to gain insight into the phylogeographic specificity of the circulating genotypes and to assess trends in evolution of drug resistant subpopulations.

methods
the sample included 150 m. tuberculosis isolates:  <dig> isolated in 2013– <dig>  and  <dig> isolated in  <dig> . drug susceptibility testing was done by the method of absolute concentrations. spoligotyping was used to test genotype-specific markers of a latin-american-mediterranean  family and its sublineages as well as a beijing b0/w148-cluster.


RESULTS
the largest spoligotypes were sit <dig>  and sit <dig> . beijing family was the largest  followed by t , ural  and lam . successful russian clone, beijing В0/w <dig>  was identified in  <dig>  of  <dig> beijing isolates; all В0/w <dig> isolates were drug-resistant. seven of  <dig> lam isolates belonged to the rd115/lam-rus branch,  <dig> - to the lam rd174/rd-rio sublineage. mdr was found in beijing , ural , and lam . in contrast, all t isolates were pansusceptible. comparison of drug resistant subgroups of the new and old collections showed an increasing prevalence of the b0/w <dig> clonal cluster, from  <dig>  %  in  <dig> to  <dig>  % in  <dig> . the west–east increasing gradient is observed for the ural genotype that may be defined a ‘russian’ strain. in contrast, the spoligotype sit <dig> of the t family appears to be a historical karelian strain.


CONCLUSIONS
circulation of the mdr m. tuberculosis isolates of the beijing genotype and its b0/w <dig> cluster continues to critically influence the current situation with the mdr-tb control in northwestern russia including the republic of karelia. revealed phylogeographic patterns of some genotypes reflect a complex demographic history of karelia within the course of the 20th century.
