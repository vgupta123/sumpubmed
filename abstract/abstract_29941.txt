BACKGROUND
spaceflight environment have been shown to generate reactive oxygen species  and induce oxidative stress in plants, but little is known about the gene expression of the ros gene network in plants grown in long-term spaceflight. the molecular response and adaptation to the spaceflight environment of mizuna plants harvested after  <dig> days of cultivation onboard the international space station  were measured using genome-wide mrna expression analysis .


RESULTS
total reads of transcripts from the mizuna grown in the iss as well as on the ground by mrna-seq showed  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in the space-grown mizuna when compared with those from the ground-grown mizuna. a total of  <dig> in  <dig> ros oxidative marker genes were up-regulated, including high expression of four hallmarks, and preferentially expressed genes associated with ros-scavenging including thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, and alternative oxidase genes. in the transcription factors of the ros gene network, mekk1-mkk4-mpk <dig>  oxi1-mkk4-mpk <dig>  and oxi1-mpk <dig> of map cascades, induction of wrky <dig> by mekk1-mkk4-mpk <dig> cascade, induction of wrky <dig> and repression of zat <dig> by zat <dig> were suggested. rbohd and rbohf genes were up-regulated preferentially in nadph oxidase genes, which produce ros.


CONCLUSIONS
this large-scale transcriptome analysis revealed that the spaceflight environment induced oxidative stress and the ros gene network activation in the space-grown mizuna. among transcripts altered in expression by space conditions, some were common genes response to abiotic and biotic stress. furthermore, certain genes were exclusively up-regulated in mizuna grown on the iss. surprisingly, mizuna grew in space normally, as well as on the ground, demonstrating that plants can acclimate to long-term exposure in the spaceflight environment by reprogramming the expression of the ros gene network.
