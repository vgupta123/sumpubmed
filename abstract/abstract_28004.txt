BACKGROUND
rt-qpcr is a preferred method for rapid and reliable quantification of gene expression studies. appropriate application of rt-qpcr in such studies requires the use of reference gene as an internal control to normalize mrna levels between different samples for an exact comparison of gene expression level. however, recent studies have shown that no single reference gene is universal for all experiments. thus, the identification of high quality reference gene is of paramount importance for the interpretation of data generated by rt-qpcr. only a few studies on reference genes have been done in plants and none in peach . therefore, the present study was conducted to identify suitable reference gene for normalization of gene expression in peach.


RESULTS
in this work, eleven reference genes were investigated in different peach samples using rt-qpcr with sybr green. these genes are: actin 2/ <dig> , cyclophilin , rna polymerase ii , phospholipase a <dig> , ribosomal protein l <dig> , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , 18s ribosomal rna , tubblin beta , tubblin alpha , translation elongation factor  <dig>  and ubiquitin  <dig> . all eleven reference genes displayed a wide range of cq values in all samples, indicating that they expressed variably. the stability of these genes except for rpl <dig> was determined by three different descriptive statistics, genorm, normfinder and bestkeeper, which produced highly comparable results.


CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates that expression stability varied greatly between genes studied in peach. based on the results from genorm, normfinder and bestkeeper analyses, for all the sample pools analyzed, tef <dig>  ubq <dig> and rp ii were found to be the most suitable reference genes with a very high statistical reliability, and tef <dig> and rp ii for the other sample series, while 18s rrna, rpl <dig> and pla <dig> were unsuitable as internal controls. gapdh and act also performed poorly and were less stable in our analysis. to achieve accurate comparison of levels of gene expression, two or more reference genes must be used for data normalization. the combinations of tef2/ubq10/rp ii and tef2/rp ii were suggested for use in all samples and subsets, respectively.
