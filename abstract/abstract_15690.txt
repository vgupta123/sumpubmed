BACKGROUND
e. histolytica, a pathogenic amoeba, is indistinguishable in its cyst and trophozoite stages from those of non-pathogenic e. moshkovskii and e. dispar by light microscopy. we have developed a nested multiplex pcr targeting a 16s-like rrna gene for differential detection of all the three morphologically similar forms of e. histolytica, e. moshkovskii and e. dispar simultaneously in stool samples.


RESULTS
the species specific product size for e. histolytica, e. moshkovskii and e. dispar was  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp respectively, which was clearly different for all the three entamoeba species. the nested multiplex pcr showed a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 100% for the demonstration of e. histolytica, e. moshkovskii and e. dispar dna in stool samples. the pcr was positive for e. histolytica, e. moshkovskii and e. dispar in a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> stool specimens  that were positive for e. histolytica/e. dispar/e. moshkovskii by examination of stool by microscopy and/or culture. all the  <dig> negative control stool samples that were negative for e. histolytica/e. dispar/e. moshkovskii by microscopy and culture were also found negative by the nested multiplex pcr . the result from the study shows that only  <dig> % of the patient stool samples that were positive for e. histolytica/e. dispar/e. moshkovskii by examination of stool by microscopy and/or culture, were actually positive for pathogenic e. histolytica and the remaining majority of the stool samples were positive for non-pathogenic e. dispar or e. moshkovskii as demonstrated by the use of nested multiplex pcr.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study reports a new nested multiplex pcr strategy for species specific detection and differentiation of e. histolytica, e. dispar and e. moshkovskii dna in stool specimens. the test is highly specific, sensitive and also rapid, providing the results within  <dig> hours of receiving stool specimens.
