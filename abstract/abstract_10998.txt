BACKGROUND
emerging evidence suggests that ecological heterogeneity across space can influence the genetic structure of populations, including that of long-distance dispersers such as large carnivores. on the central coast of british columbia, canada, wolf  dietary niche and parasite prevalence data indicate strong ecological divergence between marine-oriented wolves inhabiting islands and individuals on the coastal mainland that interact primarily with terrestrial prey. local holders of traditional ecological knowledge, who distinguish between mainland and island wolf forms, also informed our hypothesis that genetic differentiation might occur between wolves from these adjacent environments.


RESULTS
we used microsatellite genetic markers to examine data obtained from wolf faecal samples. our results from  <dig> individuals suggest the presence of a genetic cline between mainland and island wolves. this pattern occurs despite field observations that individuals easily traverse the 30 km wide study area and swim up to 13 km among landmasses in the region.


CONCLUSIONS
natal habitat-biased dispersal  might contribute to genetic differentiation. accordingly, this working hypothesis presents an exciting avenue for future research where marine resources or other components of ecological heterogeneity are present.
