BACKGROUND
intron gains reportedly are very rare during evolution of vertebrates, and the mechanisms underlying their creation are largely unknown. previous investigations have shown that, during metazoan radiation, the exon-intron patterns of serpin superfamily genes were subject to massive changes, in contrast to many other genes.


RESULTS
here we investigated intron dynamics in the serpin superfamily in lineages pre- and postdating the split of vertebrates. multiple intron gains were detected in a group of ray-finned fishes, once the canonical groups of vertebrate serpins had been established. in two genes, co-occurrence of non-standard introns was observed, implying that intron gains in vertebrates may even happen concomitantly or in a rapidly consecutive manner. dna breakage/repair processes associated with genome compaction are introduced as a novel factor potentially favoring intron gain, since all non-canonical introns were found in a lineage of ray-finned fishes that experienced genomic downsizing.


CONCLUSIONS
multiple intron acquisitions were identified in serpin genes of a lineage of ray-finned fishes, but not in any other vertebrates, suggesting that insertion rates for introns may be episodically increased. the co-occurrence of non-standard introns within the same gene discloses the possibility that introns may be gained simultaneously. the sequences flanking the intron insertion points correspond to the proto-splice site consensus sequence magâ†‘n, previously proposed to serve as intron insertion site. the association of intron gains in the serpin superfamily with a group of fishes that underwent genome compaction may indicate that dna breakage/repair processes might foster intron birth.
