BACKGROUND
a nitrilase-mediated pathway has significant advantages in the production of optically pure --mandelic acid. however, unwanted byproduct, low enantioselectivity, and specific activity reduce its value in practical applications. an ideal nitrilase that can efficiently hydrolyze mandelonitrile to optically pure --mandelic acid without the unwanted byproduct is needed.


RESULTS
a novel nitrilase  was discovered from burkholderia cenocepacia j <dig> through phylogeny-based enzymatic substrate specificity prediction . this nitrilase is a mandelonitrile hydrolase that could efficiently hydrolyze mandelonitrile to --mandelic acid, with a high enantiomeric excess of  <dig> %. no byproduct was observed in this hydrolysis process. bcj <dig> showed the highest identity of 71% compared with other nitrilases in the amino acid sequence. bcj <dig> possessed the highest activity toward mandelonitrile and took mandelonitrile as the optimal substrate based on the analysis of substrate specificity. the kinetic parameters vmax, km, kcat, and kcat/km toward mandelonitrile were  <dig>  μmol/min/mg,  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  s- <dig>  and  <dig> × <dig> m-1s- <dig>  respectively. the recombinant escherichia coli m15/bcj <dig> had a strong substrate tolerance and could completely hydrolyze mandelonitrile  with fewer amounts of wet cells  within  <dig> h.


CONCLUSIONS
pessp is an efficient method for discovering an ideal mandelonitrile hydrolase. bcj <dig> has high affinity and catalytic efficiency toward mandelonitrile. this nitrilase has great advantages in the production of optically pure --mandelic acid because of its high activity and enantioselectivity, strong substrate tolerance, and having no unwanted byproduct. thus, bcj <dig> has great potential in the practical production of optically pure --mandelic acid in the industry.
