BACKGROUND
in interphase nuclei of a wide range of species chromosomes are organised into their own specific locations termed territories. these chromosome territories are non-randomly positioned in nuclei which is believed to be related to a spatial aspect of regulatory control over gene expression. in this study we have adopted the pig as a model in which to study interphase chromosome positioning and follows on from other studies from our group of using pig cells and tissues to study interphase genome re-positioning during differentiation. the pig is an important model organism both economically and as a closely related species to study human disease models. this is why great efforts have been made to accomplish the full genome sequence in the last decade.


RESULTS
this study has positioned most of the porcine chromosomes in in vitro cultured adult and embryonic fibroblasts, early passage stromal derived mesenchymal stem cells and lymphocytes. the study is further expanded to position four chromosomes in ex vivo tissue derived from pig kidney, lung and brain.


CONCLUSIONS
it was concluded that porcine chromosomes are also non-randomly positioned within interphase nuclei with few major differences in chromosome position in interphase nuclei between different cell and tissue types. there were also no differences between preferred nuclear location of chromosomes in in vitro cultured cells as compared to cells in tissue sections. using a number of analyses to ascertain by what criteria porcine chromosomes were positioned in interphase nuclei; we found a correlation with dna content.
