BACKGROUND
bone morphogenetic proteins regulate multiple processes in embryonic development, including early dorso-ventral patterning and neural crest development. bmps activate heteromeric receptor complexes consisting of type i and type ii receptor-serine/threonine kinases. bmp receptors ia and ib, also known as alk <dig> and alk <dig> respectively, are the most common type i receptors that likely mediate most bmp signaling events. since early expression patterns and functions in xenopus laevis development have not been described, we have addressed these questions in the present study.


RESULTS
here we have analyzed the temporal and spatial expression patterns of alk <dig> and alk6; we have also carried out loss-of-function studies to define the function of these receptors in early xenopus development. we detected both redundant and non-redundant roles of alk <dig> and alk <dig> in dorso-ventral patterning. from late gastrula stages onwards, their expression patterns diverged, which correlated with a specific, non-redundant requirement of alk <dig> in post-gastrula neural crest cells. alk <dig> was essential for induction of neural crest cell fate and further development of the neural crest and its derivatives.


CONCLUSIONS
alk <dig> and alk <dig> both contribute to the gene regulatory network that regulates dorso-ventral patterning; they play partially overlapping and partially non-redundant roles in this process. alk <dig> and alk <dig> are independently required for the spatially restricted activation of bmp signaling and msx <dig> upregulation at the neural plate border, whereas in post-gastrula development alk <dig> exerts a highly specific, conserved function in neural crest development.
