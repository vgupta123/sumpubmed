BACKGROUND
the nasal tissue uptake and metabolism of ciclesonide, a new-generation corticosteroid under investigation for treatment of allergic rhinitis, to its active metabolite, desisobutyryl-ciclesonide , was evaluated when administered to rabbits in a hypotonic versus an isotonic ciclesonide suspension. nasal mucosa extracts from normal japanese white rabbits were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection after a single 143-Î¼g dose of ciclesonide. retention and formation of fatty acid conjugates of des-cic were also measured in nasal mucosa extracts postadministration of a hypotonic ciclesonide suspension .


RESULTS
versus an isotonic suspension, the hypotonic suspension achieved higher concentrations of des-cic  and ciclesonide  at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> min postadministration. additionally, when administered via a hypotonic suspension, des-cic was retained up to  <dig> h postadministration . highest concentration of major fatty acid ester conjugate, des-cic-oleate, was detected in nasal mucosa at  <dig> h postadministration.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that a hypotonic ciclesonide suspension provides higher intracellular concentrations of des-cic up to  <dig> h, thereby providing a rationale for investigation of ciclesonide as a convenient once-daily nasal spray for treatment of allergic rhinitis.
