BACKGROUND
using genome-wide genetic, gene expression, and microrna expression  data, we developed an integrative approach to investigate the genetic and epigenetic basis of chemotherapeutic sensitivity.


RESULTS
through a sequential multi-stage framework, we identified genes and mirnas whose expression correlated with platinum sensitivity, mapped these to genomic loci as quantitative trait loci , and evaluated the associations between these qtls and platinum sensitivity. a permutation analysis showed that top findings from our approach have a much lower false discovery rate compared to those from a traditional gwas of drug sensitivity. our approach identified five snps associated with  <dig> mirnas and the expression level of  <dig> genes, all of which were associated with carboplatin sensitivity. of particular interest was one snp , which was associated with the expression of both mir-30d and the gene abcd <dig>  which were themselves correlated with both carboplatin and cisplatin drug-specific phenotype in the hapmap samples. functional study found that knocking down abcd <dig> in vitro led to increased apoptosis in ovarian cancer cell line skov <dig> after cisplatin treatment. over-expression of mir-30d in vitro caused a decrease in abcd <dig> expression, suggesting a functional relationship between the two.


CONCLUSIONS
we developed an integrative approach to the investigation of the genetic and epigenetic basis of human complex traits. our approach outperformed standard gwas and provided hints at potential biological function. the relationships between abcd <dig> and mir-30d, and abcd <dig> and platin sensitivity were experimentally validated, suggesting a functional role of abcd <dig> and mir-30d in sensitivity to platinating agents.
