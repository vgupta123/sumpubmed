BACKGROUND
the root apical meristem of crop and model legume medicago truncatula is a significantly different stem cell system to that of the widely studied model plant species arabidopsis thaliana. in this study we used the affymetrix medicago genechipÂ® to compare the transcriptomes of meristem and non-meristematic root to identify root meristem specific candidate genes.


RESULTS
using mrna from root meristem and non-meristem we were able to identify  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts differentially expressed from the two regions. with bioinformatics tools developed to functionally annotate the medicago genome array we could identify significant changes in metabolism, signalling and the differentially expression of  <dig> transcription factors in meristematic and non-meristematic roots.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first comprehensive analysis of m. truncatula root meristem cells using this genome array. this data will facilitate the mapping of regulatory and metabolic networks involved in the open root meristem of m. truncatula and provides candidates for functional analysis.
