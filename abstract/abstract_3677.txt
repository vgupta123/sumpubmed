BACKGROUND
the impact of infections with the human cytomegalovirus  for the development of atherosclerosis and restenosis is still unclear. both a clear correlation and no correlation at all have been reported in clinical, mostly serological studies. in our study we employed a human non-injury ex vivo organ culture model to investigate the effect of an in vitro permissive hcmv-infection on cell proliferation and neointimal hyperplasia for a period of  <dig> days.


RESULTS
during routine-nephrectomies parts of renal arteries from  <dig> patients were obtained and prepared as human organ cultures. cell free hcmv infection was performed with the fibroblast adapted hcmv strain ad <dig>  the endotheliotropic strain tb40e, and a clinical isolate . after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days in culture staining of hcmv-antigens was carried out and reactive cell proliferation and neointimal thickening were analysed. successful hcmv-infection was accomplished with all three virus strains studied. during the first  <dig> days in organ culture no cell proliferation or neointimal hyperplasia was detected. at day  <dig> and day  <dig> moderate cell proliferation and neointimal hyperplasia was found both in hcmv-infected segments and mock infected controls. neointimal hyperplasia in productively hcmv-infected segments was lower than in non infected at day  <dig> and day  <dig>  but relatively higher after infection with the endotheliotropic tb40e in comparison with the two other strains.


CONCLUSIONS
the data do not support the hypothesis that hcmv-infection triggers restenosis via a stimulatory effect on cell proliferation and neointimal hyperplasia in comparison to non infected controls. interestingly however, even after lytic infection, a virus strain specific difference was observed.
