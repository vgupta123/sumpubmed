BACKGROUND
we have shown previously that pan-hdac inhibitors  m-carboxycinnamic acid bis-hydroxamide  and trichostatin a  attenuated cardiac hypertrophy in balb/c mice by inducing hyper-acetylation of cardiac chromatin that was accompanied by suppression of pro-inflammatory gene networks. however, it was not feasible to determine the precise contribution of the myocytes- and non-myocytes to hdaci-induced gene expression in the intact heart. therefore, the current study was undertaken with a primary goal of elucidating temporal changes in the transcriptomes of cardiac myocytes exposed to cbha and tsa.


RESULTS
we incubated h9c <dig> cardiac myocytes in growth medium containing either of the two hdacis for 6h and 24h and analyzed changes in gene expression using illumina microarrays. h9c <dig> cells exposed to tsa for 6h and 24h led to differential expression of  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. in contrast, cardiac myocytes incubated with cbha for 6h and 24h elicited differential expression of  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. we analyzed cbha- and tsa-induced differentially expressed genes by ingenuity pathway , kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  and core_tf programs and discovered that cbha and tsa impinged on several common gene networks. thus, both hdacis induced a repertoire of signaling kinases  and transcription factors  representing canonical tgfβ, tnf-α, ifnγ and il- <dig> specific networks. an overrepresentation of e2f, ap <dig>  egr <dig> and sp <dig> specific motifs was also found in the promoters of the differentially expressed genes. apparently, tsa elicited predominantly tgfβ- and tnf-α-intensive gene networks regardless of the duration of treatment. in contrast, cbha elicited tnf-α and ifnγ specific networks at  <dig> h, followed by elicitation of il- <dig> and ifnγ-centered gene networks at 24h.


CONCLUSIONS
our data show that both cbha and tsa induced similar, but not identical, time-dependent, gene networks in h9c <dig> cardiac myocytes. initially, both hdacis impinged on numerous genes associated with adipokine signaling, intracellular metabolism and energetics, and cell cycle. a continued exposure to either cbha or tsa led to the emergence of a number of apoptosis- and inflammation-specific gene networks that were apparently suppressed by both hdacis. based on these data we posit that the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative actions of hdacis are myocyte-intrinsic. these findings advance our understanding of the mechanisms of actions of hdacis on cardiac myocytes and reveal potential signaling pathways that may be targeted therapeutically.
