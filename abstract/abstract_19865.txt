BACKGROUND
evidence based on genomic sequences is extremely important to confirm the phylogenetic relationships within the rhizobium group. semia <dig> was analyzed within the mesorhizobium groups to define the underlying causes of taxonomic identification. we previously used biochemical tests and phenotypic taxonomic methods to identify bacteria, which can lead to erroneous classification. an improved understanding of bacterial strains such as the mesorhizobium genus would increase our knowledge of classification and evolution of these species.


RESULTS
in this study, we sequenced the complete genome of semia <dig> and compared it with five other mesorhizobium and two rhizobium genomes. the genomes of isolated semia <dig> showed several orthologs with m. huakuii, m. erdmanii and m. loti. we identified semia <dig> as a mesorhizobium by comparing the 16s rrna gene and the complete genome.


CONCLUSIONS
our ortholog, 16s rrna gene and average nucleotide identity values  analysis all demonstrate semia <dig> is not rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viceae. the results of the phylogenetic analysis clearly show semia <dig> is part of the mesorhizobium group and suggest a reclassification is warranted.
