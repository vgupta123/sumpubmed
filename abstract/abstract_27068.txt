BACKGROUND
implementation of molecular breeding in rye  improvement programs depends on the availability of high-density molecular linkage maps. however, the number of sequence-specific pcr-based markers available for the species is limited. diversity arrays technology  is a microarray-based method allowing for detection of dna polymorphism at several thousand loci in a single assay without relying on dna sequence information. the objective of this study was the development and application of diversity arrays technology for rye.


RESULTS
using the psti/taqi method of complexity reduction we created a rye diversity panel from dna of  <dig> rye varieties and  <dig> rye inbred lines, including parents of a mapping population consisting of  <dig> recombinant inbred lines. the usefulness of a wheat diversity panel for identification of dart markers for rye was also demonstrated. we identified  <dig> clones that were polymorphic in the genotyped ils and varieties and  <dig> clones that differentiated the parental lines l <dig> and l <dig> and segregated in the mapping population. hierarchical clustering and ordination analysis were performed based on the  <dig> dart markers to reveal genetic relationships between the rye varieties and inbred lines included in the study. chromosomal location of  <dig> dart markers was determined using wheat-rye addition lines and  <dig> dart markers  were placed on a genetic linkage map of the cross l <dig> Ã— l <dig>  providing an average density of one unique marker every  <dig>  cm. this is the most saturated rye linkage map based solely on transferable markers available at the moment, providing rye breeders and researches with a better choice of markers and a higher probability of finding polymorphic markers in the region of interest.


CONCLUSIONS
the diversity arrays technology can be efficiently and effectively used for rye genome analyses - assessment of genetic similarity and linkage mapping. the 11520-clone rye genotyping panel with several thousand markers with determined chromosomal location and accessible through an inexpensive genotyping service is a valuable resource for studies on rye genome organization and in molecular breeding of the species.
