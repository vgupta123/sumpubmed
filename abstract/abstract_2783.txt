BACKGROUND
this work tests the hypothesis that increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor  observed during bladder inflammation modulates nerve plasticity.

methods
chronic inflammation was induced by intravesical instillations of bacillus calmette-gu√©rin  into the urinary bladder and the density of nerves expressing the transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily  <dig>  or pan-neuronal marker pgp <dig>  was used to quantify alterations in peripheral nerve plasticity. some mice were treated with b <dig>  a vegf neutralizing antibody to reduce the participation of vegf. additional mice were treated systemically with antibodies engineered to specifically block the binding of vegf to nrp <dig>  and nrp <dig> , or the binding of semaphorins to nrp <dig>  to diminish activity of axon guidance molecules such as neuropilins  and semaphorins . to confirm that vegf is capable of inducing inflammation and neuronal plasticity, another group of mice was instilled with recombinant vegf <dig> or vegf <dig> into the urinary bladder.


RESULTS
the major finding of this work was that chronic bcg instillation resulted in inflammation and an overwhelming increase in both pgp <dig>  and trpv <dig> immunoreactivity, primarily in the sub-urothelium of the urinary bladder. treatment of mice with anti-vegf neutralizing antibody  abolished the effect of bcg on inflammation and nerve density.

nrp1a and nrp1b antibodies, known to reduce bcg-induced inflammation, failed to block bcg-induced increase in nerve fibers. however, the nrp2b antibody dramatically potentiated the effects of bcg in increasing pgp <dig> -, trpv1-, substance p -, and calcitonin gene-related peptide -immunoreactivity . finally, instillation of vegf <dig> or vegf <dig> into the mouse bladder recapitulated the effects of bcg and resulted in a significant inflammation and increase in nerve density.


CONCLUSIONS
for the first time, evidence is being presented supporting that chronic bcg instillation into the mouse bladder promotes a significant increase in peripheral nerve density that was mimicked by vegf instillation. effects of bcg were abolished by pre-treatment with neutralizing vegf antibody. the present results implicate the vegf pathway as a key modulator of inflammation and nerve plasticity, introduces a new animal model for investigation of vegf-induced nerve plasticity, and suggests putative mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.
