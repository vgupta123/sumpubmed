BACKGROUND
atp-binding cassette transporter a <dig>  mediates the lipidation of exchangeable apolipoproteins, the rate-limiting step in the formation of high density lipoproteins . we previously demonstrated that hdl oxidized ex vivo by peroxidase-generated tyrosyl radical  increases the availability of cellular cholesterol for efflux and reduces the development of atherosclerosis when administered to apolipoprotein e-deficient mice as compared to treatment with control hdl.


RESULTS
in the current study we determined that tyrhdl requires functional abca <dig> for this enhanced activity. like lipid-free apolipoprotein a-i , tyrhdl increases total and cell surface abca <dig>  inhibits calpain-dependent and -independent proteolysis of abca <dig>  and can be bound by cell surface abca <dig> in human skin fibroblasts. additionally, tyrhdl apoproteins are susceptible to digestion by enteropeptidase like lipid-free apoa-i, but unlike lipid-bound apoa-i on hdl, which is resistant to proteolysis.


CONCLUSIONS
these results provide the first evidence that lipid-bound apolipoproteins on the surface of spherical hdl particles can behave like lipid-free apoa-i to increase abca <dig> protein levels and activity.
