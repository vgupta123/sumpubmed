BACKGROUND
marine molluscs, as is the case with most aquatic animals, rely heavily on olfactory cues for survival. in the mollusc aplysia californica, mate-attraction is mediated by a blend of water-borne protein pheromones that are detected by sensory structures called rhinophores. the expression of g protein and phospholipase c signaling molecules in this organ is consistent with chemosensory detection being via a g-protein-coupled signaling mechanism.


RESULTS
here we show that novel multi-transmembrane proteins with similarity to rhodopsin g-protein coupled receptors are expressed in sensory epithelia microdissected from the aplysia rhinophore. analysis of the a. californica genome reveals that these are part of larger multigene families that possess features found in metazoan chemosensory receptor families . phylogenetic analyses show that the novel aplysia g-protein coupled receptor-like proteins represent three distinct monophyletic subfamilies. representatives of each subfamily are restricted to or differentially expressed in the rhinophore and oral tentacles, suggesting that they encode functional chemoreceptors and that these olfactory organs sense different chemicals. those expressed in rhinophores may sense water-borne pheromones. secondary signaling component proteins gαq, gαi, and gαo are also expressed in the rhinophore sensory epithelium.


CONCLUSIONS
the novel rhodopsin g-protein coupled receptor-like gene subfamilies identified here do not have closely related identifiable orthologs in other metazoans, suggesting that they arose by a lineage-specific expansion as has been observed in chemosensory receptor families in other bilaterians. these candidate chemosensory receptors are expressed and often restricted to rhinophores and oral tentacles, lending support to the notion that water-borne chemical detection in aplysia involves species- or lineage-specific families of chemosensory receptors.
