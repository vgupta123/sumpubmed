BACKGROUND
experimental verification of gene products has not kept pace with the rapid growth of microbial sequence information. however, existing annotations of gene locations contain sufficient information to screen for probable errors. furthermore, comparisons among genomes become more informative as more genomes are examined. we studied all open reading frames  of at least  <dig> codons from the genomes of  <dig> sequenced bacterial strains. we grouped the potential peptide sequences encoded from the orfs by forming clusters of orthologous groups . we used this grouping in order to find homologous relationships that would not be distinguishable from noise when using simple blast searches. although cog analysis was initially developed to group annotated genes, we applied it to the task of grouping anonymous dna sequences that may encode proteins.


RESULTS
"mixed cogs" of orfs  are attractive targets when seeking errors of gene predicion. examination of mixed cogs reveals some situations in which genes appear to have been missed in current annotations and a smaller number of regions that appear to have been annotated as gene loci erroneously. this technique can also be used to detect potential pseudogenes or sequencing errors. our method uses an adjustable parameter for degree of conservation among the studied genomes . we detail results for one level of stringency at which we found  <dig> potential genes which had not previously been identified,  <dig> potential pseudogenes, and  <dig> sequences with existing gene annotations that are probably incorrect.


CONCLUSIONS
systematic study of sequence conservation offers a way to improve existing annotations by identifying potentially homologous regions where the annotation of the presence or absence of a gene is inconsistent among genomes.
