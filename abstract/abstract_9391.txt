BACKGROUND
single nucleotide polymorphisms  are increasingly becoming the dna marker system of choice due to their prevalence in the genome and their ability to be used in highly multiplexed genotyping assays. although needed in high numbers for genome-wide marker profiles and genomics-assisted breeding, a surprisingly low number of validated snps are currently available for perennial ryegrass.


RESULTS
a perennial ryegrass unigene set representing  <dig>  genes was used as a reference for the assembly of  <dig>  high quality reads generated by  <dig> transcriptome sequencing and for in silico snp discovery. out of more than  <dig>  snps in  <dig>  unigenes fulfilling highly stringent assembly and detection parameters, a total of  <dig> snp markers were selected for goldengate genotyping in  <dig> individuals of the perennial ryegrass mapping population vrna, a population being previously evaluated for important agronomic traits. a total of  <dig>  of the snps tested were successfully called with a cluster separation above  <dig> . of these,  <dig>  genic snp markers segregated in the vrna mapping population, out of which  <dig> were assigned to map positions. the genetic linkage map presented here comprises a total of  <dig> dna markers  and spans  <dig> centi mogan  with an average marker interval distance of less than  <dig> â€‰cm. moreover, it locates  <dig> expressed genes involved in a broad range of molecular functions of different biological processes in the perennial ryegrass genome.


CONCLUSIONS
here, we present an efficient approach of using next generation sequencing  data for snp discovery, and the successful design of a 768-plex illumina goldengate genotyping assay in a complex genome. the ryegrass snps along with the corresponding transcribed sequences represent a milestone in the establishment of genetic and genomics resources available for this species and constitute a further step towards molecular breeding strategies. moreover, the high density genetic linkage map predominantly based on gene-associated dna markers provides an important tool for the assignment of candidate genes to quantitative trait loci , functional genomics and the integration of genetic and physical maps in perennial ryegrass, one of the most important temperate grassland species.
