BACKGROUND
β-defensins are small, cationic, antimicrobial peptides found in species across the plant and animal kingdoms. in addition to microbiocidal activity, roles in immunity as well as reproduction have more recently been documented. β-defensin genes in ovis aries  have been poorly annotated, having been identified only by automatic gene prediction algorithms. the objective of this study was to use a comparative genomics approach to identify and characterise the β-defensin gene repertoire in sheep using the bovine genome as the primary reference.


RESULTS
all  <dig> currently predicted bovine β-defensin genes were used to find orthologous sequences in the most recent version of the sheep genome . forty three genes were found to have close genomic matches  between sheep and cattle. the orthologous genes were located in four clusters across the genome, with  <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig>  conserved gene order for the β-defensin genes was apparent in the two smaller clusters, although gene order was reversed on chromosome  <dig>  suggesting an inversion between sheep and cattle. complete conservation of gene order was also observed for chromosome  <dig> β-defensin orthologs. more structural differences were apparent between chromosome  <dig> genes and the orthologous region in the bovine reference genome, which is known to be copy-number variable. in this cluster, the defensin-beta  <dig>  gene matched to eleven bovine neutrophil beta-defensin  genes on chromosome  <dig> with almost uniform similarity, as well as to tracheal, enteric and lingual anti-microbial peptides , suggesting that annotation of the bovine reference sequence is still incomplete. qpcr was used to profile the expression of  <dig> β-defensin genes, representing each of the four clusters, in the ram reproductive tract. distinct site-specific and differential expression profiles were detected across the reproductive tract of mature rams with preferential β-defensin gene expression in the epididymis, recapitulating observations for orthologous genes in other species.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first comprehensive analysis of β-defensin genes encoded by the ovine reference sequence, and the first report of an expanded repertoire of β-defensin genes in this species. the preferential expression of these genes in the epididymis suggests a role in fertility, possibly providing immunoprotection for sperm within the female reproductive tract.
