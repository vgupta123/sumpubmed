BACKGROUND
in escherichia coli, approximately  <dig> regulatory small rnas  have been identified experimentally and many more have been predicted by various methods. to provide a comprehensive overview of srnas, we analysed the low-molecular-weight rnas  of e. coli with deep sequencing, because the regulatory rnas in bacteria are usually 50- <dig> nt in length.


RESULTS
we discovered  <dig> novel candidate srnas  with computational or experimental evidence of transcription initiation. among them, the expression of seven intergenic srnas and three cis-antisense srnas was detected by northern blot analysis. interestingly, five novel srnas are expressed from prophage regions and we note that these srnas have several specific characteristics. furthermore, we conducted an evolutionary conservation analysis of the candidate srnas and summarised the data among closely related bacterial strains.


CONCLUSIONS
this comprehensive screen for e. coli srnas using a deep sequencing approach has shown that many as-yet-undiscovered srnas are potentially encoded in the e. coli genome. we constructed the escherichia coli small rna browser , which integrates the data for previously identified srnas and the novel srnas found in this study.
