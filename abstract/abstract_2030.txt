BACKGROUND
mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to neuronal death and a wide array of neurodegenerative diseases. previously, we have shown sex differences in mitochondria-mediated cell death pathways following hypoxia-ischemia. however, the role of mitochondrial biogenesis in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury between male vs. female has not been studied yet.


RESULTS
primary cerebellar granule neurons , isolated from p <dig> male and female mice  segregated based on visual inspection of sex, were exposed to 2 h of oxygen glucose deprivation  followed by 6–24 h of reoxygenation . mitochondrial membrane potential  and cellular atp levels were reduced significantly in xx cgns as compared to xy cgns. mitochondrial dna  content was increased  at 2 h ogd in xy cgns and remained increased up to 24 h of reox compared to xx neurons and normoxia controls. the expression of mitochondrial transcription factor a , the nuclear respiratory factor- <dig>  and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α , a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, were up-regulated  in xy cgns but slightly reduced or remained unchanged in xx neurons. similarly, the tfam and pgc-1α protein levels and the mitochondrial proteins hsp <dig> and coxiv were increased in xy neurons only. supportively, a balanced stimulation of fusion  and fission  genes and enhanced formation of donut-shaped mitochondria were observed in xy cgns vs. xx neurons .


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that ogd/reox alters mitochondrial biogenesis and morphological changes in a sex-specific way, influencing neuronal injury/survival differently in both sexes.
