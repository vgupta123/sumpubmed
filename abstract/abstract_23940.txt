BACKGROUND
erythropoietin  and its covalently modified analogs are neuroprotective in various models of brain damage and disease. we investigated the effect on brain damage and memory performance, of a continuous 3-day intravenous infusion of epo, starting  <dig> min after a transient  <dig> minute period of global cerebral ischemia in the rat.


RESULTS
we found no effect on selective neuronal damage in the ca <dig> region of the hippocampus, neocortical damage and damage to the striatum assessed at  <dig> days after ischemia. also, no differences were observed in sensori-motor scores between epo treated and saline treated ischemic animals. in contrast, memory performance was significantly improved in the epo treated group. saline treated injured animals  failed in a test assessing recovery of spatial memory , while epo treated animals had few and none failures .


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that although post-ischemic treatment with epo is not neuroprotective in a model of cardiac arrest brain ischemia, its markedly positive effect on brain plasticity and recovery of memory function warrants consideration as treatment of cardiac arrest patients.
