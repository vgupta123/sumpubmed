BACKGROUND
wnt proteins are a family of secreted signaling molecules that regulate key developmental processes in metazoans. the molecular basis of wnt binding to frizzled and lrp5/ <dig> co-receptors has long been unknown due to the lack of structural data on wnt ligands. only recently, the crystal structure of the wnt8-frizzled8-cysteine-rich-domain  complex was solved, but the significance of interaction sites that influence wnt signaling has not been assessed.


RESULTS
here, we present an extensive structure-function analysis of mouse wnt3a in vitro and in vivo. we provide evidence for the essential role of serine  <dig>  glycine  <dig>  and tryptophan  <dig>  in fz binding. importantly, we discovered that valine  <dig> in the site  <dig> binding loop is critical for signaling without contributing to binding. mutations in the presumptive second crd binding site  partly abolished wnt binding. intriguingly, most site  <dig> mutations increased wnt signaling, probably by inhibiting wnt-crd oligomerization. in accordance, increasing amounts of soluble frizzled8-crd protein modulated wnt3a signaling in a biphasic manner.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose a concentration-dependent switch in wnt-crd complex formation from an inactive aggregation state to an activated high mobility state as a possible modulatory mechanism in wnt signaling gradients.
