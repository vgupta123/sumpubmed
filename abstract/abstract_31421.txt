BACKGROUND
analgesia is often indicated in rabbits undergoing surgical procedures or suffering from various painful conditions and the most common adverse effects associated with nsaids occur in the gastrointestinal tract . the objective of this study was to determine the potential effect of long-term  meloxicam administration on the fecal bacterial microbiota in healthy rabbits.

samples of hard feces were collected from six rabbits treated with meloxicam  on days  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig>  next generation sequencing of v <dig> 16s rrna gene products was performed.


RESULTS
a total of 2589912 v <dig> rrna gene sequences passed all quality control filters. firmicutes predominated . sixteen other phyla were also identified but other than verrucomicrobia , all accounted for less than 1% of the identified sequences. within firmicutes, clostridia was the dominant class, accounting for 76% of operational taxon units . in general, there were only few differences observed between time points and different rabbits at the phylum level. a significant change was observed in the relative abundance of proteobacteria over the  <dig> time points .


CONCLUSIONS
the gastrointestinal tract of rabbits harbors dense and diverse microbiota. significant alteration of the hard fecal microbiota does not appear to be a considerable adverse effect expected in rabbits treated for 21 days with oral meloxicam at a dose of 1 mg/kg.
