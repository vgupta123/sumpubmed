BACKGROUND
mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascades are important to cellular signaling in eukaryotes. they regulate growth, development and the response to environmental challenges. mpk cascades function via reversible phosphorylation of cascade components, mekk, mek, and mpk, but also by mpk substrate phosphorylation. using mass spectrometry, we previously identified many in vivo mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> substrates in arabidopsis thaliana, and we disclosed their phosphorylation sites.


RESULTS
we verified phosphorylation of several of our previously identified mpk3/ <dig> substrates using a nonradioactive in vitro labeling assay. we engineered mpk <dig>  mpk <dig>  and mpk <dig> to accept bio-orthogonal atpγs analogs for thiophosphorylating their appropriate substrate proteins. subsequent alkylation of the thiophosphorylated amino acid residue allows immunodetection using thiophosphate ester-specific antibodies. site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids confirmed the protein substrates’ site-specific phosphorylation by mpk <dig> and mpk <dig>  a combined assay with mpk <dig>  mpk <dig>  and mpk <dig> revealed substrate specificity of the individual kinases.


CONCLUSIONS
our work demonstrates that the in vitro-labeling assay represents an effective, specific and highly sensitive test for determining kinase-substrate relationships.
