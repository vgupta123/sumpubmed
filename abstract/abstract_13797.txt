BACKGROUND
in healthy individuals, cytomegalovirus  infection is efficiently controlled by cmv-specific cell-mediated immunity . functional impairment of cmi in immunocompromized individuals however can lead to uncontrolled cmv replication and severe clinical complications. close monitoring of cmv-specific cmi is therefore clinically relevant and might allow a reliable prognosis of cmv disease as well as assist personalized therapeutic decisions.

methods
objective of this work was the optimization and technical validation of an ifn-γ elispot assay for a standardized, sensitive and reliable quantification of cmv-reactive effector cells. t-activated® immunodominant cmv ie- <dig> and pp <dig> proteins were used as stimulants. all basic assay parameters and reagents were tested and optimized to establish a user-friendly protocol and maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of the elispot assay.


RESULTS
optimized and standardized elispot revealed low intra-assay, inter-assay and inter-operator variability  and cv inter-site was lower than 40%. good assay linearity was obtained between  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> pbmc per well upon stimulation with t-activated® ie- <dig>  and pp <dig>  antigens. remarkably, stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells  with t-activated® ie- <dig> and pp <dig> proteins resulted in the activation of a broad range of cmv-reactive effector cells, including cd3+cd4+ , cd3+cd8+ , cd3−cd56+  and cd3+cd56+  cells. accordingly, the optimized ifn-γ elispot assay revealed very high sensitivity  in a cohort of  <dig> healthy donors, of which  <dig> were cmv igg-seropositive.


CONCLUSIONS
the combined use of t-activated® ie- <dig> and pp <dig> proteins for the stimulation of pbmc with the optimized ifn-γ elispot assay represents a highly standardized, valuable tool to monitor the functionality of cmv-specific cmi with great sensitivity and reliability.
