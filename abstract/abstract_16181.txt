BACKGROUND
during development cell migration takes place prior to differentiation of many cell types. the chemokine receptor cxcr <dig> and its ligand sdf <dig> are implicated in migration of several cell lineages, including appendicular muscles.


RESULTS
we dissected the role of sdf1-cxcr <dig> during skeletal myogenesis. we demonstrated that the receptor cxcr4a is expressed in the medial-anterior part of somites, suggesting that chemokine signaling plays a role in this region of the somite. previous reports emphasized co-operation of sdf1a and cxcr4b. we found that during early myogenesis sdf1a co-operates with the second cxcr <dig> of zebrafish â€“ cxcr4a resulting in the commitment of myoblast to form fast muscle. disrupting this chemokine signal caused a reduction in myod and myf <dig> expression and fast fiber formation. in addition, we showed that a dimerization partner of myod and myf <dig>  e <dig>  positively regulates transcription of cxcr4a and sdf1a in contrast to that of sonic hedgehog, which inhibited these genes through induction of expression of id <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we revealed a regulatory feedback mechanism between cxcr4a-sdf1a and genes encoding myogenic regulatory factors, which is involved in differentiation of fast myofibers. this demonstrated a role of chemokine signaling during development of skeletal muscles.
