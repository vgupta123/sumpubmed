BACKGROUND
fas and fasl is important mediators of apoptosis. we have previously reported that the stress levels of corticosterone  increase expression of fas/fasl and activate fas/fasl signal pathway in rat leydig cells, which consequently leads to apoptosis. moreover, our another study showed that nuclear factor of activated t-cells  may play a potential role in up-regulation of fasl during cort-treated rat leydig cell. it is not clear yet how nfat is involved in cort-induced up-regulation of fasl. the aim of the present study is to investigate the molecular mechanisms of nfat-mediated fasl expression in cort-treated leydig cells.


RESULTS
western blot analysis showed that nfat <dig> expression is present in mouse leydig tumor cell . cort-induced increase in fasl expression in mltc- <dig> was ascertained by western blot analysis and cort-induced increase in apoptotic frequency of mltc- <dig> cells was detected by facs with annexin-v labeling. confocal imaging of nfat2-gfp in mltc- <dig> showed that high level of cort stimulated nfat translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. rna interference-mediated knockdown of nfat <dig> significantly attenuated cort-induced up-regulation of fasl expression in mltc. these results corroborated our previous finding that nfat <dig> is involved in cort-induced fasl expression in rat leydig cells and showed that mltc- <dig> is a suitable model for investigating the mechanism of cort-induced fasl expression. the analysis of reporter constructs revealed that the sequence between - <dig> and + <dig> of mouse fasl gene is essential for cort-induced fasl expression. the mutation analysis demonstrated that cort-induced fasl expression is mediated via an nfat binding element located in the - <dig> to + <dig> region. co-transfection studies with an nfat <dig> expression vector and reporter construct containing - <dig> to + <dig> region of fasl gene showed that nfat <dig> confer a strong inducible activity to the fasl promoter at its regulatory region. in addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay further confirmed the results of reporter gene studies by showing the specific binding of nfat <dig> to the - <dig> to + <dig> region.


CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we demonstrated that nfat <dig> directly stimulates transcription of fasl in high level cort-treated mltc- <dig>  in conclusion, the present study provides further evidence for our finding that cort-induced fasl expression in leydig cells is mediated by nfat.
