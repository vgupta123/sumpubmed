BACKGROUND
new strains of vibrio parahaemolyticus that cause diarrhea in humans by seafood ingestion periodically emerge through continuous evolution in the ocean. influx and expansion in the southern chilean ocean of a highly clonal v. parahaemolyticus  population from south east asia caused one of the largest seafood-related diarrhea outbreaks in the world. here, genomics analyses of isolates from this rapidly expanding clonal population offered an opportunity to observe the molecular evolutionary changes often obscured in more diverse populations.


RESULTS
whole genome sequence comparison of eight independent isolates of this population from mussels or clinical cases  was performed. differences of  <dig> to  <dig>  bp genome length and  <dig> to 164 bp single nucleotide variants  were found. most genomic differences corresponded to the presence of regions unique to only one or two isolates, and were probably acquired by horizontal gene transfer . some dna gain was chromosomal but most was in plasmids. one isolate had a large region  missing, which was probably caused by excision of a prophage. genome innovation by the presence of unique dna, attributable to hgt from related bacteria, varied greatly among the isolates, with values of  <dig>   to  <dig>  .


CONCLUSIONS
the evolutionary forces  acting on each isolate of the same population were found to differ to an extent that probably depended on the ecological scenario and life circumstances of each bacterium.
