BACKGROUND
the insect cell line is a critical component in the production of recombinant proteins in the baculovirus expression system and new cell lines hold the promise of increasing both quantity and quality of protein production.


RESULTS
seventy cell lines were established by single-cell cloning from a primary culture of cells derived from eggs of the black witch moth . among  <dig> rapidly growing lines, cell line  <dig>  was selected for further analysis, based on susceptibility to acmnpv infection and production of secreted alkaline phosphatase  from a baculovirus expression vector. in comparisons with low-passage high five  cells, infected ao <dig> cells produced β-galactosidase and seap at levels higher  than those measured from high five cells. analysis of n-glycans of seap produced in ao <dig> cells revealed two n-glycosylation sites and glycosylation patterns similar to those reported for high five and sf <dig> cells. glycopeptide isoforms consisted of pauci- or oligomannose, with and without fucose on n-acetylglucosamine linked to asparagine residues. estimates of ao <dig> cell volume suggest that ao <dig> cells are approximately  <dig> × larger than sf <dig> cells but only approximately 74% of the size of high five cells. ao <dig> cells were highly susceptible to acmnpv infection, similar to infectivity of sf <dig> cells. production of infectious acmnpv budded virions from ao <dig> cells peaked at approximately  <dig>  ×  <dig> iu/ml, exceeding that from high five cells while lower than that from sf <dig> cells. ao <dig> cells grew rapidly in stationary culture with a population doubling time of  <dig>  hr, and ao <dig> cells were readily adapted to serum-free medium  and to a suspension culture system. analysis of ao <dig> and a parental ascalapha odorata cell line indicated that these lines were free of the alphanodavirus that was recently identified as an adventitious agent in high five cell lines.


CONCLUSIONS
ao <dig> cells represent a highly productive new insect cell line that will be useful for heterologous protein expression and other applications in biotechnology.
