BACKGROUND
molybdopterin cofactor  biosynthesis in mycobacterium tuberculosis is associated with a multiplicity of genes encoding several enzymes in the pathway, including the molybdopterin  synthase, a hetero tetramer comprising two moad and two moae subunits. in addition to moad <dig>  moad <dig>  moae <dig>  moae <dig>  the m. tuberculosis genome also contains a moax gene which encodes an mpt-synthase in which the moad and moae domains are located on a single polypeptide. in this study, we assessed the requirement for post-translational cleavage of moax for functionality of this novel, fused mpt synthase and attempted to establish a functional hierarchy for the various mpt-synthase encoding genes in m. tuberculosis.


RESULTS
using a heterologous mycobacterium smegmatis host and the activity of the moco-dependent nitrate reductase, we confirmed that moad <dig> and moae <dig> from m. tuberculosis together encode a functional mpt synthase. in contrast, moad <dig> displayed no functionality in this system, even in the presence of the moebr sulphurtransferase, which contains the rhodansese-like domain, predicted to activate moad subunits. we demonstrated that cleavage of moax into its constituent moad and moae subunits was required for mpt synthase activity and confirmed that cleavage occurs between the gly <dig> and ser <dig> residues in moax. further analysis of the gly81-gly <dig> motif confirmed that both of these residues are necessary for catalysis and that the gly <dig> was required for recognition/cleavage of moax by an as yet unidentified protease. in addition, the moae component of moax was able to function in conjunction with m. smegmatis moad <dig> suggesting that cleavage of moax renders functionally interchangeable subunits. expression of moax in e. coli revealed that incorrect post-translational processing is responsible for the lack of activity of moax in this heterologous host.


CONCLUSIONS
there is a degree of functional interchangeability between the mpt synthase subunits of m. tuberculosis. in the case of moax, post-translational cleavage at the gly <dig> residue is required for function.
