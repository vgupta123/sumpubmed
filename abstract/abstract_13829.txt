BACKGROUND
even though more than  <dig> stroke treatments have been shown effective in preclinical studies, clinically proven treatment alternatives for cerebral infarction remain scarce. amongst the reasons for the discrepancy may be methodological shortcomings, such as high mortality and outcome variability, in the preclinical studies. a common approach in animal stroke experiments is that a) focal cerebral ischemia is inflicted, b) some type of treatment is administered and c) the infarct sizes are assessed. however, within this paradigm, the researcher has to make numerous methodological decisions, including choosing rat strain and type of surgical procedure. even though a few studies have attempted to address the questions experimentally, a lack of consensus regarding the optimal methodology remains.

methods
we therefore meta-analyzed data from  <dig> control groups described in  <dig> articles to find out how rat strain, procedure for causing focal cerebral ischemia and the type of filament coating affected mortality and infarct size variability.


RESULTS
the wistar strain and intraluminal filament procedure using a silicone coated filament was found optimal in lowering infarct size variability. the direct and endothelin methods rendered lower mortality rate, whereas the embolus method increased it compared to the filament method.


CONCLUSIONS
the current article provides means for researchers to adjust their middle cerebral artery occlusion  protocols to minimize infarct size variability and mortality.
