BACKGROUND
the immune system of the purple sea urchin, strongylocentrotus purpuratus, is complex and sophisticated. an important component of sea urchin immunity is the sp185/ <dig> gene family, which is significantly upregulated in immunologically challenged animals. the sp185/ <dig> genes are less than  <dig> kb with two exons and are members of a large diverse family composed of greater than  <dig> genes. the s. purpuratus genome assembly, however, contains only six sp185/ <dig> genes. this underrepresentation could be due to the difficulties that large gene families present in shotgun assembly, where multiple similar genes can be collapsed into a single consensus gene.


RESULTS
to understand the genomic organization of the sp185/ <dig> gene family, a bac insert containing sp185/ <dig> genes was assembled, with careful attention to avoiding artifacts resulting from collapse or artificial duplication/expansion of very similar genes. twelve candidate bac assemblies were generated with varying parameters and the optimal assembly was identified by pcr, restriction digests, and subclone sequencing. the validated assembly contained six sp185/ <dig> genes that were clustered in a  <dig> kb region at one end of the bac with five of the six genes tightly clustered within  <dig> kb. the sp185/ <dig> genes in this cluster were no more similar to each other than to previously sequenced sp185/ <dig> genes isolated from three different animals. this was unexpected given their proximity and putative effects of gene homogenization in closely linked, similar genes. all six genes displayed significant similarity including both 5' and 3' flanking regions, which were bounded by microsatellites. three of the sp185/ <dig> genes and their flanking regions were tandemly duplicated such that each repeated segment consisted of a gene plus  <dig>  kb 5' and  <dig>  kb 3' of the gene . both edges of the segmental duplications were bounded by different microsatellites.


CONCLUSIONS
the high sequence similarity of the sp185/ <dig> genes and flanking regions, suggests that the microsatellites may promote genomic instability and are involved with gene duplication and/or gene conversion and the extraordinary sequence diversity of this family.
