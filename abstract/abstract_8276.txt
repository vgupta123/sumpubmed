BACKGROUND
chickpea  is the second most important grain legume cultivated by resource poor farmers in south asia and sub-saharan africa. in order to harness the untapped genetic potential available for chickpea improvement, we re-sequenced  <dig> chickpea genotypes representing parental lines of  <dig> mapping populations segregating for abiotic , biotic stresses  and nutritionally important  traits using whole genome re-sequencing approach.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  gb data, generated on  <dig> genotypes of chickpea, comprising  <dig>  million reads, with an average sequencing depth of ~ <dig> x for each line. on an average  <dig>  % reads from each genotype were aligned to the chickpea reference genome with  <dig>  % coverage. a total of  <dig> , <dig> unique single nucleotide polymorphisms  and  <dig>  indels were detected while comparing with the reference chickpea genome. highest number of snps were identified on the ca <dig> pseudomolecule. in addition, copy number variations  such as gene deletions and duplications were identified across the chickpea parental genotypes, which were minimum in pi  <dig>  and maximum in jg  <dig> . a total of  <dig>  line specific variations  with the highest percentage were identified in coding regions in icc  <dig>  followed by iccv  <dig> . of  <dig> miscellaneous variations,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were inter-chromosomal variations , intra-chromosomal variations  and inversions  respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
genome-wide snps, indels, cnvs, pavs, and miscellaneous variations identified in different mapping populations are a valuable resource in genetic research and helpful in locating genes/genomic segments responsible for economically important traits. further, the genome-wide variations identified in the present study can be used for developing high density snp arrays for genetics and breeding applications.
