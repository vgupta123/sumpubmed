BACKGROUND
enterotoxigenic escherichia coli  is one of the most important pathogenic bacteria causing severe diarrhoea in human and pigs. in etec strains, the fimbrial types f <dig> and f <dig> are commonly found differently colonized within the small intestine and cause huge economic losses in the swine industry annually worldwide. to address the underlying mechanism, we performed a transcriptome study of porcine intestinal epithelial cells  with and without infection of three representative etec strains.


RESULTS
a total  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes were found in ipec-j <dig> cells infected with f4ab etec , with f4ac etec  and with f18ac etec  compared to the cells without infection , respectively. the number of differentially expressed genes between cf4ab and cf4ac, cf4ab and cf18ac, and cf4ac and cf18ac were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the gene ontology and pathway analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes in cf4abvs control are significantly involved in cell-cycle progress and amino acid metabolism, while the clustered terms of the differentially expressed genes in cf4acvs control comprise immune, inflammation and wounding response and apoptosis as well as cell cycle progress and proteolysis. differentially expressed genes between cf18acvs control are mainly involved in cell-cycle progression and immune response. furthermore, fundamental differences were observed in expression levels of immune-related genes among the three etec treatments, especially for the important pro-inflammatory molecules, including il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnf-Î±, ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig> etc.


CONCLUSIONS
the discovery in this study provides insights into the interaction of porcine intestinal epithelial cells with f <dig> etecs and f <dig> etec, respectively. the genes induced by etecs with f <dig> versus f <dig> fimbriae suggest why etec with f <dig> may be more virulent compared to f <dig> which seems to elicit milder effects.
