BACKGROUND
oligotropha carboxidovorans om <dig> t.  is a chemolithoautotrophic bacterium capable of utilizing co  and fixing co <dig> . we previously published the draft genome of this organism and recently submitted the complete genome sequence to genbank.


RESULTS
the genome sequence of the chemolithoautotrophic bacterium oligotropha carboxidovorans om <dig> consists of a  <dig> -mb chromosome and a 133-kb megaplasmid that contains the genes responsible for utilization of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. to our knowledge, this strain is the first one to be sequenced in the genus oligotropha, the closest fully sequenced relatives being bradyrhizobium sp. btai and usda <dig> and nitrobacter hamburgiensis x <dig>  analysis of the o. carboxidovorans genome reveals potential links between plasmid-encoded chemolithoautotrophy and chromosomally-encoded lipid metabolism. comparative analysis of o. carboxidovorans with closely related species revealed differences in metabolic pathways, particularly in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, as well as transport pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
oligotropha, bradyrhizobium sp and nitrobacter hamburgiensis x <dig> are phylogenetically proximal. although there is significant conservation of genome organization between the species, there are major differences in many metabolic pathways that reflect the adaptive strategies unique to each species.
