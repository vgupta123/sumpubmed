BACKGROUND
previous studies in saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that ala <dig>  and grs <dig>  respectively use acg and ttg as their alternative translation initiator codons. to explore if any other non-atg triplets can act as initiator codons in yeast, ala <dig> was used as a reporter for screening.


RESULTS
we show herein that except for aag and agg, all triplets that differ from atg by a single nucleotide were able to serve as initiator codons in ala <dig>  among these initiator codons, ttg, ctg, acg, and att had ~50% initiating activities relative to that of atg, while gtg, ata, and atc had ~20% initiating activities relative to that of atg. unexpectedly, these non-aug initiator codons exhibited different preferences toward various sequence contexts. in particular, gtg was one of the most efficient non-atg initiator codons, while ata was essentially inactive in the context of grs <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this finding indicates that a sequence context that is favorable for a given non-atg initiator codon might not be as favorable for another.
