BACKGROUND
human growth factor receptor bound protein  <dig>  is an adapter protein that mediates the coupling of tyrosine kinases with their downstream signaling pathways. grb <dig> is frequently overexpressed in invasive and metastatic human cancers and is implicated in cancer progression via its interaction with the erbb <dig> receptor and focal adhesion kinase  that play critical roles in cell proliferation and migration. it is thus a prime target for the development of novel anti-cancer therapies. recently, an inhibitory peptide  has been developed which binds specifically to the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain and is able to attenuate cancer cell proliferation and migration in various cancer cell lines.


RESULTS
as a first step towards understanding how grb <dig> may be inhibited by g7-18nate, we solved the crystal structure of the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain to  <dig>  Å resolution. we describe the details of the peptide binding site underlying target specificity, as well as the dimer interface of grb  <dig> sh <dig>  dimer formation of grb <dig> was determined to be in the μm range using analytical ultracentrifugation for both full-length grb <dig> and the sh <dig> domain alone, suggesting the sh <dig> domain forms the basis of a physiological dimer. itc measurements of the interaction of the g7-18nate peptide with the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain revealed that it binds with a binding affinity of kd = ~ <dig>  μm and nmr spectroscopy titration experiments revealed that peptide binding causes perturbations to both the ligand binding surface of the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain as well as to the dimer interface, suggesting that dimerisation of grb <dig> is impacted on by peptide binding.


CONCLUSIONS
together the data allow us to propose a model of the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain/g7-18nate interaction and to rationalize the basis for the observed binding specificity and affinity. we propose that the current study will assist with the development of second generation grb <dig> sh <dig> domain inhibitors, potentially leading to novel inhibitors of cancer cell migration and invasion.
