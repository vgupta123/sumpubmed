BACKGROUND
beta-thalassemia is a common autosomal recessive hereditary disease in the meditertanean, asia and african areas. over  <dig> mutations have been described in the beta-globin , of which more than  <dig> are associated with a beta-thalassemia phenotype.


RESULTS
we used two highly-specific mutation screening methods, mismatch-specific endonuclease and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, to identify mutations in the hbb gene. the sensitivity and specificity of these two methods were compared. we successfully distinguished mutations in the hbb gene by the mismatch-specific endonuclease method without need for further assay. this technique had 100% sensitivity and specificity for the study sample.


CONCLUSIONS
compared to the dhplc approach, the mismatch-specific endonuclease method allows mutational screening of a large number of samples because of its speed, sensitivity and adaptability to semi-automated systems. these findings demonstrate the feasibility of using the mismatch-specific endonuclease method as a tool for mutation screening.
