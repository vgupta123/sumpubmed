BACKGROUND
despite their versatile functions in multimeric protein complexes, in the modification of enzymatic activities, intercellular communication or regulatory processes, proteins shorter than  <dig> amino acids  are a systematically underestimated class of gene products in bacteria. photosynthetic cyanobacteria provide a paradigm for small protein functions due to extensive work on the photosynthetic apparatus that led to the functional characterization of  <dig> small proteins of less than  <dig> amino acids. in analogy, previously unstudied small orfs with similar degrees of conservation might encode small proteins of high relevance also in other functional contexts.


RESULTS
here we used comparative transcriptomic information available for two model cyanobacteria, synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> and synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> for the prediction of small orfs. we found  <dig> transcriptional units containing candidate small orfs ≤ <dig> codons in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  also including the known mrnas encoding small proteins of the photosynthetic apparatus. from these transcriptional units,  <dig> are shared between the two strains,  <dig> are shared with the higher plant arabidopsis thaliana and  <dig> with e. coli. to verify the existence of the respective μ-proteins in vivo, we selected five genes as examples to which a flag tag sequence was added and re-introduced them into synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  these were the previously annotated gene ssr <dig>  two newly defined genes norf <dig> and norf <dig>  as well as nsir6
  and hlir <dig> , which originally were considered non-coding. upon activation of expression via the cu2+.responsive pete promoter or from the native promoters, all five proteins were detected in western blot experiments.


CONCLUSIONS
the distribution and conservation of these five genes as well as their regulation of expression and the physico-chemical properties of the encoded proteins underline the likely great bandwidth of small protein functions in bacteria and makes them attractive candidates for functional studies.
