BACKGROUND
discovering the location of gene duplications and multiple gene duplication episodes is a fundamental issue in evolutionary molecular biology. the problem introduced by guigó et al. in  <dig> is to map gene duplication events from a collection of rooted, binary gene family trees onto theirs corresponding rooted binary species tree in such a way that the total number of multiple gene duplication episodes is minimized. there are several models in the literature that specify how gene duplications from gene families can be interpreted as one duplication episode. however, in all duplication episode problems gene trees are rooted. this restriction limits the applicability, since unrooted gene family trees are frequently inferred by phylogenetic methods.


RESULTS
in this article we show the first solution to the open problem of episode clustering where the input gene family trees are unrooted. in particular, by using theoretical properties of unrooted reconciliation, we show an efficient algorithm that reduces this problem into the episode clustering problems defined for rooted trees. we show theoretical properties of the reduction algorithm and evaluation of empirical datasets.


CONCLUSIONS
we provided algorithms and tools that were successfully applied to several empirical datasets. in particular, our comparative study shows that we can improve known results on genomic duplication inference from real datasets.
