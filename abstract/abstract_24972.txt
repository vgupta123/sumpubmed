BACKGROUND
berberine is the major alkaloidal component of rhizoma coptidis, and has multiple pharmacological effects including inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, reducing cholesterol and glucose, lowering mortality in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and anti-inflammation etc. thus berberine is a promising drug for diabetes, hyperlipemia, coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke etc. the present study was carried out to investigate the effect of berberine chloride on the spatial memory, inflammation factors interleukin- <dig> beta  and inducible nitric oxide synthase  expression in the rat model of alzheimer's disease  which was established by injecting abeta   into the rats hippocampuses bilaterally.


RESULTS
the rats were given berberine chloride  by intragastric administration once daily for  <dig> days. the spatial memory was assayed by morris water maze test, il-1beta and inos in the hippocampus were assayed by immunohistochemistry and real time polymerase chain reaction . intragastric administration of berberine significantly ameliorated the spatial memory impairment and increased the expression of il-1beta, inos in the rat model of ad.


CONCLUSIONS
berberine might be beneficial to ad by intragastric administration though it might exaggerate the inflammation reaction.
