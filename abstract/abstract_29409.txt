BACKGROUND
recent evidence shows that allograft survival rates show a positive correlation with the number of circulating t regulatory cells . this study investigated both the number and the cytokine profiles exhibited by foxp3+ tregs in blood, spleen and lymph nodes of lewis rat recipients of bn rat cardiac allografts after a single-dose of rapamycin .


RESULTS
rats were divided into three groups: control group , and recipients treated with a single dose of rapa on either day  <dig> or day  <dig>  post-transplant. we analyzed the number of foxp3+tregs and the expression of foxp <dig> and cytokines in the peripheral blood and the peripheral lymphoid tissues. no difference was found in the numbers of circulating foxp3+ tregs between these three groups. rapa administration significantly increased foxp <dig> expression in peripheral lymphoid tissues after a single dose of rapa on day  <dig> post-transplant. foxp3+tregs inhibited the activity of effector t cells  via the secretion of tgf-Î² <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the number of tregs in the recipient's blood may not be a good predictor of transplant rejection. foxp3+tregs inhibit the activity of teff cells mainly in the peripheral lymphoid tissues.
