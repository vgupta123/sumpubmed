BACKGROUND
pseudomonas fluorescens is a genetically and physiologically diverse species of bacteria present in many habitats and in association with plants. this species of bacteria produces a large array of secondary metabolites with potential as natural products. p. fluorescens isolate wh <dig> produces germination-arrest factor , a predicted small peptide or amino acid analog with herbicidal activity that specifically inhibits germination of seeds of graminaceous species.


RESULTS
we used a hybrid next-generation sequencing approach to develop a high-quality draft genome sequence for p. fluorescens wh <dig>  we employed automated, manual, and experimental methods to further improve the draft genome sequence. from this assembly of  <dig>  megabases, we predicted  <dig> genes, of which  <dig> were core to p. fluorescens and  <dig> were unique to wh <dig>  comparative genomic studies of wh <dig> revealed high similarity in synteny and orthology of genes with p. fluorescens sbw <dig>  a phylogenomic study also placed wh <dig> in the same lineage as sbw <dig>  in a previous non-saturating mutagenesis screen we identified two genes necessary for gaf activity in wh <dig>  mapping of their flanking sequences revealed genes that encode a candidate anti-sigma factor and an aminotransferase. finally, we discovered several candidate virulence and host-association mechanisms, one of which appears to be a complete type iii secretion system.


CONCLUSIONS
the improved high-quality draft genome sequence of wh <dig> contributes towards resolving the p. fluorescens species, providing additional impetus for establishing two separate lineages in p. fluorescens. despite the high levels of orthology and synteny to sbw <dig>  wh <dig> still had a substantial number of unique genes and represents another source for the discovery of genes with implications in affecting plant growth and health. two genes are demonstrably necessary for gaf and further characterization of their proteins is important for developing natural products as control measure against grassy weeds. finally, wh <dig> is the first isolate of p. fluorescens reported to encode a complete t3ss. this gives us the opportunity to explore the role of what has traditionally been thought of as a virulence mechanism for non-pathogenic interactions with plants.
