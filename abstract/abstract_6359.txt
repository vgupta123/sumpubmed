BACKGROUND
microarrays have emerged as the preferred platform for high throughput gene expression analysis. cross-hybridization among genes with high sequence similarities can be a source of error reducing the reliability of dna microarray results.


RESULTS
we have developed a tool called xhm  for assessment of the reliability of hybridization signals by detecting potential cross-hybridizations on dna microarrays. this is done by comparing the sequences of the probes against an extensive database representing the transcriptome of the organism in question. xhm is available online at .


CONCLUSIONS
using xhm with its user-adjustable parameters will enable scientists to check their lists of differentially expressed genes from microarray experiments for potential cross-hybridizations. this provides information that may be useful in the validation of the microarray results.
