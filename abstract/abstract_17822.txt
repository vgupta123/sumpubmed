BACKGROUND
cdc23/mcm <dig> is required for the initiation and elongation steps of dna replication but its biochemical function is unclear. here, we probe its function using a novel approach in fission yeast, involving cdc <dig> cleavage by the tev protease.


RESULTS
insertion of a tev protease cleavage site into cdc <dig> allows in vivo removal of the c-terminal  <dig> aa of the protein by tev protease induction, resulting in an s phase arrest. this c-terminal fragment of cdc <dig> is not retained in the nucleus after cleavage, showing that it lacks a nuclear localization signal and ability to bind to chromatin. using an in situ chromatin binding procedure we have determined how the s phase chromatin association of dna polymerase α-primase and the gins  complex is affected by cdc <dig> inactivation. the chromatin binding and sub-nuclear distribution of dna primase catalytic subunit  is affected by cdc <dig> cleavage and also by inactivation of cdc <dig> using a degron allele, implying that dna polymerase α-primase function is dependent on cdc <dig>  in contrast to the effect on spp <dig>  the chromatin association of the psf <dig> subunit of the gins complex is not affected by cdc <dig> inactivation.


CONCLUSIONS
an important function of cdc <dig> in the elongation step of dna replication may be to assist in the docking of dna polymerase α-primase to chromatin.
