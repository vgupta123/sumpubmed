BACKGROUND
stat <dig> is an essential transcription factor for interferon-γ-mediated gene responses. a distinct sumoylation consensus site  702ikte <dig> is localized in the c-terminal region of stat <dig>  where lys <dig> is a target for pias-induced sumo modification. several studies indicate that sumoylation has an inhibitory role on stat1-mediated gene expression but the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood.


RESULTS
here, we have performed a structural and functional analysis of sumoylation in stat <dig>  we show that deconjugation of sumo by senp <dig> enhances the transcriptional activity of stat <dig>  confirming a negative regulatory effect of sumoylation on stat <dig> activity. inspection of molecular model indicated that consensus site is well exposed to sumo-conjugation in stat <dig> homodimer and that the conjugated sumo moiety is directed towards dna, thus able to form a sterical hindrance affecting promoter binding of dimeric stat <dig>  in addition, oligoprecipitation experiments indicated that sumoylation deficient stat <dig> e705q mutant has higher dna-binding activity on stat <dig> responsive gene promoters than wild-type stat <dig>  furthermore, sumoylation deficient stat <dig> e705q mutant displayed enhanced histone h <dig> acetylation on interferon-γ-responsive promoter compared to wild-type stat <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that sumoylation participates in regulation of stat <dig> responses by modulating dna-binding properties of stat <dig>
