BACKGROUND
analysis of factors contributing to high affinity antibody-protein interactions provides insight into natural antibody evolution, and guides the design of antibodies with new or enhanced function. we previously studied the interaction between antibody d <dig> and its target, a designed protein based on hiv- <dig> gp <dig> known as 5-helix, as a model system . antibody d <dig> represents an interesting case study because it is derived from the vh1- <dig> germline segment; this germline segment is characterized by a hydrophobic second heavy chain complementarity determining region  that constitutes the major functional paratope in d <dig> and several antibodies derived from the same progenitor.


RESULTS
here we explore side chain requirements for affinity and specificity in d <dig> using phage display. two d5-based libraries were prepared that contained diversity in all three light chain complementarity determining regions , and in the third hcdr . the first library allowed residues to vary among a restricted set of six amino acids . the second library was designed based on a survey of existing vh1- <dig> antibody structures . both libraries were subjected to multiple rounds of selection against 5-helix, and individual clones characterized. we found that selectants from d5-lib-i generally had moderate affinity and specificity, while many clones from d5-lib-ii exhibited d5-like properties. additional analysis of the d5-lib-ii functional population revealed position-specific biases for particular amino acids, many that differed from the identity of those side chains in d <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
together these results suggest that there is some permissiveness for alternative side chains in the lcdrs and hcdr <dig> of d <dig>  but that replacement with a minimal set of residues is not tolerated in this scaffold for 5-helix recognition. this work provides novel information about this high-affinity interaction involving an antibody from the vh1- <dig> germline segment.
