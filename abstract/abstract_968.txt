BACKGROUND
hibernation is an adaptive strategy to survive in highly seasonal or unpredictable environments. the molecular and genetic basis of hibernation physiology in mammals has only recently been studied using large scale genomic approaches. we analyzed gene expression in the american black bear, ursus americanus, using a custom  <dig>  cdna probe microarray to detect differences in expression that occur in heart and liver during winter hibernation in comparison to summer active animals.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> genes in heart and  <dig> genes in liver that were differentially expressed between winter and summer. the expression of  <dig> genes was significantly elevated during hibernation in both heart and liver. these genes are mostly involved in lipid catabolism and protein biosynthesis and include rna binding protein motif  <dig> , which enhances protein synthesis at mildly hypothermic temperatures. elevated expression of protein biosynthesis genes suggests induction of translation that may be related to adaptive mechanisms reducing cardiac and muscle atrophies over extended periods of low metabolism and immobility during hibernation in bears. coordinated reduction of transcription of genes involved in amino acid catabolism suggests redirection of amino acids from catabolic pathways to protein biosynthesis. we identify common for black bears and small mammalian hibernators transcriptional changes in the liver that include induction of genes responsible for fatty acid Î² oxidation and carbohydrate synthesis and depression of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, carbohydrate catabolism, cellular respiration and detoxification pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings show that modulation of gene expression during winter hibernation represents molecular mechanism of adaptation to extreme environments.
