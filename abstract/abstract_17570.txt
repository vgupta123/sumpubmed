BACKGROUND
in yeast, genome-wide periodic patterns associated with energy-metabolic oscillations have been shown recently for both short  and long  periods.


RESULTS
the dynamical regulation due to mrna stability is found to be an important aspect of the genome-wide coordination of the long-period yeast metabolic cycle. it is shown that for periodic genes, arranged in classes according either to expression profile or to function, the pulses of mrna abundance have phase and width which are directly proportional to the corresponding turnover rates.


CONCLUSIONS
the cascade of events occurring during the yeast metabolic cycle  reflects to a large extent the gene expression program observable in other dynamical contexts such as the response to stresses/stimuli.
