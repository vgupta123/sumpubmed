BACKGROUND
variations in recombination fraction  among chromosomal regions, individuals and families have been observed and have an important impact on quantitative trait loci  mapping studies. such variations on porcine chromosome x  and on other mammalian chromosome x are rarely explored. the emerging assembly of pig sequence provides exact physical location of many markers, facilitating the study of a fine-scale recombination landscape of the pig genome by comparing a clone-based physical map to a genetic map. using large offspring of f <dig> females from two large-scale resource populations , we were able to evaluate the heterogeneity in θ for a specific interval among individual f <dig> females.


RESULTS
alignments between the cytogenetic map, radiation hybrid  map, genetic maps and clone map of ssc-x with the physical map of human chromosome x  are presented. the most likely order of  <dig> markers on ssc-x is inferred. the average recombination rate across ssc-x is of ~ <dig>  cm/mb. however, almost no recombination occurred in a large region of ~ <dig> mb extending from the centromere to xq <dig>  whereas in the surrounding regions and in the xq telomeric region a recombination rate of  <dig> - <dig>  cm/mb was observed, more than twice the chromosome-wide average rate. significant differences in θ among f <dig> females within each population were observed for several chromosomal intervals. the largest variation was observed in both populations in the interval umnp71-sw <dig>  or more precisely in the subinterval umnp891-umnp <dig>  the individual variation in θ over this subinterval was found associated with f <dig> females' maternal haplotypes  and independent of paternal haplotype . the θ between umnp <dig> and umnp <dig> for haplotype  <dig> and  <dig> differed by more than fourteen-fold .


CONCLUSIONS
this study reveals marked regional, individual and haplotype-specific differences in recombination rate on ssc-x. lack of recombination in such a large region makes it impossible to narrow qtl interval using traditional fine-mapping approaches. the relationship between recombination variation and haplotype polymorphism is shown for the first time in pigs.
