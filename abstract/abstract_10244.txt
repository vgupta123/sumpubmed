BACKGROUND
tools for high throughput sequencing and de novo assembly make the analysis of transcriptomes  feasible for almost any organism. yet a challenge for biologists is that it can be difficult to assign identities to gene sequences, especially from non-model organisms. phylogenetic analyses are one useful method for assigning identities to these sequences, but such methods tend to be time-consuming because of the need to re-calculate trees for every gene of interest and each time a new data set is analyzed. in response, we employed existing tools for phylogenetic analysis to produce a computationally efficient, tree-based approach for annotating transcriptomes or new genomes that we term phylogenetically-informed annotation , which places uncharacterized genes into pre-calculated phylogenies of gene families.


RESULTS
we generated maximum likelihood trees for  <dig> genes from a light interaction toolkit , a collection of genes that underlie the function or development of light-interacting structures in metazoans. to do so, we searched protein sequences predicted from  <dig> fully-sequenced genomes and built trees using tools for phylogenetic analysis in the osiris package of galaxy . next, to rapidly annotate transcriptomes from organisms that lack sequenced genomes, we repurposed a maximum likelihood-based evolutionary placement algorithm  to place sequences of potential lit genes on to our pre-calculated gene trees. finally, we implemented pia in galaxy and used it to search for lit genes in  <dig> newly-sequenced transcriptomes from the light-interacting tissues of a range of cephalopod mollusks, arthropods, and cubozoan cnidarians. our new trees for lit genes are available on the bitbucket public repository  and we demonstrate pia on a publicly-accessible web server .


CONCLUSIONS
our new trees for lit genes will be a valuable resource for researchers studying the evolution of eyes or other light-interacting structures. we also introduce pia, a high throughput method for using phylogenetic relationships to identify lit genes in transcriptomes from non-model organisms. with simple modifications, our methods may be used to search for different sets of genes or to annotate data sets from taxa outside of metazoa.
