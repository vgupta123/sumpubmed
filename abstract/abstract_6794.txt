BACKGROUND
the involvement of histone acetylation in facilitating gene expression is well-established, particularly in the case of histones h <dig> and h <dig>  it was previously shown in saccharomyces cerevisiae that gene expression was significantly down-regulated and chromatin more condensed in stationary phase compared to exponential phase. we were therefore interested in establishing the acetylation state of histone h <dig> and h <dig> in stationary and in exponential phase, since the regulation of this modification could contribute to transcriptional shut-down and chromatin compaction during semi-quiescence.


RESULTS
we made use of nano-spray tandem mass spectrometry to perform a precursor ion scan to detect an m/z  <dig> immonium ion, diagnostic of an nÎµ-acetylated lysine residue that allowed unambiguous identification of acetylated as opposed to tri-methylated lysine. the fragmentation spectra of peptides thus identified were searched with mascot against the swiss-prot database, and the y-ion and b-ion fragmentation series subsequently analyzed for mass shifts compatible with acetylated lysine residues. we found that k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> of histone h <dig> and k <dig> and k <dig> of histone h <dig> were acetylated in exponential phase , but could not detect these modifications in histones isolated from stationary phase cells at the sensitivity level of the mass spectrometer. the corresponding un-acetylated peptides were, however, observed. a significantly higher level of acetylation of these residues in exponential phase was confirmed by immuno-blotting.


CONCLUSIONS
h4k <dig> acetylation was previously shown to disrupt formation of condensed chromatin in vitro. we propose that de-acetylation of h4k <dig> allowed formation of condensed chromatin in stationary phase, and that acetylation of h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h4k <dig> reflected the active transcriptional state of the yeast genome in exponential phase.
