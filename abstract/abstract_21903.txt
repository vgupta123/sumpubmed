BACKGROUND
nitrate-induced reprogramming of the transcriptome has recently been shown to be highly context dependent. herein, a systems biology approach was developed to identify the components and role of cross-talk between nitrate and hormone signals, likely to be involved in the conditional response of no3- signaling.


RESULTS
biclustering was used to identify a set of genes that are n-responsive across a range of nitrogen -treatment backgrounds  using a meta-dataset of  <dig> affymetrix ath <dig> chips from  <dig> different laboratories. twenty-one biclusters were found to be n-responsive across subsets of this meta-dataset. n-bicluster  <dig>  was selected for further analysis, as it was shown to be reproducibly responsive to no3- as a signal, across a wide-variety of background conditions and datasets. n-bicluster  <dig> genes were then used as "seed" to identify putative cross-talk mechanisms between nitrate and hormone signaling. for this, the  <dig> nitrate-regulated genes in n-bicluster  <dig> were biclustered over a meta-dataset of  <dig> ath <dig> chips spanning a variety of hormone treatments. this analysis divided the bicluster  <dig> genes into two classes: i) genes controlled by no3- only vs. ii) genes controlled by both no3- and hormones. the genes in the latter group showed a no3- response that is significantly enhanced, compared to the former. in silico analysis identified two cis-regulatory elements candidates   potentially involved the interplay between no3- and hormonal signals.


CONCLUSIONS
this systems analysis enabled us to derive a hypothesis in which hormone signals are proposed to enhance the nitrate response, providing a potential mechanistic explanation for the link between nitrate signaling and the control of plant development.
