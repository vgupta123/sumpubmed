BACKGROUND
disruption of epithelial cell-cell adhesions represents an early and important stage in tumor metastasis. this process can be modeled in vitro by exposing cells to chemical tumor promoters, phorbol esters and octylindolactam-v , known to activate protein kinase c . however, molecular events mediating pkc-dependent disruption of epithelial cell-cell contact remain poorly understood. in the present study we investigate mechanisms by which pkc activation induces disassembly of tight junctions  and adherens junctions  in a model pancreatic epithelium.


RESULTS
exposure of hpaf-ii human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell monolayers to either oi-v or 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate caused rapid disruption and internalization of ajs and tjs. activity of classical pkc isoenzymes was responsible for the loss of cell-cell contacts which was accompanied by cell rounding, phosphorylation and relocalization of the f-actin motor nonmuscle myosin  ii. the oi-v-induced disruption of ajs and tjs was prevented by either pharmacological inhibition of nm ii with blebbistatin or by sirna-mediated downregulation of nm iia. furthermore, aj/tj disassembly was attenuated by inhibition of rho-associated kinase  ii, but was insensitive to blockage of mlck, calmodulin, erk1/ <dig>  caspases and rhoa gtpase.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that stimulation of pkc disrupts epithelial apical junctions via rock-ii dependent activation of nm ii, which increases contractility of perijunctional actin filaments. this mechanism is likely to be important for cancer cell dissociation and tumor metastasis.
