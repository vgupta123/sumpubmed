BACKGROUND
the emerged human infection with avian influenza a  virus in china since  <dig> has aroused global concerns. there is great demand for simple and rapid diagnostic method for early detection of h7n <dig> to provide timely treatment and disease control. the aim of the current study was to develop a rapid, accurate and feasible reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification  assay for detection of h7n <dig> virus.


RESULTS
the detection limits of the h7- and n9-specific rt-lamp assay were both approximately  <dig>  pfu per reaction. no cross-reactivity was observed with other subtype of influenza viruses or common respiratory viral pathogens. the assay worked well with clinical specimens from patients and chickens, and exhibited high specificity and sensitivity.


CONCLUSIONS
the h7/n <dig> specific rt-lamp assay was sensitive and accurate, which could be a useful alternative in clinical diagnostics of influenza a  virus, especially in the hospitals and laboratories without sophisticated diagnostic systems.
