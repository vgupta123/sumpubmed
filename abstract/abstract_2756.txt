BACKGROUND
real-time pcr techniques are being widely used for nucleic acids analysis, but one limitation of current frequently employed real-time pcr is the high cost of the labeled probe for each target molecule.


RESULTS
we describe a real-time pcr technique employing attached universal duplex probes , which has the advantage of generating fluorescence by probe hydrolysis and strand displacement over current real-time pcr methods. audp involves one set of universal duplex probes in which the 5' end of the fluorescent probe  and a complementary quenching probe  lie in close proximity so that fluorescence can be quenched. the pcr primer pair with attached universal template  and the fp are identical to the ut sequence. we have shown that the audp technique can be used for detecting multiple target dna sequences in both simplex and duplex real-time pcr assays for gene expression analysis, genotype identification, and genetically modified organism  quantification with comparable sensitivity, reproducibility, and repeatability with other real-time pcr methods.


CONCLUSIONS
the results from gmo quantification, gene expression analysis, genotype identification, and gmo quantification using audp real-time pcr assays indicate that the audp real-time pcr technique has been successfully applied in nucleic acids analysis, and the developed audp real-time pcr technique will offer an alternative way for nucleic acid analysis with high efficiency, reliability, and flexibility at low cost.
