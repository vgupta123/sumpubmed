BACKGROUND
high salinity adversely affects crop production. pyruvic acid is the precursor of abscisic acid  and other chemicals that are synthesized in chloroplast, some of which are involved in the response to salt. the transportation of pyruvic acid into chloroplast is mediated by pyruvate transporters. however, whether pyruvate transporters are involved in salt response has not been studied so far. here, we answered this issue by assessing the function of a wheat pyruvate transporter in salt response.


RESULTS
a pyruvate transporter tabass <dig> was isolated from salt-tolerant wheat cultivar shanrong  <dig>  the expression of tabass <dig> was induced by nacl stress as well as h2o <dig> and aba treatments. constitutive expression of tabass <dig> in arabidopsis bass2- <dig> mutant complemented the mevastatin-sensitive phenotype that reflects the deficiency of transporting pyruvic acid into chloroplast. overexpression of tabass <dig> enhanced salinity tolerance and reactive oxygen species scavenging in wheat. arabidopsis constitutively expressing tabass <dig> also exhibited enhanced tolerance to salinity and oxidative stress. in arabidopsis, tabass <dig> repressed the expression of aba insensitive  <dig> , a node linking aba signaling and plastid retrograde signaling pathways. however, the enhanced salinity tolerance of tabass <dig> overexpression arabidopsis was abolished when abi <dig> expression was restored to the level of wild-type through overexpressing abi <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our work demonstrates that tabass <dig> enhances salinity tolerance of plants via modulating abi <dig> expression. this indicates that pyruvate transporters indeed participate in the interaction of plants with environmental stimuli.
