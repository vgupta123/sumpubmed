BACKGROUND
molecular genotyping of bacteria has revolutionized the study of tuberculosis epidemiology, yet these established laboratory techniques typically require subjective and laborious interpretation by trained professionals. in the context of a tuberculosis case contact study in the gambia we used a reverse hybridization laboratory assay called spoligotype analysis. to facilitate processing of spoligotype images we have developed tools and algorithms to automate the classification and transcription of these data directly to a database while allowing for manual editing.


RESULTS
features extracted from each of the  <dig> spots on a spoligo film were classified using two supervised learning algorithms. a graphical user interface allows manual editing of the classification, before export to a database. the application was tested on ten films of differing quality and the results of the best classifier were compared to expert manual classification, giving a median correct classification rate of  <dig> % , with an automated processing time of less than  <dig> minute per film.


CONCLUSIONS
the software implementation offers considerable time savings over manual processing whilst allowing expert editing of the automated classification. the automatic upload of the classification to a database reduces the chances of transcription errors.
