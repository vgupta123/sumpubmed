BACKGROUND
suppression of body weight and symptom of anorexia are major symptoms of depression. recently, we reported that chronic social defeat stress  induced suppression of body weight gain and anorexic feeding behavior in rats. these abnormalities were the result of disrupted malonyl-coenzyme a  signaling pathway in the hypothalamus. however, the condition of peripheral leptin and its hypothalamic downstream signal molecules which regulate hypothalamic malonyl-coa level in the csds-exposed rats  is still unknown.


RESULTS
csds rats showed suppressed body weight gain and food intake. the weight of the csds ratsâ€™ epididymal white adipose tissues was decreased when compared to the control rats. the plasma cholesterol concentration was decreased significantly in the csds rats compared to the control rats . the plasma glucose concentration was slightly decreased in the csds rats compared to the control rats . the expression of leptin mrna in epididymal white adipose tissues and the plasma leptin concentration were decreased in csds rats. furthermore, the phosphorylation of the hypothalamic downstream signals of leptin, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/ <dig>  and signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> , was decreased in csds rats.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicated that decreased peripheral leptin expression in csds rats could down-regulate the hypothalamic downstream signaling pathways of leptin while suppressed food intake. these data indicate that csds induces the down-regulation of hypothalamic ampk following the elevation of hypothalamic malonyl-coa levels and is independent of peripheral leptin and glucose.
