BACKGROUND
a method for inhibiting the expression of particular genes using external guide sequences  has been developed in bacteria, mammalian cells and maize cells.


RESULTS
to examine whether egs technology can be used to down-regulate gene expression in caenorhabditis elegans , we generated egs-ngfp-lacz and egs-mtgfp that are targeted against ngfp-lacz and mtgfp mrna, respectively. these egss were introduced, both separately and together, into the c. elegans strain pd <dig>  which contains ngfp-lacz and mtgfp. consequently, the expression levels of ngfp-lacz and mtgfp were affected by egs-ngfp-lacz and egs-mtgfp, respectively. we further generated an egs library that contains a randomized antisense domain of trna-derived egs . examination of the composition of the egs library showed that there was no obvious bias in the cloning of certain egss. a subset of egss was randomly chosen for screening in the c. elegans strain n <dig>  about 6% of these egss induced abnormal phenotypes such as p <dig> slow postembryonic growth, p <dig> larval arrest, p <dig> larval lethality and p <dig> sterility. of these, egs- <dig> and egs- <dig> caused the greatest phenotype changes, and their target mrnas were identified as zk <dig>  mrna and lin- <dig> mrna, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
egs technology can be used to down-regulate gene expression in c. elegans. the egs library is a research tool for reverse genetic screening in c. elegans. these observations are potentially of great importance to further our understanding and use of c. elegans genomics.
