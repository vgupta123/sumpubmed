BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression. the aim of this study was to identify mirnas differentially expressed between mild and moderately emphysematous lung, as well as their functional target mrnas. resected lung from patients with copd undergoing lung cancer surgery was profiled using mirna  and mrna  microarrays. cells of lung origin  were profiled using mrna microarrays  after in vitro manipulation.


RESULTS
copd patients had mean  age  <dig>  years, fev <dig>  <dig> % predicted and gas transfer   <dig> % predicted. five mirnas  were significantly down-regulated in lung from patients with moderate compared to mild emphysema as defined by gas transfer . in vitro upregulation of mir-34c in respiratory cells led to down-regulation of predicted target mrnas, including serpine <dig>  map4k <dig>  znf <dig>  aldoa and hnf4a. the fold change in ex-vivo expression of all five predicted target genes inversely correlated with that of mir-34c in emphysematous lung, but this relationship was strongest for serpine <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
differences in mirna expression are associated with emphysema severity in copd patients. mir-34c modulates expression of its putative target gene, serpine <dig>  in vitro in respiratory cell lines and ex vivo in emphysematous lung tissue.
