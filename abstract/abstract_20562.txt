BACKGROUND
the quaking homolog, kh domain rna binding   is a candidate gene for schizophrenia. disturbed qki mrna expression is observed in the prefrontal cortex of patients, and some of these changes correlate to treatment with antipsychotic drugs.

to test if low doses of antipsychotic drugs can modify qki mrna expression, human astrocytoma  and oligodendroglioma  cell lines were treated with five different antipsychotic drugs including haloperidol, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone. messenger rna expression levels of splice variants qki- <dig>  qki- <dig> and qki- <dig> were measured by real-time pcr.


RESULTS
haloperidol treatment  doubled qki- <dig> mrna levels in u <dig> cells after  <dig> hours . the effect was dose dependent, and cells treated with ten times higher concentration  responded with a five-fold and three-fold increase in qki- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after treatment, respectively .


CONCLUSIONS
the results in u <dig> cells suggest that qki- <dig> mrna expression in human astrocytes is induced by haloperidol, at concentrations similar to plasma levels relevant to clinical treatment of schizophrenia. the molecular mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs after binding to receptors is not well known. we hypothesize that qki regulation is involved in this mechanism.
