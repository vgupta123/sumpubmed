BACKGROUND
protein structures can be reliably predicted by template-based modeling  when experimental structures of homologous proteins are available. however, it is challenging to obtain structures more accurate than the single best templates by either combining information from multiple templates or by modeling regions that vary among templates or are not covered by any templates.


RESULTS
we introduce galaxytbm, a new tbm method in which the more reliable core region is modeled first from multiple templates and less reliable, variable local regions, such as loops or termini, are then detected and re-modeled by an ab initio method. this tbm method is based on “seok-server,” which was tested in casp <dig> and assessed to be amongst the top tbm servers. the accuracy of the initial core modeling is enhanced by focusing on more conserved regions in the multiple-template selection and multiple sequence alignment stages. additional improvement is achieved by ab initio modeling of up to  <dig> unreliable local regions in the fixed framework of the core structure. overall, galaxytbm reproduced the performance of seok-server, with galaxytbm and seok-server resulting in average gdt-ts of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, when tested on  <dig> single-domain casp <dig> tbm targets. for application to multi-domain proteins, galaxytbm must be combined with domain-splitting methods.


CONCLUSIONS
application of galaxytbm to casp <dig> targets demonstrates that accurate protein structure prediction is possible by use of a multiple-template-based approach, and ab initio modeling of variable regions can further enhance the model quality.
