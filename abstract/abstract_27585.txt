BACKGROUND
the aqueous extract of a brazilian palm-tree fruit - the babassu -  exerts a clear immunostimulative activity in vivo. in the present work, the possibility that bae can promote th <dig> immune responses in mice of a th <dig> immune response-prone strain - the balb/c was investigated. bae itself, and preparations consisting of leishmania amazonensis promastigote extract , adsorbed or not to al <dig>  and in the presence or not of bae, were used as immunogens. le and al <dig> have been shown to preferentially elicit th <dig> immune responses.


RESULTS
the addition of bae to le-containing immunogenic preparations, adsorbed or not to al <dig>  clearly promoted the in vitro production of interferon γ , a major th1-dependent cytokine, and not of interleukin  <dig> , by le-stimulated splenocytes of immunized balb/c mice. it also promoted the in vivo formation of igg2a anti-le antibodies. however, immunization with le by itself led to an increased production of il- <dig> by le-stimulated splenocytes, and this production, albeit not enhanced, was not reduced by the addition of bae to the immunogen. on the other hand, the il- <dig> production by le-stimulated splenocytes was significantly lower in mice immunized with a preparation containing al3-adsorbed le and bae than in mice immunized with the control preparation of al3-adsorbed le without bae. moreover, an increased production of ifn-γ, and not of il- <dig>  was observed in the culture supernatants of splenocytes, from bae-immunized mice, which were in vitro stimulated with bae or which received no specific in vitro stimulus. no differences in il- <dig>  levels in the supernatants of splenocytes from mice that were injected with bae, in relation to splenocytes from control mice, were observed. the spontaneous ex vivo production of no by splenocytes of mice that had been injected with bae was significantly higher than the production of no by splenocytes of control mice.


CONCLUSIONS
based on the results described above, bae, or biologically active molecules purified from it, should be further investigated as a possible adjuvant, in association or not with aluminium compounds, for the preferential induction of th1-dependent immune responses against different antigens in distinct murine strains and animal species.
