BACKGROUND
inflammatory bowel diseases  are intestinal disorders characterized by inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. interleukin- <dig> is one of the most important anti-inflammatory cytokines involved in the intestinal immune system and because of its role in downregulating inflammatory cascades, its potential for ibd therapy is under study. we previously presented the development of an invasive strain of lactococcus lactis  producing fibronectin binding protein a  which was capable of delivering, directly to host cells, a eukaryotic dna expression vector coding for il- <dig> of mus musculus  and diminish inflammation in a trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid -induced mouse model of intestinal inflammation. as a new therapeutic strategy against ibd, the aim of this work was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of two l. lactis strains  carrying the therapeutic pvalac:il- <dig> plasmid in the prevention of inflammation in a dextran sodium sulphate -induced mouse model.


RESULTS
results obtained showed that not only delivery of the pvalac:il- <dig> plasmid by the invasive strain l. lactis mg <dig> fnbpa+, but also by the wild-type strain l. lactis mg <dig>  was effective at diminishing intestinal inflammation  in the dss-induced ibd mouse model.


CONCLUSIONS
administration of both l. lactis strains carrying the pvalac:il- <dig> plasmid was effective at diminishing inflammation in this murine model of experimental colitis, showing their potential for therapeutic intervention of ibd.
