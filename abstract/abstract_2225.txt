BACKGROUND
the aim of this study was to compare the ability of four commercially available media for screening extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  to detect and identify esbl-producing salmonella and shigella in fecal samples.

a total of  <dig> salmonella- and  <dig> shigella-isolates producing esbla and/or ampc, were received at norwegian institute of public health between  <dig> and  <dig>  the  <dig> isolates were mixed with fecal specimens and tested on four esbl screening media; chromid esbl , brilliance esbl , blse agar  and chromagar esbl . the blse agar is a biplate consisting of two different agars. brilliance and chromagar are supposed to suppress growth of ampc-producing bacteria while chromid and blse agar are intended to detect both esbla and ampc.


RESULTS
the total sensitivity  with 95% confidence intervals after 24 hours of incubation were as follows: chromid: 95% , brilliance: 93% , blse agar : 99% , blse agar : 99%  and chromagar: 85% . the blse agar identified salmonella and shigella isolates as lactose-negative. the other agars based on chromogenic technology displayed salmonella and shigella flexneri isolates with colorless colonies . shigella sonnei produced pink colonies, similar to the morphology described for e. coli.


CONCLUSIONS
all four agar media were reliable in screening fecal samples for esbla-producing salmonella and shigella. however, only chromid and blse agar gave reliable detection of ampc-producing isolates. identification of different bacterial species based on colony colour alone was not accurate for any of the four agars.
