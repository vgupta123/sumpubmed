BACKGROUND
acyl-homoserine lactone  and alkyl quinolone  based quorum-sensing  systems are important for pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence and biofilm formation. the effect of qs on biofilm formation is influenced by various genetic and environmental factors. here, we used a colony biofilm assay to study the effect of the central acyl-hsl qs regulator, lasr, on biofilm formation and structure in the representative clinical p. aeruginosa isolate zk <dig> 


RESULTS
a lasr mutant exhibited wrinkled colony morphology at 37Â°c in contrast to the smooth colony morphology of the wild-type. mutational analysis indicated that wrinkling of the lasr mutant is dependent on pel, encoding a biofilm matrix exopolysaccharide. suppressor mutagenesis and complementation analysis implicated the aq signaling pathway as the link between las qs and colony morphology. in this pathway, genes pqsa-d are involved in the synthesis of 4-hydroxyalkyl quinolines , which are converted to  <dig> -dihydroxyalkyl quinolines  by the product of the lasr-dependent pqsh gene. measurement of aq in the wild-type, the lasr pqsa::tn suppressor mutant as well as the defined lasr, pqsh, and lasr pqsh mutants showed a correlation between 4-hydroxyalkyl quinoline levels and the degree of colony wrinkling. most importantly, the lasr pqsh double mutant displayed wrinkly morphology without producing any  <dig> -dihydroxyalkyl quinolines. constitutive expression of pqsa-d genes in a lasr pqsr::tnmutant showed that colony wrinkling does not require the aq receptor pqsr.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these results indicate that the las qs system represses pel and modulates colony morphology through a 4-hydroxyalkyl quinoline in a pqsr-independent manner, ascribing a novel function to an aq other than pqs in p. aeruginosa.
