BACKGROUND
shaker codes for a drosophila voltage-dependent potassium channel. flies carrying shaker null or hypomorphic mutations sleep 3– <dig> h/day instead of 8– <dig> h/day as their wild-type siblings do. shaker-like channels are conserved across species but it is unknown whether they affect sleep in mammals. to address this issue, we studied sleep in kcna <dig> knockout  mice. kcna <dig> codes for kv <dig> , the alpha subunit of a shaker-like voltage-dependent potassium channel with high expression in the mammalian thalamocortical system.


RESULTS
continuous  electroencephalograph , electromyogram , and video recordings were used to measure sleep and waking in kcna <dig> ko, heterozygous  and wild-type  pups  and hz and wt adult mice . sleep stages were scored visually based on 4-s epochs. eeg power spectra  were calculated on consecutive 4-s epochs. ko pups die by p <dig> due to generalized seizures. at p <dig> seizures are either absent or very rare in ko pups , and abnormal eeg activity is only present during the seizure. ko pups have significantly less non-rapid eye movement  sleep  and significantly more waking  than hz and wt siblings with no change in rapid eye movement  sleep time. the decrease in nrem sleep is due to an increase in the number of waking episodes, with no change in number or duration of sleep episodes. sleep patterns, daily amounts of sleep and waking, and the response to  <dig> h sleep deprivation are similar in hz and wt adult mice.


CONCLUSIONS
kv <dig> , a mammalian homologue of shaker, regulates neuronal excitability and affects nrem sleep.
