BACKGROUND
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase  is a critical enzyme catalyzing the Î²-carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate  to oxaloacetate, a tricarboxylic acid  cycle intermediate. pepc typically exists as a class- <dig> pepc homotetramer composed of plant-type pepc  polypeptides, and two of the subunits were reported to be monoubiquitinated in germinating castor oil seeds. by the large-scale purification of ubiquitin -related proteins from lily anther, two types of pepcs, bacterial-type pepc  and plant-type pepc , were identified in our study as candidate ub-related proteins. until now, there has been no information about the properties of the pepcs expressed in male reproductive tissues of higher plants.


RESULTS
expression analyses showed that lily btpc  and arabidopsis btpc  were significantly expressed in pollen. the fusion protein atbtpc-venus localized in the cytoplasm of the vegetative cell . both llbtpc and atbtpc expression initiated after the last mitosis before pollen germination. lily ptpc  and monoubiquitinated llptpc  remained at constant levels during pollen development. in late bicellular pollen of lily, llbtpc forms a hetero-octameric class- <dig> pepc complex with llptpc to express pepc activity.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that an llbtpc:ub-llptpc:llptpc complex is formed in the vc cytoplasm during late pollen development. both llbtpc and atbtpc expression patterns are similar to the patterns of the appearance of storage organelles during pollen development in lily and arabidopsis, respectively. therefore, btpc is thought to accelerate the metabolic flow for the synthesis of storage substances during pollen maturation. our study provides the first characterization of btpc in pollen, the male gametophyte of higher plants.
