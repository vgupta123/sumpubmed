BACKGROUND
currently, the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus  of the subtype h5n <dig> is believed to have reached an endemic cycle in vietnam. we used routine surveillance data on hpaiv h5n <dig> poultry outbreaks in vietnam to estimate and compare the within-flock reproductive number of infection  for periods before  and during  vaccination.


RESULTS
our results show that infected premises  in the initial  phases of outbreak periods have the highest r <dig> estimates. the ips reported during the outbreak period when depopulation-based disease control was implemented had higher r <dig> estimates than ips reported during the outbreak period when vaccination-based disease control was used. in the latter period, in some flocks of a defined size and species composition, within-flock transmission estimates were not significantly below the threshold for transmission .


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the current control policy based on depopulation plus vaccination has protected the majority of poultry flocks against infection. however, in some flocks the determinants associated with suboptimal protection need to be further investigated as these may explain the current pattern of infection in animal and human populations.
