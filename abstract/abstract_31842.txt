BACKGROUND
upon appropriate stimulation, plants increase their level of resistance against future pathogen attack. this phenomenon, known as induced resistance, presents an adaptive advantage due to its reduced fitness costs and its systemic and broad-spectrum nature. in arabidopsis, different types of induced resistance have been defined based on the signaling pathways involved, particularly those dependent on salicylic acid  and/or jasmonic acid .


RESULTS
here, we have assessed the implication of the transcriptional regulator ocp <dig> in sa- and ja-dependent induced defenses. through a series of double mutant analyses, we conclude that sa-dependent defense signaling does not require ocp <dig>  however, we found that ocp <dig> plants are impaired in a pseudomonas fluorescens wcs417r-triggered induced systemic resistance  against both pseudomonas syrinagae dc <dig> and hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, and we show that this impairment is not due to a defect in ja-perception. likewise, exogenous application of ja failed to induce defenses in ocp <dig> plants. in addition, we provide evidence showing that the over-expression of an engineered cytosolic isoform of the disease resistance regulator npr <dig> restores the impaired ja-induced disease resistance in ocp <dig> plants.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings point to a model in which ocp <dig> may modulate the nucleocytosolic function of npr <dig> in the regulation of ja-dependent induced defense responses.
