BACKGROUND
high-throughput sequencing  technologies are spearheading the accelerated development of biomedical research. processing and summarizing the large amount of data generated by hts presents a non-trivial challenge to bioinformatics. a commonly adopted standard is to store sequencing reads aligned to a reference genome in sam  or bam  files. quality control of sam/bam files is a critical checkpoint before downstream analysis. the goal of the current project is to facilitate and standardize this process.


RESULTS
we developed bamchop, a robust program to efficiently summarize key statistical metrics of hts data stored in bam files, and to visually present the results in a formatted report. the report documents information about various aspects of hts data, such as sequencing quality, mapping to a reference genome, sequencing coverage, and base frequency. bamchop uses the r language and bioconductor packages to calculate statistical matrices and the sweave utility and associated latex markup for documentation. bamchop's efficiency and robustness were tested on bam files generated by local sequencing facilities and the  <dig> genomes project. source code, instruction and example reports of bamchop are freely available from https://github.com/cbmi-big/bamchop.


CONCLUSIONS
bamchop enables biomedical researchers to quickly and rigorously evaluate hts data by providing a convenient synopsis and user-friendly reports.
