BACKGROUND
in the silkworm, bombyx mori, femaleness is strongly controlled by the female-specific w chromosome. originally, it was presumed that the w chromosome encodes female-determining gene, accordingly called fem. however, to date, neither fem nor any protein-coding gene has been identified from the w chromosome. instead, the w chromosome is occupied with numerous transposon-related sequences. interestingly, the silkworm w chromosome is a source of female-enriched piwi-interacting rnas . pirnas are small rnas of 23- <dig> nucleotides in length, which are required for controlling transposon activity in animal gonads. a recent study has identified a novel mutant silkworm line called kg, whose mutation in the w chromosome causes severe female masculinization. however, the molecular nature of kg line has not been well characterized yet.


RESULTS
here we molecularly characterize the kg line. genomic pcr analyses using currently available w chromosome-specific pcr markers indicated that no large deletion existed in the kg w chromosome. genetic analyses demonstrated that sib-crosses within the kg line suppressed masculinization. masculinization reactivated when crossing kg females with wild type males. importantly, the kg ovaries exhibited a significantly abnormal transcriptome. first, the kg ovaries misexpressed testis-specific genes. second, a set of female-enriched pirnas was downregulated in the kg ovaries. third, several transposons were overexpressed in the kg ovaries.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, the mutation in the kg w chromosome causes broadly altered expression of testis-specific genes, pirnas, and transposons. to our knowledge, this is the first study that describes a w chromosome mutant with such an intriguing phenotype.
