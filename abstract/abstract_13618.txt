BACKGROUND
glutamate is one of the major neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. it is a potent neurotoxin capable of neuronal destruction through numerous signal pathways when present in high concentration. glutamate-evoked excitotoxicity has been implicated in the etiology of many neurodegenerative diseases including alzheimer’s disease , parkinson’s disease , and ischemic stroke. increasing evidence has shown that reactive oxygen species  provoked by glutamate-linked oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. we previously reported the discovery of an aryl thiophene compound, 4-chloro-n--5-phenoxy)thiophene-2-sulfonamide  from a proprietary library of small molecules. we showed that this compound was capable of potentiating nerve growth factor -primed neurite outgrowth in neuronal cell models in a low ngf environment. in the present study we investigated the neuroprotective effects and signaling pathways of b <dig> on glutamate-evoked excitotoxicity in ht- <dig>  a murine hippocampal neuronal cell line.


RESULTS
glutamate significantly decreased ht- <dig> neuronal cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner as measured by the mtt assay. co-treatment with  <dig>   <dig>  and 8 μm b <dig> protected against cell death caused by glutamate-induced toxicity by  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  respectively, compared to glutamate-treated control group. b <dig> at a concentration of 8 μm fully rescued ht- <dig> from the neurototoxic effects of glutamate, and by itself increased cell viability by 16%  above untreated control. glutamate enhanced reduction in glutathione  synthesis was reversed by 15%  in the presence of b <dig>  b <dig> reduced the expression of apoptosis inducing factor  by 27%, while the proapoptotic bcl- <dig> associated x protein  was strongly attenuated 3-fold. glutamate-evoked increase in intracellular calcium  load and subsequent ros production was inhibited by 71%  and 40%  respectively, to comparable level as untreated control in the presence of b <dig>  glutamate significantly upregulated the phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase erk1/ <dig> , while decreasing erk <dig>  in contrast, b <dig> potently attenuated the glutamate-dependent activation of erk1/ <dig> and robustly increased the level of erk <dig> in ht- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
a novel phenoxy thiophene small molecule, b <dig>  suppresses glutamate-evoked oxidative stress in ht- <dig> neurons by blocking ca2+ and ros production, and altering the expression or phosphorylation states of erk kinases. this molecule previously reported to enhance neurite outgrowth in the presence of sub-physiological concentrations of ngf appears to be a promising drug candidate for development as a potential therapeutic and neuroprotective agent for various neurodegenerative disorders.
