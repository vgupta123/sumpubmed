BACKGROUND
termination of translation in eukaryotes requires two release factors, erf <dig>  which recognizes all three nonsense codons and facilitates release of the nascent polypeptide chain, and erf <dig> stimulating translation termination in a gtp-depended manner. erf <dig> from different organisms possess a highly conservative c region , which is responsible for the function in translation termination, and almost always contain the n-terminal extension, which is inessential and vary both in structure and length. in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae the n-terminal region of erf <dig> is responsible for conversion of this protein into the aggregated and functionally inactive prion form.


RESULTS
here, we examined functional importance of the n-terminal region of a non-prion form of yeast erf <dig>  the screen for mutations which are lethal in combination with the sup35-c allele encoding erf3c revealed the sup <dig> mutations which alter the n-terminal domain of erf <dig> and increase nonsense codon readthrough. however, further analysis showed that synthetic lethality was not caused by the increased levels of nonsense codon readthrough. dominant mutations in sup35-c were obtained and characterized, which remove its synthetic lethality with the identified sup <dig> mutations, thus indicating that synthetic lethality was not due to a disruption of interaction with proteins that bind to this erf <dig> region.


CONCLUSIONS
these and other data demonstrate that the n-terminal region of erf <dig> is involved both in modulation of the efficiency of translation termination and functioning of the erf1/erf <dig> complex outside of translation termination.
