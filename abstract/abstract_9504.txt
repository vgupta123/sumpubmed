BACKGROUND
present study focuses on diversity and distribution analysis of endophytic fungi associated with different tissues of the monarda citriodora cerv. ex lag. . anticancer and antimicrobial potential of isolated endophytes have also been investigated.


RESULTS
a total of twenty eight fungal endophytes belonging to  <dig> different genera were isolated from this plant. all the endophytic fungi belonged to the ascomycota phylum. the leaves were immensely rich in fungal species, while roots showed the highest tissue specific fungal dominance. out of  <dig> fungal species, 72% endophytic extracts were found cytotoxic against one or more human cancer cell lines. the most prominent anticancer activity  was shown by mc-14 l , mc-14 f , mc-18 l , mc-24 l , mc-25 l , mc-26 f  extracts. 75% of the extracts showed antimicrobial activities in agar disc-diffusion assay and 27% in the tube dilution method  respectively against the tested pathogens. extracts of mc-14 l  and mc-18 l  displayed broad spectrum antimicrobial activity.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicated that m. citriodora harbors a rich fungal endophytic community with anticancer and antimicrobial activities. the isolated endophyte mc-24 l  has the potential to be a source of novel cytotoxic/antimicrobial compounds. this is the first report of diversity of fungal endophytes isolated from m. citriodora.
