BACKGROUND
like mammalian map kinases, the mating-specific fus <dig> mapk of yeast accumulates in the nuclei of stimulated cells. because fus <dig> does not appear to be subjected to active nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, it is not clear how its activation by mating pheromone effects the observed change in its localization. one possibility is that the activation of fus <dig> changes its affinity for nuclear and cytoplasmic tethers.


RESULTS
dig <dig>  dig <dig>  and ste <dig> are nuclear proteins that interact with fus <dig>  we found that the pheromone-induced nuclear accumulation of a fus3-gfp reporter is reduced in cells lacking dig <dig> or dig <dig>  whereas fus3t180ay182a-gfp localization was unaffected by the absence of these proteins. this suggests that dig <dig> and dig <dig> contribute to the retention of phosphorylated fus <dig> in the nucleus. moreover, overexpression of ste <dig> caused the hyper-accumulation of fus3-gfp  in the nuclei of pheromone-treated cells, suggesting that ste <dig> also plays a role in the nuclear retention of phosphorylated fus <dig>  either by directly interacting with it or by transcribing genes whose protein products are fus <dig> tethers. we have previously reported that overexpression of the msg <dig> phosphatase inhibits the nuclear localization of fus <dig>  here we show that this effect depends on the phosphatase activity of msg <dig>  and provide evidence that both nuclear and cytoplasmic msg <dig> can affect the localization of fus <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our data are consistent with a model in which the pheromone-induced phosphorylation of fus <dig> increases its affinity for nuclear tethers, which contributes to its nuclear accumulation and is antagonized by msg <dig>
