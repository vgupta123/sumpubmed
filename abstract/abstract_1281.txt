BACKGROUND
in arabidopsis thaliana  the wd <dig> protein transparent testa glabra <dig>  controls five traits relevant for the adaptation of plants to environmental changes including the production of proanthocyanidin, anthocyanidin, seed coat mucilage, trichomes and root hairs. the analysis of different brassicaceae species suggests that the function of ttg <dig> is conserved within the family.


RESULTS
in this work, we studied the function of ttg <dig> in arabis alpina . a comparison of wild type and two aattg <dig> alleles revealed that aattg <dig> is involved in the regulation of all five traits. a detailed analysis of the five traits showed striking phenotypic differences between a. alpina and a. thaliana such that trichome formation occurs also at later stages of leaf development and that root hairs form at non-root hair positions.


CONCLUSIONS
the evolutionary conservation of the regulation of the five traits by ttg <dig> on the one hand and the striking phenotypic differences make a. alpina a very interesting genetic model system to study the evolution of ttg1-dependent gene regulatory networks at a functional level.
