BACKGROUND
single-cell rna sequencing is fast becoming one the standard method for gene expression measurement, providing unique insights into cellular processes. a number of methods, based on general dimensionality reduction techniques, have been suggested to help infer and visualise the underlying structure of cell populations from single-cell expression levels, yet their models generally lack proper biological grounding and struggle at identifying complex differentiation paths.


RESULTS
here we introduce celltree: an r/bioconductor package that uses a novel statistical approach, based on document analysis techniques, to produce tree structures outlining the hierarchical relationship between single-cell samples, while identifying latent groups of genes that can provide biological insights.


CONCLUSIONS
with celltree, we provide experimentalists with an easy-to-use tool, based on statistically and biologically-sound algorithms, to efficiently explore and visualise single-cell rna data. the celltree package is publicly available in the online bionconductor repository at: http://bioconductor.org/packages/celltree/.
