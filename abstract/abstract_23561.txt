BACKGROUND
coordinated chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation are required for normal endochondral bone growth. transcription factors binding to the cyclicamp response element  are known to regulate these processes. one member of this family, activating tanscription factor  <dig> , is expressed during skeletogenesis and acts as a transcriptional repressor, but the function of this protein in chondrogenesis is unknown.


RESULTS
here we demonstrate that atf <dig> mrna levels increase during mouse chondrocyte differentiation in vitro and in vivo. in addition, atf <dig> mrna levels are increased in response to cytochalasin d treatment, an inducer of chondrocyte maturation. this is accompanied by increased atf <dig> promoter activity in cytochalasin d-treated chondrocytes. we had shown earlier that transcription of the cell cycle genes cyclin d <dig> and cyclin a in chondrocytes is dependent on cres. here we demonstrate that overexpression of atf <dig> in primary mouse chondrocytes results in reduced transcription of both genes, as well as decreased activity of a cre reporter plasmid. repression of cyclin a transcription by atf <dig> required the cre in the cyclin a promoter. in parallel, atf <dig> overexpression reduces the activity of a sox9-dependent promoter and increases the activity of a runx2-dependent promoter.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that transcriptional induction of the atf <dig> gene in maturing chondrocytes results in down-regulation of cyclin d <dig> and cyclin a expression as well as activation of runx2-dependent transcription. therefore, atf <dig> induction appears to facilitate cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation of chondrocytes.
