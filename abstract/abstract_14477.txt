BACKGROUND
the western burrowing owl  occurs throughout western north america in various habitats such as desert, short-grass prairie and shrub-steppe, among others, where the main threat for this species is habitat loss. range-wide declines have prompted a need for reliable estimates of its populations in mexico, where the size of resident and migratory populations remain unknown.


RESULTS
our objective was to estimate the abundance and density of breeding western burrowing owl populations in mexican prairie dog  colonies in two sites located within the chihuahuan desert ecoregion in the states of nuevo leon and san luis potosi, mexico. line transect surveys were conducted from february to april of  <dig> and  <dig>  fifty 60 ha transects were analyzed using distance sampling to estimate owl and mexican prairie dog populations. we estimated a population of  <dig> owls  in  <dig> and  <dig> owls  in  <dig> across  <dig> mexican prairie dog colonies .


CONCLUSIONS
the results represent the first systematic attempt to provide reliable evidence related to the size of the adult owl populations, within the largest and best preserved mexican prairie dog colonies in mexico.
