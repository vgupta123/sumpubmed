BACKGROUND
recent advances in web and information technologies with the increasing decentralization of organizational structures have resulted in massive amounts of information resources and domain-specific services in traditional chinese medicine. the massive volume and diversity of information and services available have made it difficult to achieve seamless and interoperable e-science for knowledge-intensive disciplines like tcm. therefore, information integration and service coordination are two major challenges in e-science for tcm. we still lack sophisticated approaches to integrate scientific data and services for tcm e-science.


RESULTS
we present a comprehensive approach to build dynamic and extendable e-science applications for knowledge-intensive disciplines like tcm based on semantic and knowledge-based techniques. the semantic e-science infrastructure for tcm supports large-scale database integration and service coordination in a virtual organization. we use domain ontologies to integrate tcm database resources and services in a semantic cyberspace and deliver a semantically superior experience including browsing, searching, querying and knowledge discovering to users. we have developed a collection of semantic-based toolkits to facilitate tcm scientists and researchers in information sharing and collaborative research.


CONCLUSIONS
semantic and knowledge-based techniques are suitable to knowledge-intensive disciplines like tcm. it's possible to build on-demand e-science system for tcm based on existing semantic and knowledge-based techniques. the presented approach in the paper integrates heterogeneous distributed tcm databases and services, and provides scientists with semantically superior experience to support collaborative research in tcm discipline.
