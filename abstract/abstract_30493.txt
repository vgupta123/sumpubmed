BACKGROUND
calculating the electrostatic surface potential  of a biomolecule is critical towards understanding biomolecular function. because of its quadratic computational complexity , there have been continual efforts to reduce its complexity either by improving the algorithm or the underlying hardware on which the calculations are performed.


RESULTS
we present the combined effect of  a multi-scale approximation algorithm, known as hierarchical charge partitioning , when applied to the calculation of esp and  its mapping onto a graphics processing unit . to date, most molecular modeling algorithms perform an artificial partitioning of biomolecules into a grid/lattice on the gpu. in contrast, hcp takes advantage of the natural partitioning in biomolecules, which in turn, better facilitates its mapping onto the gpu. specifically, we characterize the effect of known gpu optimization techniques like use of shared memory. in addition, we demonstrate how the cost of divergent branching on a gpu can be amortized across algorithms like hcp in order to deliver a massive performance boon.


CONCLUSIONS
we accelerated the calculation of esp by 25-fold solely by parallelization on the gpu. combining gpu and hcp, resulted in a speedup of at most  <dig> -fold for our largest molecular structure. the baseline for these speedups is an implementation that has been hand-tuned sse-optimized and parallelized across  <dig> cores on the cpu. the use of gpu does not deteriorate the accuracy of our results.
