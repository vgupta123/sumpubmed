BACKGROUND
spontaneous canine mammary tumors constitute a serious clinical problem. there are significant differences in survival between cases with different tumor grades. unfortunately, the distinction between various grades is not clear. a major problem in evaluating canine mammary cancer is identifying those, that are “truly” malignant. that is why the aim of our study was to find the new markers of canine malignancy, which could help to diagnose the most malignant tumors.


RESULTS
analysis of gene expression profiles of canine mammary carcinoma of various grade of malignancy followed by the boosted tree analysis distinguished a `gene set`. the expression of this gene set  differs significantly in the most malignant tumors at mrna level as well as at protein level. despite this `gene set` is very interesting as an additional tool to estimate canine mammary malignancy, it should be validated using higher number of samples.


CONCLUSIONS
the proposed gene set can constitute a `malignancy marker` that could help to distinguish the most malignant canine mammary carcinomas. these genes are also interesting as targets for further investigations and therapy. so far, only two of them were linked with the cancer development.
