BACKGROUND
neural precursor cells  can be isolated from various regions of the postnatal central nervous system . manipulation of gene expression in these cells offers a promising strategy to manipulate their fate both in vitro and in vivo. in this study, we developed a technique that allows the transient manipulation of single/multiple gene expression in npcs in vitro, and the long-term tracking of their progeny both in vitro and in vivo.


RESULTS
in order to combine the advantages of transient transfection with the long-term tracking of the transfected cells progeny, we developed a new approach based on the cre-lox technology. we first established a fast and reliable protocol to isolate and culture npcs as monolayer, from the spinal cord of neonatal transgenic rosa26-yfp cre-reporter mice. these cells could be reliably transfected with single/multiple plasmids by nucleofection. nucleofection with mono- or bicistronic plasmids containing the cre recombinase gene resulted in efficient recombination and the long-term expression of the yfp-reporter gene. the transient cre-expression was non-toxic for the transfected cells and did not alter their intrinsic properties. finally, we demonstrated that cre-transfected cells could be transplanted into the adult brain, where they maintained yfp expression permitting long-term tracking of their migration and differentiation.


CONCLUSIONS
this approach allows single/multiple genes to be manipulated in npcs, while at the same time allowing long-term tracking of the transfected cells progeny to be analyzed both in vitro and in vivo.
