BACKGROUND
combination of chd -specific polymerase chain reaction  with electrophoresis  is the most common avian molecular sexing technique but it is lab-intensive and gel-required. gender determination often fails when the difference in length between the pcr products of chd-z and chd-w genes is too short to be resolved.


RESULTS
here, we are the first to introduce a pcr-melting curve analysis  to identify the gender of birds by genomic dna, which is gel-free, quick, and inexpensive. spilornis cheela hoya  and pycnonotus sinensis  were used to illustrate this novel molecular sexing technique. the difference in the length of chd genes in s. c. hoya and p. sinensis is 13-, and 52-bp, respectively. using griffiths' p2/p <dig> primers, molecular sexing failed both in pcr/electrophoresis of s. c. hoya and in pcr/mca of s. c. hoya and p. sinensis. in contrast, we redesigned sex-specific primers to yield 185- and 112-bp pcr products for the chd-z and chd-w genes of s. c. hoya, respectively, using pcr/mca. using this specific primer set, at least  <dig> samples of s. c. hoya were examined simultaneously and the tm peaks of chd-z and chd-w pcr products were distinguished.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we introduced a high-throughput avian molecular sexing technique and successfully applied it to two species. this new method holds a great potential for use in high throughput sexing of other avian species, as well.
