BACKGROUND
microarrays are commonly used to investigate both the therapeutic potential and functional effects of rna interfering  oligonucleotides such as microrna  and small interfering rna . however, the resulting datasets are often challenging to interpret as they include extensive information relating to both indirect transcription effects and off-target interference events.

method
in an attempt to refine the utility of microarray expression data when evaluating the direct transcriptional affects of an rnai agent we have developed sbse . the key assumption implemented in sbse is that both direct regulation of transcription by mirna, and sirna off-target interference, can be estimated using the differential distribution of an rnai sequence  motif in a ranked 3' untranslated region  sequence repository. sbse uses common microarray summary statistics  and a simple bayesian analysis to estimate how the rnai agent dictated the observed differential expression profile. on completion a trace of the estimate and the location of the optimal partitioning of the dataset are plotted within a simple graphical representation of the 3'utr landscape. the combined estimates define the differential distribution of the query motif within the dataset and by inference are used to quantify the magnitude of the direct rnai transcription effect.


RESULTS
sbse has been evaluated using five diverse human rnai microarray focused investigations. in each instance sbse unambiguously identified the most likely location of the direct rnai effects for each of the differential gene expression profiles.


CONCLUSIONS
these analyses indicate that mirna with conserved seed regions may share minimal biological activity and that sbse can be used to differentiate sirnas of similar efficacy but with different off-target signalling potential.
