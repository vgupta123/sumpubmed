BACKGROUND
expression of intracellular antibodies  has become a broadly applicable technology for generation of phenotypic knockouts in vivo. the method uses surface depletion of cellular membrane proteins to examine their biological function. in this study, we used this strategy to block the transport of cell surface molecule cd <dig> to the cell membrane. phage display technology was introduced to generate the functional antibody fragment to cd <dig>  and we subsequently constructed a cd147-specific scfv that was expressed intracellularly and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum by adenoviral gene transfer.


RESULTS
the recombinant antibody fragments, fab and scfv, of the murine monoclonal antibody  reacted specifically to cd <dig> by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays  using a recombinant cd147-bccp as a target. this indicated that the fab- and scfv-m6-1b <dig> displaying on phage surfaces were correctly folded and functionally active. we subsequently constructed a cd147-specific scfv, scfv-m6-1b9-intrabody, in 293a cells. the expression of cd <dig> on 293a cell surface was monitored at  <dig> h after transduction by flow cytometry and demonstrated remarkable reduction. colocalization of scfv-m6-1b <dig> intrabody with cd <dig> in the er network was depicted using a 3d deconvolution microscopy system.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that our approach can generate antibody fragments suitable for decreasing the expression of cd <dig> on 293a cells. this study represents a step toward understanding the role of the cell surface protein, cd <dig>
