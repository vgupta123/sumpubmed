BACKGROUND
the prevalence of resistance to fusidic acid of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  was increased each year in a taiwan hospital. thirty-four mrsa clinical isolates collected in  <dig> and  <dig> with reduced susceptibility to fa were selected for further evaluation the presence of resistance determinants.


RESULTS
the most common resistance determinant was fusc, found in  <dig> of the  <dig> mrsa isolates. one of the  <dig> fusidic acid-resistant mrsa harboured both fusb and fusc, which is the first time this has been identified. mutations in fusa were found in  <dig> strains, a total of  <dig> amino-acid substitutions in ef-g  were detected. two substitutions with g556s and r659l were identified for the first time. low-level resistance to fusidic acid  was found in most our collection. all collected isolates carried type iii sccmec elements. mlst showed the isolates were mrsa st <dig>  pfge revealed nine different pulsotypes in one cluster.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the increase in the number of fusidic acid resistant among the mrsa isolates in this hospital is due mainly to the distribution of fusc determinants. moreover, more than one fusidic acid-resistance mechanism was first detected in a same stain in our collection.
