BACKGROUND
drug resistance has become a severe challenge for treatment of hiv infections. mutations accumulate in the hiv genome and make certain drugs ineffective. prediction of resistance from genotype data is a valuable guide in choice of drugs for effective therapy.


RESULTS
in order to improve the computational prediction of resistance from genotype data we have developed a unified encoding of the protein sequence and three-dimensional protein structure of the drug target for classification and regression analysis. the method was tested on genotype-resistance data for mutants of hiv protease and reverse transcriptase. our graph based sequence-structure approach gives high accuracy with a new sparse dictionary classification method, as well as support vector machine and artificial neural networks classifiers. cross-validated regression analysis with the sparse dictionary gave excellent correlation between predicted and observed resistance.


CONCLUSIONS
the approach of encoding the protein structure and sequence as a 210-dimensional vector, based on delaunay triangulation, has promise as an accurate method for predicting resistance from sequence for drugs inhibiting hiv protease and reverse transcriptase.
