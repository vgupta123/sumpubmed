BACKGROUND
eggshell is subject to quality loss with aging process of laying hens, and damaged eggshells result in economic losses of eggs. however, the genetic architecture underlying the dynamic eggshell quality remains elusive. here, we measured eggshell quality traits, including eggshell weight , eggshell thickness  and eggshell strength  at  <dig> time points from onset of laying to  <dig> weeks of age and conducted comprehensive genome-wide association studies  in 1534 f <dig> hens derived from reciprocal crosses between white leghorn  and dongxiang chickens .


RESULTS
esws at all ages exhibited moderate snp-based heritability estimates , while the estimates for est  and ess  were relatively low. eleven independent univariate genome-wide screens for each trait totally identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> significant associations with esw, est and ess, respectively. most significant loci were in a region spanning from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb of chromosome  <dig> , which together account for  <dig>  ~  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variance for esw from  <dig> to  <dig> weeks of age,  <dig>  ~  <dig>  % and  <dig>  ~  <dig>  % for est and ess from  <dig> to  <dig> weeks of age. according to linkage disequilibrium  and conditional analysis, the significant snps in this region were in extremely strong linkage disequilibrium status. ultimately, two missense snps in gga <dig> and one in gga <dig> were considered as promising loci on three independent genes including itpr <dig>  pik3c2g, and ncapg. the homozygotes of advantageously effective alleles on pik3c2g and itpr <dig> possessed the best eggshell quality and could partly counteract the negative effect of aging process. ncapg had certain effect on eggshell quality for young hens.


CONCLUSIONS
identification of the promising region as well as potential candidate genes will greatly advance our understanding of the genetic basis underlying dynamic eggshell quality and has the practical significance in breeding program for the improvement of eggshell quality, especially at the later part of laying cycle.
