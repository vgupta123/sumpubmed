BACKGROUND
 <dig> -dichlorobenzene  is a benzene-derived molecule with two cl atoms that is commonly utilized in the synthesis of pesticides.  <dig> -dcb can be absorbed by living creatures and its effects on naturally-occurring enzymatic systems, including the effects on ca2+-atpases, have been poorly studied. therefore, we aimed to study the effect of  <dig> -dcb on the ca2+-atpase from sarcoplasmic reticulum , a critical regulator of intracellular ca2+ concentration.


RESULTS
concentrations of  <dig> – <dig>  mm of  <dig> -dcb were able to stimulate the hydrolytic activity of serca in a medium-containing ca2+-ionophore. at higher concentrations ,  <dig> -dcb inhibited the atp hydrolysis to ~80 %. moreover, atp hydrolysis and ca2+ uptake in a medium supported by k-oxalate showed that starting at  <dig>  mm, <dig> -dcb was able to uncouple the ratio of hydrolysis/ca2+ transported. the effect of this compound on the integrity of the sr membrane loaded with ca2+ remained unaffected. finally, the analysis of phosphorylation of serca by atp, starting under different conditions at 0° or 25 °c showed a reduction in the phosphoenzyme levels by  <dig> -dcb, mostly at 0 °c.


CONCLUSIONS
the temperature-dependent decreased levels of phosphoenzyme by  <dig> -dcb could be due to the acceleration of the dephosphorylation mechanism – e2p · ca <dig> state to e <dig> and pi, which explains the uncoupling of the atp hydrolysis from the ca2+ transport.
