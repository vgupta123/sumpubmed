BACKGROUND
rye is an important european crop used for food, feed, and bioenergy. several quality and yield-related traits are of agronomic relevance for rye breeding programs. profound knowledge of the genetic architecture of these traits is needed to successfully implement marker-assisted selection programs. nevertheless, little is known on quantitative loci underlying important agronomic traits in rye.


RESULTS
we used  <dig> f3: <dig> inbred lines from two biparental populations  fingerprinted with about  <dig> to  <dig> snp, ssr and/or dart markers and outcrossed them to a tester for phenotyping. the resulting hybrids and their parents were evaluated for grain yield, single-ear weight, test weight, plant height, thousand-kernel weight, falling number, protein, starch, soluble and total pentosan contents in up to ten environments in central europe. the quality of the phenotypic data was high reflected by moderate to high heritability estimates. qtl analyses revealed a total of  <dig> qtl for pop-a and  <dig> for pop-b. qtl x environment interactions were significant  in most cases but variance of qtl main effect was more prominent.


CONCLUSIONS
qtl mapping was successfully applied based on two segregating rye populations. qtl underlying grain yield and several quality traits had small effects. in contrast, thousand-kernel weight, test weight, falling number and starch content were affected by several major qtl with a high frequency of occurrence in cross validation. these qtl explaining a large proportion of the genotypic variance can be exploited in marker-assisted selection programs and are candidates for further genetic dissection.
