BACKGROUND
the archaeon, methanosarcina acetivorans strain c2a forms methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from a variety of one-carbon substrates and acetate. whereas the biochemical pathways leading to methane formation are well understood, little is known about the expression of the many of the genes that encode proteins needed for carbon flow, electron transfer and/or energy conservation. quantitative transcript analysis was performed on twenty gene clusters encompassing over one hundred genes in m. acetivorans that encode enzymes/proteins with known or potential roles in substrate conversion to methane.


RESULTS
the expression of many seemingly "redundant" genes/gene clusters establish substrate dependent control of approximately seventy genes for methane production by the pathways for methanol and acetate utilization. these include genes for soluble-type and membrane-type heterodisulfide reductases , hydrogenases including genes for a vht-type f <dig> non-reducing hydrogenase, molybdenum-type  as well as tungsten-type  formylmethanofuran dehydrogenases, genes for rnf and mrp-type electron transfer complexes, for acetate uptake, plus multiple genes for aha- and atp-type atp synthesis complexes. analysis of promoters for seven gene clusters reveal utr leaders of 51- <dig> nucleotides in length, raising the possibility of both transcriptional and translational levels of control.


CONCLUSIONS
the above findings establish the differential and coordinated expression of two major gene families in m. acetivorans in response to carbon/energy supply. furthermore, the quantitative mrna measurements demonstrate the dynamic range for modulating transcript abundance. since many of these gene clusters in m. acetivorans are also present in other methanosarcina species including m. mazei, and in m. barkeri, these findings provide a basis for predicting related control in these environmentally significant methanogens.
