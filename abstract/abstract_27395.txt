BACKGROUND
the cancer genome atlas  is a pool of molecular data sets publicly accessible and freely available to cancer researchers anywhere around the world. however, wide spread use is limited since an advanced knowledge of statistics and statistical software is required.


RESULTS
in order to improve accessibility we created web-tcga, a web based, freely accessible online tool, which can also be run in a private instance, for integrated analysis of molecular cancer data sets provided by tcga. in contrast to already available tools, web-tcga utilizes different methods for analysis and visualization of tcga data, allowing users to generate global molecular profiles across different cancer entities simultaneously. in addition to global molecular profiles, web-tcga offers highly detailed gene and tumor entity centric analysis by providing interactive tables and views.


CONCLUSIONS
as a supplement to other already available tools, such as cbioportal , web-tcga is offering an analysis service, which does not require any installation or configuration, for molecular data sets available at the tcga. individual processing requests  are generated by the user for mutation, methylation, expression and copy number variation  analyses. the user can focus analyses on results from single genes and cancer entities or perform a global analysis .
