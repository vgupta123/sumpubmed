BACKGROUND
different cupriavidus metallidurans strains isolated from metal-contaminated and other anthropogenic environments were genotypically and phenotypically compared with c. metallidurans type strain ch <dig>  the latter is well-studied for its resistance to a wide range of metals, which is carried for a substantial part by its two megaplasmids pmol <dig> and pmol <dig> 


RESULTS
comparative genomic hybridization  indicated that the extensive arsenal of determinants involved in metal resistance was well conserved among the different c. metallidurans strains. contrary, the mobile genetic elements identified in type strain ch <dig> were not present in all strains but clearly showed a pattern, although, not directly related to a particular biotope nor location . one group of strains carried almost all mobile genetic elements, while these were much less abundant in the second group. this occurrence was also reflected in their ability to degrade toluene and grow autotrophically on hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide, which are two traits linked to separate genomic islands of the tn4371-family. in addition, the clear pattern of genomic islands distribution allowed to identify new putative genomic islands on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> of c. metallidurans ch <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
metal resistance determinants are shared by all c. metallidurans strains and their occurrence is apparently irrespective of the strain's isolation type and place. cupriavidus metallidurans strains do display substantial differences in the diversity and size of their mobile gene pool, which may be extensive in some  while marginal in others.
