BACKGROUND
common structural biology methods  often produce ensembles of molecular structures. consequently, averaging of 3d coordinates of molecular structures  is a frequent approach to obtain a consensus structure that is representative of the ensemble. however, when the structures are averaged, artifacts can result in unrealistic local geometries, including unphysical bond lengths and angles.


RESULTS
herein, we describe a method to derive representative structures while limiting the number of artifacts. our approach is based on a monte carlo simulation technique that drives a starting structure  towards the 'averaged structure' using a harmonic pseudo energy function. to assess the performance of the algorithm, we applied our approach to cα models of  <dig> proteins generated by the tasser structure prediction algorithm. the average rmsd of the refined model from the native structure for the set becomes worse by a mere  <dig>  Å compared to the average rmsd of the averaged structures from the native structure . however, the percentage of atoms involved in clashes is greatly reduced ; in fact, the majority of the refined proteins had zero clashes. moreover, a small number  of refined structures resulted in lower rmsd to the native protein versus the averaged structure. finally, compared to pulchra  <cit> , our approach produces representative structure of similar rmsd quality, but with much fewer clashes.


CONCLUSIONS
the benchmarking results demonstrate that our approach for removing averaging artifacts can be very beneficial for the structural biology community. furthermore, the same approach can be applied to almost any problem where averaging of 3d coordinates is performed. namely, structure averaging is also commonly performed in rna secondary prediction  <cit> , which could also benefit from our approach.
