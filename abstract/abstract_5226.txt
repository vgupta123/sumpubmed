BACKGROUND
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses  comprise at least eight genetically characterized neurodegenerative disorders of childhood. despite of genetic heterogeneity, the high similarity of clinical symptoms and pathology of different ncl disorders suggest cooperation between different ncl proteins and common mechanisms of pathogenesis. here, we have studied molecular interactions between ncl proteins, concentrating specifically on the interactions of cln <dig>  the protein underlying the finnish variant late infantile form of ncl .


RESULTS
we found that cln <dig> interacts with several other ncl proteins namely, cln1/ppt <dig>  cln2/tpp <dig>  cln <dig>  cln <dig> and cln <dig>  furthermore, analysis of the intracellular targeting of cln <dig> together with the interacting ncl proteins revealed that over-expression of ppt <dig> can facilitate the lysosomal transport of mutated cln5finmajor, normally residing in the er and in the golgi complex. the significance of the novel interaction between cln <dig> and ppt <dig> was further supported by the finding that cln <dig> was also able to bind the f1-atpase, earlier shown to interact with ppt <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we have described novel interactions between cln <dig> and several ncl proteins, suggesting a modifying role for these proteins in the pathogenesis of individual ncl disorders. among these novel interactions, binding of cln <dig> to cln1/ppt <dig> is suggested to be the most significant one, since over-expression of ppt <dig> was shown to influence on the intracellular trafficking of mutated cln <dig>  and they were shown to share a binding partner outside the ncl protein spectrum.
