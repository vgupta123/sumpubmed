BACKGROUND
salmonellosis is a major worldwide zoonosis, and salmonella-infected finishing pigs are considered one of the major sources of human infections in developed countries. baseline studies on salmonellosis prevalence in fattening pigs in europe are based on direct pathogen isolation from mesenteric lymph nodes . this procedure is considered the most reliable for diagnosing salmonellosis in apparently healthy pigs. the presence of simultaneous infections by different salmonella strains in the same animal has never been reported and could have important epidemiological implications.


RESULTS
fourteen finishing pigs belonging to  <dig> farms that showed high salmonellosis prevalence and a variety of circulating salmonella strains, were found infected by salmonella spp, and  <dig> of them were simultaneously infected with strains of  <dig> or  <dig> different serotypes. typhimurium isolates showing resistance to several antimicrobials and carrying mobile integrons were the most frequently identified in the colonized mln. four animals were found infected by salmonella spp. of a single serotype  but showing  <dig> or  <dig> different antimicrobial resistance profiles, without evidence of mobile genetic element exchange in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report clearly demonstrating that pigs naturally infected by salmonella may harbour different salmonella strains simultaneously. this may have implications in the interpretation of results from baseline studies, and also help to better understand human salmonellosis outbreaks and the horizontal transmission of antimicrobial resistance genes.
