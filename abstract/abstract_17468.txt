BACKGROUND
several receptor tyrosine kinases  such as egfr, fgfr, trk, and vegfr are capable of localizing in the cell nucleus in addition to their usual plasma membrane localization. recent reports also demonstrate that nuclear-localized rtks have important cellular functions such as transcriptional activation. on the basis of preliminary bioinformatic analysis, additional rtks, including receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor  <dig>  were predicted to have the potential for nuclear subcellular localization. ror <dig> is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase that modulates neurite growth in the central nervous system. because the nuclear localization capability of the ror <dig> cytoplasmic domain has not been reported, we examined the cellular expression distribution of this region.


RESULTS
the ror <dig> cytoplasmic region was amplified and cloned into reporter constructs with fluorescent tags. following transfection, the nuclear distribution patterns of transiently expressed fusion proteins were observed. serial deletion constructs were then used to map the juxtamembrane domain of ror <dig>  for this nuclear translocation activity. further site-directed mutagenesis suggested that a kxxk- <dig> aa-kxxk sequence at residues 486- <dig> is responsible for the nuclear translocation interaction. subsequent immunofluorescence analysis by cotransfection of ran and ror <dig> implied that the nuclear translocation event of ror <dig> might be mediated through the ran pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
we have predicted several rtks that contain the nuclear localization signals. this is the first report to suggest that the juxtamembrane domain of the ror <dig> cytoplasmic region mediates the translocation event. ran gtpase is also implicated in this event. our study might be beneficial in future research to understand the ror <dig> biological signaling pathway.
