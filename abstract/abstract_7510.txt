BACKGROUND
the phylogenetic position of the elephant shark  is particularly relevant to study the evolution of genes and gene regulation in vertebrates. here we examine the evolution of dlx homeobox gene regulation during vertebrate embryonic development with a particular focus on the forebrain. we first identified the elephant shark sequence orthologous to the ure <dig> cis -regulatory element of the mouse dlx1/dlx <dig> locus . we then conducted a comparative study of the sequence and enhancer activity of cmure <dig> with that of orthologous regulatory sequences from zebrafish and mouse.


RESULTS
the cmure <dig> sequence shows a high percentage of identity with its mouse and zebrafish counterparts but is overall more similar to mouse ure <dig>  than to zebrafish ure <dig> . in transgenic zebrafish and mouse embryos, cmure <dig> displayed enhancer activity in the forebrain that overlapped with that of drure <dig> and mmure <dig>  however, we detected notable differences in the activity of the three sequences in the diencephalon. outside of the forebrain, cmure <dig> shows enhancer activity in areas such as the pharyngeal arches and dorsal root ganglia where its' counterparts are also active.


CONCLUSIONS
our transgenic assays show that part of the ure <dig> enhancer activity is conserved throughout jawed vertebrates but also that new characteristics have evolved in the different groups. our study demonstrates that the elephant shark is a useful outgroup to study the evolution of regulatory mechanisms in vertebrates and to address how changes in the sequence of cis -regulatory elements translate into changes in their regulatory activity.
