BACKGROUND
progesterone binding to the surface of the amphibian oocyte initiates the meiotic divisions. our previous studies with rana pipiens oocytes indicate that progesterone binds to a plasma membrane site within the external loop between the m <dig> and m <dig> helices of the α-subunit of na/k-atpase, triggering a cascade of lipid second messengers and the release of the block at meiotic prophase. we have characterized this site, using a low affinity ouabain binding isoform of the α1-subunit.


RESULTS
preparations of isolated plasma membranes from rana oocytes demonstrate that physiological levels of progesterone  successively activate phosphatidylethanolamine-n-methyltransferase  and sphingomyelin synthase within seconds. inhibition of pe-nmt blocks the progesterone induction of meiosis in intact oocytes, whereas its initial product, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine , can itself initiate meiosis in the presence of the inhibitor. published x-ray crystallographic data on na/k-atpase, computer-generated 3d projections, heptad repeat analysis and hydrophobic cluster analysis of the transmembrane helices predict that hydrophobic residues l, v, v, i, f and y of helix m <dig> of the α1-subunit interact with f, l, g, l, l and f, respectively, of helix m <dig> of pe-nmt.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that progesterone binding to the first external loop of the α1-subunit facilitates specific helix-helix interactions between integral membrane proteins to up-regulate pe-nmt, and, that successive interactions between two or more integral plasma membrane proteins induce the signaling cascades which result in completion of the meiotic divisions.
