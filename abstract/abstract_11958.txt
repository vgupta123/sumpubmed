BACKGROUND
the mountain pine beetle  epidemic has affected lodgepole pine  across an area of more than  <dig> million hectares of pine forests in western canada, and is a threat to the boreal jack pine  forest. defence of pines against mpb and associated fungal pathogens, as well as other pests, involves oleoresin monoterpenes, which are biosynthesized by families of terpene synthases . volatile monoterpenes also serve as host recognition cues for mpb and as precursors for mpb pheromones. the genes responsible for terpene biosynthesis in jack pine and lodgepole pine were previously unknown.


RESULTS
we report the generation and quality assessment of assembled transcriptome resources for lodgepole pine and jack pine using sanger, roche  <dig>  and illumina sequencing technologies. assemblies revealed transcripts for approximately  <dig>  -  <dig>  genes from each species and assembly analyses led to the identification of candidate full-length prenyl transferase, tps, and p <dig> genes of oleoresin biosynthesis. we cloned and functionally characterized, via expression of recombinant proteins in e. coli, nine different jack pine and eight different lodgepole pine mono-tpss. the newly identified lodgepole pine and jack pine mono-tpss include -α-pinene synthases, -α-pinene synthases, -β-pinene synthases, -3-carene synthases, and -β-phellandrene synthases from each of the two species.


CONCLUSIONS
in the absence of genome sequences, transcriptome assemblies are important for defence gene discovery in lodgepole pine and jack pine, as demonstrated here for the terpenoid pathway genes. the product profiles of the functionally annotated mono-tpss described here can account for the major monoterpene metabolites identified in lodgepole pine and jack pine.
