BACKGROUND
one of the many gene families that expanded in early vertebrate evolution is the neuropeptide  receptor family of g-protein coupled receptors. earlier work by our lab suggested that several of the npy receptor genes found in extant vertebrates resulted from two genome duplications before the origin of jawed vertebrates  and one additional genome duplication in the actinopterygian lineage, based on their location on chromosomes sharing several gene families. in this study we have investigated, in five vertebrate genomes,  <dig> gene families with members close to the npy receptor genes in the compact genomes of the teleost fishes tetraodon nigroviridis and takifugu rubripes. these correspond to homo sapiens chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 


RESULTS
chromosome regions with conserved synteny were identified and confirmed by phylogenetic analyses in h. sapiens, m. musculus, d. rerio, t. rubripes and t. nigroviridis.  <dig> gene families, including the npy receptor genes,  showed a tree topology consistent with duplications in early vertebrate evolution and in the actinopterygian lineage, thereby supporting expansion through block duplications. eight gene families had complications that precluded analysis  and another eight families did not support block duplications . rt-pcr carried out with several tissues in t. rubripes revealed that all five npy receptors were expressed in the brain and subtypes y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig> were also expressed in peripheral organs.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the phylogenetic analyses and chromosomal locations of these gene families support duplications of large blocks of genes or even entire chromosomes. thus, these results are consistent with two early vertebrate tetraploidizations forming a paralogon comprising human chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and one teleost tetraploidization. the combination of positional and phylogenetic data further strengthens the identification of orthologs and paralogs in the npy receptor family.
