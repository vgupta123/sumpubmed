BACKGROUND
climate change will lead in the future to an occurrence of heat waves with a higher frequency and duration than observed today, which has the potential to cause severe damage to seedlings of temperate maize genotypes. in this study, we aimed to  assess phenotypic variation for heat tolerance of temperate european flint and dent maize inbred lines,  investigate the transcriptomic response of temperate maize to linearly increasing heat levels and,  identify genes associated with heat tolerance in a set of genotypes with contrasting heat tolerance behaviour.


RESULTS
strong phenotypic differences with respect to heat tolerance were observed between the examined maize inbred lines on a multi-trait level. we identified  <dig> heat responsive genes as well as  <dig> heat tolerance genes.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate that individual inbred lines developed different genetic mechanisms in response to heat stress. we applied a novel statistical approach enabling the integration of multiple genotypes and stress levels in the analysis of abiotic stress expression studies.
