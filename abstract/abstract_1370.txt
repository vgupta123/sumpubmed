BACKGROUND
the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  isolated in horse infections is not well documented, especially in france. the aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of mrsa isolates in horse infections from  <dig> to  <dig> in france and to characterize phenotypically and genotypically this collection.


RESULTS
out of  <dig> s. aureus horse isolates,  <dig>  were confirmed to be mrsa. interestingly, the prevalence of mrsa significantly increased from 2007– <dig> to 2010– <dig> . resistance to methicillin was due to the presence of the meca gene in  <dig> strains  while one strain  possessed the mecc gene. the vast majority of the strains  was resistant to at least three different classes of antibiotics. multi-locus sequence typing  showed that mrsa strains belonged mainly since not all belong to two sequence types : st <dig>  and st <dig> . it is worth to note that all st <dig> mrsa isolates were detected in the period 2010– <dig>  other molecular typing methods were also used, such sccmec analysis, spa typing and rep-pcr . all these four techniques were in good agreement, with spa typing and rep-pcr being more discriminative than mlst and sccmec typing.


CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first epidemiological study in france with extensive characterization of mrsa isolates associated with horse infections in stud farms. it shows that there is a significant increase of mrsa prevalence between  <dig> and  <dig>  which mainly results from the spread of st <dig> clones. it also highlights the importance of horses as a potential reservoir of important antimicrobial resistance genes.
