BACKGROUND

gossypium anomalum  possesses the desirable characteristics of drought tolerance, resistance to diseases and insect pests, and the potential for high quality fibers. however, it is difficult to transfer the genes associated with these desirable traits into cultivated cotton . monosomic alien addition lines  can be used as a bridge to transfer desired genes from wild species into g. hirsutum. in cotton, however, the high number and smaller size of the chromosomes has resulted in difficulties in discriminating chromosomes from wild species in cultivated cotton background, the development of cotton maals has lagged far behind many other crops. to date, no set of g. hirsutum-g. anomalum maals was reported. here the amphiploid  derived from g. hirsutum × g. anomalum was used to generate a set of g. hirsutum-g. anomalum maals through a combination of consecutive backcrossing, genomic in situ hybridization , morphological survey and microsatellite marker identification.


RESULTS
we improved the gish technique used in our previous research by using a mixture of two probes from g. anomalum and g. herbaceum . the results indicate that a ratio of 4: <dig>  is the most suitable for discrimination of chromosomes from g. anomalum and the at-subgenome of g. hirsutum. using this improved gish technique,  <dig> maal individuals were isolated. next,  <dig> g. hirsutum- and g. anomalum-specific codominant markers were obtained and employed for characterization of these maal individuals. finally, eleven out of  <dig> maals were identified. unfortunately, we were unable to isolate chrs. 1ba and 5ba due to their very low incidences in backcrossing generation, as these remained in a condition of multiple additions.


CONCLUSIONS
the characterized lines can be employed as bridges for the transfer of desired genes from g. anomalum into g. hirsutum, as well as for gene assignment, isolation of chromosome-specific probes, development of chromosome-specific “paints” for fluorochrome-labeled dna fragments, physical mapping, and selective isolation and mapping of cdnas/genes for a particular g. anomalum chromosome.
