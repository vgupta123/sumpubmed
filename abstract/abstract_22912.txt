BACKGROUND
the gene encoding the etec f4ab/ac receptors, involved in neonatal diarrhoea in pigs , is located close to the tf locus on sscr <dig>  in order to reveal and characterize possible candidate genes encoding these receptors, a porcine physical map of the tf region is indispensable.


RESULTS
a contig of  <dig> bac clones, covering approximately  <dig>  mb surrounding the tf locus on sscr13q31-q <dig>  was built by chromosome walking. a total of  <dig>  bp from the bac contig were sequenced and compared with database sequences to identify genes, ests and repeat sequences, and to anchor the contig to the syntenic region of the human genome sequence . the contig was further annotated based on this human/porcine comparative map, and was also anchored to the sanger porcine framework map and the integrated map of sscr <dig> by rh mapping.


CONCLUSIONS
the annotated contig, containing  <dig> genes and  <dig> ests, showed a complete conservation of linkage  with the human genome sequence, based on  <dig> anchor points. this underlines the importance of the human/porcine comparative map for the identification of porcine genes associated with genetic defects and economically important traits, and for assembly of the porcine genome sequence.
