BACKGROUND
the ethanol-producing bacterium zymomonas mobilis has attracted considerable scientific and commercial interest due to its exceptional physiological properties. shuttle vectors derived from native plasmids have previously been successfully used for heterologous gene expression in this bacterium for a variety of purposes, most notably for metabolic engineering applications.


RESULTS
a quantitative pcr  approach was used to determine the copy numbers of two endogenous double stranded dna plasmids: pzmo1a  and pzmo <dig>  within the ncimb  <dig> strain of z. mobilis. data indicated pzmo1a and pzmo <dig> were present at ca. 3- <dig> and ca. 1- <dig> copies per cell, respectively. a ca.  <dig>  bp fragment from plasmid pzmo <dig> was used to construct two escherichia coli – z. mobilis shuttle vectors . the intracellular stabilities and copy numbers of pz7c and pz7- <dig> were characterized within the ncimb  <dig>  atcc  <dig> and  cu <dig> rif <dig> strains of z. mobilis. both shuttle vectors could be stably maintained within the atcc  <dig> strain , and the cu <dig> rif <dig> strain , for more than  <dig> generations in the absence of an antibiotic selectable marker. a selectable marker was required for shuttle vector maintenance in the parental ncimb  <dig> strain; most probably due to competition for replication with the endogenous pzmo <dig> plasmid molecules. n-terminal glutathione s-transferase -fusions of four endogenous proteins, namely the acyl-carrier protein ; 2-dehydro-3-deoxyphosphooctonate aldolase ; dna polymerase iii chi subunit ; and the rna chaperone protein hfq; were successfully expressed from pz7c-derived shuttle vectors, and their protein-protein binding interactions were analyzed in z. mobilis atcc  <dig>  using this approach, proteins that co-purified with acpp and kdsa were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that a shuttle vector-based protein affinity ‘pull-down’ approach can be used to probe protein interaction networks in z. mobilis cells. our results demonstrate that protein expression plasmids derived from pzmo <dig> have significant potential for use in future biological or biotechnological applications within z. mobilis.
