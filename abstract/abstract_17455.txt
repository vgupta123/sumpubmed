BACKGROUND
microsomal cyp2e <dig> metabolizes about  <dig> hydrophobic exogens, many of which are environmental pollutants. while metabolising xenobiotics cyp2e <dig> on one hand facilitates in their excretion and on the other hand activates them into the cytotoxins, which may damage the cell. thus the cyp2e <dig> activity level significantly affects the processes in cell. posttranslational stabilization of cyp2e <dig> seems to be the main mechanism of its regulation in living cell. it is known that degradation of cyp2el takes part in cytoplasmic proteasome system. the efficiency of such degradation depends on the presence of molecular chaperones  as was shown from in vitro experiments. but the processes that involve hsp <dig> in the degradation of cyp2e <dig> and the mechanisms of transfer of microsomal cyp2e <dig> to the proteasome system remain unknown. this paper investigates hsp90-dependent processes in mechanisms of cyp2el degradation and the possible role of ethanol in them.


RESULTS
with the help of computational methods we have shown that cyp2e <dig> can interact with hsp <dig> resulting in dissociation of cyp2e <dig> from membrane and formation of the cyp2e1-hsp <dig> complex for its further transfer to the proteasome for degradation. the twofold increase of both cyp2e <dig> and hsp <dig> in the mouse liver under the constant alcohol administration was shown using wb methods. also, as was shown in silico, ethanol molecule, while binding to the cyp2e <dig> active site, prevents its interaction with hsp <dig>  thus resulting in accumulation of cyp2e <dig> in cell.


CONCLUSIONS
cytoplasmic hsp <dig> and membrane-bound cyp2e <dig> may directly interact with each other as partner proteins, leading to the dissociation of the cyp2e <dig> from the membrane. this makes it possible to transfer microsomal cyp2e <dig> in complex with hsp <dig> to the proteasome for proteolysis. the ethanol molecule inhibits the interaction of hsp <dig> with cyp2e <dig> leading to the suppression of its proteasome degradation, thus increasing level of this protein in the cell. other substrates of cyp2e <dig> should increase level of this protein in the same way. this may be one of the mechanisms of substrate-dependent regulation of the cyp2e <dig> expression in the cell.
