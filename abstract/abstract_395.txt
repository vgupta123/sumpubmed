BACKGROUND
teneurins are transmembrane proteins that assist morphogenetic processes in many organisms. ten- <dig> is the c. elegans teneurin homolog with two transcripts, ten-1a and ten-1b, that respectively encode a long  and short  form of the protein. we previously isolated a c. elegans mutant where one pharyngeal neuron was frequently misplaced, and now show that it corresponds to a novel allele of ten- <dig> 


RESULTS
the novel ten- <dig> allele is a hypomorph since its post-embryonic phenotype is weaker than the null alleles ten- <dig> and ten- <dig>  ten- <dig> mutants have defects in all pharyngeal neurons that we examined, and in vivo reporters show that only the long form of the ten- <dig> gene is expressed in the pharynx, specifically in six marginal cells and the m <dig> neurons. defects in the pharyngeal m <dig> neurons were enhanced when the ten- <dig> mutation was combined with mutations in the following genes: mig- <dig>  unc- <dig>  unc- <dig>  unc- <dig> and unc- <dig>  none of the body neurons examined show any defects in the ten- <dig> mutant, but genetic interaction studies reveal that ten- <dig> is synthetic lethal with sax- <dig>  unc- <dig> and unc- <dig>  and examination of the hypodermal cells in embryos of the ten- <dig> mutant point to a role of ten- <dig> during hypodermal cell morphogenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
our results are consistent with ten- <dig> normally providing a function complementary to the cytoskeletal remodeling processes that occur in migrating cells or cells undergoing morphogenesis. it is possible that ten- <dig> influences the composition/distribution of extracellular matrix.
