BACKGROUND
many problems in computational biology require alignment-free sequence comparisons. one of the common tasks involving sequence comparison is sequence clustering. here we apply methods of alignment-free comparison  to the challenge of sequence clustering.


RESULTS
we study several centroid based algorithms for clustering sequences based on word counts. study of their performance shows that using k-means algorithm with or without the data whitening is efficient from the computational point of view. a higher clustering accuracy can be achieved using the soft expectation maximization method, whereby each sequence is attributed to each cluster with a specific probability. we implement an open source tool for alignment-free clustering. it is publicly available from github:
https://github.com/luscinius/afcluster.


CONCLUSIONS
we show the utility of alignment-free sequence clustering for high throughput sequencing analysis despite its limitations. in particular, it allows one to perform assembly with reduced resources and a minimal loss of quality. the major factor affecting performance of alignment-free read clustering is the length of the read.
