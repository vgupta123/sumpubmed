BACKGROUND
the protein-protein interaction  is one of the most important features to understand biological processes. for a ppi, the physical domain-domain interaction  plays the key role for biology functions. in the post-genomic era, to rapidly identify homologous ppis for analyzing the contact residue pairs of their interfaces within ddis on a genomic scale is essential to determine ppi networks and the ppi interface evolution across multiple species.


RESULTS
in this study, we proposed "pair position specific scoring matrix " to identify homologous ppis. the pairpssm can successfully distinguish the true protein complexes from unreasonable protein pairs with about 90% accuracy. for the test set including  <dig>  representative heterodimers and  <dig> , <dig> non-interacting protein pairs, the mean average precision and mean false positive rate of pairpssm were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. moreover, we applied pairpssm to identify ~ <dig>  homologous ppis with their interacting domains and residues in seven common organisms .


CONCLUSIONS
our pairpssm is able to provide statistical significance of residue pairs using evolutionary profiles and a scoring system for inferring homologous ppis. according to our best knowledge, the pairpssm is the first method for searching homologous ppis across multiple species using pair position specific scoring matrix and a 3d dimer as the template to map interacting domain pairs of these ppis. we believe that pairpssm is able to provide valuable insights for the ppi evolution and networks across multiple species.
