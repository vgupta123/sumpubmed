BACKGROUND
acute postsurgical pain is of great interest due to potential risk of becoming chronic if not treated properly, worsening patient’s recovery and quality of life. twenty-eight dogs with ruptured cruciate ligaments were divided into three groups that received intramuscular injections of 4 mg/kg of tramadol ,  <dig>  mg/kg of methadone , or  <dig>  mg/kg of methadone . physiological parameters  were evaluated at specified times: baseline ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  hours after premedication. pain scores were described by visual analogue scale , modified glasgow composite, and colorado university acute pain scales. blood samples for measurement of interleukin - <dig> were collected at tbl, t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig>  this was a prospective, randomised investigation to evaluate the efficacy of tramadol and methadone as premedications in dogs undergoing osteotomies.


RESULTS
there were no statistically significant differences between groups with respect to age, weight, gender, surgery time, and time to extubation. heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure values were maintained within acceptable ranges, and a reduction was observed at t <dig> in met <dig>  and met <dig>  compared with tbl. increases in vas scores were observed in tra at t <dig> compared with tbl, t <dig>  and t <dig> and between t <dig> and t <dig> . in met <dig> , there was significant increase in vas score at t <dig> compared with t <dig> . tra and met <dig>  showed significantly higher mean ± sd vas scores  than met <dig>   at t <dig> . tra showed greater demand of rescue analgesia  . there were no statistically significant differences in sedation scores, colorado scale scores, or interleukin levels between groups and time points.


CONCLUSIONS
methadone given as premedication in doses of  <dig>  mg/kg was better at controlling pain compared with lower doses and tramadol. however, dosage increases, administered as rescue analgesia, promoted adequate pain control even in tramadol group. influence of these analgesics on il- <dig> release could not be demonstrated, but significant levels were not found.
