BACKGROUND
entamoeba histolytica is a professional phagocytic cell where the vacuolar atpase plays a key role. this enzyme is a multisubunit complex that regulates ph in many subcellular compartments, even in those that are not measurably acidic. it participates in a wide variety of cellular processes such as endocytosis, intracellular transport and membrane fusion. the presence of a vacuolar type h+-atpase in e. histolytica trophozoites has been inferred previously from inhibition assays of its activity, the isolation of the ehvma <dig> and ehvma <dig> genes, and by proteomic analysis of purified phagosomes.


RESULTS
we report the isolation and characterization of the ehvma <dig> gene, which encodes for the subunit b of the vacuolar atpase. this polypeptide is a  <dig>  kda highly conserved protein with  <dig> to 80% identity to orthologous proteins from other species. particularly, in silico studies showed that ehv-atpase subunit b displays 78% identity and 90% similarity to its dictyostelium ortholog. a  <dig> bp dna fragment of the ehvma <dig> gene was expressed in bacteria and recombinant polypeptide was used to raise mouse polyclonal antibodies. ehv-atpase subunit b antibodies detected a  <dig> kda band in whole cell extracts and in an enriched fraction of dna-containing organelles named ehkos. the v-atpase subunit b was located by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy in many vesicles, in phagosomes, plasma membrane and in ehkos. we also identified the genes encoding for the majority of the v-atpase subunits in the e. histolytica genome, and proposed a putative model for this proton pump.


CONCLUSIONS
we have isolated the ehvma <dig> gene which encodes for the v-atpase subunit b from the e. histolytica clone a. this gene has a  <dig> bp intron and encodes for a highly conserved polypeptide. specific antibodies localized ehv-atpase subunit b in many vesicles, phagosomes, plasma membrane and in ehkos. most of the orthologous genes encoding for the ehv-atpase subunits were found in the e. histolytica genome, indicating the conserved nature of v-atpase in this parasite.
