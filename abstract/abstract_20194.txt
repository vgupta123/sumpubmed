BACKGROUND
to balance the demand for uptake of essential elements with their potential toxicity living cells have complex regulatory mechanisms. here, we describe a genome-wide screen to identify genes that impact the elemental composition  of yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. using inductively coupled plasma â€“ mass spectrometry  we quantify ca, cd, co, cu, fe, k, mg, mn, mo, na, ni, p, s and zn in  <dig> mutant strains, including  <dig> haploid and  <dig> diploid deletion strains, and  <dig> over expression strains.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> strains with an altered ionome, including  <dig> haploid and  <dig> diploid deletion strains, and  <dig> over expression strains. disruption of protein metabolism or trafficking has the highest likelihood of causing large ionomic changes, with gene dosage also being important. gene over expression produced more extreme ionomic changes, but over expression and loss of function phenotypes are generally not related. ionomic clustering revealed the existence of only a small number of possible ionomic profiles suggesting fitness tradeoffs that constrain the ionome. clustering also identified important roles for the mitochondria, vacuole and escrt pathway in regulation of the ionome. network analysis identified hub genes such as pmr <dig> in mn homeostasis, novel members of ionomic networks such as smf <dig> in vacuolar retrieval of mn, and cross-talk between the mitochondria and the vacuole. all yeast ionomic data can be searched and downloaded at http://www.ionomicshub.org.


CONCLUSIONS
here, we demonstrate the power of high-throughput icp-ms analysis to functionally dissect the ionome on a genome-wide scale. the information this reveals has the potential to benefit both human health and agriculture.
