BACKGROUND
previous whole-genome shotgun bisulfite sequencing experiments showed that dna cytosine methylation in the honey bee  is almost exclusively at cg dinucleotides in exons. however, the most commonly used method, bisulfite sequencing, cannot distinguish 5-methylcytosine from 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, an oxidized form of 5-methylcytosine that is catalyzed by the tet family of dioxygenases. furthermore, some analysis software programs under-represent non-cg dna methylation and hydryoxymethylation for a variety of reasons. therefore, we used an unbiased analysis of bisulfite sequencing data combined with molecular and bioinformatics approaches to distinguish 5-methylcytosine from 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. by doing this, we have performed the first whole genome analyses of dna modifications at non-cg sites in honey bees and correlated the effects of these dna modifications on gene expression and alternative mrna splicing.


RESULTS
we confirmed, using unbiased analyses of whole-genome shotgun bisulfite sequencing  data, with both new data and published data, the previous finding that cg dna methylation is enriched in exons in honey bees. however, we also found evidence that cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation at non-cg sites is enriched in introns. using antibodies against 5-hydroxmethylcytosine, we confirmed that dna hydroxymethylation at non-cg sites is enriched in introns. additionally, using a new technique, pvu-seq , we further confirmed that hydroxymethylation is enriched in introns at non-cg sites.


CONCLUSIONS
cytosine hydroxymethylation at non-cg sites might have more functional significance than previously appreciated, and in honey bees these modifications might be related to the regulation of alternative mrna splicing by defining the locations of the introns.
