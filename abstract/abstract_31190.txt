BACKGROUND
genes specifically expressed in the oocyte play key roles in oogenesis, ovarian folliculogenesis, fertilization and/or early embryonic development. in an attempt to identify novel oocyte-specific genes in the mouse, we have used an in silico subtraction methodology, and we have focused our attention on genes that are organized in genomic clusters.


RESULTS
in the present work, five clusters have been studied: a cluster of thirteen genes characterized by an f-box domain localized on chromosome  <dig>  a cluster of six genes related to t-cell leukaemia/lymphoma protein  <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  a cluster composed of a sperm-associated glutamate -rich  protein expressed in the oocyte in the vicinity of four unknown genes specifically expressed in the testis on chromosome  <dig>  a cluster composed of the oocyte secreted protein- <dig>  gene and two oosp-related genes on chromosome  <dig>  all three being characterized by a partial n-terminal zona pellucida-like domain, and another small cluster of two genes on chromosome  <dig> as well, composed of a twik-related spinal cord k+ channel encoding-gene, and an unknown gene predicted in silico to be testis-specific. the specificity of expression was confirmed by rt-pcr and in situ hybridization for eight and five of them, respectively. finally, we showed by comparing all of the isolated and clustered oocyte-specific genes identified so far in the mouse genome, that the oocyte-specific clusters are significantly closer to telomeres than isolated oocyte-specific genes are.


CONCLUSIONS
we have studied five clusters of genes specifically expressed in female, some of them being also expressed in male germ-cells. moreover, contrarily to non-clustered oocyte-specific genes, those that are organized in clusters tend to map near chromosome ends, suggesting that this specific near-telomere position of oocyte-clusters in rodents could constitute an evolutionary advantage. understanding the biological benefits of such an organization as well as the mechanisms leading to a specific oocyte expression in these clusters now requires further investigation.
