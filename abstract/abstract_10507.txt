BACKGROUND
proteins that are similar in sequence or structure may perform different functions in nature. in such cases, function cannot be inferred from sequence or structural similarity.


RESULTS
we analyzed experimental structures belonging to the structural classification of proteins  database and showed that about half of them belong to multi-functional fold families for which protein similarity alone is not adequate to assign function. we also analyzed predicted structures from the livebench and the pdb-cafasp experiments and showed that accurate homology-based functional assignments cannot be achieved approximately one third of the time, when the protein is a member of a multi-functional fold family. we then conducted extended performance evaluation and comparisons on both experimental and predicted structures using our functional signatures from structural alignments  algorithm that we previously developed to handle the problem of classifying proteins belonging to multi-functional fold families.


CONCLUSIONS
the results indicate that the fssa algorithm has better accuracy when compared to homology-based approaches for functional classification of both experimental and predicted protein structures, in part due to its use of local, as opposed to global, information for classifying function. the fssa algorithm has also been implemented as a webserver and is available at .
