BACKGROUND
the genetic diversity of anaplasma platys  strains is currently poorly defined. the present study was designed to characterize a. patys strains in dogs from palermo, sicily, italy, using a combination of pcr and sequence analysis of the 16s rdna, heat shock operon groesl and citrate synthase  genes.


RESULTS
blood was collected from  <dig> dogs  during 2003â€“ <dig> in the province of palermo, sicily, italy. the prevalence of a. platys in dogs in sicily, as demonstrated by pcr and sequence analysis of the 16s rdna, groesl and glta genes, was 4%. none of the samples were positive for a. marginale, a. centrale, a. ovis and a. phagocytophilum dna. three different glta genotypes of a. platys were identified in dogs from sicily. two of the glta sequences of sicilian a. platys strains were different from sequences reported previously. however, one of the glta, 16s rdna and groesl sequences were identical to the sequence of a. platys strains from other regions of the world characterized previously.


CONCLUSIONS
at least three different strains of a. platys were identified in dogs from sicily by pcr and sequence analyses of the 16s rdna, groesl and glta genes. the results reported herein suggested that genetic diversity of a. platys strains may be similar to a. ovis, but lower than the diversity reported for a. marginale and a. phagocytophilum. this lower genetic diversity may have resulted from restricted movement of infected hosts compared to a. marginale-infected cattle and/or the limited host range of a. ovis and a. platys as compared with a. phagocytophilum. these results expand our knowledge about a. platys and encourage further research for analysis of the genetic variation of a. platys strains worldwide.
