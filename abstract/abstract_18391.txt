BACKGROUND
genetic linkage maps are necessary for mapping of mendelian traits and quantitative trait loci . to identify the actual genes, which control these traits, a map based on gene-associated single nucleotide polymorphism  markers is highly valuable. in this study, the snps were genotyped in a large family material comprising more than  <dig>  piglets derived from  <dig> duroc boars crossed with  <dig> danish landrace/danish large white sows. the snps were identified in sequence alignments of  <dig>  different amplicons obtained from the  <dig> boars and containing coding regions of genes derived from expressed sequence tags  and genomic shotgun sequences.


RESULTS
linkage maps of all  <dig> porcine autosomes were constructed based on  <dig> gene-associated and six porcine est-based snps. the total length of the averaged-sex whole porcine autosome was estimated to  <dig> . <dig> cm resulting in an average snp spacing of  <dig>  cm. the female and male maps were estimated to  <dig> . <dig> and  <dig> . <dig> cm, respectively. the gene order was validated through comparisons to the cytogenetic and/or physical location of  <dig> genes, linkage to evenly spaced microsatellite markers as well as previously reported conserved synteny. a total of  <dig> previously unmapped genes and ests were mapped to the porcine autosome while ten genes were mapped to unexpected locations.


CONCLUSIONS
the linkage map presented here shows high accuracy in gene order. the pedigree family network as well as the large amount of meiotic events provide good reliability and make this map suitable for qtl and association studies. in addition, the linkage to the rh-map of microsatellites makes it suitable for comparison to other qtl studies.
