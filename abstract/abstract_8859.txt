BACKGROUND
the use of ultrasound in veterinary medicine is widespread as a diagnostic supplement in the clinical routine of small animals, but there are few reports in wild animals. the objective of this study was to describe the anatomy, topography and abdominal sonographic features of coatis.


RESULTS
the urinary bladder wall measured  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm. the symmetrical kidneys were in the left and right cranial quadrant of the abdomen and the cortical, medullary and renal pelvis regions were recognized and in all sections. the medullary rim sign was visualized in the left kidney of two coatis. the liver had homogeneous texture and was in the cranial abdomen under the rib cage. the gallbladder, rounded and filled with anechoic content was visualized in all coatis, to the right of the midline. the spleen was identified in the left cranial abdomen following the greater curvature of the stomach. the parenchyma was homogeneous and hyperechogenic compared to the liver and kidney cortex. the stomach was in the cranial abdomen, limited cranially by the liver and caudo-laterally by the spleen. the left adrenal glands of five coatis were seen in the cranial pole of the left kidney showing hypoechogenic parenchyma without distinction of cortex and medulla. the pancreas was visualized in only two coatis. the left ovary  was visualized on a single coati in the caudal pole of the kidney. the uterus, right adrenal, right ovary and intestines were not visualized.


CONCLUSIONS
ultrasound examination of the abdomen of coatis may be accomplished by following the recommendations for dogs and cats. it is possible to evaluate the anatomical and topographical relationships of the abdominal organs together with the knowledge of the peculiarities of parenchymal echogenicity and echotexture of the viscera.
