BACKGROUND
livestock trypanosomiasis, transmitted mainly by tsetse flies of the genus glossina is a major constraint to livestock health and productivity in the sub-saharan africa. knowledge of the prevalence and intensity of trypanosomiasis is important in understanding the epidemiology of the disease. the objectives of this study were to  assess the prevalence and intensity of trypanosome infections in cattle, and  to investigate the reasons for the heterogeneity of the disease in the tsetse infested districts of amuru and nwoya, northern uganda.

methods
a cross-sectional study was conducted from september,  <dig> to january,  <dig>  blood samples were collected from  <dig> cattle following jugular vein puncture, and screened for trypanosomes by hct and its-pcr. a pearson chi-squared test and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between location, age, sex, and prevalence of trypanosome infections.


RESULTS
out of the  <dig> blood samples examined,  <dig>  and  <dig>  tested positive for trypanosomiasis by hct and its-pcr, respectively. trypanosoma vivax infection accounted for  <dig> % of infections detected by its-pcr, t. congolense , t. brucei s.l  and mixed  infections . the risk of trypanosome infection was significantly associated with cattle age . the highest proportions of infected animals were adult males  and the least infected were the less than one year old calves . in addition, the risk of trypanosome infection was significantly associated with sex , and males had a significantly higher prevalence of infections  than females .


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the prevalence and intensity of trypanosome infections are highly heterogeneous being associated with cattle age, location and sex.
