BACKGROUND
insulin stimulates glucose uptake by adipocytes through increasing translocation of the glucose transporter glut <dig> from an intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane. fusion of glut4-containing vesicles at the cell surface is thought to involve phospholipase d activity, generating the signalling lipid phosphatidic acid, although the mechanism of action is not yet clear.


RESULTS
here we report the identification of a putative phosphatidic acid-binding motif in a glut <dig> intracellular loop. mutation of this motif causes a decrease in the insulin-induced exposure of glut <dig> at the cell surface of 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes via an effect on vesicle fusion.


CONCLUSIONS
the potential phosphatidic acid-binding motif identified in this study is unique to glut <dig> among the sugar transporters, therefore this motif may provide a unique mechanism for regulating insulin-induced translocation by phospholipase d signalling.
