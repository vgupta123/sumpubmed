BACKGROUND
plasmodium vivax is the most widespread human malaria parasite. however, genetic information about its pathogenesis is limited at present, due to the lack of a reproducible in vitro cultivation method. sequencing of the plasmodium vivax genome suggested the presence of a homolog of deoxyhypusine synthase  from p. falciparum, the key regulatory enzyme in the first committed step of hypusine biosynthesis. dhs is involved in cell proliferation, and thus a valuable drug target for the human malaria parasite p. falciparum. a comparison of the enzymatic properties of the dhs enzymes between the benign and severe plasmodium species should contribute to our understanding of the differences in pathogenicity and phylogeny of both malaria parasites.


RESULTS
we describe the cloning of a  <dig> bp putative deoxyhypusine synthase gene  sequence from genomic dna of p. vivax pest strain salvador i  after touchdown pcr. the corresponding protein was expressed and functionally characterized as deoxyhypusine synthase by determination of its specific activity and cross-reactivity to human dhs on a western blot.

the putative dhs protein from p. vivax displays a fasta score of  <dig> relative to dhs from rodent malaria parasite, p. yoelii, and  <dig> relative to that from the human parasite, p. falciparum strain 3d <dig>  the orf encoding  <dig> amino acids was expressed under control of iptg-inducible t <dig> promoter, and expressed as a protein of approximately  <dig> kda  in e. coli bl <dig> de <dig> cells. the n-terminal histidine-tagged protein was purified by nickel-chelate affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions. dhs with a theoretical pi of  <dig>  was present in both eluate fractions. the specific enzymatic activity of dhs was determined as  <dig> u/mg protein. the inhibitor, n-guanyl- <dig>  7-diaminoheptane , suppressed specific activity by 36-fold. western blot analysis performed with a polyclonal anti-human dhs antibody revealed cross-reactivity to dhs from p. vivax, despite an amino acid identity of 44% between the proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
we identify a novel dhs protein in the more benign malaria parasite,p. vivax, on the basis of specific enzymatic activity, cross-reactivity with a polyclonal antibody against human dhs, and amino acid identity with dhs homologs from the rodent malaria parasite, p. yoelii, and human p. falciparum strains.
