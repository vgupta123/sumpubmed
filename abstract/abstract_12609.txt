BACKGROUND
the thermophilic filamentous fungus myceliophthora thermophila has many suitable characteristics for industrial biotechnology and could be a promising new chassis system for synthetic biology, particularly the atcc  <dig> strain, whose genome was sequenced in  <dig>  however, metabolic engineering of this strain using genetic approaches has not been reported owing to a lack of genetic tools for this organism.


RESULTS
in the present study, we developed a high efficiency agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation system for m. thermophila, including an approach for targeted gene deletion using green fluorescence protein  as a marker for selection. up to  <dig> transformants per  <dig> conidia were obtained in one transformation plate. moreover, a ku <dig> deletion mutant was constructed in the atcc  <dig> background using the tools developed in present study and subsequently characterized. the ku <dig> deletion construct was designed using resistance to phosphinothricin as the selection marker. additionally, a gfp-encoding cassette was incorporated that allowed for the selection of site-specific  or ectopic  integration of the ku <dig> construct. transformants with ectopically integrated ku <dig> deletion constructs were therefore identified using the fluorescent signal of gfp. pcr and southern blotting analyses of non-fluorescent putative ku <dig> deletion transformants revealed all  <dig> tested transformants to be correct deletions. the deletion frequency in a pool of  <dig> transformants analyzed was 58 %. moreover, the homologous rate improved about  <dig> folds under ku <dig> mutant using the pyrg as a test gene to disrupt in m. thermophila.


CONCLUSIONS
we successfully developed an efficient transformation and target gene disruption approach for m. thermophila atcc  <dig> mediated by a. tumefaciens. the tools and the ku <dig> deletion strain developed here should advance the development of m. thermophila as an industrial host through metabolic engineering and accelerate the elucidation of the mechanism of rapid cellulose degradation in this thermophilic fungus.
