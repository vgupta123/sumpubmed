BACKGROUND
emergence of multi-drug resistant  serotype 19a streptococcus pneumoniae  is well-documented but causal factors remain unclear. canadian spn isolates  were serotyped and in vitro susceptibility tested. a subset of mdr 19a were multi-locus sequence typed  and representative isolates' whole genomes sequenced.


RESULTS
mdr 19a increased in the post-pcv <dig> era while 19f, 6b, and 23f concurrently declined. mlst of mdr 19a  revealed that sequence type   <dig> predominated. st <dig> was unique amongst mdr 19a in that its minimum inhibitory concentration  values for penicillin, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, and erythromycin were higher than for other st present amongst post-pcv <dig> mdr 19a. dna sequencing revealed that alleles at key drug resistance loci pbp2a, pbp2x, pbp2b, ermb, mefa/e, and tetm were conserved between pre-pcv <dig> st  <dig> 19f and post-pcv <dig> st  <dig> 19a most likely due to a capsule switch recombination event. a genome wide comparison of mdr 19a st <dig> with mdr 19f st <dig> identified  <dig> unique snps in 19a,  <dig> of which were present in antimicrobial resistance genes and  <dig> in virulence factors.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest a complex genetic picture where high-level drug resistance, vaccine selection pressure, and spn mutational events have created a "perfect storm" for the emergence of mdr 19a.
