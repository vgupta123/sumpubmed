BACKGROUND
low density arrays  have recently been introduced as a novel approach to gene expression profiling. based on real time quantitative rt-pcr , these arrays enable a more focused and sensitive approach to the study of gene expression than gene chips, while offering higher throughput than more established approaches to qrt-pcr. we have now evaluated ldas as a means of determining the expression of multiple genes simultaneously in human tissues and cells.


RESULTS
comparisons between ldas reveal low variability, with correlation coefficients close to  <dig>  by performing 2-fold and 10-fold serial dilutions of cdna samples in the ldas we determined a clear linear relationship between the gene expression data points over  <dig> orders of magnitude. we also showed that it is possible to use ldas to accurately and quantitatively detect 2-fold changes in target copy number as well as measuring genes that are expressed with low and high copy numbers in the range of  <dig> ×  <dig> –  <dig> ×  <dig> copies. furthermore, the data generated by the lda from a cell based pharmacological study were comparable to data generated by conventional qrt-pcr.


CONCLUSIONS
ldas represent a valuable new approach for sensitive and quantitative gene expression profiling.
