BACKGROUND
primary diseases of the omasum are uncommon in goats, although the omasum may be involved in various gastrointestinal disorders. examination of the caprine omasum via ultrasonography requires a good understanding of the normal appearance of the organ. however, in contrast to cattle, there is a lack of reference information on this topic in goats. thus, the goal of the present study was to describe the results of ultrasonography of the omasum in  <dig> healthy saanen goats.


RESULTS
ultrasonography was carried out in standing, non-sedated goats using a  <dig>  mhz linear transducer. the location and size of the omasum, thickness of the omasal wall and visualisation of the abomasal laminae, contents and contractions were assessed. the omasum was visible from the 9th intercostal space  in all the goats, and from the 8th and 10th icss in  <dig> and  <dig> goats, respectively. the omasum was seen medial to the liver, but only the omasal wall closest to the transducer was visible. the dorsal omasal limit formed a dorsally convex curve running from cranioventral to caudodorsal and was furthest from the dorsal midline in the 6th ics. the ventral omasal limit formed a ventrally convex curve. the size of the omasum was largest  in the 9th ics and decreased cranially and caudally from this position. active omasal motility was recorded in  <dig> goats with  <dig>  to  <dig>  contractions per minute.


CONCLUSIONS
the findings of this study provide reference ranges for the interpretation of the location and size of the omasum in goats with suspected omasal abnormalities. ultrasonography is an ideal diagnostic tool for evaluation of the omasum, which is not accessible to conventional examination techniques, such as inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation.
