BACKGROUND
bacterial leaf blight causes significant yield losses in rice crops throughout asia and africa. although both the asian and african strains of the pathogen, xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae , induce similar symptoms, they are nevertheless genetically different, with the african strains being more closely related to the asian x. oryzae pv. oryzicola .


RESULTS
changes in gene expression of the african xoo strain mai <dig> in the susceptible rice cultivar nipponbare were profiled, using an ssh xoo dna microarray. microarray hybridization was performed comparing bacteria recovered from plant tissues at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days after inoculation  with bacteria grown in vitro. a total of  <dig> bacterial genes were found to be differentially expressed, with  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated. expression profiling indicated that less than 20% of the  <dig> bacterial transcripts were induced in the first  <dig> h after inoculation, whereas 63% were differentially expressed at  <dig> dai. the  <dig> differentially expressed genes were one-end sequenced.  <dig> sequences were obtained from which  <dig> non-redundant sequences were identified. differentially expressed genes were related to metabolism, secretion and transport, pathogen adherence to plant tissues, plant cell-wall degradation, is elements, and virulence. in addition, various other genes encoding proteins with unknown function or showing no similarity to other proteins were also induced. the xoo mai <dig> non-redundant set of sequences was compared against several x. oryzae genomes, revealing a specific group of genes that was present only in mai <dig>  numerous is elements were also found to be differentially expressed. quantitative real-time pcr confirmed 86% of the identified profile on a set of  <dig> genes selected according to the microarray analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report to compare the expression of xoo genes in planta across different time points during infection. this work shows that as-yet-unidentified and potentially new virulence factors are appearing in an emerging african pathogen. it also confirms that african xoo strains do differ from their asian counterparts, even at the transcriptional level.
