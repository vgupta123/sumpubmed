BACKGROUND
zhx <dig> to  <dig>  form a set of paralogous genes encoding multi-domain proteins. zhx proteins consist of two zinc fingers followed by five homeodomains. zhxs have biological roles in cell cycle control by acting as co-repressors of the transcriptional regulator nuclear factor y. as part of a structural genomics project we have expressed single and multi-domain fragments of the different human zhx genes for use in structure determination.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> single and multiple domain zhx1- <dig> constructs selected from bioinformatics protocols were screened for soluble expression in e. coli using high throughput methodologies. two homeodomains were crystallized leading to structures for zhx <dig> hd <dig> and zhx <dig> hd <dig>  zhx <dig> hd <dig>  although closest matched to homeodomains from 'homez' and 'engrailed', showed structural differences, notably an additional c-terminal helix  which wrapped over helix i thereby making extensive contacts. although zhx <dig> hd2- <dig> was successfully expressed and purified, proteolysis occurred during crystallization yielding crystals of just hd <dig>  the structure of zhx <dig> hd <dig> showed an unusual open conformation with helix i undergoing 'domain-swapping' to form a homodimer.


CONCLUSIONS
although multiple-domain constructs of zhx <dig> selected by bioinformatics studies could be expressed solubly, only single homeodomains yielded crystals. the crystal structure of zhx <dig> hd <dig> showed additional hydrophobic interactions relative to many known homeodomains via extensive contacts formed by the novel c-terminal helix v with, in particular, helix i. additionally, the replacement of some charged covariant residues , by apolar residues further increases hydrophobic contacts within zhx <dig> hd <dig>  and potentially stability, relative to engrailed homeodomain. zhx <dig> hd <dig> helix v points away from the normally observed dna major groove binding site on homeodomains and thus would not obstruct the putative binding of nucleic acid. in contrast, for zhx <dig> hd <dig> the observed altered conformation involving rearrangement of helix i, relative to the canonical homeodomain fold, disrupts the normal dna binding site, although protein-protein binding is possible as observed in homodimer formation.
