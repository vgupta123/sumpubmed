BACKGROUND
desert hedgehog  belongs to the hedgehog gene family that act as secreted intercellular signal transducers. dhh is an essential morphogen for normal testicular development and function in both mice and humans but is not present in the avian lineage. like other hedgehog proteins, dhh signals through the patched  receptors  <dig> and  <dig>  here we examine the expression and protein distribution of dhh, ptch <dig> and ptch <dig> in the developing testes of a marsupial mammal  to determine whether dhh signalling is a conserved factor in gonadal development in all therian mammals.


RESULTS
dhh, ptch <dig> and ptch <dig> were present in the marsupial genome and highly conserved with their eutherian orthologues. phylogenetic analyses indicate that dhh has recently evolved and is a mammal-specific hedgehog orthologue. the marsupial ptch <dig> receptor had an additional exon  not annotated in eutherian ptch <dig> proteins. interestingly we found evidence of this exon in humans and show that its translation would result in a truncated protein with functions similar to ptch <dig>  we also show that dhh expression was not restricted to the testes during gonadal development , but was also expressed in the developing ovary. expression of dhh, ptch <dig> and ptch <dig> in the adult tammar testis and ovary was consistent with findings in the adult mouse.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that there is a highly conserved role for dhh signalling in the differentiation and function of the mammalian testis and that dhh may be necessary for marsupial ovarian development. the receptors ptch <dig> and ptch <dig> are highly conserved mediators of hedgehog signalling in both the developing and adult marsupial gonads. together these findings indicate dhh is an essential therian mammal-specific morphogen in gonadal development and gametogenesis.
