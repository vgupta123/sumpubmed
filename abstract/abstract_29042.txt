BACKGROUND
plant profilin genes encode core cell-wall structural proteins and are evidenced for their up-regulation under cotton domestication. notwithstanding striking discoveries in the genetics of cell-wall organization in plants, little is explicit about the manner in which profilin-mediated molecular interplay and corresponding networks are altered, especially during cellular signalling of apical meristem determinacy and flower development.


RESULTS
here we show that the ectopic expression of ghprf <dig> gene in tobacco resulted in the hyperactivation of apical meristem and early flowering phenotype with increased flower number in comparison to the control plants. spatial expression alteration in clv <dig>  a key meristem-determinacy gene, is induced by the ghprf <dig> overexpression in a wus-dependent manner and mediates cell signalling to promote flowering. but no such expression alterations are recorded in the ghprf1-rnai lines. the ghprf <dig> transduces key positive flowering regulator ap <dig> gene via coordinated expression of ft <dig>  soc <dig>  flc <dig> and ft <dig> genes involved in the apical-to-floral meristem signalling cascade which is consistent with our in silico profilin interaction data. remarkably, these positive and negative flowering regulators are spatially controlled by the actin-related protein  genes, specifically arp <dig> and arp <dig> in proximate association with profilins. this study provides a novel and systematic link between ghprf <dig> gene expression and the flower primordium initiation via up-regulation of the arp genes, and an insight into the functional characterization of ghprf <dig> gene acting upstream to the flowering mechanism. also, the transgenic plants expressing ghprf <dig> gene show an increase in the plant height, internode length, leaf size and plant vigor.


CONCLUSIONS
overexpression of ghprf <dig> gene induced early and increased flowering in tobacco with enhanced plant vigor. during apical meristem determinacy and flower development, the ghprf <dig> gene directly influences key flowering regulators through arp-genes, indicating for its role upstream in the apical-to-floral meristem signalling cascade.
