BACKGROUND
postnatal growth in mouse is rapid, with total skeletal muscle mass increasing several-fold in the first few weeks. muscle growth can be achieved by either an increase in muscle fibre number or an increase in the size of individual myofibres, or a combination of both. where myofibre hypertrophy during growth requires the addition of new myonuclei, these are supplied by muscle satellite cells, the resident stem cells of skeletal muscle.


RESULTS
here, we report on the dynamics of postnatal myofibre growth in the mouse extensor digitorum longus  muscle, which is essentially composed of fast type ii fibres in adult. we found that there was no net gain in myofibre number in the edl between p <dig> and p <dig> . however, myofibre cross-sectional area increased by  <dig> -fold, and length by  <dig> -fold between these ages, resulting in an increase in total myofibre volume of  <dig> -fold: showing the extent of myofibre hypertrophy during the postnatal period. to determine how the number of myonuclei changes during this period of intense muscle fibre hypertrophy, we used two complementary mouse models: 3f-nlacz-e mice express nlacz only in myonuclei, while myf5nlacz/+ mice have β-galactosidase activity in satellite cells. there was a ~5-fold increase in myonuclear number per myofibre between p <dig> and p <dig>  thus myofibre hypertrophy is initially accompanied by a significant addition of myonuclei. despite this, the estimated myonuclear domain still doubled between p <dig> and p <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> μm <dig>  there was no further addition of myonuclei from p <dig>  but myofibre volume continued to increase, resulting in an estimated ~3-fold expansion of the myonuclear domain to  <dig>  ×  <dig> μm <dig> by p <dig>  we also used our two mouse models to determine the number of satellite cells per myofibre during postnatal growth. satellite cell number in edl was initially ~ <dig> satellite cells per myofibre at p <dig>  but then fell to reach the adult level of ~ <dig> by p <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
postnatal fast muscle fibre type growth is divided into distinct phases in mouse edl: myofibre hypertrophy is initially supported by a rapid increase in the number of myonuclei, but nuclear addition stops around p <dig>  since the significant myofibre hypertrophy from p <dig> to adulthood occurs without the net addition of new myonuclei, a considerable expansion of the myonuclear domain results. satellite cell numbers are initially stable, but then decrease to reach the adult level by p <dig>  thus the adult number of both myonuclei and satellite cells is already established by three weeks of postnatal growth in mouse.
