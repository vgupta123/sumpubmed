BACKGROUND
the functional immaturity of t cells contributes to the susceptibility of neonates to infections and the less severe graft-versus-host disease associated with cord blood  transplantation. we have previously reported that insulin-like growth factor â€“ i  promotes the phytohaemagglutinin -induced cb t cell maturation and inhibits their apoptosis in mononuclear cell  culture. we hypothesized that the effects of igf-i may be mediated by accessory cells and soluble factors.


RESULTS
this study showed that the kinetics of pha-induced maturation in purified cd3+ t cell was delayed compared to that in cbmc. the addition of autologous cd14+ monocytes increased t cell maturation and potentiated the effect of igf-i. the addition of il- <dig> had no effect on cb t cell maturation but it reduced pha-induced apoptosis significantly. we further demonstrated that the neutralisation of il- <dig> in cbmc culture partially abrogated the anti-apoptotic effect of igf- <dig> on t cells. the anti-apoptotic effect of il- <dig> was not mediated via the reduction of fas expression in t cell subsets.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggested that the maturation effect of igf- <dig> is partially mediated by monocytes and the anti-apoptotic effect in part via il- <dig>  further investigation is needed to explore the therapeutic use of igf-i in enhancing neonatal immunity.
