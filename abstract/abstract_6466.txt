BACKGROUND
leukocytes commonly infiltrate solid tumors, and have been implicated in the mechanism of spontaneous regression in some cancers. conventional techniques for the quantitative estimation of leukocyte infiltrates in tumors rely on light microscopy of immunostained thin tissue sections, in which an arbitrary assessment  of antigen density is made by the pathologist. these estimates are relatively subjective and often require the opinion of a second pathologist. in addition, since thin tissue sections are cut, no data regarding the three-dimensional distribution of antigen can be obtained.


RESULTS
to overcome these problems, we have designed a method to enumerate leukocyte infiltration into tumors, using confocal laser scanning microscopy of fluorescently immunostained leukocytes in thick tissue sections. using image analysis software, a threshold was applied to eliminate unstained tissue and residual noise. the total antigen volume in the scanned tissue was calculated and divided by the mean cell volume  to obtain the cell count. using this method, we compared the calculated leukocyte counts with those obtained manually by ten laboratory personnel. there was no significant difference  between the cell counts obtained by either method.

we then compared leukocyte infiltration into seven tumors and matched non-malignant tissue obtained from the periphery of the resected tissue. there was a significant increase in the infiltration of all leukocyte subsets into the tumors compared to minimal numbers in the non-malignant tissue.


CONCLUSIONS
from these results we conclude that this method may be of considerable use for the enumeration of cells in tissues. furthermore, since it can be performed by laboratory technical staff, less time input is required by the pathologist in assessing the degree of leukocyte infiltration into tumors.
