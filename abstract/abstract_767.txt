BACKGROUND
soybean ) resistance to any population of heterodera glycines , or fusarium virguliforme  required a functional allele at rhg1/rfs <dig>  h. glycines, the soybean cyst nematode  was an ancient, endemic, pest of soybean whereas f. virguliforme causal agent of sudden death syndrome , was a recent, regional, pest. this study examined the role of a receptor like kinase  gmrlk18- <dig>  within the rhg1/rfs <dig> locus in causing resistance to scn and sds.


RESULTS
a bac  encompassing the rhg1/rfs <dig> locus was sequenced from a resistant cultivar and compared to the sequences of two susceptible cultivars from which  <dig> snps were found. sequence alignments inferred that the resistance allele was an introgressed region of about 59â€‰kbp at the center of which the gmrlk18- <dig> was the most polymorphic gene and encoded protein. analyses were made of plants that were either heterozygous at, or transgenic  with, the resistance allele of gmrlk18- <dig>  those plants infested with either h. glycines or f. virguliforme showed that the allele for resistance was dominant. in the absence of rhg <dig> the gmrlk18- <dig> was sufficient to confer nearly complete resistance to both root and leaf symptoms of sds caused by f. virguliforme and provided partial resistance to three different populations of nematodes . in the presence of rhg <dig> the plants with the transgene were nearly classed as fully resistant to scn  as well as sds. a reduction in the rate of early seedling root development was also shown to be caused by the resistance allele of the gmrlk18- <dig>  field trials of transgenic plants showed an increase in foliar susceptibility to insect herbivory.


CONCLUSIONS
the inference that soybean has adapted part of an existing pathogen recognition and defense cascade  to a new pathogen  has broad implications for crop improvement. stable resistance to many pathogens might be achieved by manipulation the genes encoding a small number of pathogen recognition proteins.
