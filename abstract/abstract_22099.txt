BACKGROUND
blosum matrices belong to the most commonly used substitution matrix series for protein homology search and sequence alignments since their publication in  <dig>  in  <dig>  styczynski et al. discovered miscalculations in the clustering step of the matrix computation. still, the rblosum <dig> matrix based on the corrected blosum code was reported to perform worse at a statistically significant level than the blosum <dig> 

here, we present a further correction of the blosum code and provide a thorough performance analysis of blosum-, rblosum- and the newly derived corblosum-type matrices. thereby, we assess homology search performance of these matrix-types derived from three different blocks databases on all versions of the astral <dig>  astral <dig> and astral <dig> subsets resulting in  <dig> different benchmarks in total. our analysis is focused on two of the most popular blosum matrices — blosum <dig> and blosum <dig> 


RESULTS
our study shows that fixing small errors in the blosum code results in substantially different substitution matrices with a beneficial influence on homology search performance when compared to the original matrices. the corblosum matrices introduced here performed at least as good as their blosum counterparts in ∼ <dig> % of all test cases. on up-to-date astral databases blosum matrices were even outperformed by corblosum matrices in more than  <dig> % of the times. in contrast to the study by styczynski et al., the tested rblosum matrices also outperformed the corresponding blosum matrices in most of the cases. comparing the corblosum with the rblosum matrices revealed no general performance advantages for either on older astral releases. on up-to-date astral databases however corblosum matrices performed better than their rblosum counterparts in ∼ <dig> % of the test cases.


CONCLUSIONS
our results imply that corblosum type matrices outperform the blosum matrices on a statistically significant level in most of the cases, especially on up-to-date databases such as astral ≥ <dig> . additionally, corblosum matrices are closer to those originally intended by henikoff and henikoff on a conceptual level. hence, we encourage the usage of corblosum over blosum matrices for the task of homology search.
