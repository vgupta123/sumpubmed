BACKGROUND
whole genome sequencing provides the most comprehensive collection of an organism’s genetic information. the availability of complete genome sequences is expected to dramatically deliver a high impact on biology. however, to achieve this impact in the area of crop improvement, significant efforts are still required on functional genomics, including the areas of gene annotation, cloning, expression profiling, and functional validation.


RESULTS
here we report our efforts in generating the first transcription factor  open reading frame eome resource associated with drought resistance in soybean , a major oil/protein crop grown worldwide. this study provides a highly annotated soybean tf-orfeome associated with drought resistance. it contains information from experimentally verified protein-coding sequences , expression profiling under several abiotic stresses , and computationally predicted protein subcellular localization and cis-regulatory elements  analysis. all the information is available to plant researchers through a freely accessible and user-friendly database, soybean knowledge base .


CONCLUSIONS
the soybean tf-orfeome provides a valuable public resource for functional genomics studies, especially in the area of plant abiotic stresses. it will accelerate findings in the areas of abiotic stresses and lead to the generation of crops with enhanced resistance to multiple stresses.
