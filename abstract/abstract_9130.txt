BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a class of non-protein-coding genes that play a crucial regulatory role in mammalian development and disease. whereas a large number of mirnas have been annotated at the structural level during the latest years, functional annotation is sparse. actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae  causes serious lung infections in pigs. severe damage to the lungs, in many cases deadly, is caused by toxins released by the bacterium and to some degree by host mediated tissue damage. however, understanding of the role of micrornas in the course of this infectious disease in porcine is still very limited.


RESULTS
in this study, the rna extracted from visually unaffected and necrotic tissue from pigs infected with actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was subjected to small rna deep sequencing. we identified  <dig> conserved and  <dig> candidate novel micrornas in the pig. of these,  <dig> were significantly up-regulated in the necrotic sample and  <dig> were down-regulated. the expression analysis of a number of candidates revealed micrornas of potential importance in the innate immune response. mir- <dig>  a known key player in inflammation, was found expressed in both samples. moreover, mir-664-5p, mir- <dig> and mir-15a appear as very promising candidates for micrornas involved in response to pathogen infection.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study revealing significant differences in composition and expression profiles of mirnas in lungs infected with a bacterial pathogen. our results extend annotation of microrna in pig and provide insight into the role of a number of micrornas in regulation of bacteria induced immune and inflammatory response in porcine lung.
