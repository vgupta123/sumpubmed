BACKGROUND
 <dig> pyrosequencing is a commonly used massively parallel dna sequencing technology with a wide variety of application fields such as epigenetics, metagenomics and transcriptomics. a well-known problem of this platform is its sensitivity to base-calling insertion and deletion errors, particularly in the presence of long homopolymers. in addition, the base-call quality scores are not informative with respect to whether an insertion or a deletion error is more likely. surprisingly, not much effort has been devoted to the development of improved base-calling methods and more intuitive quality scores for this platform.


RESULTS
we present hpcall, a  <dig> base-calling method based on a weighted hurdle poisson model. hpcall uses a probabilistic framework to call the homopolymer lengths in the sequence by modeling well-known  <dig> noise predictors. base-calling quality is assessed based on estimated probabilities for each homopolymer length, which are easily transformed to useful quality scores.


CONCLUSIONS
using a reference data set of the escherichia coli k- <dig> strain, we show that hpcall produces superior quality scores that are very informative towards possible insertion and deletion errors, while maintaining a base-calling accuracy that is better than the current one. given the generality of the framework, hpcall has the potential to also adapt to other homopolymer-sensitive sequencing technologies.
