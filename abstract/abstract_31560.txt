BACKGROUND
multiple profilin isoforms exist in mammals; at least four are expressed in the mammalian testis. the testis-specific isoforms profilin- <dig>  and profilin- <dig>  may have specialized roles in spermatogenic cells which are distinct from known functions fulfilled by the "somatic" profilins, profilin- <dig>  and profilin- <dig> .


RESULTS
ligand interactions and spatial distributions of pfn <dig> and pfn <dig> were compared by biochemical, molecular and immunological methods; pfn <dig> and pfn <dig> were employed as controls. Î²-actin, phosphoinositides, poly-l-proline and mdia <dig>  but not vasp, were confirmed as in vitro interaction partners of pfn <dig>  in parallel experiments, pfn <dig> bound to selected phosphoinositides but not to poly-l-proline, proline-rich proteins, or actin. immunofluorescence microscopy of pfn <dig> and pfn <dig> revealed distinct subcellular locations in differentiating spermatids. both were associated first with the acroplaxome and later with the transient manchette. predicted 3d structures indicated that pfn <dig> has the actin-binding site conserved, but retains only approximately half of the common poly-l-proline binding site. pfn <dig>  in comparison, has lost both, polyproline and actin binding sites completely, which is well in line with the experimental data.


CONCLUSIONS
the testis-specific isoform pfn <dig> showed major hallmarks of the well characterized "somatic" profilin isoforms, albeit with distinct binding affinities. pfn <dig>  on the other hand, did not interact with actin or polyproline in vitro. rather, it seemed to be specialized for phospholipid binding, possibly providing cellular functions which are distinct from actin dynamics regulation.
