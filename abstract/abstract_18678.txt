BACKGROUND
the homeodomain containing transcription factor nkx <dig>  is essential for the differentiation of pancreatic endocrine cells. deletion of nkx <dig>  in mice leads to misspecification of islet cell types; insulin-expressing β cells and glucagon-expressing α cells are replaced by ghrelin-expressing cells. additional studies have suggested that nkx <dig>  functions both as a transcriptional repressor and activator to regulate islet cell formation and function. to identify genes that are potentially regulated by nkx <dig>  during the major wave of endocrine and exocrine cell differentiation, we assessed gene expression changes that occur in the absence of nkx <dig>  at the onset of the secondary transition in the developing pancreas.


RESULTS
microarray analysis identified  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed in e <dig>  and/or e <dig>  nkx <dig> -/- embryos. some of these genes encode transcription factors that have been previously identified in the pancreas, clarifying the position of nkx <dig>  within the islet transcriptional regulatory pathway. we also identified signaling factors and transmembrane proteins that function downstream of nkx <dig> , including several that have not previously been described in the pancreas. interestingly, a number of known exocrine genes are also misexpressed in the nkx <dig> -/- pancreas.


CONCLUSIONS
expression profiling of nkx <dig> -/- mice during embryogenesis has allowed us to identify known and novel pancreatic genes that function downstream of nkx <dig>  to regulate pancreas development. several of the newly identified signaling factors and transmembrane proteins may function to influence islet cell fate decisions. these studies have also revealed a novel function for nkx <dig>  in maintaining appropriate exocrine gene expression. most importantly, nkx <dig>  appears to function within a complex regulatory loop with ngn <dig> at a key endocrine differentiation step.
