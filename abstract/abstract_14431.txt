BACKGROUND
fusarium graminearum causes fusarium head blight , a major disease problem worldwide. resistance to fhb is controlled by quantitative trait loci  of which two are located on barley chromosomes 2h bin <dig> and 6h bin <dig>  the mechanisms of resistance mediated by fhb qtl are poorly defined.


RESULTS
near-isogenic lines  carrying chevron-derived resistant alleles for the two qtl were developed and exhibited fhb resistance in field trials. to understand the molecular responses associated with resistance, transcriptomes of the nils and recurrent parents  were investigated with rna sequencing  after f. graminearum or mock inoculation. a total of  <dig> fhb-responsive transcripts were detected and provide a gene expression atlas for the barley-f. graminearum interaction. comparative analysis of the 2hb <dig> resistant  nil and m <dig> revealed that the 2hb <dig> r nil exhibited an elevated defense response in the absence of fungal infection and responded quicker than m <dig> upon fungal infection. the 6hb <dig> r nil displayed a more rapid induction of a set of defense genes than lacey during the early stage of fungal infection. overlap of differentially accumulated genes were identified between the two r nils, suggesting that certain responses may represent basal resistance to f. graminearum and/or general biotic stress response and were expressed by both resistant genotypes. long noncoding rnas  have emerged as potential key regulators of transcription. a total of  <dig>  lncrnas were identified, of which  <dig> were fhb responsive.


CONCLUSIONS
the current transcriptomic analysis revealed differential responses conferred by two qtl during f. graminearum infection and identified genes and lncrnas that were associated with fhb resistance.
