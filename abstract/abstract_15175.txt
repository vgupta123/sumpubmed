BACKGROUND
the mrna translation initiation region  comprises the initiator codon, shine-dalgarno  sequence and translational enhancers. probably the most abundant class of enhancers contains a/u-rich sequences. we have tested the influence of sd sequence length and the presence of enhancers on the efficiency of translation initiation.


RESULTS
we found that during bacterial growth at 37Â°c, a six-nucleotide sd  is more efficient than shorter or longer sequences. the a/u-rich enhancer contributes strongly to the efficiency of initiation, having the greatest stimulatory effect in the exponential growth phase of the bacteria. the sd sequences and the a/u-rich enhancer stimulate translation co-operatively: strong sds are stimulated by the enhancer much more than weak sds. the bacterial growth rate does not have a major influence on the tir selection pattern. on the other hand, temperature affects the tir preference pattern: shorter sd sequences are preferred at lower growth temperatures. we also performed an in silico analysis of the tirs in all e. coli mrnas. the base pairing potential of the sd sequences does not correlate with the codon adaptation index, which is used as an estimate of gene expression level.


CONCLUSIONS
in e. coli the sd selection preferences are influenced by the growth temperature and not influenced by the growth rate. the a/u rich enhancers stimulate translation considerably by acting co-operatively with the sd sequences.
