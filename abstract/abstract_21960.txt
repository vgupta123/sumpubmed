BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is major human and animal pathogen. plasmids often carry resistance genes and virulence genes that can disseminate through s. aureus populations by horizontal gene transfer  mechanisms. sequences of s. aureus plasmids in the public domain and data from multi-strain microarrays were analysed to investigate  the distribution of resistance genes and virulence genes on s. aureus plasmids, and  the distribution of plasmids between s. aureus lineages.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> plasmid rep gene families, of which  <dig> were novel to this study, were characterised using a previously proposed classification system.  <dig> sequenced plasmids were assigned to  <dig> plasmid groups that each possessed a unique combination of rep genes. we show some resistance genes  and virulence genes  were associated with specific plasmid groups suggesting there are genetic pressures preventing recombination of these genes into novel plasmid groups. whole genome microarray analysis revealed that plasmid rep, resistance and virulence genes were associated with s. aureus lineages, suggesting restriction-modification  barriers to hgt of plasmids between strains exist. conjugation transfer  complex genes were rare.


CONCLUSIONS
this study argues that genetic pressures are restraining the spread of resistance and virulence genes amongst s. aureus plasmids, and amongst s. aureus populations, delaying the emergence of fully virulent and resistant strains.
