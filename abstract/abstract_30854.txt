BACKGROUND
the x and y sex chromosomes are conspicuous features of placental mammal genomes. mammalian sex chromosomes arose from an ordinary pair of autosomes after the proto-y acquired a male-determining gene and degenerated due to suppression of x-y recombination. analysis of earlier steps in x chromosome evolution has been hampered by the long interval between the origins of teleost and amniote lineages as well as scarcity of x chromosome orthologs in incomplete avian genome assemblies.


RESULTS
this study clarifies the genesis and remodelling of the eutherian x chromosome by using a combination of sequence analysis, meiotic map information, and cytogenetic localization to compare amniote genome organization with that of the amphibian xenopus tropicalis. nearly all orthologs of human x genes localize to x. tropicalis chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  consistent with an ancestral x-conserved region and a single x-added region precursor. this finding contradicts a previous hypothesis of three evolutionary strata in this region. homologies between human, opossum, chicken and frog chromosomes suggest a single x-added region predecessor in therian mammals, corresponding to opossum chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  a more ancient x-added ancestral region, currently extant as a major part of chicken chromosome  <dig>  is likely to have been present in the progenitor of synapsids and sauropsids. analysis of x chromosome gene content emphasizes conservation of single protein coding genes and the role of tandem arrays in formation of novel genes.


CONCLUSIONS
chromosomal regions orthologous to therian x chromosomes have been located in the genome of the frog x. tropicalis. these x chromosome ancestral components experienced a series of fusion and breakage events to give rise to avian autosomes and mammalian sex chromosomes. the early branching tetrapod x. tropicalisâ€™ simple diploid genome and robust synteny to amniotes greatly enhances studies of vertebrate chromosome evolution.
