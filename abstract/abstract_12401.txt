BACKGROUND
the exponential growth of next-generation sequencing  derived dna data poses great challenges to data storage and transmission. although many compression algorithms have been proposed for dna reads in ngs data, few methods are designed specifically to handle the quality scores.


RESULTS
in this paper we present a memetic algorithm  based ngs quality score data compressor, namely mmqsc. the algorithm extracts raw quality score sequences from fastq formatted files, and designs compression codebook using ma based multimodal optimization. the input data is then compressed in a substitutional manner. experimental results on five representative ngs data sets show that mmqsc obtains higher compression ratio than the other state-of-the-art methods. particularly, mmqsc is a lossless reference-free compression algorithm, yet obtains an average compression ratio of  <dig> % on the experimental data sets.


CONCLUSIONS
the proposed mmqsc compresses ngs quality score data effectively. it can be utilized to improve the overall compression ratio on fastq formatted files.
