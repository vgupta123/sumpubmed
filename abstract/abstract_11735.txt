BACKGROUND
longitudinal samples from two production sites were used to  describe the pattern of pedv shedding  in individual rectal swabs, pen fecal samples, and pen oral fluids ;  describe the kinetics of pedv antibody by elisa  testing of pig serum and pen oral fluid samples; and  establish cutoffs and performance estimates for pedv wv elisas . site one was pedv positive; site two was pedv negative. on site one, pen samples  and pig samples  were collected both before and after the population was exposed to pedv.


RESULTS
on site two, pen oral fluid samples and individual pig serum samples were negative for both pedv antibody and nucleic acid. on site one, pedv was detected by rrt-pcr at 6 days post exposure  in all sample types. the last rrt-pcr positives were detected in rectal swabs and oral fluids on  <dig> dpe. igg and iga were detected in oral fluids and serum samples by  <dig> dpe. analysis of the pedv serum igg wv elisa data showed that a sample-to-positive  cutoff of ≥  <dig>  provided a diagnostic sensitivity of  <dig>   and specificity of  <dig>  . serum igg results declined slowly over the monitoring period, with 60 % of serum samples positive  at the final sampling on  <dig> dpe. analysis of the pedv oral fluid iga wv elisa found that a cutoff of s/p ≥  <dig>  provided a diagnostic sensitivity of  <dig>   and a diagnostic specificity of  <dig>  . the oral fluid iga response increased through  <dig> dpe and began to decline at the last sampling on  <dig> dpe.


CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that oral fluid-based testing could provide an easy and “animal-friendly” approach to sample collection for nucleic acid and/or antibody-based surveillance of pedv in swine populations.
