BACKGROUND
the human genome contains a large amount of cis-regulatory dna elements responsible for directing both spatial and temporal gene-expression patterns. previous studies have shown that based on their mrna expression breast tumors could be divided into five subgroups , each with a distinct molecular portrait. whole genome gene expression analysis of independent sets of breast tumors reveals repeatedly the robustness of this classification. furthermore, breast tumors carrying a tp <dig> mutation show a distinct gene expression profile, which is in strong association to the distinct molecular portraits. the mrna expression of  <dig> genes, which varied considerably among the different tumors, but little between two samples of the same tumor, has been shown to be sufficient to separate these tumor subgroups.


RESULTS
we analyzed in silico the transcriptional regulation of genes defining the subgroups at  <dig> different levels:  <dig>  we studied the pathways in which the genes distinguishing the subgroups of breast cancer may be jointly involved including upstream regulators  as well as downstream targets of these genes.  <dig>  then we analyzed the promoter areas of these genes  for canonical transcription binding sites using genomatix.  <dig>  we looked for the actual expression levels of the identified tf and how they correlate with the overrepresentation of their tf binding sites in the separate groups. we report that promoter composition of the genes that most strongly predict the patient subgroups is distinct. the class-predictive genes showed a clearly different degree of overrepresentation of transcription factor families in their promoter sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
the study suggests that transcription factors responsible for the observed expression pattern in breast cancers may lead us to important biological pathways.
