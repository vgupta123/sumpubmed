BACKGROUND
dystonia <dig>  dystonia is caused by a glutamic acid deletion  mutation in the gene encoding torsin a in humans . to investigate the unknown molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying dyt <dig> dystonia, we performed an unbiased proteomic analysis.


RESULTS
we found that the amount of proteins and transcripts of an endoplasmic reticulum  resident chaperone heat shock protein cognate  <dig>  and a mitochondria chaperone heat shock protein  <dig>  were significantly increased in the htoraΔe– expressing brains compared to the normal htora  expressing brains. the physiological consequences included an increased susceptibility to oxidative and er stress compared to normal htorawt flies. the alteration of transcripts of inositol-requiring enzyme- <dig> -dependent spliced x box binding protein  <dig>  several er chaperones, a nucleotide exchange factor, autophagy related protein 8b  and components of the er associated degradation  pathway and increased expression of the xbp1-enhanced green fluorescence protein  in htoraΔe brains strongly indicated the activation of the unfolded protein response . in addition, perturbed expression of the upr sensors and inducers in the htoraΔedrosophila brains resulted in a significantly reduced life span of the flies. furthermore, the types and quantities of proteins present in the anti-hsc <dig> positive microsomes in the htoraΔe brains were different from those of the htorawt brains.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these data show that htoraΔe in drosophila brains may activate the upr and increase the expression of hsp <dig> to compensate for the toxic effects caused by htoraΔe in the brains.
