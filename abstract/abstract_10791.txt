BACKGROUND
the present study was conducted to determine the location, the morphology and distribution of nadph-diaphorase positive neurons in the cardiac nerve plexus of the atria of mice . this plexus lies over the muscular layer of the atria, dorsal to the muscle itself, in the connective tissue of the subepicardium. nadph- diaphorase staining was performed on whole-mount preparations of the atria mice. for descriptive purposes, all data are presented as means ± sem.


RESULTS
the majority of the nadph-diaphorase positive neurons were observed in the ganglia of the plexus. a few single neurons were also observed. the number of nadph-d positive neurons was  <dig> ±  <dig> . the ganglion neurons were located in  <dig> distinct groups:  in the region situated cranial to the pulmonary veins,  caudally to the pulmonary veins, and  in the atrial groove. the largest group of neurons was located cranially to the pulmonary veins . three morphological types of nadph-diaphorase neurons could be distinguished on the basis of their shape: unipolar cells, bipolar cells and cells with three processes . the unipolar neurons predominated , whereas the multipolar were encountered less frequently . the sizes  of the neurons ranged from about  <dig> μm2to about  <dig> μm <dig>  morphometrically, the three types of neurons were similar and there were no significant differences in their sizes. the total number of cardiac neurons  was  <dig> ±  <dig>  therefore, the nadph-diaphorase positive neurons of the heart represent 10% of the number of cardiac neurons stained by nadh.


CONCLUSIONS
the obtained data have shown that the nadph-d positive neurons in the cardiac plexus of the atria of mice are morphologically different, and therefore, it is possible that the function of the neurons may also be different.
