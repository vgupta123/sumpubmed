BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  is the cause of an economically important swine disease that has devastated the swine industry since the late 1980s. the aim of the present study was to investigate the interaction between reactive oxygen species  and nf-κb by prrsv infection.


RESULTS
we isolated the local strain of prrsv from southwest china, designated yn- <dig>  then sequenced and analyzed the genome. yn- <dig> was then used to evaluate the interaction of ros and nf-κb. in prrsv infected marc- <dig> cells, there was a time-dependent increase in ros and maleic dialdehyde . accordingly, nf-κb activation was also increased as prrsv infection progressed. degradation of iκb mrna was detected late in prrsv infection, and overexpression of the dominant negative form of iκbα significantly suppressed nf-κb induced by prrsv.


CONCLUSIONS
the results indicate that the generation of ros is involved in prrsv replication and this progression is associated with the alteration in nf-κb activity induced by ros. these results should extend our better understanding the interaction between prrsv and host marc- <dig> cells.
