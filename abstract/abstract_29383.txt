BACKGROUND
the filamentous fungus trichoderma reesei  is an important source of cellulases for use in the textile and alternative fuel industries. to fully understand the regulation of cellulase production in t. reesei, the role of a gene known to be involved in carbon regulation in aspergillus nidulans, but unstudied in t. reesei, was investigated.


RESULTS
the t. reesei orthologue of the a. nidulans creb gene, designated cre <dig>  was identified and shown to be functional through heterologous complementation of a creb mutation in a. nidulans. a t. reesei strain was constructed using gene disruption techniques that contained a disrupted cre <dig> gene. this strain, jktr2- <dig>  exhibited phenotypes similar to the a. nidulans creb mutant strain both in carbon catabolite repressing, and in carbon catabolite derepressing conditions. importantly, the disruption also led to elevated cellulase levels.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate that cre <dig> is involved in cellulase expression. since the disruption of cre <dig> increases the amount of cellulase activity, without severe morphological affects, targeting creb orthologues for disruption in other industrially useful filamentous fungi, such as aspergillus oryzae, trichoderma harzianum or aspergillus niger may also lead to elevated hydrolytic enzyme activity in these species.
