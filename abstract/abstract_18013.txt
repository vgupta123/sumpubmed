BACKGROUND
multilocus sequence typing  is currently the reference method for genotyping streptococcus agalactiae strains, the leading cause of infectious disease in newborns and a major cause of disease in immunocompromised children and adults. we describe here a genotyping method based on multiple locus variable number of tandem repeat  analysis  applied to a population of s. agalactiae strains of various origins characterized by mlst and serotyping.


RESULTS
we studied a collection of  <dig> strains isolated from humans and cattle and three reference strains . among  <dig> vntrs,  <dig> polymorphic vntrs loci were selected for use in genotyping of the bacterial population. the mlva profile consists of a series of allele numbers, corresponding to the number of repeats at each vntr locus.  <dig> mlva genotypes were obtained compared to  <dig> sequences types generated by mlst. the mlva scheme generated clusters which corresponded well to the main clonal complexes obtained by mlst. however it provided a higher discriminatory power. the diversity index obtained with mlva was  <dig>  compared to  <dig>  with mlst for this population of strains.


CONCLUSIONS
the mlva scheme proposed here is a rapid, cheap and easy genotyping method generating results suitable for exchange and comparison between different laboratories and for the epidemiologic surveillance of s. agalactiae and analyses of outbreaks.
