BACKGROUND
the lycophytes are an ancient lineage of vascular plants that diverged from the seed plant lineage about  <dig> myr ago. although the lycophytes occupy an important phylogenetic position for understanding the evolution of plants and their genomes, no genomic resources exist for this group of plants.


RESULTS
here we describe the construction of a large-insert bacterial artificial chromosome  library from the lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii. based on cell flow cytometry, this species has the smallest genome size among the different lycophytes tested, including huperzia lucidula, diphaiastrum digita, isoetes engelmanii and s. kraussiana. the arrayed bac library consists of  <dig> clones; the average insert size is estimated to be  <dig> kb. inserts of chloroplast origin account for  <dig> % of the clones. the bac library contains an estimated ten genome-equivalents based on dna hybridizations using five single-copy and two duplicated s. moellendorffii genes as probes.


CONCLUSIONS
the s. moellenforffii bac library, the first to be constructed from a lycophyte, will be useful to the scientific community as a resource for comparative plant genomics and evolution.
