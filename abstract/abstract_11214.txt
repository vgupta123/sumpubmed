BACKGROUND
micrornas are a group of small rnas that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. they regulate almost every aspect of cellular processes. in this study, we investigated whether mir-27b regulates pulmonary fibroblast activation.


RESULTS
we found that mir-27b was down-regulated in fibrotic lungs and fibroblasts from an experimental mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis. the overexpression of mir-27b with a lentiviral vector inhibited tgfβ1-stimulated mrna expression of collagens  and alpha-smooth muscle actin, and protein expression of col3a <dig> and alpha-smooth muscle actin in ll <dig> human pulmonary fibroblasts. mir-27b also reduced contractile activity of ll <dig>  tgfβ receptor  <dig> and smad <dig> were identified as the targets of mir-27b by 3’-untranslated region luciferase reporter and western blotting assays.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that mir-27b is an anti-fibrotic microrna that inhibits fibroblast activation by targeting tgfβ receptor  <dig> and smad <dig>  this discovery may provide new targets for therapeutic interventions of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
