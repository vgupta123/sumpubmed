BACKGROUND
feline infectious peritonitis  is a fatal disease caused by feline coronavirus . fcovs are divided into two serotypes with markedly different infection rates among cat populations around the world. a baculovirus-expressed type-specific domain of the spike proteins of fcov was used to survey the infection of the two viruses over the past eight years in taiwan.


RESULTS
an immunofluorescence assay based on cells infected with the recombinant viruses that was capable of distinguishing between the two types of viral infection was established. a total of  <dig> cases from a teaching hospital was surveyed for prevalence of different fcov infections. infection of the type i fcov was dominant, with a seropositive rate of  <dig> %, whereas  <dig> % of cats were infected with the type ii fcov. in most cases, results derived from serotyping and genotyping were highly agreeable. however,  <dig> %  fip cats and  <dig> %  clinically healthy cats were found to possess antibodies against both viruses. moreover, most of the cats  infected with a genotypic untypable virus bearing a type i fcov antibody.


CONCLUSIONS
a relatively simple serotyping method to distinguish between two types of fcov infection was developed. based on this method, two types of fcov infection in taiwan was first carried out. type i fcov was found to be predominant compared with type ii virus. results derived from serotyping and genotyping support our current understanding of evolution of disease-related fcov and transmission of fip.
