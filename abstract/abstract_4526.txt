BACKGROUND
breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women and drug resistance is the major obstacle for its successful chemotherapy. in the present study, we analyzed the involvement of an oncofetal gene, sal-like  <dig> , in the tumor proliferation and drug resistance of human breast cancer.


RESULTS
our study showed that sall <dig> was up-regulated in the drug resistant breast cancer cell line, mcf-7/adr, compared to the other five cell lines. we established the lentiviral system expressing short hairpin rna to knockdown sall <dig> in mcf-7/adr cells. down-regulation of sall <dig> inhibited the proliferation of mcf-7/adr cells and induced the g <dig> phase arrest in cell cycle, accompanied by an obvious reduction of the expression of cyclind <dig> and cdk <dig>  besides, down-regulating sall <dig> can re-sensitize mcf-7/adr to doxorubicin hydrochloride  and had potent synergy with admh in mcf-7/adr cells. depletion of sall <dig> led to a decrease in ic <dig> for admh and an inhibitory effect on the ability to form colonies in mcf-7/adr cells. with sall <dig> knockdown, admh accumulation rate of mcf-7/adr cells was increased, while the expression of bcrp and c-myc was significantly decreased. furthermore, silencing sall <dig> also suppressed the growth of the xenograft tumors and reversed their resistance to admh in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
sall <dig> knockdown inhibits the growth of the drug resistant breast cancer due to cell cycle arrest and reverses tumor chemo-resistance through down-regulating the membrane transporter, bcpr. thus, sall <dig> has potential as a novel target for the treatment of breast cancer.
