BACKGROUND
nac proteins , ataf  and cuc ) are plant-specific transcription factors reported to be involved in regulating growth, development and stress responses. salinity responsive transcriptome profiling in a set of contrasting finger millet genotypes through rna-sequencing resulted in the identification of a nac homolog  exhibiting differential salinity responsive expression pattern.

methods
full length cdna of ecnac <dig> was isolated, characterized and validated for its role in abiotic stress tolerance through agrobacterium mediated genetic transformation in a rice cultivar asd <dig> 


RESULTS
bioinformatics analysis of putative nac transcription factor  isolated from a salinity tolerant finger millet showed its genetic relatedness to nac <dig> family tfs in related cereals. putative transgenic lines of rice over-expressing ecnac <dig> were generated through agrobacterium mediated transformation and presence/integration of transgene was confirmed through pcr and southern hybridization analysis. transgenic rice plants harboring ecnac <dig> showed enhanced tolerance against drought and salinity under greenhouse conditions. transgenic rice plants were found to possess higher root and shoot biomass during stress and showed better revival ability upon relief from salinity stress. upon drought stress, transgenic lines were found to maintain higher relative water content and lesser reduction in grain yield when compared to non-transgenic asd <dig> plants. drought induced spikelet sterility was found to be much lower in the transgenic lines than the non-transgenic asd <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
results revealed the significant role of ecnac <dig> in modulating responses against dehydration stress in rice. no detectable abnormalities in the phenotypic traits were observed in the transgenic plants under normal growth conditions. results indicate that ecnac <dig> can be used as a novel source for engineering tolerance against drought and salinity stress in rice and other crop plants.
