BACKGROUND
eukaryotic genome acquires functionality upon proper packaging within the nucleus. this process is facilitated by the structural framework of nuclear matrix, a nucleo-proteinaceous meshwork. matrix attachment regions  in the genome serve as anchoring sites to this framework.


RESULTS
here we report direct sequencing of the mar preparation from drosophila melanogaster embryos and identify > <dig> mars. this amounts to ~ <dig> % of the fly genome and often coincide with at rich non-coding regions. we find significant association of mars with the origins of replication, transcription start sites, paused rna polymerase ii sites and exons, but not introns, of highly expressed genes. we also identified sequence motifs and repeats that constitute mars.


CONCLUSIONS
our data reveal the contact points of genome to the nuclear architecture and provide a link between nuclear functions and genomic packaging.
