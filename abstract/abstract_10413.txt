BACKGROUND
drought stress is one of the most adverse environmental constraints to plant growth and productivity. comparative proteomics of drought-tolerant and sensitive wheat genotypes is a strategy to understand the complexity of molecular mechanism of wheat in response to drought. this study attempted to extend findings regarding the potential proteomic dynamics in wheat under drought stress and to enrich the research content of drought tolerance mechanism.


RESULTS
a comparative proteomics approach was applied to analyze proteome change of xihan no.  <dig>  and longchun  <dig>  subjected to a range of dehydration treatments  and rehydration treatment  using 2-de, respectively. quantitative image analysis showed a total of  <dig> protein spots in xihan no.  <dig> and  <dig> spots from longchun  <dig> with their abundance significantly altered  more than  <dig> -fold. out of these spots, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> differentially abundant proteins were identified by maldi-tof/tof ms in xihan no.  <dig> and longchun  <dig>  respectively. most of these identified proteins were involved in metabolism, photosynthesis, defence and protein translation/processing/degradation in both two cultivars. in addition, the proteins involved in redox homeostasis, energy, transcription, cellular structure, signalling and transport were also identified. furthermore, the comparative analysis of drought-responsive proteome allowed for the general elucidation of the major mechanisms associated with differential responses to drought of both two cultivars. these cellular processes work more cooperatively to re-establish homeostasis in xihan no.  <dig> than longchun  <dig>  the resistance mechanisms of xihan no.  <dig> mainly included changes in the metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids as well as in the activation of more antioxidation and defense systems and in the levels of proteins involved in atp synthesis and protein degradation/refolding.


CONCLUSIONS
this study revealed that the levels of a number of proteins involved in various cellular processes were affected by drought stress in two wheat cultivars with different drought tolerance. the results showed that there exist specific responses to drought in xihan no.  <dig> and longchun  <dig>  the proposed hypothetical model would explain the interaction of these identified proteins that are associated with drought-responses in two cultivars, and help in developing strategies to improve drought tolerance in wheat.
