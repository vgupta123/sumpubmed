BACKGROUND
α-synuclein  has been genetically implicated in familial and sporadic parkinson’s disease , and is associated with disease susceptibility, progression and pathology. excess amounts of αsyn are toxic to neurons. in the brain, microglial αsyn clearance is closely related to neuronal survival. leucine-rich repeat kinase  <dig>  is the one of the other genes implicated in familial and sporadic pd. while lrrk <dig> is known to be expressed in microglia, its true function remains to be elucidated. in this study, we investigated αsyn clearance by microglia isolated from lrrk2-knockout  mice.


RESULTS
in lrrk2-ko microglia, αsyn was taken up in larger amounts and cleared from the supernatant more effectively than for microglia isolated from wild-type  mice. this higher clearance ability of lrrk2-ko microglia was thought to be due to an increase of rab5-positive endosomes, but not rab7- or rab11-positive endosomes. increased engagement between rab <dig> and dynamin  <dig> was also observed in lrrk2-ko microglia.


CONCLUSIONS
lrrk <dig> negatively regulates the clearance of αsyn accompanied by down-regulation of the endocytosis pathway. our findings reveal a new functional role of lrrk <dig> in microglia and offer a new insight into the mechanism of pd pathogenesis.
