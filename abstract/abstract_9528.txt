BACKGROUND
high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits  have been considered as most important seed storage proteins for wheat flour quality. 1ay subunits are of great interest because they are always silent in common wheat. the presence of expressed 1ay subunits in diploid and tetraploid wheat genotypes makes it possible to investigate molecular information of active 1ay genes.


RESULTS
we identified 1ay subunits with different electrophoretic mobility from  <dig> accessions of diploid and tetraploid wheats, and obtained the complete orfs and 5' flanking sequences of 1ay genes including  <dig> active and  <dig> inactive ones. furthermore, the 5' flanking sequences were characterized from  <dig> wild diploid species of triticeae. all  <dig> active 1ay possess a typical hmw-gs primary structure and some novel characteristics. the conserved cysteine residue within the repetitive domain of y-type subunits was replaced by phenylalanine residue in subunits of 1ay , 1ay , 1ay  and 1ay . particularly, 1ay  has an unusual large molecular weight of  <dig> bp and was one of the known largest y-type hmw-gss. the translations of 1ay , 1ay  and 1ay  were disrupted by premature stop codons in their coding regions. the 5' flanking sequences of active and inactive 1ay genes differ in a few base substitutions and insertions or deletions. the  <dig> bp deletions have been found in promoter regions of all 1ay genes and the corresponding positions of  <dig> species from aegilops and hordeum.


CONCLUSIONS
the possession of larger molecular weight and fewer conserved cysteine residues are unique structural features of 1ay genes; it would be interested to express them in bread wheat and further to examine their impact to processing quality of wheat. the 1ay genes from t. urartu are closer to the genes from t. turgidum dicoccon and t. aestivum, than those from t. monococcum aegilopoides. the  <dig> bp deletion and some variations in the 5'flanking region, have not interrupted expression of 1ay genes, whereas the defects in the coding regions could be responsible to the silence of the 1ay genes. some mutational events in more distant distal promoter regions are also possible causes for the inactivation of 1ay genes.
