BACKGROUND
human extracellular superoxide dismutase  is a tetrameric metalloenzyme responsible for the removal of superoxide anions from the extracellular space. we have previously shown that the ec-sod subunit exists in two distinct folding variants based on differences in the disulfide bridge pattern :13875â€“80). one variant is enzymatically active  while the other is inactive . the ec-sod subunits are associated into covalently linked dimers through an inter-subunit disulfide bridge creating the theoretical possibility of  <dig> dimers  with different antioxidant potentials. we have analyzed the quaternary structure of the endogenous ec-sod disulfide-linked dimer to investigate if these dimers in fact exist.


RESULTS
the analyses of ec-sod purified from human tissue show that all three dimer combinations exist including two homo-dimers  and a hetero-dimer . because ec-sod is a tetramer the dimers may combine to generate  <dig> different mature ec-sod molecules where the specific activity of each molecule is determined by the ratio of aec-sod and iec-sod subunits.


CONCLUSIONS
this finding shows that the aec-sod and iec-sod subunits combine in all  <dig> possible ways supporting the presence of tetrameric enzymes with variable enzymatic activity. this variation in enzymatic potency may regulate the antioxidant level in the extracellular space and represent a novel way of modulating enzymatic activity.
