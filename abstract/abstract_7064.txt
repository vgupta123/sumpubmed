BACKGROUND
the phenotype of an organism is an outcome of both its genotype, encoding the primary sequence of proteins, and the developmental orchestration of gene expression. the substrate of gene expression in eukaryotes is the chromatin, whose fundamental units are nucleosomes composed of dna wrapped around each two of the core histone types h2a, h2b, h <dig> and h <dig>  key regulatory steps involved in the determination of chromatin conformations are posttranslational modifications  at histone tails as well as the assembly of histone variants into nucleosomal arrays. although the mechanistic background is fragmentary understood, it appears that the chromatin signature of metazoan cell types is inheritable over generations. even less understood is the conservation of epigenetic mechanisms among eukaryotes and their origins.


RESULTS
in the light of recent progress in understanding the tree of eukaryotic life we discovered the origin of histone h <dig> by phylogenetic analyses of variants from all supergroups, which allowed the reconstruction of ancestral states. we found that h <dig> variants evolved frequently but independently within related species of almost all eukaryotic supergroups. interestingly, we found all core histone types encoded in the genome of a basal dinoflagellate and h <dig> variants in two other species, although is was reported that dinoflagellate chromatin is not organized into nucleosomes.

most probably one or more animal/nuclearid h <dig> -like variants gave rise to h <dig> variants of all opisthokonts . h <dig>  and h <dig>  as well as h <dig> t are derivatives of h <dig> , whereas h <dig>  evolved already in early branching animals, such as trichoplax. h <dig>  and h <dig> t are probably restricted to mammals.

we deduced a model for protoh <dig> of the last eukaryotic common ancestor  confirming a remarkable degree of sequence conservation in comparison to canonical human h <dig> . we found evidence that multiple ptms are conserved even in putatively early branching eukaryotic taxa .


CONCLUSIONS
at least a basal repertoire of chromatin modifying mechanisms appears to share old common ancestry and may thus be inherent to all eukaryotes. we speculate that epigenetic principles responsive to environmental triggers may have had influenced phenotypic variation and concomitantly may potentially have had impact on eukaryotic diversification.
