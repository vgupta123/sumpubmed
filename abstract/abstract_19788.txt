BACKGROUND
carnation , in the family caryophyllaceae, can be found in a wide range of colors and is a model system for studies of flower senescence. in addition, it is one of the most important flowers in the global floriculture industry. however, few genomics resources, such as sequences and markers are available for carnation or other members of the caryophyllaceae. to increase our understanding of the genetic control of important characters in carnation, we generated an expressed sequence tag  database for a carnation cultivar important in horticulture by high-throughput sequencing using  <dig> pyrosequencing technology.


RESULTS
we constructed a normalized cdna library and a 3â€™-utr library of carnation, obtaining a total of  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads. these reads were assembled into  <dig>  unigenes consisting of  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singlets. the contigs were searched against an arabidopsis sequence database, and  <dig> %  of them had at least one blastx hit. these contigs were also annotated with gene ontology  and were found to cover a broad range of go categories. furthermore, we identified  <dig>  potential simple sequence repeats  in  <dig>  of the unigenes. we focused on gene discovery in the areas of flower color and ethylene biosynthesis. transcripts were identified for almost every gene involved in flower chlorophyll and carotenoid metabolism and in anthocyanin biosynthesis. transcripts were also identified for every step in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
we present the first large-scale sequence data set for carnation, generated using next-generation sequencing technology. the large est database generated from these sequences is an informative resource for identifying genes involved in various biological processes in carnation and provides an est resource for understanding the genetic diversity of this plant.
