BACKGROUND
small non-coding rnas  are regarded as important regulators in prokaryotes and play essential roles in diverse cellular processes. xanthomonas oryzae pathovar oryzae  is an important plant pathogenic bacterium which causes serious bacterial blight of rice. however, little is known about the number, genomic distribution and biological functions of srnas in xoo.


RESULTS
here, we performed a systematic screen to identify srnas in the xoo strain pxo <dig>  a total of  <dig> putative non-coding rna sequences originated from intergenic and gene antisense regions were identified by cloning, of which  <dig> were also identified as srna candidates by computational prediction, thus were considered as xoo srna candidates. northern blot hybridization confirmed the size and expression of  <dig> srna candidates and other  <dig> cloned small rna sequences, which were then added to the srna candidate list. we further examined the expression profiles of the eight srnas in an hfq deletion mutant and found that two of them showed drastically decreased expression levels, and another exhibited an hfq-dependent transcript processing pattern. deletion mutants were obtained for seven of the northern confirmed srnas, but none of them exhibited obvious phenotypes. comparison of the proteomic differences between three of the Î”srna mutants and the wild-type strain by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis  analysis showed that these srnas are involved in multiple physiological and biochemical processes.


CONCLUSIONS
we experimentally verified eight srnas in a genome-wide screen and uncovered three hfq-dependent srnas in xoo. proteomics analysis revealed xoo srnas may take part in various metabolic processes. taken together, this work represents the first comprehensive screen and functional analysis of srnas in rice pathogenic bacteria and facilitates future studies on srna-mediated regulatory networks in this important phytopathogen.
