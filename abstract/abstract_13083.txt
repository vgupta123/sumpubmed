BACKGROUND
although it is known that clavata <dig>  acts as 12- and/or 13-amino acid  secreted peptides to regulate the number of stem cells in shoot apical meristems , how functional clv <dig> peptides are generated and if any particular sequences are required for the processing remain largely unknown.


RESULTS
we developed a mass spectrometry -based in vitro assay to monitor the cleavage of heterologously produced clv <dig> fusion protein. through co-cultivation of the fusion protein with arabidopsis seedlings, we identified two cleavage sites: the previously reported one before arg <dig> and a new one before met <dig>  using synthetic peptides together with maldi-tof-ms analyses, we demonstrated that the non-conserved 5-aa motifs flanking n-termini of the clv <dig> and its orthologous cle <dig> peptides were critical for their cleavages and optimal activities in vitro. we also found that substitutions of leu <dig> by ala in fusion protein and in synthetic peptide of clv <dig> compromised their cleavages, leading to significantly reduced activities in regulating the sizes of shoot and root meristems.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that 5-aa residues flanking the n-terminus of clv <dig> peptide are required for proper cleavages and optimal function in stem cell regulation.
