BACKGROUND
enormous work has shown that polyamines are involved in a variety of physiological processes, but information is scarce on the potential of modifying disease response through genetic transformation of a polyamine biosynthetic gene.


RESULTS
in the present work, an apple spermidine synthase gene  was introduced into sweet orange  via agrobacterium-mediated transformation of embryogenic calluses. two transgenic lines  varied in the transgene expression and cellular endogenous polyamine contents. pinprick inoculation demonstrated that the transgenic lines were less susceptible to xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri , the causal agent of citrus canker, than the wild type plants . in addition, our data showed that upon xac attack tg <dig> had significantly higher free spermine  and polyamine oxidase  activity when compared with the wt, concurrent with an apparent hypersensitive response and the accumulation of more h2o <dig>  pretreatment of tg <dig> leaves with guazatine acetate, an inhibitor of pao, repressed pao activity and reduced h2o <dig> accumulation, leading to more conspicuous disease symptoms than the controls when both were challenged with xac. moreover, mrna levels of most of the defense-related genes involved in synthesis of pathogenesis-related protein and jasmonic acid were upregulated in tg <dig> than in the wt regardless of xac infection.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrated that overexpression of the mdspds <dig> gene prominently lowered the sensitivity of the transgenic plants to canker. this may be, at least partially, correlated with the generation of more h2o <dig> due to increased production of polyamines and enhanced pao-mediated catabolism, triggering hypersensitive response or activation of defense-related genes.
