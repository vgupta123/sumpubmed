BACKGROUND
the master regulator p <dig> tumor-suppressor protein through coordination of several downstream target genes and upstream transcription factors controls many pathways important for tumor suppression. while it has been reported that some of the p53's functions are microrna-mediated, it is not known as to how many other micrornas might contribute to the p53-mediated tumorigenesis.


RESULTS
here, we use bioinformatics-based integrative approach to identify and prioritize putative p53-regulated mirnas, and unravel the mirna-based microregulation of the p <dig> master regulatory network. specifically, we identify putative microrna regulators of a) transcription factors that are upstream or downstream to p <dig> and b) p <dig> interactants. the putative p53-mirs and their targets are prioritized using current knowledge of cancer biology and literature-reported cancer-mirnas.


CONCLUSIONS
our predicted p53-mirna-gene networks strongly suggest that coordinated transcriptional and p53-mir mediated networks could be integral to tumorigenesis and the underlying processes and pathways.
