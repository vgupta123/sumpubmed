BACKGROUND
fishes in the families cichlidae and labridae provide good probable examples of vertebrate adaptive radiations. their spectacular trophic radiations have been widely assumed to be due to structural key innovation in pharyngeal jaw apparatus , but this idea has never been tested based on a reliable phylogeny. for the first step of evaluating the hypothesis, we investigated the phylogenetic positions of the components of the suborder labroidei  within the percomorpha, the most diversified  crown clade of teleosts. we examined those based on  <dig> whole mitochondrial genome sequences  through partitioned bayesian analyses with concatenated sequences .


RESULTS
the resultant phylogenies indicated that the labridae and the remaining three labroid families have diverged basally within the percomorpha, and monophyly of the suborder was confidently rejected by statistical tests using bayes factors.


CONCLUSIONS
the resultant phylogenies indicated that the specified pja evolved independently at least twice, once in labridae and once in the common ancestor of the remaining three labroid families . because the independent evolution of pharyngeal jaws appears to have been followed by trophic radiations, we consider that our result supports, from the aspect of historical repeatability, the idea that the evolution of the specialized pja provided these lineages with the morphological potential for their spectacular trophic radiations. the present result will provide a new framework for the study of functional morphology and genetic basis of their pja.
