BACKGROUND
next-generation sequencing  technologies has brought an unprecedented amount of genomic data for analysis. unlike array-based profiling technologies, ngs can reveal the expression profile across a transcript at the base level. such a base-level read coverage provides further insights for alternative mrna splicing, single-nucleotide polymorphism , novel transcript discovery, etc. however, to our best knowledge, none of existing ngs viewers can timely visualize genome-wide base-level read coverages in an interactive environment.


RESULTS
this study proposes an efficient visualization pipeline and implements a lightweight read coverage viewer, light-rcv, with the proposed pipeline. light-rcv consists of four featured designs on the path from raw ngs data to the final visualized read coverage: i) read coverage construction algorithm, ii) multi-resolution profiles, iii) two-stage architecture and iv) storage format. with these designs, light-rcv achieves a <  <dig> s response time on any scale of genomic ranges, including whole chromosomes. finally, a case study was performed to demonstrate the importance of visualizing base-level read coverage and the value of light-rcv.


CONCLUSIONS
compared with multi-functional genome viewers such as artemis, savant, tablet and integrative genomics viewer , light-rcv is designed only for visualization. therefore, it does not provide advanced analyses. however, its backend technology provides an efficient kernel of base-level visualization that can be easily embedded to other viewers. this viewer is the first to provide timely visualization of genome-wide read coverage at the base level in an interactive environment. the software is available for free at http://lightrcv.ee.ncku.edu.tw.
