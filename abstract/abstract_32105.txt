BACKGROUND
streptomyces sp. n <dig> chitosanase , a member of glycoside hydrolases family  <dig>  is one of the most extensively studied chitosanases. previous studies allowed identifying several key residues of this inverting enzyme, such as the two catalytic carboxylic amino acids as well as residues that are involved in substrate binding. in spite of the progress in understanding the catalytic mechanism of this chitosanase, the function of some residues highly conserved throughout gh <dig> family has not been fully elucidated. this study focuses on one of such residues, the arginine  <dig> 


RESULTS
mutation of arg <dig> into any other amino acid resulted in a drastic loss of enzyme activity. detailed investigations of r42e and r42k chitosanases revealed that the mutant enzymes are not only impaired in their catalytic activity but also in their mode of interaction with the substrate. mutated enzymes were more sensitive to substrate inhibition and were altered in their pattern of activity against chitosans of various degrees of deacetylation. our data show that arg <dig> plays a dual role in csnn <dig> activity.


CONCLUSIONS
arginine  <dig> is essential to maintain the enzymatic function of chitosanase csnn <dig>  we suggest that this arginine is influencing the catalytic nucleophile residue and also the substrate binding mode of the enzyme by optimizing the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged carboxylic residues of the substrate binding cleft and the amino groups of glcn residues in chitosan.
