BACKGROUND
genome-wide association study  is a powerful tool for revealing the genetic basis of quantitative traits. however, studies using gwas for conformation traits of cattle is comparatively less. this study aims to use gwas to find the candidates genes for body conformation traits.


RESULTS
the illumina bovinesnp <dig> beadchip was used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms  that are associated with body conformation traits. a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator  was applied to detect multiple snps simultaneously for  <dig> body conformation traits with  <dig>  chinese holstein cattle and  <dig>  snps. totally,  <dig> genome-wide significant snps associated with  <dig> conformation traits were detected by genome-wide association analysis; five snps were within previously reported qtl regions  database) and  <dig> were very close to the reported snps. twenty-two snps were located within annotated gene regions, while the remainder were  <dig> –826 kb away from known genes. some of the genes had clear biological functions related to conformation traits. by combining information about the previously reported qtl regions and the biological functions of the genes, we identified darc, gas <dig>  mtpn, htr2a, znf <dig>  pdia <dig>  and tmem <dig> as the most promising candidate genes for capacity and body depth, chest width, foot angle, angularity, rear leg side view, teat length, and animal size traits, respectively. we also found four snps that affected four pairs of traits, and the genetic correlation between each pair of traits ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , suggesting that these snps may have a pleiotropic effect on each pair of traits.


CONCLUSIONS
a total of  <dig> significant snps associated with  <dig> conformation traits were identified in the chinese holstein population. six promising candidate genes were suggested, and four snps showed genetic correlation for four pairs of traits.
