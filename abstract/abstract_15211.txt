BACKGROUND
aspergillus terreus causes invasive aspergillosis  in immunocompromised individuals and can be the leading cause of ia in certain medical centers. we examined a large isolate collection  for the presence of cryptic a. terreus species and employed a genome scanning method, inter-simple sequence repeat  pcr to determine a. terreus population structure.


RESULTS
comparative sequence analyses of the calmodulin locus revealed the presence of the recently recognized species a. alabamensis  in this collection. maximum parsimony, neighbor joining, and bayesian clustering of the issr data from the  <dig> sequence-confirmed a. terreus isolates demonstrated that one clade was composed exclusively of isolates from europe and another clade was enriched for isolates from the us.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides evidence of a population structure linked to geographical origin in a. terreus.
