BACKGROUND
micrornas  are important regulators of gene expression and have been implicated in development, differentiation and pathogenesis. hundreds of mirnas have been discovered in mammalian genomes. approximately 50% of mammalian mirnas are expressed from introns of protein-coding genes; the primary transcript  is therefore assumed to be the host transcript. however, very little is known about the structure of pri-mirnas expressed from intergenic regions. here we annotate transcript boundaries of mirnas in human, mouse and rat genomes using various transcription features. the 5' end of the pri-mirna is predicted from transcription start sites, cpg islands and 5' cage tags mapped in the upstream flanking region surrounding the precursor mirna . the 3' end of the pri-mirna is predicted based on the mapping of polya signals, and supported by cdna/est and ditags data. the predicted pri-mirnas are also analyzed for promoter and insulator-associated regulatory regions.


RESULTS
we define sets of conserved and non-conserved human, mouse and rat pre-mirnas using bidirectional blast and synteny analysis. transcription features in their flanking regions are used to demarcate the 5' and 3' boundaries of the pri-mirnas. the lengths and boundaries of primary transcripts are highly conserved between orthologous mirnas. a significant fraction of pri-mirnas have lengths between  <dig> and  <dig> kb, with very few introns. we annotate a total of  <dig> pri-mirna structures, which include  <dig> pre-mirnas.  <dig> pri-mirnas are conserved in all  <dig> species. in total,  <dig> of the confidently annotated transcripts express more than one pre-mirna. the upstream regions of 54% of the predicted pri-mirnas are found to be associated with promoter and insulator regulatory sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
little is known about the primary transcripts of intergenic mirnas. using comparative data, we are able to identify the boundaries of a significant proportion of human, mouse and rat pri-mirnas. we confidently predict the transcripts including a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> human, mouse and rat pre-mirnas respectively. our computational annotations provide a basis for subsequent experimental validation of predicted pri-mirnas.
