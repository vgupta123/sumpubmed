BACKGROUND
online mendelian inheritance in man  is a computerized database of information about genes and heritable traits in human populations, based on information reported in the scientific literature. our objective was to establish an automated text-mining system for omim that will identify genetically-related cancers and cancer-related genes. we developed the computer program cgmim to search for entries in omim that are related to one or more cancer types. we performed manual searches of omim to verify the program results.


RESULTS
in the omim database on september  <dig>   <dig>  cgmim identified  <dig> genes related to cancer. brca <dig> , braf  and cdkn2a  were each related to  <dig> types of cancer. there were  <dig> genes related to cancer of the esophagus,  <dig> genes related to cancer of the stomach, and  <dig> genes related to both. analysis of cgmim results indicate that fewer than three gene entries in omim should mention both, and the more than seven-fold discrepancy suggests cancers of the esophagus and stomach are more genetically related than current literature suggests.


CONCLUSIONS
cgmim identifies genetically-related cancers and cancer-related genes. in several ways, cancers with shared genetic etiology are anticipated to lead to further etiologic hypotheses and advances regarding environmental agents. cgmim results are posted monthly and the source code can be obtained free of charge from the bc cancer research centre website .
