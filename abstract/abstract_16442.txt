BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium produces surface-associated fimbriae that facilitate adherence of the bacteria to a variety of cells and tissues. type  <dig> fimbriae with binding specificity to mannose residues are the most commonly found fimbrial type. in vitro, static-broth culture favors the growth of s. typhimurium with type  <dig> fimbriae, whereas non-type  <dig> fimbriate bacteria are obtained by culture on solid-agar media. previous studies demonstrated that the phenotypic expression of type  <dig> fimbriae is the result of the interaction and cooperation of the regulatory genes fimz, fimy, fimw, and fimu within the fim gene cluster. genome sequencing revealed a novel gene, stm <dig>  located between fimy and fimw that encodes an  <dig> -kda putative phosphodiesterase specific for the bacterial second messenger cyclic-diguanylate monophosphate . the role of stm <dig> in the regulation of type  <dig> fimbriae in s. typhimurium remains unclear.


RESULTS
a stm0551-deleted stain constructed by allelic exchange constitutively produced type  <dig> fimbriae in both static-broth and solid-agar medium conditions. quantative rt-pcr revealed that expression of the fimbrial major subunit gene, fima, and one of the regulatory genes, fimz, were comparably increased in the stm0551-deleted strain compared with those of the parental strain when grown on the solid-agar medium, a condition that normally inhibits expression of type  <dig> fimbriae. following transformation with a plasmid possessing the coding sequence of stm <dig>  expression of fima and fimz decreased in the stm <dig> mutant strain in both culture conditions, whereas transformation with the control vector pacyc <dig> relieved this repression. a purified stm <dig> protein exhibited a phosphodiesterase activity in vitro while a point mutation in the putative eal domain, substituting glutamic acid  with alanine , of stm <dig> or a fimy protein abolished this activity.


CONCLUSIONS
the finding that the stm <dig> gene plays a negative regulatory role in the regulation of type  <dig> fimbriae in s. typhimurium has not been reported previously. the possibility that degradation of c-di-gmp is a key step in the regulation of type  <dig> fimbriae warrants further investigation.
