BACKGROUND
transgenic mice have been used to examine the role of heat shock protein  <dig> in experimental heatstroke. transgenic mice that were heterozygous for a porcine hsp70β gene  and transgene-negative littermate controls , under pentobarbital sodium anesthesia, were subjected to heat stress to induce heatstroke. it was found that the overexpression of hsp <dig> in multiple organs improved survival during heatstroke by reducing hypotension and cerebral ischemia and damage in mice. herein we attempted to further assess the effect of heat exposure on thermoregulatory function, hypothalamic integration, and survival in unrestrained, unanesthetized hsp <dig> and compare with those of hsp <dig>  in this research with the transgenic mice, we first conducted several biochemical, physiologic and histological determinations and then investigated the beneficial effects of hsp <dig> overexpression on the identified hypothalamic deficits, thermoregulatory dysfunction, and mortality during heatstroke.


RESULTS
we report here that when hsp <dig> mice underwent heat stress , the fraction survival and core temperature at  <dig> h after heat stress were found to be  <dig> of  <dig> and  <dig> °c ±  <dig> °c, respectively. mice that survived to day  <dig> after heat stress were considered as survivors. in hsp <dig> mice, when exposed to the same heat treatment, both fraction survival and core temperature values were significantly increased to new values of 12/ <dig> and  <dig> °c ±  <dig> °c, respectively. compared to hsp mice, hsp <dig> mice displayed lower hypothalamic values of cellular ischemia  and damage  markers, pro-oxidant enzymes , pro-inflammatory cytokines , and neuronal damage score evaluated  <dig> h after heat stress. in contrast, hsp <dig> mice had higher hypothalamic values of antioxidant defences , atp, and hsp <dig> expression.


CONCLUSIONS
this study indicates that hsp <dig> overexpression appears to be critical to the development of thermotolerance and protection from heat-induced hypothalamic ischemic and oxidative damage.
