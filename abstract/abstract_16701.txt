BACKGROUND
the tata-box and tata-variants are regulatory elements involved in the formation of a transcription initiation complex. both have been conserved throughout evolution in a restricted region close to the transcription start site . however, less than half of the genes in model organisms studied so far have been found to contain either one of these elements. indeed different core-promoter elements are involved in the recruitment of the tata-box-binding protein. here we assessed the possibility of identifying novel functional motifs in plant genes, sharing the tata-box topological constraints.


RESULTS
we developed an ab-initio approach considering the preferential location of motifs relative to the tss. we identified motifs observed at the tata-box expected location and conserved in both arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa promoters. we identified tc-elements within non-ta-rich promoters  <dig> bases upstream of the tss. as with the tata-box and tata-variant sequences, it was possible to construct a unique distance graph with the tc-element sequences. the structural and functional features of tc-element-containing genes were distinct from those of tata-box- or tata-variant-containing genes. arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome analysis revealed that tata-box-containing genes were generally those showing relatively high levels of expression and that tc-element-containing genes were generally those expressed in specific conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
our observations suggest that the tc-elements might constitute a class of novel regulatory elements participating towards the complex modulation of gene expression in plants.
