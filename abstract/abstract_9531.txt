BACKGROUND
pmp <dig>  a member of the junction protein family claudin/emp/pmp <dig>  plays an important role in myelin formation. increase of pmp <dig> transcription causes peripheral neuropathy, charcot-marie-tooth disease type1a . the pathophysiological phenotype of cmt1a is aberrant axonal myelination which induces a reduction in nerve conduction velocity . several cmt1a model rodents have been established by overexpressing pmp <dig>  thus, it is thought that pmp <dig> expression must be tightly regulated for correct myelin formation in mammals. interestingly, the myelin sheath is also present in other jawed vertebrates. the purpose of this study is to analyze the evolutionary conservation of the association between pmp <dig> transcription level and vertebrate myelin formation, and to find the conserved non-coding sequences for pmp <dig> regulation by comparative genomics analyses between jawed fishes and mammals.


RESULTS
a transgenic pmp <dig> over-expression medaka fish line was established. the transgenic fish had approximately one fifth the peripheral ncv values of controls, and aberrant myelination of transgenic fish in the peripheral nerve system  was observed. we successfully confirmed that medaka fish pmp <dig> has the same exon-intron structure as mammals, and identified some known conserved regulatory motifs. furthermore, we found novel conserved sequences in the first intron and 3'utr.


CONCLUSIONS
medaka fish undergo abnormalities in the pns when pmp <dig> transcription increases. this result indicates that an adequate pmp <dig> transcription level is necessary for correct myelination of jawed vertebrates. comparison of pmp <dig> orthologs between distantly related species identifies evolutionary conserved sequences that contribute to precise regulation of pmp <dig> expression.
