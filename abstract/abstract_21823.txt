BACKGROUND
fish reared under intensive conditions are repeatedly exposed to stress, which negatively impacts growth. although most fish follow a conserved pattern of stress response, with increased concentrations of cortisol, each species presents specificities in the cell response and stress tolerance. therefore, culturing new species requires a detailed knowledge of these specific responses. the red cusk-eel  is a new economically important marine species for the chilean aquaculture industry. however, there is no information on the stress- and cortisol-induced mechanisms that decrease skeletal muscle growth in this teleost.


RESULTS
using illumina rna-seq technology, skeletal muscle sequence reads for g. chilensis were generated under control and handling stress conditions. reads were mapped onto a reference transcriptome, resulting in the in silico identification of  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated transcripts. gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed a significant up-regulation of catabolic genes associated with skeletal muscle atrophy. these results were validated by rt-qpcr analysis for ten candidates genes involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, autophagy and skeletal muscle growth. additionally, using a primary culture of fish skeletal muscle cells, the effect of cortisol was evaluated in relation to red cusk-eel skeletal muscle atrophy.


CONCLUSIONS
the present data demonstrated that handling stress promotes skeletal muscle atrophy in the marine teleost g. chilensis through the expression of components of the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome systems. furthermore, cortisol was a powerful inductor of skeletal muscle atrophy in fish myotubes. this study is an important step towards understanding the atrophy system in non-model teleost species and provides novel insights on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control skeletal muscle growth in early vertebrates.
