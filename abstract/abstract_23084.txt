BACKGROUND
rainbow trout  are cultivated worldwide for aquaculture production and are widely used as a model species to gain knowledge of many aspects of fish biology. the common ancestor of the salmonids experienced a whole genome duplication event, making extant salmonids such as the rainbow trout an excellent model for studying the evolution of tetraploidization and re-diploidization in vertebrates. however, the lack of a reference genome sequence hampers research progress for both academic and applied purposes. in order to enrich the genomic tools already available in this species and provide further insight on the complexity of its genome, we sequenced a large number of rainbow trout bac-end sequences  and characterized their contents.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  high quality bes, were generated, representing approximately 4% of the trout genome. bes analyses identified  <dig>  simple sequence repeats , of which  <dig>  had high quality flanking sequences for pcr primers design. the first rainbow trout repeat elements database  containing  <dig> putative repeat elements was developed, and identified almost  <dig> % of the bes database in base-pairs as repetitive sequence. approximately 55% of the bes reads  had more than  <dig> base pairs of contiguous non-repetitive sequences. the fractions of the  <dig>  non-repetitive trout bes reads that had significant blastn hits against the zebrafish, medaka and stickleback genome databases were 15%,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, while the fractions of the non-repetitive bes reads that had significant blastx hits against the zebrafish, medaka, and stickleback protein databases were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. comparative genomics using paired bac-ends revealed several regions of conserved synteny across all the fish species analyzed in this study.


CONCLUSIONS
the characterization of bes provided insights on the rainbow trout genome. the discovery of specific repeat elements will facilitate analyses of sequence content  and future genome sequence assemblies. the numerous microsatellites will facilitate integration of the linkage and physical maps and serve as valuable resource for fine mapping qtl and positional cloning of genes affecting aquaculture production traits. furthermore, comparative genomics through bes can be used for identifying positional candidate genes from qtl mapping studies, aid in future assembly of a reference genome sequence and elucidating sequence content and complexity in the rainbow trout genome.
