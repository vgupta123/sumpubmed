BACKGROUND
secretoglobin  3a <dig> is a secretory protein of small molecular weight with tumor suppressor function. it is highly expressed in lung and trachea in both human and mouse, with additional tissues expressing the protein that differ depending on the species. however, little is known about the function and transcriptional regulation of this gene in normal mouse tissues.


RESULTS
by reporter gene transfection and gel mobility shift analyses, we demonstrated that expression of the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene is regulated by a pu-box binding protein and a ubiquitous transcription factor nf-y that respectively binds to the pu-boxes located at - <dig> to - <dig> bp and - <dig> to - <dig> bp, and the "ccaat" binding sites located at - <dig> to - <dig> bp and - <dig> to - <dig> bp from the transcription start site of the gene. however, the effect of pu-box binding protein on transcriptional activation is minimal as compared to nf-y, suggesting that nf-y is a more critical transcription factor for mouse scgb3a <dig> gene transcription. despite that nf-y is a ubiquitous factor, scgb3a <dig> is highly expressed only in mouse lung and mtcc cells that are derived from sv <dig> transformed mouse clara cells, but not in ten other mouse tissues/cells examined. gene methylation analysis revealed that within  <dig> bp of the scgb3a <dig> gene promoter region, there are nine cpg methylation sites present, of which two cpgs closest to the transcription start site of the gene are unmethylated in the tissues/cells expressing scgb3a <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
a ubiquitous transcription factor nf-y binds to and activates expression of the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene and tissue-specific expression of the gene is associated with cpg methylation of the promoter.
