BACKGROUND
histone deacetylase  proteins are associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and cancer. specifically, hdac <dig> is linked with cell growth, a hallmark of cancer formation. hdac <dig> is a phosphoprotein and phosphorylation at s <dig> and s <dig> promotes hdac <dig> enzymatic activity and protein association. while single and double point mutants of hdac <dig> at s <dig> and s <dig> appear functionally similar, the evidence suggests that hdac <dig> is phosphorylated simultaneously at both s <dig> and s <dig> in vivo. additional experiments are necessary to probe the role of double phosphorylation of hdac <dig> at s <dig> and s <dig> 


RESULTS
to characterize hdac <dig> phosphorylation at s <dig> and s <dig>  limited proteolysis of hdac <dig> was performed for the first time. hdac <dig> degraded without production of discrete fragments. by performing concentration-dependent proteolysis, hdac <dig> double point mutants with disrupted phosphorylation at s <dig> and s <dig> displayed different trypsin sensitivities compared to wild type hdac <dig>  unexpectedly, hdac <dig> single point mutants with disrupted phosphorylation at either s <dig> or s <dig> demonstrated protease sensitivity similar to the wild type hdac <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
concentration-dependent proteolysis experiments provide evidence that phosphorylation of s <dig> and s <dig> individually contribute to hdac <dig> function. in addition, the limited proteolysis experiments support a model where associated proteins promote hdac <dig> enzymatic activity, reinforcing the importance of protein interactions in hdac <dig> structure and function. finally, because hdac <dig> does not display distinct regions of protease sensitivity, the proteolysis studies suggest that hdac <dig> comprises inter-related structural regions.
