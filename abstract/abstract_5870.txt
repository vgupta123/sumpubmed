BACKGROUND
immunosuppression by gliomas contributes to tumor progression and treatment resistance. it is not known when immunosuppression occurs during tumor development but it likely involves cross-talk among tumor cells, tumor-associated macrophages and microglia , and peripheral as well as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes .


RESULTS
we have performed a kinetic study of this immunomodulation, assessing the dynamics of immune infiltration and function, within the central nervous system  and peripherally. pdgf-driven murine glioma cells were injected into the white matter of  <dig> mice. four mice were sacrificed  <dig> days post-injection , four mice at  <dig> dpi, and five mice at  <dig> dpi. using multiparameter flow cytometry, splenic t cells were assessed for foxp <dig> expression to identify regulatory t cells  and production of ifn-γ and il- <dig> after stimulation with pma/ionomycin; within the cns, cd4+ tils were quantified, and tams were quantified and assessed for tnf-α and il- <dig> production after stimulation with lps. peripheral changes associated with tumor development were noted prior to effects within the cns. the percentage of foxp3+ regulatory t cells  increased by day  <dig>  with elevated frequencies throughout the duration of the study. this early increase in tregs was paralleled by an increase in il- <dig> production from tregs. at the final time points examined , there was an increase in the frequency of tams with decreased capacity to secrete tnf-α. an increase in til frequency was also observed at these final time points.


CONCLUSIONS
these data provide insight into the kinetics of the immunosuppressive state associated with tumor growth in a murine model of human gliomas. functional impairment of tams occurs relatively late in the course of gbm tumor growth, potentially providing a window of opportunity for therapeutic strategies directed towards preventing their functional impairment.
