BACKGROUND
as in many other areas of science, systems biology makes extensive use of statistical association and significance estimates in contingency tables, a type of categorical data analysis known in this field as enrichment  analysis. in spite of efforts to create probabilistic annotations, especially in the gene ontology context, or to deal with uncertainty in high throughput-based datasets, current enrichment methods largely ignore this probabilistic information since they are mainly based on variants of the fisher exact test.


RESULTS
we developed an open-source r-based software to deal with probabilistic categorical data analysis, probcd, that does not require a static contingency table. the contingency table for the enrichment problem is built using the expectation of a bernoulli scheme stochastic process given the categorization probabilities. an on-line interface was created to allow usage by non-programmers and is available at: .


CONCLUSIONS
we present an analysis framework and software tools to address the issue of uncertainty in categorical data analysis. in particular, concerning the enrichment analysis, probcd can accommodate:  the stochastic nature of the high-throughput experimental techniques and  probabilistic gene annotation.
