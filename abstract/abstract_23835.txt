BACKGROUND
keratins make up the largest subgroup of intermediate filaments, and, in chordates, represent the most abundant proteins in epithelial cells. they have been associated with a wide range of functions in the cell, but little information is still available about their expression profile and regulation during flatfish metamorphosis. senegalese sole  is a commercially important flatfish in which no keratin gene has been described yet.


RESULTS
the development of large-scale genomics of senegalese sole has facilitated the identification of two different type i keratin genes referred to as sseker <dig> and sseker <dig>  main characteristics and sequence identities with other fish and mammal keratins are described. phylogenetic analyses grouped sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> in a significant clade with other teleost epidermal type i keratins, and have allowed for the identification of sseker <dig> as a novel keratin. the expression profile of both genes was studied during larval development and in tissues using a real-time approach. sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> mrna levels were significantly higher in skin than in other tissues examined. during metamorphosis, sseker <dig> transcripts increased significantly at first stages, and reduced thereafter. in contrast, sseker <dig> mrna levels did not change during early metamorphosis although a significant drop at metamorphosis climax and late metamorphosis was also detected. to study the possible regulation of sseker gene expressions by thyroid hormones , larvae were exposed to the goitrogen thiourea . tu-treated larvae exhibited higher sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> mrna levels than untreated control at both  <dig> and  <dig> days after treatment. moreover, addition of exogenous t <dig> hormone to tu-treated larvae restored or even reduced the steady-state levels with respect to the untreated control, demonstrating that expression of both genes is negatively regulated by ths.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified two keratin genes, referred to as sseker <dig> and sseker <dig>  in senegalese sole. phylogenetic analyses revealed sseker <dig> as a novel keratin. although they exhibit different expression patterns during larval development, both of them are negatively regulated by ths. the co-regulation by ths could explain the reduction of both keratin transcripts after the metamorphosis climax, suggesting their role in the tissue remodelling processes that occur during metamorphosis.
