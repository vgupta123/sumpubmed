BACKGROUND
pheromone binding proteins  of male lepidoptera function in chemical communication, mate attraction and recognition. directional selection was previously predicted between pbp <dig> orthologs of ostrinia furnacalis and ostrinia nubilalis were interpreted as being involved in sexual isolation.


RESULTS
in vitro assays show that recombinant male ofurpbp <dig> bound o. furnacalis sex pheromones, z-12-tetradecenyl acetate  and e-12-tetradecenyl acetate , as well as to ecb pheromones z11- and e11-14:oac. recombinant ofurpbp <dig> and ofurpbp <dig> bound e11- and z11-14:oac with greater affinity compared to z12- and e12-14:oac, and ofurpbp <dig> incapable of binding with e12-14:oac. in silico molecular docking predicted ofurpbp <dig> residues phe <dig>  ile <dig>  leu <dig>  ile <dig> within a hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket and may participate in e12- and z12-14:oac binding. independent site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that ser <dig>  asn <dig>  arg <dig>  and asn <dig> residues variants caused an approximately  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold reduction in ofurpbp <dig> affinity for z12- and e12-14:oac, and a  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold decrease in affinity towards e11- and z11-14:oac.


CONCLUSIONS
five pbps of o. furnacalis play important functions in ostrinia pheromones binding. these four amino acids may play a role in binding of sex pheromone, but this study does not address questions regarding specific response between males of o. furnacalis and o. nubilalis. additional studies are required determine the role, if any, pbps play in the evolution of sex pheromone communication.
