BACKGROUND
with the rapid accumulation of phosphoproteomics data, phosphorylation-site prediction is becoming an increasingly active research area. more than a dozen phosphorylation-site prediction tools have been released in the past decade. however, there is currently no open-source framework specifically designed for phosphorylation-site prediction except musite.


RESULTS
here we present the musite open-source framework for building applications to perform machine learning based phosphorylation-site prediction. musite was implemented with six modules loosely coupled with each other. with its well-designed java application programming interface , musite can be easily extended to integrate various sources of biological evidence for phosphorylation-site prediction.


CONCLUSIONS
released under the gnu gpl open source license, musite provides an open and extensible framework for phosphorylation-site prediction. the software with its source code is available at http://musite.sourceforge.net.
