BACKGROUND
hepatitis b virus  infection increases the risk of liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. small interfering rna  can be a potential new tool for hbv therapy. given the high heterogeneity of hbv strains and the sensitivity towards sequences changes of sirna, finding a potent sirna inhibitor against the conservative site on the hbv genome is essential to ensure a therapeutic application.


RESULTS
forty short hairpin rna  expression plasmids were constructed to target conserved regions among nine hbv genotypes. hbv  <dig> -fold genome plasmids carrying various genotypes were co-transfected with shrna plasmids into either huh <dig> cells or mice. the levels of various viral markers were examined to assess the anti-hbv efficacy of sirna. four  were found with the ability to potently inhibit hbv rna, dna, surface antigen , e antigen  and core antigen  expression in hbv genotypes a, b, c, d and i  in huh <dig> cells and in mice. no unusual cytotoxicity or off-target effects were noted.


CONCLUSIONS
such sirna suggests an alternate way of inhibiting various hbv genotypes in vitro and in vivo, promising advances in the treatment of hbv.
