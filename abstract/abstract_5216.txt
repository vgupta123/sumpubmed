BACKGROUND
american ginseng  is one of the most widely used herbal remedies in the world. its major bioactive constituents are the triterpene saponins known as ginsenosides. however, little is known about ginsenoside biosynthesis in american ginseng, especially the late steps of the pathway.


RESULTS
in this study, a one-quarter  <dig> sequencing run produced  <dig>  high-quality reads with an average sequence length of  <dig> bases. de novo assembly generated  <dig>  unique sequences containing  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. about  <dig> % of the high-quality reads were assembled into contigs with an average 8-fold coverage. a total of  <dig>   unique sequences were annotated by a blast similarity search against four public sequence databases, and  <dig>  of the unique sequences were assigned to specific metabolic pathways by the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes. based on the bioinformatic analysis described above, we found all of the known enzymes involved in ginsenoside backbone synthesis, starting from acetyl-coa via the isoprenoid pathway. additionally, a total of  <dig> cytochrome p <dig>  and  <dig> glycosyltransferase unique sequences were found in the  <dig> cdna library, some of which encode enzymes responsible for the conversion of the ginsenoside backbone into the various ginsenosides. finally, one cyp <dig> and four udp-glycosyltransferases were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis through a methyl jasmonate  inducibility experiment and tissue-specific expression pattern analysis based on a real-time pcr assay.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated, with the assistance of the meja inducibility experiment and tissue-specific expression pattern analysis, that transcriptome analysis based on  <dig> pyrosequencing is a powerful tool for determining the genes encoding enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in non-model plants. additionally, the expressed sequence tags  and unique sequences from this study provide an important resource for the scientific community that is interested in the molecular genetics and functional genomics of american ginseng.
