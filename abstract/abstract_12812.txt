BACKGROUND
ribosomal protein l <dig> belongs to the l7ae family of rna-binding proteins, which recognize diverse targets. l <dig> binds to kink-turn motifs in the 28s ribosomal rna, l <dig> pre-mrna, and mature l <dig> mrna. l <dig> has a noncanonical function as a component of the uga recoding machinery that incorporates selenocysteine  into selenoproteins during translation. l <dig> binds to a putative kink-turn motif in the sec insertion sequence  element in the 3’ utr of mammalian selenoprotein mrnas. the secis also interacts with secis-binding protein  <dig> , an essential factor for sec incorporation. previous studies showed that l <dig> and sbp <dig> compete for binding to the secis in vitro. the sbp2:secis interaction has been characterized but much less is known about how l <dig> recognizes the secis.


RESULTS
here we use enzymatic rna footprinting to define the l <dig> binding site on the secis. like sbp <dig>  l <dig> protects nucleotides in the 5’ side of the internal loop, the 5’ side of the lower helix, and the secis core, including the ga tandem base pairs that are predicted to form a kink-turn. however, l <dig> has additional determinants for binding as it also protects nucleotides in the 3’ side of the internal loop, which are not protected by sbp <dig>  in support of the competitive binding model, we found that purified l <dig> repressed uga recoding in an in vitro translation system, and that this inhibition was rescued by sbp <dig>  to define the amino acid requirements for secis-binding, site-specific mutations in l <dig> were generated based on published structural studies of this protein in a complex with its canonical target, the l <dig> pre-mrna. we identified point mutations that selectively inhibited binding of l <dig> to the secis, to the l <dig> pre-mrna, or both rnas, suggesting that there are subtle differences in how l <dig> interacts with the two targets.


CONCLUSIONS
this study establishes that l <dig> and sbp <dig> bind to overlapping but non-identical sites on the secis. the amino acid requirements for the interaction of l <dig> with the secis differ from those that mediate binding to the l <dig> pre-mrna. our results provide insight into how l7ae family members recognize their cognate rnas.
