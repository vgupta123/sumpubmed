BACKGROUND
whole-genome sequencing represents a powerful experimental tool for pathogen research. we present methods for the analysis of small eukaryotic genomes, including a streamlined system  for finding single nucleotide and copy number variants as well as recombination events.


RESULTS
we have validated our pipeline using four sets of plasmodium falciparum drug resistant data containing  <dig> clones from 3d <dig> and dd <dig> background strains, identifying an average of  <dig> single nucleotide variants per clone. we also identify  <dig> copy number variants with contributions to resistance, and report for the first time that all analyzed amplification events are in tandem.


CONCLUSIONS
the platypus pipeline provides malaria researchers with a powerful tool to analyze short read sequencing data. it provides an accurate way to detect snvs using known software packages, and a novel methodology for detection of cnvs, though it does not currently support detection of small indels. we have validated that the pipeline detects known snvs in a variety of samples while filtering out spurious data. we bundle the methods into a freely available package.
