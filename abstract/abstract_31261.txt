BACKGROUND
probiotic bacteria are thought to play an important role in the digestive system and therefore have to survive the passage from stomach to intestines. recently, a novel approach to simulate the passage from stomach to intestines in a single bioreactor was developed. the advantage of this automated one reactor system was the ability to test the influence of acid, bile salts and pancreatin.

lactobacillus gasseri k <dig> is a strain isolated from infant faeces with properties making the strain interesting for cheese production. in this study, a single reactor system was used to evaluate the survival of l. gasseri k <dig> and selected bifidobacteria from our collection through the stomach-intestine passage.


RESULTS
initial screening for acid resistance in acidified culture media showed a low tolerance of bifidobacterium dentium for this condition indicating low survival in the passage. similar results were achieved with b. longum subsp. infantis whereas b. animalis subsp. lactis had a high survival.

these initial results were confirmed in the bioreactor model of the stomach-intestine passage. b. animalis subsp. lactis had the highest survival rate  attaining approximately  <dig> Ã—  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> compared to the other tested bifidobacteria strains which were reduced by a factor of up to  <dig>  lactobacillus gasseri k <dig> was less resistant than b. animalis subsp. lactis but survived at cell concentrations approximately  <dig> times higher than other bifidobacteria.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we were able to show that l. gasseri k <dig> had a high survival rate in the stomach-intestine passage. by comparing the results with a previous study in piglets we could confirm the reliability of our simulation. of the tested bifidobacteria strains, only b. animalis subsp. lactis showed acceptable survival for a successful passage in the simulation system.
