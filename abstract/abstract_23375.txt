BACKGROUND
deletion or mutation of the survival motor neuron  <dig>  gene causes spinal muscular atrophy . the smn protein is known to play a role in rna metabolism, neurite outgrowth, and cell survival. yet, it remains unclear how smn deficiency causes selective motor neuron death and muscle atrophy seen in sma. previously, we have shown that skin fibroblasts from sma patients are more sensitive to the dna topoisomerase i inhibitor camptothecin, supporting a role for smn in cell survival. here, we examine the potential mechanism of camptothecin sensitivity in sma fibroblasts.


RESULTS
camptothecin treatment reduced the dna relaxation activity of dna topoisomerase i in human fibroblasts. in contrast, kinase activity of dna topoisomerase i was not affected by camptothecin, because levels of phosphorylated sr proteins were not decreased. upon camptothecin treatment, levels of p <dig> were markedly increased. to determine if p <dig> plays a role in the increased sensitivity of sma fibroblasts to camptothecin, we analyzed the sensitivity of sma fibroblasts to another dna topoisomerase i inhibitor, β-lapachone. this compound is known to induce death via a p53-independent pathway in several cancer cell lines. we found that β-lapachone did not induce p <dig> activation in human fibroblasts. in addition, sma and control fibroblasts showed essentially identical sensitivity to this compound. by immunofluorescence staining, smn and p <dig> co-localized in gems within the nucleus, and this co-localization was overall reduced in sma fibroblasts. however, depletion of p <dig> by sirna did not lessen the camptothecin sensitivity in sma fibroblasts.


CONCLUSIONS
even though p <dig> and smn are associated, the increased sensitivity of sma fibroblasts to camptothecin does not occur through a p53-dependent mechanism.
