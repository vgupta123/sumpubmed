BACKGROUND
the chicken genome contains a bbp-a gene showing similar characteristics to avidin family genes. in a previous study we reported that the bbp-a gene may encode a biotin-binding protein due to the high sequence similarity with chicken avidin, especially at regions encoding residues known to be located at the ligand-binding site of avidin.


RESULTS
here, we expand the repertoire of known macromolecular biotin binders by reporting a novel biotin-binding protein a  from chicken. the bbp-a recombinant protein was expressed using two different expression systems and purified with affinity chromatography, biochemically characterized and two x-ray structures were solved – in complex with d-biotin  and in complex with d-biotin d-sulfoxide . the bbp-a protein binds free biotin with high, "streptavidin-like" affinity , which is about  <dig> times lower than that of chicken avidin. surprisingly, the affinity of bbp-a for bso is even higher than the affinity for btn. furthermore, the solved structures of the bbp-a – btn and bbp-a – bso complexes, which share the fold with the members of the avidin and lipocalin protein families, are extremely similar to each other.


CONCLUSIONS
bbp-a is an avidin-like protein having a β-barrel fold and high affinity towards btn. however, bbp-a differs from the other known members of the avidin protein family in thermal stability and immunological properties. bbp-a also has a unique ligand-binding property, the ability to bind btn and bso at comparable affinities. bbp-a may have use as a novel material in, e.g. modern biotechnological applications.
