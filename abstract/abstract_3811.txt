BACKGROUND
brucellosis is a severe zoonotic disease worldwide. detection and identification of brucella species are essential to prevent or treat brucellosis in humans and animals. the outer membrane protein- <dig>  is a major protein of brucellae except for b. abortus, while the omp <dig> antigenic epitopes have not been extensively characterized yet.



RESULTS
a total of  <dig> monoclonal antibodies  were produced against omp <dig> of brucella  melitensis, of which  <dig> recognized five linear epitopes,  <dig> reacted with semi-conformational epitopes and  <dig> reacted with conformational epitopes, respectively. the mab isotypes were  <dig>  igg2a,  <dig>  igg <dig> and  <dig>  igm. on the basis of epitope recognition and reactivity levels,  <dig> mabs including  <dig> igm and  <dig> igg clones were considered as highly reactive and potentially diagnostic antibodies. among these mabs, 7a <dig> , 5b <dig> , 2c <dig>  and 5b <dig>  reacted with differently conserved linear epitopes of b. melitensis, b. ovis, b. suis and b. canis strains, while 5h <dig>  highly reacted with a conformational epitope of omp <dig> when tested with several immunoassays.


CONCLUSIONS
these potent monoclonal antibodies can be used for identifying omp <dig> antigens or detecting b. melitensis and other brucella species beyond b. abortus in vitro or in vivo.
