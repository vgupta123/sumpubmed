BACKGROUND
calicheamicins  are enedyine natural products with potent antibiotic and cytotoxic activity, used in anticancer therapy. the o-methyltransferase calo <dig> is proposed to catalyze methylation of the hydroxyl moiety at the c <dig> position of the orsellinic acid group of cal.


RESULTS
crystals of calo <dig> diffracted non-isotropically, with the usable data extending to  <dig>  Å. while no single method of crystal structure determination yielded a structure of calo <dig>  we were able to determine its structure by using molecular replacement-guided single wavelength anomalous dispersion by using diffraction data from native crystals of calo <dig> and a highly non-isomorphous mercury derivative. the structure of calo <dig> reveals the methyltransferase fold and dimeric organization characteristic of small molecule o-methyltransferases involved in secondary metabolism in bacteria and plants. uncommonly, calo <dig> was crystallized in the absence of s-adenosylmethionine  or s-adenosylhomocysteine .


CONCLUSIONS
likely as a consequence of the dynamic nature of calo <dig> in the absence of its cofactor, the central region of calo <dig>  which forms a helical lid-like structure near the active site in calo <dig> and similar enzymes, is not observed in the electron density. we propose that this region controls the entry of sam into and the exit of sah from the active site of calo <dig> and shapes the active site for substrate binding and catalysis.
