BACKGROUND
ionizing radiation in low doses is the ubiquitous environmental factor with harmful stochastic effects. formaldehyde is one of the most reactive household and industrial pollutants. dioxins are persistent organic pollutants and most potent synthetic poisons effective even at trace concentrations. environmental pollutants are capable of altering the expression of a variety of genes. to identify the similarities and differences in the effects of low-dose ionizing radiation, formaldehyde and dioxin on gene expression, we performed the bioinformatic analysis of all available published data.


RESULTS
we found that that in addition to the common p53-, atm- and mapk-signaling stress response pathways, genes of cell cycle regulation and proinflammatory cytokines, the studied pollutants induce a variety of other molecular processes.


CONCLUSIONS
the observed patterns provide new insights into the mechanisms of the adverse effects associated with these pollutants. they can also be useful in the development of new bio-sensing methods for detection of pollutants in the environment and combating the deleterious effects.
