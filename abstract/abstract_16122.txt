BACKGROUND
there are few studies that have examined the potential of rna inference  to increase protein production in the baculovirus expression vector system . spodoptera frugiperda  -caspase-1-repressed stable cells exhibit resistance to apoptosis and enhancement of recombinant protein production. however, the mechanism of recombinant protein augmentation in baculovirus-infected caspase-repressed insect cells has not been elucidated.


RESULTS
in the current study, we utilized rnai-mediated sf-caspase-1-repressed stable cells to clarify how the resistance to apoptosis can enhance both intracellular  and extracellular  recombinant protein production in bevs. since the expression of molecular chaperones is strongly associated with the maximal production of exogenous proteins in bevs, the differential expression of molecular chaperones in baculovirus-infected stable cells was also analyzed in this study.


CONCLUSIONS
the data indicated that the retention of expression of molecular chaperones in baculovirus-infected sf-caspase-1-repressed stable cells give the higher recombinant protein accumulation.
