BACKGROUND
the oral pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis has been shown to modulate apoptosis in different cell types, but its effect on epithelial cells remains unclear.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that primary human gingival epithelial cells  challenged with live p. gingivalis for  <dig> hours exhibit apoptosis, and we characterize this by m <dig> epitope detection, caspase- <dig> activity, dna fragmentation and annexin-v staining. live bacteria strongly upregulated intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. pro-apoptotic molecules such as caspase- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  bid and bax were upregulated after  <dig> hours. the anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> was also upregulated, but this was not sufficient to ensure cell survival. the main p. gingivalis proteases arginine and lysine gingipains are necessary and sufficient to induce host cell apoptosis. thus, live p. gingivalis can invoke gingival epithelial cell apoptosis in a time and dose dependent manner with significant apoptosis occurring between  <dig> and  <dig> hours of challenge via a gingipain-dependent mechanism.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides evidence that live, but not heat-killed, p. gingivalis can induce apoptosis after  <dig> hours of challenge in primary human gingival epithelial cells. either arginine or lysine gingipains are necessary and sufficient factors in p. gingivalis elicited apoptosis.
