BACKGROUND
tumor-predominant splice isoforms were identified during comparative in silico sequence analysis of est clones, suggesting that global aberrant alternative pre-mrna splicing may be an epigenetic phenomenon in cancer. we used an exon expression array to perform an objective, genome-wide survey of glioma-specific splicing in  <dig> gbm and  <dig> nontumor brain samples. validation studies were performed using rt-pcr on glioma cell lines, patient tumor and nontumor brain samples.


RESULTS
in total, we confirmed  <dig> genes with glioma-specific splicing; seven were novel events identified by the exon expression array . our data indicate that large changes  in alternative splicing are infrequent in gliomagenesis . the lack of splicing changes may derive from the small number of splicing factors observed to be aberrantly expressed.


CONCLUSIONS
while we observed some tumor-specific alternative splicing, the number of genes showing exclusive tumor-specific isoforms was on the order of tens, rather than the hundreds suggested previously by in silico mining. given the important role of alternative splicing in neural differentiation, there may be selective pressure to maintain a majority of splicing events in order to retain glial-like characteristics of the tumor cells.
