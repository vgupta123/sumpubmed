BACKGROUND
locoweeds cause significant livestock poisoning and economic loss all over the world. animals can develop locoism, a chronic neurological disease, after grazing on locoweeds. oxytropis kansuensis is a variety of locoweed that contains swainsonine as its main toxic ingredient. the purpose of this study was to investigate the apoptotic pathway induced in the cerebrum by swainsonine.


RESULTS
twenty-four sprague-dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups  and  <dig> sd rats of each group were feed in  <dig> cages separately. rats were penned as groups and fed with feeds containing 15% , 30% , or 45%  o. kansuensis for experimental groups i, ii, and iii, respectively, or complete feed in the case of the control group. one hundred and nineteen days after poisoning, and all rats showed neurological disorders at different degrees, which were considered to be successful established a chronic poisoning model of o. kansuensis. rats were sacrificed and the expression of fas, fasl, bcl- <dig>  bax as well as cleaved caspase- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> proteins in brain tissues were detected by western blot. the results showed that sw treatment up-regulated fas and fas ligand  , and that there was an increase in bax and a decrease in bcl- <dig> protein . moreover, sw treatment significantly increases the activation of caspase- <dig>   <dig> and - <dig>  the key effectors in apoptosis pathway .


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that sw induces apoptosis in cells of the brain through death receptor and mitochondria-mediated, caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways in the brain tissue of sd rats.
