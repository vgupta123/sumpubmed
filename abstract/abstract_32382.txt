BACKGROUND
biochemical equilibria are usually modeled iteratively: given one or a few fitted models, if there is a lack of fit or over fitting, a new model with additional or fewer parameters is then fitted, and the process is repeated. the problem with this approach is that different analysts can propose and select different models and thus extract different binding parameter estimates from the same data. an alternative is to first generate a comprehensive standardized list of plausible models, and to then fit them exhaustively, or semi-exhaustively.


RESULTS
a framework is presented in which equilibriums are modeled as pairs  where g =  <dig> maps total reactant concentrations  into free reactant concentrations  which h then maps into expected values of measurements . by letting dissociation constants kd be either freely estimated, infinity, zero, or equal to other kd, and by letting undamaged protein fractions be either freely estimated or  <dig>  many g models are formed. a standard space of g models for ligand-induced protein dimerization equilibria is given. coupled to an h model, the resulting  were fitted to dttp induced r <dig> dimerization data . models with the fewest parameters were fitted first. thereafter, upon fitting a batch, the next batch of models  was fitted only if the current batch yielded a model that was better  than the best model in the previous batch . within batches models were fitted in parallel. this semi-exhaustive approach yielded the same best models as an exhaustive model space fit, but in approximately one-fifth the time.


CONCLUSIONS
comprehensive model space based biochemical equilibrium model selection methods are realizable. their significance to systems biology as mappings of data into mathematical models warrants their development.
