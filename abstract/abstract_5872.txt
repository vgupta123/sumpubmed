BACKGROUND
while doxorubicin  is widely used in cancer chemotherapy, long-term severe cardiotoxicity limits its use. this is the first report of the chemoprotective efficacy of a relatively new thiol antioxidant, n-acetylcysteine amide , on dox-induced cell death in cardiomyocytes. we hypothesized that naca would protect h9c <dig> cardiomyocytes from dox-induced toxicity by reducing oxidative stress. accordingly, we determined the ability of naca to mitigate the cytotoxicity of dox in h9c <dig> cells and correlated these effects with the production of indicators of oxidative stress.


RESULTS
dox at  <dig> μm induced cardiotoxicity while 1) increasing the generation of reactive oxygen species , 2) decreasing levels and activities of antioxidants and antioxidant enzymes  and 3) increasing lipid peroxidation. naca at  <dig> μm substantially reduced the levels of ros and lipid peroxidation, as well as increased both gsh level and gsh/gssg ratio. however, treating h9c <dig> cells with naca did little to protect h9c <dig> cells from dox-induced cell death.


CONCLUSIONS
although naca effectively reduced oxidative stress in dox-treated h9c <dig> cells, it had minimal effects on dox-induced cell death. naca prevented oxidative stress by elevation of gsh and cys, reduction of ros and lipid peroxidation, and restoration of antioxidant enzyme activities. further studies to identify oxidative stress-independent pathways that lead to dox-induced cell death in h9c <dig> are warranted.
