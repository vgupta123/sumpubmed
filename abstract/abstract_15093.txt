BACKGROUND
the β <dig> subunit of the γ-aminobutyric acid type a receptor  has been reported to be important for palate formation, anesthetic action, and normal nervous system function. this subunit has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of angelman syndrome and autism spectrum disorder. to further investigate involvement of this subunit, we previously produced mice with a global knockout of β <dig>  however, developmental abnormalities, compensation, reduced viability, and numerous behavioral abnormalities limited the usefulness of that murine model. to overcome many of these limitations, a mouse line with a conditionally inactivated β <dig> gene was engineered.


RESULTS
gene targeting and embryonic stem cell technologies were used to create mice in which exon  <dig> of the β <dig> subunit was flanked by loxp sites . crossing the floxed β <dig> mice to a cre general deleter mouse line reproduced the phenotype of the previously described global knockout. pan-neuronal knockout of β <dig> was achieved by crossing floxed β <dig> mice to synapsin i-cre transgenic mice. palate development was normal in pan-neuronal β <dig> knockouts but ~61% died as neonates. survivors were overtly normal, fertile, and were less sensitive to etomidate. forebrain selective knockout of β <dig> was achieved using α camkii-cre transgenic mice. palate development was normal in forebrain selective β <dig> knockout mice. these knockouts survived the neonatal period, but ~30% died between 15– <dig> days of age. survivors had reduced reproductive fitness, reduced sensitivity to etomidate, were hyperactive, and some became obese.


CONCLUSIONS
conditional inactivation of the β <dig> gene revealed novel insight into the function of this gabaa-r subunit. the floxed β <dig> knockout mice described here will be very useful for conditional knockout studies to further investigate the role of the β <dig> subunit in development, ethanol and anesthetic action, normal physiology, and pathophysiologic processes.
