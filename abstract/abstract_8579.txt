BACKGROUND
within a feasibility study the use of antibiotics in pigs and cattle was determined in  <dig> veterinary practices in lower saxony and on  <dig> farms in north rhine-westphalia in germany. focus was laid on the comparison of the used daily doses   with the defined animal daily doses  .


RESULTS
for piglets and calves most of the udd  were above the add . regarding sows, fattening pigs, dairy and beef cattle, most of the udds  were lower than the respective add . in pigs, the udds of beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins, and in cattle, those of macrolides and beta-lactams were often below the adds. tetracyclines were frequently used above the recommended dose.

enteric diseases were more often treated below the recommended dose than respiratory diseases, possibly due to overestimation of the live weight  and consequently overestimation of the recommended dose.


CONCLUSIONS
comparisons between udd and add can be used to observe differences between antimicrobials and trends in the usage of antibiotics. but individual treatment comparisons of udd and add must be interpreted carefully, because they may be due to lower live weights than estimated. correlating such data with data on the occurrence of resistant bacteria in future may help to improve resistance prevention and control.
