BACKGROUND
vertebrate classic cadherins are divided into type i and type ii subtypes, which are individually expressed in brain subdivisions  and in specific neuronal circuits in region-specific manners. we reported previously the expression of cadherin <dig>  in schwann cell precursors. cad <dig> is a type ii classic cadherin closely clustered on a chromosome with cad <dig> and cad <dig>  the expression patterns of cad <dig> and cad <dig> have been reported previously in chick embryo but not in the developing and adult central nervous system of mammals. in this study, we identified rat cad <dig> and cad <dig> and analyzed their expression patterns in embryonic and adult rat brains.


RESULTS
rat cad <dig> protein showed 92% similarity to chick cad <dig>  while rat cad <dig> protein had 76% similarity to xenopus f-cadherin. rat cad <dig> mrna was initially expressed in the anterior neural plate including presumptive forebrain and midbrain regions, and then accumulated in cells of the dorsal neural tube and in rhombomere boundary cells of the hindbrain. expression of rat cad <dig> mrna was specifically localized in the anterior neural region and rhombomere  <dig> in the early neural plate, and later in longitudinally defined ventral cells of the hindbrain. the expression boundaries of cad <dig> and cad <dig> corresponded to those of region-specific transcription factors such as six <dig>  irx <dig> and otx <dig> in the neural plate, and dbx <dig> and gsh <dig> in the hindbrain. at later stages, the expression of cad <dig> and cad <dig> disappeared from neuroepithelial cells in the hindbrain, and was almost restricted to postmitotic cells, e.g. somatic motor neurons and precerebellar neurons. these results emphasized the diversity of cad <dig> and cad <dig> expression patterns in different vertebrate species, i.e. birds and rodents.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our findings suggest that the expression of cad <dig> and cad <dig> demarcates the compartments,   boundaries, progenitor domains, specific nuclei and specific neural circuits during mammalian brain development.
