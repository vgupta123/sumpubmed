BACKGROUND
chromosome pairing, recombination and dna repair are essential processes during meiosis in sexually reproducing organisms. investigating the bread wheat  ph <dig>  locus has identified numerous candidate genes that may have a role in controlling such processes, including tamsh <dig>  a plant specific member of the dna mismatch repair family.


RESULTS
sequencing of the three msh <dig> genes, located on the short arms of wheat chromosomes 3a, 3b and 3d, has revealed no significant sequence divergence at the amino acid level suggesting conservation of function across the homoeogroups. functional analysis of msh <dig> through the use of rnai loss-of-function transgenics was undertaken in diploid barley . quantitative real-time pcr revealed several t <dig> lines with reduced msh <dig> expression. positive segregants from two t <dig> lines studied in detail showed reduced msh <dig> expression when compared to transformed controls and null segregants. expression of msh <dig>  another member of the mismatch repair family which is most closely related to the msh <dig> gene, was not significantly reduced in these lines. in both t <dig> lines, reduced seed set in positive segregants was observed.


CONCLUSIONS
results presented here indicate, for the first time, a distinct functional role for msh <dig> in vivo and show that expression of this gene is necessary for wild-type levels of fertility. these observations suggest that msh <dig> has an important function during meiosis and as such remains a candidate for ph <dig>
