BACKGROUND
the limited  coverage of the tammar wallaby  genome sequence dataset currently presents a challenge for assembly and anchoring onto chromosomes. to provide a framework for this assembly, it would be a great advantage to have a dense map of the tammar wallaby genome. however, only limited mapping data are available for this non-model species, comprising a physical map and a linkage map.


RESULTS
we combined all available tammar wallaby mapping data to create a tammar wallaby integrated map, using the location database  strategy. this first-generation integrated map combines all available information from the second-generation tammar wallaby linkage map with  <dig> loci, and extensive fish mapping data for  <dig> loci, especially for genes likely to be located at the ends of wallaby chromosomes or at evolutionary breakpoints inferred from comparative information. for loci whose positions are only approximately known, their location in the integrated map was refined on the basis of comparative information from opossum  and human. interpolation of segments from the opossum and human assemblies into the integrated map enabled the subsequent construction of a tammar wallaby first-generation virtual genome map, which comprises  <dig> markers, including  <dig> genes recruited from opossum and human assemblies. both maps are freely available at http://compldb.angis.org.au.


CONCLUSIONS
the first-generation integrated map and the first-generation virtual genome map provide a backbone for the chromosome assembly of the tammar wallaby genome sequence. for example, 78% of the  <dig> gene-scaffolds in the ensembl annotation of the tammar wallaby genome sequence  can now be given a chromosome location in the tammar wallaby virtual genome map.
