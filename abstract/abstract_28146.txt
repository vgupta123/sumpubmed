BACKGROUND
gene duplication has led to a most remarkable adaptation involved in vertebrates’ host-pathogen arms-race, the major histocompatibility complex . however, mhc duplication history is as yet poorly understood in non-mammalian vertebrates, including birds.


RESULTS
here, we provide evidence for the evolution of two ancient avian mhc class iib  lineages by a duplication event prior to the radiation of all extant birds > <dig> million years ago, and document the role of concerted evolution in eroding the footprints of the avian mhciib duplication history.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that eroded footprints of gene duplication histories may mimic birth-death evolution and that in the avian mhc the presence of the two lineages may have been masked by elevated rates of concerted evolution in several taxa. through the presence of a range of intermediate evolutionary stages along the homogenizing process of concerted evolution, the avian mhciib provides a remarkable illustration of the erosion of multigene family duplication history.
