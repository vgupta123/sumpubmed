BACKGROUND
cytochrome p <dig> cyp2c <dig> metabolizes a wide range of pharmacologically active substances and a relatively small number of naturally occurring environmental toxins. poor activity alleles of cyp2c <dig> are very frequent worldwide, particularly in asia, raising the possibility that reduced metabolism could be advantageous in some circumstances. the evolutionary selective forces acting on this gene have not previously been investigated.

we analyzed cyp2c <dig> genetic markers from  <dig> gambians and on  <dig> chromosomes from yoruba, europeans and asians  in the hapmap database. haplotype breakdown was explored using bifurcation plots and relative extended haplotype homozygosity . allele frequency differentiation across populations was estimated using the fixation index  and haplotype diversity with coalescent models.


RESULTS
bifurcation plots suggested conservation of alleles conferring slow metabolism . rehh was high around cyp2c19* <dig> in yoruba  and to a lesser extent in europeans  and asians . fst at the cyp2c <dig> locus was low overall . cyp2c19* <dig> was an fst outlier in asians , cyp2c <dig> haplotype diversity < =  <dig> , p < <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
we found some evidence that the slow metabolizing allele cyp2c19* <dig> is subject to positive selective forces worldwide. similar evidence was also found for cyp2c19* <dig> which is frequent only in asia. fst is low at the cyp2c <dig> locus, suggesting balancing selection overall. the biological factors responsible for these selective pressures are currently unknown. one possible explanation is that early humans were exposed to a ubiquitous novel toxin activated by cyp2c <dig>  the genetic adaptation took place within the last  <dig>  years which coincides with the development of systematic agricultural practices.
