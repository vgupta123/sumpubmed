BACKGROUND
the mechanisms that regulate the activity of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase ack <dig>  are poorly understood. the amino-terminal region of ack <dig> is predicted to contain a sterile alpha motif  domain. sam domains share a common fold and mediate protein-protein interactions in a wide variety of proteins. here, we addressed the importance of the ack <dig> sam domain in kinase activity.


RESULTS
we used immunofluorescence and western blotting to show that ack <dig> deletion mutants lacking the n-terminus displayed significantly reduced autophosphorylation in cells. a minimal construct comprising the n-terminus and kinase domain  was autophosphorylated, while the kinase domain alone  was not. when expressed in mammalian cells, nkd localized to the plasma membrane, while kd showed a more diffuse cytosolic localization. co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed a stronger interaction between full length ack <dig> and nkd than between full length ack <dig> and kd, indicating that the n-terminus was important for ack <dig> dimerization. increasing the local concentration of purified ack <dig> kinase domain at the surface of lipid vesicles stimulated autophosphorylation and catalytic activity, consistent with a requirement for dimerization and trans-phosphorylation for activity.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, the data suggest that the n-terminus of ack <dig> promotes membrane localization and dimerization to allow for autophosphorylation.
