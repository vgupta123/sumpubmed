BACKGROUND
shine-dalgarno  signal has long been viewed as the dominant translation initiation signal in prokaryotes. recently, leaderless genes, which lack 5'-untranslated regions  on their mrnas, have been shown abundant in archaea. however, current large-scale in silico analyses on initiation mechanisms in bacteria are mainly based on the sd-led initiation way, other than the leaderless one. the study of leaderless genes in bacteria remains open, which causes uncertain understanding of translation initiation mechanisms for prokaryotes.


RESULTS
here, we study signals in translation initiation regions of all genes over  <dig> bacterial and  <dig> archaeal genomes, then make an effort to construct an evolutionary scenario in view of leaderless genes in bacteria. with an algorithm designed to identify multi-signal in upstream regions of genes for a genome, we classify all genes into sd-led, ta-led and atypical genes according to the category of the most probable signal in their upstream sequences. particularly, occurrence of ta-like signals about  <dig> bp upstream to translation initiation site  in bacteria most probably means leaderless genes.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis reveals that leaderless genes are totally widespread, although not dominant, in a variety of bacteria. especially for actinobacteria and deinococcus-thermus, more than twenty percent of genes are leaderless. analyzed in closely related bacterial genomes, our results imply that the change of translation initiation mechanisms, which happens between the genes deriving from a common ancestor, is linearly dependent on the phylogenetic relationship. analysis on the macroevolution of leaderless genes further shows that the proportion of leaderless genes in bacteria has a decreasing trend in evolution.
