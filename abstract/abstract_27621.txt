BACKGROUND
inappropriate activation of t lymphocytes plays an important role in perinatal complications. however, data on t lymphocyte activation markers of preterm infants is scarce. we investigated the association between gender, gestational and postnatal age, preeclampsia , premature rupture of membranes  as well as prenatal steroid treatment  and the frequency of activated t lymphocyte subsets  and major t lymphocyte subpopulations  in peripheral blood during the first postnatal week in preterm infants.


RESULTS
cord blood and peripheral blood samples were collected from  <dig> preterm infants on the 1st, 3rd, and 7th days of life. we assessed the frequency of the above t lymphocyte subsets using flow cytometry. the ‘mixed effect model’ was used to analyze the effects of clinical parameters on t lymphocyte markers. the frequency of cd25+ t lymphocytes was higher in prom. the frequency of cd4+ and cd8+ cells and the cd4+/cd8+ cell ratio was decreased in pe. the frequency of cd62l+ t lymphocytes was higher in male compared with female infants. ps did not affect the frequency of the investigated markers. cd4+ cd25+ cells had a lower frequency at birth than on day  <dig>  th <dig> lymphocytes had a lower frequency on postnatal days  <dig> and  <dig> when compared to day  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our observations indicate that alterations affecting the expression of t lymphocyte activation markers are associated with the above factors and may play a role in the development of perinatal complications.
