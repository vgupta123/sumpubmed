BACKGROUND
absence of or low sensitivity to photoperiod is necessary for short-day crops, such as rice and soybean, to adapt to high latitudes. photoperiod insensitivity in soybeans is controlled by two genetic systems and involves three important maturity genes: e <dig>  a repressor for two soybean orthologs of arabidopsis flowering locus t , and e <dig> and e <dig>  which are phytochrome a genes. to elucidate the diverse mechanisms underlying photoperiod insensitivity in soybean, we assessed the genotypes of four maturity genes  in early-flowering photoperiod-insensitive cultivars and their association with post-flowering responses.


RESULTS
we found two novel dysfunctional alleles in accessions originally considered to have a dominant e <dig> allele according to known dna markers. the e <dig> locus, together with e <dig> and e <dig>  contained multiple dysfunctional alleles. we identified  <dig> multi-locus genotypes, which we subdivided into  <dig> genotypic groups by classifying their alleles by function. of these, the e1-as/e3/e <dig> genotypic group required an additional novel gene  to condition photoperiod insensitivity. despite their common pre-flowering photoperiod insensitivity, accessions with different multi-locus genotypes responded differently to the post-flowering photoperiod. cultivars carrying e <dig> or e <dig> were sensitive to photoperiod for post-flowering characteristics, such as reproductive period and stem growth after flowering. the phytochrome aâ€“regulated expression of the determinate growth habit gene dt <dig>  an ortholog of arabidopsis terminal flower <dig>  was involved in the persistence of the vegetative activity at the stem apical meristem of flower-induced plants under long-day conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
diverse genetic mechanisms underlie photoperiod insensitivity in soybean. at least three multi-locus genotypes consisting of various allelic combinations at e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> conferred pre-flowering photoperiod insensitivity to soybean cultivars but led to different responses to photoperiod during post-flowering vegetative and reproductive development. the phya genes e <dig> and e <dig> are major controllers underlying not only pre-flowering but also post-flowering photoperiod responses. the current findings improve our understanding of genetic diversity in pre-flowering photoperiod insensitivity and mechanisms of post-flowering photoperiod responses in soybean.
