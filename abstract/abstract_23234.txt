BACKGROUND
for more than a decade there has been increasing interest in the use of nanotechnology and microarray platforms for diagnostic applications. in this report, we describe a rapid and simple gold nanoparticle -based genomic microarray assay for specific identification of avian influenza virus h5n <dig> and its discrimination from other major influenza a virus strains .


RESULTS
capture and intermediate oligonucleotides were designed based on the consensus sequences of the matrix  gene of h1n <dig>  h3n <dig> and h5n <dig> viruses, and sequences specific for the hemaglutinin  and neuraminidase  genes of the h5n <dig> virus. viral rna was detected within  <dig>  hours using capture-target-intermediate oligonucleotide hybridization and gold np-mediated silver staining in the absence of rna fragmentation, target amplification, and enzymatic reactions. the lower limit of detection  of the assay was less than  <dig> fm for purified pcr fragments and  <dig> tcid <dig> units for h5n <dig> viral rna.


CONCLUSIONS
the np-based microarray assay was able to detect and distinguish h5n <dig> sequences from those of major influenza a viruses . the new method described here may be useful for simultaneous detection and subtyping of major influenza a viruses.
