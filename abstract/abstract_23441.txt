BACKGROUND
the import of solutes into the bacterial cytoplasm involves several types of membrane transporters, which may be driven by atp hydrolysis  or by an ion or h+ electrochemical membrane potential, as in the tripartite atp-independent periplasmic system . in both the abc and trap systems, a specific periplasmic protein from the esr family  is often involved for the recruitment of the solute and its presentation to the membrane complex. in rhodobacter sphaeroides, takp  is an esr from a trap transporter and binds α-keto acids in vitro.


RESULTS
we describe the high-resolution crystal structures of takp in its unliganded form and as a complex with sodium-pyruvate. the results show a limited "venus flytrap" conformational change induced by substrate binding. in the liganded structure, a cation  is present and plays a key role in the association of the pyruvate to the protein. the structure of the binding pocket gives a rationale for the relative affinities of various ligands that were tested from a fluorescence assay. the protein appears to be dimeric in solution and in the crystals, with a helix-swapping structure largely participating in the dimer formation. a  <dig> Å-long water channel buried at the dimer interface connects the two ligand binding cavities of the dimer.


CONCLUSIONS
the concerted recruitment by takp of the substrate group with a cation could represent a first step in the coupled transport of both partners, providing the driving force for solute import. furthermore, the unexpected dimeric structure of takp suggests a molecular mechanism of solute uptake by the dimeric esr via a channel that connects the binding sites of the two monomers.
