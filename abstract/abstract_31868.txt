BACKGROUND
the incu conjugative transfer module represents highly efficient promiscuous system widespread among conjugative plasmids of different incompatibility groups. despite its frequent occurrence the mechanisms of relaxosome formation/action are far from understood. here we analyzed the putative transfer auxiliary protein mobc of the conjugative plasmid ra <dig> from the incu incompatibility group.


RESULTS
mobc is a protein of  <dig> amino acids encoded in the bicistronic operon mobc-nic adjacent to orit. mobc is homologous to prokaryotic transcription factors of the ribbon-helix-helix  superfamily. conserved lxxugxnlnqiaxxln motif clusters mobc with the clade of conjugative transfer auxilliary proteins of mobp relaxases. mobc forms dimers in solution and autoregulates the expression of mobcp by binding to an imperfect palindromic sequence  located between putative - <dig> and - <dig> motifs of the promoter. medium-copy number test plasmid containing the orit-mobcp region is mobilized with a high frequency by the ra <dig> conjugative system. the mutations introduced into om that abolished mobc binding in vitro decreased 2- <dig> fold the frequency of mobilization of the test plasmids. the deletion of om within the ra <dig> conjugative module had no effect on transfer if the mobc-nic operon was expressed from the heterologous promoter. if only nic was expressed from the heterologous promoter  the conjugative transfer frequency of such plasmid was 1000-fold lower.


CONCLUSIONS
the mobc is an auxiliary transfer protein of dual function. it autoregulates the expression of mobc-nic operon while its presence significantly stimulates transfer efficiency.
