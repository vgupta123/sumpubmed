BACKGROUND
snails species belonging to the genus bulinus  serve as intermediate host for flukes belonging to the genus schistosoma . despite its importance in the transmission of these parasites, the evolutionary history of this genus is still obscure. in the present study, we used the partial mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit i  gene, and the nuclear ribosomal its, 18s and 28s genes to investigate the haplotype diversity and phylogeny of seven bulinus species originating from three endemic countries in africa .


RESULTS
the cox <dig> region showed much more variation than the ribosomal markers within bulinus sequences. high levels of genetic diversity were detected at all loci in the seven studied species, with clear segregation between individuals and appearance of different haplotypes, even within same species from the same locality. sequences clustered into two lineages;  groups bulinus truncatus, b. tropicus, b. globosus and b. umbilicatus; while  groups b. forskalii, b. senegalensis and b. camerunensis. interesting patterns emerge regarding schistosome susceptibility: bulinus species with lower genetic diversity are predicted to have higher infection prevalence than those with greater diversity in host susceptibility.


CONCLUSIONS
the results reported in this study are very important since a detailed understanding of the population genetic structure of bulinus is essential to understand the epidemiology of many schistosome parasites.
