BACKGROUND
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  is a major nosocomial pathogen worldwide. the need for accurate and rapid screening methods to detect mrsa carriers has been clearly established. the performance of a novel assay, baclite rapid mrsa  for the rapid detection  and identification of hospital associated ciprofloxacin resistant strains of mrsa directly from nasal swab specimens was compared to that obtained by culture on mannitol salt agar containing oxacillin  after  <dig> h incubation.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> nasal screening swabs were tested by multiple operators. the baclite rapid mrsa test detected  <dig> out of the  <dig> confirmed mrsa that were detected on msao giving a diagnostic sensitivity of  <dig> , diagnostic specificity of  <dig> % and a negative predictive value of  <dig> %. of the  <dig> false negatives obtained by the baclite rapid mrsa test, seven grew small amounts  on the msao culture plate and five isolates were ciprofloxacin sensitive. however there were  <dig> confirmed baclite mrsa positive samples, which were negative by the direct culture method, probably due to overgrowth on the msao plate. there were  <dig> false positive results obtained by the baclite rapid mrsa test at  <dig> h and  <dig> cases where mrsa colonies were tentatively identified on the msao plate when read at  <dig> h, and which subsequently proved not to be mrsa.


CONCLUSIONS
the baclite mrsa test is easy to use and provides a similar level of sensitivity to conventional culture for the detection of nasal carriage of mrsa with the advantage that the results are obtained much more rapidly.
