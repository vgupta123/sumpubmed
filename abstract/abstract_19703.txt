BACKGROUND
gad <dig>  is one of the most important auto-antigens involved in type  <dig> diabetes induction. although it serves as one of the first injury markers of β-islets, the mechanisms governing gad <dig> expression remain poorly understood. since the regulation of gad <dig> is crucial for the proper functioning of insulin secreting cells, we investigated the stress induced regulation of gad <dig> transcription.


RESULTS
the present study shows that smar <dig> regulates gad <dig> expression at the transcription level. using a novel protein-dna pull-down assay, we show that smar <dig> binding is very specific to gad <dig> promoter but not to the other isoform, gad <dig>  we show that streptozotocin  mediated dna damage leads to upregulation of smar <dig> and p <dig> expression, resulting in elevated levels of gad <dig>  in both cell lines as well as mouse β-islets. smar <dig> and p <dig> act synergistically to up-regulate gad <dig> expression upon stz treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose a novel mechanism of gad <dig> regulation by synergistic activities of smar <dig> and p <dig>
