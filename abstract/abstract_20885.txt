BACKGROUND
the actin cytoskeleton participates in many fundamental processes including the regulation of cell shape, motility, and adhesion. the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is dependent on actin binding proteins, which organize actin filaments into specific structures that allow them to perform various specialized functions. the eps <dig> family of proteins is implicated in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton remodeling during cell migration, yet the precise mechanism by which eps <dig> regulates actin organization and remodeling remains elusive.


RESULTS
here, we show that eps <dig> promotes the assembly of actin rich filopodia-like structures and actin cables in cultured mammalian cells and xenopus embryos, respectively. the morphology of actin structures induced by eps <dig> was modulated by interactions with abi <dig>  which stimulated formation of actin cables in cultured cells and star-like structures in xenopus. the actin stars observed in xenopus animal cap cells assembled at the apical surface of epithelial cells in a rac-independent manner and their formation was accompanied by recruitment of n-wasp, suggesting that the eps8/abi <dig> complex is capable of regulating the localization and/or activity of actin nucleators. we also found that eps <dig> recruits dishevelled to the plasma membrane and actin filaments suggesting that eps <dig> might participate in non-canonical wnt/polarity signaling. consistent with this idea, mis-expression of eps <dig> in dorsal regions of xenopus embryos resulted in gastrulation defects.


CONCLUSIONS
together, these results suggest that eps <dig> plays multiple roles in modulating actin filament organization, possibly through its interaction with distinct sets of actin regulatory complexes. furthermore, the finding that eps <dig> interacts with dsh and induced gastrulation defects provides evidence that eps <dig> might participate in non-canonical wnt signaling to control cell movements during vertebrate development.
