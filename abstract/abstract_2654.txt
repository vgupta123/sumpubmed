BACKGROUND
electrophysiological studies of l-type ca2+ channels in isolated vascular smooth muscle cells revealed that depolarization of these cells evoked a transient and a time-independent ca2+ current. the sustained, non-inactivating current occurred at voltages where voltage-dependent activation and inactivation overlapped  and its contribution to basal tone or active tension in larger multicellular blood vessel preparations is unknown at present. this study investigated whether window ca2+ influx affects isometric contraction of multicellular c57bl <dig> mouse aortic segments.


RESULTS
intracellular ca2+ , membrane potential and isometric force were measured in aortic segments, which were clamped at fixed membrane potentials by increasing extracellular k+ concentrations. k+ above 20â€‰mm evoked biphasic contractions, which were not affected by inhibition of ip3- or ca2+ induced ca2+ release with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate or ryanodine, respectively, ruling out the contribution of intracellular ca2+ release. the fast force component paralleled cai2+ increase, but the slow contraction coincided with cai2+ decrease. in the absence of extracellular ca2+, basal tension and cai2+ declined, and depolarization failed to evoke cai2+ signals or contraction. subsequent re-introduction of external ca2+ elicited only slow contractions, which were now matched by cai2+ increase. after cai2+ attained steady-state, isometric force kept increasing due to ca2+- sensitization of the contractile elements. the slow force responses displayed a bell-shaped voltage-dependence, were suppressed by hyperpolarization with levcromakalim, and enhanced by an agonist of l-type ca2+ channels .


CONCLUSIONS
the isometric response of mouse aortic segments to depolarization consists of a fast, transient contraction paralleled by a transient ca2+ influx via ca2+ channels which completely inactivate. ca2+ channels, which did not completely inactivate during the depolarization, initiated a second, sustained phase of contraction, which was matched by a sustained non-inactivating window ca2+ influx. together with sensitization, this window l-type ca2+ influx is a major determinant of basal and active tension of mouse aortic smooth muscle.
