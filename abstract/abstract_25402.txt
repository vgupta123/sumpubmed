BACKGROUND
in plants, rna editing is a process that converts specific cytidines to uridines and uridines to cytidines in transcripts from virtually all mitochondrial protein-coding genes. there are thousands of plant mitochondrial genes in the sequence databases, but sites of rna editing have not been determined for most. accurate methods of rna editing site prediction will be important in filling in this information gap and could reduce or even eliminate the need for experimental determination of editing sites for many sequences. because rna editing tends to increase protein conservation across species by "correcting" codons that specify unconserved amino acids, this principle can be used to predict editing sites by identifying positions where an rna editing event would increase the conservation of a protein to homologues from other plants. prep-mt takes this approach to predict editing sites for any protein-coding gene in plant mitochondria.


RESULTS
to test the general applicability of the prep-mt methodology, rna editing sites were predicted for  <dig> full-length or nearly full-length dna sequences and then compared to the known sites of rna editing for these sequences. of  <dig>  cytidines in this test set, prep-mt correctly classified  <dig>  as either an edited or unedited site . prep-mt properly identified  <dig>  of the  <dig>  known sites of rna editing  and  <dig>  of the  <dig>  known unedited sites . accuracy and sensitivity increased to  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, after excluding the  <dig> silent editing sites  from the test set.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that prep-mt is effective at identifying c to u rna editing sites in plant mitochondrial protein-coding genes. thus, prep-mt should be useful in predicting protein sequences for use in molecular, biochemical, and phylogenetic analyses. in addition, prep-mt could be used to determine functionality of a mitochondrial gene or to identify particular sequences with unusual editing properties. the prep-mt methodology should be applicable to any system where rna editing increases protein conservation across species.
