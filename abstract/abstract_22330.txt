BACKGROUND
the cop <dig> signalosome  is a conserved protein complex in eukaryotic cells consisting of eight subunits . recent data demonstrate that the csn is a regulator of the ubiquitin  proteasome system . it controls substrate ubiquitination by cullin-ring ub ligases , a process that determines substrate specificity of the ups. the intrinsic deneddylating activity localized to csn <dig> as well as the associated kinases and deubiquitinating activity are involved in the regulatory function of csn. the exact mechanisms are unclear. in this study we knocked down csn <dig> , csn <dig>  and csn <dig>  by specific sirna oligos permanently expressed in hela cells. the analysis and comparison of sirna cells revealed differential impact of individual subunits on csn structure and function.


RESULTS
permanent knockdowns of csn <dig> and csn <dig> led to a reduction of the subunits to approximately 40%, which is accompanied by a proportional decrease of the csn holocomplex. in contrast, downregulation of csn <dig> in hela cells reduced the csn <dig> protein below 20% without significant effects on the remaining complex. the crl component rbx <dig> was characterized by accelerated proteolysis in sicsn <dig> and sicsn <dig> and also in sicsn <dig> cells, however, with lesser extent. immunoprecipitated csn complex from sicsn <dig> cells was less effective in phosphorylating c-jun and p <dig>  accelerated degradation of c-jun in sicsn <dig> cells was rescued by overexpression of csn <dig> as well as of the deneddylation mutant csn5d151n. overexpression of csn <dig> cannot rescue c-jun destabilization in sicsn <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
there exists a coordinated downregulation of csn subunits in the csn <dig> and csn <dig> knockdowns. the underlying regulatory mechanisms are obscure. csn <dig> seems to possess a specific status in hela cells. its reduction is not connected with coordinated downregulation of other subunits. csn knockdowns confirm that the stabilization of the crl component rbx <dig> is a major csn function. in addition, downregulation of csn subunits influences the stability of important cellular regulators such as c-jun and p <dig>
