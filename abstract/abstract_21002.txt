BACKGROUND
the life cycle of human immunodeficiency virus type- <dig>  makes possible the realization of regulatory strategies that can lead to complex dynamical behavior of the system. we analyze the strategy which is based on two feedback mechanisms, one mediating a positive regulation of the virus replication by tat protein via the antitermination of the genomic rnas transcription on tar  element of the proviral dna and the second mechanism providing a negative regulation of the splicing of the full-length  rnas and incompletely spliced  rnas via their transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. although the existence of these two regulatory feedback loops has been considered in other mathematical models, none of them examined the conditions for the emergence of complex oscillatory patterns in the intracellular dynamics of viral components.


RESULTS
we developed a mechanistic mathematical model for the tat-rev mediated regulation of hiv- <dig> replication, which considers the activation of proviral dna transcription, the tat-specific antitermination of transcription on tar-element, resulting in the synthesis of the full-length  <dig> kb rna, the splicing of the  <dig> kb rna down to the  <dig> kb rna and the  <dig> kb rna to  <dig> kb rna, the transport of  <dig> kb mrnas from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by the intracellular mechanisms, the multiple binding of the rev protein to rre  sites on  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb rna resulting in their export to the cytoplasm and the synthesis of tat and rev proteins in the cytoplasm followed by their transport into the nucleus. the degradation of all viral proteins and rnas both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus is described. the model parameters values were derived from the published literature data. the model was used to examine the dynamics of the synthesis of the viral proteins tat and rev, the mrnas under the intracellular conditions specific for activated hiv- <dig> infected macrophages. in addition, we analyzed alternative hypotheses for the re-cycling of the rev proteins both in the cytoplasm and the nuclear pore complex.


CONCLUSIONS
the quantitative mathematical model of the tat-rev regulation of hiv- <dig> replication predicts the existence of oscillatory dynamics which depends on the efficacy of the tat and tar interaction as well as on the rev-mediated transport processes. the biological relevance of the oscillatory regimes for the hiv- <dig> life cycle is discussed.
