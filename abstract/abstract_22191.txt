BACKGROUND
rhizobium tropici strain prf  <dig>  has been used in commercial inoculants for application to common-bean crops in brazil since  <dig>  due to its high efficiency in fixing nitrogen, competitiveness against indigenous rhizobial populations and capacity to adapt to stressful tropical conditions, representing a key alternative to application of n-fertilizers. the objective of our study was to obtain an overview of adaptive responses to heat stress of strain prf  <dig>  by analyzing differentially expressed proteins when the bacterium is grown at 28°c and 35°c.


RESULTS
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis  revealed up-regulation of fifty-nine spots that were identified by maldi-tof/tof-tof. differentially expressed proteins were associated with the functional cog categories of metabolism, cellular processes and signaling, information storage and processing. among the up-regulated proteins, we found some related to conserved heat responses, such as molecular chaperones dnak and groel, and other related proteins, such as translation factors ef-tu, ef-g, ef-ts and if <dig>  interestingly, several oxidative stress-responsive proteins were also up-regulated, and these results reveal the diversity of adaptation mechanisms presented by this thermotolerant strain, suggesting a cross-talk between heat and oxidative stresses.


CONCLUSIONS
our data provide valuable protein-expression information relevant to the ongoing genome sequencing of strain prf  <dig>  and contributes to our still-poor knowledge of the molecular determinants of the thermotolerance exhibited by r. tropici species.
