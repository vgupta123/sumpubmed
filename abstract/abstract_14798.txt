BACKGROUND
granulocyte colony stimulating factor  is a growth factor essential for generation of neutrophilic granulocytes. apart from this hematopoietic function, we have recently uncovered potent neuroprotective and regenerative properties of g-csf in the central nervous system . the g-csf receptor and g-csf itself are expressed in Î± motoneurons, g-csf protects motoneurons, and improves outcome in the sod <dig> transgenic mouse model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . in vitro, g-csf acts anti-apoptotically on motoneuronal cells. due to the pleiotrophic effects of g-csf and the complexity of the sod <dig> transgenic als models it was however not possible to clearly distinguish between directly mediated anti-apoptotic and indirectly protective effects on motoneurons. here we studied whether g-csf is able to protect motoneurons from purely apoptotic cell death induced by a monocausal paradigm, neonatal sciatic nerve axotomy.


RESULTS
we performed sciatic nerve axotomy in neonatal mice overexpressing g-csf in the cns and found that g-csf transgenic mice displayed significantly higher numbers of surviving lumbar motoneurons  <dig> days following axotomy than their littermate controls. also, surviving motoneurons in g-csf overexpressing animals were larger, suggesting additional trophic effects of this growth factor.


CONCLUSIONS
in this model of pure apoptotic cell death the protective effects of g-csf indicate direct actions of g-csf on motoneurons in vivo. this shows that g-csf exerts potent anti-apoptotic activities towards motoneurons in vivo and suggests that the protection offered by g-csf in als mouse models is due to its direct neuroprotective activity.
