BACKGROUND
g-protein-coupled receptors  play a key role in diverse physiological processes and are the targets of almost two-thirds of the marketed drugs. the  <dig> d structures of gpcrs are largely unavailable; however, a large number of gpcr primary sequences are known. to facilitate the identification and characterization of novel receptors, it is therefore very valuable to develop a computational method to accurately predict gpcrs from the protein primary sequences.


RESULTS
we propose a new method called pca-gpcr, to predict gpcrs using a comprehensive set of  <dig> sequence-derived features. the principal component analysis is first employed to reduce the dimension of the feature space to  <dig>  then, the resulting 32-dimensional feature vectors are fed into a simple yet powerful classification algorithm, called intimate sorting, to predict gpcrs at five levels. the prediction at the first level determines whether a protein is a gpcr or a non-gpcr. if it is predicted to be a gpcr, then it will be further predicted into certain family, subfamily, sub-subfamily and subtype by the classifiers at the second, third, fourth, and fifth levels, respectively. to train the classifiers applied at five levels, a non-redundant dataset is carefully constructed, which contains  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> protein sequences at the respective levels. jackknife tests on this training dataset show that the overall accuracies of pca-gpcr at five levels  can achieve up to  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. we further perform predictions on a dataset of  <dig> gpcrs at the second level, and on another two datasets of  <dig> and  <dig> gpcrs respectively at the fourth level. the overall prediction accuracies of our method are consistently higher than those of the existing methods to be compared.


CONCLUSIONS
the comprehensive set of  <dig> features is believed to be capable of capturing information about amino acid composition, sequence order as well as various physicochemical properties of proteins. therefore, high accuracies are achieved when predicting gpcrs at all the five levels with our proposed method.
