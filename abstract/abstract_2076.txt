BACKGROUND
the chicken karyotype is composed of  <dig> chromosome pairs, of which  <dig> still remain totally absent from the current genome sequence assembly, despite international efforts towards complete coverage. some others are only very partially sequenced, amongst which microchromosome  <dig> , particularly under-represented, with only  <dig> kb assembled for a full estimated size of  <dig> to  <dig> mb. besides the obvious need of full genome coverage with genetic markers for qtl  mapping and major genes identification studies, there is a major interest in the detailed study of this chromosome because it carries the two genetically independent mhc complexes b and y. in addition, gga <dig> carries the ribosomal rna  genes cluster, also known as the nor . the purpose of the present study is to construct and present high resolution integrated maps of gga <dig> to refine its organization and improve its coverage with genetic markers.


RESULTS
we developed  <dig> sts  markers to build a physical rh  map and  <dig> genetic markers to extend the genetic map of gga <dig>  we screened a bac  library with markers for the mhc-b, mhc-y and rrna complexes. selected clones were used to perform high resolution fish  mapping on giant meiotic lampbrush chromosomes, allowing meiotic mapping in addition to the confirmation of the order of the three clusters along the chromosome. a region with high recombination rates and containing po <dig> repeated elements separates the two mhc complexes.


CONCLUSIONS
the three complementary mapping strategies used refine greatly our knowledge of chicken microchromosome  <dig> organisation. the characterisation of the recombination hotspots separating the two mhc complexes demonstrates the presence of po <dig> repetitive sequences both in tandem and inverted orientation. however, this region still needs to be studied in more detail.
