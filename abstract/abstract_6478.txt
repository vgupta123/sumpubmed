BACKGROUND
high throughput sequencing is frequently used to discover the location of regulatory interactions on chromatin. however, techniques that enrich dna where regulatory activity takes place, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation , often yield less dna than optimal for sequencing library preparation. existing protocols for picogram-scale libraries require concomitant fragmentation of dna, pre-amplification, or long overnight steps.


RESULTS
we report a simple and fast library construction method that produces libraries from sub-nanogram quantities of dna. this protocol yields conventional libraries with barcodes suitable for multiplexed sample analysis on the illumina platform. we demonstrate the utility of this method by constructing a chip-seq library from  <dig> pg of chip dna that demonstrates equivalent genomic coverage of target regions to a library produced from a larger scale experiment.


CONCLUSIONS
application of this method allows whole genome studies from samples where material or yields are limiting.
