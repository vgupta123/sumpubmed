BACKGROUND
in  <dig>  we found healthy subjects carrying st <dig> escherichia coli in their intestinal microbiota consisting of two populations: a subdominant population of fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli belonging to subclone h <dig> , the current worldwide dominant st <dig> subclone, and a dominant e. coli population composed of antibiotic-susceptible e. coli belonging to subclone h <dig> , the precursor of subclone h <dig>  we sequenced the whole genome of fecal h <dig> strain s <dig>  compared it to the genomes of expec st <dig> h30-rx strain jj <dig> and commensal st <dig> h <dig> strain se <dig>  sought the h22-h <dig> genomic differences in our fecal strains and assessed their phenotypic consequences.


RESULTS
we detected  <dig> genes found in the virulence factor database, of which  <dig> were shared by the three st <dig> genomes, whereas some were genome-specific, notably those allowing determination of virotype . we found three sequences of the fimh site involved in adhesion: two in s <dig> and se <dig> close and identical, respectively, to that previously reported to confer strong intestinal adhesion, and one in jj <dig>  corresponding to that commonly present in uropathogenic e. coli. among the genes involved in sugar metabolism, one encoding a gluconate kinase lacked in s <dig> and jj <dig>  although this gene was also absent in both our fecal h <dig> and h30-r strains, h <dig> strains showed a higher capacity to grow in minimal medium with gluconate. among the genes involved in gluconate metabolism, only the ghrb gene differed between s250/h <dig> and jj1886/h30-r strains, resulting in different gluconate reductases. of the genes involved in biofilm formation, two were absent in the three genomes and one, fimb, in the jj <dig> genome. our fecal h30-r strains lacking intact fimb displayed delayed biofilm formation relative to our fecal h <dig> strains. the h <dig> strains differed by subclade b type and plasmid content, whereas the h30-r strains were identical.


CONCLUSIONS
phenotypic analysis of our fecal strains based on observed genomic differences between s <dig> and jj <dig> strains suggests the presence of traits related to bacterial commensalism in our h <dig> strains and traits commonly found in uropathogenic e. coli in our h30-r strains.
