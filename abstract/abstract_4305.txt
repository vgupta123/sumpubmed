BACKGROUND
micrornas  are endogenous, noncoding, short rnas directly involved in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. in spite of immense importance, limited information of p. vulgaris mirnas and their expression patterns prompted us to identify new mirnas in p. vulgaris by computational methods. besides conventional approaches, we have used the simple sequence repeat  signatures as one of the prediction parameter. moreover, for all other parameters including normalized shannon entropy, normalized base pairing index and normalized base-pair distance, instead of taking a fixed cut-off value, we have used 99 % probability range derived from the available data.


RESULTS
we have identified  <dig> mature mirnas in p. vulgaris belonging to  <dig> families, of which  <dig> are novel.  <dig> of the predicted mirnas in p. vulgaris were validated with the sequencing data obtained from the small rna sequencing of p. vulgaris. randomly selected predicted mirnas were also validated using qrt-pcr. a total of  <dig> target sequences were identified for  <dig> predicted mirnas. using 80 % sequence identity cut-off, proteins coded by  <dig> targets were identified. the computational method developed in this study was also validated by predicting  <dig> mirnas of a. thaliana and  <dig> mirnas of g. max, of which  <dig> for a. thaliana and  <dig> for g. max are existing in mirbase  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
there is no universal ssr that is conserved among all precursors of viridiplantae, but conserved ssr exists within a mirna family and is used as a signature in our prediction method. prediction of known mirnas of a. thaliana and g. max validates the accuracy of our method. our findings will contribute to the present knowledge of mirnas and their targets in p. vulgaris. this computational method can be applied to any species of viridiplantae for the successful prediction of mirnas and their targets.
