BACKGROUND
as the preparation of salads involves extensive handling and the use of uncooked ingredients, they are particularly vulnerable to microbial contamination. this study aimed to determine the microbial safety and quality of pre-packed salads and salad bar ingredients sold in singapore, so as to identify public health risks that could arise from consuming salads and to determine areas for improvement in the management of food safety.


RESULTS
the most frequently encountered organism in pre-packed salad samples was b. cereus, particularly in pasta salads . the most commonly detected organism in salad bar ingredients was l. monocytogenes, in particular seafood ingredients , largely due to contaminated smoked salmon. further investigation showed that  <dig> %  of the pre-packed smoked salmon sold in supermarkets contained l. monocytogenes. significantly higher prevalence of l. monocytogenes and higher standard plate count were detected in smoked salmon at salad bars compared to pre-packed smoked salmon in supermarkets, which suggested multiplication of the organism as the products move down the supply chain. further molecular analysis revealed that l. monocytogenes sequence type   <dig> and st <dig> were present in a particular brand of pre-packed salmon products over a 4-year period, implying a potential persistent contamination problem at the manufacturing level.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings highlighted a need to improve manufacturing and retail hygiene processes as well as to educate vulnerable populations to avoid consuming food prone to l. monocytogenes contamination.
