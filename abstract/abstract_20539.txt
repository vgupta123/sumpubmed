BACKGROUND
wheat is a major crop in the world, and the high temperature stress can reduce the yield of wheat by as much as 15%. the molecular changes in response to heat stress are poorly understood. using genechipÂ® wheat genome array, we analyzed genome-wide gene expression profiles in the leaves of two wheat genotypes, namely, heat susceptible 'chinese spring'  and heat tolerant 'tam107' .


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  probe sets displayed 2-fold or more changes in expression in at least one heat treatment . except for heat shock protein  and heat shock factor  genes, these putative heat responsive genes encode transcription factors and proteins involved in phytohormone biosynthesis/signaling, calcium and sugar signal pathways, rna metabolism, ribosomal proteins, primary and secondary metabolisms, as well as proteins related to other stresses. a total of  <dig> probe sets were differentially expressed between the two genotypes, which could be responsible for the difference in heat tolerance of the two genotypes. moreover,  <dig> were differentially expressed between the heat treatments with and without pre-acclimation, and  <dig> were differentially expressed between short and prolonged heat treatments.


CONCLUSIONS
the differences in heat tolerance in different wheat genotypes may be associated with multiple processes and mechanisms involving hsps, transcription factors, and other stress related genes. heat acclimation has little effects on gene expression under prolonged treatments but affects gene expression in wheat under short-term heat stress. the heat stress responsive genes identified in this study will facilitate our understanding of molecular basis for heat tolerance in different wheat genotypes and future improvement of heat tolerance in wheat and other cereals.
