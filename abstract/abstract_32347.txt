BACKGROUND
systems biology approaches offer novel insights into the development of chronic liver diseases. current genomic databases supporting systems biology analyses are mostly based on microarray data. although these data often cover genome wide expression, the validity of single microarray experiments remains questionable. however, for systems biology approaches addressing the interactions of molecular networks comprehensive but also highly validated data are necessary.


RESULTS
we have therefore generated the first comprehensive database for published molecular associations in human liver diseases. it is based on pubmed published abstracts and aimed to close the gap between genome wide coverage of low validity from microarray data and individual highly validated data from pubmed. after an initial text mining process, the extracted abstracts were all manually validated to confirm content and potential genetic associations and may therefore be highly trusted. all data were stored in a publicly available database, library of molecular associations http://www.medicalgenomics.org/databases/loma/news, currently holding approximately  <dig> confirmed molecular associations for chronic liver diseases such as hcc, ccc, liver fibrosis, nash/fatty liver disease, aih, pbc, and psc. we furthermore transformed these data into a powerful resource for molecular liver research by connecting them to multiple biomedical information resources.


CONCLUSIONS
together, this database is the first available database providing a comprehensive view and analysis options for published molecular associations on multiple liver diseases.
