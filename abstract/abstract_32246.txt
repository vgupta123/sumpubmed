BACKGROUND
 <dig> -methylenedioxymethamphetamine  is known for its toxicological, psychopathological and abuse potential. some environmental conditions, e.g. acoustic stimulation typical of the "rave scene" can influence the toxicity of this drug.


RESULTS
we investigated the effects of low doses of mdma in vivo using wistar rats in the absence of acoustic stimulation  demonstrating that ecstasy is able to induce a significant activation  of the telencephalic cortex that spontaneously reverts in the absence of sensorial stimuli, whereas it persists for several days if, in addition to mdma, the animals are exposed to acoustic stimulation.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate that low doses of mdma are able to reduce electrocortical total power, and that this effect is potentiated by sensorial stimuli commonly present in certain environments, such as rave parties.
