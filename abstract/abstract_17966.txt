BACKGROUND
candida species are the most common cause of opportunistic fungal infection worldwide. recent sequencing efforts have provided a wealth of candida genomic data. we have developed the candida gene order browser , an online tool that aids comparative syntenic analyses of candida species. cgob incorporates all available candida clade genome sequences including two candida albicans isolates  and  <dig> closely related species . saccharomyces cerevisiae is also included as a reference genome.


RESULTS
cgob assignments of homology were manually curated based on sequence similarity and synteny. in total cgob includes  <dig> genes arranged into  <dig> homology columns. we have also generated improved candida gene sets by merging/removing partial genes in each genome. interrogation of cgob revealed that the majority of tandemly duplicated genes are under strong purifying selection in all candida species. we identified clusters of adjacent genes involved in the same metabolic pathways  and we showed that some clusters are species or lineage-specific. we also identified one example of intron gain in c. albicans.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis provides an important resource that is now available for the candida community. cgob is available at http://cgob.ucd.ie.
