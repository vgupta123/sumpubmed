BACKGROUND
the neonatal fc receptor  plays a crucial role in transporting igg and associated antigens across polarized epithelial barriers in mucosal immunity. however, it was not clear that fcrn expression in aggregated lymphoid nodules area  in abomasum, a unique and important mucosal immune structure discovered only in bactrian camels. in the present study,  <dig> alashan bactrian camels were divided into the following five age groups: fetus , young , pubertal , middle-aged  and old . the fcrn expressions were observed and analyzed in detail with histology, immunohistochemistry, micro-image analysis and statistical methods.


RESULTS
the results showed that the fcrn was expressed in mucosal epithelial cells of alna from the fetus to the old group, although the expression level rapidly declined in old group; moreover, after the alna maturated, the fcrn expression level in the non-follicle-associated epithelium  was significantly higher than that in fae . in addition, the fcrn was also expressed in the vessel endothelium, smooth muscle tissue, and macrophages and dendritic cells  of secondary lymphoid follicles .


CONCLUSIONS
it was demonstrated that fcrn was mainly expressed in non-fae, the effector sites, although which was expressed in fae, the inductive sites for mucosal immunity. and it was also expressed in dcs and macrophages in slfs of all ages of bactrian camels. the results provided a powerful evidence that igg  could participate in mucosal immune response and tolerance in alna of bactrian camels through fcrn transmembrane transport.
