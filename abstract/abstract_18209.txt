BACKGROUND
enterohaemorrhagic e. coli  can cause severe disease such as bloody diarrhoea and haemolytic uraemic syndrome in humans. besides production of shiga toxins, the presence of lee  and non-lee  encoded effector genes harboured on o-islands oi- <dig>  oi- <dig> and oi- <dig> is associated with ehec virulence and their frequency in outbreaks. genes encoded by the ehec-plasmid are putative virulence markers of ehec. ehec-plasmids, lee and non-lee effector genes have also been detected in some strains of enteropathogenic e. coli . the objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between ehec and epec for virulence genes encoded by genomic o-islands and by the ehec-plasmids.


RESULTS
nle genes ent/espl <dig>  nleb and nlee , nlea, nlef and nleh1- <dig> , nleg5- <dig> and nleg6- <dig> , espk  and the ehec-plasmid encoded genes ehxa, espp, etpd and katp were searched in  <dig> typical and in  <dig> atypical enteropathogenic e. coli  strains. typical and atypical epec each fall into two clusters. cluster  <dig> typical  and atypical  epec strains were characterized by the presence of oi- <dig> encoded genes and grouped together with  <dig> investigated ehec strains. cluster  <dig> typical  and atypical  strains grouped together with  <dig> lee-negative, shiga toxin-producing e. coli  and with  <dig> apathogenic e. coli strains. typical epec cluster  <dig> strains belonged to serotypes frequently involved in severe illness and outbreaks in children . atypical epec cluster  <dig> strains were characterized by serotypes related to ehec .


CONCLUSIONS
the oi- <dig> encoded nleb gene was found to be most closely associated with cluster  <dig> strains and may serve as a diagnostic tool for the identification of virulent ehec and epec seropathotypes. oi- <dig> encoded genes nlea, nlef and nleh1- <dig> are less associated with cluster  <dig> strains. ehec-plasmid, oi- <dig> and cp- <dig> associated genes showed only weak similarities with virulent cluster  <dig> ehec and epec strains.
