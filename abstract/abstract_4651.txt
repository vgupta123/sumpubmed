BACKGROUND
members of the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor  gene family, particularly pitx <dig> and pitx <dig>  play important roles in normal development and in differentiated cell functions. three major isoforms of pitx <dig> were previously reported to be produced through both alternative mrna splicing  and alternative promoter usage . the proteins derived from these mrnas contain identical homeodomain and carboxyl termini. differences in the amino-termini of the proteins may confer functional differences in some contexts.


RESULTS
here, we report the identification of two novel pitx <dig> isoforms. first, we demonstrate that the pitx2c mrna generates two protein products, pitx2cα and pitx2cβ, via alternative translation initiation. second, we identified a novel mrna splice variant, pitx2b <dig>  which uses the same 5' splice donor in intron  <dig> as pitx2b , but employs an alternative 3' splice acceptor, leading to an in-frame deletion of  <dig> base pairs relative to pitx2b <dig>  pitx2b <dig> mrna is expressed in both murine and human pituitary. the data show that in a murine gonadotrope cell line and adult murine pituitary what was previously thought to be pitx2b <dig> is actually pitx2cβ, or perhaps pitx2b <dig>  pitx2b <dig> is expressed at lower levels than previously thought. pitx2cβ and pitx2b <dig> activate gonadotrope-specific gene promoter-reporters similarly to known pitx <dig> isoforms.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified and characterized two novel isoforms of pitx <dig>  generated by alternative translation initiation  and alternative mrna splicing . these proteins show similar dna binding and trans-activation functions as other pitx <dig> isoforms in vitro, though their conservation across species suggests that they may play distinct, as yet unidentified, roles in vivo.
