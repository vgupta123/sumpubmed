BACKGROUND
pollen of common ragweed  is a main cause of allergic diseases in northern america. the weed has recently become spreading as a neophyte in europe, while climate change may also affect the growth of the plant and additionally may also influence pollen allergenicity. to gain better insight in the molecular mechanisms in the development of ragweed pollen and its allergenic proteins under global change scenarios, we generated supersage libraries to identify differentially expressed transcripts.


RESULTS
ragweed plants were grown in a greenhouse under 380Â ppm co <dig> and under elevated level of co <dig> . in addition, drought experiments under both co <dig> concentrations were performed. the pollen viability was not altered under elevated co <dig>  whereas drought stress decreased its viability. increased levels of individual flavonoid metabolites were found under elevated co <dig> and/or drought. total rna was isolated from ragweed pollen, exposed to the four mentioned scenarios and four supersage libraries were constructed. the library dataset included  <dig>  unique sequences, showing overlapping as well as clear differently expressed sequence tags . the analysis targeted ests known in ambrosia, as well as in pollen of other plants. among the identified ests, those encoding allergenic ragweed proteins  increased under elevated co <dig> and drought stress. in addition, ests encoding allergenic proteins in other plants were also identified.


CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of changes in the transcriptome of ragweed pollen upon co <dig> and drought stress using supersage indicates that under global change scenarios the pollen transcriptome was altered, and impacts the allergenic potential of ragweed pollen.
