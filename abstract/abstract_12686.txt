BACKGROUND
the arbuscular mycorrhizal  symbiosis consists of a mutualistic relationship between soil fungi and roots of most plant species. this association provides the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus with sugars while the fungus improves the uptake of water and mineral nutrients in the host plant. then, the establishment of the arbuscular mycorrhizal  symbiosis requires the fine tuning of host gene expression for recognition and accommodation of the fungal symbiont. in plants, calcium plays a key role as second messenger during developmental processes and responses to environmental stimuli. even though calcium transients are known to occur in host cells during the am symbiosis, the decoding of the calcium signal and the molecular events downstream are only poorly understood.


RESULTS
the expression of seventeen calcium-dependent protein kinase  genes representative of the four distinct phylogenetic groups of rice cpks was monitored during the presymbiotic phase of the am symbiosis. among them, oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig>  were found to be transcriptionally activated in response to inoculation with the am fungus glomus intraradices. oscpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> gene expression was also up-regulated by fungal-produced diffusible molecules. laser microdissection revealed expression of oscpk <dig> in cortical cells, and not in epidermal cells of g. intraradices-inoculated rice roots, suggesting a preferential role of this gene in the root cortex. moreover, a plasma membrane localization of oscpk <dig> was observed by transient expression assays of green fluorescent protein-tagged oscpk <dig> in onion epidermal cells. we also show that the myristoylation site of the oscpk <dig> n-terminus is required for plasma membrane targeting.


CONCLUSIONS
the rapid activation of oscpk <dig> expression in response to am inoculation, its expression being also induced by fungal-secreted signals, together with the observed plasma membrane localization of oscpk <dig>  points to a role for oscpk <dig> in perception of the am fungus. the oscpk <dig> gene might be considered as a marker for the presymbiotic phase of the symbiotic process. these findings provide a better understanding of the signaling mechanisms operating during the am symbiosis and will greatly facilitate their molecular dissection.
