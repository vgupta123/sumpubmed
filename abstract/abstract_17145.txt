BACKGROUND
the cucurbitaceae genus trichosanthes comprises 90– <dig> species that occur from india to japan and southeast to australia and fiji. most species have large white or pale yellow petals with conspicuously fringed margins, the fringes sometimes several cm long. pollination is usually by hawkmoths. previous molecular data for a small number of species suggested that a monophyletic trichosanthes might include the asian genera gymnopetalum  and hodgsonia . here we test these groups’ relationships using a species sampling of c. 60% and  <dig> nucleotides of nuclear and plastid dna. to infer the time and direction of the geographic expansion of the trichosanthes clade we employ molecular clock dating and statistical biogeographic reconstruction, and we also address the gain or loss of petal fringes.


RESULTS
trichosanthes is monophyletic as long as it includes gymnopetalum, which itself is polyphyletic. the closest relative of trichosanthes appears to be the sponge gourds, luffa, while hodgsonia is more distantly related. of six morphology-based sections in trichosanthes with more than one species, three are supported by the molecular results; two new sections appear warranted. molecular dating and biogeographic analyses suggest an oligocene origin of trichosanthes in eurasia or east asia, followed by diversification and spread throughout the malesian biogeographic region and into the australian continent.


CONCLUSIONS
long-fringed corollas evolved independently in hodgsonia and trichosanthes, followed by two losses in the latter coincident with shifts to other pollinators but not with long-distance dispersal events. together with the caribbean linnaeosicyos, the madagascan ampelosicyos and the tropical african telfairia, these cucurbit lineages represent an ideal system for more detailed studies of the evolution and function of petal fringes in plant-pollinator mutualisms.
