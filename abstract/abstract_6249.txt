BACKGROUND
prion diseases are characterised by a neurodegenerative pattern in which the function of immune system remains still elusive. in the present study, we evaluate if an exogenous treatment with interleukin- <dig>  and il- <dig>  able to activate microglia, is able to affect scrapie pathogenesis.


RESULTS
cytokines injected intracranially, induced a strong inflammatory response characterised by tnf-Î± production and microglia activation. two groups of mice were injected intracerebrally with high dose of me <dig> strain of scrapie containing il- <dig> and il- <dig> or sterile saline. cytokines-treated mice showed a more pronounced accumulation of prpsc in brain tissues at  <dig> days post-inoculation and a shorter mean survival times than untreated mice.


CONCLUSIONS
we can conclude that intracerebral administration of il- <dig> and il- <dig> can modulate scrapie pathogenesis possibly through a microglia-mediated pattern.
