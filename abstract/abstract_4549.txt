BACKGROUND
alzheimer's disease  is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that affects a large and growing number of elderly individuals. in addition to idiopathic disease, ad is also associated with autosomal dominant inheritance, which causes a familial form of ad . some instances of fad have been linked to mutations in the β-amyloid protein precursor . although there are numerous mouse ad models available, few rat ad models, which have several advantages over mice, have been generated.


RESULTS
fischer  <dig> rats expressing human app driven by the ubiquitin-c promoter were generated via lentiviral vector infection of fischer  <dig> zygotes. we generated two separate app-transgenic rat lines, app <dig> and app <dig>  serum levels of human amyloid-beta  <dig> were  <dig> pg/ml for hemizygous and  <dig> pg/ml for homozygous app <dig> animals. serum aβ <dig> levels in app <dig> homozygous rats were  <dig> pg/ml. immunohistochemistry in brain showed that the human app transgene was expressed in neurons, but not in glial cells. these findings were consistent with independent examination of enhanced green fluorescent protein  in the brains of egfp-transgenic rats. app <dig> and app <dig> rats expressed  <dig> - and 3-times more app mrna, respectively, than did wild-type rats. northern blots showed that the human app transgene, driven by the ubiquitin-c promoter, is expressed significantly more in brain, kidney and lung compared to heart and liver. a similar expression pattern was also seen for the endogenous rat app. the unexpected similarity in the tissue-specific expression patterns of endogenous rat app and transgenic human app mrnas suggests regulatory elements within the cdna sequence of app.


CONCLUSIONS
this manuscript describes the generation of app-transgenic inbred fischer  <dig> rats. these are the first human ad model rat lines generated by lentiviral infection. the app <dig> rat line expresses high levels of human app and could be a useful model for ad. tissue-specific expression in the two transgenic rat lines and in wild-type rats contradicts our current understanding of app gene regulation. determination of the elements that are responsible for tissue-specific expression of app may enable new treatment options for ad.
