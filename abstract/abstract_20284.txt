BACKGROUND
ccn2/ctgf is an established effector of tgfβ driven responses in diabetic nephropathy. we have identified an interaction between ccn <dig> and tgfβ leading to altered phenotypic differentiation and inhibited cellular migration. here we determine the gene expression profile associated with this phenotype and define a transcriptional basis for differential actin related gene expression and cytoskeletal function.


RESULTS
from a panel of genes regulated by tgfβ and ccn <dig>  we used co-inertia analysis to identify and then experimentally verify a subset of transcription factors, e2f <dig> and creb, that regulate an expression fingerprint implicated in altered actin dynamics and cell hypertrophy. importantly, actin related genes containing e2f <dig> and creb binding sites, stratified by expression profile within the dataset. further analysis of actin and cytoskeletal related genes from patients with diabetic nephropathy suggests recapitulation of this programme during the development of renal disease. the rho family member cdc <dig> was also found uniquely to be activated in cells treated with tgfβ and ccn2; cdc <dig> interacting genes were differentially regulated in diabetic nephropathy.


CONCLUSIONS
tgfβ and ccn <dig> attenuate creb and augment e2f <dig> transcriptional activation with the likely effect of altering actin cytoskeletal and cell growth/hypertrophic gene activity with implications for cell dysfunction in diabetic kidney disease. the cytoskeletal regulator cdc <dig> may play a role in this signalling response.
