BACKGROUND
mathematical optimization aims to make a system or design as effective or functional as possible, computing the quality of the different alternatives using a mathematical model. most models in systems biology have a dynamic nature, usually described by sets of differential equations. dynamic optimization addresses this class of systems, seeking the computation of the optimal time-varying conditions  to minimize or maximize a certain performance index. dynamic optimization can solve many important problems in systems biology, including optimal control for obtaining a desired biological performance, the analysis of network designs and computer aided design of biological units.


RESULTS
here, we present a software toolbox, dotcvpsb, which uses a rich ensemble of state-of-the-art numerical methods for solving continuous and mixed-integer dynamic optimization  problems. the toolbox has been written in matlab and provides an easy and user friendly environment, including a graphical user interface, while ensuring a good numerical performance. problems are easily stated thanks to the compact input definition. the toolbox also offers the possibility of importing sbml models, thus enabling it as a powerful optimization companion to modelling packages in systems biology. it serves as a means of handling generic black-box models as well.


CONCLUSIONS
here we illustrate the capabilities and performance of dotcvpsb by solving several challenging optimization problems related with bioreactor optimization, optimal drug infusion to a patient and the minimization of intracellular oscillations. the results illustrate how the suite of solvers available allows the efficient solution of a wide class of dynamic optimization problems, including challenging multimodal ones. the toolbox is freely available for academic use.
