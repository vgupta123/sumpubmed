BACKGROUND
outbreaks of the casuarina moth, lymantria xylina swinehoe , which is a very important forest pest in taiwan, have occurred every five to  <dig> years. this moth has expanded its range of host plants to include more than  <dig> species of broadleaf trees. lyxymnpv  is highly virulent to the casuarina moth and has been investigated as a possible biopesticide for controlling this moth. ldmnpv-like virus has also been isolated from lymantria xylina larvae but lyxymnpv was more virulent than ldmnpv-like virus both in ntu-ly and iplb-ld-652y cell lines. to better understand lyxymnpv, the nucleotide sequence of the lyxymnpv dna genome was determined and analysed.


RESULTS
the genome of lyxymnpv consists of  <dig>  bases, has a g+c content of  <dig> % and contains  <dig> putative open reading frames . the gene content and gene order of lyxymnpv were similar to those of ldmnpv, with  <dig> orfs identified as homologous to those reported in the ldmnpv genome. two genes  were homologous to other baculoviruses, and four unique lyxymnpv orfs  were identified in the lyxymnpv genome, including a gag-like gene that was not reported in baculoviruses. ldmnpv contains  <dig> orfs that are absent in lyxymnpv. readily identifiable homologues of the gene host range factor- <dig> , which appears to be involved in the susceptibility of l. dispar to npv infection, were not present in lyxymnpv. additionally, two putative odv-e <dig> homologues were identified in lyxymnpv. the lyxymnpv genome encoded  <dig> bro genes compared with  <dig> in ldmnpv, which occupied more than 8% of the lyxymnpv genome. thirteen homologous regions  were identified containing  <dig> repeated sequences composed of 30-bp imperfect palindromes. however, they differed in the relative positions, number of repeats and orientation in the genome compared to ldmnpv.


CONCLUSIONS
the gene parity plot analysis, percent identity of the gene homologues and a phylogenetic analysis suggested that lyxymnpv is a group ii npv that is most closely related to ldmnpv but with a highly distinct genomic organisation.
