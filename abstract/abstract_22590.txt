BACKGROUND
immune-mediated rejection of labeled cells is a general problem in transplantation studies using cells labeled with any immunogenic marker, and also in gene therapy protocols. the aim of this study was to establish a syngeneic model for long-term histological cell tracking in the absence of immune-mediated rejection of labeled cells in immunocompetent animals. we used inbred transgenic fischer  <dig> rats expressing human placental alkaline phosphatase  under the control of the ubiquitous r <dig> promoter for this study. hplap is an excellent marker enzyme, providing superb histological detection quality in paraffin and plastic sections.


RESULTS
transplantation of cells from hplap transgenic  f <dig> rats into wild-type  f <dig> recipients failed because of immune-mediated rejection. here we show that this problem can be overcome by inducing tolerance to the marker gene by transplantation of bone marrow from hplap-tg f <dig> rats into wt f <dig> hosts after lethal irradiation, or by neonatal exposure of wt f <dig> rats to hplap-tg f <dig> cells. as proof-of-principle, we injected bone marrow cells  from hplap-tg rats into the knee joint of marker tolerant, bone marrow-transplanted wt rats, and found successful engraftment and differentiation of donor cells. in addition, hplap-tg bmc injected intravenously in neonatally tolerized wt f <dig> hosts could be traced in lymph nodes,  <dig> months post-injection.


CONCLUSIONS
in combination with the excellent marker hplap, marker tolerant animals may open up new perspectives for all experiments requiring long-term histological tracking of genetically labeled cells.
