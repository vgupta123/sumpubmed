BACKGROUND
the highly homologous pe_pgrs  genes are members of the pe multigene family which is found only in mycobacteria. pe genes are particularly abundant within the genomes of pathogenic mycobacteria where they seem to have expanded as a result of gene duplication events. pe_pgrs genes are characterized by their high gc content and extensive repetitive sequences, making them prone to recombination events and genetic variability.


RESULTS
comparative sequence analysis of mycobacterium tuberculosis genes pe_pgrs <dig>  and pe_pgrs <dig>  revealed a striking genetic variation associated with this typical tandem duplicate. in comparison to the m. tuberculosis reference strain h37rv, the variation  consists of an in-frame 12-bp insertion invariably accompanied by a set of  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  that occurs either in pe_pgrs <dig> or in both genes. sequence analysis of the paralogous genes in a representative set of worldwide distributed tubercle bacilli isolates revealed data which supported previously proposed evolutionary scenarios for the m. tuberculosis complex  and confirmed the very ancient origin of "m. canettii" and other smooth tubercle bacilli. strikingly, the identified polymorphism appears to be coincident with the emergence of the post-bottleneck successful clone from which the mtbc expanded. furthermore, the findings provide direct and clear evidence for the natural occurrence of gene conversion in mycobacteria, which appears to be restricted to modern m. tuberculosis strains.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a new perspective to explore the molecular events that accompanied the evolution, clonal expansion, and recent diversification of tubercle bacilli.
