BACKGROUND
mobile elements are involved in genomic rearrangements and virulence acquisition, and hence, are important elements in bacterial genome evolution. the insertion of some specific insertion sequences had been associated with repetitive extragenic palindromic  elements. considering that there are a sufficient number of available genomes with described reps, and exploiting the advantage of the traceability of transposition events in genomes, we decided to exhaustively analyze the relationship between rep sequences and mobile elements.


RESULTS
this global multigenome study highlights the importance of repetitive extragenic palindromic elements as target sequences for transposases. the study is based on the analysis of the dna regions surrounding the  <dig> instances of insertion sequence elements with respect to the positioning of rep sequences in the  <dig> available annotated microbial genomes corresponding to species of bacteria with reported rep sequences. this analysis has allowed the detection of the specific insertion into rep sequences for ispsy <dig> in pseudomonas syringae dc <dig>  ispa <dig> in p. aeruginosa pa <dig>  isppu <dig> and isppu <dig> in p. putida kt <dig>  and isrm <dig> and isrm <dig> in sinorhizobium meliloti  <dig> genome. preference for insertion in extragenic spaces with rep sequences has also been detected for ispsy <dig> in p. syringae dc <dig>  isrm <dig> in s. meliloti and isnm <dig> in neisseria meningitidis mc <dig> and z <dig> genomes. probably, the association with rep elements that we have detected analyzing genomes is only the tip of the iceberg, and this association could be even more frequent in natural isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings characterize rep elements as hot spots for transposition and reinforce the relationship between rep sequences and genomic plasticity mediated by mobile elements. in addition, this study defines a subset of rep-recognizer transposases with high target selectivity that can be useful in the development of new tools for genome manipulation.
