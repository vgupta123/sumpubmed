BACKGROUND
fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici  is one of the most destructive necrotrophic pathogens affecting tomato crops, causing considerable field and greenhouse yield losses. despite such major economic impact, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici resistance in tomato.


RESULTS
a transcriptomic experiment was carried out in order to investigate the main mechanisms of forl response in resistant and susceptible isogenic tomato lines. microarray analysis at  <dig> dpi  revealed a distinct gene expression pattern between the two genotypes in the inoculated vs non-inoculated conditions. a model of plant response both for compatible and incompatible reactions was proposed. in particular, in the incompatible interaction an activation of defense genes related to secondary metabolite production and tryptophan metabolism was observed. moreover, maintenance of the cell osmotic potential after the forl challenging was mediated by a dehydration-induced protein. as for the compatible interaction, activation of an oxidative burst mediated by peroxidases and a cytochrome monooxygenase induced cell degeneration and necrosis.


CONCLUSIONS
our work allowed comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of the tomato-forl interaction. the result obtained emphasizes a different transcriptional reaction between the resistant and the susceptible genotype to the forl challenge. our findings could lead to the improvement in disease control strategies.
