BACKGROUND
coxiella burnetii causes q fever in humans and coxiellosis in animals; symptoms range from general malaise to fever, pneumonia, endocarditis and death. livestock are a significant source of human infection as they shed c. burnetii cells in birth tissues, milk, urine and feces. although prevalence of c. burnetii is high, few q fever cases are reported in the u.s. and we have a limited understanding of their connectedness due to difficulties in genotyping. here, we develop canonical snp genotyping assays to evaluate spatial and temporal relationships among c. burnetii environmental samples and compare them across studies. given the genotypic diversity of historical collections, we hypothesized that the current enzootic of coxiellosis is caused by multiple circulating genotypes. we collected a)  <dig> milk samples from a single bovine herd, b)  <dig> commercial bovine and caprine milk samples from across the u.s., and c)  <dig> bovine and caprine samples from six milk processing plants over three years.


RESULTS
we detected c. burnetii dna in 96% of samples with no variance over time. we genotyped  <dig> % of positive samples; bovine milk contained only a single genotype  and caprine milk was dominated by a second type .


CONCLUSIONS
the high prevalence and lack of genotypic diversity is consistent with a model of rapid spread and persistence. the segregation of genotypes between host species is indicative of species-specific adaptations or dissemination barriers and may offer insights into the relative lack of human cases and characterizing genotypes.
