BACKGROUND
dystonia is often currently treated with botulinum toxin injections to spastic muscles, or deep brain stimulation to the basal ganglia. in addition to these pharmacological or neurosurgical measures, a new noninvasive treatment concept, functional modulation using a brain-computer interface, was tested for feasibility. we recorded electroencephalograms  over the bilateral sensorimotor cortex from a patient suffering from chronic writer’s cramp. the patient was asked to suppress an exaggerated beta frequency component in the eeg during hand extension.


RESULTS
the patient completed biweekly one-hour training for 5 months without any adverse effects. significant decrease of the beta frequency component during handwriting was confirmed, and was associated with clear functional improvement.


CONCLUSIONS
the current pilot study suggests that a brain-computer interface can give explicit feedback of ongoing cortical excitability to patients with dystonia and allow them to suppress exaggerated neural activity, resulting in functional recovery.
