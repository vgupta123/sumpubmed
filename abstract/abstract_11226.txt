BACKGROUND
several research applications involving platelets, such as proteomic and transcriptomic analysis, require samples with very low numbers of contaminating leukocytes, which have considerably higher rna and protein content than platelets. we sought to develop a platelet purification protocol that would minimize contamination, involve minimal centrifugation steps, and yield highly pure platelet samples derived from low volume whole blood samples from healthy dogs.


RESULTS
using an optimized optiprep density gradient technique, platelet recovery was  <dig> % with  <dig> % platelet purity and leukocyte contamination of  <dig> leukocytes per  <dig> platelets, on average. platelet samples were subjected to additional purification with cd45-labeled dynabeads after density barrier centrifugation resulting in a 95-fold depletion of residual leukocytes. platelets purified using these methods remained inactivated as assessed by annexin v and p-selectin labeling with flow cytometry.


CONCLUSIONS
the use of optiprep density gradient is a quick method for obtaining highly purified platelet samples from low volumes of canine whole blood with minimal contamination. additional depletion of residual leukocytes can be achieved using cd45-labeled beads. these platelet samples can then be used for many downstream applications that require ultra-pure platelet samples such as rna and protein analysis.
