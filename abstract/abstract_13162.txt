BACKGROUND
the habenula and the thalamus are two critical nodes in the forebrain circuitry and they connect the midbrain and the cerebral cortex in vertebrates. the habenula is derived from the epithalamus and rests dorsally to the thalamus. both epithalamus and thalamus arise from a single diencephalon segment called prosomere  <dig>  shh is expressed in the ventral midline of the neural tube and in the mid-diencephalic organizer  at the zona limitans intrathalamica between thalamus and prethalamus. acting as a morphogen, shh plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation and survival in the diencephalon and thalamic patterning. the molecular regulation of the mdo shh expression and the potential role of shh in development of the habenula remain largely unclear.


RESULTS
we show that deleting paired-box and homeobox-containing gene pax <dig> results in precocious and expanded expression of shh in the prospective mdo in fish and mice, whereas gain-of-function of pax <dig> inhibits mdo shh expression in fish. using gene expression and genetic fate mapping, we have characterized the expression of molecular markers that demarcate the progenitors and precursors of habenular neurons. we show that the thalamic domain is shifted dorsally and the epithalamus is missing in the alar plate of p <dig> in the pax <dig> mutant mouse. conversely, the epithalamus is expanded ventrally at the expense of the thalamus in mouse embryos with reduced shh activity. significantly, attenuating shh signaling largely rescues the patterning of p <dig> and restores the epithalamus in pax <dig> mouse mutants, suggesting that shh acts downstream of pax <dig> in controlling the formation of the habenula. similar to that found in the mouse, we show that pax <dig> controls the formation of the epithalamus mostly via the regulation of mdo shh expression in zebrafish.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings demonstrate that pax <dig> has an evolutionarily conserved function in establishing the temporospatial expression of shh in the mdo in vertebrates. furthermore, shh mediates pax <dig> function in regulating the partition of the p <dig> domain into the epithalamus and thalamus.
