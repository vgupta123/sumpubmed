BACKGROUND
striatin, a putative protein phosphatase 2a  b-type regulatory subunit, is a multi-domain scaffolding protein that has recently been linked to several diseases including cerebral cavernous malformation , which causes symptoms ranging from headaches to stroke. striatin association with the pp2a a/c  heterodimer alters pp2a substrate specificity, but targets and roles of striatin-associated pp2a are not known. in addition to binding the pp2a a/c heterodimer to form a pp2a holoenzyme, striatin associates with cerebral cavernous malformation  <dig>  protein, the mammalian mps one binder  homolog, mob3/phocein, the mammalian sterile 20-like  kinases, mst <dig>  mst <dig> and stk <dig>  and several other proteins to form a large signaling complex. little is known about the molecular architecture of the striatin complex and the regulation of these sterile 20-like kinases.


RESULTS
to help define the molecular organization of striatin complexes and to determine whether mst <dig> might be negatively regulated by striatin-associated pp2a, a structure-function analysis of striatin was performed. two distinct regions of striatin are capable of stably binding directly or indirectly to mob3--one n-terminal, including the coiled-coil domain, and another more c-terminal, including the wd-repeat domain. in addition, striatin residues 191- <dig> contain determinants necessary for efficient association of mst <dig>  mst <dig>  and ccm <dig>  pp2a associates with the coiled-coil domain of striatin, but unlike mob <dig> and mst <dig>  its binding appears to require striatin oligomerization. deletion of the caveolin-binding domain on striatin abolishes striatin family oligomerization and pp2a binding. point mutations in striatin that disrupt pp2a association cause hyperphosphorylation and activation of striatin-associated mst <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
striatin orchestrates the regulation of mst <dig> by pp2a. it binds mst <dig> likely as a dimer with ccm <dig> via residues lying between striatin's calmodulin-binding and wd-domains and recruits the pp2a a/c heterodimer to its coiled-coil/oligomerization domain. residues outside the previously reported coiled-coil domain of striatin are necessary for its oligomerization. striatin-associated pp2a is critical for mst <dig> dephosphorylation and inactivation. upon inhibition of pp2a, mst <dig> activation appears to involve autophosphorylation of multiple activation loop phosphorylation sites. mob <dig> can associate with striatin sequences c-terminal to the mst <dig> binding site but also with sequences proximal to striatin-associated pp2a, consistent with a possible role for mob  <dig> in the regulation of mst <dig> by pp2a.
