BACKGROUND
at present, six accessible sequences of 16s rdna from taylorella equigenitalis  are available, whose sequence differences occur at a few nucleotide positions. thus it is important to determine these sequences from additional strains in other countries, if possible, in order to clarify any anomalies regarding 16s rdna sequence heterogeneity. here, we clone and sequence the approximate full-length 16s rdna from additional strains of t. equigenitalis isolated in japan, australia and france and compare these sequences to the existing published sequences.


RESULTS
clarification of any anomalies regarding 16s rdna sequence heterogeneity of t. equigenitalis was carried out. when cloning, sequencing and comparison of the approximate full-length 16s rdna from  <dig> strains of t. equigenitalis isolated in japan, australia and france, nucleotide sequence differences were demonstrated at the six loci in the  <dig>  nucleotide sequence. moreover,  <dig> polymorphic sites occurred among  <dig> sequences of the 16s rdna, including the six reference sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
high sequence similarity  was observed throughout, except from nucleotide positions  <dig> to  <dig> where substitutions and deletions were noted.
