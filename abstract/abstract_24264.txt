BACKGROUND
amplification of single-stranded dna circles has wide utility for a variety of applications. the two-primer ramified rolling circle amplification  reaction provides exponential dna amplification under isothermal conditions, creating a regular laddered series of double-stranded dna products. however, the molecular mechanism of the ram reaction remains unexplained.


RESULTS
a ram reaction model predicts exponential accumulation of a double-stranded dna product size series, and product-size ratios, that are consistent with observed ram reaction products. the mechanism involves generation of a series of increasing size intermediate templates; those templates produce ram products and recursively generate smaller intermediate templates. the model allows prediction of the number of rounds of circular template replication. real-time ram reaction data are consistent with the model. analysis of ram reaction products shows exponential growth limitation consistent with the model's predictions.


CONCLUSIONS
the model provides a rationale for the observed products of the ram reaction, and the molecular yield among those products. experimental results are consistent with the model.
