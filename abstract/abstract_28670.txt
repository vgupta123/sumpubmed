BACKGROUND
genes belonging to the pathogenesis related  <dig>  group have been studied in several plant species, where they form multigene families. until now, such an analysis has not been performed in vitis vinifera, although three different pr <dig> genes were found to be expressed under pathogen attack or abiotic stress, and during somatic embryogenesis induction. we used the complete genome sequence for characterising the whole v. vinifera pr <dig> gene family. the expression of candidate genes was studied in various non-treated tissues and following somatic embryogenesis induction by the auxin  <dig> -d.


RESULTS
in addition to the three v. vinifera pr <dig> genes already described, namely vvpr <dig> , vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig> , fourteen different pr <dig> related sequences were identified. showing high similarity, they form a single cluster on the chromosome  <dig> comprising three pseudogenes. the expression of nine different genes was detected in various tissues. although differentially expressed in non-treated plant organs, several genes were up-regulated in tissues treated with  <dig> -d, as expected for pr genes.


CONCLUSIONS
pr <dig> genes form a multigene family in v. vinifera, as found in birch, apple or peach. seventeen closely related pr <dig> sequences are arranged in a tandem array on the chromosome  <dig>  probably reflecting small-scale duplications during evolution. various expression patterns were found for nine studied genes, highlighting functional diversification. a phylogenetic comparison of deduced proteins with pr <dig> proteins of other plants showed a characteristic low intraspecific variability. particularly, a group of seven close tandem duplicates including vvpr <dig> , vvpr <dig>  and vvpr <dig>  showed a very high similarity, suggesting concerted evolution or/and recent duplications.
