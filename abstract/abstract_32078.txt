BACKGROUND
because they represent the earliest divergences of the chlorophyta, the morphologically diverse unicellular green algae making up the prasinophytes hold the key to understanding the nature of the first viridiplants and the evolutionary patterns that accompanied the radiation of chlorophytes. nuclear-encoded 18s rdna phylogenies unveiled nine prasinophyte clades  but their branching order is still uncertain. we present here the newly sequenced chloroplast genomes of nephroselmis astigmatica  and of five picoplanktonic species from clade vi  and clade vii . these chloroplast dnas  were compared with those of the six previously sampled prasinophytes  in order to gain information both on the relationships among prasinophyte lineages and on chloroplast genome evolution.


RESULTS
varying from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb in size and encoding  <dig> to  <dig> conserved genes, the cpdnas of the newly investigated picoplanktonic species are substantially smaller than those observed for larger-size prasinophytes, are economically packed and contain a reduced gene content. although the nephroselmis and picocystis cpdnas feature a large inverted repeat encoding the rrna operon, gene partitioning among the single copy regions is remarkably different. unexpectedly, we found that all three species from clade vi  harbor chloroplast genes not previously documented for chlorophytes  and that picocystis contains a trans-spliced group ii intron. the phylogenies inferred from cpdna-encoded proteins are essentially congruent with 18s rdna trees, resolving with robust support all six examined prasinophyte lineages, with the exception of the pycnococcaceae.


CONCLUSIONS
our results underscore the high variability in genome architecture among prasinophyte lineages, highlighting the strong pressure to maintain a small and compact chloroplast genome in picoplanktonic species. the unique set of six chloroplast genes found in the prasinococcales supports the ancestral status of this lineage within the prasinophytes. the widely diverging traits uncovered for the clade-vii members  are consistent with their resolution as separate lineages in the chloroplast phylogeny.
