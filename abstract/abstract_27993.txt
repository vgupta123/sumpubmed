BACKGROUND
carbapenem-resistance in acinetobacter baumannii has gradually become a global challenge. to identify the genes involved in carbapenem resistance in a. baumannii, the transcriptomic responses of the completely sequenced strain atcc  <dig> selected with  <dig>  mg/l  and 2 mg/l  imipenem were investigated using rna-sequencing to identify differences in the gene expression patterns.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> and  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in response to ipm-2 m and ipm-8 m selection, respectively. among the expressed genes,  <dig> genes were highly expressed in ipm-2 m,  <dig> genes were highly expressed in ipm-8 m, and  <dig> genes were expressed common in both strains. six groups of genes were simultaneously expressed in ipm-2 m and ipm-8 m mutants. the three gene groups involved in dna recombination were up-regulated, including recombinase, transposase and dna repair, and beta-lactamase oxa- <dig> and homologous recombination. the remaining gene groups involved in biofilm formation were down-regulated, including quorum sensing, secretion systems, and the csu operon. the antibiotic resistance determinants, including rnd efflux transporters and multidrug resistance pumps, were over-expressed in response to ipm-2 m selection, followed by a decrease in response to ipm-8 m selection. among the genes over-expressed in both strains, blaoxa- <dig>  previously clustered with the blaoxa-51-like family, showed 14-fold  to 330-fold  over-expression. the expression of blaoxa- <dig> in ipm-2 m and ipm-8 m cells was positively correlated with the rate of imipenem hydrolysis, as demonstrated through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry, suggesting that blaoxa- <dig> plays a critical role in conferring carbapenem resistance. in addition, a. baumannii shows an inverse relationship between carbapenem resistance and biofilm production.


CONCLUSIONS
gene recombination and blaoxa- <dig> play critical roles in carbapenem resistance in a. baumannii. taken together, the results of the present study provide a foundation for future studies of the network systems associated with carbapenem resistance.
