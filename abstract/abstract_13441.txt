BACKGROUND
the small g-protein rap <dig> is an important regulator of cellular adhesion in dictyostelium, however so far the downstream signalling pathways for cell adhesion are not completely characterized. in mammalian cells talin is crucial for adhesion and rap <dig> was shown to be a key regulator of talin signalling.


RESULTS
in a proteomic screen we identified talinb as a potential rap <dig> effector in dictyostelium. in subsequent pull-down experiments we demonstrate that the ras association  domain of talinb interacts specifically with active rap <dig>  studies with a mutated ra domain revealed that the ra domain is essential for talinb-rap <dig> interaction, and that this interaction contributes to cell-substrate adhesion during single-celled growth and is crucial for cell-cell adhesion during multicellular development.


CONCLUSIONS
dictyostelium rap <dig> directly binds to talinb via the conserved ra domain. this interaction is critical for adhesion, which becomes essential for high adhesive force demanding processes, like morphogenesis during multicellular development of dictyostelium. in mammalian cells the established rap1-talin interaction is indirect and acts through the scaffold protein - riam. interestingly, direct binding of mouse rap <dig> to the ra domain of talin <dig> has recently been demonstrated.
