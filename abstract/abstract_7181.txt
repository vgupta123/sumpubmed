BACKGROUND
the modeling of dynamic systems requires estimating kinetic parameters from experimentally measured time-courses. conventional global optimization methods used for parameter estimation, e.g. genetic algorithms , consume enormous computational time because they require iterative numerical integrations for differential equations. when the target model is stiff, the computational time for reaching a solution increases further.


RESULTS
in an attempt to solve this problem, we explored a learning technique that uses radial basis function networks  to achieve a parameter estimation for biochemical models. rbfn reduce the number of numerical integrations by replacing derivatives with slopes derived from the distribution of searching points. to introduce a slight search bias, we implemented additional data selection using a ga that searches data-sparse areas at low computational cost. in addition, we adopted logarithmic transformation that smoothes the fitness surface to obtain a solution simply. we conducted numerical experiments to validate our methods and compared the results with those obtained by ga. we found that the calculation time decreased by more than 50% and the convergence rate increased from 60% to 90%.


CONCLUSIONS
in this work, our rbfn technique was effective for parameter optimization of stiff biochemical models.
