BACKGROUND
nutrient availability is a key determinant of eukaryotic cell growth. in unicellular organisms many signaling and transcriptional networks link nutrient availability to the expression of metabolic genes required for growth. however, less is known about the corresponding mechanisms that operate in metazoans. we used gene expression profiling to explore this issue in developing drosophila larvae.


RESULTS
we found that starvation for dietary amino acids  leads to dynamic changes in transcript levels of many metabolic genes. the conserved insulin/pi3k and tor signaling pathways mediate nutrition-dependent growth in drosophila and other animals. we found that many aa starvation-responsive transcripts were also altered in tor mutants. in contrast, although pi3k overexpression induced robust changes in the expression of many metabolic genes, these changes showed limited overlap with the aa starvation expression profile. we did however identify a strong overlap between genes regulated by the transcription factor, myc, and aa starvation-responsive genes, particularly those involved in ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis and mitochondrial function. the consensus myc dna binding site is enriched in promoters of these aa starvation genes, and we found that myc overexpression could bypass dietary aa to induce expression of these genes. we also identified another sequence motif  enriched in the promoters of aa starvation-responsive genes. we showed that motif  <dig> was both necessary and sufficient to mediate transcriptional responses to dietary aa in larvae.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that many of the transcriptional effects of amino acids are mediated via signaling through the tor pathway in drosophila larvae. we also find that these transcriptional effects are mediated through at least two mechanisms: via the transcription factor myc, and via the motif  <dig> cis-regulatory element. these studies begin to elucidate a nutrient-responsive signaling network that controls metabolic gene transcription in drosophila.
