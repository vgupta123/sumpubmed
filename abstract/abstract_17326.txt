BACKGROUND
serotonin  is a well-known modulator of eating behavior. however, the molecular mechanisms linking its action to body weight balance have been only partially elucidated. since platelets are a suitable peripheral model to study 5-ht transport, metabolism and release, we herein evaluated the expression of the platelet 5-ht re-uptake system  by -paroxetine binding assay. a cohort of  <dig> unrelated individuals  without major psychiatric disorders, was recruited following a naturalistic design regarding age or gender and classified accordingly to their body mass index . subjects were divided into  <dig> groups: normal-weight , overweight  and grade i-iii obese  individuals. for gender analyses, data were transformed into -paroxetine density /bmi ratios to overcome both the disparity of women vs. men number and anthropometric differences between sexes.


RESULTS
-paroxetine bmax  was reduced in platelet membranes of grade ii  and iii  obese subjects vs. controls and in overweight subjects  vs. grade iii obese individuals. considering all patients together, a strong negative correlation between bmax and bmi  was demonstrated. conversely, -paroxetine kd  did not differ among groups. no gender-related variation concerning bmax/bmi ratios was observed in this cohort of subjects.


CONCLUSIONS
the down-regulation of sert in platelet membranes of severe human obesity  confirms the involvement of 5-ht system in body weight gain. moreover, this findings may help to elucidate those monoamine-endocrine networks acting on fat storage, adipocyte signaling and energy balance. targeting 5-ht/5-ht-related markers will possibly uncover the existence of human obesity subtypes.
