BACKGROUND
leukocyte ig-like receptors  are a family of innate immune receptors with immunomodulatory functions. high-level expression of the receptors lilrb <dig>  and lilrb <dig>  is a feature of tolerogenic antigen presenting cells and has been observed in cancer and transplant situations. there are relatively few studies regarding these receptors in the context of infection and it is not yet clear how lilrb <dig> exerts its inhibitory effects.


RESULTS
we studied the effects of lilrb <dig> ligation on antigen presenting cell phenotype, and the expression of lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> on salmonella-infected antigen presenting cells. ligation of lilrb <dig> throughout in vitro culture of dendritic cells led to an upregulation of the co-stimulatory protein cd <dig>  alterations in the production of il- <dig> and il- <dig> by lilrb4-ligated macrophages were also observed. infection with salmonella typhimurium or tlr stimulation with salmonella components led to an upregulation of lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the inhibitory effects of lilrb <dig> do not result from a failure to upregulate co-stimulatory proteins. in addition to the high level expression that can render antigen presenting cells tolerogenic, there may be a role for lower level expression and activity of lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> in response to tlr signalling during an immune response to bacterial infection.
