BACKGROUND
leptospira is the causative agent of leptospirosis. the o-antigen is the distal part of the lipopolysaccharide, which is a key component of outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and confers serological specificity. the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of leptospirosis are relative to the serology based taxonomic unit. identification of leptospira strains by serotyping is laborious and has several drawbacks.


RESULTS
in this study, the o-antigen gene clusters of four epidemic leptospira serogroups  in china were sequenced and all genes were predicted in silico. adding published sequences of two serogroups, icterohaemorrhagiae  and sejroe , we identified six o-antigen-specific genes for six epidemic serogroups in china. pcr assays using these genes were developed and tested on  <dig> reference strains and  <dig> clinical isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
the results show that the pcr-based assays can be reliable and alternative means for rapid typing of these six serogroups of leptospira.
