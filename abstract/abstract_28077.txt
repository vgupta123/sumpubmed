BACKGROUND
histoplasma capsulatum and pneumocystis organisms cause host infections primarily affecting the lung tissue. h. capsulatum is endemic in the united states of america and latin american countries. in special environments, h. capsulatum is commonly associated with bat and bird droppings. pneumocystis-host specificity has been primarily studied in laboratory animals, and its ability to be harboured by wild animals remains as an important issue for understanding the spread of this pathogen in nature. bats infected with h. capsulatum or pneumocystis spp. have been found, with this mammal serving as a probable reservoir and disperser; however, the co-infection of bats with both of these microorganisms has never been explored. to evaluate the impact of h. capsulatum and pneumocystis spp. infections in this flying mammal,  <dig> bat lungs from argentina ,  <dig> from french guyana , and  <dig> from mexico  were screened using nested-pcr of the fragments, employing the hcp <dig> locus for h. capsulatum and the mtlsurrna and mtssurrna loci for pneumocystis organisms.


RESULTS
of the  <dig> bats studied,  <dig> revealed h. capsulatum infections in which  <dig> of these bats exhibited this infection alone. in addition,  <dig> bats revealed pneumocystis spp. infection of which eight bats exhibited a pneumocystis infection alone. a total of  <dig> bats  were found co-infected with both fungi, representing a co-infection rate of  <dig> % .


CONCLUSIONS
the data highlights the h. capsulatum and pneumocystis spp.co-infection in bat populationâ€™s suggesting interplay with this wild host.
