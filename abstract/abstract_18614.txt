BACKGROUND
hydrogen bonds  play a key role in both the formation and stabilization of protein structures. they form and break while a protein deforms, for instance during the transition from a non-functional to a functional state. the intrinsic strength of an individual h-bond has been studied from an energetic viewpoint, but energy alone may not be a very good predictor.

methods
this paper describes inductive learning methods to train protein-independent probabilistic models of h-bond stability from molecular dynamics  simulation trajectories of various proteins. the training data contains  <dig> input attributes  that describe an h-bond and its local environment in a conformation c and the output attribute is the probability that the h-bond will be present in an arbitrary conformation of this protein achievable from c within a time duration Δ. we model dependence of the output variable on the predictors by a regression tree.


RESULTS
several models are built using  <dig> md simulation trajectories containing over  <dig> distinct h-bonds . experimental results demonstrate that such models can predict h-bond stability quite well. they perform roughly 20% better than models based on h-bond energy alone. in addition, they can accurately identify a large fraction of the least stable h-bonds in a conformation. in most tests, about 80% of the 10% h-bonds predicted as the least stable are actually among the 10% truly least stable. the important attributes identified during the tree construction are consistent with previous findings.


CONCLUSIONS
we use inductive learning methods to build protein-independent probabilistic models to study h-bond stability, and demonstrate that the models perform better than h-bond energy alone.
