BACKGROUND
the mandarin fish  is an important and widely cultured fish in china. however, the lack of selective breeding of mandarin fish in previous decades has resulted in a decline in the growth rate of pond-cultured fish, a shortened period of sexual maturity, and reduced disease resistance; these issues seriously affect the quality and safety of the fish products. therefore, it is necessary to establish a selective breeding program for the mandarin fish to improve the economical traits of the fish and to sustain the development of the mandarin fish industry.


RESULTS
we constructed a high-density linkage map for it based on double digest restriction site associated dna sequencing . this map contained  <dig> dimorphic single nucleotide polymorphism markers and  <dig> linkage groups . the total map-length was  <dig>  cm, with an average interlocus distance of  <dig>  cm. one significant quantitative trait locus  for sex determination trait was detected on lg <dig>  which was supported by five markers, clustered between  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm. the highest logarithm of odds value  was located at  <dig>  cm, near the marker r1_ <dig>  accounting for  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. genotypes of all the male fish on r1_ <dig> were homozygous, whereas those of all females were heterozygous. thus, lg <dig> was considered a sex-related linkage group. eleven significant qtls, for three growth traits, at two growth stages and the increased values were distributed on four lgs; their contributions to the phenotypic variation were quite low , suggesting that multiple genes affected the growth traits.


CONCLUSIONS
this high-resolution genetic map provides a valuable resource for fine-mapping of important traits and for identification of sex-related markers that should facilitate breeding of all-female mandarin fish for aquaculture and mechanistic studies on sex determination.
