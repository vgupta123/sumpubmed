BACKGROUND
even after years of exploration, the terrestrial origin of bio-molecules remains unsolved and controversial. today, observation of amino acid composition in proteins has become an alternative way for a global understanding of the mystery encoded in whole genomes and seeking clues for the origin of amino acids.


RESULTS
in this study, we statistically monitored the frequencies of  <dig> alpha-amino acids in  <dig> taxa from three kingdoms of life: archaebacteria, eubacteria, and eukaryotes. we found that the amino acids evolved independently in these three kingdoms; but, conserved linkages were observed in two groups of amino acids,  and . moreover, the amino acids encoded by gc-poor codons  were found to "lose" their usage in the development from single cell eukaryotic organisms like s. cerevisiae to h. sapiens, while the amino acids encoded by gc-rich codons  were found to gain usage. these findings further support the co-evolution hypothesis of amino acids and genetic codes.


CONCLUSIONS
we proposed a new chronological order of the appearance of amino acids . two conserved evolutionary paths of amino acids were also suggested: a→g→r→p and k→y.
