BACKGROUND
the escherichia coli uropathogenic-specific protein  is a bacteriocin-like genotoxin, active against mammalian cells and associated with e. coli strains that provoke pyelonephritis, prostatitis and bacteraemia. usp is encoded by a small pathogenicity island with three downstream small open reading frames  that are believed to provide immunity to the producer. to prevent host suicide, colicins, bacteriocins of e. coli, form tight complexes with their cognate immunity proteins. colicin â€“ immunity protein complexes are among the strongest protein complexes known. here, the usp associated immunity protein  <dig>  was partially characterized to gain insight into its role and mechanism of activity.


RESULTS
isolation and partial characterisation of the usp-associated immunity protein- <dig>  revealed that, while usp and imu <dig> do not form a high affinity complex, imu <dig> exhibits dna and rna binding activity. imu <dig> was also shown to protect dna against degradation by colicin e <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our data infer that nonspecific dna binding of the imu <dig> immunity protein, prevents suicide of e. coli producing the genotoxin usp.
