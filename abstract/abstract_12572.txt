BACKGROUND
an important challenge for transcript counting methods such as serial analysis of gene expression , "digital northern" or massively parallel signature sequencing , is to carry out statistical analyses that account for the within-class variability, i.e., variability due to the intrinsic biological differences among sampled individuals of the same class, and not only variability due to technical sampling error.


RESULTS
we introduce a bayesian model that accounts for the within-class variability by means of mixture distribution. we show that the previously available approaches of aggregation in pools  and the beta-binomial model, are particular cases of the mixture model. we illustrate our method with a brain tumor vs. normal comparison using sage data from public databases. we show examples of tags regarded as differentially expressed with high significance if the within-class variability is ignored, but clearly not so significant if one accounts for it.


CONCLUSIONS
using available information about biological replicates, one can transform a list of candidate transcripts showing differential expression to a more reliable one. our method is freely available, under gpl/gnu copyleft, through a user friendly web-based on-line tool or as r language scripts at supplemental web-site.
