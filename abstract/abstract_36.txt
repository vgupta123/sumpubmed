BACKGROUND
trichomes, developed from the protodermal cells , are hair-like structures covering the aerial parts of plants. the genetic network regulating trichome development has been extensively studied and well understood in the model species arabidopsis thaliana, which bears unicellular, non-glandular and branched trichomes. however, little is known about the genetic and molecular basis of organogenesis of multi-cellular trichomes in plant species like cucumber , which are likely different from arabidopsis.


RESULTS
we identified a new trichome mutant in cucumber which exhibited a completely glabrous phenotype on all aerial organs. genetic analysis indicated that the glabrous phenotype was inherited as a single recessive gene, csgl <dig>  fine genetic mapping delimited the csgl <dig> locus into a  <dig>  kb region with  <dig> predicted genes. genetic analysis, sequence alignment and allelic variation survey in natural populations identified csa6g <dig> encoding a class iv homeodomain-associated leucine zipper  transcription factor as the only candidate for csgl <dig>  which was 5188 bp in length with  <dig> predicted exons. gene expression analysis revealed the loss-of-function of csgl <dig> in the mutant due to the insertion of a 5-kb long terminal repeat  retrotransposon in the 4th exon of csgl <dig>  linkage analysis in a segregating population and gene expression analysis of the csgl <dig> and csgl <dig> genes in csgl <dig>  csgl <dig>  and csgl1 +  <dig> genetic backgrounds uncovered interactions between the two genes. phylogenetic analysis among  <dig> class iv hd-zip protein sequences from five species placed cucumber csgl <dig> into the same clade with  <dig> other members that play important roles in trichome initiation.


CONCLUSIONS
the new glabrous mutation in cucumber was controlled by a single recessive locus csgl <dig>  which was phenotypically and genetically distinct from two previously reported glabrous mutants csgl <dig> and csgl <dig>  the glabrous phenotype in csgl <dig> was due to insertion of an autonomous, active, class i transposable element in csgl <dig>  a class iv hd-zip transcription factor. csgl <dig> was epistatic to csgl <dig>  csgl <dig> seemed to play important roles in cucumber trichome initiation whereas csgl <dig> may act downstream in the trichome development pathway. findings from the present study provide new insights into genetic control of trichome development in cucumber.
