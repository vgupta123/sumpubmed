BACKGROUND
recent studies indicate a central role for the il-23/il- <dig> axis in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis  but the importance in the context of treatment outcome is unknown. we studied various cytokines, including the il-23/il- <dig> axis, in association to histopathology and response to therapy.

methods
fifty-two patients with active ln were included. renal biopsies were performed at baseline and after immunosuppressive treatment. serum levels of tnf-α, ifn-γ, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tgf-β were analysed at both biopsy occasions and in  <dig> healthy controls. il- <dig> expression in renal tissue was assessed by immunohistochemistry. biopsies were evaluated regarding who-classification and renal disease activity was estimated using the bilag-index. improvement of  <dig> grades in renal bilag was regarded complete response, and  <dig> grade partial response.


RESULTS
at baseline, all patients had high disease activity . baseline levels of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and ifn-γ  were increased in patients vs. controls. in contrast, tgf-β was lower in patients compared to controls .

baseline levels of il- <dig> were higher in patients with persisting active nephritis  after treatment, i.e. a poor histological response, vs. who i-ii . at follow-up, il- <dig> were higher in bilag-non-responders vs. responders . immunostaining of renal tissue revealed il- <dig> expression in inflammatory infiltrates.


CONCLUSIONS
high baseline il- <dig> predicted an unfavourable histopathological response, and bilag-non-responders had high il- <dig>  indicating that that a subset of ln-patients has a th- <dig> phenotype that may influence response to treatment and could be evaluated as a biomarker for poor therapeutic response.
