BACKGROUND
intergenic splicing resulting in the combination of mrnas sequences from distinct genes is a newly identified mechanism likely to contribute to protein diversity. few cases have been described, most of them involving neighboring genes and thus suggesting a cotranscription event presumably due to transcriptional termination bypass.


RESULTS
we identified bovine chimeric transcripts resulting from cotranscription and intergenic splicing of two neighboring genes, pparg and tsen <dig>  these two genes encode the peroxisome proliferator activated receptors γ <dig> and γ <dig> and the trna splicing endonuclease  <dig> homolog and are situated in the same orientation about  <dig> kb apart on bovine chromosome 22q <dig>  their relative position is conserved in human and mouse. we identified two types of chimeric transcripts containing all but the last exon of the pparg gene followed by all but the first exon of the tsen <dig> gene. the two chimers differ by the presence/absence of an intermediate exon resulting from transcription of a line l <dig> sequence situated between the two genes. both transcripts use canonical splice sites for all exons coming from both genes, as well as for the line l <dig> sequence. one of these transcripts harbors a premature stop codon and the other encodes a putative chimeric protein combining most of the pparγ protein and the entire tsen <dig> protein, but we could not establish the existence of this protein.


CONCLUSIONS
by showing that both individual and chimeric transcripts are transcribed from pparg and tsen <dig>  we demonstrated regulation of transcription termination. further, the existence and functionality of a chimeric protein harboring active motifs that are a priori unrelated is hypothesized.
