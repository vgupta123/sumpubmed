BACKGROUND
remission of multiple sclerosis during periods of high ovarian hormone secretion  has led to a great deal of interest in the potential for estrogens to treat autoimmune disease. previous work has established that 17β-estradiol can inhibit onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , while ethinyl estradiol  can reduce the severity of established disease. in the current study, the influence of estrogen receptor-α  and the g-protein coupled estrogen receptor  on ee's ability to treat eae was explored.


RESULTS
ee reduced disease severity in wild-type and erα knockout  mice, but did not alter disease in the gpr30ko group. production of anti-inflammatory il- <dig> increased in ee-erko mice  but not in ee-gpr30ko mice .


CONCLUSIONS
differential production of il- <dig> following ee treatment in erko and gpr30ko animals may be responsible for the distinctly different effects on disease severity. increased il- <dig> in erko-ee compared to erko-controls is likely to be an important factor in reducing established disease. the inability of ee to reduce disease in gpr30ko mice indicates an important but still undefined role for gpr <dig> in regulating immune reactivity.
