BACKGROUND
in vivo studies demonstrate that the prox <dig> transcription factor plays a critical role in the development of the early lymphatic system. upon prox <dig> expression, early lymphatic endothelial cells differentiate from the cardinal vein and begin to express lymphatic markers such as vegfr- <dig>  lyve- <dig> and podoplanin. subsequent in vitro studies have found that differentiated vascular endothelial cells can be reprogrammed by prox <dig> to express a lymphatic gene profile, suggesting that prox <dig> can initiate the expression of a unique gene signature during lymphangiogenesis. while the in vitro data suggest that gene reprogramming occurs upon prox <dig> expression, it is not clear if this is a direct result of prox <dig> in vascular endothelial cells in vivo.


RESULTS
overexpression of prox <dig> in vascular endothelial cells during embryonic development results in the reprogramming of genes to that of a more lymphatic signature. consequent to this overexpression, embryos suffer from gross edema that results in embryonic lethality at e <dig> . furthermore, hemorrhaging and anemia is apparent along with clear defects in lymph sac development. alterations in junctional proteins resulting in an increase in vascular permeability upon prox <dig> overexpression may contribute to the complications found during embryonic development.


CONCLUSIONS
we present a novel mouse model that addresses the importance of prox <dig> in early embryonic lymphangiogenesis. it is clear that there needs to be a measured pattern of expression of prox <dig> during embryonic development. furthermore, prox <dig> reprograms vascular endothelial cells in vivo by creating a molecular signature to that of a lymphatic endothelial cell.
