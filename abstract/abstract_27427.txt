BACKGROUND
the saccharomyces cerevisiae 14-spanner drug:h+ antiporter family  <dig>  are transporters of the major facilitator superfamily  involved in multidrug resistance . although poorly characterized, dha <dig> family members were found to participate in the export of structurally and functionally unrelated compounds or in the uptake of amino acids into the vacuole or the cell. in s. cerevisiae, the four arn/sit family members encode siderophore transporters and the two gex family members encode glutathione extrusion pumps. the evolutionary history of dha <dig>  arn and gex genes, encoding 14-spanner mfs transporters, is reconstructed in this study.


RESULTS
the translated orfs of  <dig> strains from  <dig> hemiascomycetous species, including  <dig> pathogenic candida species, were compared using a local sequence similarity algorithm. the constraining and traversing of a network representing the pairwise similarity data gathered  <dig> full size proteins and retrieved arn and gex family members together with dha <dig> transporters, suggesting the existence of a close phylogenetic relationship among these 14-spanner major facilitators. gene neighbourhood analysis was combined with tree construction methodologies to reconstruct their evolutionary history and  <dig> dha <dig> gene lineages,  <dig> arn gene lineages, and  <dig> gex gene lineage, were identified. the s. cerevisiae dha <dig> proteins sge <dig>  azr <dig>  vba <dig> and vba <dig> co-clustered in a large phylogenetic branch, the atr <dig> and ymr279c genes were proposed to be paralogs formed during the whole genome duplication  whereas the closely related orf yor378w resides in its own lineage. homologs of s. cerevisiae dha <dig> vacuolar proteins vba <dig>  vba <dig> and vba <dig> occur widespread in the hemiascomycetes. arn1/arn <dig> homologs were only found in species belonging to the saccharomyces complex and are more abundant in the pre-wgd species. arn <dig> homologs were only found in sub-telomeric regions of species belonging to the sacharomyces sensu strictu group . arn <dig> type siderophore transporters are abundant in the hemiascomycetes and form an ancient gene lineage extending to the filamentous fungi.


CONCLUSIONS
the evolutionary history of dha <dig>  arn and gex genes was reconstructed and a common evolutionary root shared by the encoded proteins is hypothesized. a new protein family, denominated dag, is proposed to span these three phylogenetic subfamilies of 14-spanner mfs transporters.
