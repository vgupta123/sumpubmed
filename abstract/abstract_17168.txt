BACKGROUND
integrated genetic and physical maps are extremely valuable for genomic studies and as important references for assembling whole genome shotgun sequences. screening of a bac library using molecular markers is an indispensable procedure for integration of both physical and genetic maps of a genome. molecular markers provide anchor points for integration of genetic and physical maps and also validate bac contigs assembled based solely on bac fingerprints. we employed a six-dimensional bac pooling strategy and an in silico approach to anchor molecular markers onto the soybean physical map.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  markers  were anchored by pcr on a subset of a williams  <dig> bsty i bac library pooled into  <dig> pools in six dimensions. this resulted in  <dig>  clones  associated with  <dig> markers, of which the majority of clones  were anchored by one marker and  <dig>  individual clones contained two or more markers. this contributed to  <dig> contigs having anchor points through this 6-d pool screening effort. in parallel, the  <dig>  soybean unigene set from ncbi was used to perform in silico mapping on  <dig>  williams  <dig> bac end sequences . this in silico analysis yielded  <dig>  positive results anchored by  <dig> unigenes that contributed to  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons. among the  <dig> contigs,  <dig> have not been previously anchored by pcr. therefore,  <dig>  of  <dig> contigs are anchored with molecular markers. these results are being integrated with bac fingerprints to assemble the bac contigs. ultimately, these efforts will lead to an integrated physical and genetic map resource.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that the six-dimensional soybean bac pools can be efficiently used to anchor markers to soybean bacs despite the complexity of the soybean genome. in addition to anchoring markers, the 6-d pooling method was also effective for targeting bac clones for investigating gene families and duplicated regions in the genome, as well as for extending physical map contigs.
