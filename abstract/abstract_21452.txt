BACKGROUND
west nile virus  persists in humans and several animal models. we previously demonstrated that wnv persists in the central nervous system  of mice for up to  <dig> months post-inoculation. we hypothesized that the cns immune response is ineffective in clearing the virus.


RESULTS
immunocompetent, adult mice were inoculated subcutaneously with wnv, and the cns immune response was examined at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> weeks post-inoculation . characterization of lymphocyte phenotypes in the cns revealed elevation of cd19+ b cells for  <dig> wpi, cd <dig> plasma cells at  <dig> wpi, and cd4+ and cd8+ t cells for at least  <dig> wpi. t cells recruited to the brain were activated, and regulatory t cells  were present for at least  <dig> wpi. wnv-specific antibody secreting cells were detected in the brain from  <dig> to  <dig> wpi, and virus-specific cd8+ t cells directed against an immunodominant wnv epitope were detected in the brain from  <dig> to  <dig> wpi. furthermore, these wnv-specific immune responses occurred in mice with and without acute clinical disease.


CONCLUSIONS
virus-specific immune cells persist in the cns of mice after wnv infection for up to  <dig> wpi.
