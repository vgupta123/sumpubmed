BACKGROUND
family  <dig> alkaline xylanases have great potential economic applications in the pulp and paper industry. in this study, we would improve the alkalophilicity of family  <dig> alkaline xylanase xyn11a-lc from bacillus sp. sn <dig>  for the better application in this field.


RESULTS
a random mutation library of xyn11a-lc with about  <dig>  clones was constructed by error-prone pcr. one mutant, m52-c <dig> , with improved alkalophilicity was obtained from the library. site-directed mutation showed that the mutation e135v was responsible for the alkalophilicity of the mutant. the variant e135v shifted the optimum ph of the wild-type enzyme from  <dig>  to  <dig> . compared to the relative activities of the wild type enzyme, those of the mutant e135v increased by  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % at ph  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. furthermore, glu <dig> saturation mutagenesis showed that the only mutant to have better alkalophilicity than e135v was e135r. the optimal ph of the mutant e135r was  <dig> ,  <dig>  ph units higher than that of the wild-type. in addition, compared to the wild-type enzyme, the mutations e135v and e135r increased the catalytic efficiency  by  <dig> and 37 %, respectively. structural analysis showed that the residue at position  <dig>  located in the eight-residue loop on the protein surface, might improve the alkalophilicity and catalytic activity by the elimination of the negative charge and the formation of salt-bridge.


CONCLUSIONS
mutants e135v and e135r with improved alkalophilicity were obtained by directed evolution and site saturation mutagenesis. the residue at position  <dig> in the eight-residue loop on the protein surface was found to play an important role in the ph activity profile of family  <dig> xylanases. this study provided alkalophilic mutants for application in bleaching process, and it was also helpful to understand the alkaline adaptation mechanism of family  <dig> xylanases.
