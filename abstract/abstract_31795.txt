BACKGROUND
micrornas , a family of small non-coding rna molecules, appear to regulate animal lipid metabolism and preadipocyte conversion to form lipid-assimilating adipocytes . however, no mirna to date has been reported to modulate adipogenesis and lipid deposition in beef cattle.


RESULTS
the expression patterns of  <dig> mirnas including four bovine specific mirnas in subcutaneous adipose tissues from three groups of crossbred steers differing in backfat thickness were compared using qrt-pcr analysis. eighty-six mirnas were detectable in all samples, with  <dig> mirnas differing among crossbreds  and  <dig> mirnas differentially expressed between tissues with high and low backfat thickness . the expression levels of  <dig> mirnas were correlated with backfat thickness . the mirna most differentially expressed and the most strongly associated with backfat thickness was mir- <dig>  with a  <dig> -fold increase in high backfat thickness tissues .


CONCLUSIONS
mirna expression patterns differed significantly in response to host genetic components. approximately 20% of the mirnas in this study were identified as being correlated with backfat thickness. this result suggests that mirnas may play a regulatory role in white adipose tissue development in beef animals.
