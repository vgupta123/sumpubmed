BACKGROUND
muscle development and remodelling, mitochondrial physiology and inflammation are thought to be inter-related and to have implications for metabolism in both health and disease. however, our understanding of their molecular control is incomplete.


RESULTS
in this study we have confirmed that the ring finger  <dig> protein , a poorly understood transcriptional regulator, influences the expression of both mitochondrial and immune-related genes. the prediction was based on a combination of network connectivity and differential connectivity in cattle  and mice data sets, with a focus on skeletal muscle. they assigned similar probability to mammalian rnf <dig> playing a regulatory role in mitochondrial and immune gene expression. to try and resolve this apparent ambiguity we performed a genome-wide microarray expression analysis on mouse c2c <dig> myoblasts transiently transfected with two rnf <dig> transcript variants that encode  <dig> naturally occurring but different rnf <dig> protein isoforms. the effect of both constructs was significantly different to the control samples . cluster analyses revealed that transfection with the two rnf <dig> constructs yielded discrete expression signatures from each other, but in both cases a substantial set of genes annotated as encoding proteins related to immune function were perturbed. these included cytokines and interferon regulatory factors. additionally, transfection of the longer transcript variant  <dig> coordinately increased the expression of  <dig>  mitochondrial proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome,  <dig> of which were significant in isolated pair-wise comparisons . this apparent additional mitochondrial function may be attributable to the rwd protein domain that is present only in the longer rnf <dig> isoform.


CONCLUSIONS
rnf <dig> influences the expression of both mitochondrial and immune related genes in a skeletal muscle context, and has likely implications for the inter-relationship between bioenergetic status and inflammation.
