BACKGROUND
gene targeting in nonhuman primates has the potential to produce critical animal models for translational studies related to human diseases. successful gene targeting in fibroblasts followed by somatic cell nuclear transfer  has been achieved in several species of large mammals but not yet in primates. our goal was to establish the protocols necessary to achieve gene targeting in primary culture of adult rhesus macaque fibroblasts as a first step in creating nonhuman primate models of genetic disease using nuclear transfer technology.


RESULTS
a primary culture of adult male fibroblasts was transfected with htert to overcome senescence and allow long term in vitro manipulations. successful gene targeting of the hprt locus in rhesus macaques was achieved by electroporating s-phase synchronized cells with a construct containing a sv <dig> enhancer.


CONCLUSIONS
the cell lines reported here could be used for the production of null mutant rhesus macaque models of human genetic disease using scnt technology. in addition, given the close evolutionary relationship and biological similarity between rhesus macaques and humans, the protocols described here may prove useful in the genetic engineering of human somatic cells.
