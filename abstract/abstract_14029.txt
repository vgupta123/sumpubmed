BACKGROUND
isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy in mice has been used in a number of studies to model human cardiac disease. in this study, we compared the transcriptional response of the heart in this model to other animal models of heart failure, as well as to the transcriptional response of human hearts suffering heart failure.


RESULTS
we performed microarray analyses on rna from mice with isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy and mice with exercise-induced physiological hypertrophy and identified  <dig> and  <dig>  genes that were significantly altered in pathological and physiological cardiac hypertrophy models, respectively. we compared our results to  <dig> different microarray data sets  representing various other animal models and four human cardiac diseases and identified a canonical set of  <dig> genes that are generally altered in failing hearts. we also produced a pairwise similarity matrix to illustrate relatedness of animal models with human heart disease and identified ischemia as the human condition that most resembles isoproterenol treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
the overall patterns of gene expression are consistent with observed structural and molecular differences between normal and maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy and support a role for the immune system  in the pathology of stress-induced hypertrophy. cross-study comparisons such as the results presented here provide targets for further research of cardiac disease that might generally apply to maladaptive cardiac stresses and are also a means of identifying which animal models best recapitulate human disease at the transcriptional level.
