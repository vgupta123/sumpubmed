BACKGROUND
hypertonic saline and mannitol are commonly used in the treatment of cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure  at present. in this connection, 10% hypertonic saline  alleviates cerebral edema more effectively than the equal volume of 20% mannitol. however, the exact underlying mechanism for this remains obscure. this study aimed to explore the possible mechanism whereby 10% hypertonic saline can ameliorate cerebral edema more effectively than mannitol.


RESULTS
adult male sprague-dawley  rats were subjected to permanent right-sided middle cerebral artery occlusion  and treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of 10% hs, 20% mannitol or d--mannitol. brain water content  as analyzed by wet-to-dry ratios in the ischemic hemisphere of sd rats decreased more significantly after 10% hs treatment compared with 20% mannitol. concentration of serum na+ and plasma crystal osmotic pressure of the 10% hs group at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h following permanent mcao increased significantly when compared with 20% mannitol treated group. moreover, there was negative correlation between the bwc of the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere and concentration of serum na+, plasma crystal osmotic pressure and difference value of concentration of serum na+ and concentration of brain na+ in ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere in the 10% hs group at the various time points after mcao. a remarkable finding was the progressive accumulation of mannitol in the ischemic brain tissue.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that 10% hs is more effective in alleviating cerebral edema than the equal volume of 20% mannitol. this is because 10% hs contributes to establish a higher osmotic gradient across bbb and, furthermore, the progressive accumulation of mannitol in the ischemic brain tissue counteracts its therapeutic efficacy on cerebral edema.
