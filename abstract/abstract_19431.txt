BACKGROUND
antimicrobial resistance among pneumococci has greatly increased over the past two to three decades. resistance to tetracycline ), chloramphenicol  and macrolides  and/or mef) is generally conferred by acquisition of specific genes that are associated with mobile genetic elements, including those of the tn <dig> and tn <dig> families. the first tetracycline-, chloramphenicol- and macrolide-resistant pneumococci were detected between  <dig> and 1970; however, until now the oldest pneumococcus shown to harbour tn <dig> and/or tn <dig> was isolated in  <dig>  in this study the genomes of  <dig> pneumococci isolated prior to  <dig> were probed for the presence of tet, cat, erm, mef and int  to indicate the presence of tn916/tn5252-like elements.


RESULTS
two tn916-like, tet-containing, elements were identified among pneumococci dated  <dig> and  <dig>  the former element was highly similar to that of the pmen <dig> multidrug-resistant, globally-distributed pneumococcal reference strain, which was isolated in  <dig>  the latter element was associated with a streptococcal phage. a third, novel genetic element, designated icesppn <dig>  was identified in the genome of an isolate dated  <dig>  icesppn <dig> contained a region of similarity to tn <dig>  a region of similarity to a pneumococcal pathogenicity island and novel lantibiotic synthesis/export-associated genes.


CONCLUSIONS
these data confirm the existence of pneumococcal tn <dig> elements in the first decade within which pneumococcal tetracycline resistance was described. furthermore, the discovery of icesppn <dig> demonstrates the dynamic variability of pneumococcal genetic elements and is contrasted with the evidence for tn <dig> stability.
