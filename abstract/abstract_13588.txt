BACKGROUND
biodegradation of rubber  is initiated by oxidative cleavage of the polyisoprene backbone and is performed either by an extracellular rubber oxygenase  from gram-negative rubber degrading bacteria or by a latex clearing protein  secreted by gram-positive rubber degrading bacteria. only little is known on the biochemistry of polyisoprene cleavage by lcp and on the types and functions of the involved cofactors.


RESULTS
a rubber-degrading bacterium was isolated from the effluent of a rubber-processing factory and was taxonomically identified as a rhodococcus rhodochrous species. a gene of r. rhodochrous rpk <dig> that coded for a polyisoprene-cleaving latex clearing protein  was identified, cloned, expressed in escherichia coli and purified. purified lcprr had a specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg at 30 °c and degraded poly to a mixture of oligoisoprene molecules with terminal keto and aldehyde groups. the ph optimum of lcprr was higher  than for other rubber-cleaving enzymes . uvvis spectroscopic analysis of lcprr revealed a cytochrome-specific absorption spectrum with an additional feature at long wavelengths that has not been observed for any other rubber-cleaving enzyme. the presence of one b-type haem in lcprr as a co-factor was confirmed by  metal analysis,  solvent extraction,  bipyridyl assay and  detection of haem-b specific m/z values via mass-spectrometry.


CONCLUSIONS
our data point to substantial differences in the active sites of lcp proteins obtained from different rubber degrading bacteria.
