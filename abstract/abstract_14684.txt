BACKGROUND
mycoplasma pneumoniae is responsible for acute respiratory tract infections  common in children and young adults. as m. pneumoniae is innately resistant to Î²-lactams antibiotics usually given as the first-line treatment for rtis, specific and early diagnosis is important in order to select the right treatment. serology is the most used diagnostic method for m. pneumoniae infections.


RESULTS
in this study, we identified the m. pneumoniae atp synthase beta subunit  by serologic proteome analysis and evaluated its usefulness in the development of a serological assay. we successfully expressed and purified recombinant atpd  protein, which was recognised by serum samples from m. pneumoniae-infected patient in immunoblots. the performance of the recombinant protein ratpd was studied using a panel of serum samples from  <dig> infected patients and  <dig> healthy blood donors in an in-house igm, iga and igg enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . the results of this assay were then compared with those of an in-house elisa with a recombinant c-terminal fragment of the p <dig> adhesin  and of the commercial ani labsystems elisa kit using an adhesin p1-enriched whole-cell extract. performances of the ratpd and rp1-c antigen combination were further assessed by binary logistic regression analysis. we showed that combination of ratpd and rp1-c discriminated maximally between the patients infected with m. pneumoniae  and the healthy subjects for the igm class, performing better than the single recombinant antigens or the commercial whole-cell extract.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that atpd can be used as an antigen for the immunodiagnosis of early and acute m. pneumoniae infection in association with adhesin p <dig>  providing an excellent starting point for the development of point-of-care diagnostic assays.
