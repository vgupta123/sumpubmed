BACKGROUND
mutations to the tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> genes cause the disease tuberous sclerosis complex. the tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> gene products form a protein complex that integrates multiple metabolic signals to regulate the activity of the target of rapamycin  complex  <dig>  and thereby control cell growth. here we investigate the quaternary structure of the tsc1-tsc <dig> complex by gel filtration and coimmunoprecipitation.


RESULTS
tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> co-eluted in high molecular weight fractions by gel filtration. coimmunoprecipitation of distinct tagged tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> isoforms demonstrated that tsc1-tsc <dig> complexes contain multiple tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> subunits.


CONCLUSIONS
tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> interact to form large complexes containing multiple tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> subunits.
