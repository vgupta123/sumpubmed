BACKGROUND
peanut  is an autogamous allotetraploid legume  that is widely cultivated as a food and oil crop. more than  <dig>  dna markers have been developed in arachis spp., but high-density linkage maps useful for genetics, genomics, and breeding have not been constructed due to extremely low genetic diversity. polymorphic marker loci are useful for the construction of such high-density linkage maps. the present study used in silico analysis to develop simple sequence repeat-based and transposon-based markers.


RESULTS
the use of in silico analysis increased the efficiency of polymorphic marker development by more than 3-fold. in total,  <dig>  of  <dig>  markers showed polymorphisms between parental lines of the mapping population. linkage analysis of the  <dig> markers along with  <dig> polymorphic markers selected from  <dig>  published markers generated  <dig> linkage groups covering  <dig> .4â€‰cm with  <dig>  loci. based on the map thus produced,  <dig> quantitative trait loci  for  <dig> agronomical traits were detected. another linkage map with  <dig> loci was also constructed and revealed a relationship between the genotypes of the fad <dig> genes and the ratio of oleic/linoleic acid in peanut seed.


CONCLUSIONS
in silico analysis of polymorphisms increased the efficiency of polymorphic marker development, and contributed to the construction of high-density linkage maps in cultivated peanut. the resultant maps were applicable to qtl analysis. marker subsets and linkage maps developed in this study should be useful for genetics, genomics, and breeding in arachis. the data are available at the kazusa dna marker database .
