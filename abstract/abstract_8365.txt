BACKGROUND
the delta-proteobacterium desulfotignum phosphitoxidans is a type strain of the genus desulfotignum, which comprises to date only three species together with d. balticum and d. toluenicum. d. phosphitoxidans oxidizes phosphite to phosphate as its only source of electrons, with either sulfate or co <dig> as electron acceptor to gain its metabolic energy, which is of exclusive interest. sequencing of the genome of this bacterium was undertaken to elucidate the genomic basis of this so far unique type of energy metabolism.


RESULTS
the genome contains  <dig> , <dig> base pairs and  <dig> genes of which  <dig> were assigned to a function, and  <dig> are without function prediction. metabolic reconstruction revealed that most biosynthetic pathways of gram negative, autotrophic sulfate reducers were present. autotrophic co <dig> assimilation proceeds through the wood-ljungdahl pathway. additionally, we have found and confirmed the ability of the strain to couple phosphite oxidation to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia, which in itself is a new type of energy metabolism. surprisingly, only two pathways for uptake, assimilation and utilization of inorganic and organic phosphonates were found in the genome. the unique for d. phosphitoxidans ptx-ptd cluster is involved in inorganic phosphite oxidation and an atypical c-p lyase-coding cluster  is involved in utilization of organophosphonates.


CONCLUSIONS
we present the whole genome sequence of the first bacterium able to gain metabolic energy via phosphite oxidation. the data obtained provide initial information on the composition and architecture of the phosphite–utilizing and energy-transducing systems needed to live with phosphite as an unusual electron donor.
