BACKGROUND
using motif detection programs it is fairly straightforward to identify conserved cis-sequences in promoters of co-regulated genes. in contrast, the identification of the transcription factors  interacting with these cis-sequences is much more elaborate. to facilitate this, we explore the possibility of using several bioinformatic and experimental approaches for tf identification. this starts with the selection of co-regulated gene sets and leads first to the prediction and then to the experimental validation of tfs interacting with cis-sequences conserved in the promoters of these co-regulated genes.


RESULTS
using the pathoplant database,  <dig> up-regulated gene groups were identified with microarray data for drought-responsive gene expression from arabidopsis thaliana. application of the binding site estimation suite of tools  discovered  <dig> conserved sequence motifs within the corresponding promoters. using the stamp web-server,  <dig> sequence motifs were classified into  <dig> motif families for which similarities with known cis-regulatory sequences were identified. all motifs were subjected to a footprintdb analysis to predict interacting dna binding domains from plant tf families. predictions were confirmed by using a yeast-one-hybrid approach to select interacting tfs belonging to the predicted tf families. tf-dna interactions were further experimentally validated in yeast and with a physcomitrella patens transient expression system, leading to the discovery of several novel tf-dna interactions.


CONCLUSIONS
the present work demonstrates the successful integration of several bioinformatic resources with experimental approaches to predict and validate tfs interacting with conserved sequence motifs in co-regulated genes.
