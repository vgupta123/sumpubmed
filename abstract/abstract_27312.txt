BACKGROUND
the ncoa <dig> gene product is an estrogen receptor associated protein that is highly similar to the human oxr <dig> gene product, which functions in oxidation resistance. oxr genes are conserved among all sequenced eukaryotes from yeast to humans. in this study we examine if ncoa <dig> has an oxidation resistance function similar to that demonstrated for oxr <dig>  we also examine ncoa <dig> expression in response to oxidative stress and its subcellular localization in human cells, comparing these properties with those of oxr <dig> 


RESULTS
we find that ncoa <dig>  like oxr <dig> can suppress the oxidative mutator phenotype when expressed in an e. coli strain that exhibits an oxidation specific mutator phenotype. moreover, ncoa7's oxidation resistance function requires expression of only its carboxyl-terminal domain and is similar in this regard to oxr <dig>  we find that, in human cells, ncoa <dig> is constitutively expressed and is not induced by oxidative stress and appears to localize to the nucleus following estradiol stimulation. these properties of ncoa <dig> are in striking contrast to those of oxr <dig>  which is induced by oxidative stress, localizes to mitochondria, and appears to be excluded, or largely absent from nuclei.


CONCLUSIONS
ncoa <dig> most likely arose from duplication. like its homologue, oxr <dig>  it is capable of reducing the dna damaging effects of reactive oxygen species when expressed in bacteria, indicating the protein has an activity that can contribute to oxidation resistance. unlike oxr <dig>  it appears to localize to nuclei and interacts with the estrogen receptor. this raises the possibility that ncoa <dig> encodes the nuclear counterpart of the mitochondrial oxr <dig> protein and in mammalian cells it may reduce the oxidative by-products of estrogen metabolite-mediated dna damage.
