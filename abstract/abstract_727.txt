BACKGROUND
multiplexing multiple samples during illumina sequencing is a common practice and is rapidly growing in importance as the throughput of the platform increases. misassignments during de-multiplexing, where sequences are associated with the wrong sample, are an overlooked error mode on the illumina sequencing platform. this results in a low rate of cross-talk among multiplexed samples and can cause detrimental effects in studies requiring the detection of rare variants or when multiplexing a large number of samples.


RESULTS
we observed rates of cross-talk averaging  <dig>  % when multiplexing  <dig> different samples with unique i <dig> and i <dig> index sequences. this cross-talk rate corresponded to  <dig>  misassigned reads on a single lane of the illumina hiseq  <dig>  notably, all types of misassignment occur at similar rates: incorrect i <dig>  incorrect i <dig>  and incorrect sequence reads. we demonstrate that misassignments can be nearly eliminated by quality filtering of index reads while preserving about 90 % of the original sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
cross-talk among multiplexed samples is a significant error mode on the illumina platform, especially if samples are only separated by a single unique index. quality filtering of index sequences offers an effective solution to minimizing cross-talk among samples. furthermore, we propose a straightforward method for verifying the extent of cross-talk between samples and optimizing quality score thresholds that does not require additional control samples and can even be performed post hoc on previous runs.
