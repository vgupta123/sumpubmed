BACKGROUND
recurrent non-random genomic alterations are the hallmarks of cancer and the characterization of these imbalances is critical to our understanding of tumorigenesis and cancer progression.


RESULTS
we performed array-comparative genomic hybridization  on cdna microarrays containing  <dig>  elements in neuroblastoma . we found that only two chromosomes  had gene amplifications and all were in the mycn amplified samples. there were  <dig> independent non-contiguous amplicons  on chromosome  <dig>  and the largest contiguous region was  <dig>  mb bounded by nag and an est ; the smallest region was  <dig> kb including an est , ncym, and mycn. using a probabilistic approach to identify single copy number changes, we systemically investigated the genomic alterations occurring in stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> nbs with and without mycn amplification . we have not found genomic alterations universally present in all  three subgroups of nbs. however we identified both common and unique patterns of genomic imbalance in nb including gain of 7q <dig>  17q <dig>  17q23- <dig> and loss of 3p <dig> were common to all three categories. finally we confirm that the most frequent specific changes in stage 4+ tumors were the loss of 1p <dig> with gain of 2p24- <dig> and they had fewer genomic alterations compared to either stage  <dig> or 4-, indicating that for this subgroup of poor risk nb requires a smaller number of genomic changes are required to develop the malignant phenotype.


CONCLUSIONS
cdna a-cgh analysis is an efficient method for the detection and characterization of amplicons. furthermore we were able to detect single copy number changes using our probabilistic approach and identified genomic alterations specific to stage and mycn amplification.
