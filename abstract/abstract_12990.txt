BACKGROUND
hemolysins are crucial virulence factors which help pathogens to survive and persist in the host. this study investigated whether common electrolytes will affect the hemolysins of candida species. the hemolysins from  <dig> candida isolates were investigated using a plate specially designed for candida species in the presence of three electrolytes, cacl <dig>  nacl and kcl, at different concentrations. the hemolytic activity was determined after 48 h and the hemolytic index was calculated.


RESULTS
all three electrolytes caused a decrease in the hemolytic activity. significant differences existed between varying concentrations of nacl, while no significant differences existed for the cacl <dig> and kcl groups. additionally, the peripheral hemolytic index was highly correlated with the hemolytic index .


CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate that electrolytes reduce hemolysis by candida species and a correlation exists between the peripheral hemolytic index and the translucent hemolytic index.
