BACKGROUND
cost effective next generation sequencing technologies now enable the production of genomic datasets for many novel planktonic eukaryotes, representing an understudied reservoir of genetic diversity. o. tauri is the smallest free-living photosynthetic eukaryote known to date, a coccoid green alga that was first isolated in  <dig> in a lagoon by the mediterranean sea. its simple features, ease of culture and the sequencing of its 13 mb haploid nuclear genome have promoted this microalga as a new model organism for cell biology. here, we investigated the quality of genome assemblies of illumina gaiix 75 bp paired-end reads from ostreococcus tauri, thereby also improving the existing assembly and showing the genome to be stably maintained in culture.


RESULTS
the  <dig> assemblers used, abyss, clcbio and velvet, produced 95% complete genomes in  <dig> to  <dig> scaffolds with a very low rate of misassembly. reciprocally, these assemblies improved the original genome assembly by filling in  <dig> gaps. combined with additional analysis of raw reads and pcr sequencing effort,  <dig> gaps have been solved in total adding up to 460 kb of sequence. mapping of rnaseq illumina data on this updated genome led to a twofold reduction in the proportion of multi-exon protein coding genes, representing 19% of the total  <dig> protein coding genes. the comparison of the dna extracted in  <dig> and  <dig> revealed the fixation of  <dig> single nucleotide substitutions and  <dig> deletions during the approximately  <dig> generations in the lab. the deletions either knocked out or truncated two predicted transmembrane proteins, including a glutamate-receptor like gene.


CONCLUSIONS
high coverage  paired-end illumina sequencing enables a high quality 95% complete genome assembly of a compact ~13 mb haploid eukaryote. this genome sequence has remained stable for  <dig> generations of lab culture.
