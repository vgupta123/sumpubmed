BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small non-coding rnas found to regulate several biological processes including adipogenesis. understanding adipose tissue regulation is critical for beef cattle as fat is an important determinant of beef quality and nutrient value. this study analyzed the association between genomic context characteristics of mirnas with their expression and function in bovine adipose tissue. twenty-four subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were obtained from eight british-continental crossbred steers at  <dig> different time points. total rna was extracted and mirnas were profiled using a mirna microarray with expression further validated by qrt-pcr.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> mirnas were detected of which  <dig> were expressed in all steers , and defined as the core mirnas of bovine subcutaneous adipose tissue. core adipose mirnas varied in terms of genomic location , organization , and conservation . clustered mirnas and highly conserved mirnas were more highly expressed  and had more predicted targets than non-clustered or less conserved mirnas . a total of  <dig> mirnas were coordinately expressed, being part of six identified relevant networks. two intronic mirnas  were confirmed to have coordinated expression with their host genes, transcriptional factor srebf <dig> and ep <dig> , respectively which are involved in lipid metabolism, suggesting these mirnas may also play a role in regulation of bovine lipid metabolism/adipogenesis. furthermore, a total of  <dig> bovine specific mirnas were predicted to be involved in the regulation of energy balance in adipose tissue.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings improve our understanding on the behavior of mirnas in the regulation of bovine adipogenesis and fat metabolism as it reveals that mirna expression patterns and functions are associated with mirna genomic location, organization and conservation.
