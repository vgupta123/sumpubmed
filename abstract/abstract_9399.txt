BACKGROUND
latrunculin a microperfusion of the hippocampus induces acute epileptic seizures and long-term biochemical changes leading to spontaneous seizures. this study tested the effect of eslicarbazepine acetate , a novel antiepileptic drug, on latrunculin a-induced acute and chronic seizures, and changes in brain amino acid extracellular levels. hippocampi of swiss mice were continuously perfused with a latrunculin a solution  with continuous eeg and videotape recording for  <dig> consecutive days. microdialysate samples were analyzed by hplc and fluorescence detection of taurine, glycine, aspartate, glutamate and gaba. thereafter, mice were continuously video monitored for two months to identify chronic spontaneous seizures or behavioral changes. control eeg recordings  were performed in all animals at least once a week for a minimum of one month.


RESULTS
oral administration of esl , previous to latrunculin a microperfusion, completely prevented acute latrunculin a-induced seizures as well as chronic seizures and all eeg chronic signs of paroxysmal activity. hippocampal extracellular levels of taurine, glycine and aspartate were significantly increased during latrunculin a microperfusion, while gaba and glutamate levels remained unchanged. esl reversed the increases in extracellular taurine, glycine and aspartate concentrations to basal levels and significantly reduced glutamate levels. plasma and brain bioanalysis showed that esl was completely metabolized within 1 h after administration to mainly eslicarbazepine, its major active metabolite.


CONCLUSIONS
esl treatment prevented acute latrunculin a-induced seizures as well as chronic seizures and all eeg chronic signs of paroxysmal activity, supporting a possible anti-epileptogenic effect of esl in mice.
