BACKGROUND
tcr and cxcr4-mediated signaling appears to be reciprocally regulated pathways. tcr activation dampens the chemotactic response towards the cxcr <dig> ligand cxcl <dig>  while t cells exposed to cxcl <dig> are less prone to subsequent tcr-activation. the heterotrimeric g proteins gαq and gαi <dig> have been implicated in cxcr4-signaling and we have recently also reported the possible involvement of gαq in tcr-dependent activation of lck . here we examined the role of gαq in migration and tcr activation.


RESULTS
pre-treatment of t cells with cxcl <dig> led to significantly reduced lck y <dig> phosphorylation upon tcr triggering indicating heterologous desensitization. we show that knockdown of gαq significantly enhanced basal migration in t cells and reduced cxcl12-induced shp- <dig> phosphorylation whereas gαi <dig> knockdown inhibited cxcl12-induced migration.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that gαi <dig> confers migration signals in the presence of cxcl <dig> whereas gαq exerts a tonic inhibition on both basal and stimulated migrational responses. this is compatible with the notion that the level of gαq activation contributes to determining the commitment of the t cell either to migration or activation through the tcr.
