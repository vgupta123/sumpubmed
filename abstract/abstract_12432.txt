BACKGROUND
sex differences in the magnitude or direction of mutational effect may be important to a variety of population processes, shaping the mutation load and affecting the cost of sex itself. these differences are expected to be greatest after sexual maturity. mutation-accumulation  experiments provide the most direct way to examine the consequences of new mutations, but most studies have focused on juvenile viability without regard to sex, and on autosomes rather than sex chromosomes; both adult fitness and x-linkage have been little studied. we therefore investigated the effects of  <dig> generations of x-chromosome mutation accumulation on the fitness of males and females derived from an outbred population of drosophila melanogaster.


RESULTS
fitness declined rapidly in both sexes as a result of ma, but adult males showed markedly greater fitness loss relative to their controls compared to females expressing identical genotypes, even when females were made homozygous for the x. we estimate that these mutations are partially additive  in females. in addition, the majority of new mutations appear to harm both males and females.


CONCLUSIONS
our data helps fill a gap in our understanding of the consequences of sexual selection for genetic load, and suggests that stronger selection on males may indeed purge deleterious mutations affecting female fitness.
