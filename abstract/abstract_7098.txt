BACKGROUND
the cancer stem cell  hypothesis proposes that a population of tumor cells bearing stem cell properties is responsible for the origin and maintenance of tumors. normal and cancer stem cells possess the ability to grow in vitro as self-renewing spheres, but the molecular basis of this phenotype remains largely unknown. we intended to establish a comprehensive culture system to grow prostatospheres  from both cancer cell lines and patient tumors. we then used gene expression microarrays to gain insight on the molecular pathways that sustain the ps tumor initiating cell  phenotype.


RESULTS
traditional stem cell medium  supplemented with knockoutâ„¢sr  allows the propagation of monoclonal pss from cell lines and primary cells. pss display gene expression and tumorigenicity hallmarks of tics. gene expression analysis defined a gene signature composed of  <dig> genes that characterize lncap and patient pss. this set includes novel prostate tic growth factors , proteins implicated in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal maintenance, transcriptional regulators  and factors involved in protein biosynthesis and metabolism. meta-analysis in oncomine reveals that some of these genes correlate with prostate cancer status and/or progression. reporter genes and inhibitors indicate that the notch pathway contributes to prostatosphere growth.


CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a model for the culture of pss, and provide a genomic profile that support cscs identity. this signature identifies novel markers and pathways that are predicted to correlate with prostate cancer evolution.
