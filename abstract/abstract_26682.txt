BACKGROUND
the molecular mechanisms governing the formation of the embryonic vascular system remain poorly understood. here, we show that disabled- <dig> , a cytosolic adaptor protein, has a pivotal role in the blood vessel formation in xenopus early embryogenesis.


RESULTS
xenopus disabled- <dig>  is spatially localized to the blood vessels including the intersomitic veins  in early embryos. both antisense morpholino oligonucleotide -mediated knockdown and overexpression of xdab <dig> inhibit the formation of isv, which arise from angiogenesis. in addition, we found that activin-like signaling is essential for this angiogenic event. functional assays in xenopus animal caps reveal that activin-like signals induce vegf expression and this induction can be inhibited by xdab <dig> depletion. however, xdab <dig> mo has no effects on the induction of other target genes by activin-like signals. furthermore, we show that the disruption of the sprouting isv in xdab2-depleted embryos can be rescued by coexpression of vegf.


CONCLUSIONS
taking together, we suggest that xdab <dig> regulates the embryonic angiogenesis by mediating the vegf induction by activin-like signaling in xenopus early development.
