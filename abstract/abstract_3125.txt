BACKGROUND
leptospirosis is considered a re-emerging infectious disease caused by pathogenic spirochaetes of the genus leptospira. pathogenic leptospires have the ability to survive and disseminate to multiple organs after penetrating the host. leptospires were shown to express surface proteins that interact with the extracellular matrix  and to plasminogen . this study examined the interaction of two putative leptospiral proteins with laminin, collagen type i, collagen type iv, cellular fibronectin, plasma fibronectin, plg, factor h and c4bp.


RESULTS
we show that two leptospiral proteins encoded by lic <dig> and lic <dig> genes interact with laminin in a dose - dependent and saturable mode, with dissociation equilibrium constants  of  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm, respectively. these proteins were named lsa <dig> and lsa <dig>  for lic <dig> and lic <dig>  respectively. metaperiodate - treated laminin reduced lsa <dig> - laminin interaction, suggesting that sugar moieties of this ligand participate in this interaction. the lsa <dig> is also plg - binding receptor, with a kd of  <dig>  nm, capable of generating plasmin in the presence of an activator. although in a weak manner, both proteins interact with c4bp, a regulator of complement classical route. in silico analysis together with proteinase k and immunoflorescence data suggest that these proteins might be surface exposed. moreover, the recombinant proteins partially inhibited leptospiral adherence to immobilized laminin and plg.


CONCLUSIONS
we believe that these multifunctional proteins have the potential to participate in the interaction of leptospires to hosts by mediating adhesion and by helping the bacteria to escape the immune system and to overcome tissue barriers. to our knowledge, lsa <dig> is the first leptospiral protein described to date with the capability of binding laminin, plg and c4bp in vitro.
