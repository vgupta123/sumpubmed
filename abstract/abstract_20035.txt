BACKGROUND
clostridium acetobutylicum, a gram-positive and spore-forming anaerobe, is a major strain for the fermentative production of acetone, butanol and ethanol. but a previously isolated hyper-butanol producing strain c. acetobutylicum ea  <dig> does not produce spores and has greater capability of solvent production, especially for butanol, than the type strain c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig> 


RESULTS
complete genome of c. acetobutylicum ea  <dig> was sequenced using roche  <dig> pyrosequencing. genomic comparison with atcc  <dig> identified many variations which may contribute to the hyper-butanol producing characteristics in the ea  <dig> strain, including a total of  <dig> deletion sites and  <dig> insertion sites. in addition, transcriptomic profiling of gene expression in ea  <dig> relative to that of atcc <dig> revealed expression-level changes of several key genes related to solvent formation. for example, spo0a and adheii have higher expression level, and most of the acid formation related genes have lower expression level in ea  <dig>  interestingly, the results also showed that the variation in cea_g <dig> , a putative transcriptional regulator involved in xylose utilization, might accelerate utilization of substrate xylose.


CONCLUSIONS
comparative analysis of c. acetobutylicum hyper-butanol producing strain ea  <dig> and type strain atcc  <dig> at both genomic and transcriptomic levels, for the first time, provides molecular-level understanding of non-sporulation, higher solvent production and enhanced xylose utilization in the mutant ea  <dig>  the information could be valuable for further genetic modification of c. acetobutylicum for more effective butanol production.
