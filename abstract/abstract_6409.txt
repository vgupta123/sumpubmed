BACKGROUND
pelgipeptin, a potent antibacterial and antifungal agent, is a non-ribosomally synthesised lipopeptide antibiotic. this compound consists of a β-hydroxy fatty acid and nine amino acids. to date, there is no information about its biosynthetic pathway.


RESULTS
a potential pelgipeptin synthetase gene cluster  was identified from paenibacillus elgii b <dig> through genome analysis. the gene cluster spans  <dig>  kb with eight open reading frames. among the genes in this cluster, three large genes, plpd, plpe, and plpf, were shown to encode non-ribosomal peptide synthetases , with one, seven, and one module, respectively. bioinformatic analysis of the substrate specificity of all nine adenylation domains indicated that the sequence of the nrps modules is well collinear with the order of amino acids in pelgipeptin. additional biochemical analysis of four recombinant adenylation domains  provided further evidence that the plp gene cluster involved in pelgipeptin biosynthesis.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a gene cluster  responsible for the biosynthesis of pelgipeptin was identified from the genome sequence of paenibacillus elgii b <dig>  the identification of the plp gene cluster provides an opportunity to develop novel lipopeptide antibiotics by genetic engineering.
