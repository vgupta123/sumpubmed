BACKGROUND
endogenous non-coding small rnas  play an important role in post-transcriptional gene regulation in plants. domestication selection is the most important evolutionary force in shaping crop genomes. the extent of polymorphism at small rna loci in domesticated rice and whether small rna loci are targets of domestication selection have not yet been determined.


RESULTS
a polymorphism survey of  <dig> small rna loci  was conducted in domesticated rice, generating  <dig> mb of sequence data. many mutations  were observed at small rna loci in domesticated rice, e.g.  <dig> mutation sites were observed in the mature mirna sequences of  <dig> mirnas . several small rna loci showed significant signals for positive selection and/or potential domestication selection.


CONCLUSIONS
sequence variation at mirnas and other small rnas is higher than expected in domesticated rice. like protein-coding genes, non-coding small rna loci could be targets of domestication selection and play an important role in rice domestication and improvement.
