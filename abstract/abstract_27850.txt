BACKGROUND
b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma represents a diverse group of hematological malignancies, of which follicular lymphoma  is one of the most common subtypes. family and epidemiological studies suggest an important genetic role in the etiology of fl. in recent genome-wide association studies  of fl, several genetic susceptibility loci have been identified on chromosome 6p <dig>   and 6p <dig>   in the human leukocyte antigen class i and class ii regions. to identify new genetic variants and further elucidate the genetic basis of fl, a meta-analysis was performed of the top  <dig> snps associated with fl risk from two gwas in the us, denmark and sweden , with independent validation in  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls.


RESULTS
rs <dig> and rs <dig> in the hla class ii region were validated and inversely associated with fl risk . rs <dig>  which is in high linkage disequilibrium with rs <dig> , was no longer associated with fl after conditioning on rs <dig>  the rs <dig> association was independent of established fl snps, but not of the hla-dpb1* <dig> allele. using publicly available gene expression profiles with matching genotype information, we found that rs <dig> also was significantly correlated with increased hla-dpb <dig> expression.


CONCLUSIONS
by performing a meta-analysis of two gwas of fl, we further validated the relevance of hla-dpb1* <dig> as a protective allele in the pathogenesis of fl. moreover, the protective rs <dig> a allele correlated with increased levels of hla-dpb <dig>  suggesting a possible disease mechanism involving hla-dpb <dig> expression regulation. our results add further support to the major role of hla genetic variation in the pathogenesis of fl.
