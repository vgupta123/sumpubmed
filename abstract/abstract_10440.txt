BACKGROUND
lipopolysaccharide  induces acute liver injury and the complex mechanisms include the activation of toll like receptor  <dig>  signaling pathway in many species. however, immuno-pathological changes during tlr <dig> signaling under lps stress in acute liver injury is poorly understood in avian species. the present investigation was therefore carried out to evaluate these alterations in tlr <dig> signaling pathway during acute liver injury in young chickens.


RESULTS
after intraperitoneal injection of lps or saline, liver samples were harvested at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 120 h  and the microstructures were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin  staining. alanine aminotransferase  and caspase- <dig> enzyme activity was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . proliferative cell nuclear antigen , single stranded dna  and tlr <dig> protein expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry. gene expressions of pcna, caspase- <dig>  caspase- <dig>  tlr <dig> and its downstream molecules were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction . lps injection induced significantly higher alt activity, severe fatty degeneration, necrotic symptoms, ballooning degeneration, congestion, enhanced inflammatory cell infiltration in liver sinusoids, decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis and significant up-regulation in tlr <dig> and its downstream molecules  expression at different time points.


CONCLUSIONS
this study indicated that tlr <dig> signaling and its downstream molecules along with certain cytokines play a key role in acute liver injury in young chickens. hence, our findings provided novel information about the histopathological, proliferative and apoptotic alterations along with changes in alt and caspase- <dig> activities associated with acute liver injury induced by salmonella lps in avian species.
