BACKGROUND
overexpression of the human dyrk1a gene due to the presence of a third gene copy in trisomy  <dig> is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of down syndrome. the observation of gene dosage effects in transgenic mouse models implies that subtle changes in expression levels can affect the correct function of the dyrk1a gene product. we have therefore characterized the promoter of the human dyrk1a gene in order to study its transcriptional regulation.


RESULTS
transcription start sites of the human dyrk1a gene are distributed over  <dig> bp within a region previously identified as an unmethylated cpg island. we have identified a new alternative noncoding 5'-exon of the dyrk1a gene which is located  <dig> bp upstream of the previously described transcription start site. transcription of the two splicing variants is controlled by non-overlapping promoter regions that can independently drive reporter gene expression. we found no evidence of cell- or tissue-specific promoter usage, but the two promoter regions differed in their activity and their regulation. the sequence upstream of exon 1a  induced about 10-fold higher reporter gene activity than the sequence upstream of exon 1b . overexpression of the transcription factor e2f <dig> increased dyrk1a mrna levels in saos <dig> and phoenix cells and enhanced the activity of promoter region b three- to fourfold.


CONCLUSIONS
the identification of two alternatively spliced transcripts whose transcription is initiated from differentially regulated promoters regions indicates that the expression of the dyrk1a gene is subject to complex control mechanisms. the regulatory effect of e2f <dig> suggests that dyrk1a may play a role in cell cycle regulation or apoptosis.
