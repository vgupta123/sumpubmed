BACKGROUND
dnmt3a is a dna methyltransferase that establishes de novo dna methylation in mammals. the structure of the dnmt3a c-terminal domain is similar to the bacterial m. hhai enzyme, a well-studied prokaryotic dna methyltransferase. no x-ray structure is available for the complex of dnmt3a with dna and the mechanistic details of dna recognition and catalysis by mammalian dnmts are not completely understood.


RESULTS
mutant variants of the catalytic domain of the murine dnmt3a carrying substitutions of highly conserved n <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig> have been generated by site directed mutagenesis and purified. their methylation activity, dna binding affinity, ability to flip the target cytosine out of the dna double helix and covalent complex formation with dna have been examined. substitutions of n <dig> lead to reduced catalytic activity and reduced base flipping. catalytic activity, base flipping, and covalent conjugate formation were almost completely abolished for the mutant enzymes with substitutions of r <dig> or r <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that r <dig> plays a similar role in catalysis in dnmt3a-cd as r <dig> in m.sssi and r <dig> in m.hhai, which could be positioning of the cytosine for nucleophilic attack by a conserved cys. r <dig> of dnmt3a-cd is important in both catalysis and cytosine flipping. both conserved r <dig> and r <dig> are involved in creating and stabilizing of the transient covalent intermediate of the methylation reaction. n <dig> might contribute to the positioning of the residues from the motif vi, but does not play a direct role in catalysis.
