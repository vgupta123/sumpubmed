BACKGROUND
tgf-beta is one of the key cytokines implicated in various disease processes including cancer. tgf-beta inhibits growth and promotes apoptosis in normal epithelial cells and in contrast, acts as a pro-tumour cytokine by promoting tumour angiogenesis, immune-escape and metastasis. it is not clear if various actions of tgf-beta on normal and tumour cells are due to differential gene regulations. hence we studied the regulation of gene expression by tgf-beta in normal and cancer cells.


RESULTS
using human  <dig> k cdna microarrays, we show that  <dig> genes are exclusively regulated by tgf-beta in a <dig> cells in contrast to  <dig> genes exclusively regulated in hpl1d cells. in addition,  <dig> genes are commonly regulated in both the cell-lines. semi-quantitative and real-time qrt-pcr analysis of some genes agrees with the microarray data. in order to identify the signalling pathways that influence tgf-beta mediated gene regulation, we used specific inhibitors of p <dig> map kinase, erk kinase, jnk kinase and integrin signalling pathways. the data suggest that regulation of majority of the selected genes is dependent on at least one of these pathways and this dependence is cell-type specific. interestingly, an integrin pathway inhibitor, rgd peptide, significantly affected tgf-beta regulation of thrombospondin  <dig> in a <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest major differences with respect to tgf-beta mediated gene regulation in normal and transformed cells and significant role of non-canonical tgf-beta pathways in the regulation of many genes by tgf-beta.
