BACKGROUND
human breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease classified by molecular subtyping into luminal a, luminal b, her2-overexpressing, basal-like, claudin-low and normal-breast like. the routinely applied and standardized immunohistochemical-based surrogates of this classification group together the last three entities as triple-negative breast cancer  that show the most diverse and complex heterogeneity and represent a therapeutic challenge.

in the present work  <dig> feline mammary lesions consisting of feline mammary carcinomas , benign neoplasms, and hyperplastic/dysplastic tissues were evaluated histologically and by immunohistochemistry for expression of basal and luminal cytokeratins , vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, calponin, estrogen receptor  alpha , and progesterone receptor . thirty-seven fmcs with  <dig> matched non-neoplastic controls were also investigated for gene expression of era, er beta, pr, and her <dig> 


RESULTS
a large group of hormone receptors -negative aggressive carcinomas - that did not overexpress her <dig> - could be distinguished from the less aggressive  and benign  hrs + tumors, that showed bilineage  differentiation. immunohistochemical evaluations of cytoplasmic filaments indicated that hrs- fmcs are vimentin+, ck14+, and ck5_6+ carcinomas that may resemble the tnbcs  described in women. the identification of luminal and myoepithelial progenitors within the mammary ductal system suggested potential cells/sites of origin of these tumors. a diffuse and never previously described cks/vimentin luminal cell co-expression was detected in the non-neoplastic ducts, indicating a potential bilineage progenitor.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate and potentially explain the high incidence of triple-negative, vimentin + aggressive tumors in cats that may used to elucidate some of the challenging features of tnbcs in women.
