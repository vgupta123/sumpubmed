BACKGROUND
specific pieces of music can elicit strong emotions in listeners and, possibly in connection with these emotions, can be remembered even years later. however, episodic memory for emotional music compared with less emotional music has not yet been examined. we investigated whether emotional music is remembered better than less emotional music. also, we examined the influence of musical structure on memory performance.


RESULTS
recognition of  <dig> musical excerpts was investigated as a function of arousal, valence, and emotional intensity ratings of the music. in the first session the participants judged valence and arousal of the musical pieces. one week later, participants listened to the  <dig> old and  <dig> new musical excerpts randomly interspersed and were asked to make an old/new decision as well as to indicate arousal and valence of the pieces. musical pieces that were rated as very positive were recognized significantly better.


CONCLUSIONS
musical excerpts rated as very positive are remembered better. valence seems to be an important modulator of episodic long-term memory for music. evidently, strong emotions related to the musical experience facilitate memory formation and retrieval.
