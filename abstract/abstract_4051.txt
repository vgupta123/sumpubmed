BACKGROUND
upland cotton  accounts for about 95% of world cotton production. improving upland cotton cultivars has been the focus of world-wide cotton breeding programs. negative correlation between yield and fiber quality is an obstacle for cotton improvement. random-mating provides a potential methodology to break this correlation. the suite of fiber quality traits that affect the yarn quality includes the length, strength, maturity, fineness, elongation, uniformity and color. identification of stable fiber quantitative trait loci  in upland cotton is essential in order to improve cotton cultivars with superior quality using marker-assisted selection  strategy.


RESULTS
using  <dig> diverse upland cotton cultivars as parents, a random-mated recombinant inbred  population consisting of  <dig> ri lines was developed after 6 cycles of random-mating and  <dig> generations of self-pollination. the  <dig> rils were planted in triplicates for two years in mississippi state, ms, usa to obtain fiber quality data. after screening  <dig> simple sequence repeat  markers,  <dig> were polymorphic among the  <dig> parents. one thousand five hundred eighty-two markers covering 83% of cotton genome were used to genotype  <dig> rils . the marker-trait associations were analyzed using the software program tassel. at p <  <dig> ,  <dig> fiber qtls and  <dig> qtl clusters were identified. these qtls were responsible for the combined phenotypic variance ranging from  <dig> % for short fiber content to  <dig> % for elongation. the other  <dig> rils  were analyzed using a subset of  <dig> ssr markers, and the qtls were confirmed. two major qtl clusters were observed on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  comparison of these  <dig> qtls with the previously published qtls indicated that  <dig> were identified before, and  <dig> appeared novel.


CONCLUSIONS
the  <dig> parents used in this study represent a diverse genetic pool of the us cultivated cotton, and  <dig> of them were elite commercial cultivars. the fiber qtls, especially qtl clusters reported herein can be readily implemented in a cotton breeding program to improve fiber quality via mas strategy. the consensus qtl regions warrant further investigation to better understand the genetics and molecular mechanisms underlying fiber development.
