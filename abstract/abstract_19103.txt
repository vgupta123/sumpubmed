BACKGROUND
porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus  is the major etiological agent of viral enteritis and severe diarrhea in suckling piglets. in china, tgev has caused great economic losses, but its role in epidemic diarrhea is unclear. this study aims to reveal the etiological role of tgev in piglet diarrhea via molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis.


RESULTS
a tgev-hx strain was isolated from china, and its complete genome was amplified, cloned, and sequenced. sequence analysis indicated that it was conserved in the 5′ and 3′-non-translated regions, and there were no insertions or deletions in nonstructural genes, such as orf1a, orf1b, orf3a, orf3b, and orf <dig>  as well as in genes encoding structural proteins, such as the envelope , membrane , and nucleoprotein  proteins. furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis indicated that the tgev-hx strain was more similar to the tgev purdue cluster than to the miller cluster.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study described the isolation and genetic characterization of a tgev-hx strain. the detailed analysis of the genetic variation of tgevs in china provides essential information for further understanding the evolution of tgevs.
