BACKGROUND
candida albicans yeast produces  <dig> distinct secreted aspartic proteases , which are some of the most important virulence factors of this pathogenic fungus. one of the suggested roles of saps is their deregulating effect on various proteolytic cascades that constitute the major homeostatic systems in human hosts, including blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and kallikrein-kinin systems. this study compared the characteristics of the action of all  <dig> saps on human kininogens, which results in generating proinflammatory bradykinin-related peptides .


RESULTS
recombinant forms of saps, heterologously overexpressed in pichia pastoris were applied. except for sap <dig> and sap <dig>  all saps effectively cleaved the kininogens, with the highest hydrolytic activity toward the low-molecular-mass form . sap1– <dig> and  <dig> produced a biologically active kinin—met-lys-bradykinin—and sap <dig> was exceptional in terms of the kinin-releasing yield . des-arg1-bradykinin was released from lk by sap <dig> at a comparably high yield, but this peptide was assumed to be biologically inactive because it was unable to interact with cellular b2-type kinin receptors. however, the collaborative actions of sap <dig> and sap <dig>  − <dig>  −4– <dig>  and − <dig> on lk rerouted kininogen cleavage toward the high-yield release of the biologically active met-lys-bradykinin.


CONCLUSIONS
our present results, together with the available data on the expression of individual sap genes in candidal infection models, suggest a biological potential of saps to produce kinins at the infection foci. the kinin release during candidiasis can involve predominant and complementary contributions of two different sap3- and sap9-dependent mechanisms.
