BACKGROUND
spectral imaging with polarity-sensitive fluorescent probes enables the quantification of cell and model membrane physical properties, including local hydration, fluidity, and lateral lipid packing, usually characterized by the generalized polarization  parameter. with the development of commercial microscopes equipped with spectral detectors, spectral imaging has become a convenient and powerful technique for measuring gp and other membrane properties. the existing tools for spectral image processing, however, are insufficient for processing the large data sets afforded by this technological advancement, and are unsuitable for processing images acquired with rapidly internalized fluorescent probes.


RESULTS
here we present a matlab spectral imaging toolbox with the aim of overcoming these limitations. in addition to common operations, such as the calculation of distributions of gp values, generation of pseudo-colored gp maps, and spectral analysis, a key highlight of this tool is reliable membrane segmentation for probes that are rapidly internalized. furthermore, handling for hyperstacks, 3d reconstruction and batch processing facilitates analysis of data sets generated by time series, z-stack, and area scan microscope operations. finally, the object size distribution is determined, which can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying changes in membrane properties and is desirable for e.g. studies involving model membranes and surfactant coated particles. analysis is demonstrated for cell membranes, cell-derived vesicles, model membranes, and microbubbles with environmentally-sensitive probes laurdan, carboxyl-modified laurdan , di-4-aneppdhq, and di-4-anepptea , for quantification of the local lateral density of lipids or lipid packing.


CONCLUSIONS
the spectral imaging toolbox is a powerful tool for the segmentation and processing of large spectral imaging datasets with a reliable method for membrane segmentation and no ability in programming required. the spectral imaging toolbox can be downloaded from https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/62617-spectral-imaging-toolbox.
