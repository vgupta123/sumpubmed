BACKGROUND
changes in energy metabolism of the cells are common to many kinds of tumors and are considered a hallmark of cancer. gas chromatography followed by time-of-flight mass spectrometry  is a well-suited technique to investigate the small molecules in the central metabolic pathways. however, the metabolic changes between invasive carcinoma and normal breast tissues were not investigated in a large cohort of breast cancer samples so far.


RESULTS
a cohort of  <dig> breast cancer and  <dig> normal tissue samples was investigated using gc-tofms-based metabolomics. a total number of  <dig> metabolite peaks could be detected; out of these  <dig>  were significantly changed between cancer and normal tissues . furthermore,  <dig> tumor and  <dig> normal tissue markers were identified that separated cancer from normal tissues with a sensitivity and a specificity of >80%. two-metabolite classifiers, constructed as ratios of the tumor and normal tissues markers, separated cancer from normal tissues with high sensitivity and specificity. specifically, the cytidine-5-monophosphate / pentadecanoic acid metabolic ratio was the most significant discriminator between cancer and normal tissues and allowed detection of cancer with a sensitivity of  <dig> % and a specificity of  <dig> %.


CONCLUSIONS
for the first time, a comprehensive metabolic map of breast cancer was constructed by gc-tof analysis of a large cohort of breast cancer and normal tissues. furthermore, our results demonstrate that spectrometry-based approaches have the potential to contribute to the analysis of biopsies or clinical tissue samples complementary to histopathology.
