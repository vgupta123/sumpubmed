BACKGROUND
ochrobactrum anthropi , is a non-fermenting gram-negative bacillus usually found in the environment. nevertheless, during the past decade it has been identified as pathogenic to immunocompromised patients. in this study, we assessed the usefulness of the automated repetitive extragenic palindromic-polymerase chain reaction  and of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight  for typing of twentythree o. anthropi clinical isolates that we found over a four-months period  in bacteriemic patients admitted in the same operative unit of our hospital. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , commonly accepted as the gold standard technique for typing, was also used. analysis was carried out using the pearson correlation coefficient to determine the distance matrice and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean  to generate dendogram.


RESULTS
rep-pcr analysis identified four different patterns: three that clustered together with 97% or more pattern similarity, and one whose members showed < 95% pattern similarity. interestingly, strains isolated later  displayed a pattern with 99% similarity. maldi-tof ms evaluation clustered the twentythree strains of o. anthropi into a single group containing four distinct subgroups, each comprising the majority of strains clustering below  <dig> distance levels, indicating a high similarity between the isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that these isolates are clonally-related and the methods used afforded a valuable contribution to the epidemiology, prevention and control of the infections caused by this pathogen.
