BACKGROUND
finding an efficient method to solve the parameter estimation problem  for nonlinear biochemical dynamical systems could help promote the
functional understanding at the system level for signalling pathways. the problem
is stated as a data-driven nonlinear regression problem, which is converted into a
nonlinear programming problem with many nonlinear differential and algebraic
constraints. due to the typical ill conditioning and multimodality nature of the
problem, it is in general difficult for gradient-based local optimization methods
to obtain satisfactory solutions. to surmount this limitation, many stochastic
optimization methods have been employed to find the global solution of the
problem.


RESULTS
this paper presents an effective search strategy for a particle swarm optimization
 algorithm that enhances the ability of the algorithm for estimating the
parameters of complex dynamic biochemical pathways. the proposed algorithm is a
new variant of random drift particle swarm optimization , which is used to
solve the above mentioned inverse problem and compared with other well known
stochastic optimization methods. two case studies on estimating the parameters of
two nonlinear biochemical dynamic models have been taken as benchmarks, under both
the noise-free and noisy simulation data scenarios.


CONCLUSIONS
the experimental results show that the novel variant of rdpso algorithm is able to
successfully solve the problem and obtain solutions of better quality than other
global optimization methods used for finding the solution to the inverse problems
in this study.
