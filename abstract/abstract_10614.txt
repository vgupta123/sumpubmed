BACKGROUND
pulmonary arterial hypertension  is a lethal disease with pronounced narrowing of pulmonary vessels due to abnormal cell proliferation. the platelet-derived growth factor bb  is well known as a potent mitogen for smooth muscle cell proliferation. to better understand how this growth factor regulates pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells  proliferation, we sought to characterize the response to pdgf-bb stimulation at system-wide levels, including the transcriptome and proteome.


RESULTS
in this study, we identified  <dig> mrnas ,  <dig> proteins  differentially expressed in response to pdgf-bb stimulation in pasmcs based on rna-sequencing and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification  assay. transcription factor -target network analysis revealed that pdgf-bb regulated gene expression potentially via tfs including hif1a, jun, est <dig>  ets <dig>  smad <dig>  fos, sp <dig>  stat <dig>  lef <dig> and cebpb. among them, smad1-involved bmpr2/smads axis plays a significant role in pah development. interestingly, we observed that the expression of bmpr <dig> was decreased in both mrna and protein level in response to pdgf-bb. further study revealed that bmpr <dig> is the direct target of mir-376b that is up-regulated upon pdgf-bb treatment. finally, edu incorporation assay showed that mir-376b promoted proliferation of pasmcs.


CONCLUSIONS
this integrated analysis of pdgf-bb-regulated transcriptome and proteome was performed for the first time in normal pasmcs, which revealed a crosstalk between pdgf signaling and bmpr2/smads axis. further study demonstrated that pdgf-bb-induced mir-376b upregulation mediated the downregulation of bmpr <dig>  which led to expression change of its downstream targets and promoted proliferation of pasmcs.
