BACKGROUND
epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological disorders in dogs characterized by recurrent seizures. the endocannabinoid  system plays a central role in suppressing pathologic neuronal excitability and in controlling the spread of activity in an epileptic network. endocannabinoids are released on demand and their dysregulation has been described in several pathological conditions. recurrent seizures may lead to an adverse reorganization of the ec system and impairment of its protective effect. in the current study, we tested the hypothesis that cerebrospinal fluid  concentrations of the endocannabinoids anandamide  and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol  are altered in epileptic dogs. concentrations of aea and total ag  were measured in  <dig> dogs with idiopathic epilepsy and in  <dig> unaffected, healthy control dogs using liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry.


RESULTS
aea and total ag were measured at  <dig>   pm and  <dig>   nm in epileptic dogs and at  <dig>   pm and  <dig>   nm in the control group, respectively . the aea difference between epileptic and healthy dogs was statistically significant . values correlated with seizure severity and duration of seizure activity. dogs with cluster seizures and/or status epilepticus and with seizure activity for more than six months displayed the highest ec concentrations.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we present the first endocannabinoid measurements in canine csf and confirm the hypothesis that the ec system is altered in canine idiopathic epilepsy.
