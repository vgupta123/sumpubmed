BACKGROUND
there is fmri evidence that women are neurally predisposed to process infant laughter and crying. other findings show that women might be more empathic and sensitive than men to emotional facial expressions. however, no gender difference in the brain responses to persons and unanimated scenes has hitherto been demonstrated.


RESULTS
twenty-four men and women viewed  <dig> images portraying persons or landscapes and erps were recorded from  <dig> sites. in women, but not in men, the n <dig> component  was much larger to persons than to scenes. swloreta showed significant bilateral activation of fg  in both genders when viewing persons as opposed to scenes. only women showed a source of activity in the stg and in the right mog , and only men in the left parahippocampal area .


CONCLUSIONS
a significant gender difference was found in activation of the left and right stg  and the cingulate cortex for the subtractive condition women minus men, thus indicating that women might have a greater preference or interest for social stimuli .
