BACKGROUND
identification of genes underlying drought tolerance  quantitative trait loci  will facilitate understanding of molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance, and also will accelerate genetic improvement of pearl millet through marker-assisted selection. we report a map based on genes with assigned functional roles in plant adaptation to drought and other abiotic stresses and demonstrate its use in identifying candidate genes underlying a major dt-qtl.


RESULTS
seventy five single nucleotide polymorphism  and conserved intron spanning primer  markers were developed from available expressed sequence tags  using four genotypes, h 77/833- <dig>  prlt 2/89- <dig>  icmr  <dig> and icmr  <dig>  representing parents of two mapping populations. a total of  <dig> snps were obtained from  <dig>  kb sequenced region resulting in a snp frequency of 1/ <dig> bp. the positions of major pearl millet linkage group   <dig> dt-qtls  were added to the present consensus function map which identified  <dig> genes, coding for psi reaction center subunit iii, phyc, actin, alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase, uridylate kinase, acyl-coa oxidase, dipeptidyl peptidase iv, mads-box, serine/threonine protein kinase, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, zinc finger c- × 8-c × 5-c × 3-h type, hd <dig>  acetyl coa carboxylase, chlorophyll a/b binding protein, photolyase, protein phosphatase <dig> regulatory subunit sds <dig> and two hypothetical proteins, co-mapping in this dt-qtl interval. many of these candidate genes were found to have significant association with qtls of grain yield, flowering time and leaf rolling under drought stress conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
we have exploited available pearl millet est sequences to generate a mapped resource of seventy five new gene-based markers for pearl millet and demonstrated its use in identifying candidate genes underlying a major dt-qtl in this species. the reported gene-based markers represent an important resource for identification of candidate genes for other mapped abiotic stress qtls in pearl millet. they also provide a resource for initiating association studies using candidate genes and also for comparing the structure and function of distantly related plant genomes such as other poaceae members.
