BACKGROUND
the major histocompatibility complex  molecule plays a central role in controlling the adaptive immune response to infections. mhc class i molecules present peptides derived from intracellular proteins to cytotoxic t cells, whereas mhc class ii molecules stimulate cellular and humoral immunity through presentation of extracellularly derived peptides to helper t cells. identification of which peptides will bind a given mhc molecule is thus of great importance for the understanding of host-pathogen interactions, and large efforts have been placed in developing algorithms capable of predicting this binding event.


RESULTS
here, we present a novel artificial neural network-based method, nn-align that allows for simultaneous identification of the mhc class ii binding core and binding affinity. nn-align is trained using a novel training algorithm that allows for correction of bias in the training data due to redundant binding core representation. incorporation of information about the residues flanking the peptide-binding core is shown to significantly improve the prediction accuracy. the method is evaluated on a large-scale benchmark consisting of six independent data sets covering  <dig> human mhc class ii alleles, and is demonstrated to outperform other state-of-the-art mhc class ii prediction methods.


CONCLUSIONS
the nn-align method is competitive with the state-of-the-art mhc class ii peptide binding prediction algorithms. the method is publicly available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/netmhcii- <dig> .
