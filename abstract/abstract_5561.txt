BACKGROUND
tumor models are critical for our understanding of cancer and the development of cancer therapeutics. here, we present an integrated map of the genome, transcriptome and immunome of an epithelial mouse tumor, the ct <dig> colon carcinoma cell line.


RESULTS
we found that kras is homozygously mutated at p.g12d, apc and tp <dig> are not mutated, and cdkn2a is homozygously deleted. proliferation and stem-cell markers, including top2a, birc <dig> , cldn <dig> and mki <dig>  are highly expressed while differentiation and top-crypt markers muc <dig>  ms4a8a  and epcam are not. myc, trp <dig> , mdm <dig>  hif1a, and nras are highly expressed while egfr and flt <dig> are not. mhc class i but not mhc class ii is expressed. several known cancer-testis antigens are expressed, including atad <dig>  cep <dig>  and pbk. the highest expressed gene is a mutated form of the mouse tumor antigen gp <dig>  of the  <dig>  non-synonymous point variations,  <dig> are both in expressed genes and in peptides predicted to bind mhc and thus potential targets for immunotherapy development. based on its molecular signature, we predicted that ct <dig> is refractory to anti-egfr mabs and sensitive to mek and met inhibitors, as have been previously reported.


CONCLUSIONS
ct <dig> cells share molecular features with aggressive, undifferentiated, refractory human colorectal carcinoma cells. as ct <dig> is one of the most extensively used syngeneic mouse tumor models, our data provide a map for the rationale design of mode-of-action studies for pre-clinical evaluation of targeted- and immunotherapies.
