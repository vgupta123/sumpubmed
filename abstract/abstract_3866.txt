BACKGROUND
the gene daf- <dig> encodes the single insulin/insulin growth factor-1-like receptor of caenorhabditis elegans. the reduction-of-function allele e <dig> induces several metabolic alterations and doubles lifespan.


RESULTS
we found that the e <dig> mutation alters aerobic energy production substantially. in wild-type worms the abundance of key mitochondrial proteins declines with age, accompanied by a dramatic decrease in energy production, although the mitochondrial mass, inferred from the mitochondrial dna copy number, remains unaltered. in contrast, the age-dependent decrease of both key mitochondrial proteins and bioenergetic competence is considerably attenuated in daf- <dig> adult animals. the increase in daf- <dig> mitochondrial competence is associated with a higher membrane potential and increased reactive oxygen species production, but with little damage to mitochondrial protein or dna. together these results point to a higher energetic efficiency of daf- <dig> animals.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that low daf- <dig> function alters the overall rate of ageing by a yet unidentified mechanism with an indirect protective effect on mitochondrial function.
