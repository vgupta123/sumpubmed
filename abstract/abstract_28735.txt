BACKGROUND
gypenosides  and ethanol extract of gynostemma pentaphyllum  show anxiolytic effects on affective disorders in 1-methyl-4-phenyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydropyridine-lesioned mouse model of parkinson’s disease . long-term administration of l- <dig> -dihydroxyphenylalanine  leads to the development of severe motor side effects such as l-dopa-induced-dyskinesia  in pd. the present study investigated the effects of gps and gp-ex on lid in a 6-hydroxydopamine -lesioned rat model of pd.


RESULTS
daily administration of l-dopa  in the 6-ohda-lesioned rat model of pd for 22 days induced expression of lid, which was determined by the body and locomotive aims scores and contralateral rotational behaviors. however, co-treatments of gps  or gp-ex  with l-dopa significantly attenuated the development of lid without compromising the anti-parkinsonian effects of l-dopa. in addition, the increases in ∆fosb expression and erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation in 6-ohda-lesioned rats induced by l-dopa administration were significantly reduced by co-treatment with gps  or gp-ex .


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that gps  and gp-ex  effectively attenuate the development of lid by modulating the biomarker activities of ∆fosb expression and erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation in the 6-ohda-lesioned rat model of pd. gps and gp-ex will be useful adjuvant therapeutics for lid in pd.
