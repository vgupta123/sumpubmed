BACKGROUND
infections caused by community-associated strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  are associated with a marked and prolonged host inflammatory response. in a sepsis simulation model, we tested whether the anesthetic ketamine inhibits the macrophage tnf response to antibiotic-exposed ca-mrsa bacteria via its antagonism of n-methyl-d-aspartate  receptors. raw <dig>  cells were stimulated for  <dig> hrs with  <dig> to  <dig> cfu/ml inocula of either of two prototypical ca-mrsa isolates, usa <dig> strain lac and usa <dig> strain mw <dig>  in the presence of either vancomycin or daptomycin. one hour before bacterial stimulation, ketamine was added with or without mk- <dig> , apv , nmda, or combinations of these agents. supernatants were collected and assayed for tnf concentration by elisa.


RESULTS
raw <dig>  cells exposed to either lac or mw <dig> in the presence of daptomycin secreted less tnf than in the presence of vancomycin. the addition of ketamine inhibited macrophage tnf secretion after stimulation with either of the ca-mrsa isolates  in the presence of either antibiotic. the nmda inhibitors, mk- <dig> and apv, also suppressed macrophage tnf secretion after stimulation with either of the antibiotic-exposed ca-mrsa isolates, and the effect was not additive or synergistic with ketamine. the addition of nmda substrate augmented tnf secretion in response to the ca-mrsa bacteria, and the addition of apv suppressed the effect of nmda in a dose-dependent fashion.


CONCLUSIONS
ketamine inhibits tnf secretion by mrsa-stimulated raw <dig>  macrophages and the mechanism likely involves nmda receptor antagonism. these findings may have therapeutic significance in mrsa sepsis.
