BACKGROUND
rip <dig>  pathway was mainly described as the molecular mechanism of necroptosis . but recently, non-rip <dig> pathways were found to mediate necroptosis. we deliberate to investigate the effect of calpain, a molecule to induce necroptosis as reported , in rgc- <dig> following elevated hydrostatic pressure.


RESULTS
first, we identified the existence of necroptosis of rgc- <dig> after insult by using necrostatin- <dig>  detected by flow cytometry. immunofluorescence staining and western blot were used to detect the expression of calpain. western blot analysis was carried out to describe the truncated aif  expression with or without pretreatment of alln . following elevated hydrostatic pressure, necroptotic cells pretreated with or without alln was stained by annexin v/pi, the activity of calpain was also examined to confirm the inhibition effect of alln. the results showed that after cell injury there was an upregulation of calpain expression. upon adding alln, the calpain activity was inhibited, and taif production was reduced upon injury along with the decreased number of necroptosis cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our study found that calpain may induce necroptosis via taif-modulation in rgc- <dig> following elevated hydrostatic pressure.
