BACKGROUND
haplosclerid marine sponges produce pore forming polyalkylpyridinium salts , which can be used to deliver macromolecules into cells. the aim of this study was to investigate the delivery of dna, sirna and lucifer yellow into cells mediated by poly-aps and its potential mechanisms as compared with other lipofection systems ). dna condensation was evaluated and hek  <dig> and htta hela cells were used to investigate pore formation and intracellular delivery of cdna, sirna and lucifer yellow.


RESULTS
poly-aps and lipogen were both found to be highly efficient dna condensing agents. fura- <dig> calcium imaging was used to measure calcium transients indicative of cell membrane pore forming activity. calcium transients were evoked by poly-aps but not lipogen and lipofectamine. the increases in intracellular calcium produced by poly-aps showed temperature sensitivity with greater responses being observed at 12°c compared to 21°c. similarly, delivery of lucifer yellow into cells with poly-aps was enhanced at lower temperatures. transfection with cdna encoding for the expression enhanced green fluorescent protein was also evaluated at 12°c with poly-aps, lipofectamine and lipogen. intracellular delivery of sirna was achieved with knockdown in beta-actin expression when lipofectamine and lipogen were used as transfection reagents. however, intracellular delivery of sirna was not achieved with poly-aps.


CONCLUSIONS
poly-aps mediated pore formation is critical to its activity as a transfection reagent, but lipofection systems utilise distinct mechanisms to enable delivery of dna and sirna into cells.
