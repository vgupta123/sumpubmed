BACKGROUND
seedlessness is an important agronomic trait for citrus, and male sterility  is one main cause of seedless citrus fruit. however, the molecular mechanism of citrus seedlessness remained not well explored.


RESULTS
an integrative strategy combining suppression subtractive hybridization  library with cdna microarray was employed to study the underlying mechanism of seedlessness of a ponkan mandarin seedless mutant . screening with custom microarray, a total of  <dig> differentially expressed clones were identified, and  <dig> unigenes  were obtained after sequencing. gene ontology  distribution based on biological process suggested that the majority of differential genes are involved in metabolic process and respond to stimulus and regulation of biology process; based on molecular function they function as dna/rna binding or have catalytic activity and oxidoreductase activity. a gene encoding male sterility-like protein was highly up-regulated in the seedless mutant compared with the wild type, while several transcription factors  such as ap2/erebp, myb, wrky, nac and c2c2-gata zinc-finger domain tfs were down-regulated.


CONCLUSIONS
our research highlighted some candidate pathways that participated in the citrus male gametophyte development and could be beneficial for seedless citrus breeding in the future.
