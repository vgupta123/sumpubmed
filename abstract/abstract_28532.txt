BACKGROUND
microrna <dig>  is a highly conserved family of mirnas implicated in a wide range of cellular and physiological processes in plants. mir <dig> family generally comprises multiple mir <dig> members in plants, which might exhibit functional redundancy and specificity. the soybean mir <dig> family consists of  <dig> members according to the mirbase database. however, the evolutionary conservation and functional diversification of mir <dig> family members in soybean remain poorly understood.


RESULTS
we identified five novel mir166s in soybean by data mining approach, thus enlarging the size of mir <dig> family from  <dig> to  <dig> members. phylogenetic analyses of the  <dig> mir166s and their precursors indicated that soybean mir <dig> family exhibited both evolutionary conservation and diversification, and ten pairs of mir <dig> precursors with high sequence identity were individually grouped into a discrete clade in the phylogenetic tree. the analysis of genomic organization and evolution of mir <dig> gene family revealed that eight segmental duplications and four tandem duplications might occur during evolution of the mir <dig> family in soybean. the cis-elements in promoters of mir <dig> family genes and their putative targets pointed to their possible contributions to the functional conservation and diversification. the targets of soybean mir166s were predicted, and the cleavage of athb14-like transcript was experimentally validated by race pcr. further, the expression patterns of the five newly identified mir166s and  <dig> target genes were examined during seed development and in response to abiotic stresses, which provided important clues for dissecting their functions and isoform specificity.


CONCLUSIONS
this study enlarged the size of soybean mir <dig> family from  <dig> to  <dig> members, and the  <dig> soybean mir166s exhibited evolutionary conservation and diversification. these findings have laid a foundation for elucidating functional conservation and diversification of mir <dig> family members, especially during seed development or under abiotic stresses.
