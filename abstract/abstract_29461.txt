BACKGROUND
the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of β-glucan on the expression of inflammatory mediators and metabolomic profile of oral cells  infected by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the periodontopathogen was applied and allowed to cross the top layer of cells  to reach the bottom layer of cells  and induce the synthesis of immune factors and cytokines in the host cells. β-glucan  were added, and the transcriptional factors and metabolites produced were quantified in the remaining cell layers and supernatant.


RESULTS
the relative expression of interleukin -1-α and il- <dig> genes in hgf- <dig> decreased with 10 μg/ml or 20 μg/ml of β-glucan, where as the expression of ptgs- <dig> decreased only with 10 μg/ml. the expression of il-1-α increased with 20 μg/ml and that of il- <dig> increased with 10 μg/ml in oba-9; the expression of bcl  <dig>  ep  <dig>  and ptgs- <dig> decreased with the higher dose of β-glucan. the production of the metabolite 4-aminobutyric acid presented lower concentrations under 20 μg/ml, whereas the concentrations of 2-deoxytetronic acid nist and oxalic acid decreased at both concentrations used. acetophenone, benzoic acid, and pinitol presented reduced concentrations only when treated with 10 μg/ml of β-glucan.


CONCLUSIONS
treatment with β-glucans positively modulated the immune response and production of metabolites.
