BACKGROUND
postnatal expansion of the pancreatic β-cell mass is required to maintain glucose homeostasis immediately after birth. this β-cell expansion is regulated by multiple growth factors, including glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor  and epidermal growth factor . these mitogens signal through several downstream pathways  to regulate the survival and proliferation of β-cells. survivin, an oncofetal protein with both pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic properties, is a known transcriptional target of both igf- <dig> and egf in cancer cells. here, we analyzed the effects of the β-cell mitogens igf- <dig> and egf on survivin regulation in the established pancreatic β-cell model cell lines, min <dig> and ins- <dig> and in primary mouse islets.


RESULTS
in pancreatic β-cells, treatment with glucose, insulin, or egf increased survivin protein levels at early time points. by contrast, no significant effects on survivin were observed following igf- <dig> treatment. egf-stimulated increases in survivin protein were abrogated in the presence of downstream inhibitors of the raf-1/mek/erk pathway. egf had no significant effect on survivin transcription however it prolonged the half-life of the survivin protein and stabilized survivin protein levels by inhibiting surviving ubiquitination.


CONCLUSIONS
this study defines a novel mechanism of survivin regulation by egf through the raf-1/mek/erk pathway in pancreatic β-cells, via prolongation of survivin protein half-life and inhibition of the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation pathway. this mechanism may be important for regulating β-cell expansion after birth.
