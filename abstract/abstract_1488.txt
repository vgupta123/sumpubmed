BACKGROUND
rap proteins belong to the ras family of small g-proteins. dictyostelium rapa is essential and implicated in processes throughout the life cycle. in early development and chemotaxis competent cells rapa induces pseudopod formation by activating pi3k and it regulates substrate attachment and myosin disassembly via the serine/threonine kinase phg <dig>  rapa is also important in late development, however so far little is known about the downstream effectors of rapa that play a role in this process.


RESULTS
here we show that cells expressing constitutively active rapa exhibit a high level of rac activation. with a pull-down screen coupled to mass spectrometry, we identified the rac specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, gxcc, as rap binding partner. gxcc binds directly and specifically to active rapa and binds to a subset of dictyostelium rac proteins. deletion studies revealed that this pathway is involved in regulating dictyostelium development.


CONCLUSIONS
gxcc provides a novel link between rap and rac signalling and is one of the rap effectors regulating the progression of multicellular development.
