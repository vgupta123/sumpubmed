BACKGROUND
heat shock proteins  constitute an important component in the heat shock response of all living systems. among the various plant hsps , hsp <dig> or small hsps  are expressed in maximal amounts under high temperature stress. the characteristic feature of the shsps is the presence of α-crystallin domain  at the c-terminus. shsps cooperate with hsp100/hsp <dig> and co-chaperones in atp-dependent manner in preventing aggregation of cellular proteins and in their subsequent refolding. database search was performed to investigate the shsp gene family across rice genome sequence followed by comprehensive expression analysis of these genes.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> α-crystallin domain containing genes in rice. phylogenetic analysis showed that  <dig> out of these  <dig> genes constitute shsps. the additional  <dig> genes containing acd clustered with acd proteins of arabidopsis. detailed scrutiny of  <dig> shsp sequences enabled us to categorize these proteins in a revised scheme of classification constituting of  <dig> cytoplasmic/nuclear,  <dig> er,  <dig> mitochondrial,  <dig> plastid and  <dig> peroxisomal genes. in the new classification proposed herein nucleo-cytoplasmic class of shsps with  <dig> subfamilies is more complex in rice than in arabidopsis. strikingly,  <dig> of  <dig> rice shsp genes were noted to be intronless. expression analysis based on microarray and rt-pcr showed that  <dig> shsp genes were upregulated by high temperature stress. besides heat stress, expression of shsp genes was up or downregulated by other abiotic and biotic stresses. in addition to stress regulation, various shsp genes were differentially upregulated at different developmental stages of the rice plant. majority of shsp genes were expressed in seed.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified twenty three shsp genes and seventeen acd genes in rice. three nucleocytoplasmic shsp genes were found only in monocots. analysis of expression profiling of shsp genes revealed that these genes are differentially expressed under stress and at different stages in the life cycle of rice plant.
