BACKGROUND
the prevalence of infections with mycobacterium tuberculosis  and nontuberculous mycobacteria  species in hiv-infected patients in mexico is unknown. the aims of this study were to determine the frequency of mtb and ntm species in hiv-infected patients from mexico city, to evaluate the genotypic diversity of the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains, to determine their drug resistance profiles by colorimetric microplate alamar blue assay , and finally, to detect mutations present in katg, rpob and inha genes, resulting in isoniazid  and rifampin  resistance.


RESULTS
of the  <dig> mycobacterial strains isolated,  <dig> were identified as mtb,  <dig> as m. bovis,  <dig> as m. avium and  <dig> as m. intracellulare. is6110-rflp of  <dig> mtb strains showed  <dig> profiles. spoligotyping of the  <dig> mtb strains yielded  <dig> patterns, and  <dig> m. bovis strains produced  <dig> patterns. eleven new spoligotypes patterns were found. a total of  <dig> patterns were produced from the  <dig> mtb strains when miru-vntr was performed. nineteen  mtb strains were resistant to one or more drugs. one  multidrug-resistant  strain was identified. a novel mutation was identified in a rif-resistant strain, gag â†’ tcg  at codon  <dig> of rpob gene.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first molecular analysis of mycobacteria isolated from hiv-infected patients in mexico, which describe the prevalence of different mycobacterial species in this population. a high genetic diversity of mtb strains was identified. new spoligotypes and miru-vntr patterns as well as a novel mutation associated to rif-resistance were found. this information will facilitate the tracking of different mycobacterial species in hiv-infected individuals, and monitoring the spread of these microorganisms, leading to more appropriate measures for tuberculosis control.
