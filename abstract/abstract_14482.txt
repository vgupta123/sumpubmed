BACKGROUND
gastrointestinal stromal tumors  represent the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. about 85% carry an activating mutation in the kit or pdgfra gene. approximately 10% of gist are so-called wild type gist  without mutations in the hot spots. in the present study we evaluated appropriate reference genes for the expression analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and fresh frozen samples from gastrointestinal stromal tumors. we evaluated the gene expression of kit as well as of the alternative receptor tyrosine kinase genes flt <dig>  csf1-r, pdgfrb, axl and met by qpcr. wt-gist were compared to samples with mutations in kit exon  <dig> and  <dig> and pdgfra exon  <dig> in order to evaluate whether overexpression of these alternative rtk might contribute to the pathogenesis of wt-gist.


RESULTS
gene expression variability of the pooled cdna samples is much lower than the single reverse transcription cdna synthesis. by combining the lowest variability values of fixed and fresh tissue, the genes polr2a, ppia, rplpo and tfrc were chosen for further analysis of the gist samples. overexpression of kit compared to the corresponding normal tissue was detected in each gist subgroup except in gist with pdgfra exon  <dig> mutation. comparing our sample groups, no significant differences in the gene expression levels of flt <dig>  csf1r and axl were determined. an exception was the sample group with kit exon  <dig> mutation. a significantly reduced expression of csf1r, flt <dig> and pdgfrb compared to the normal tissue was detected. gist with mutations in kit exon  <dig> and  <dig> and in pdgfra exon  <dig> showed a significant pdgfrb downregulation.


CONCLUSIONS
as the variability of expression levels for the reference genes is very high comparing fresh frozen and formalin-fixed tissue there is a strong need for validation in each tissue type. none of the alternative receptor tyrosine kinases analyzed is associated with the pathogenesis of wild-type or mutated gist. it remains to be clarified whether an autocrine or paracrine mechanism by overexpression of receptor tyrosine kinase ligands is responsible for the tumorigenesis of wt-gist.
