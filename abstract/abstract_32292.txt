BACKGROUND
widely distributed species with populations adapted to different environmental conditions can provide valuable opportunities for tracing the onset of reproductive incompatibilities and their role in the speciation process. drosophila montana, a d. virilis group species found in high latitude boreal forests in nearctic and palearctic regions around the globe, could be an excellent model system for studying the early stages of speciation, as a wealth of information concerning this species' ecology, mating system, life history, genetics and phylogeography is available. however, reproductive barriers between populations have hereto not been investigated.


RESULTS
we report both pre- and postmating barriers to reproduction between flies from european  and north american  populations of drosophila montana. using a series of mate-choice designs, we show that flies from these two populations mate assortatively  while emphasizing the importance of experimental design in these kinds of studies. we also assessed potential postmating isolation by quantifying egg and progeny production in intra- and interpopulation crosses and show a significant one-way reduction in progeny production, affecting both male and female offspring equally.


CONCLUSIONS
we provide evidence that allopatric d. montana populations exhibit reproductive isolation and we discuss the potential mechanisms involved. our data emphasize the importance of experimental design in studies on premating isolation between recently diverged taxa and suggest that postmating barriers may be due to postcopulatory-prezygotic mechanisms. d. montana populations seem to be evolving multiple barriers to gene flow in allopatry and our study lays the groundwork for future investigations of the genetic and phenotypic mechanisms underlying these barriers.
