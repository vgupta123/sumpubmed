BACKGROUND
the recent access to a large set of genome sequences, combined with a robust evolutionary scenario of modern monocot  and eudicot  species from their founder ancestors, offered the opportunity to gain insights into disease resistance genes  evolutionary plasticity.


RESULTS
we unravel in the current article  a r-genes repertoire consisting in  <dig> for monocots and  <dig> for eudicots,  a contrasted r-genes conservation with  <dig> % for monocots and  <dig> % for dicots,  a minimal ancestral founder pool of  <dig> r-genes for the monocots and  <dig> r-genes for the eudicots,  a general pattern of organization in clusters accounting for more than 60% of mapped r-genes,  a biased deletion of ancestral duplicated r-genes between paralogous blocks possibly compensated by clusterization,  a bias in r-genes clusterization where leucine-rich repeats act as a ‘glue’ for domain association,  a r-genes/mirnas interome enriched toward duplicated r-genes.


CONCLUSIONS
together, our data may suggest that r-genes family plasticity operated during plant evolution  at the structural level through massive duplicates loss counterbalanced by massive clusterization following polyploidization; as well as at  the regulation level through microrna/r-gene interactions acting as a possible source of functional diploidization of structurally retained r-genes duplicates. such evolutionary shuffling events leaded to cnvs  and pavs  between related species operating in the decay of r-genes colinearity between plant species.
