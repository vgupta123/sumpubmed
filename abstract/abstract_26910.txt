BACKGROUND
r-spondin <dig>  is a novel regulator of the wnt/Î²-catenin signalling pathway. loss-of-function mutations in human rspo <dig> cause testicular differentiation in  <dig>  xx females, pointing to a role in ovarian development. here we report the cloning and comparative expression analysis of r-spondin <dig> orthologues in the mouse, chicken and red-eared slider turtle, three species with different sex-determining mechanisms. evidence is presented that this gene is an ancient component of the vertebrate ovary-determining pathway.


RESULTS
gonadal rspo <dig> gene expression is female up-regulated in the embryonic gonads in each species at the onset of sexual differentiation. in the mouse gonad, rspo <dig> mrna is expressed in the somatic cell lineage at the time of ovarian differentiation , with little expression in germ cells. however, the protein is localised in the cytoplasm and at the cell surface of both somatic  and germ cells. in the chicken embryo, rspo <dig> expression becomes elevated in females at the time of ovarian differentiation, coinciding with female-specific activation of the foxl <dig> gene and estrogen synthesis. rspo <dig> protein in chicken is localised in the outer cortical zone of the developing ovary, the site of primordial follicle formation and germ cell differentiation. inhibition of estrogen synthesis with a specific aromatase inhibitor results in a decline in chicken rspo <dig> expression, indicating that rspo <dig> is influenced by estrogen. in the red-eared slider turtle, which exhibits temperature-dependent sex determination, up-regulation of rspo <dig> occurs during the temperature-sensitive period, when gonadal development is responsive to temperature. accordingly, rspo <dig> expression is temperature-responsive, and is down-regulated in embryos shifted from female- to male-producing incubation temperatures.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that rspo <dig> is up-regulated in the embryonic gonads of female vertebrates with different sex-determining mechanisms. in all instances, rspo <dig> is expressed in the incipient ovary. these findings suggest that r-spondin <dig> is an ancient, conserved part of the vertebrate ovary-determining pathway.
