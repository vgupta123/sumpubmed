BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small non-coding rna molecules with an important role upon post-transcriptional regulation. these molecules have been shown essential for several cellular processes in vertebrates, including muscle biology. many mirnas were described as exclusively or highly expressed in skeletal and/or cardiac muscle. however, knowledge on the genomic organization and evolution of muscle mirnas has been unveiled in a reduced number of vertebrates and mostly only reflects their organization in mammals, whereas fish genomes remain largely uncharted. the main goal of this study was to elucidate particular features in the genomic organization and the putative evolutionary history of muscle mirnas through a genome-wide comparative analysis of cartilaginous and bony fish genomes.


RESULTS
as major outcomes we show that  mir- <dig> was unexpectedly absent in cartilaginous and ray-finned fish genomes whereas it still exist in other vertebrate groups;  mir- <dig> was intergenic in medaka and stickleback conversely to other vertebrates where this mirna is intronic;  the zebrafish genome is the unique harboring two extra paralogous copies of mir- <dig> and their host gene ;  a rare deletion event of the intergenic and bicistronic cluster mir-1-1/133a- <dig> took place only into tetraodontiformes genomes ;  the zebrafish genome experienced a duplication event of mir-206/-133b; and  mir- <dig> was specifically duplicated in species belonging to superorder acanthopterygii.


CONCLUSIONS
despite of the aforementioned singularities in fish genomes, large syntenic blocks containing muscle-enriched mirnas were found to persist, denoting colligated functionality between mirnas and neighboring genes. based on the genomic data here obtained, we envisioned a feasible scenario for explaining muscle mirnas evolution in vertebrates.
