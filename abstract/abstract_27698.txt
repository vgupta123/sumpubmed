BACKGROUND
the genetic basis of virulence in mycobacterium tuberculosis has been investigated through genome comparisons of virulent  and attenuated  sister strains. such analysis, however, relies heavily on the accuracy of the sequences. while the h37rv reference genome has had several corrections to date, that of h37ra is unmodified since its original publication.


RESULTS
here, we report the assembly and finishing of the h37ra genome from single-molecule, real-time  sequencing. our assembly reveals that the number of h37ra-specific variants is less than half of what the sanger-based h37ra reference sequence indicates, undermining and, in some cases, invalidating the conclusions of several studies. pe_ppe family genes, which are intractable to commonly-used sequencing platforms because of their repetitive and gc-rich nature, are overrepresented in the set of genes in which all reported h37ra-specific variants are contradicted. further, one of the sequencing errors in h37ra masks a true variant in common with the clinical strain cdc <dig> which, when considered in the context of previous work, corresponds to a sequencing error in the h37rv reference genome.


CONCLUSIONS
our results constrain the set of genomic differences possibly affecting virulence by more than half, which focuses laboratory investigation on pertinent targets and demonstrates the power of smrt sequencing for producing high-quality reference genomes.
