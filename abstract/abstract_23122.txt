BACKGROUND
contrast-enhanced diagnostic imaging techniques are considered useful in veterinary and human medicine to evaluate liver perfusion and focal hepatic lesions. although hepatic diseases are a common occurrence in reptile medicine, there is no reference to the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound  and contrast-enhanced computed tomography  to evaluate the liver in lizards. therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of change in echogenicity and attenuation of the liver in green iguanas  after administration of specific contrast media.


RESULTS
an increase in liver echogenicity and density was evident during ceus and cect, respectively. in ceus, the mean ± sd  peak enhancement was  <dig> % ±  <dig>  . time to peak enhancement was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   seconds. during cect, first visualization of the contrast medium was at  <dig>  ±  <dig>   seconds in the aorta,  <dig>  ±  <dig>   seconds in the hepatic arteries, and 15 ±  <dig>   seconds in the liver parenchyma. time to peak was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and 31 ±  <dig>   seconds in the aorta and the liver parenchyma, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
ceus and dynamic cect are practical means to determine liver hemodynamics in green iguanas. distribution of contrast medium in iguana differed from mammals. specific reference ranges of hepatic perfusion for diagnostic evaluation of the liver in iguanas are necessary since the use of mammalian references may lead the clinician to formulate incorrect diagnostic suspicions.
