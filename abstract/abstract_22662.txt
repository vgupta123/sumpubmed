BACKGROUND
paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a dimorphic fungus that causes the most prevalent systemic mycosis in latin america. the response to heat shock is involved in pathogenesis, as this pathogen switches from mycelium to yeast forms in a temperature dependent fashion that is essential to establish infection. hsp <dig> is a molecular chaperone that helps in the folding and stabilization of selected polypeptides. hsp <dig> family members have been shown to present important roles in fungi, especially in the pathogenic species, as an immunodominant antigen and also as a potential antifungal therapeutic target.


RESULTS
in this work, we decided to further study the pbhsp <dig> gene, its expression and role in cell viability because it plays important roles in fungal physiology and pathogenesis. thus, we have sequenced a pbhsp <dig> cdna and shown that this gene is present on the genome as a single copy. we have also confirmed its preferential expression in the yeast phase and its overexpression during dimorphic transition and oxidative stress. treatment of the yeast with the specific hsp <dig> inhibitors geldanamycin and radicicol inhibited growth at  <dig> and  <dig> Î¼m, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the data confirm that the pbhsp <dig> gene encodes a morphologically regulated and stress-responsive protein whose function is essential to cell viability of this pathogen. this work also enforces the potential of hsp <dig> as a target for antifungal therapies, since the use of hsp <dig> inhibitors is lethal to the p. brasiliensis yeast cells in a dose-responsive manner.
