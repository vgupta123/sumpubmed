BACKGROUND
geographic selection mosaics, in which species exert different evolutionary impacts on each other in different environments, may drive diversification in coevolving species. we studied the potential for geographic selection mosaics in plant-mycorrhizal interactions by testing whether the interaction between bishop pine  and one of its common ectomycorrhizal fungi  varies in outcome, when different combinations of plant and fungal genotypes are tested under a range of different abiotic and biotic conditions.


RESULTS
we used a  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> factorial experiment to test the main and interactive effects of plant lineage , fungal lineage , soil type , and non-mycorrhizal microbes  on the performance of plants and fungi. ecological outcomes, as assessed by plant and fungal performance, varied widely across experimental environments, including interactions between plant or fungal lineages and soil environmental factors.


CONCLUSIONS
these results show the potential for selection mosaics in plant-mycorrhizal interactions, and indicate that these interactions are likely to coevolve in different ways in different environments, even when initially the genotypes of the interacting species are the same across all environments. hence, selection mosaics may be equally as effective as genetic differences among populations in driving divergent coevolution among populations of interacting species.
