BACKGROUND
rna-seq methodology is a revolutionary transcriptomics sequencing technology, which is the representative of next generation sequencing . with the high throughput sequencing of rna-seq, we can acquire much more information like differential expression and novel splice variants from deep sequence analysis and data mining. but the short read length brings a great challenge to alignment, especially when the reads span two or more exons.

methods
a two steps heuristic splice alignment tool is generated in this investigation. first, map raw reads to reference with unspliced aligner - bwa; second, split initial unmapped reads into three equal short reads , align each seed to the reference, filter hits, search possible split position of read and extend hits to a complete match.


RESULTS
compare with other splice alignment tools like soapsplice and tophat <dig>  hsa has a better performance in call rate and efficiency, but its results do not as accurate as the other software to some extent.


CONCLUSIONS
hsa is an effective spliced aligner of rna-seq reads mapping, which is available at https://github.com/vlcc/hsa.
