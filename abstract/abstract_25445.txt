BACKGROUND
the goal of this study was describing the temporal evolution of aujeszky's disease virus  contact prevalence among eurasian wild boar  populations under different management regimes and contact likelihoods with domestic pigs. given the recent increase in wild boar abundance throughout europe, we hypothesized that wild boar contact with adv would remain stable in time even after significant reduction of adv prevalence in domestic pigs.


RESULTS
sera from  <dig> wild boar were collected from  <dig> to  <dig> within  <dig> areas of the iberian peninsula and tested for the presence of antibodies against adv by elisa. according to sampling date, wild boar were grouped into three time periods. adv prevalence was compared through period both globally and by geographic area. overall seroprevalence for the ten-year study period was  <dig>  Â±  <dig> %. the highest seroprevalence was recorded in areas with intense wild boar management. the annual proportion of positive wild boar sampling sites remained stable through the study period, while the percentage of domestic pig ad positive counties decreased from 70% in  <dig> to  <dig> % in  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
results presented herein confirmed our hypothesis that adv would remain almost stable in wild boar populations. this evidences the increasing risk wild boar pose in the final stages of adv eradication in pigs and for wildlife conservation.
