BACKGROUND
the reproductive phenology of perennial plants in temperate climates is largely conditioned by the duration of bud dormancy, and fruit developmental processes. bud dormancy release and bud break depends on the perception of cumulative chilling and heat during the bud development. the objective of this work was to identify new quantitative trait loci  associated to temperature requirements for bud dormancy release and flowering and to fruit harvest date, in a segregating population of peach.


RESULTS
we have identified qtls for nine traits related to bud dormancy, flowering and fruit harvest in an intraspecific hybrid population of peach in two locations differing in chilling time accumulation. qtls were located in a genetic linkage map of peach based on single nucleotide polymorphism  markers for eight linkage groups  of the peach genome sequence. qtls for chilling requirements for dormancy release and blooming clustered in seven different genomic regions that partially coincided with loci identified in previous works. the most significant qtl for chilling requirements mapped to lg <dig>  close to the evergrowing locus. qtls for heat requirement related traits were distributed in nine genomic regions, four of them co-localizing with qtls for chilling requirement trait. two major loci in lg <dig> and lg <dig> determined fruit harvest time.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified qtls associated to nine traits related to the reproductive phenology in peach. a search of candidate genes for these qtls rendered different genes related to flowering regulation, chromatin modification and hormone signalling. a better understanding of the genetic factors affecting crop phenology might help scientists and breeders to predict changes in genotype performance in a context of global climate change.
