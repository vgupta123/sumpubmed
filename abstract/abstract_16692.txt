BACKGROUND
the maternal contribution of transcripts and proteins supplied to the zygote is crucial for the progression from a gametic to an embryonic control of preimplantation development. here we compared the transcriptional profiles of two types of mouse mii oocytes, one which is developmentally competent , the other that ceases development at the 2-cell stage , with the aim of identifying genes and gene expression networks whose misregulated expression would contribute to a reduced developmental competence.


RESULTS
we report that: 1) the transcription factor oct- <dig> is absent in miinsn oocytes, accounting for 2) the down-regulation of stella, a maternal-effect factor required for the oocyte-to-embryo transition and of which oct- <dig> is a positive regulator; 3) eighteen oct-4-regulated genes are up-regulated in miinsn oocytes and are part of gene expression networks implicated in the activation of adverse biochemical pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis.


CONCLUSIONS
the down-regulation of oct- <dig> plays a crucial function in a sequence of molecular processes that leads to the developmental arrest of miinsn oocytes. the use of a model study in which the mii oocyte ceases development consistently at the 2-cell stage has allowed to attribute a role to the maternal oct- <dig> that has never been described before. oct- <dig> emerges as a key regulator of the molecular events that govern the establishment of the developmental competence of mouse oocytes.
