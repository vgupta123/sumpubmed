BACKGROUND
endogenous retrovirus-like elements  are a diverse group of reiterated sequences related to foamy viruses and widely distributed among mammals. as shown in previous investigations, in many primates and rodents this class of elements has remained transpositionally active, as reflected by increased copy number and high sequence diversity within and among taxa.


RESULTS
here we examine whether proviral-like sequences may be suitable molecular probes for investigating the phylogeny of groups known to have high element diversity. as a test we characterized erv-ls occurring in a sample of extant members of superorder uranotheria . the erv-l complement in this group is even more diverse than previously suspected, and there is sequence evidence for active expansion, particularly in elephantids. many of the elements characterized have protein coding potential suggestive of activity.


CONCLUSIONS
in general, the evidence supports the hypothesis that the complement had a single origin within basal uranotheria.
