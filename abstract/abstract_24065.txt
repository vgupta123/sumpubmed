BACKGROUND
the toll-like receptors represent a large superfamily of type i transmembrane glycoproteins, some common to a wide range of species and others are more restricted in their distribution. most members of the toll-like receptor superfamily have few paralogues; the exception is the tlr <dig> gene family with four closely related genes in mammals tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  and four in birds tlr1a, tlr1b, tlr2a and tlr2b. these genes were previously thought to have arisen by a series of independent gene duplications. to understand the evolutionary pattern of the tlr <dig> gene family in vertebrates further, we cloned the sequences of tlr1a, tlr1b, tlr2a and tlr2b in duck and turkey, constructed phylogenetic trees, predicted codons under positive selection and identified co-evolutionary amino acid pairs within the tlr <dig> gene family using sequences from  <dig> birds,  <dig> mammals, an amphibian and a fish.


RESULTS
this detailed phylogenetic analysis not only clarifies the gene gains and losses within the tlr <dig> gene family of birds and mammals, but also defines orthologues between these vertebrates. in mammals, we predict amino acid sites under positive selection in tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> but not tlr <dig>  we detect co-evolution between amino acid residues in tlr <dig> and the other members of this gene family predicted to maintain their ability to form functional heterodimers. in birds, we predict positive selection in the tlr2a and tlr2b genes at functionally significant amino acid residues. we demonstrate that the tlr <dig> gene family has mostly been subject to purifying selection but has also responded to directional selection at a few sites, possibly in response to pathogen challenge.


CONCLUSIONS
our phylogenetic and structural analyses of the vertebrate tlr <dig> family have clarified their evolutionary origins and predict amino acid residues likely to be important in the host's defense against invading pathogens.
