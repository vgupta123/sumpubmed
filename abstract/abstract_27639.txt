BACKGROUND
cancer stem cells  are able to self-renew and to form metastases. using flow cytometry, cscs were detected in canine mammary tumors as cells cd44+ and cd24-. the aim of this study was to detect these cscs by immunohistochemistry and correlate their frequency with canine mammary neoplasm grade and histopathological type.

 <dig> mammary neoplasm samples were selected from tissue blocks at the department of pathology at unesp and classified according to . these samples were composed by adenomas, lymph node metastases, solid carcinomas grades ii and iii, tubular, papillary and carcinomas in mixed tumor grades i, ii and iii. immunohistochemistry was performed with antibodies against cd <dig> and cd <dig>  linear regression was performed using pearsonâ€™s correlation test.


RESULTS
the value at cd <dig> was positive and cd <dig> becomes zero was  <dig> %. cells with a cd44+/cd24- phenotype were detected in  <dig> out of  <dig> samples with an advantage of high grade tumors  and metastases among tubular, papillary and carcinomas in mixed tumors. in these samples, percentages of cells stained by cd <dig> and cd <dig> antibodies were  <dig> % and 0%, respectively. published reports usually correlate grade iii tumors with the expression of cd <dig> but not with cd <dig> expression. studies using flow cytometry have found csc frequencies similar to those found in our study.


CONCLUSIONS
immunohistochemistry was found to be a reliable technique for the detection of cscs in canine mammary neoplasms, and the frequency of these cells positively correlates with grades ii and iii tumors .
