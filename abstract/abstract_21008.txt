BACKGROUND
in dogs, occurrence of lipid metabolism disorders such as obesity and diabetes mellitus has increased markedly in recent years. hyperlipidemia has been regarded as a common characteristic for obese animals and hyperlipidemic condition may be associated with inflammation, oxidative stress and lipid composition changes. in this study, we investigated the changes in plasma cholesterol and triglyceride  profiles and metabolite concentrations in  <dig> dogs .


RESULTS
plasma adiponectin  concentrations were significantly lower in aged dogs than those in young dogs . although there were no significant differences statistically, aged dogs showed significantly higher plasma alpha1- acid glycoprotein  levels compared to those in young dogs. plasma cholesterol lipoprotein and tg lipoprotein were divided into four fractions by biphasic agarose gel electrophoresis technique. the levels of the third tg-lipoprotein fraction from the positive pole  were significantly higher in aged dogs than in young dogs . on the correlation coefficient analysis by peasonâ€™s method, moderate positive correlations were seen between the age and tg , tg fraction  <dig> , malondialdehyde , alpha- <dig> ag  levels, respectively. moderate negative correlations were seen the age and total cholesterol  fraction  <dig> , glucose , adn , respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
present data suggest biochemical characteristics of lipid metabolism disorder may be affected by aging in dogs.
