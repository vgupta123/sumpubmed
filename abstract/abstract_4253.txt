BACKGROUND
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder, caused by progressive loss of motor neurons. changes are widespread in the subcortical white matter in als. diffusion tensor imaging  detects pathological changes in white matter fibres in vivo, based on alterations in the degree  and directedness  of proton movement.

methods
 <dig> patients with als and  <dig> age-matched controls received  <dig> t dti. fa and adc were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping. in  <dig> of the  <dig> als patients, a second dti was obtained after  <dig> months.


RESULTS
decreased fa in the corticospinal tract  and frontal areas confirm existing results. with a direct comparison of baseline and follow-up dataset, the progression of upper motor neuron degeneration, reflected in fa decrease, could be captured along the cst and in frontal areas. the involvement of cerebellum in the pathology of als, as suspected from functional mri studies, could be confirmed by a reduced fa . these structural changes correlated well with disease duration, alsfrs-r, and physical and executive functions.


CONCLUSIONS
dti detects changes that are regarded as prominent features of als and thus, shows promise in its function as a biomarker. using the technique herein, we could demonstrate dti changes at follow-up which correlated well with clinical progression.
