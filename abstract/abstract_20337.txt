BACKGROUND
down syndrome  or trisomy  <dig> is the result of a genetic dosage imbalance that translates in a broad clinical spectrum. a major challenge in the study of ds is the identification of functional genetic elements with wide impact on phenotypic alterations. recently, mirnas have been recognized as major contributors to several disease conditions by acting as post-transcriptional regulators of a plethora of genes. five chromosome  <dig>  mirnas have been found overexpressed in ds individuals and could function as key elements in the pathophysiology. interestingly, in the trisomic ts65dn ds mouse model two of these mirnas  are also triplicated and overexpressed in brain.


RESULTS
in the current work, we interrogated the impact of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> upregulation on the transcriptome of ts65dn brains. we developed a lentiviral mirna-sponge strategy  to identify in vivo relevant mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> target mrnas. hippocampal injections of lentiviral sponges in ts65dn mice normalized the expression of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> and rescued the levels of their targets methyl-cpg-binding protein  <dig> gene , sh <dig> -containing inositol phosphatase- <dig>  and forkhead box protein m <dig> . transcriptomic data of lv-mir155-802t mirna-sponge treated hippocampi correlated with candidate targets highlighting mirna dosage-sensitive genes. significant associations were found in a subset of genes  that could be experimentally validated.


CONCLUSIONS
the lentiviral mirna-sponge strategy demonstrated the genome-wide regulatory effects of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  furthermore, the analysis combining predicted candidates and experimental transcriptomic data proved to retrieve genes with potential significance in ds-hippocampal phenotype bridging with ds other neurological-associated diseases such as alzheimer’s disease.
