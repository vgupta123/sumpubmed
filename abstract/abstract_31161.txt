BACKGROUND
citrus bacterial canker is a disease that has severe economic impact on citrus industries worldwide and is caused by a few species and pathotypes of xanthomonas. x. citri subsp. citri strain  <dig>  is a type a  strain with a wide host range, whereas its variant x. citri subsp. citri strain aw <dig>  is restricted to mexican lime.


RESULTS
to characterize the mechanism for the differences in host range of xcca and xcaw, the genome of xcaw <dig> that was completed recently was compared with xcca <dig> genome. effectors xopaf and avrgf <dig> are present in xcaw <dig>  but were absent in xcca <dig>  avrgf <dig> was shown previously for xcaw to cause hypersensitive response in duncan grapefruit. mutation analysis of xopaf indicates that the gene contributes to xcaw growth in mexican lime but does not contribute to the limited host range of xcaw. rna-seq analysis was conducted to compare the expression profiles of xcaw <dig> and xcca <dig> in nutrient broth  medium and xvm <dig> medium, which induces hrp gene expression. two hundred ninety two and  <dig> genes showed differential expression in xvm <dig> compared to in nb for xcca <dig> and xcaw <dig>  respectively. twenty-five type  <dig> secretion system genes were up-regulated in xvm <dig> for both xcca and xcaw. among the  <dig>  common genes of xcaw <dig> compared to xcca <dig>   <dig> genes in nb and  <dig> genes in xvm <dig> conditions were differentially regulated. xcaw <dig> showed higher protease activity than xcca <dig> whereas xcaw <dig> showed lower pectate lyase activity in comparison to xcca <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
comparative genomic analysis of xcca <dig> and xcaw <dig> identified strain specific genes. our study indicated that avrgf <dig> contributes to the host range limitation of xcaw <dig> whereas xopaf contributes to virulence. transcriptome analyses of xcca <dig> and xcaw <dig> presented insights into the expression of the two closely related strains of x. citri subsp. citri. virulence genes including genes encoding t3ss components and effectors are induced in xvm <dig> medium. numerous genes with differential expression in xcaw <dig> and xcca <dig> were identified. this study provided the foundation to further characterize the mechanisms for virulence and host range of pathotypes of x. citri subsp. citri.
