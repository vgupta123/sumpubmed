BACKGROUND
the brine shrimp artemia expresses four different types of haemoglobin subunits namely c <dig>  c <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  two of these four subunits dimerize in different combinations to produce the three isoforms of the heterodimeric artemia haemoglobin: hbi , hbii  and hbiii . previous biochemical, biophysical and computational analyses demonstrate that the t and c polymers are rings of nine concatenated globin domains, which are covalently joined by interdomain linkers. two such rings stacked coaxially give the functional molecule. this research aimed to construct a quaternary structural model of artemia hbii that shows the interpolymer interface and domain-domain alignment, using the ms3d  approach. this involved introducing chemical crosslinks between the two polymers, cleaving with trypsin and analyzing the resulting products by mass spectrometry. this was followed by computational analysis of the mass spectrometry data using the program searchxlinks to identify putatively crosslinked peptides.


RESULTS
six putative egs  crosslinked tryptic peptides were identified. all of them support a model in which the ef helices of all domains are in contact along the interpolymer surface, and domain  <dig> of the t-polymer aligns with domain  <dig> of the c-polymer. any two adjacent interpolymer domain pairs contact through the early helix h and early helix a. the orientation of domains is different from the subunit proposed model proposed previously by this group. crosslinking with gmbs  was also performed, and the results show good agreement with this model.


CONCLUSIONS
the interpolymer ef-contact allows the hydrophobic e and f helices to be buried in the interface and therefore allow the complex to solubilize readily to facilitate efficient oxygen transport. furthermore the ef-contact is a common contact in cooperative haemoglobins and thus the model is consistent with the cooperative behaviour of artemia hbii.
