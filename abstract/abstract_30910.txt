BACKGROUND
the leaves of globe artichoke and cultivated cardoon  have significant pharmaceutical properties, which mainly result from their high content of polyphenolic compounds such as monocaffeoylquinic and dicaffeoylquinic acid , and a range of flavonoid compounds.


RESULTS
hydroxycinnamoyl-coa:quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase  encoding genes have been isolated from both globe artichoke and cultivated cardoon  using codehop and pcr-race. a phylogenetic analysis revealed that their sequences belong to one of the major acyltransferase groups . the heterologous expression of globe artichoke hqt in e. coli showed that this enzyme can catalyze the esterification of quinic acid with caffeoyl-coa or p-coumaroyl-coa to generate, respectively, chlorogenic acid  and p-coumaroyl quinate. real time pcr experiments demonstrated an increase in the expression level of hqt in uv-c treated leaves, and established a correlation between the synthesis of phenolic acids and protection against damage due to abiotic stress. the hqt gene, together with a gene encoding hydroxycinnamoyl-coa:shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase  previously isolated from globe artichoke, have been incorporated within the developing globe artichoke linkage maps.


CONCLUSIONS
a novel acyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of cga in globe artichoke has been isolated, characterized and mapped. this is a good basis for our effort to understand the genetic basis of phenylpropanoid  biosynthesis in c. cardunculus.
