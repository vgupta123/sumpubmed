BACKGROUND
stochastic simulation of gene networks by markov processes has important applications in molecular biology. the complexity of exact simulation algorithms scales with the number of discrete jumps to be performed. approximate schemes reduce the computational time by reducing the number of simulated discrete events. also, answering important questions about the relation between network topology and intrinsic noise generation and propagation should be based on general mathematical results. these general results are difficult to obtain for exact models.


RESULTS
we propose a unified framework for hybrid simplifications of markov models of multiscale stochastic gene networks dynamics. we discuss several possible hybrid simplifications, and provide algorithms to obtain them from pure jump processes. in hybrid simplifications, some components are discrete and evolve by jumps, while other components are continuous. hybrid simplifications are obtained by partial kramers-moyal expansion  <cit>  which is equivalent to the application of the central limit theorem to a sub-model. by averaging and variable aggregation we drastically reduce simulation time and eliminate non-critical reactions. hybrid and averaged simplifications can be used for more effective simulation algorithms and for obtaining general design principles relating noise to topology and time scales. the simplified models reproduce with good accuracy the stochastic properties of the gene networks, including waiting times in intermittence phenomena, fluctuation amplitudes and stationary distributions. the methods are illustrated on several gene network examples.


CONCLUSIONS
hybrid simplifications can be used for onion-like  approaches to multi-scale biochemical systems, in which various descriptions are used at various scales. sets of discrete and continuous variables are treated with different methods and are coupled together in a physically justified approach.
