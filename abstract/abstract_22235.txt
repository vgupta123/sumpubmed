BACKGROUND
enterovirus  <dig>  and coxsackievirus a <dig>  are two major etiological agents of hand, foot and mouth disease . ev <dig> is associated with severe cases but not ca <dig>  the mechanisms contributed to the different pathogenesis of these two viruses are unknown. vp <dig> and vp <dig> are two major structural proteins of these viruses, and should be paid close attention to.


RESULTS
the sequences of vp1s from  <dig> ev <dig> and  <dig> ca <dig>  and vp4s from  <dig> ev <dig> and  <dig> ca <dig> isolated in this study during  <dig> to  <dig> hfmd seasons were analyzed together with the corresponding sequences available in genbank using dnastar and mega  <dig> . phylogenetic analysis of complete vp1s or vp4s showed that ev <dig> isolated in beijing belonged to c <dig> and ca <dig> belonged to lineage b <dig> . vp1s and vp4s from  <dig> strains of viruses expressed in e. coli bl <dig> cells were used to detect igm and igg in human sera by western blot. the detection of igm against vp1s of ev <dig> and ca <dig> showed consistent results with current infection, while none of the sera were positive against vp4s of ev <dig> and ca <dig>  there was significant difference in the positive rates between ev <dig> vp <dig> and ca <dig> vp <dig>  as well as ev <dig> vp <dig> and ca <dig> vp <dig>  in the detection of igg against recombinant proteins with same batch of serum samples. the sera-positive rate of igg against vp <dig> was higher than that against vp <dig> for both ev <dig>  and ca <dig> , which might be because of different positions of vp <dig> and vp <dig> in the capsid of the viruses.


CONCLUSIONS
ev <dig> and ca <dig> were highly diverse in the nucleotide sequences of vp1s and vp4s. the sera positive rates of vp <dig> and vp <dig> of ev <dig> were lower than those of ca <dig> respectively, which suggested a less exposure rate to ev <dig> than ca <dig> in beijing population. human serum antibodies detected by western blot using vp1s and vp4s as antigen indicated that the immunological reaction to vp <dig> and vp <dig> of both ev <dig> and ca <dig> was different.
