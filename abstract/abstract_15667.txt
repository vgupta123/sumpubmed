BACKGROUND
understanding syntentic relationship between two species is critical to assessing the potential for comparative genomic analysis. common bean  and soybean , the two most important members of the phaseoleae legumes, appear to have a diploid and polyploidy recent past, respectively. determining the syntentic relationship between these two species will allow researchers to leverage not only genomic resources but also genetic data for important agronomic traits to improve both of these species.


RESULTS
genetically-positioned transcript loci of common bean were mapped relative to the recent soybean  <dig>  pseudochromosome assembly. in nearly every case, each common bean locus mapped to two loci in soybean, a result consistent with the duplicate polyploidy history of soybean. blocks of synteny averaging  <dig> cm in common bean and  <dig>  mb in soybean were observed for all  <dig> common bean linkage groups, and these blocks mapped to all  <dig> soybean pseudochromosomes. the median physical-to-genetic distance ratio in common bean  was ~ <dig> kb/cm. ~ <dig>  common bean sequences  were electronically positioned onto the common bean map using the shared syntentic blocks as references points.


CONCLUSIONS
the collected evidence from this mapping strongly supports the duplicate history of soybean. it further provides evidence that the soybean genome was fractionated and reassembled at some point following the duplication event. these well mapped syntentic relationships between common bean and soybean will enable researchers to target specific genomic regions to discover genes or loci that affect phenotypic expression in both species.
