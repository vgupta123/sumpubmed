BACKGROUND
cell transplantation is likely to become an important therapeutic tool for the treatment of various traumatic and ischemic injuries to the central nervous system . however, in many pre-clinical cell therapy studies, reporter gene-assisted imaging of cellular implants in the cns and potential reporter gene and/or cell-based immunogenicity, still remain challenging research topics.


RESULTS
in this study, we performed cell implantation experiments in the cns of immunocompetent mice using autologous  luciferase-expressing bone marrow-derived stromal cells  cultured from rosa26-l-s-l-luciferase transgenic mice, and bmsc-luc genetically modified using a lentivirus encoding the enhanced green fluorescence protein  and the puromycin resistance gene  . both reporter gene-modified bmsc populations displayed high engraftment capacity in the cns of immunocompetent mice, despite potential immunogenicity of introduced reporter proteins, as demonstrated by real-time bioluminescence imaging  and histological analysis at different time-points post-implantation. in contrast, both bmsc-luc and bmsc-luc/egfp/pac did not survive upon intramuscular cell implantation, as demonstrated by real-time bli at different time-points post-implantation. in addition, elispot analysis demonstrated the induction of ifn-Î³-producing cd8+ t-cells upon intramuscular cell implantation, but not upon intracerebral cell implantation, indicating that bmsc-luc and bmsc-luc/egfp/pac are immune-tolerated in the cns. however, in our experimental transplantation model, results also indicated that reporter gene-specific immune-reactive t-cell responses were not the main contributors to the immunological rejection of bmsc-luc or bmsc-luc/egfp/pac upon intramuscular cell implantation.


CONCLUSIONS
we here demonstrate that reporter gene-modified bmsc derived from rosa26-l-s-l-luciferase transgenic mice are immune-tolerated upon implantation in the cns of syngeneic immunocompetent mice, providing a research model for studying survival and localisation of autologous bmsc implants in the cns by real-time bli and/or histological analysis in the absence of immunosuppressive therapy.
