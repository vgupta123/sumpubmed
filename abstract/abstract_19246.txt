BACKGROUND
hirudin is an anti-coagulation protein produced by the salivary glands of the medicinal leech hirudomedicinalis. it is a powerful and specific thrombin inhibitor. the novel recombinant hirudin, rgd-hirudin, which contains an rgd motif, competitively inhibits the binding of fibrinogen to gpiib/iiia on platelets, thus inhibiting platelet aggregation while maintaining its anticoagulant activity.


RESULTS
recombinant rgd-hirudin and six mutant variants , designed based on molecular simulations, were expressed in pichia pastoris. the proteins were refolded and purified to homogeneity as monomers by gel filtration and anion exchange chromatography. the anti-thrombin activity of the six mutants and rgd-hirudin was tested. further, we evaluated the binding of the mutant variants and rgd-hirudin to thrombin using biacore surface plasmon resonance analysis . kinetics and affinity constants showed that the kd values of all six mutant proteins were higher than that of rgd-hirudin.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings contribute to a novel understanding of the interaction between rgd-hirudin and thrombin.
