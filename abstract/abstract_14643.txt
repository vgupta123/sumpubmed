BACKGROUND
rumen microbes metabolize 22:6n- <dig>  however, pathways of 22:6n- <dig> biohydrogenation and ruminal microbes involved in this process are not known. in this study, we examine the ability of the well-known rumen biohydrogenating bacteria, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d <dig> and butyrivibrio proteoclasticus p <dig>  to hydrogenate 22:6n- <dig> 


RESULTS
butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d <dig> failed to hydrogenate 22:6n- <dig>  in growth medium containing autoclaved ruminal fluid that either had or had not been centrifuged. growth of b. fibrisolvens was delayed at the higher 22:6n- <dig> concentrations; however, total volatile fatty acid production was not affected. butyrivibrio proteoclasticus p <dig> hydrogenated 22:6n- <dig> in growth medium containing autoclaved ruminal fluid that either had or had not been centrifuged. biohydrogenation only started when volatile fatty acid production or growth of b. proteoclasticus p <dig> had been initiated, which might suggest that growth or metabolic activity is a prerequisite for the metabolism of 22:6n- <dig>  the amount of 22:6n- <dig> hydrogenated was quantitatively recovered in several intermediate products eluting on the gas chromatogram between 22:6n- <dig> and 22: <dig>  formation of neither 22: <dig> nor 22: <dig> conjugated fatty acids was observed during 22:6n- <dig> metabolism. extensive metabolism was observed at lower initial concentrations of 22:6n- <dig>  whereas increasing concentrations of 22:6n- <dig>  inhibited its metabolism. stearic acid formation  from 18:2n- <dig> by b. proteoclasticus p <dig> was retarded, but not completely inhibited, in the presence of 22:6n- <dig> and this effect was dependent on 22:6n- <dig> concentration.


CONCLUSIONS
for the first time, our study identified ruminal bacteria with the ability to hydrogenate 22:6n- <dig>  the gradual appearance of intermediates indicates that biohydrogenation of 22:6n- <dig> by b. proteoclasticus p <dig> occurs by pathways of isomerization and hydrogenation resulting in a variety of unsaturated  <dig> carbon fatty acids. during the simultaneous presence of 18:2n- <dig> and 22:6n- <dig>  b. proteoclasticus p <dig> initiated 22:6n- <dig> metabolism before converting 18: <dig> isomers into 18: <dig>
