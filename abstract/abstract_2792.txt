BACKGROUND
crispr-cas <dig> is a revolutionary genome editing technique that allows for efficient and directed alterations of the eukaryotic genome. this relatively new technology has already been used in a large number of ‘loss of function’ experiments in cultured cells. despite its simplicity and efficiency, screening for mutated clones remains time-consuming, laborious and/or expensive.


RESULTS
here we report a high-throughput screening strategy that allows parallel screening of up to  <dig> clones, using next-generation sequencing. as a proof of principle, we used crispr-cas <dig> to disrupt the coding sequence of the homeobox gene, evx <dig> in mouse embryonic stem cells. we screened  <dig> crispr-cas <dig> transfected clones simultaneously by next-generation sequencing on the ion torrent pgm. we were able to identify both homozygous and heterozygous evx <dig> mutants, as well as mixed clones, which must be identified to maintain the integrity of subsequent experiments.


CONCLUSIONS
our crispr-cas <dig> screening strategy could be widely applied to screen for crispr-cas <dig> mutants in a variety of contexts including the generation of mutant cell lines for in vitro research, the generation of transgenic organisms and for assessing the veracity of crispr-cas <dig> homology directed repair. this technique is cost and time-effective, provides information on clonal heterogeneity and is adaptable for use on various sequencing platforms.
