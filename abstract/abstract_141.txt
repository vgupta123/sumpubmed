BACKGROUND
mutations in three functionally diverse genes cause rett syndrome. although the functions of forkhead box g <dig> , methyl cpg binding protein  <dig>  and cyclin-dependent kinase-like  <dig>  have been studied individually, not much is known about their relation to each other with respect to expression levels and regulatory regions. here we analyzed data from hundreds of mouse and human samples included in the fantom <dig> project, to identify transcript initiation sites, expression levels, expression correlations and regulatory regions of the three genes.


RESULTS
our investigations reveal the predominantly used transcription start sites  for each gene including novel transcription start sites for foxg <dig>  we show that foxg <dig> expression is poorly correlated with the expression of mecp <dig> and cdkl <dig>  we identify promoter shapes for each tss, the predicted location of enhancers for each gene and the common transcription factors likely to regulate the three genes. our data imply polycomb repressive complex  <dig>  mediated silencing of foxg <dig> in cerebellum.


CONCLUSIONS
our analyses provide a comprehensive picture of the regulatory regions of the three genes involved in rett syndrome.
