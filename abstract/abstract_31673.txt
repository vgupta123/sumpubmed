BACKGROUND
the developments of high-throughput genotyping technologies, which enable the simultaneous genotyping of hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms  have the potential to increase the benefits of genetic epidemiology studies. although the enhanced resolution of these platforms increases the chance of interrogating functional snps that are themselves causative or in linkage disequilibrium with causal snps, commonly used single snp-association approaches suffer from serious multiple hypothesis testing problems and provide limited insights into combinations of loci that may contribute to complex diseases. drawing inspiration from gene set enrichment analysis developed for gene expression data, we have developed a method, named glossi , that integrates prior biological knowledge into the statistical analysis of genotyping data to test the association of a group of snps  with complex disease phenotypes. the most significant loci-sets can be used to formulate hypotheses from a functional viewpoint that can be validated experimentally.


RESULTS
in a simulation study, glossi showed sufficient power to detect loci-sets with less than 10% of snps having moderate-to-large effect sizes and intermediate minor allele frequency values. when applied to a biological dataset where no single snp-association was found in a previous study, glossi was able to identify several loci-sets that are significantly related to blood pressure response to an antihypertensive drug.


CONCLUSIONS
glossi is valuable for association of snps at multiple genetic loci with complex disease phenotypes. in contrast to methods based on the kolmogorov-smirnov statistic, the approach is parametric and only utilizes information from within the interrogated loci-set. it properly accounts for dependency among snps and allows the testing of loci-sets of any size.
