BACKGROUND
hyperleptinemia is known to participate in cardiac hypertrophy and hypertension, but the relationship between pressure overload and leptin is poorly understood. we therefore examined the expression of leptin  and the leptin receptor  in the pressure-overloaded rat heart. we also examined gene expressions in culture cardiac myocytes to clarify which hypertension-related stimulus induces these genes.


RESULTS
pressure overload was produced by ligation of the rat abdominal aorta, and ob and ob-r isoform mrnas were measured using a real-time polymerase chain reaction . we also measured these gene expressions in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes treated with angiotensin ii , endothelin- <dig> , or cyclic mechanical stretch. leptin and the long form of the leptin receptor  gene were significantly increased 4â€‰weeks after banding, but expression of the short form of the leptin receptor  was unchanged. ob-rb protein expression was also detected by immunohistochemistry in hypertrophied cardiac myocytes after banding. meanwhile, plasma leptin concentrations were not different between the control and banding groups. in cultured myocytes, angii and et- <dig> increased only ob mrna expression. however, mechanical stretch activated both ob and ob-rb mrna expression in a time-dependent manner, but ob-ra mrna was unchanged by any stress.


CONCLUSIONS
we first demonstrated that both pressure mediated hypertrophy and mechanical stretch up-regulate ob-rb gene expression in heart and cardiac myocytes, which are thought to be important for leptin action in cardiac myocytes. these results suggest a new local mechanism by which leptin affects cardiac remodeling in pressure-overloaded hearts.
