BACKGROUND
despite the broad diet range of many predatory ladybirds, the mechanisms involved in their adaptation to diet shifts are not completely understood. here, we explored how a primarily coccidophagous ladybird cryptolaemus montrouzieri adapts to feeding on aphids.


RESULTS
based on the lower survival rate, longer developmental time, and lower adult body weight and reproduction rate of the predator, the aphid megoura japonica proved being less suitable to support c. montrouzieri as compared with the citrus mealybug planococcus citri. the results indicated up-regulation of genes related to ribosome and translation in fourth instars, which may be related to their suboptimal development. also, several genes related to biochemical transport and metabolism, and detoxification were up-regulated as a result of adaptation to the changes in nutritional and non-nutritional  components of the prey.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicated that c. montrouzieri succeeded in feeding on aphids by regulation of genes related to development, digestion and detoxification. thus, we argue that these candidate genes are valuable for further studies of the functional evolution of ladybirds led by diet shifts.
