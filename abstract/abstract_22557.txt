BACKGROUND
few equations have been developed in veterinary medicine compared to human medicine to predict body composition. the present study was done to evaluate the influence of weight loss on biometry , bioimpedance analysis  and ultrasonography  in cats, proposing equations to estimate fat  and lean  body mass, as compared to dual energy x-ray absorptiometry  as the referenced method. for this were used  <dig> gonadectomized obese cats  in a weight loss program. dxa, bio, bia and us were performed in the obese state , after 10% of weight loss  and after 20% of weight loss . stepwise regression was used to analyze the relationship between the dependent variables  determined by dxa and the independent variables obtained by bio, bia and us. the better models chosen were evaluated by a simple regression analysis and means predicted vs. determined by dxa were compared to verify the accuracy of the equations.


RESULTS
the independent variables determined by bio, bia and us that best correlated  with the dependent variables  were bw , tc , pc , r  and sflt . using mallowsâ€™cp statistics, p value and r <dig>   <dig> equations were selected ; however, only  <dig> equations accurately predicted fm and one lm of cats.


CONCLUSIONS
the equations with two variables are better to use because they are effective and will be an alternative method to estimate body composition in the clinical routine. for estimated lean mass the equations using body weight associated with biometrics measures can be proposed. for estimated fat mass the equations using body weight associated with bioimpedance analysis can be proposed.
