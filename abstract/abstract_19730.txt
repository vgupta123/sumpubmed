BACKGROUND
mutations in the pten induced putative kinase  <dig>  are implicated in early-onset parkinson's disease. pink <dig> is expressed abundantly in mitochondria rich tissues, such as skeletal muscle, where it plays a critical role determining mitochondrial structural integrity in drosophila.


RESULTS
herein we characterize a novel splice variant of pink <dig>  that is homologous to the c-terminus regulatory domain of the protein kinase. naturally occurring non-coding antisense provides sophisticated mechanisms for diversifying genomes and we describe a human specific non-coding antisense expressed at the pink <dig> locus . we further demonstrate that pink <dig> varies in vivo when human skeletal muscle mitochondrial content is enhanced, supporting the idea that pink <dig> has a physiological role in mitochondrion. the observation of concordant regulation of svpink <dig> and napink <dig> during in vivo mitochondrial biogenesis was confirmed using rnai, where selective targeting of napink <dig> results in loss of the pink <dig> splice variant in neuronal cell lines.


CONCLUSIONS
our data presents the first direct observation that a mammalian non-coding antisense molecule can positively influence the abundance of a cis-transcribed mrna under physiological abundance conditions. while our analysis implies a possible human specific and dsrna-mediated mechanism for stabilizing the expression of svpink <dig>  it also points to a broader genomic strategy for regulating a human disease locus and increases the complexity through which alterations in the regulation of the pink <dig> locus could occur.
