BACKGROUND
although the responses to many pathogen associated molecular patterns  in cell cultures and extracted organs are well characterized, there is little known of transcriptome responses to pamps in whole organisms. to characterize this in detail, we have performed rnaseq analysis of responses of zebrafish embryos to injection of pamps in the caudal vein at one hour after exposure. we have compared two ligands that in mammals have been shown to specifically activate the tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> receptors: pam3csk <dig> and flagellin, respectively.


RESULTS
we identified a group of  <dig> common genes that respond with high stringency selection to stimulations with both pamps, which included several well-known immune marker genes such as il1b and tnfa. surprisingly, we also identified sets of  <dig> and  <dig> genes that specifically respond to either pam3csk <dig> or flagellin, respectively, after a comparative filtering approach. remarkably, in the pam3csk <dig> specific set, there was a set of transcription factors with more than  <dig> fold-change, as confirmed by qpcr analyses, including cebpb, fosb, nr4a <dig> and egr <dig>  we also showed that the regulation of the pam3csk <dig> and flagellin specifically responding sets is inhibited by knockdown of tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
our studies show that pam3csk <dig> and flagellin can stimulate the tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> signaling pathways leading to common and specific responses in the zebrafish embryo system.
