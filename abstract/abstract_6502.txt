BACKGROUND
uncoupling protein  <dig>  is a mitochondrial anion carrier, expressed in brown adipose tissue  of eutherians. ucp <dig> is responsible for uncoupling mitochondrial proton transport from the production of atp, thereby dissipating heat; it is essential for non-shivering thermogenesis  in mammalian bat. ucp <dig> orthologs have been identified in non-eutherian mammals, fish and amphibians. yet, ucp <dig> has a unique function in eutherians in that it is necessary in the production of heat . as such, this study aims to determine the evolutionary mode of ucp <dig> in eutherians, where there is clear evidence of ucp1-dependent nst in bat.


RESULTS
models of adaptive evolution through phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences by maximum likelihood were implemented to determine the mode of ucp <dig> protein evolution in eutherians. an increase in the rate of amino acid substitutions on the branch leading to eutherians is observed, but is best explained by relaxed constraints, not positive selection. further, evidence for branch and site heterogeneity in selection pressures, as well as divergent selection pressures between ucp <dig> and its paralogs  is observed.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that the unique thermogenic function of ucp <dig> in eutherians may be best explained by neutral processes. along with other evidence, this suggests that the primary biochemical properties of ucp <dig> may not differ between eutherians and non-eutherians.
