BACKGROUND
coupling of alternative splicing with nonsense-mediated mrna decay  may regulate gene expression. we report here the identification of a nonsense alternative transcript of the fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase  gene, which produces a protein despite the fact that it is subject to nmd.


RESULTS
during the characterization of the effects of the w262x nonsense mutation on fah mrna metabolism, two alternative transcripts  of the fah gene were identified. del <dig> lacks exon  <dig> and as a consequence, the reading frame is shifted and a premature termination codon appears at the 3'end of exon  <dig>  exons  <dig> and  <dig> are skipped in del <dig>  without any disruption of the reading frame. specific amplification of these transcripts demonstrate that they are produced through minor alternative splicing pathways, and that they are not caused by the w262x mutation per se. as shown with an antiserum raised against the c-terminal part of the putative del <dig> protein, the del <dig> transcript produces a protein, expressed at different levels in various human tissues. interestingly, the del <dig> transcript seems to be subjected to nonsense-mediated mrna decay, as its level was stabilized following a cycloheximide treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
the del <dig> and del <dig> transcripts arise due to minor alternative splicing pathways and del <dig> is likely subjected to nonsense-mediated mrna decay. however the remaining amount of transcript seems sufficient to produce a protein in different human tissues. this suggests that nmd has a broader role than simply eliminating aberrant transcripts and when coupled to alternative splicing, may act to modulate gene expression, by allowing the production of low amounts of protein.
