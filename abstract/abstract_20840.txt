BACKGROUND
feline leukaemia virus  is a pathogen causing fatal illness in cats worldwide, and as such there is a high demand for products to protect against disease. the duration of immunity provided by an inactivated felv vaccine, versifel felv, when administered to cats of the target age was determined. kittens received two vaccinations when aged  <dig> to  <dig> weeks old, and were subsequently challenged up to  <dig> months later with the felv-a glasgow isolate.


RESULTS
in all studies, all of the younger aged control kittens showed persistent felv p <dig> antigenaemia confirming that the challenge virus was severe and efficacious. in contrast, the control cats did not show the required level of persistent antigenaemia, with a maximum of 45% cats affected in the middle duration study and only 10% in the longer study. however, apart from one animal in the short duration study, all of the cats vaccinated with versifel felv were negative for persistent antigenaemia and can be considered treatment successes.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have shown that although age-related resistance to infection with a virulent felv challenge is evident from as early as  <dig> months of age, vaccination with versifel felv may aid in the protection of cats from felv related disease up to three years after primary vaccination as kittens.
