BACKGROUND
the regulation of lipid biosynthesis is essential in photosynthetic eukaryotic cells. this regulation occurs during the direct synthesis of fatty acids and triacylglycerols , as well as during other controlling processes in the main carbon metabolic pathway.


RESULTS
in this study, the mrna levels of chlamydomonas citrate synthase  were found to decrease under nitrogen-limited conditions, which suggests suppressed gene expression. gene silencing by rna interference  was conducted to determine whether crcis suppression affected the carbon flux in tag biosynthesis. results showed that the tag level increased by  <dig> %, whereas the crcis activities in the corresponding transgenic algae decreased by  <dig> % to  <dig> %. moreover, the decrease in crcis expression led to the increased expression of tag biosynthesis-related genes, such as acyl-coa:diacylglycerol acyltransferase and phosphatidate phosphatase. conversely, overexpression of crcis gene decreased the tag level by 45% but increased crcis activity by 209% to 266% in transgenic algae.


CONCLUSIONS
the regulation of crcis gene can indirectly control the lipid content of algal cells. our findings propose that increasing oil by suppressing crcis expression in microalgae is feasible.
