BACKGROUND
prostaglandin e <dig>  is involved in several chronic inflammatory diseases including periodontitis, which causes loss of the gingival tissue and alveolar bone supporting the teeth. we have previously shown that tumor necrosis factor α  induces pge <dig> synthesis in gingival fibroblasts. in this study we aimed to investigate the global gene expression profile of tnfα-stimulated primary human gingival fibroblasts, focusing on signal pathways related to the pge2-synthesizing enzymes prostaglandin e synthases , as well as the upstream enzyme cyclooxygenase- <dig>  and pge <dig> production.


RESULTS
microarray and western blot analyses showed that the mrna and protein expression of the inflammatory induced microsomal prostaglandin e synthase- <dig>  was up-regulated by the cytokine tnfα, accompanied by enhanced expression of cox- <dig> and increased production of pge <dig>  in contrast, the expression of the isoenzymes microsomal prostaglandin e synthase- <dig>  and cytosolic prostaglandin e synthase  was unaffected by tnfα treatment. using oligonucleotide microarray analysis in a time-course factorial design including time points  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h, differentially expressed genes in response to tnfα treatment were identified. enrichment analysis of microarray data indicated two positively regulated signal transduction pathways: c-jun n-terminal kinase  and nuclear factor-κb . to evaluate their involvement in the regulation of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> expression, we used specific inhibitors as well as phosphorylation analysis. phosphorylation analysis of jnk  and nf-κb p <dig>  showed increased phosphorylation in response to tnfα treatment, which was decreased by specific inhibitors of jnk  and nf-κb . inhibitors of jnk and nf-κb also decreased the tnfα-stimulated up-regulation of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> as well as pge <dig> production.


CONCLUSIONS
in the global gene expression profile, the enrichment analysis of microarray data identified the two signal transduction pathways jnk and nf-κb as positively regulated by the cytokine tnfα. inhibition of these tnfα-activated signal pathways reduced the expression of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> as well as their end product pge <dig> in gingival fibroblasts. the involvement of the signal pathways jnk and nf-κb in the regulation of pge <dig> induced by tnfα may suggest these two pathways as possible attractive targets in the chronic inflammatory disease periodontitis.
