BACKGROUND
the intimate relationship between dogs and their owners has the potential to increase the risk of human exposure to bacterial pathogens. over the past 40 years, there have been several reports on transmission of salmonellae from dogs to humans. this study therefore aimed to determine the prevalence of salmonella in the faeces of dogs from the midlands region of the united kingdom to assess exposure risk and potential for zoonotic transmission.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> apparently healthy dogs without diarrhoea from households , rescue centres , boarding kennels , retired greyhound kennels  and a pet nutrition facility  were investigated for salmonella shedding. faecal samples were processed by an enrichment culture based method. the faeces from one dog  was positive for salmonella. the species was s. enterica subspecies arizonae.


CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that the prevalence of salmonella from faeces from apparently healthy dogs from a variety of housing conditions is low; however, salmonella shedding was still identified.
