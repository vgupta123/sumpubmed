BACKGROUND
predicting the ability of rams to detect, mate and fertilise ewes in oestrus accurately is certainly difficult; however, tests based on clinical examinations have been performed to assess the overall potential capacity of rams to serve and impregnate ewes. clinical examinations for breeding soundness evaluation were carried out in  <dig> rasa aragonesa  rams from  <dig> flocks in north-eastern  spain. clinical examinations of head, trunk, limbs and genitals were performed in each ram. blood samples were collected for a serological study of brucella ovis. the sheep owners were surveyed regarding the characteristics of the flock, rams’ health history and the management of rams. the clinical alterations found were classified according to severity . rams were classified as suitable  or unsuitable  for breeding depending on the results of the clinical examinations.


RESULTS
the results showed that  <dig>  % of rams presented some type of alteration  in various body parts , and that  <dig>  % of rams were classified as unsuitable breeders. the most common genital alterations were ulcerative posthitis  followed by testicular lesions . the highest prevalence of unsuitable breeders was found in the category of adult and aged rams  and in the category of emaciated rams . all rams examined were seronegative to brucella ovis. the mean percentage of rams in flocks was  <dig>  % ; nevertheless, this percentage dropped to  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  when only suitable or effective  rams were considered.


CONCLUSIONS
thus, it is concluded that there are fewer effective rams in farms than farmers realise. frequent clinical examination of males is recommended in order to identify potentially infertile rams.
