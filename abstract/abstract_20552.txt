BACKGROUND
prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality among us men. epidemiological evidence suggests that high vitamin d status protects men from prostate cancer and the active form of vitamin d, 1Î±, <dig> dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> 2d) has anti-cancer effects in cultured prostate cells. still, the molecular mechanisms and the gene targets for vitamin d-mediated prostate cancer prevention are unknown.


RESULTS
we examined the effect of  <dig> d  on the transcript profile of proliferating rwpe <dig> cells, an immortalized, non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cell line that is growth arrested by  <dig> d . our analysis revealed many transcript level changes at a 5% false detection rate:  <dig> h,  <dig> ,  <dig> h,  <dig> ,  <dig> h,  <dig> .  <dig> transcripts were regulated similarly at all time points  and many of the promoters for these transcripts contained putative vitamin d response elements. functional analysis by pathway or gene set analysis revealed early suppression of wnt, notch, nf-kb, and igf <dig> signaling. transcripts related to inflammation were suppressed at  <dig> h  and suppression of proinflammatory pathways continued at later time points . there was also evidence for induction of anti-angiogenic pathways and induction of transcripts for protection from oxidative stress or maintenance of cell redox homeostasis at  <dig> h.


CONCLUSIONS
our data reveal of large number of potential new, direct vitamin d target genes relevant to prostate cancer prevention. in addition, our data suggests that rather than having a single strong regulatory effect, vitamin d orchestrates a pattern of changes within prostate epithelial cells that limit or slow carcinogenesis.
