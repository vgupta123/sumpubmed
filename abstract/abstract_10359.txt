BACKGROUND
myostatin, a member of the tgfÎ² superfamily, is well known as a potent and specific negative regulator of muscle growth. targeting the myostatin signalling pathway may offer promising therapeutic strategies for the treatment of muscle-wasting disorders. in the last decade, various myostatin-binding proteins have been identified to be able to inhibit myostatin activity. one of these is gasp <dig> , a protein containing a follistatin domain as well as multiple domains associated with protease inhibitors. despite in vitro data, remarkably little is known about in vivo functions of gasp <dig>  to further address the role of gasp <dig> during mouse development and in adulthood, we generated a gain-of-function transgenic mouse model that overexpresses gasp <dig> under transcriptional control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter/enhancer.


RESULTS
overexpression of gasp <dig> led to an increase in muscle mass observed not before day  <dig> of postnatal life. the surgasp <dig> transgenic mice did not display any other gross abnormality. histological and morphometric analysis of surgasp <dig> rectus femoris muscles revealed an increase in myofiber size without a corresponding increase in myofiber number. fiber-type distribution was unaltered. interestingly, we do not detect a change in total fat mass and lean mass. these results differ from those for myostatin knockout mice, transgenic mice overexpressing the myostatin propeptide or follistatin which exhibit both muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and show minimal fat deposition.


CONCLUSIONS
altogether, our data give new insight into the in vivo functions of gasp <dig>  as an extracellular regulatory factor in the myostatin signalling pathway, additional studies on gasp <dig> and its homolog gasp <dig> are required to elucidate the crosstalk between the different intrinsic inhibitors of the myostatin.
