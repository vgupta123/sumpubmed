BACKGROUND
self-renewing, chemoresistant breast cancer stem cells are believed to contribute significantly to cancer invasion, migration and patient relapse. therefore, the identification of signaling pathways that regulate the acquisition of stem-like qualities is an important step towards understanding why patients relapse and towards development of novel therapeutics that specifically target cancer stem cell vulnerabilities. recent studies identified a role for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor , an environmental carcinogen receptor implicated in cancer initiation, in normal tissue-specific stem cell self-renewal. these studies inspired the hypothesis that the ahr plays a role in the acquisition of cancer stem cell-like qualities.


RESULTS
to test this hypothesis, ahr activity in hs578t triple negative and sum <dig> inflammatory breast cancer cells were modulated with ahr ligands, shrna or ahr-specific inhibitors, and phenotypic, genomic and functional stem cell-associated characteristics were evaluated. the data demonstrate that  aldhhigh cells express elevated levels of ahr and cyp1b <dig> and cyp1a <dig>  ahr-driven genes,  ahr knockdown reduces aldh activity by 80 %,  ahr hyper-activation with several ligands, including environmental ligands, significantly increases aldh <dig> activity, expression of stem cell- and invasion/migration-associated genes, and accelerates cell migration,  a significant correlation between ahr or cyp1b <dig> expression  and expression of stem cell- and invasion/migration-associated gene sets is seen with genomic data obtained from  <dig> human breast cancer cell lines and over  <dig>  primary human breast cancers,  the ahr interacts directly with sox <dig>  a master regulator of self-renewal; ahr ligands increase this interaction and nuclear sox <dig> translocation,  ahr knockdown inhibits tumorsphere formation in low adherence conditions,  ahr inhibition blocks the rapid migration of aldhhigh cells and reduces aldhhigh cell chemoresistance,  aldhhigh cells are highly efficient at initiating tumors in orthotopic xenografts, and  ahr knockdown inhibits tumor initiation and reduces tumor aldh1a <dig>  sox <dig>  and cyp1b <dig> expression in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that the ahr plays an important role in development of cells with cancer stem cell-like qualities and that environmental ahr ligands may exacerbate breast cancer by enhancing expression of these properties.
