BACKGROUND
non-small cell lung cancer  is a major cause of cancer-related death worldwide due to poor patient prognosis and clinical outcome. here, we studied the genetic variations underlying nsclc pathogenesis based on their association to patient outcome after gemcitabine therapy.


RESULTS
bioinformatics analysis was used to investigate possible effects of pola <dig> g583r  in terms of protein function. using biostatistics, pola2+ <dig> gg/ga  was identified as strongly associated with mortality rate and survival time among nsclc patients. it was also shown that pola2+ <dig> gg/ga is functionally significant for protein localization via green fluorescent protein -tagging and confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis. the single nucleotide polymorphism  causes dna polymerase alpha subunit b to localize in the cytoplasm instead of the nucleus. this inhibits dna replication in cancer cells and confers a protective effect in individuals with this snp.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that pola2+ <dig> gg/ga may be used as a prognostic biomarker of patient outcome in nsclc pathogenesis.
