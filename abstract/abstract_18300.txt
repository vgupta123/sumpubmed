BACKGROUND
filamentous fungi are potent biomass degraders due to their ability to thrive in lignocellulose-rich environments. during the last decade, fungal genome sequencing initiatives have yielded abundant information on the genes that are putatively involved in lignocellulose degradation. at present, additional experimental studies are essential to provide insights into the fungal secreted enzymatic pools involved in lignocellulose degradation.


RESULTS
in this study, we performed a wide analysis of  <dig> filamentous fungi for which genomic data are available to investigate their biomass-hydrolysis potential. a comparison of fungal genomes and secretomes using enzyme activity profiling revealed discrepancies in carbohydrate active enzymes  sets dedicated to plant cell wall. investigation of the contribution made by each secretome to the saccharification of wheat straw demonstrated that most of them individually supplemented the industrial trichoderma reesei cl <dig> enzymatic cocktail. unexpectedly, the most striking effect was obtained with the phytopathogen ustilago maydis that improved the release of total sugars by 57% and of glucose by 22%. proteomic analyses of the best-performing secretomes indicated a specific enzymatic mechanism of u. maydis that is likely to involve oxido-reductases and hemicellulases.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides insight into the lignocellulose-degradation mechanisms by filamentous fungi and allows for the identification of a number of enzymes that are potentially useful to further improve the industrial lignocellulose bioconversion process.
