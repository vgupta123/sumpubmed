BACKGROUND
bovine chromosome   <dig> contains a quantitative trait loci  for meat tenderness, as well as several breaks in synteny with human chromosome   <dig>  both linkage and radiation hybrid  maps of bta  <dig> are available, but the linkage map lacks gene-specific markers needed to identify genes underlying the qtl, and the gene-rich rh map lacks associations with marker genotypes needed to define the qtl. integrating the maps will provide information to further explore the qtl as well as refine the comparative map between bta  <dig> and hsa  <dig>  a recently developed approach to integrating linkage and rh maps uses both linkage and rh data to resolve a consensus marker order, rather than aligning independently constructed maps. automated map construction procedures employing this maximum-likelihood approach were developed to integrate bta rh and linkage data, and establish comparative positions of bta  <dig> markers with hsa  <dig> homologs.


RESULTS
the integrated bta  <dig> map represents  <dig> markers;  <dig> shared by both data sets,  <dig> unique to the linkage data and  <dig> unique to rh data. sequence alignment yielded comparative positions for  <dig> bovine markers with homologs on hsa  <dig>  the map covers approximately 32% of hsa  <dig> sequence in five segments of conserved synteny, another 15% of hsa  <dig> is shared with bta  <dig>  bovine and human order are consistent in portions of the syntenic segments, but some rearrangement is apparent. comparative positions of gene markers near the meat tenderness qtl indicate the region includes separate segments of hsa  <dig>  the two microsatellite markers flanking the qtl peak are between defined syntenic segments.


CONCLUSIONS
combining data to construct an integrated map not only consolidates information from different sources onto a single map, but information contributed from each data set increases the accuracy of the map. comparison of bovine maps with well annotated human sequence can provide useful information about genes near mapped bovine markers, but bovine gene order may be different than human. procedures to connect genetic and physical mapping data, build integrated maps for livestock species, and connect those maps to more fully annotated sequence can be automated, facilitating the maintenance of up-to-date maps, and providing a valuable tool to further explore genetic variation in livestock.
