BACKGROUND
the interleukin- <dig> chemokine  g-protein coupled receptor cxcr <dig> governs pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic responses in leukocytes and endothelial cells. at a molecular standpoint, cxcr <dig> is widely reported to operate through calcium flux, phosphoinoisitide  <dig> kinase  and mitogen-activated protein kinase . while cxcr <dig> trafficking is suspected to be intertwined with its signaling, the exact mechanism is not fully elucidated.


RESULTS
here, we identified the lysine  <dig> within the cxcr <dig> c-terminal tail as a key residue for ubiquitination, internalization, and signaling. first, the substitution to an arginine of k <dig> mutation was associated with a reduction in cxcr <dig> poly-ubiquitination. while wt cxcr <dig> was rapidly internalized following il- <dig> administration, k327r mutant remained at the plasma membrane. finally, k327r mutant failed to promote the recruitment of β-arrestin <dig>  as estimated by imagery and bioluminescence resonance transfer. as a consequence, the activation of intracellular signaling, including both early events such as erk phosphorylation and the increase in calcium flux, and the latter activation of the ap <dig> and nf-κb transcription factors, was blunted.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, our results demonstrate that cxcr <dig> ubiquitination on k <dig> residue modulates agonist-activated cxcr <dig> cell sorting and intracellular signaling. thus, the inhibition of k <dig> ubiquitination might emerge as an effective mean to curb exacerbated cxcr <dig> signaling in several pathological conditions, such as inflammatory diseases and cancer.
