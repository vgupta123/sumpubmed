BACKGROUND
to investigate antibiotic resistance, the occurrence and distribution of class  <dig> and  <dig> integrons in multidrug- resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates from hospitals in tehran, iran.

the isolates were examined for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. the meca gene, class  <dig> and  <dig> integrons were detected by pcr. integrase positive strains were further analysed for the presence of resistance gene cassettes using specific primers and were sequenced.


RESULTS
among 139 s.aureus isolates,  <dig>  and  <dig>  strains were considered as multidrug resistant and meca positive, respectively. class  <dig> integrons and internal variable regions were found in  <dig>  %  and 97 %  and class  <dig> integrons and variable regions also in  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  of s.aureus clinical isolates, respectively. twelve distinct cassette arrays were found, containing genes encoding resistance to β-lactams, aminoglycosides, streptothricin, trimethoprim, chloramphenicol,a putative glucose dehydrogenase precursor and a protein with unknown function. gene cassette arrays aadb, aada <dig> and dhfra1-sat2-aada <dig> were common in s.aureus isolates. we detected a completely new gene cassettes which contained aadb, oxa <dig>  aaca <dig>  orfd-aaca4-catb <dig>  aadb-catb <dig>  orfd-aaca <dig> and aadb-aada1-cmla <dig> of class  <dig> and dhfra1-sat2-aada <dig>  dhfra <dig>  dhfra1-sat <dig> of class  <dig> integrons.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study to report carriage of class  <dig> and  <dig> integrons and associated gene cassettes among in s.aureus isolates from iran.
