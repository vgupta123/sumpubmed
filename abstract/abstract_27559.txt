BACKGROUND
pre-harvest infection of peanuts by aspergillus flavus and subsequent aflatoxin contamination is one of the food safety factors that most severely impair peanut productivity and human and animal health, especially in arid and semi-arid tropical areas. some peanut cultivars with natural pre-harvest resistance to aflatoxin contamination have been identified through field screening. however, little is known about the resistance mechanism, which has slowed the incorporation of resistance into cultivars with commercially acceptable genetic background. therefore, it is necessary to identify resistance-associated proteins, and then to recognize candidate resistance genes potentially underlying the resistance mechanism.


RESULTS
the objective of this study was to identify resistance-associated proteins in response to a. flavus infection under drought stress using two-dimensional electrophoresis with mass spectrometry. to identify proteins involved in the resistance to pre-harvest aflatoxin contamination, we compared the differential expression profiles of seed proteins between a resistant cultivar  and a susceptible cultivar  under well-watered condition, drought stress, and a. flavus infection with drought stress. a total of  <dig> spots showed differential expression between resistant and susceptible cultivars in response to a. flavus attack under drought stress. among these spots,  <dig> protein spots that consistently exhibited an altered expression were screened by image master  <dig>  software and successfully identified by maldi-tof ms. five protein spots, including oso7g <dig>  pii protein, cdk <dig>  oxalate oxidase, sap domain-containing protein, were uniquely expressed in the resistant cultivar. six protein spots including low molecular weight heat shock protein precursor, rio kinase, l-ascorbate peroxidase, iso-ara h <dig>   <dig> s ribosomal protein l <dig> and putative  <dig> s ribosomal s <dig> were significantly up-regulated in the resistant cultivar challenged by a. flavus under drought stress. a significant decrease or down regulation of trypsin inhibitor caused by a. flavus in the resistant cultivar was also observed. in addition, variations in protein expression patterns for resistant and susceptible cultivars were further validated by real time rt-pcr analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study provides new insights into understanding of the molecular mechanism of resistance to pre-harvest aflatoxin contamination in peanut, and will help to develop peanut varieties with resistance to pre-harvested aflatoxin contamination.
