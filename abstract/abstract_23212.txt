BACKGROUND
the syrian hamster, mesocricetus auratus, has distinct immunological features and is uniquely susceptible to intracellular pathogens. studies in hamsters are limited by the relative unavailability of tools to conduct immunological studies. to address this limitation we developed duplex real-time reverse transcriptase  pcr assays for the relative quantification of the mrnas of hamster cytokines, chemokines, and related immune response molecules.


RESULTS
real-time rt-pcr primers and probes were synthesized for analysis of interleukin - <dig>  ifn-γ, tnf-α, il- <dig>  il-12p <dig>  tgf-β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  chemokine ligand   <dig>  ccl <dig>  chemokine  receptor  <dig> and foxp <dig> expression. standard curves and validation experiments were performed for each real-time rt-pcr assay, allowing us to use the comparative ct  method to calculate changes in gene expression. application of the real-time rt pcr assays to a biological model was demonstrated by comparing mrna expression in skin and lymph node tissues between uninfected and leishmania panamensis infected hamsters.


CONCLUSIONS
the duplex real-time rt pcr assays provide a powerful approach for the quantification of cytokine transcription in hamsters, and their application to a model of cutaneous leishmaniasis suggests that a balanced type  <dig> and type  <dig> cytokine response contributes to the chronic, nonprogressive course of disease. these new molecular tools will further facilitate investigation into the mechanisms of disease in the hamster, not only for models of leishmaniasis, but also for other viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections.
