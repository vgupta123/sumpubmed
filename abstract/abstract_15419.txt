BACKGROUND
lumpy skin disease virus  is a capripoxvirus infecting cattle and buffalos. lumpy skin disease  leads to significant economic losses due to hide damage, reduction of milk production, mastitis, infertility and mortalities . early detection of the virus is crucial to start appropriate outbreak control measures. veterinarians rely on the presence of the characteristic clinical signs of lsd. laboratory diagnostics including virus isolation, sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction  are performed at well-equipped laboratories. in this study, a portable, simple, and rapid recombinase polymerase amplification  assay for the detection of lsdv-genome for the use on farms was developed.


RESULTS
the lsdv rpa assay was performed at  <dig> °c and detected down to  <dig> dna copies/reaction in a maximum of  <dig> min. unspecific amplification was observed with neither lsdv-negative samples  nor nucleic acid preparations from orf virus, bovine papular stomatitis virus, cowpoxvirus, peste des petits ruminants and blue tongue virus . the clinical sensitivity of the lsdv rpa assay matched  <dig> %  to real-time pcr results. in addition, the lsdv rpa assay detected sheep and goat poxviruses.


CONCLUSIONS
the lsdv rpa assay is a rapid and sensitive test that could be implemented in field or at quarantine stations for the identification of lsdv infected case.
