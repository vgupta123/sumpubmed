BACKGROUND
penicillin g acylase  is used industrially to catalyze the hydrolysis of penicillin g to obtain 6-aminopenicillanic acid. in escherichia coli, the most-studied microorganism for pga production, this enzyme accumulates in the periplasmic cell space, and temperature plays an important role in the correct synthesis of its subunits.


RESULTS
this work investigates the influence of medium composition, cultivation strategy, and temperature on pga production by recombinant e. coli cells. shake flask cultures carried out using induction temperatures ranging from  <dig> to 28°c revealed that the specific enzyme activity achieved at 20°c  was 6-fold higher than the value obtained at 28°c. auto-induction and high cell density fed-batch bioreactor cultures were performed using the selected induction temperature, with both defined and complex media, and iptg and lactose as inducers. final biomass concentrations of  <dig> and  <dig> gdcw l- <dig>  and maximum enzyme productivities of  <dig> and 5556 iu l-1 h- <dig>  were achieved for high cell density cultures using complex and defined media, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge, the volumetric enzyme activity and productivity values achieved using the complex medium are the highest ever reported for pga production using e. coli. overall pga recovery yields of  <dig> and 72% after purification were achieved for crude extracts obtained from cells cultivated in defined and complex media, respectively. the complex medium was the most cost-effective for pga production, and could be used in both high cell density and straightforward auto-induction protocols.
