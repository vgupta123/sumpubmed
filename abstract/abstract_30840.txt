BACKGROUND
leptospirosis is an important reemerging zoonosis, with more than half a million cases reported annually, and is caused by pathogenic leptospira species. development of a universal vaccine is one of the major strategic goals to overcome the disease burden of leptospirosis. in this study, a chimeric multi-epitope protein-based vaccine was designed and tested for its potency to induce a specific immune response and provide protection against l. interrogans infection.


RESULTS
the protein, containing four repeats of six t- and b-cell combined epitopes from the leptospiral outer membrane proteins, ompl <dig>  lipl <dig> and lipl <dig>  was expressed and purified. western blot analysis showed that the recombinant protein  mainly expressed in a soluble pattern, and reacted with antibodies raised in rabbit against heat-killed leptospira and in guinea pigs against the r4r vaccine. microscopic agglutination tests showed that r4r antisera was immunological cross-reactive with a range of chinese standard reference strains of leptospira belonging to different serogroups. in guinea pigs, the r4r vaccine induced a th1-biased immune response, as reflected by the igg2a/igg <dig> ratio and cytokine production of stimulated splenocytes derived from immunized animals. finally, r4r-immunized guinea pigs showed increased survival of lethal leptospira challenges compared with pbs-immunized animals and tissue damage and leptospiral colonization of the kidney were reduced.


CONCLUSIONS
the multi-epitope chimeric r4r protein is a promising antigen for the development of a universal cross-reactive vaccine against leptospirosis.
