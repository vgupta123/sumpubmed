BACKGROUND
the blood brain barrier  is the first line of defence of the central nervous system  against circulating pathogens, such as hiv. the cytotoxic hiv protein, gp <dig>  damages endothelial cells of the bbb, thereby compromising its integrity, which may lead to migration of hiv-infected cells into the brain. fibroblast growth factor  <dig> , produced primarily by astrocytes, promotes endothelial cell fitness and angiogenesis. we hypothesized that treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells  with fgf <dig> would protect the cells from gp120-mediated toxicity via endothelial cell survival signalling.


RESULTS
exposure of huvec to gp <dig> resulted in dose- and time-dependent cell death; whereas, pre-treatment of endothelial cells with fgf <dig> protected cells from gp <dig> angiotoxicity. treatment of huvec with fgf <dig> resulted in dose- and time-dependent activation of the extracellular regulated kinase , with moderate effects on phosphoinositol  <dig> kinase  and protein kinase b , also known as akt, but no effects on glycogen synthase kinase  <dig>  activity. using pharmacological approaches, gene transfer and kinase activity assays, we show that fgf2-mediated angioprotection against gp <dig> toxicity is regulated by crosstalk among the erk, pi3k-akt and pkc signalling pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these results suggest that fgf <dig> may play a significant role in maintaining the integrity of the bbb during the progress of hiv associated cerebral endothelial cell damage.
