BACKGROUND
high throughput microarray analyses result in many differentially expressed genes that are potentially responsible for the biological process of interest. in order to identify biological similarities between genes, publications from medline were identified in which pairs of gene names and combinations of gene name with specific keywords were co-mentioned.


RESULTS
medline search strings for  <dig>  known genes and  <dig>  keywords were generated and validated. pubmed ids were retrieved from medline and relative probability of co-occurrences of all gene-gene and gene-keyword pairs determined. to assess gene clustering according to literature co-publication,  <dig> genes consisting of  <dig> sets with known connections  were run through the program. receiver operator characteristics  analyses showed that most gene sets were clustered much better than expected by random chance. to test grouping of genes from real microarray data,  <dig> differentially expressed genes from a microarray experiment were analyzed with copub mapper, which resulted in several relevant clusters of genes with biological process and disease keywords. in addition, all genes versus keywords were hierarchical clustered to reveal a complete grouping of published genes based on co-occurrence.


CONCLUSIONS
the copub mapper program allows for quick and versatile querying of co-published genes and keywords and can be successfully used to cluster predefined groups of genes and microarray data.
