BACKGROUND
progressive remodeling of the left ventricle  following myocardial infarction  can lead to congestive heart failure, but the underlying initiation factors remain poorly defined. the objective of this study, accordingly, was to determine the key factors and elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of lv remodeling using integrated computational and experimental approaches.


RESULTS
by examining the extracellular matrix  gene expression and plasma analyte levels in c57/bl6j mice lv post-mi and ecm gene responses to transforming growth factor  in cultured cardiac fibroblasts, we found that key factors in lv remodeling included macrophages, fibroblasts, transforming growth factor-β <dig>  matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> , and specific collagen subtypes. we established a mathematical model to study lv remodeling post-mi by quantifying the dynamic balance between ecm construction and destruction. the mathematical model incorporated the key factors and demonstrated that tgf-β <dig> stimuli and mmp- <dig> interventions with different strengths and intervention times lead to different lv remodeling outcomes. the predictions of the mathematical model fell within the range of experimental measurements for these interventions, providing validation for the model.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results demonstrated that the balance between ecm synthesis and degradation, controlled by interactions of specific key factors, determines the lv remodeling outcomes. our mathematical model, based on the balance between ecm construction and destruction, provides a useful tool for studying the regulatory mechanisms and for predicting lv remodeling outcomes.
