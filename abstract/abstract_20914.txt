BACKGROUND
we have previously sequenced more than  <dig> kb of the duplicated mhc class i regions in atlantic salmon. in the ia region we identified the loci for the mhc class i gene sasa-uba in addition to a soluble mhc class i molecule, sasa-ula. a pseudolocus for sasa-uca was identified in the nonclassical ib region. both regions contained genes for antigen presentation, as wells as orthologues to other genes residing in the human mhc region.


RESULTS
the genomic localisation of two mhc class i lineages  has been resolved.  <dig> bacs were sequenced using a combination of standard sanger and  <dig> sequencing. the new sequence data extended the ia region with  <dig> kb identifying the location of one z-lineage locus, zaa. the ib region was extended with  <dig> kb including three new z-lineage loci, zba, zca and zda in addition to a uga locus. an allelic version of the ib region contained a functional uda locus in addition to the uca pseudolocus. additionally a bac harbouring two mhc class i genes  was placed on linkage group  <dig>  while a bac containing the s-lineage locus saa  was placed on lg <dig>  gene expression studies showed limited expression range for all class i genes with exception of uba being dominantly expressed in gut, spleen and gills, and zaa with high expression in blood.


CONCLUSIONS
here we describe the genomic organization of mhc class i loci from the u-, z-, and s-lineages in atlantic salmon. nine of the described class i genes are located in the extension of the duplicated ia and ib regions, while three class i genes are found on two separate linkage groups. the gene organization of the two regions indicates that the ib region is evolving at a different pace than the ia region. expression profiling, polymorphic content, peptide binding properties and phylogenetic relationship show that atlantic salmon has only one mhc class ia gene , in addition to a multitude of nonclassical mhc class i genes from the u-, s- and z-lineages.
