BACKGROUND
cc chemokine receptor  <dig> , the major chemokine receptor expressed on eosinophils, binds promiscuously to several ligands including eotaxins  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  even though the only cells that consistently accumulate following eotaxin administration in vivo are myeloid cells , other cell types have recently been shown to express ccr <dig>  it is therefore important to elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating receptor expression.


RESULTS
in order to define regions responsible for ccr <dig> transcription, a dnase hypersensitive site was identified in the vicinity of exon  <dig>  coupled with our previous data implicating exon  <dig> in ccr <dig> transcription, we hypothesized that transcription factors bind to exon- <dig>  electrophoretic mobility shift analysis revealed that nuclear proteins in eosinophilic cells bound to exon  <dig>  furthermore, antibody interference and mutation studies demonstrated gata- <dig> binding to exon  <dig>  in order to test the  <dig> -kb ccr <dig> promoter element  for in vivo function, this region was used to generate transgenic mice that expressed a reporter protein. strong transgene expression was achieved, with the pattern of expression suggesting a broad acting promoter.


CONCLUSIONS
the transcription factor gata- <dig> binds to ccr <dig> exon  <dig>  the  <dig> -kb ccr <dig> promoter element, that includes exon  <dig>  is a strong promoter in vivo.
