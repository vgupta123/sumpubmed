BACKGROUND
urinary tract infections  are among the most common and costly infections in both hospitalized and ambulatory patients. uropathogenic e. coli  represent the majority of uti isolates and are a diverse group of bacteria that utilize a variety of virulence factors to establish infection of the genitourinary tract. the virulence factor cytotoxic necrotizing factor- <dig>  is frequently expressed in clinical upec isolates. to date, there have been conflicting reports on the role of cnf <dig> in the pathogenesis of e. coli urinary tract infections.


RESULTS
we examined the importance of cnf <dig> in a murine ascending kidney infection/ pyelonephritis model by performing comparative studies between a clinical upec isolate strain and a cnf1-deletion mutant. we found no alterations in bacterial burden with the loss of cnf <dig>  whereas loss of the virulence factor fimh decreased bacterial burdens. in addition, we found no evidence that cnf <dig> contributed to the recruitment of inflammatory infiltrates in the kidney or bladder in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
while further examination of cnf- <dig> may reveal a role in uti pathogenesis, our data casts doubt on the role of cnf- <dig> in the pathogenesis of upec uti. as with other infections, different models and approaches are needed to elucidate the contribution of cnf <dig> to e. coli uti.
