BACKGROUND
within the arabidopsis genome, there are  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase  genes. however, the biological functions of the majority of these p450s remain unknown. the cyp709b family of p450s includes three gene members, cyp709b <dig>  cyp709b <dig> and cyp709b <dig>  which have high amino acid sequence similarity and lack reports elucidating biological functions.


RESULTS
we identified t-dna insertion-based null mutants of the cyp709b subfamily of genes. no obvious morphological phenotypes were exhibited under normal growth conditions. when the responses to aba and salt stress were studied in these mutants, only the cyp709b <dig> mutant showed sensitivity to aba and salt during germination. under moderate salt treatment , cyp709b <dig> showed a higher percentage of damaged seedlings, indicating a lower tolerance to salt stress. cyp709b <dig> was highly expressed in all analyzed tissues and especially high in seedlings and leaves. in contrast, cyp709b <dig> and cyp709b <dig> were highly expressed in siliques, but were at very low levels in other tissues. under salt stress condition, cyp709b <dig> gene expression was induced after 24Â hr and remained at high expression level. expression of the wild type cyp709b <dig> gene in the cyp709b <dig> mutant fully complemented the salt intolerant phenotype. furthermore, metabolite profiling analysis revealed some differences between wild type and cyp709b <dig> mutant plants, supporting the salt intolerance phenotype of the cyp709b <dig> mutant.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that cyp709b <dig> plays a role in aba and salt stress response and provides evidence to support the functions of cytochrome p <dig> enzymes in plant stress response.
