BACKGROUND
mocapy++ is a toolkit for parameter learning and inference in dynamic bayesian networks . it supports a wide range of dbn architectures and probability distributions, including distributions from directional statistics .


RESULTS
the program package is freely available under the gnu general public licence  from sourceforge http://sourceforge.net/projects/mocapy. the package contains the source for building the mocapy++ library, several usage examples and the user manual.


CONCLUSIONS
mocapy++ is especially suitable for constructing probabilistic models of biomolecular structure, due to its support for directional statistics. in particular, it supports the kent distribution on the sphere and the bivariate von mises distribution on the torus. these distributions have proven useful to formulate probabilistic models of protein and rna structure in atomic detail.
