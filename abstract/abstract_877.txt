BACKGROUND
the homeobox genes are a large and diverse group of genes, many of which play important roles in the embryonic development of animals. increasingly, homeobox genes are being compared between genomes in an attempt to understand the evolution of animal development. despite their importance, the full diversity of human homeobox genes has not previously been described.


RESULTS
we have identified all homeobox genes and pseudogenes in the euchromatic regions of the human genome, finding many unannotated, incorrectly annotated, unnamed, misnamed or misclassified genes and pseudogenes. we describe  <dig> human homeobox loci, which we divide into  <dig> probable functional genes and  <dig> probable pseudogenes. these totals include  <dig> genes with partial homeoboxes and  <dig> pseudogenes that lack homeoboxes but are clearly derived from homeobox genes. these figures exclude the repetitive dux <dig> to dux <dig> homeobox sequences of which we identified  <dig> probable pseudogenes, with many more expected in heterochromatic regions. nomenclature is established for approximately  <dig> formerly unnamed loci, reflecting their evolutionary relationships to other loci in human and other species, and nomenclature revisions are proposed for around  <dig> other loci. we use a classification that recognizes  <dig> homeobox gene 'classes' subdivided into  <dig> homeobox gene 'families'.


CONCLUSIONS
we have conducted a comprehensive survey of homeobox genes and pseudogenes in the human genome, described many new loci, and revised the classification and nomenclature of homeobox genes. the classification scheme may be widely applicable to homeobox genes in other animal genomes and will facilitate comparative genomics of this important gene superclass.
