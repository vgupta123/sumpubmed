BACKGROUND
triple-negative breast cancer  is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis. clinically, tnbc patients have limited treatment options besides chemotherapy. the goal of this study was to determine the kinase dependency in tnbc cell lines and to predict compounds that could inhibit these kinases using integrative bioinformatics analysis.


RESULTS
we integrated publicly available gene expression data, high-throughput pharmacological profiling data, and quantitative in vitro kinase binding data to determine the kinase dependency in  <dig> tnbc cell lines. we employed kinase addiction ranker , a novel bioinformatics approach, which integrated these data sources to dissect kinase dependency in tnbc cell lines. we then used the kinase dependency predicted by kar for each tnbc cell line to query k-map for compounds targeting these kinases. wevalidated our predictions using published and new experimental data.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we implemented an integrative bioinformatics analysis that determines kinase dependency in tnbc. our analysis revealed candidate kinases as potential targets in tnbc for further pharmacological and biological studies.
