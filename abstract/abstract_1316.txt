BACKGROUND
the lavender phenotype in quail is a dilution of both eumelanin and phaeomelanin in feathers that produces a blue-grey colour on a wild-type feather pattern background. it has been previously demonstrated by intergeneric hybridization that the lavender mutation in quail is homologous to the same phenotype in chicken, which is caused by a single base-pair change in exon  <dig> of mlph.


RESULTS
in this study, we have shown that a mutation of mlph is also associated with feather colour dilution in quail, but that the mutational event is extremely different. in this species, the lavender phenotype is associated with a non-lethal complex mutation involving three consecutive overlapping chromosomal changes  that have consequences on the genomic organization of four genes . the deletion of prlh has no effect on the level of circulating prolactin. lavender birds have lighter body weight, lower body temperature and increased feed consumption and residual feed intake than wild-type plumage quail, indicating that this complex mutation is affecting the metabolism and the regulation of homeothermy.


CONCLUSIONS
an extensive overlapping chromosome rearrangement was associated with a non-pathological mendelian trait and minor, non deleterious effects in the lavender japanese quail which is a natural knockout for prlh.
