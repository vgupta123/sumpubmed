BACKGROUND
mitochondria are dynamic organelles that move along actin filaments, and serve as calcium stores in plant cells. the positioning and dynamics of mitochondria depend on membrane-cytoskeleton interactions, but it is not clear whether microfilament cytoskeleton has a direct effect on mitochondrial function and ca2+ storage. therefore, we designed a series of experiments to clarify the effects of actin filaments on mitochondrial ca2+ storage, cytoplasmic ca2+ concentration , and the interaction between mitochondrial ca2+ and cytoplasmic ca2+ in arabidopsis root hairs.


RESULTS
in this study, we found that treatments with latrunculin b  and jasplakinolide , which depolymerize and polymerize actin filaments respectively, decreased membrane potential and ca2+ stores in the mitochondria of arabidopsis root hairs. simultaneously, these treatments induced an instantaneous increase of cytoplasmic ca2+, followed by a continuous decrease. all of these effects were inhibited by pretreatment with cyclosporin a , a representative blocker of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore . moreover, we found there was a ca2+ concentration gradient in mitochondria from the tip to the base of the root hair, and this gradient could be disrupted by actin-acting drugs.


CONCLUSIONS
based on these results, we concluded that the disruption of actin filaments caused by lat-b or jas promoted irreversible opening of the mptp, resulting in mitochondrial ca2+ release into the cytoplasm, and consequent changes in c. we suggest that normal polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments are essential for mitochondrial ca2+ storage in root hairs.
