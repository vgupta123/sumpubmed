BACKGROUND
in plant breeding, there are two primary applications for dna markers in selection: 1) selection of known genes using a single marker assay ; and 2) whole-genome profiling and prediction . typically, marker platforms have addressed only one of these objectives.


RESULTS
we have developed spiked genotyping-by-sequencing , which combines targeted amplicon sequencing with reduced representation genotyping-by-sequencing. to minimize the cost of targeted assays, we utilize a small percent of sequencing capacity available in runs of gbs libraries to “spike” amplified targets of a priori alleles tagged with a different set of unique barcodes. this open platform allows multiple, single-target loci to be assayed while simultaneously generating a whole-genome profile. this dual-genotyping approach allows different sets of samples to be evaluated for single markers or whole genome-profiling. here, we report the application of sgbs on a winter wheat panel that was screened for converted kasp markers and newly-designed markers targeting known polymorphisms in the leaf rust resistance gene lr <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the flexibility and low-cost of sgbs will enable a range of applications across genetics research. specifically in breeding applications, the sgbs approach will allow breeders to obtain a whole-genome profile of important individuals while simultaneously targeting specific genes for a range of selection strategies across the breeding program.
