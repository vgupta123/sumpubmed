BACKGROUND
clear cell renal cell carcinoma  is the most common type of kidney cancer. recent large-scale next-generation sequencing analyses reveal that pbrm <dig> is the second most frequently mutated gene harboring many truncated mutations and has a suspected tumor suppressor role in ccrcc. however, the biological consequences of pbrm <dig> somatic mutations  that drive tumor progression in ccrcc remain unclear.

methods
in this study, we proposed an integrative genomics approach to explore the functional consequences of pbrm <dig> truncated mutations in ccrcc by incorporating somatic mutations, mrna expression, dna methylation, and microrna  expression profiles from the cancer genome atlas . we performed a systematic analysis to detect the differential molecular features in a total of  <dig> ccrcc samples harboring pbrm <dig> truncated mutations from the  <dig> “pan-negative” ccrcc samples. we excluded the samples that had any of the five high-confidence driver genes  reported in ccrcc to avoid their possible influence in our results.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes  in pbrm <dig> mutated group versus “pan-negative” group. the gene function enrichment analysis revealed that down-regulated genes were significantly enriched in extracellular matrix organization , cell adhesion , and ion transport . surprisingly,  <dig> transcriptional factors  genes including hoxb <dig>  pax <dig> and foxc <dig> were found to be significantly differentially expressed  in pbrm <dig> mutated group compared with “pan-negative” group. in addition, we identified  <dig> differentially methylated cpg sites  and  <dig> significantly altered micrornas  associated with truncated pbrm <dig> mutations. our integrative analysis suggested that methylation and mirna alterations were likely the downstream events associated with pbrm <dig> truncation mutations.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study provided some important insights into the understanding of tumorigenesis driven by pbrm <dig> truncated mutations in ccrcc. the approach may be applied to many driver genes in various cancers.
