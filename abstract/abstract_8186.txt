BACKGROUND
sheep constitute the second major component of livestock in ethiopia. however, efficient utilization of this potential resource is hampered by combination of health problems, poor management and feed shortage. haramaya district is one of the remote settings in ethiopia where information about the livestock disease is not well documented. hence this study was conducted to determine the causative agents and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pasteurella isolates among pneumonic ovine in haramaya district, eastern hararghe, ethiopia.


RESULTS
out of  <dig> samples examined, pasterurella was isolated in  <dig> , of which  <dig>  were from lungs and  <dig>  were from nasal cavities.  <dig> % of the isolates were mannheimia haemolytica and  <dig> % were pasteurella multocida. all of the isolates from the lungs were mannheimia haemolytica whereas 69% of the isolates from nasals cavities were mannheimia haemolytica. age and body temperature were significantly associated with pasteurella isolates from clinic . despite diverse in the site of origins, the isolates exhibited uniformity in sensitivity to a majority of the antibacterial agents. the most effective drug was cholramphenicol  followed by sulfamethoxazole  and tetracycline . both species were completely resistant to gentamycin and vancomycin.


CONCLUSIONS
mannheimia haemolytica is the most common cause of ovine pneumonic pasteurellosis in the study area. the isolates were susceptible to limited antimicrobial agents. therefore, the antimicrobial susceptibility test should be conducted before treatment, except for critical cases.
