BACKGROUND
o-glycosylation of secretory proteins has been found to be an important factor in fungal biology and virulence. it consists in the addition of short glycosidic chains to ser or thr residues in the protein backbone via o-glycosidic bonds. secretory proteins in fungi frequently display ser/thr rich regions that could be sites of extensive o-glycosylation. we have analyzed in silico the complete sets of putatively secretory proteins coded by eight fungal genomes  in search of ser/thr-rich regions as well as regions predicted to be highly o-glycosylated by netoglyc .


RESULTS
by comparison with experimental data, netoglyc was found to overestimate the number of o-glycosylation sites in fungi by a factor of  <dig> , but to be quite reliable in the prediction of highly o-glycosylated regions. about half of secretory proteins have at least one ser/thr-rich region, with a ser/thr content of at least 40% over an average length of  <dig> amino acids. most secretory proteins in filamentous fungi were predicted to be o-glycosylated, sometimes in dozens or even hundreds of sites. residues predicted to be o-glycosylated have a tendency to be grouped together forming hyper-o-glycosylated regions of varying length.


CONCLUSIONS
about one fourth of secretory fungal proteins were predicted to have at least one hyper-o-glycosylated region, which consists of  <dig> amino acids on average and displays at least one o-glycosylated ser or thr every four residues. these putative highly o-glycosylated regions can be found anywhere along the proteins but have a slight tendency to be at either one of the two ends.
