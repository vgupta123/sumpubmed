BACKGROUND
although the patterns of co-substitutions in rna is now well characterized, detection of coevolving positions in proteins remains a difficult task. it has been recognized that the signal is typically weak, due to the fact that  amino-acid are characterized by various biochemical properties, so that distinct amino acids changes are not functionally equivalent, and  a given mutation can be compensated by more than one mutation, at more than one position.


RESULTS
we present a new method based on phylogenetic substitution mapping. the two above-mentioned problems are addressed by  the introduction of a weighted mapping, which accounts for the biochemical effects  of amino-acid changes,  the use of a clustering approach to detect groups of coevolving sites of virtually any size, and  the distinction between biochemical compensation and other coevolutionary mechanisms. we apply this methodology to a previously studied data set of bacterial ribosomal rna, and to three protein data sets .


CONCLUSIONS
we succeed in detecting groups of sites which significantly depart the null hypothesis of independence. group sizes range from pairs to groups of size â‰ƒ  <dig>  depending on the substitution weights used. the structural and functional relevance of these groups of sites are assessed, and the various evolutionary processes potentially generating correlated substitution patterns are discussed.
