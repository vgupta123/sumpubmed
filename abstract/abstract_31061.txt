BACKGROUND
cholera is an acute diarrheal disease caused by vibrio cholerae. outbreaks are caused by a genetically homogenous group of strains from serogroup o <dig> or o <dig> that are able to produce the cholera toxin. rapid detection and identification of these epidemic strains is essential for an effective response to cholera outbreaks.


RESULTS
the use of ferulic acid as a matrix in a new maldi-tof ms assay increased the measurable mass range of existing maldi-tof ms protocols for bacterial identification. the assay enabled rapid discrimination between epidemic v. cholerae o1/o <dig> strains and other less pathogenic v. cholerae strains. ompu, an outer membrane protein whose amino acid sequence is highly conserved among epidemic strains of v. cholerae, appeared as a discriminatory marker in the novel maldi-tof ms assay.


CONCLUSIONS
the extended mass range of maldi-tof ms measurements obtained by using ferulic acid improved the screening for biomarkers in complex protein mixtures. differences in the mass of abundant homologous proteins due to variation in amino acid sequences can rapidly be examined in multiple samples. here, a rapid maldi-tof ms assay was developed that could discriminate between epidemic o1/o <dig> strains and other less pathogenic v. cholerae strains based on differences in mass of the ompu protein. it appeared that the amino acid sequence of ompu from epidemic v. cholerae o1/o <dig> strains is unique and highly conserved.
