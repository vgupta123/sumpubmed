BACKGROUND
the improvement of biomedical properties, e.g. biocompatibility, of poly  by copolymerization is a promising trend in bioengineering. we used strain azotobacter chroococcum 7b, an effective producer of phas, for biosynthesis of not only poly  and its main copolymer, poly , but also alternative copolymer, poly-poly .


RESULTS
in biosynthesis we used sucrose as the primary carbon source and valeric acid or poly  <dig>  as additional carbon sources. the chemical structure of phb-peg and phb-hv was confirmed by 1h nuclear-magnetic resonance  analysis. the physico-chemical properties  and surface morphology of films from phb copolymers were studied. to study copolymers biocompatibility in vitro the protein adsorption and cos- <dig> fibroblasts growth on biopolymer films by xtt assay were analyzed. both copolymers had changed physico-chemical properties compared to phb homopolymer: phb-hv and phb-peg had less crystallinity than phb; phb-hv was more hydrophobic than phb in contrast to phb-peg appeared to have greater hydrophilicity than phb; whereas the morphology of polymer films did not differ significantly. the protein adsorption to phb-peg was greater and more uniform than to phb and phb-peg copolymer promoted better growth of cos- <dig> fibroblasts compared with phb homopolymer.


CONCLUSIONS
thus, despite low eg-monomers content in bacterial origin phb-peg copolymer, this polymer demonstrated significant improvement in biocompatibility in contrast to phb and phb-hv copolymers, which may be coupled with increased protein adsorption and hydrophilicity of peg-containing copolymer.
