BACKGROUND
along with the draft sequencing of the pig genome, which has been completed by an international consortium, collection of the nucleotide sequences of genes expressed in various tissues and determination of entire cdna sequences are necessary for investigations of gene function. the sequences of expressed genes are also useful for genome annotation, which is important for isolating the genes responsible for particular traits.


RESULTS
we performed a large-scale expressed sequence tag  analysis in pigs by using  <dig> full-length-enriched cdna libraries derived from  <dig> kinds of tissues and cells, including seven tissues  derived from pigs that were cloned from a sow subjected to genome sequencing. we obtained more than  <dig>  est reads from the 5â€²-ends of the cdna clones. comparison with human and bovine gene catalogs revealed that the ests corresponded to at least  <dig>  genes. cdna clones representing contigs and singlets generated by assembly of the est reads were subjected to full-length determination of inserts. we have finished sequencing  <dig>  cdna clones corresponding to more than  <dig>  genes. mapping of the sequences of these cdna clones on the draft sequence of the pig genome has indicated that the clones are derived from about  <dig>  independent loci on the pig genome.


CONCLUSIONS
ests and cdna sequences derived from full-length-enriched libraries are valuable for annotation of the draft sequence of the pig genome. this information will also contribute to the exploration of promoter sequences on the genome and to molecular biology-based analyses in pigs.
