BACKGROUND
β-lactam resistance in gram-negative bacteria is a significant clinical problem in the community, long-term care facilities, and hospitals. in these organisms, β-lactam resistance most commonly results from the production of β-lactamases. in gram-negative bacilli, tem-, shv-, and ctx-m-type β-lactamases predominate. therefore, new and accurate detection methods for these β-lactamase producing isolates are needed.


RESULTS
e. coli dh10b cells producing shv- <dig> β-lactamase and a clinical isolate of k. pneumoniae producing shv- <dig> β-lactamase were rendered membrane permeable, fixed and adhered to poly-l-lysine coated slides, and stained with purified polyclonal anti-shv antibodies that were fluorescein labeled. e. coli dh10b cells without a blashv gene were used as a negative control. the procedure generated a fluorescence signal from those slides containing cells expressing shv β-lactamase that was sufficient for direct imaging.


CONCLUSIONS
we developed a rapid and accurate method of visualizing the shv family of enzymes in clinical samples containing gram-negative bacilli using a fluorescein-labeled polyclonal antibody.
