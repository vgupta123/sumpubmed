BACKGROUND
nine gene clusters dedicated to nonribosomal synthesis of secondary metabolites with possible antimicrobial action, including polymyxin and fusaricidin, were detected within the whole genome sequence of the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium  paenibacillus polymyxa m- <dig>  to survey the antimicrobial compounds expressed by m- <dig> we analyzed the active principle suppressing phytopathogenic erwinia spp.


RESULTS
p. polymyxa m- <dig> suppressed the growth of phytopathogenic erwinia amylovora ea  <dig>  and e. carotovora, the causative agents of fire blight and soft rot, respectively. by maldi-tof mass spectrometry and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography , two antibacterial compounds bearing molecular masses of  <dig>  da and  <dig>  da were detected as being the two components of polymyxin p, polymyxin p <dig> and p <dig>  respectively. the active principle acting against the two erwinia strains was isolated from tlc plates and identified by postsource decay -maldi-tof mass spectrometry as polymyxin p <dig> and polymyxin p <dig>  these findings were corroborated by domain structure analysis of the polymyxin  gene cluster detected in the m- <dig> chromosome which revealed that corresponding to the chemical structure of polymyxin p, the gene cluster is encoding d-phe in position  <dig> and l-thr in position  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
identical morphological changes in the cell wall of the bacterial phytopathogens treated with either crude polymyxin p or culture supernatant of m- <dig> corroborated that polymyxin p is the main component of the biocontrol effect exerted by strain m- <dig> against phytopathogenic erwinia spp.
