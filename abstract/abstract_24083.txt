BACKGROUND
the novel mutant allele hsi2- <dig> was isolated in a genetic screen to identify arabidopsis mutants with constitutively elevated expression of a glutathione s-transferase f8::luciferase  reporter gene in arabidopsis. the hsi2- <dig> mutant harbors a point mutation that affects the plant homeodomain -like domain in high-level expression of sugar-inducible gene <dig> /viviparous1/abi3-like <dig> . in hsi2- <dig> seedlings, expression of this luc transgene and certain endogenous seed-maturation genes is constitutively enhanced. the parental reporter line  that was used for mutagenesis harbors two independent transgene loci, kanr and kans. both loci express luciferase whereas only the kanr locus confers resistance to kanamycin.


RESULTS
here we show that both transgene loci harbor multiple tandem insertions at single sites. luciferase expression from these sites is regulated by the hsi <dig> phd-like domain, which is required for the deposition of repressive histone methylation marks  at both kanr and kans loci. expression of luc and neomycin phosphotransferase ii transgenes is associated with dynamic changes in h3k27me <dig> levels, and the activation marks h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> but does not appear to involve repressive h3k9me <dig> marks, dna methylation or histone deacetylation. however, hsi2- <dig> and hsi2- <dig> mutants are partially resistant to growth inhibition associated with exposure to the dna methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. hsi <dig> is also required for the repression of a subset of regulatory and structural seed maturation genes in vegetative tissues and h3k27me <dig> marks associated with most of these genes are also hsi2-dependent.


CONCLUSIONS
these data implicate hsi <dig> phd-like domain in the regulation of gene expression involving histone modifications and dna methylation-mediated epigenetic mechanisms.
