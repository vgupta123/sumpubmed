BACKGROUND
the class ii dna transposons are mobile genetic elements that move dna sequence from one position in the genome to another. we have previously demonstrated that the naturally occurring tol <dig> element from oryzias latipes efficiently integrates its corresponding non-autonomous transposable element into the genome of the diploid frog, xenopus tropicalis. tol <dig> transposons are stable in the frog genome and are transmitted to the offspring at the expected mendelian frequency.


RESULTS
to test whether tol <dig> transposons integrated in the xenopus tropicalis genome are substrates for remobilization, we injected in vitro transcribed tol <dig> mrna into one-cell embryos harbouring a single copy of a tol <dig> transposon. integration site analysis of injected embryos from two founder lines showed at least one somatic remobilization event per embryo. we also demonstrate that the remobilized transposons are transmitted through the germline and re-integration can result in the generation of novel gfp expression patterns in the developing tadpole. although the parental line contained a single tol <dig> transposon, the resulting remobilized tadpoles frequently inherit multiple copies of the transposon. this is likely to be due to the tol <dig> transposase acting in discrete blastomeres of the developing injected embryo during the cell cycle after dna synthesis but prior to mitosis.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we demonstrate that single copy tol <dig> transposons integrated into the xenopus tropicalis genome are effective substrates for excision and random re-integration and that the remobilized transposons are transmitted through the germline. this is an important step in the development of 'transposon hopping' strategies for insertional mutagenesis, gene trap and enhancer trap screens in this highly tractable developmental model organism.
