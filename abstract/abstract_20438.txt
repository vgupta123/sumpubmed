BACKGROUND
cowpea, vigna unguiculata l. walp., is one of the most important food and forage legumes in the semi-arid tropics. while most domesticated forms of cowpea are susceptible to the root parasitic weed striga gesnerioides, several cultivars have been identified that show race-specific resistance. cowpea cultivar b <dig> contains the rsg3- <dig> gene for resistance to s. gesnerioides race sg <dig>  but is susceptible to race sg4z. when challenged by sg <dig>  roots of cultivar b <dig> develop a strong resistance response characterized by a hypersensitive reaction and cell death at the site of parasite attachment. in contrast, no visible response occurs in b <dig> roots parasitized by sg4z.


RESULTS
gene expression in the roots of the cowpea cultivar b <dig> during compatible  and incompatible  interactions with s. gesnerioides races sg4z and sg <dig>  respectively, were investigated at the early ) and late  stages of the resistance response using a nimblegen custom design cowpea microarray. a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in b <dig> roots at  <dig> dpi; this number increased to  <dig> genes at  <dig> dpi. at  <dig> dpi, a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed during compatible  interactions of b <dig> with sg4z. genes and pathways involved in signal transduction, programmed cell death and apoptosis, and defense response to biotic and abiotic stress were differentially expressed in the early resistance response; at the later time point, enrichment was primarily for defense-related gene expression, and genes encoding components of lignifications and secondary wall formation. in compatible interactions , multiple defense pathways were repressed, including those involved in lignin biosynthesis and secondary cell wall modifications, while cellular transport processes for nitrogen and sulfur were increased.


CONCLUSIONS
distinct changes in global gene expression profiles occur in host roots following successful and unsuccessful attempted parasitism by striga. induction of specific defense related genes and pathways defines components of a unique resistance mechanism. some genes and pathways up-regulated in the host resistance response to sg <dig> are repressed in the susceptible interactions, suggesting that the parasite is targeting specific components of the hostâ€™s defense. these results add to our understanding of plant-parasite interactions and the evolution of resistance to parasitic weeds.
