BACKGROUND
the automated extraction of gene and/or protein interactions from the literature is one of the most important targets of biomedical text mining research. in this paper we present a realistic evaluation of gene/protein interaction mining relevant to potential non-specialist users. hence we have specifically avoided methods that are complex to install or require reimplementation, and we coupled our chosen extraction methods with a state-of-the-art biomedical named entity tagger.


RESULTS
our results show: that performance across different evaluation corpora is extremely variable; that the use of tagged  gene and protein names has a significant impact on performance, with a drop in f-score of over  <dig> percentage points being commonplace; and that a simple keyword-based benchmark algorithm when coupled with a named entity tagger outperforms two of the tools most widely used to extract gene/protein interactions.


CONCLUSIONS
in terms of availability, ease of use and performance, the potential non-specialist user community interested in automatically extracting gene and/or protein interactions from free text is poorly served by current tools and systems. the public release of extraction tools that are easy to install and use, and that achieve state-of-art levels of performance should be treated as a high priority by the biomedical text mining community.
