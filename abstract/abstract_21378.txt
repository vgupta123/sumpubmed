BACKGROUND
nonclassical  protein secretion is thought to represent the primary secretion mechanism for several cytosolic proteins, such as hiv-tat, galectin  <dig>  interleukin-1Î², and several proteins that shuttle between the nucleus and cytosol, such as fibroblast growth factor  <dig> , fgf <dig>  and nucleolin. four nonclassical secretory pathways have been described including direct transport , secretion via exosomes, lysosomal secretion, and blebbing. the purpose of this study was to gain mechanistic insight into nonclassical protein secretion using phosphoglycerate kinase  <dig> , a previously identified nonclassical secretory protein, as a reporter protein.


RESULTS
upon shifting hela cells into serum-free media pgk <dig> was released as a free soluble protein without cell loss. release occurred in two phases: a rapid early phase and a slow late phase. using a repertory of inhibitors, pgk <dig> release was shown not to rely on the classical secretory pathway. however, components of the cytoskeleton partially contributed to its release. significantly, the presence of serum or bovine serum albumin in the media inhibited pgk <dig> release.


CONCLUSIONS
these results are consistent with a novel model of protein release termed oncotic release, in which a change in the colloidal osmotic pressure  upon serum withdrawal creates nonlethal oncotic pores in the plasma membrane through which pgk <dig> - and likely other nearby proteins - are released before the pores are rapidly resealed. these findings identify an alternative mechanism of release for fgf <dig>  hiv-tat, and galectin  <dig> whose reported nonclassical secretion is induced by serum withdrawal. oncotic release may occur in routine cell biological experiments during which cells are washed with serum-free buffers or media and in pathophysiological conditions, such as edema, during which extracellular protein concentrations change.
