BACKGROUND
the immunoglobulins  and the t cell receptors  play the key role in antigen recognition during the adaptive immune response. recent progress in next-generation sequencing technologies has provided an opportunity for the deep t cell receptor repertoire profiling. however, a specialised software is required for the rational analysis of massive data generated by next-generation sequencing.


RESULTS
here we introduce tcr, a new r package, representing a platform for the advanced analysis of t cell receptor repertoires, which includes diversity measures, shared t cell receptor sequences identification, gene usage statistics computation and other widely used methods. the tool has proven its utility in recent research studies.


CONCLUSIONS
tcr is an r package for the advanced analysis of t cell receptor repertoires after primary tr sequences extraction from raw sequencing reads. the stable version can be directly installed from the comprehensive r archive network . the source code and development version are available at tcr github  along with the full documentation and typical usage examples.
