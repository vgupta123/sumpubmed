BACKGROUND
gabaa receptor subunit composition has a profound effect on the receptor’s physiological and pharmacological properties. the receptor β subunit is widely recognised for its importance in receptor assembly, trafficking and post-translational modifications, but its influence on extrasynaptic gabaa receptor function is less well understood. here, we examine the pharmacological properties of a potentially native extrasynaptic gabaa receptor that incorporates the β <dig> subunit, specifically composed of α4β1δ and α4β <dig> subunits.


RESULTS
gaba activated concentration-dependent responses at α4β1δ and α4β <dig> receptors with ec <dig> values in the nanomolar to micromolar range, respectively. the divalent cations zn2+ and cu2+, and the β1-selective inhibitor salicylidine salicylhydrazide , inhibited gaba-activated currents at α4β1δ receptors. surprisingly the α4β <dig> receptor demonstrated biphasic sensitivity to zn2+ inhibition that may reflect variable subunit stoichiometries with differing sensitivity to zn2+. the neurosteroid tetrahydro-deoxycorticosterone  significantly increased gaba-initiated responses in concentrations above  <dig> nm for α4β1δ receptors.


CONCLUSIONS
with this study we report the first pharmacological characterisation of various gabaa receptor ligands acting at murine α4β1δ gabaa receptors, thereby improving our understanding of the molecular pharmacology of this receptor isoform. this study highlights some notable differences in the pharmacology of murine and human α4β1δ receptors. we consider the likelihood that the α4β1δ receptor may play a role as an extrasynaptic gabaa receptor in the nervous system.
