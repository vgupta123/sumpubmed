BACKGROUND
ferredoxins are small iron-sulfur proteins belonging to all domains of life. a sub-group binds two  clusters with unequal and extremely low values of the reduction potentials. these unusual properties are associated with two specific fragments of sequence. the functional importance of the very low potential ferredoxins is unknown.


RESULTS
a bioinformatic screening of the sequence features defining very low potential  <dig> ferredoxins has revealed the almost exclusive presence of the corresponding fdx gene in the proteobacteria phylum, without occurrence in archaea and eukaryota. the transcript was found to be monocistronic in pseudomonas aeruginosa, and not part of an operon in most bacteria. only fdx genes of bacteria which anaerobically degrade aromatic compounds belong to operons. as this pathway is not present in all bacteria having very low potential  <dig> ferredoxins, these proteins cannot exclusively be reductants of benzoyl coa reductases. expression of the ferredoxin gene did not change in response to varying growth conditions, including upon macrophage infection or aerobic growth with 4-hydroxy benzoate as carbon source. however, it increased along the growth curve in pseudomonas aeruginosa and in escherichia coli. the sequence immediately 5' upstream of the coding sequence contributed to the promotor activity. deleting the fdx gene in pseudomonas aeruginosa abolished growth, unless a plasmid copy of the gene was provided to the deleted strain.


CONCLUSIONS
the gene of the very low potential  <dig> ferredoxin displays characteristics of a housekeeping gene, and it belongs to the minority of genes that are essential in pseudomonas aeruginosa. these data identify a new potential antimicrobial target in this and other pathogenic proteobacteria.
