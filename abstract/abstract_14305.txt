BACKGROUND
the human dopamine d <dig> receptor  gene has been studied extensively as a candidate gene for certain psychological traits and several behavioural and psychiatric disorders. both the 5' regulatory region and the coding sequence contain a number of polymorphisms. the promoter variants have received particular attention in the past few years due to their possible role in the regulation of gene transcription. previously, the -521c/t snp was shown to influence promoter activity. the aim of this study is to perform an in-depth analysis of this effect in the context of various neural cell lines.


RESULTS
endogenous mrna expression of the drd <dig> gene was demonstrated in two neuroblastoma  and one retinoblastoma cell line  by rt-pcr. in addition, very low drd <dig> mrna levels were also detected in hela cells. the transcriptional activity of a series of 5' promoter deletion mutants was determined by transient transfection of luciferase reporter constructs. the activity profile of these promoter fragments was similar in each of the cell lines tested. the highest luciferase reporter activity was obtained with a construct containing promoter sequences between nucleotides - <dig> to - <dig>  while a putative silencer region was localised spanning from nucleotide - <dig> to - <dig>  surprisingly, the - <dig> c/t polymorphism had no significant effect on transcriptional activity of the reporter construct with the highest activity  in any of the three cell lines tested.


CONCLUSIONS
our results do not confirm previous data assigning different transcriptional activities to the - <dig> c/t alleles of the human drd <dig> promoter. furthermore, these findings highlight the need for further characterization of the 5' regulatory region of the drd <dig> gene and identification of additional functional promoter polymorphic sites, especially in the context of haplotype.
