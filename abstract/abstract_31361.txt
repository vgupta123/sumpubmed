BACKGROUND
cotton, as an allopolyploid species, contains homoeologous a and d subgenomes. the study of the homoeologous  segments or chromosomes can facilitate insight into the evolutionary process of polyploidy and the development of genomic resources. fluorescence in situ hybridization  using bacterial artificial chromosome  clones as probes has commonly been used to provide a reliable cytological technique for chromosome identification. in polyploids, it also presents a useful approach for identification and localization of duplicated segments. here, two types of bacs that contained the duplicated segments were isolated and analyzed in tetraploid cotton by fish.


RESULTS
homologous and homoeologous bacs were isolated by way of ssr marker-based selection and then used to develop bac-fish probes. duplicated segments in homoeologous chromosomes were detected by fish. the fish and related linkage map results followed known reinforced the relationships of homoeologous chromosomes in allotetraploid cotton, and presented a useful approach for isolation of homoeologous loci or segments and for mapping of monomorphic loci. it is very important to find that the large duplicated segments  do exist between homoeologous chromosomes, so the shot-gun approach for genome sequencing was unavailable for tetraploid cotton. however, without doubt, it will contain more information and promote the research for duplicated segments as well as the genome evolution in cotton.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings and the analysis method by bac-fish demonstrated the powerful nature and wide use for the genome and genome evolutionary researches in cotton and other polyploidy species.
