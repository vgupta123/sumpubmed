BACKGROUND
epidermal growth factor receptor  is a key target molecule in current treatment of several neoplastic diseases. hence, in order to develop and improve current drugs targeting egfr signalling, an accurate understanding of how this signalling pathway is regulated is required. it has recently been demonstrated that inhibition of camp-dependent protein kinase  induces a ligand-independent internalization of egfr. cyclic-amp-dependent protein kinase consists of a regulatory dimer bound to two catalytic subunits.


RESULTS
we have investigated the effect on egfr levels after ablating the two catalytic subunits, cα and cβ in two different models. the first model used targeted disruption of either cα or cβ in mice whereas the second model used cα and cβ rna interference in hela cells. in both models we observed a significant reduction of egfr expression at the protein but not mrna level.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that pka may represent a target that when manipulated can maintain egfr protein levels at the single cell level as well as in intact animals.
