BACKGROUND
the global pattern of distribution of  <dig> b. anthracis isolates has previously been defined by a set of  <dig> conserved canonical single nucleotide polymorphisms . these studies reinforced the presence of three major lineages and  <dig> sub-lineages and sub-groups of this anthrax-causing pathogen. isolates that form the a lineage  have become widely dispersed throughout the world and form the basis for the geographical disposition of "modern" anthrax. an archival collection of  <dig> different b. anthracis isolates from china provides a glimpse into the possible role of chinese trade and commerce in the spread of certain sub-lineages of this pathogen. canonical single nucleotide polymorphism  and multiple locus vntr analysis  typing has been used to examine this archival collection of isolates.


RESULTS
the cansnp study indicates that there are  <dig> different sub-lineages/sub-groups in china out of  <dig> previously described world-wide cansnp genotypes. three of these cansnp genotypes were only found in the western-most province of china, xinjiang. these genotypes were a.br.008/ <dig>  a sub-group that is spread across most of europe and asia; a.br.aust  <dig>  a sub-lineage that is present in europe and india, and a.br.vollum, a lineage that is also present in europe. the remaining two cansnp genotypes are spread across the whole of china and belong to sub-group a.br.001/ <dig> and the a.br.ames sub-lineage, two closely related genotypes. mlva typing adds resolution to the isolates in each cansnp genotype and diversity indices for the a.br.008/ <dig> and a.br.001/ <dig> sub-groups suggest that these represent older and established clades in china.


CONCLUSIONS
b. anthracis isolates were recovered from three cansnp sub-groups  in the western most portion of the large chinese province of xinjiang. the city of kashi in this province appears to have served as a crossroads for not only trade but the movement of diseases such as anthrax along the ancient "silk road". phylogenetic inference also suggests that the a.br.ames sub-lineage, first identified in the original ames strain isolated from jim hogg county, tx, is descended from the a.br.001/ <dig> sub-group that has a major presence in most of china. these results suggest a genetic discontinuity between the younger ames sub-lineage in texas and the large western north american sub-lineage spread across central canada and the dakotas.
