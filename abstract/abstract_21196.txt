BACKGROUND
rnamute is an interactive java application that calculates the secondary structure of all single point mutations, given an rna sequence, and organizes them into categories according to their similarity with respect to the wild type predicted structure. the secondary structure predictions are performed using the vienna rna package. several alternatives are used for the categorization of single point mutations: vienna's rnadistance based on dot-bracket representation, as well as tree edit distance and second eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix based on shapiro's coarse grain tree graph representation.


RESULTS
selecting a category in each one of the processed tables lists all single point mutations belonging to that category. selecting a mutation displays a graphical drawing of the single point mutation and the wild type, and includes basic information such as associated energies, representations and distances. rnamute can be used successfully with very little previous experience and without choosing any parameter value alongside the initial rna sequence. the package runs under linux operating system.


CONCLUSIONS
rnamute is a user friendly tool that can be used to predict single point mutations leading to conformational rearrangements in the secondary structure of rnas. in several cases of substantial interest, notably in virology, a point mutation may lead to a loss of important functionality such as the rna virus replication and translation initiation because of a conformational rearrangement in the secondary structure.
