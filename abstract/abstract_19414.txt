BACKGROUND
mast cell tumors  are the most common skin tumors in dogs and exhibit variable biologic behavior. mutations in the c-kit proto-oncogene are associated with the tumorigenesis of mcts, resulting in growth factor-independent and constitutive phosphorylation of the kit receptor tyrosine kinase . toceranib  phosphate  is a kit rtk inhibitor that has biological activity against mcts. despite these benefits, patients ultimately develop resistance to toc. therefore, there is a need to identify distinguishing clinical and molecular features of resistance in this population.


RESULTS
the canine c <dig> mastocytoma cell line contains an activating mutation in c-kit. three toc-resistant c <dig> sublines  were established over seven months by growing cells in increasing concentrations of toc. toc inhibited kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in the treatment-na√Øve, parental c <dig> line . in contrast, the three sublines were resistant to growth inhibition by toc  and phosphorylation of the kit receptor was less inhibited compared to the toc-sensitive c <dig> cells. interestingly, sensitivity to three structurally distinct kit rtk inhibitors was variable among the sublines, and all  <dig> sublines retained sensitivity to the cytotoxic agents vinblastine and lomustine. sequencing of c-kit revealed secondary mutations in the juxtamembrane and tyrosine kinase domains of the resistant sublines. these included point mutations in tr <dig> , tr <dig> , and tr <dig> . additionally, chronic toc exposure resulted in c-kit mrna and kit protein overexpression in the toc-resistant sublines compared to the parental line. c <dig>  tr <dig>  tr <dig>  and tr <dig> cells demonstrated minimal p-glycoprotein  activity and no functional p-gp.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates the development of an in vitro model of acquired resistance to targeted therapy in canine mcts harboring a c-kit-activating mutation. this model may be used to investigate the molecular basis of and strategies to overcome toc resistance.
