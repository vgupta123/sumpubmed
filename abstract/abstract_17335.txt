BACKGROUND
the cosmetics market has rapidly increased over the last years. for example, in  <dig> it reached  <dig>  billion us dollars, which was a  <dig> % increase compared to  <dig>  there have been many recent trials aimed at finding the functional ingredients for new cosmetics. gallic acid is a phytochemical derived from various herbs, and has anti-fungal, anti-viral, and antioxidant properties. although phytochemicals are useful as cosmetic ingredients, they have a number of drawbacks, such as thermal stability, residence time in the skin, and permeability through the dermal layer. to overcome these problems, we considered conjugation of gallic acid with a peptide.


RESULTS
we synthesized galloyl-rgd, which represents a conjugate of gallic acid and the peptide rgd, purified it by hplc and characterized by maldi-tof with the aim of using it as a new cosmetic ingredient. thermal stability of galloyl-rgd was tested at alternating temperatures  on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  galloyl-rgd was relatively safe to hacat keratinocytes, as their viability after 48 h incubation with 500 ppm galloyl-rgd was  <dig> %. in the group treated with 50 ppm galloyl-rgd,  <dig> % of free radicals were removed, whereas 1000 ppm galloyl-rgd suppressed not only l-dopa formation  but also l-dopa oxidation .


CONCLUSIONS
galloyl-rgd is a promising candidate for a cosmetic ingredient.
