BACKGROUND
foamy virus bel1/tas trans-activators act as key regulators of gene expression and directly bind to bel <dig> response elements  in both the internal and the 5'ltr promoters leading to strong transcriptional trans-activation. cellular coactivators interacting with bel1/tas are unknown to date.


RESULTS
transient expression assays, co-immunoprecipitation experiments, pull-down assays, and western blot analysis were used to demonstrate that the coactivator p <dig> and histone acetyltransferase pcaf specifically interact with the retroviral trans-activator bel1/tas in vivo. here we show that the bel1/tas-mediated trans-activation was enhanced by the coactivator p <dig>  histone acetyltransferases pcaf and src- <dig> based on the crucial internal promoter bre. the bel1/tas-interacting region was mapped to the c/h <dig> domain of p <dig> by co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays. in contrast, coactivator src- <dig> previously reported to bind to the c-terminal domain of p <dig> did not directly interact with the bel <dig> protein but nevertheless enhanced bel1/tas-mediated trans-activation. cotransfection of bel1/tas and p300c with an expression plasmid containing the c/h1domain partially inhibited the p300c-driven trans-activation.


CONCLUSIONS
our data identify p <dig> and pcaf as functional partner molecules that directly interact with bel1/tas. since the acetylation activities of the three coactivators reside in or bind to the c-terminal regions of p <dig>  a c/h <dig> expression plasmid was used as inhibitor. this is the first report of a c/h <dig> domain-interacting retroviral trans-activator capable of partially blocking the strong bel1/tas-mediated activation of the c-terminal region of coactivator p <dig>  the potential mechanisms and functional roles of the three histone and factor acetyltransferases p <dig>  pcaf, and src- <dig> in bel1/tas-mediated trans-activation are discussed.
