BACKGROUND
microbial proteases are one of the most commercially valuable enzymes, of which the largest market share has been taken by subtilases or alkaline proteases of the bacillus species. despite a large amount of information on microbial proteases, a search for novel proteases with unique properties is still of interest for both basic and applied aspects of this highly complex class of enzymes. oxidant stable proteases  have been shown to have a wide application in the detergent and bleaching industries and recently have become one of the most attractive enzymes in various biotechnological applications.


RESULTS
a gene encoding a novel member of the subtilase superfamily was isolated from virgibacillus sp. sk <dig>  a protease-producing bacterium isolated from thai fish sauce fermentation. the gene was cloned by an activity-based screening of a genomic dna expression library on luria-bertani  agar plates containing  <dig> mm iptg and 3% skim milk. of the  <dig>  clones screened, all six isolated positive clones comprised one overlapping open reading frame of 45% identity to the aprx gene from bacillus species. this gene, designated aprx-sk <dig> was cloned into pet21d and over-expressed in e. coli bl <dig>  the enzyme product, designated aprx-sk <dig>  was purified by an immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography to apparent homogeneity and characterized. the aprx-sk <dig> enzyme showed optimal catalytic conditions at ph  <dig>  and 55Â°c, based on the azocasein assay containing  <dig> mm cacl <dig>  maximum catalytic activity was found at  <dig> m nacl with residual activity of 30% at  <dig> m nacl. thermal stability of the enzyme was also enhanced by  <dig> m nacl. the enzyme was absolutely calcium-dependent, with optimal concentration of cacl <dig> at  <dig> mm. inhibitory effects by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid indicated that this enzyme is a metal-dependent serine protease. the enzyme activity was sensitive towards reducing agents, urea, and sds, but relatively stable up to 5% of h2o <dig>  phylogenetic analysis suggested that aprx-sk <dig> belongs to a novel family of the subtilase superfamily. we propose the name of this new family as alkaline serine protease-x .


CONCLUSIONS
the stability towards h2o <dig> and moderately halo- and thermo-tolerant properties of the aprx-sk <dig> enzyme are attractive for various biotechnological applications.
