BACKGROUND
methamphetamine  dependence presents a substantial socioeconomic burden. despite the need, there is no fda-approved pharmacotherapy for psychostimulant dependence. we consider 5-ht2c receptors as viable therapeutic targets. we recently revealed that the atypical antidepressant, mirtazapine, attenuates meth-seeking in a rodent model of human substance abuse. mirtazapine historically has been considered to be an antagonist at 5-ht2c receptors, but more recently shown to exhibit inverse agonism at constitutively active 5-ht2c receptors. to help distinguish the roles for antagonism vs. inverse agonism, here we explored the ability of a more selective 5-ht2c inverse agonist, sb  <dig> to attenuate meth-seeking behavior, and compared its effects to those obtained with 5-ht2c antagonists, sdz ser  <dig> and sb  <dig>  to do so, rats were trained to self-administer meth and tested for seeking-like behavior in cue reactivity sessions consisting of contingently presenting meth-associated cues without meth reinforcement. we also explored motor function to determine the influence of sb  <dig> and sdz ser  <dig> on motor activity in the presence and absence of meth.


RESULTS
like mirtazapine, pretreatment with sb  <dig> , attenuated meth-seeking. in contrast, the antagonists, sdz ser  <dig>  and sb  <dig>  had no effect on cue reactivity . sb  <dig>  failed to attenuate the effects of  <dig>  and 10â€‰mg/kg sb  <dig> on cr. motor function was largely unaltered by the 5-ht2c ligands; however, sb  <dig>  at the highest dose tested , attenuated meth-induced rearing behavior.


CONCLUSIONS
the lack of effect by 5-ht2c antagonists suggests that meth-seeking and meth-evoked motor activity are independent of endogenous 5-ht acting at 5-ht2c receptors. while sb  <dig> dramatically impacted meth-evoked behaviors it is unclear whether the observed effects were 5-ht2c receptor mediated. thus, sb  <dig> deserves further attention in the study of psychostimulant abuse disorders.
