BACKGROUND
the  <dig> ph1n <dig> influenza pandemic resulted in at least  <dig>  deaths worldwide. while ph1n <dig> is now considered to be in a post-pandemic stage in humans it has nevertheless spilled back into swine in at least  <dig> countries. understanding the factors that increase the risk of spillover events between swine and humans is essential to predicting and preventing future outbreaks. we assessed risk factors that may have led to spillover of ph1n <dig> from humans to swine in cameroon, central africa. we sampled swine, domestic poultry and wild birds for influenza a virus at twelve sites in cameroon from december  <dig> while the pandemic was ongoing, to august  <dig>  at the same time we conducted point-count surveys to assess the abundance of domestic livestock and wild birds and assess interspecific contact rates. random forest models were used to assess which variables were the best predictors of influenza in swine.


RESULTS
we found swine with either active ph1n <dig> infections or positive for influenza a at four of our  <dig> sites. only one swine tested positive by competitive elisa in 2011- <dig>  to date we have found ph1n <dig> only in the north and extreme north regions of cameroon , though half of our sites are in the central and western regions. swine husbandry practices differ between the north and extreme north regions where it is common practice in to let swine roam freely, and the central and western regions where swine are typically confined to pens. random forest analyses revealed that the three best predictors of the presence of ph1n <dig> in swine were contact rates between free-ranging swine and domestic ducks, contact rates between free-ranging swine and wild columbiformes, and contact rates between humans and ducks. sites in which swine were allowed to range freely had closer contact with other species than did sites in which swine were kept penned.


CONCLUSIONS
results suggest that the practice of allowing swine to roam freely is a significant risk factor for spillover of influenza from humans into swine populations.
