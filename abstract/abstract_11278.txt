BACKGROUND
information about the composition of regulatory regions is of great value for designing experiments to functionally characterize gene expression. the multiplicity of available applications to predict transcription factor binding sites in a particular locus contrasts with the substantial computational expertise that is demanded to manipulate them, which may constitute a potential barrier for the experimental community.


RESULTS
cbs  is a public platform of evolutionarily conserved binding sites and enhancers predicted in multiple drosophila genomes that is furnished with published chromatin signatures associated to transcriptionally active regions and other experimental sources of information. the rapid access to this novel body of knowledge through a user-friendly web interface enables non-expert users to identify the binding sequences available for any particular gene, transcription factor, or genome region.


CONCLUSIONS
the cbs platform is a powerful resource that provides tools for data mining individual sequences and groups of co-expressed genes with epigenomics information to conduct regulatory screenings in drosophila.
