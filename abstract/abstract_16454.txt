BACKGROUND
an introgression library is a family of near-isogenic lines in a common genetic background, each of which carries one or more genomic regions contributed by a donor genome. near-isogenic lines are powerful genetic resources for the analysis of phenotypic variation and are important for map-base cloning genes underlying mutations and traits. with many thousands of distinct genotypes, querying introgression libraries for lines of interest is an issue. 


RESULTS
we have created iview, a tool to graphically display and query near-isogenic line libraries for specific introgressions. this tool incorporates a web interface for displaying the location and extent of introgressions. each genetic marker is associated with a position on a reference map. users can search for introgressions using marker names, or chromosome number and map positions. this search results in a display of lines carrying an introgression at the specified position. upon selecting one of the lines, color-coded introgressions on all chromosomes of the line are displayed graphically.

the source code for iview can be downloaded from http://xrl.us/iview. 


CONCLUSIONS
iview will be useful for those wanting to make introgression data from their stock of germplasm searchable.
