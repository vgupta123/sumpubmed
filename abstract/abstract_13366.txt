BACKGROUND
constrained minimal cut sets  have recently been introduced as a framework to enumerate minimal genetic intervention strategies for targeted optimization of metabolic networks. two different algorithmic schemes  have been proposed to compute cmcss from elementary modes. however, in their original formulation both algorithms are not fully comparable.


RESULTS
here we show that by a small extension to the integer program both methods become equivalent. furthermore, based on well-known preprocessing procedures for integer programming we present efficient preprocessing steps which can be used for both algorithms. we then benchmark the numerical performance of the algorithms in several realistic medium-scale metabolic models. the benchmark calculations reveal  that these preprocessing steps can lead to an enormous speed-up under both algorithms, and  that the adapted berge algorithm outperforms the binary integer approach.


CONCLUSIONS
generally, both of our new implementations are by at least one order of magnitude faster than other currently available implementations.
