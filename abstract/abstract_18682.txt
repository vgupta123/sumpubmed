BACKGROUND
the generation of energy from glucose is impaired in diabetes and can be compensated by other substrates like fatty acids . little information is available on amino acids  as alternative energy-source in diabetes. to study the interaction between insulin-stimulated glucose and aa utilization in normal and diabetic subjects, intraportal hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic euaminoacidaemic clamp studies were performed in normal  and streptozotocin  induced diabetic  pigs of ~40- <dig> kg.


RESULTS
diabetic vs normal pigs showed basal hyperglycaemia  and at the level of individual aa, basal concentrations of valine and histidine were increased  whereas tyrosine, alanine, asparagine, glutamine, glutamate, glycine and serine were decreased . during the clamp, diabetic vs normal pigs showed reduced insulin-stimulated glucose clearance  but increased aa clearance  at matched arterial euglycaemia  and euaminoacidaemia . the increase in aa clearance was mainly caused by an increase in non-essential aa clearance , in particular alanine . essential aa clearance was largely unchanged , however clearances of threonine  and tyrosine  were increased in diabetic vs normal pigs .


CONCLUSIONS
the ratio of insulin-stimulated glucose versus aa clearance was decreased  <dig> -fold in diabetic pigs, which was caused by a  <dig> -fold decrease in glucose clearance and a  <dig> -fold increase in non-essential aa clearance. in parallel with the randle concept , the present data suggest the existence of a glucose and non-essential aa substrate interaction in diabetic pigs whereby reduced insulin-stimulated glucose clearance seems to be partly compensated by an increase in non-essential aa clearance whereas essential aa are preferentially spared from an increase in clearance.
