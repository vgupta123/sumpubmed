BACKGROUND
lactococcus lactis is used in dairy food fermentation and for the efficient production of industrially relevant enzymes. the genome content and different phenotypes have been determined for multiple l. lactis strains in order to understand intra-species genotype and phenotype diversity and annotate gene functions. in this study, we identified relations between gene presence and a collection of  <dig> phenotypes across  <dig> l. lactis strains of dairy and plant origin. gene occurrence and phenotype data were used in an iterative gene selection procedure, based on the random forest algorithm, to identify genotype-phenotype relations.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> gene-phenotype relations were found, of which some confirmed known gene-phenotype relations, such as the importance of arabinose utilization genes only for strains of plant origin. we also identified a gene cluster related to growth on melibiose, a plant disaccharide; this cluster is present only in melibiose-positive strains and can be used as a genetic marker in trait improvement. additionally, several novel gene-phenotype relations were uncovered, for instance, genes related to arsenite resistance or arginine metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that genotype-phenotype matching by integrating large data sets provides the possibility to identify gene-phenotype relations, possibly improve gene function annotation and identified relations can be used for screening bacterial culture collections for desired phenotypes. in addition to all gene-phenotype relations, we also provide coherent phenotype data for  <dig> lactococcus strains assessed in  <dig> different phenotyping experiments, which to our knowledge is the largest to date for the lactococcus lactis species.
