BACKGROUND
nitrogen  is the most common limiting factor for crop productivity worldwide. an effective approach to solve n deficiency is to develop low n  tolerant crop cultivars. tibetan annual wild barley is well-known for its wide genetic diversity and high tolerance to poor soil fertility. up to date, no study has been done to illustrate the mechanism of ln tolerance underlying the wild barley at transcriptional level.


RESULTS
in this study, we employed illumina rna-sequencing to determine the genotypic difference in transcriptome profile using two tibetan wild barley genotypes differing in ln tolerance . a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes  were identified in the two genotypes at 6 h and 48 h after ln treatment. genetic difference existed in degs between xz <dig> and xz <dig>  including transporters, transcription factors , kinases, antioxidant stress and hormone signaling related genes. meanwhile,  <dig> ln tolerance-associated degs were mainly mapped to amino acid metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism and secondary metabolism, and involved in transporter activity, antioxidant activities, and other gene ontology . xz <dig> had a higher capability of n absorption and use efficiency under ln stress than xz <dig>  the higher expression of nitrate transporters and energy-saving assimilation pattern could be attributed to its more n uptake and higher ln tolerance. in addition, auxin  and ethylene  response pathways may be also related to the genotypic difference in ln tolerance.


CONCLUSIONS
the responses of xz <dig> and xz <dig> to ln stress differed dramatically at transcriptional level. the identified candidate genes related to ln tolerance may provide new insights into comprehensive understanding of the genotypic difference in n utilization and ln tolerance.
