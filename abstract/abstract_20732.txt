BACKGROUND
the suprachiasmatic nucleus  contains the master circadian clock that regulates daily rhythms of many physiological and behavioural processes in mammals. previously we have shown that prokineticin  <dig>  is a clock-controlled gene that may function as a critical scn output molecule responsible for circadian locomotor rhythms. as light is the principal zeitgeber that entrains the circadian oscillator, and pk <dig> expression is responsive to nocturnal light pulses, we further investigated the effects of light on the molecular rhythm of pk <dig> in the scn. in particular, we examined how pk <dig> responds to shifts of light/dark cycles and changes in photoperiod. we also investigated which photoreceptors are responsible for the light-induced pk <dig> expression in the scn. to determine whether light requires an intact functional circadian pacemaker to regulate pk <dig>  we examined pk <dig> expression in cryptochrome <dig> -deficient  mice that lack functional circadian clock under normal light/dark cycles and constant darkness.


RESULTS
upon abrupt shifts of the light/dark cycle, pk <dig> expression exhibits transients in response to phase advances but rapidly entrains to phase delays. photoperiod studies indicate that pk <dig> responds differentially to changes in light period. although the phase of pk <dig> expression expands as the light period increases, decreasing light period does not further condense the phase of pk <dig> expression. genetic knockout studies revealed that functional melanopsin and rod-cone photoreceptive systems are required for the light-inducibility of pk <dig>  in cry1-/-cry2-/- mice that lack a functional circadian clock, a low amplitude pk <dig> rhythm is detected under light/dark conditions, but not in constant darkness. this suggests that light can directly regulate pk <dig> expression in the scn.


CONCLUSIONS
these data demonstrate that the molecular rhythm of pk <dig> in the scn is regulated by both the circadian clock and light. pk <dig> is predominantly controlled by the endogenous circadian clock, while light plays a modulatory role. the cry1-/-cry2-/- mice studies reveal a light-driven pk <dig> rhythm, indicating that light can induce pk <dig> expression independent of the circadian oscillator. the light inducibility of pk <dig> suggests that in addition to its role in clock-driven rhythms of locomotor behaviour, pk <dig> may also participate in the photic entrainment of circadian locomotor rhythms.
