BACKGROUND
the arabidopsis thaliana dgat <dig> mutant, as <dig>  has an oil content which is decreased by 30%, and a strongly increased ratio of 18:3/20: <dig>  compared to wild type. despite lacking a functional dgat <dig>  as <dig> still manages to make 70% of wt seed oil levels. recently, it was demonstrated that in the absence of dgat <dig>  pdat <dig> was essential for normal seed development, and is a dominant determinant in arabidopsis tag biosynthesis.

methods
biochemical, metabolic and gene expression studies combined with genetic crossing of selected arabidopsis mutants have been carried out to demonstrate the contribution of arabidopsis pdat <dig> and lpcat <dig> in the absence of dgat <dig> activity.


RESULTS
through microarray and rt-pcr gene expression analyses of as <dig> vs. wt mid-developing siliques, we observed consistent trends between the two methods. fad <dig> and fad <dig> were up-regulated and fae <dig> down-regulated, consistent with the as <dig> acyl phenotype. pdat <dig> expression was up-regulated by ca 65% while pdat <dig> expression was up-regulated only 15%, reinforcing the dominant role of pdat <dig> in as <dig> tag biosynthesis. the expression of lpcat <dig> was up-regulated by 50-75%, while lpcat <dig> expression was not significantly affected. in vitro lpcat activity was enhanced by 75-125% in microsomal protein preparations from mid-developing as <dig> seed vs wt. co-incident homozygous knockout lines of dgat1/lpcat <dig> exhibited severe penalties on tag biosynthesis, delayed plant development and seed set, even with a functional pdat1; the double mutant dgat1/lpcat <dig> showed only marginally lower oil content than as <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, the data strongly support that in as <dig> it is lpcat <dig> up-regulation which is primarily responsible for assisting in pdat1-catalyzed tag biosynthesis, maintaining a supply of pc as co-substrate to transfer sn- <dig> moieties to the sn- <dig> position of the enlarged as <dig> dag pool.
