BACKGROUND
an intricate gene regulatory network drives neural crest migration and differentiation. how epigenetic regulators contribute to this process is just starting to be understood.


RESULTS
we found that mutation of med <dig> or brg <dig> in zebrafish embryos resulted in a cluster of neural crest cell-related defects. in med <dig> or brg <dig> mutants, neural crest cells that form the jaw skeleton were specified normally and migrated to target sites. however, defects in their subsequent terminal differentiation were evident. transplantation experiments demonstrated that med <dig> and brg <dig> are required directly in neural crest cells. analysis of med14; brg <dig> double mutant embryos suggested the existence of a strong genetic interaction between members of the mediator and baf complexes.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest a critical role for mediator and baf complex function in neural crest development, and may also clarify the nature of defects in some craniofacial abnormalities.
