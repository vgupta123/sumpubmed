BACKGROUND
in eutherian mammals, genomic imprinting is critical for normal placentation and embryo survival. insulin-like growth factor  <dig>  is imprinted in the placenta of both eutherians and marsupials, but its function, or that of any imprinted gene, has not been investigated in any marsupial. this study examines the role of igf <dig> in the yolk sac placenta of the tammar wallaby, macropus eugenii.


RESULTS
igf <dig> mrna and protein were produced in the marsupial placenta. both igf <dig> receptors were present in the placenta, and presumably mediate igf <dig> mitogenic actions. igf <dig> mrna levels were highest in the vascular region of the yolk sac placenta. igf <dig> increased vascular endothelial growth factor expression in placental explant cultures, suggesting that igf <dig> promotes vascularisation of the yolk sac.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first demonstration of a physiological role for any imprinted gene in marsupial placentation. the conserved imprinting of igf <dig> in this marsupial and in all eutherian species so far investigated, but not in monotremes, suggests that imprinting of this gene may have originated in the placenta of the therian ancestor.
