BACKGROUND
the t-box transcription factor tbx <dig> is necessary for early embryonic development and for the normal development of the mammary gland. homozygous mutations, in mice, are embryonic lethal while heterozygous mutations result in perturbed mammary gland development. in humans, mutations that result in the haploinsufficiency of tbx <dig> causes ulnar mammary syndrome  characterized by mammary gland hypoplasia as well as other congenital defects. in addition to its role in mammary gland development, various studies have also supported a role for tbx <dig> in breast cancer development. tbx <dig> is over-expressed in various breast cancer cell lines as well as cancer tissue and has been found to contribute to breast cancer cell migration. previous studies have suggested that tbx <dig> contributes to cancer development by its ability to bypass senescence by repressing the expression of p14arf-tumor suppressor. although many studies have shown that a dysregulation of tbx <dig> expression may contribute to cancer progression, no direct evidence shows tbx <dig> causes breast cancer.


RESULTS
in this study, we created doxycycline inducible double transgenic mice  to test whether tbx <dig> over-expression can induce tumor formation within the mammary gland. although over-expression of tbx <dig>  alone, did not induce tumor formation it did promote accelerated mammary gland development by increasing mammary epithelial cell proliferation. we also show that tbx <dig> directly binds to and represses nfκbib, an inhibitor of the nf-κb pathway known to play a role in regulating cell proliferation. lastly, we also show that the over-expression of tbx <dig> is associated with an increase in mammary stem-like cells.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, our data suggests that over-expression of tbx <dig> may contribute to breast cancer development by promoting accelerated mammary gland development through the inhibition of the nf-κb pathway and stimulation of both mammary epithelial cell and stem-like cell proliferation.
