BACKGROUND
in lymphocyte subsets, expression of cd <dig>  correlates with cytotoxic effector activity. for cells bearing the vγ2vδ <dig> t cell receptor, isoprenoid pyrophosphate stimulation leads to uniform activation and proliferation, but only a fraction of cells express cd <dig> and display potent cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. our goal was to show whether cd <dig> expression was regulated stochastically, similar to conventional activation antigens, or whether cd <dig> defined a lineage of cells committed to the cytotoxic phenotype.


RESULTS
tracking individual cell clones defined by their vγ <dig> chain cdr <dig> region sequences, we found that cd <dig> was expressed on precursor cytotoxic t cells already present in the population irrespective of their capacity to proliferate after antigen stimulation. public t cell receptor sequences found in the cd56+ subset from one individual might appear in the cd56- subset of another donor. the commitment of individual clones to cd56+ or cd56- lineages was stable for each donor over a  <dig> year interval.


CONCLUSIONS
the ability to express cd <dig> was not predicted by tcr sequence or by the strength of signal received by the tcr. for γδ t cells, cytotoxic effector function is acquired when cytotoxic precursors within the population are stimulated to proliferate and express cd <dig>  expression of cd <dig> defines a committed lineage to the cytotoxic phenotype.
