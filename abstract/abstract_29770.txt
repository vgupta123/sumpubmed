BACKGROUND
polar bears  are major predators in the arctic marine ecosystem, feeding mainly on seals, and living closely associated with sea ice. little is known of their gut microbial ecology and the main purpose of this study was to investigate the microbial diversity in faeces of polar bears in svalbard, norway . in addition the level of blatem alleles, encoding ampicillin resistance  were determined. in total, ten samples were collected from ten individual bears, rectum swabs from five individuals in  <dig> and faeces samples from five individuals in  <dig> 


RESULTS
a 16s rrna gene clone library was constructed, and all sequences obtained from  <dig> clones showed affiliation with the phylum firmicutes, with  <dig> sequences identified as clostridiales and one sequence identified as unclassified firmicutes. the majority of the sequences  were affiliated with the genus clostridium. aerobic heterotrophic cell counts on chocolate agar ranged between  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> colony forming units /ml for the rectum swabs and  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/g for the faeces samples. the proportion of ampr bacteria ranged from 0% to 44%. all of  <dig> randomly selected ampr isolates tested positive for enzymatic β-lactamase activity. three % of the ampr isolates from the rectal samples yielded positive results when screened for the presence of blatem genes by pcr. blatem alleles were also detected by pcr in two out of three total faecal dna samples from polar bears.


CONCLUSIONS
the bacterial diversity in faeces from polar bears in their natural environment in svalbard is low compared to other animal species, with all obtained clones affiliating to firmicutes. furthermore, only low levels of blatem alleles were detected in contrast to their increasing prevalence in some clinical and commensal bacterial populations.
