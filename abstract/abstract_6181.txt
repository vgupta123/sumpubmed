BACKGROUND
the objective was to determine the effects of agility exercise on dogs of different skill levels with respect to urinary eicosanoids, urinary 15f2t-isoprostane  and hematological/biochemical changes in plasma. fifteen adult dogs had blood and urine samples obtained prior to, immediately and 4-hours following an agility exercise.


RESULTS
hematocrit, red blood cells , albumin, and hemoglobin increased following exercise, with greatest increases correlating to increased skill group ; at 4-hours post-exercise, hematocrit, rbc, and hemoglobin were decreased. phosphorus increased following exercise with the greatest increase in novice and intermediates. plasma lactate increased  <dig> -fold in masters,  <dig> -fold in intermediates, and  <dig> -fold in novice dogs. urine thromboxane b <dig>  more than tripled 4-hours post-exercise while 6-keto prostaglandin f1α , prostaglandin e <dig> metabolites , and  <dig> -dihydro-15-keto prostaglandin f2α were unaffected as determined by a competitive enzyme immunoassay and standardized by division with urine creatinine. urine 15f2t-isoprostane increased insignificantly.


CONCLUSIONS
alterations in the plasma post-exercise were likely due to hemoconcentration from insensible water loss, splenic contraction and sympathetic stimulation while 4-hours later autohemodilution reduced rbc parameters. elevations in plasma lactate and urinary txb <dig> correlated with advanced skill level/speed of the dogs.
