BACKGROUND
s. erythraea is a gram-positive filamentous bacterium used for the industrial-scale production of erythromycin a which is of high clinical importance. in this work, we sequenced the whole genome of a high-producing strain  obtained by random mutagenesis and screening from the wild-type strain nrrl <dig>  and examined time-series expression profiles of both e <dig> and nrrl <dig>  based on the genomic data and transcriptpmic data of these two strains, we carried out comparative analysis of high-producing strain and wild-type strain at both the genomic level and the transcriptomic level.


RESULTS
we observed a large number of genetic variants including  <dig> insertions,  <dig> deletions and  <dig> single nucleotide variations  in e <dig> in comparison with nrrl <dig>  and the analysis of time series transcriptomic data indicated that the genes involved in erythromycin biosynthesis and feeder pathways were significantly up-regulated during the 60Â hours time-course. according to our data, bldd, a previously identified ery cluster regulator, did not show any positive correlations with the expression of ery cluster, suggesting the existence of alternative regulation mechanisms of erythromycin synthesis in s. erythraea. several potential regulators were then proposed by integration analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data.


CONCLUSIONS
this is a demonstration of the functional comparative genomics between an industrial s. erythraea strain and the wild-type strain. these findings help to understand the global regulation mechanisms of erythromycin biosynthesis in s. erythraea, providing useful clues for genetic and metabolic engineering in the future.
