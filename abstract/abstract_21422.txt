BACKGROUND
various evolutionary models have been proposed to interpret the fate of paralogous duplicates, which provides substrates on which evolution selection could act. in particular, domestication, as a special selection, has played important role in crop cultivation with divergence of many genes controlling important agronomic traits. recent studies have indicated that a pair of duplicate genes was often sub-functionalized from their ancestral functions held by the parental genes. we previously demonstrated that the rice cell-wall invertase  gene gif <dig> that plays an important role in the grain-filling process was most likely subjected to domestication selection in the promoter region. here, we report that gif <dig> and another cwi gene oscin <dig> constitute a pair of duplicate genes with differentiated expression and function through independent selection.


RESULTS
through synteny analysis, we show that gif <dig> and another cell-wall invertase gene oscin <dig> were paralogues derived from a segmental duplication originated during genome duplication of grasses. results based on analyses of population genetics and gene phylogenetic tree of  <dig> cultivars and  <dig> wild rice sequences demonstrated that oscin <dig> was also artificially selected during rice domestication with a fixed mutation in the coding region, in contrast to gif <dig> that was selected in the promoter region. gif <dig> and oscin <dig> have evolved into different expression patterns and probable different kinetics parameters of enzymatic activity with the latter displaying less enzymatic activity. overexpression of gif <dig> and oscin <dig> also resulted in different phenotypes, suggesting that oscin <dig> might regulate other unrecognized biological process.


CONCLUSIONS
how gene duplication and divergence contribute to genetic novelty and morphological adaptation has been an interesting issue to geneticists and biologists. our discovery that the duplicated pair of gif <dig> and oscin <dig> has experienced sub-functionalization implies that selection could act independently on each duplicate towards different functional specificity, which provides a vivid example for evolution of genetic novelties in a model crop. our results also further support the established hypothesis that gene duplication with sub-functionalization could be one solution for genetic adaptive conflict.
