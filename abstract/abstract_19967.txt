BACKGROUND
the ~ <dig> gb hexaploid bread wheat genome is a high priority and a major technical challenge for genomic studies. in particular, the d sub-genome is relatively lacking in genetic diversity, making it both difficult to map genetically, and a target for introgression of agriculturally useful traits. elucidating its sequence and structure will therefore facilitate wheat breeding and crop improvement.


RESULTS
we generated shotgun sequences from each arm of flow-sorted triticum aestivum chromosome 5d using  <dig> flx titanium technology, giving  <dig> × and  <dig> × coverage of the short  and long  arms of the chromosome respectively. by a combination of sequence similarity and assembly-based methods, ~74% of the sequence reads were classified as repetitive elements, and coding sequence models of  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were generated. the order of conserved genes in syntenic regions of previously sequenced grass genomes were integrated with physical and genetic map positions of  <dig> wheat markers to establish a virtual gene order for chromosome 5d.


CONCLUSIONS
the virtual gene order revealed a large-scale chromosomal rearrangement in the peri-centromeric region of 5dl, and a concentration of non-syntenic genes in the telomeric region of 5ds. although our data support the large-scale conservation of triticeae chromosome structure, they also suggest that some regions are evolving rapidly through frequent gene duplications and translocations.
