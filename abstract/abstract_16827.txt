BACKGROUND
procalcitonin  is a polypeptide with several cationic aminoacids in its chemical structure and it is a well known marker of sepsis. it is now emerging that pct might exhibit some anti-inflammatory effects. the present study, based on the evaluation of the in vitro interaction between pct and bacterial lipopolisaccharide , reports new data supporting the interesting and potentially useful anti-inflammatory activity of pct.


RESULTS
pct significantly decreased  the limulus amoebocyte lysate  assay reactivity of lps from both salmonella typhimurium  and escherichia coli . subsequently, the in vitro effects of pct on lps-induced cytokine release were studied in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells . when lps was pre-incubated for  <dig> minutes with different concentrations of pct, the release of interleukin- <dig>  and tumor necrosis factor alpha  by pbmc decreased in a concentration-dependent manner after  <dig> hours for il- <dig> and  <dig> hours for tnfÎ±. the release of monocyte chemotactic protein- <dig>  exhibited a drastic reduction at  <dig> hours for all the pct concentrations assessed, whereas such decrease was concentration-dependent after  <dig> hours.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides the first evidence of the capability of pct to directly neutralize bacterial lps, thus leading to a reduction of its major inflammatory mediators.
