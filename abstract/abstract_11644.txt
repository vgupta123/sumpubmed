BACKGROUND
blowflies have relevance in areas of forensic science, agriculture, and medicine, primarily due to the ability of their larvae to develop on flesh. while it is widely accepted that blowflies rely heavily on olfaction for identifying and locating hosts, there is limited research regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms. using next generation sequencing , this research examined the antennal transcriptome of calliphora stygia   to identify members of the major chemosensory gene families necessary for olfaction.


RESULTS
representative proteins from all chemosensory gene families essential in insect olfaction were identified in the antennae of the blowfly c. stygia, including  <dig> odorant receptors,  <dig> ionotropic receptors,  <dig> gustatory receptors,  <dig> odorant binding proteins,  <dig> chemosensory proteins, and  <dig> sensory neuron membrane proteins. a total of  <dig> candidate cytochrome p450s and  <dig> esterases, some of which may act as odorant degrading enzymes, were also identified. importantly, co-receptors necessary for the proper function of ligand-binding receptors were identified. putative orthologues for the conserved antennal ionotropic receptors and candidate gustatory receptors for carbon dioxide detection were also amongst the identified proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
this research provides a comprehensive novel resource that will be fundamental for future studies regarding blowfly olfaction. such information presents potential benefits to the forensic, pest control, and medical areas, and could assist in the understanding of insecticide resistance and targeted control through cross-species comparisons.
