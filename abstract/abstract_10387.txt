BACKGROUND
lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease afflicting more than  <dig> million people, while another  <dig>  billion people are at risk of infection. the nematode worm brugia malayi is one of the causative agents of the disease and exists in a mutualistic symbiosis with wolbachia bacteria. since extensive lateral gene transfer occurs frequently between wolbachia and its hosts, we sought to measure the extent of such lgt in b. malayi by whole genome sequencing of wolbachia-depleted worms.


RESULTS
a considerable fraction  of the  <dig> -mbp wolbachia wbm genome has been transferred to its nematode host and retains high levels of similarity, including  <dig> wbm genes and gene fragments. complete open reading frames were transferred for  <dig> of these genes, meaning they have the potential to produce functional proteins. moreover, four transfers have evidence of life stage-specific regulation of transcription at levels similar to other nematode transcripts, strengthening the possibility that they are functional.


CONCLUSIONS
there is extensive and ongoing transfer of wolbachia dna to the worm genome and some transfers are transcribed in a stage-specific manner at biologically relevant levels.
