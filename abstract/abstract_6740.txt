BACKGROUND
phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate  is a critically important regulatory phospholipid found in the plasma membrane of all eukaryotic cells. in addition to being a precursor of important second messengers, ptdinsp <dig> also regulates ion channels and transporters and serves the endocytic machinery by recruiting clathrin adaptor proteins. visualization of the localization and dynamic changes in ptdinsp <dig> levels in living cells is critical to understanding the biology of ptdinsp <dig>  this has been mostly achieved with the use of the pleckstrin homology  domain of plcδ <dig> fused to gfp. here we report on a comparative analysis of several recently-described yeast ph domains as well as the mammalian tubby domain to evaluate their usefulness as ptdinsp <dig> imaging tools.


RESULTS
all of the yeast ph domains that have been previously shown to bind ptdinsp <dig> showed plasma membrane localization but only a subset responded to manipulations of plasma membrane ptdinsp <dig>  none of these domains showed any advantage over the plcδ1ph-gfp reporter and were compromised either in their expression levels, nuclear localization or by causing peculiar membrane structures. in contrast, the tubby domain showed high membrane localization consistent with ptdinsp <dig> binding and displayed no affinity for the soluble headgroup, insp <dig>  detailed comparison of the tubby and plcδ1ph domains showed that the tubby domain has a higher affinity for membrane ptdinsp <dig> and therefore displays a lower sensitivity to report on changes of this lipid during phospholipase c activation.


CONCLUSIONS
these results showed that both the plcδ1ph-gfp and the gfp-tubby domain are useful reporters of ptdinsp <dig> changes in the plasma membrane, with distinct advantages and disadvantages. while the plcδ1ph-gfp is a more sensitive reporter, its insp <dig> binding may compromise its accuracy to measure ptdinsp2changes. the tubby domain is more accurate to report on ptdinsp <dig> but its higher affinity and lower sensitivity may limit its utility when phospholipase c activation is only moderate. these studies also demonstrated that similar changes in ptdinsp <dig> levels in the plasma membrane can differentially regulate multiple effectors if they display different affinities to ptdinsp <dig>
