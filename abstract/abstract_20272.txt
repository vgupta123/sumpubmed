BACKGROUND
the worldwide appearance of drug-resistant strains of h. pylori motivates a search for new agents with therapeutic potential against this family of bacteria that colonizes the stomach, and is associated with adenocarcinoma development. this study was designed to assess in vitro the anti-h. pylori potential of cathelicidin ll- <dig> peptide, which is naturally present in gastric juice, its optimized synthetic analog wlbu <dig>  and the non-peptide antibacterial agent ceragenin csa- <dig> 


RESULTS
in agreement with previous studies, increased expression of hcap-18/ll- <dig> was observed in gastric mucosa obtained from h. pylori infected subjects. mbc  values determined in nutrient-containing media range from 100- <dig> μg/ml for ll- <dig>   <dig> - <dig> μg/ml for wlbu <dig> and  <dig> - <dig>  μg/ml for ceragenin csa- <dig>  these data indicate substantial, but widely differing antibacterial activities against clinical isolates of h. pylori. after incubation in simulated gastric juice  csa- <dig>  but not ll- <dig> or wlbu <dig>  retained antibacterial activity. compared to ll- <dig> and wlbu <dig> peptides, csa- <dig> activity was also more resistant to inhibition by isolated host gastric mucins.


CONCLUSIONS
these data indicate that cholic acid-based antimicrobial agents such as csa- <dig> resist proteolytic degradation and inhibition by mucin and have potential for treatment of h. pylori infections, including those caused by the clarithromycin and/or metronidazole-resistant strains.
