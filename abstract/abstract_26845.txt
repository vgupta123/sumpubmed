BACKGROUND
repeated rehearsal is one method by which verbal material may be transferred from short- to long-term memory. we hypothesised that extended engagement of memory structures through prolonged rehearsal would result in enhanced efficacy of recall and also of brain structures implicated in new learning. twenty-four normal participants aged 55- <dig>  engaged in six weeks of rote learning, during which they learned  <dig> words per week every week . an extensive battery of memory tests was administered on three occasions, each six weeks apart. in addition, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy  was used to measure metabolite levels in seven voxels of interest   before and after learning.


RESULTS
results indicate a facilitation of new learning that was evident six weeks after rote learning ceased. this facilitation occurred for verbal/episodic material only, and was mirrored by a metabolic change in left posterior hippocampus, specifically an increase in naa/ ratio.


CONCLUSIONS
results suggest that repeated activation of memory structures facilitates anamnesis and may promote neuronal plasticity in the ageing brain, and that compliance is a key factor in such facilitation as the effect was confined to those who engaged fully with the training.
