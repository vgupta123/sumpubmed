BACKGROUND
pemphigus vulgaris  is an acquired autoimmune blistering disorder in which greater than 80% of active patients produce autoantibodies to the desmosomal protein desmogelin  <dig> . as the disease progresses, 40â€“50% of patients may also develop reactivity to a second component of the desmosomal complex, desmogelin  <dig> . t cells are clearly required for the production of autoantibodies in pv. however, few t-cell specificities within dsg <dig> or dsg <dig> have been reported to date, and the precise role of t-cells in disease pathogenesis and evolution remains poorly understood. in particular, no studies have addressed the immunological mechanisms that underlie the observed clinical heterogeneity in pemphigus. we report here a structure-based technique for the screening of drb1*0402-specific immunological  hotspots in both dsg <dig> and dsg <dig> glycoproteins.


RESULTS
high predictivity was obtained for drb1* <dig>  predictive model, compared to experimental data. in silico mapping of the t-cell epitope repertoires in dsg <dig> and dsg <dig> glycoproteins revealed that the potential immunological hotspots of both target autoantigens are highly conserved, despite limited sequence identity . a similar number of well-conserved  high-affinity binders were predicted to exist within both dsg <dig> and dsg <dig>  with analogous distribution of binding registers.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides interesting new insights into the possible mechanism for pv disease progression. our data suggests that the potential t-cell epitope repertoires encoded in dsg <dig> and dsg <dig> is substantially overlapping, and it may be possible to apply a common, antigen-specific therapeutic strategy with efficacy across distinct clinical phases of disease.
