BACKGROUND
the porcine circovirus-like agent p <dig> is a newly discovered dna virus with a single-stranded circular genome that is highly homologous to that of porcine circovirus type  <dig>  p <dig> infection can cause symptoms resembling postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome. this study aims to develop a rapid, sensitive and specific method to detect p <dig> 


RESULTS
a pair of primers was designed and used to amplify a 119 bp dna fragment to generate a recombinant plasmid which was served as the standard. a sybr i qpcr protocol was established using the p <dig> recombinant plasmid standard and the sensitivity, specificity and stability of this method was analyzed. the results demonstrate a strong correlation with p <dig> recombinant plasmid titers when virus dna copy numbers fall in between 100 ~  <dig> copies/μl. this method doesn’t detect pseudo rabies, porcine parvovirus or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus; moreover it can distinguish porcine circovirus type  <dig> from p <dig> by melting temperature analysis. coefficient of variation for each batch of reaction is less than 5 %. the serum virus titers of p <dig> positive in this study were measured by this protocol to be  <dig> to  <dig> copies/ml.


CONCLUSIONS
the established qpcr is sensitive, specific, and reliable, which could be a useful tool when applied to quantification of p <dig> in a variety of samples from infected pigs.
