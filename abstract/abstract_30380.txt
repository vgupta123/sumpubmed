BACKGROUND
chromosomal rearrangements in the form of deletions, insertions, inversions and translocations are frequently observed in breast cancer genomes, and a subset of these rearrangements may play a crucial role in tumorigenesis. to identify novel somatic chromosomal rearrangements, we determined the genome structures of  <dig> hormone-receptor negative breast tumors by long-insert mate pair massively parallel sequencing.


RESULTS
we identified and validated  <dig> somatic structural alterations, including the recurring fusion between genes ddx <dig> and ska <dig> and translocations involving the epha <dig> gene. other rearrangements were found to affect genes in pathways involved in epigenetic regulation, mitosis and signal transduction, underscoring their potential role in breast tumorigenesis. rna interference-mediated suppression of five candidate genes  led to inhibition of breast cancer cell growth. moreover, downregulation of ddx <dig> in breast cancer cells lead to an increased frequency of apoptotic nuclear morphology.


CONCLUSIONS
using whole genome mate pair sequencing and rna interference assays, we have discovered a number of novel gene rearrangements in breast cancer genomes and identified ddx <dig>  ska <dig>  epha <dig>  cltc and tnik as potential cancer genes with impact on the growth and proliferation of breast cancer cells.
