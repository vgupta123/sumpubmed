BACKGROUND
pfam is a comprehensive collection of protein domains and families, with a range of well-established information including genome annotation. pfam has two large series of functionally uncharacterized families, known as domains of unknown function  and uncharacterized protein families .


RESULTS
crystal structures of two proteins from deinococcus radiodurans and streptomyces coelicolor belonging to pfam protein family duf <dig>  have been determined using selenium-single-wavelength anomalous dispersion . based on the structure, we have identified the putative function for this family of protein.


CONCLUSIONS
unexpectedly, we found that duf <dig> pfam is remarkably similar to pfam family duf <dig> suggesting that the sequence-based classification alone may not be sufficient to classify proteins into pfam families.
