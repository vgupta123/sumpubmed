BACKGROUND
although analysis of micrornas  by dna microarrays is gaining in popularity, these new technologies have not been adequately validated. we examined within and between platform reproducibility of four mirna array technologies alongside taqman pcr arrays.


RESULTS
two distinct pools of reference materials were selected in order to maximize differences in mirna content. filtering for mirna that yielded signal above background revealed  <dig> mirna probes  across all platforms. using this probeset as well as all probes that were present on an individual platform, within-platform analyses revealed spearman correlations of > <dig>  for most platforms. comparing between platforms, rank analysis of the log ratios of the two reference pools also revealed high correlation . spearman rank correlation and concordance correlation coefficients for mirna arrays against taqman qrt-pcr arrays were similar for all of the technologies. platform performances were similar to those of previous cross-platform exercises on mrna and mirna microarray technologies.


CONCLUSIONS
these data indicate that mirna microarray platforms generated highly reproducible data and can be recommended for the study of changes in mirna expression.
