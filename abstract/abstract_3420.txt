BACKGROUND
new regulations by the swiss federal food safety and veterinary office provide for the monitoring of breed health by swiss breeding clubs. in collaboration with the swiss bernese mountain dog club, the purpose of this study was to investigate the causes of death in purebred dogs registered by the club and born in  <dig> and  <dig> 


RESULTS
of a total of  <dig> bernese mountain dogs  born in  <dig> and  <dig> in switzerland, data was collected from owners and veterinarians using a questionnaire designed for this study from  <dig> dogs . by the end of the study, 381/ <dig> dogs  had died. the median life expectancy of all dogs was  <dig>  years . female dogs had a significantly longer median survival  than male dogs  . the cause of death was unknown in 89/ <dig> dogs . for the remaining dogs, the most frequent causes of death were neoplasia , degenerative joint disease , spinal disorders , renal injury , and gastric or mesenteric volvulus . however, large numbers of dogs were diagnosed with neoplasia without histopathologic or cytologic confirmation. dogs with neoplasms had a shorter median survival than dogs with other disorders. the shortest median survival  was found for dogs with renal injury.


CONCLUSIONS
findings of this study confirm a high prevalence of neoplasia and associated low life expectancy in bmds. the results underline a need for more widespread precise diagnostics and further research on malignant tumours in this breed to improve overall breed health.
