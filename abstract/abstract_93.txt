BACKGROUND
affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry  is a widely used approach to identify protein interactions and complexes. in multicellular organisms, the accurate identification of protein complexes by ap/ms is complicated by the potential heterogeneity of complexes in different tissues. here, we present an in vivo biotinylation-based approach for the tissue-specific purification of protein complexes from caenorhabditis elegans. tissue-specific biotinylation is achieved by the expression in select tissues of the bacterial biotin ligase bira, which biotinylates proteins tagged with the avi peptide.


RESULTS
we generated n- and c-terminal tags combining gfp with the avi peptide sequence, as well as four bira driver lines expressing bira ubiquitously and specifically in the seam and hyp <dig> epidermal cells, intestine, or neurons. we validated the ability of our approach to identify bona fide protein interactions by identifying the known lgl- <dig> interaction partners par- <dig> and pkc- <dig>  purification of the discs large protein dlg- <dig> identified several candidate interaction partners, including the aaa-type atpase atad- <dig> and the uncharacterized protein maph- <dig> . we have identified the domains that mediate the dlg-1/atad- <dig> interaction, and show that this interaction contributes to c. elegans development. maph- <dig>  co-purified specifically with dlg- <dig> purified from neurons, and shared limited homology with the microtubule-associated protein map1a, a known neuronal interaction partner of mammalian dlg4/psd <dig>  a crispr/cas9-engineered gfp::maph- <dig>  fusion was broadly expressed and co-localized with microtubules.


CONCLUSIONS
the method we present here is able to purify protein complexes from specific tissues. we uncovered a series of dlg- <dig> interactors, and conclude that atad- <dig> is a biologically relevant interaction partner of dlg- <dig>  finally, we conclude that maph- <dig>  is a microtubule-associated protein of the map <dig> family and a candidate neuron-specific interaction partner of dlg- <dig>
