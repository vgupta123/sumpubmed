BACKGROUND
our purpose was to obtain genome-wide expression data for the rabbit species on the responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells  after in vitro stimulation by lipopolysaccharide  or phorbol myristate acetate  and ionomycin. this transcriptome profiling was carried out using microarrays enriched with immunity-related genes, and annotated with the most recent data available for the rabbit genome.


RESULTS
the lps affected  <dig> to  <dig> times fewer genes than pma-ionomycin after both 4 hours  and 24 hours , of in vitro stimulation, in comparison with mock-stimulated pbmcs. lps induced an inflammatory response as shown by a significant up-regulation of il12a and cxcl <dig> at t <dig>  followed by an increased transcription of il <dig>  il1b, il1a, il <dig>  il <dig>  tnf, and ccl <dig> at t <dig>  surprisingly, we could not find an up-regulation of il <dig> either at t <dig> or at t <dig>  and detected a down-regulation of defb <dig> and bpi at t <dig>  a concerted up-regulation of saa <dig>  s100a <dig> and f <dig> was found upon stimulation by lps.

pma-ionomycin induced a very early expression of th <dig>  th <dig>  treg, and th <dig> responses by pbmcs at t <dig>  the th <dig> response increased at t <dig> as shown by the increase of the transcription of ifng and by contrast to other cytokines which significantly decreased from t <dig> to t <dig>  by comparison to mock-stimulation. the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor  was by far the most over-expressed gene at both t <dig> and t <dig> by comparison to mock-stimulated cells, confirming a major impact of pma-ionomycin on cell growth and proliferation. a significant down-regulation of il <dig> was observed at t <dig> and t <dig>  in agreement with a role of il <dig> in pbmc apoptosis.


CONCLUSIONS
we report new data on the responses of pbmcs to lps and pma-ionomycin in the rabbit species, thus enlarging the set of mammalian species for which such reports exist. the availability of the rabbit genome assembly together with high throughput genomic tools should pave the way for more intense genomic studies for this species, which is known to be a very relevant biomedical model in immunology and physiology.
