BACKGROUND
the prediction of the secondary structure of a protein is a critical step in the prediction of its tertiary structure and, potentially, its function. moreover, the backbone dihedral angles, highly correlated with secondary structures, provide crucial information about the local three-dimensional structure.


RESULTS
we predict independently both the secondary structure and the backbone dihedral angles and combine the results in a loop to enhance each prediction reciprocally. support vector machines, a state-of-the-art supervised classification technique, achieve secondary structure predictive accuracy of 80% on a non-redundant set of  <dig> proteins, significantly higher than other methods on the same dataset. the dihedral angle space is divided into a number of regions using two unsupervised clustering techniques in order to predict the region in which a new residue belongs. the performance of our method is comparable to, and in some cases more accurate than, other multi-class dihedral prediction methods.


CONCLUSIONS
we have created an accurate predictor of backbone dihedral angles and secondary structure. our method, called disspred, is available online at http://comp.chem.nottingham.ac.uk/disspred/.
