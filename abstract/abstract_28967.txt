BACKGROUND
while there are many methods for predicting protein-protein interaction, very few can determine the specific site of interaction on each protein. characterization of the specific sequence regions mediating interaction  is crucial for an understanding of cellular pathways. experimental methods often report false binding sites due to experimental limitations, while computational methods tend to require data which is not available at the proteome-scale. here we present pipe-sites, a novel method of protein specific binding site prediction based on pairs of re-occurring polypeptide sequences, which have been previously shown to accurately predict protein-protein interactions. pipe-sites operates at high specificity and requires only the sequences of query proteins and a database of known binary interactions with no binding site data, making it applicable to binding site prediction at the proteome-scale.


RESULTS
pipe-sites was evaluated using a dataset of  <dig> yeast and  <dig> human interacting proteins pairs with experimentally-determined binding sites. we found that pipe-sites predictions were closer to the confirmed binding site than those of two existing binding site prediction methods based on domain-domain interactions, when applied to the same dataset. finally, we applied pipe-sites to two datasets of  <dig> yeast and  <dig>  human novel interacting protein pairs predicted to interact with high confidence. an analysis of the predicted interaction sites revealed a number of protein subsequences which are highly re-occurring in binding sites and which may represent novel binding motifs.


CONCLUSIONS
pipe-sites is an accurate method for predicting protein binding sites and is applicable to the proteome-scale. thus, pipe-sites could be useful for exhaustive analysis of protein binding patterns in whole proteomes as well as discovery of novel binding motifs. pipe-sites is available online at http://pipe-sites.cgmlab.org/.
