BACKGROUND
autophagy is a ubiquitous cellular process responsible for the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components through the autophagosomal-lysosomal pathway. in skeletal muscle, autophagy has been regarded as a key regulator for muscle mass maintenance, and its imbalance leads to sarcopenia. however, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood.


RESULTS
in this study, we demonstrate that cemtm <dig>  a fyve-domain containing myotubalarin family phosphatase, is required for the maintenance of muscle fibers by preventing excessive autophagy in caenorhabditis elegans. knockdown of cemtm <dig> by using feeding-based rna interference caused loss of muscle fibers accompanied by shortening of muscle cell and body size in aged c. elegans worms. this was preceded by the occurrence of excessive autophagy in the muscle and other tissues, which subsequently resulted in increased lysosomal activity and necrotic cell death. however, knockdown of cemtm <dig> did not aggravate the abnormalities of muscle wasting in autophagy-deficient atg- <dig> mutant worms.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest an important role of cemtm <dig> in regulating autophagy and maintaining muscle fibers. this study may have clinical implications for prevention and treatment of sarcopenia.
