BACKGROUND
enteropathogenic escherichia coli  produce attaching/effacing  lesions on eukaryotic cells mediated by the outer membrane adhesin intimin. epec are sub-grouped into typical  and atypical . we have recently demonstrated that aepec strain 1551- <dig>  invades hela cells by a process dependent on the expression of intimin sub-type omicron. in this study, we evaluated whether aepec strains expressing other intimin sub-types are also invasive using the quantitative gentamicin protection assay. we also evaluated whether aepec invade differentiated intestinal t <dig> cells.


RESULTS
five of six strains invaded hela and t <dig> cells in a range of  <dig> %– <dig> % and  <dig> %– <dig> %, respectively, of the total cell-associated bacteria. the strains studied were significantly more invasive than prototype tepec strain e2348/ <dig> . invasiveness was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. we also showed that invasion of hela cells by aepec 1551- <dig> depended on actin filaments, but not on microtubules. in addition, disruption of tight junctions enhanced its invasion efficiency in t <dig> cells, suggesting preferential invasion via a non-differentiated surface.


CONCLUSIONS
some aepec strains may invade intestinal cells in vitro with varying efficiencies and independently of the intimin sub-type.
