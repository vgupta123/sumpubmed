BACKGROUND
several hiv- <dig> circulating recombinant forms with a complex mosaic structure  circulate in central and western african regions. here we reconstruct the evolutionary history of some of these complex crfs  and further investigate the dissemination dynamic of the crf11_cpx clade by using a bayesian coalescent-based method.


RESULTS
the analysis of two hiv- <dig> datasets comprising  <dig> pol  and  <dig> env  sequences pointed to quite consistent onset dates for crf09_cpx , crf11_cpx  and crf13_cpx  clades; while some divergence was found for the estimated date of origin of crf45_cpx clade . phylogeographic reconstructions indicate that the hiv- <dig> crf11_cpx clade most probably emerged in cameroon and from there it was first disseminated to the central africa republic and chad in the early 1970s and to other central and western african countries from the early 1980s onwards. demographic reconstructions suggest that the crf11_cpx epidemic grew between  <dig> and  <dig> with a median exponential growth rate of  <dig>  year− <dig>  and stabilized after.


CONCLUSIONS
these results reveal that hiv- <dig> crfs_cpx clades have been circulating in central africa for a period comparable to other much more prevalent hiv- <dig> group m lineages. cameroon was probably the epicenter of dissemination of the crf11_cpx clade that seems to have experienced a long epidemic growth phase before stabilization. the epidemic growth of the crf11_cpx clade was roughly comparable to other hiv- <dig> group m lineages circulating in central africa.
