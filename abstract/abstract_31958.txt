BACKGROUND
avian influenza viruses may cause severe disease in a variety of domestic animal species worldwide, with high mortality in chickens and turkeys. to reduce the information gap about prevalence of these viruses in animals in uganda, this study was undertaken.


RESULTS
influenza a virus prevalence by rt-pcr was  <dig> %  while seroprevalence by elisa was  <dig> % . virus prevalence was highest in domestic ducks  and turkeys , followed by free-living waterfowl  and swine . a lower proportion of chicken samples  tested positive. no influenza a virus was isolated. a seasonal prevalence of these viruses in waterfowl was  <dig> %  for the dry and  <dig> %  for the wet season. in poultry, prevalence was  <dig> %  for the dry and  <dig> %  for the wet season, while that of swine was  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  in the two seasons, respectively. of the  <dig> rt-pcr positive samples,  <dig>  of them were h <dig> but none was h <dig>  the  <dig> swine sera positive for influenza antibodies by elisa were positive for h <dig> antibodies by hai assay, but the subtype of elisa positive poultry sera could not be determined. antibodies in the poultry sera could have been those against subtypes not included in the hai test panel.


CONCLUSIONS
the study has demonstrated occurrence of influenza a viruses in animals in uganda. the results suggest that increase in volumes of migratory waterfowl in the country could be associated with increased prevalence of these viruses in free-living waterfowl and poultry.
