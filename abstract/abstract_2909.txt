BACKGROUND
post-stroke hyperglycemia appears to be associated with poor outcome from stroke, greater mortality, and reduced functional recovery. focal cerebral ischemia data support that neural stem cells  play an important role in post-ischemic repair. here we sought to evaluate the negative effects of hyperglycemia on the cellular biology of nscs following anoxia, and to test whether high glucose affects nsc recovery from ischemic injury.


RESULTS
in this study, we used immortalized adult neural stem cells lines and we induced in vitro ischemia by 6 h oxygen and glucose deprivation  in an anaerobic incubator. reperfusion was performed by returning cells to normoxic conditions and the cells were then incubated in experimental medium with various concentrations of glucose  for 24 h. we found that high glucose  exposure induced apoptosis of nscs in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to ogd, using an annexin v/pi apoptosis detection kit. the cell viability and proliferative activity of nscs following ogd in vitro, evaluated with both a cell counting kit- <dig>  assay and a 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine  incorporation assay, were inhibited by high glucose exposure. cell cycle analysis showed that high glucose exposure increased the percentage of cells in g0/g1-phase, and reduced the percentage of cells in s-phase. furthermore, high glucose exposure was found to significantly induce the activation of c-jun n-terminal protein kinase  and p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase  and suppress extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/ <dig>  activity.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that high glucose induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation of nscs following ogd in vitro, which may be associated with the activation of jnk/p <dig> mapk pathways and the delay of g1-s transition in the cells.
