BACKGROUND
oligogalacturonic acids  are oligomers of alpha- <dig> -linked galacturonosyl residues that are released from cell walls by the hydrolysis of polygalacturonic acids upon fruit ripening and under abiotic/biotic stress. ogs may induce ethylene production and fruit ripening, however, the mechanism behind these processes is unknown.


RESULTS
tomato cultivar ‘ailsa craig’  and mutant neverripe, ripening inhibitor, non-ripening, and colorless non-ripening fruits were treated with ogs at different stages. only ac fruits at mature green stage  <dig> showed an advanced ripening phenomenon, although transient ethylene production was detected in all of the tomato fruits. ethylene synthesis genes leacs <dig> and leaco <dig> were rapidly up-regulated, and the phosphorylated leacs <dig> protein was detected after ogs treatment. protein kinase/phosphatase inhibitors significantly affected the ripening process induced by the ogs. as a potential receptor of ogs, lewakl <dig> was also up-regulated in their presence.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that ogs promoted tomato fruit ripening by inducing ethylene synthesis through the regulation of leacs <dig> at transcriptional and post-translational levels.
