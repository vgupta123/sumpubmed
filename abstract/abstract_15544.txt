BACKGROUND
cellular prion protein expression is essential for the development of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , and in sheep, genetic susceptibility to scrapie has been associated to prp gene polymorphisms. to test the hypothetical linkage between prp gene expression and genetic susceptibility, prp mrna levels were measured by real-time rt-pcr in six ovine tissues of animals with different genotypes.


RESULTS
previous to the prp gene expression analysis the stability of several housekeeping  genes was assessed in order to select the best ones for relative quantification. the normalisation of gene expression was carried out using a minimum of three hk genes in order to detect small expression differences more accurately than using a single control gene. the expression stability analysis of six hk genes showed a large tissue-associated variation reflecting the existence of tissue-specific factors. thereby, a specific set of hk genes was required for an accurate normalisation of the prp gene expression within each tissue. statistical differences in the normalised prp mrna levels were found among the tissues, obtaining the highest expression level in obex, followed by ileum, lymph node, spleen, cerebellum and cerebrum. a tendency towards increased prp mrna levels and genetic susceptibility was observed in central nervous system. however, the results did not support the hypothesis that prp mrna levels vary between genotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
the results on prp gene expression presented here provide valuable baseline data for future studies on scrapie pathogenesis. on the other hand, the results on stability data of several hk genes reported in this study could prove very useful in other gene expression studies carried out in these relevant ovine tissues.
