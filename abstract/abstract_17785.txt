BACKGROUND
the analysis of information in the biological domain is usually focused on the analysis of data from single on-line data sources. unfortunately, studying a biological process requires having access to disperse, heterogeneous, autonomous data sources. in this context, an analysis of the information is not possible without the integration of such data.

methods
ka-sb is a querying and analysis system for final users based on combining a data integration solution with a reasoner. thus, the tool has been created with a process divided into two steps: 1) komf, the khaos ontology-based mediator framework, is used to retrieve information from heterogeneous and distributed databases; 2) the integrated information is crystallized in a  reasoner . this information could be further analyzed later .


RESULTS
in this paper we present a novel system that combines the use of a mediation system with the reasoning capabilities of a large scale reasoner to provide a way of finding new knowledge and of analyzing the integrated information from different databases, which is retrieved as a set of ontology instances. this tool uses a graphical query interface to build user queries easily, which shows a graphical representation of the ontology and allows users o build queries by clicking on the ontology concepts.


CONCLUSIONS
these kinds of systems  will provide users with very large amounts of information , which cannot be managed using traditional main memory-based reasoners. we propose a process for creating persistent and scalable knowledgebases from sets of owl instances obtained by integrating heterogeneous data sources with komf. this process has been applied to develop a demo tool , which uses the biopax level  <dig> ontology as the integration schema, and integrates uniprot, kegg, chebi, brenda and sabiork databases.
