BACKGROUND
bone morphogenetic protein  <dig>  plays an important role in cancer pathogenesis. in breast cancer, it reduces proliferation and increases migration in a cell line-dependent manner. to characterize the transcriptional mediators of these phenotypes, we performed rna-seq and dnase-seq analyses after bmp <dig> treatment in mda-mb- <dig> and t-47d breast cancer cells that respond to bmp <dig> with enhanced migration and decreased cell growth, respectively.


RESULTS
the rna-seq data revealed gene expression changes that were consistent with the in vitro phenotypes of the cell lines, particularly in mda-mb- <dig>  where migration-related processes were enriched. these results were confirmed when enrichment of bmp4-induced open chromatin regions was analyzed. interestingly, the chromatin in transcription start sites of differentially expressed genes was already open in unstimulated cells, thus enabling rapid recruitment of transcription factors to the promoters as a response to stimulation. further analysis and functional validation identified mbd <dig>  cbfb, and hif1a as downstream regulators of bmp <dig> signaling. silencing of these transcription factors revealed that mbd <dig> was a consistent activator of target genes in both cell lines, cbfb an activator in cells with reduced proliferation phenotype, and hif1a a repressor in cells with induced migration phenotype.


CONCLUSIONS
integrating rna-seq and dnase-seq data showed that the phenotypic responses to bmp <dig> in breast cancer cell lines are reflected in transcriptomic and chromatin levels. we identified and experimentally validated downstream regulators of bmp <dig> signaling that relate to the different in vitro phenotypes and thus demonstrate that the downstream bmp <dig> response is regulated in a cell type-specific manner.
