BACKGROUND
pathogenesis-related proteins belonging to group  <dig>  are elevated in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. previously, we have shown a drastic salinity-induced increase in the levels of abr <dig>  a member of the pr <dig> family, in pea. furthermore, we have also demonstrated that the constitutive expression of pea abr <dig> cdna in arabidopsis thaliana and brassica napus enhances their germination and early seedling growth under stress. although it has been reported that several members of the pr <dig> family including abr <dig> possess rnase activity, the exact mechanism by which the aforementioned characteristics are conferred by abr <dig> is unknown at this time. we hypothesized that a study of differences in transcriptome between wild type  and abr <dig> transgenic a. thaliana may shed light on this process.


RESULTS
the molecular changes brought about by the expression of pea abr <dig> cdna in a. thaliana in the presence or absence of salt stress were investigated using microarrays consisting of 70-mer oligonucleotide probes representing  <dig>  arabidopsis genes. statistical analysis identified number of genes which were over represented among up- or down-regulated transcripts in the transgenic line. our results highlight the important roles of many abscisic acid  and cytokinin  responsive genes in abr <dig> transgenic lines. although the transcriptional changes followed a general salt response theme in both wt and transgenic seedlings under salt stress, many genes exhibited differential expression patterns when the transgenic and wt lines were compared. these genes include plant defensins, heat shock proteins, other defense related genes, and several transcriptional factors. our microarray results for selected genes were validated using quantitative real-time pcr.


CONCLUSIONS
transcriptional analysis in abr <dig> transgenic arabidopsis plants, both under normal and saline conditions, revealed significant changes in abundance of transcripts for many stress responsive genes, as well as those related to plant growth and development. our results also suggest that abr <dig> may mediate stress tolerance through the modulation of many aba- and ck-responsive genes and may further our understanding of the role of abr <dig> in mediating plant stress responses.
