BACKGROUND
current literature suggests that dipeptidyl peptidase iv  plays an essential role in t-dependent immune responses, a role that could have important clinical consequences. to rigorously define the role of dpp-iv in the immune system, we evaluated genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme on t-dependent immune responses in vivo.


RESULTS
the dpp-iv null animals mounted robust primary and secondary antibody responses to the t dependent antigens, 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl-ovalbumin  and 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl-chicken gamma globulin , which were comparable to wild type mice. serum levels of antigen specific igm, igg <dig>  igg2a, igg2b and igg <dig> were similar between the two groups of animals. dpp-iv null animals mounted an efficient germinal center reaction by day  <dig> after antigen stimulation that was comparable to wild type mice. moreover, the antibodies produced by dpp-iv null animals after repeated antigenic challenge were affinity matured. similar observations were made using wild type animals treated with a highly selective dpp-iv inhibitor during the entire course of the experiments. t cell recall responses to ovalbumin and mog peptide, evaluated by measuring proliferation and il- <dig> release from cells isolated from draining lymph nodes, were equivalent in dpp-iv null and wild type animals. furthermore, mice treated with dpp-iv inhibitor had intact t-cell recall responses to mog peptide. in addition, female dpp-iv null and wild type mice treated with dpp-iv inhibitor exhibited normal and robust in vivo cytotoxic t cell responses after challenge with cells expressing the male h-y minor histocompatibility antigen.


CONCLUSIONS
these data indicate selective inhibition of dpp-iv does not impair t dependent immune responses to antigenic challenge.
