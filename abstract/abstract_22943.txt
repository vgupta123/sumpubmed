BACKGROUND
simpler biological systems should be easier to understand and to engineer towards pre-defined goals. one way to achieve biological simplicity is through genome minimization. here we looked for genomic islands in the fresh water cyanobacteria synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig>  that could be used as targets for deletion. we also looked for conserved genes that might be essential for cell survival.


RESULTS
by using a combination of methods we identified  <dig> xenologs,  <dig> orfans and  <dig> core genes in the genome of s. elongatus pcc  <dig>  these represent  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the annotated genes respectively. we considered that genes in genomic islands could be found if they showed a combination of: a) unusual g+c content; b) unusual phylogenetic similarity; and/or c) a small number of the highly iterated palindrome  <dig>  motif plus an unusual codon usage. the origin of the largest genomic island by horizontal gene transfer  could be corroborated by lack of coverage among metagenomic sequences from a fresh water microbialite. evidence is also presented that xenologous genes tend to cluster in operons. interestingly, most genes coding for proteins with a diguanylate cyclase domain are predicted to be xenologs, suggesting a role for horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of synechococcus sensory systems.


CONCLUSIONS
our estimates of genomic islands in pcc  <dig> are larger than those predicted by other published methods like sigi-hmm. our results set a guide to non-essential genes in s. elongatus pcc  <dig> indicating a path towards the engineering of a model photoautotrophic bacterial cell.
