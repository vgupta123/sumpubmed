BACKGROUND
computational models of protein structures were proved to be useful as search models in molecular replacement , a common method to solve the phase problem faced by macromolecular crystallography. the success of mr depends on the accuracy of a search model. unfortunately, this parameter remains unknown until the final structure of the target protein is determined. during the last few years, several model quality assessment programs  that predict the local accuracy of theoretical models have been developed. in this article, we analyze whether the application of mqaps improves the utility of theoretical models in mr.


RESULTS
for our dataset of  <dig> search models, the real local accuracy of a model increases the mr success ratio by 101% compared to corresponding polyalanine templates. on the contrary, when local model quality is not utilized in mr, the computational models solved only  <dig> % more mr searches than polyalanine templates. for the same dataset of the  <dig> models, a workflow combining mr with predicted local accuracy of a model found 45% more correct solution than polyalanine templates. to predict such accuracy metamqapclust, a “clustering mqap” was used.


CONCLUSIONS
using comparative models only marginally increases the mr success ratio in comparison to polyalanine structures of templates. however, the situation changes dramatically once comparative models are used together with their predicted local accuracy. a new functionality was added to the genesilico fold prediction metaserver in order to build models that are more useful for mr searches. additionally, we have developed a simple method, amigomr , to predict if an mr search with a template-based model for a given template is likely to find the correct solution.
