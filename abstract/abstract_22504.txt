BACKGROUND
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  has become one of the most prevalent pathogens responsible for nosocomial infections throughout the world. as clinical mrsa diagnosis is concerned, current diagnostic methodologies are restricted by significant drawbacks and novel methods are required for mrsa detection. this study aimed at developing a simple loop-mediated isothermal amplification  assay targeting on orfx for the rapid detection of methicillin-resistance staphylococcus aureus .


RESULTS
the protocol was designed by targeting orfx, a highly conserved open reading frame in s. aureus. one hundred and sixteen reference strains, including  <dig> gram-positive and  <dig> gram-negative isolates, were included for evaluation and optimization of the orfx-lamp assay. this assay had been further performed on  <dig> staphylococcus  strains and were comparatively validated by pcr assay using primers f <dig> and b <dig>  with rapid template dna processing, simple equipments  and direct result determination  applied. the indispensability of each primer had been confirmed, and the optimal amplification was obtained under 65°c for 45 min. the 25 μl reactant was found to be the most cost-efficient volume, and the detection limit was determined to be  <dig> dna copies and 10 cfu/reaction. high specificity was observed when orfx-lamp assay was subjected to  <dig> reference strains. for application,  <dig>  and  <dig>  tested strains had been detected positive by lamp and pcr assays. the detection rate, positive predictive value  and negative predictive value  of orfx-lamp were  <dig> %, 100% and  <dig> % respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the established orfx-lamp assay had been demonstrated to be a valid and rapid detection method on mrsa.
