BACKGROUND
intestinal mucus production by hyperplasic goblet cells is a striking pathological feature of many parasitic helminth infections and is related to intestinal protection and worm expulsion. induction of goblet cell hyperplasia is associated with th <dig> immune responses, which in helminth infections are controlled primarily by il- <dig>  and also il- <dig>  in the study presented here we examine the goblet cell hyperplasic response to three experimental parasitic helminth infections; namely nippostrongylus brasiliensis, syphacia obvelata and schistosoma mansoni.


RESULTS
as expected n. brasiliensis infection induced a strong goblet cell hyperplasia dependent on il-4/il-13/il-4rα expression. in contrast, and despite previously published transiently elevated il-4/il- <dig> levels, s. obvelata infections did not increase goblet cell hyperplasia in the colon. furthermore, induction of goblet cell hyperplasia in response to s. mansoni eggs traversing the intestine was equivalent between balb/c, il-4/il-13-/- and il-4rα-/- mice.


CONCLUSIONS
together these data demonstrate that intestinal goblet cell hyperplasia can be independent of th <dig> immune responses associated with parasitic helminth infections.
