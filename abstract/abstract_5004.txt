BACKGROUND
most cytokines signal through heteromeric receptor complexes consisting of two or more different receptor subunits. fusion proteins of the extracellular parts of receptor subunits turned out to be promising cytokine inhibitors useful in anti-cytokine therapy and cytokine research.


RESULTS
we constructed receptor fusion proteins  consisting of the ligand binding domains of the murine oncostatin m  receptor subunits mosmr and mgp <dig> connected by a flexible linker as potential mosm inhibitors. mgp <dig> is a shared cytokine receptor that is also used by other cytokines such as il- <dig> and leukemia inhibitory factor . in this study we compare four types of mosm-rfps that contain either domains d1-d <dig> or domains d2-d <dig> of mgp <dig> and are arranged in two ways. domain d <dig> of mgp <dig> turned out to be dispensable for mosm-binding. however, the arrangement of the two receptor subunits is essential for the inhibitory activity. we found mosm induced stat <dig> phosphorylation to be suppressed only when the mosmr fragment was fused in front of the mgp <dig> fragment.


CONCLUSIONS
mosm-rfp consisting of d1-d <dig> of mosmr and d2-d <dig> of mgp <dig> is a highly potent and specific inhibitor of mosm. since mosm-rfp is encoded by a single gene it offers numerous possibilities for specific cytokine inhibition in gene delivery approaches based on viral vectors, transgenic animals and finally gene therapy.
