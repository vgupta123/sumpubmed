BACKGROUND
causal networks based on the vector autoregressive  process are a promising statistical tool for modeling regulatory interactions in a cell. however, learning these networks is challenging due to the low sample size and high dimensionality of genomic data.


RESULTS
we present a novel and highly efficient approach to estimate a var network. this proceeds in two steps:  improved estimation of var regression coefficients using an analytic shrinkage approach, and  subsequent model selection by testing the associated partial correlations. in simulations this approach outperformed for small sample size all other considered approaches in terms of true discovery rate . moreover, the analysis of expression time series data from arabidopsis thaliana resulted in a biologically sensible network.


CONCLUSIONS
statistical learning of large-scale var causal models can be done efficiently by the proposed procedure, even in the difficult data situations prevalent in genomics and proteomics.

availability
the method is implemented in r code that is available from the authors on request.
