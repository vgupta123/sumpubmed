BACKGROUND
heparin cofactor ii  is a circulating protease inhibitor, one which contains an n-terminal acidic extension  unique within the serpin superfamily. deletion of hcii 1- <dig> greatly reduces the ability of glycosaminoglycans  to accelerate the inhibition of thrombin, and abrogates hcii binding to thrombin exosite  <dig>  while a minor portion of hcii 1- <dig> can be visualized in a crystallized hcii-thrombin s195a complex, the role of the rest of the extension is not well understood and the affinity of the hcii 1- <dig> interaction has not been quantitatively characterized. to address these issues, we expressed hcii 1- <dig> as a small, n-terminally hexahistidine-tagged polypeptide in e. coli.


RESULTS
immobilized purified hcii 1- <dig> bound active α-thrombin and active-site inhibited fpr-ck- or s195a-thrombin, but not exosite-1-disrupted γt-thrombin, in microtiter plate assays. biotinylated hcii 1- <dig> immobilized on streptavidin chips bound α-thrombin and fpr-ck-thrombin with similar kd values of 330- <dig> nm. hcii 1- <dig> competed thrombin binding to chip-immobilized hcii 1- <dig> more effectively than hcii 54- <dig> but less effectively than the c-terminal dodecapeptide of hirudin . this superiority over hcii 54- <dig> was also demonstrated in plasma clotting assays and in competing the heparin-catalysed inhibition of thrombin by plasma-derived hcii; hcii 1- <dig> had no effect in either assay. molecular modelling of hcii 1- <dig> correctly predicted those portions of the acidic extension that had been previously visualized in crystal structures, and suggested that an α-helix found between residues  <dig> and  <dig> stabilizes one found between residues 61- <dig>  the latter region has been previously shown by deletion mutagenesis and crystallography to play a crucial role in the binding of hcii to thrombin exosite  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
assuming that the kd value for hcii 1- <dig> of 330- <dig> nm faithfully predicts that of this region in intact hcii, and that 1- <dig> binding to exosite  <dig> is gag-dependent, our results support a model in which thrombin first binds to gags, followed by hcii addition to the ternary complex and release of hcii 1- <dig> for exosite  <dig> binding and serpin mechanism inhibition. they further suggest that, in isolated or transferred form, the entire hcii 1- <dig> region is required to ensure maximal binding of thrombin exosite  <dig>
