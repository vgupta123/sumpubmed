BACKGROUND
immunization with the spike protein  of severe acute respiratory syndrome -coronavirus  in mice is known to produce neutralizing antibodies and to prevent the infection caused by sars-cov. polyethylenimine 25k  is a cationic polymer which effectively delivers the plasmid dna.


RESULTS
in the present study, the immune responses of balb/c mice immunized via intranasal  route with sars dna vaccine  in a pei/pci-s complex form have been examined. the size of the pei/pci-s nanoparticles appeared to be around  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm, and the expression of the s mrna and protein was confirmed in vitro. the mice immunized with i.n. pei/pci-s nanoparticles produced significantly  higher s-specific igg <dig> in the sera and mucosal secretory iga in the lung wash than those in mice treated with pci-s alone. compared to those in mice challenged with pci-s alone, the number of b220+ cells found in pei/pci-s vaccinated mice was elevated. co-stimulatory molecules  and class ii major histocompatibility complex molecules  were increased on cd11c+ dendritic cells in cervical lymph node from the mice after pei/pci-s vaccination. the percentage of ifn-γ-, tnf-α- and il-2-producing cells were higher in pei/pci-s vaccinated mice than in control mice.


CONCLUSIONS
these results showed that intranasal immunization with pei/pci-s nanoparticles induce antigen specific humoral and cellular immune responses.
