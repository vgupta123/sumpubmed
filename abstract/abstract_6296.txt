BACKGROUND
the continuous polarized vesicle secretion in pollen tubes is essential for tip growth but the location of endo- and exocytic sub-domains remains however controversial. in this report we aimed to show that arabidopsis thaliana syntaxins are involved in this process and contribute to spatially define exocytosis and membrane recycling.


RESULTS
using gfp-fusion constructs, we imaged the distribution of pollen-specific  and non-pollen syntaxins  in transiently transformed nicotiana tabacum pollen tubes. all three proteins associate with the plasma membrane and with apical vesicles indicating a conserved action mechanism for all syps. however, the gfp tagged syp <dig> showed a specific distribution with a higher labelling at the plasma membrane flanks, 10- <dig> Î¼m behind the apex. this distribution is affected by ca2+ fluxes as revealed by treatment with gd3+  and tmb- <dig> . both inhibitors decreased growth rate but the distribution of syp <dig> at the plasma membrane was more strongly affected by gd3+. competition with a related dominant negative mutant affected the specific distribution of syp <dig> but not tip growth. in contrast, co-expression of the phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate 5-kinase  <dig>  or of the small gtpase rab <dig> perturbed polarity and the normal distribution of gfp-syp but did not inhibit the accumulation in vesicles or at the plasma membrane.


CONCLUSIONS
the results presented suggest that in normal growing pollen tubes, a net exocytic flow occurs in the flanks of the tube apex mediated by syp <dig>  the specific distribution of syp <dig> at the plasma membrane is affected by changes in ca2+ levels in agreement with the importance of this ion for exocytosis. apical growth and the specific localization of syp <dig> were affected by regulators of membrane secretion  but competition with a dominant negative mutant affected only syp distribution. these data thus suggest that syntaxins alone do not provide the level of specificity that is required for apical growth and that additional signalling and functional mechanisms are required.
