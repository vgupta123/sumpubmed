BACKGROUND
nuclear myosin 1c  is emerging as a regulator of transcription and chromatin organization.


RESULTS
using chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing  in combination with molecular analyses, we investigated the global association of nm <dig> with the mammalian genome. analysis of the chip-seq data demonstrates that nm <dig> binds across the entire mammalian genome with occupancy peaks correlating with distributions of rna polymerase ii  and active epigenetic marks at class ii gene promoters. in mouse embryonic fibroblasts subjected to rnai mediated nm <dig> gene silencing, we show that nm <dig> synergizes with polymerase-associated actin to maintain active pol ii at the promoter. nm <dig> also co-localizes with the nucleosome remodeler snf2h at class ii promoters where they assemble together with wstf as part of the b-wich complex. a high resolution micrococcal nuclease  assay and quantitative real time pcr shows that this mechanism is required for local chromatin remodeling. following b-wich assembly, nm <dig> mediates physical recruitment of the histone acetyl transferase pcaf and the histone methyl transferase set1/ash <dig> to maintain and preserve h3k9acetylation and h3k4trimethylation for active transcription.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose a novel genome-wide mechanism where myosin synergizes with pol ii-associated actin to link the polymerase machinery with permissive chromatin for transcription activation.
