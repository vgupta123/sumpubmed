BACKGROUND
cell population control allows for the maintenance of a specific cell population density. in this study, we use lysis gene bba_k <dig> from the registry of standard biological parts, formed by mit, to lyse escherichia coli . the lysis gene is regulated by a synthetic genetic lysis circuit, using an inducer-regulated promoter-rbs component. to make the design more easily, it is necessary to provide a systematic approach for a genetic lysis circuit to achieve control of cell population density.


RESULTS
firstly, the lytic ability of the constructed genetic lysis circuit is described by the relationship between the promoter-rbs components and inducer concentration in a steady state model. then, three types of promoter-rbs libraries are established. finally, according to design specifications, a systematic design approach is proposed to provide synthetic biologists with a prescribed i/o response by selecting proper promoter-rbs component set in combination with suitable inducer concentrations, within a feasible range.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides an important systematic design method for the development of next-generation synthetic gene circuits, from component library construction to genetic circuit assembly. in future, when libraries are more complete, more precise cell density control can be achieved.
