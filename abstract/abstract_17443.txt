BACKGROUND
the cattle ticks, boophilus spp., affect cattle production in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. tick vaccines constitute a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to tick control. the recombinant b. microplus bm <dig> protective antigen has been shown to protect cattle against tick infestations. recently, the gene coding for b. annulatus bm <dig> ortholog, ba <dig>  was cloned and the recombinant protein was secreted and purified from the yeast pichia pastoris.


RESULTS
recombinant ba <dig>  was used to immunize cattle to test its efficacy for the control of b. annulatus  and b. microplus  infestations. bm <dig>  and adjuvant/saline were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. vaccination with ba <dig> reduced tick infestations , weight , oviposition  and egg fertility  for b. annulatus and b. microplus, respectively. the efficacy of both ba <dig> and bm <dig> was higher for b. annulatus than for b. microplus. the efficacy of ba <dig> was higher for b. annulatus  than for b. microplus . the efficacy of bm <dig>  but not bm <dig>  was higher than that of ba <dig>  on b. microplus. however, the efficacy of bm <dig>  was higher than that of ba <dig>  on b. annulatus.


CONCLUSIONS
these experiments showed the efficacy of recombinant ba <dig> for the control of b. annulatus and b. microplus infestations in cattle and suggested that physiological differences between b. microplus and b. annulatus and those encoded in the sequence of bm <dig> orthologs may be responsible for the differences in susceptibility of these tick species to bm <dig> vaccines.
