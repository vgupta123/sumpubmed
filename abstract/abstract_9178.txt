BACKGROUND
micrornas  are ~ <dig> nt long integral elements responsible for post-transcriptional control of gene expressions. after the identification of thousands of mirnas, the challenge is now to explore their specific biological functions. to this end, it will be greatly helpful to construct a reasonable organization of these mirnas according to their homologous relationships. given an established mirna family system , this paper addresses the problem of automatically and accurately classifying newly found mirnas to their corresponding families by supervised learning techniques. concretely, we propose an effective method, mirfam, which uses only primary information of pre-mirnas or mature mirnas and a multiclass svm, to automatically classify mirna genes.


RESULTS
an existing mirna family system prepared by mirbase was downloaded online. we first employed n-grams to extract features from known precursor sequences, and then trained a multiclass svm classifier to classify new mirnas . comparing with mirbase's sequence alignment and manual modification, our study shows that the application of machine learning techniques to mirna family classification is a general and more effective approach. when the testing dataset contains more than  <dig> families , the classification accuracy is around 98%. even with the entire mirbase <dig> , the accuracy surprisingly reaches 90%.


CONCLUSIONS
based on experimental results, we argue that mirfam is suitable for application as an automated method of family classification, and it is an important supplementary tool to the existing alignment-based small non-coding rna  classification methods, since it only requires primary sequence information.
