BACKGROUND
the myb superfamily is one of the most abundant transcription factor  families in plants. myb proteins include highly conserved n-terminal myb repeats  and various c-terminal sequences that confer extensive functions. however, the functions of most myb genes are unknown, and have been little studied in chinese cabbage.


RESULTS
here, we analyzed  <dig>  r2r3-myb genes from chinese cabbage  and anchored them onto the  <dig> chromosomes and three subgenomes. the r2r3-, 3r- and atypical myb proteins in chinese cabbage formed  <dig> subgroups based on domain similarity and phylogenetic topology. organization and syntenic analysis revealed the genomic distribution and collinear relationships of the r2r3-brmybs. synonymous nucleotide substitution  analysis showed that the chinese cabbage myb dna-binding domain is under strong purifying selection. moreover, rna-seq data revealed tissue-specific and distinct r2r3-brmyb expression profiles, and quantitative real-time pcr  analysis in leaves showed stress responsive expression and crosstalk with aba-auxin signaling cascades.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified the largest myb gene family in plants to date. our results indicate that members of this superfamily may be involved in plant development, stress responses and leaf senescence, highlighting their functional diversity.
