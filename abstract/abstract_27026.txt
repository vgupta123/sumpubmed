BACKGROUND
iron regulatory protein  <dig> , a post-transcriptional regulator of cellular iron metabolism, undergoes iron-dependent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. a stretch of  <dig> amino acids within the n-terminal domain  <dig> of the protein was reported to function as an iron sensor. however, mutants lacking this fragment remain sensitive to degradation in iron-replete cells.


RESULTS
to identify elements within irp <dig> involved in the control of its stability, we undertook a systematic mutagenesis approach. truncated versions of irp <dig> were expressed in h <dig> cells and analyzed for their response to iron. deletion mutants lacking the entire c-terminal domain  <dig>  of irp <dig> remained stable following iron treatments. moreover, the replacement of domain  <dig> of irp <dig> with the corresponding region of irp <dig> sensitized the chimerical irp11–3/irp <dig> protein to iron-dependent degradation, while the reverse manipulation gave rise to a stable chimerical irp21–3/irp <dig> protein. the deletion of just  <dig> or  <dig> c-terminal amino acids stabilized irp <dig> against iron. however, the fusion of c-terminal irp <dig> fragments to luciferase failed to sensitize the indicator protein for degradation in iron-loaded cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that the c-terminus of irp <dig> contains elements that are necessary but not sufficient for iron-dependent degradation. the functionality of these elements depends upon the overall irp structure.
