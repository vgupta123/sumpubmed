BACKGROUND
microarray technology has unveiled transcriptomic differences among tumors of various phenotypes, and, especially, brought great progress in molecular understanding of phenotypic diversity of breast tumors. however, compared with the massive knowledge about the transcriptome, we have surprisingly little knowledge about regulatory mechanisms underling transcriptomic diversity.


RESULTS
to gain insights into the transcriptional programs that drive tumor progression, we integrated regulatory sequence data and expression profiles of breast cancer into a bayesian network, and searched for cis-regulatory motifs statistically associated with given histological grades and prognosis. our analysis found that motifs bound by elk <dig>  e2f, nrf <dig> and nfy are potential regulatory motifs that positively correlate with malignant progression of breast cancer.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that these  <dig> motifs are principal regulatory motifs driving malignant progression of breast cancer. our method offers a more concise description about transcriptome diversity among breast tumors with different clinical phenotypes.
