BACKGROUND
chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacteria comprising some of the most important bacterial pathogens of animals and humans. although chlamydial outer membrane proteins play a key role for attachment to and entry into host cells, only few have been described so far. we developed a comprehensive, multiphasic in silico approach, including the calculation of clusters of orthologues, to predict outer membrane proteins using conservative criteria. we tested this approach using escherichia coli  and bacillus subtilis , and applied it to five chlamydial species; chlamydia trachomatis, chlamydia muridarum, chlamydia  pneumoniae, chlamydia  caviae, and protochlamydia amoebophila.


RESULTS
in total,  <dig> chlamydial outer membrane proteins and lipoproteins in  <dig> orthologous clusters were identified, including  <dig> proteins not previously recognized to be located in the outer membrane. analysis of their taxonomic distribution revealed an evolutionary conservation among chlamydiae, verrucomicrobia, lentisphaerae and planctomycetes as well as lifestyle-dependent conservation of the chlamydial outer membrane protein composition.


CONCLUSIONS
this analysis suggested a correlation between the outer membrane protein composition and the host range of chlamydiae and revealed a common set of outer membrane proteins shared by these intracellular bacteria. the collection of predicted chlamydial outer membrane proteins is available at the online database pcomp http://www.microbial-ecology.net/pcomp and might provide future guidance in the quest for anti-chlamydial vaccines.
