BACKGROUND
auxin plays a critical role in inducing adventitious rooting in many plants. indole-3-butyric acid  is the most widely employed auxin for adventitious rooting. however, the molecular mechanisms by which auxin regulate the process of adventitious rooting are less well known.


RESULTS
the rna-seq data analysis indicated that iba treatment greatly increased the amount of clean reads and the amount of expressed unigenes by  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % and by  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % at two time points, respectively, and significantly increased the numbers of unigenes numbered with rpkm = 10- <dig> and rpkm = 500- <dig> by  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % and by  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % at two time points, respectively. gene ontology  enrichment analysis indicated that the enrichment of down-regulated gos was  <dig> -fold higher than that of up-regulated gos at stage  <dig>  suggesting that iba significantly down-regulated gene expression at 6 h. the go functional category indicated that iba significantly up- or down-regulated processes associated with auxin signaling, ribosome assembly and protein synthesis, photosynthesis, oxidoreductase activity and extracellular region, secondary cell wall biogenesis, and the cell wall during the development process. kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway enrichment indicated that ribosome biogenesis, plant hormone signal transduction, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, photosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis, ribosome, cutin, flavonoid biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism were the pathways most highly regulated by iba. a total of  <dig> differentially expressed  unigenes  with  <dig>  that were up-regulated and  <dig>  down-regulated,  <dig> unigenes with  <dig>  that were up-regulated and  <dig>  down-regulated, and  <dig> unigenes with  <dig>  that were up-regulated and  <dig>  down-regulated were detected at stage  <dig>  stage  <dig>  and between stage  <dig> and stage  <dig>  respectively, suggesting that iba treatment increased the number of degs. a total of  <dig> degs specifically involved in plant hormone signaling and  <dig> transcription factor  genes were also regulated by iba. qrt-pcr validation of the  <dig> genes with known functions indicated a strong correlation with the rna-seq data.


CONCLUSIONS
the changes in go functional categories, kegg pathways, and global deg profiling during adventitious rooting induced by iba were analyzed. these results provide valuable information about the molecular traits of iba regulation of adventitious rooting.
