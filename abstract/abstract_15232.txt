BACKGROUND
the spread of mrsa strains at hospitals as well as in the community are of great concern worldwide. we characterized the mrsa clones isolated at tunisian hospitals and in the community by comparing them to those isolated in other countries.


RESULTS
we characterized  <dig> mrsa strains isolated from two tunisian university hospitals between the years 2004- <dig>  twenty-two of  <dig>  community-associated mrsa  strains and  <dig> of  <dig>  healthcare-associated mrsa  strains were pvl-positive. the pvl-positive strains belonged to predicted founder group   <dig> in mlst and carried either type ivc sccmec or nontypeable sccmec that harbours the class b mec gene complex. in contrast, very diverse clones were identified in pvl-negative strains: three fgs  for ha-mrsa strains and four fgs  for ca-mrsa strains; and these strains carried the sccmec element of either type i, iii, ivc or was nontypeable. the nucleotide sequencing of phi7401pvl lysogenized in a ca-mrsa strain jcsc <dig>  revealed that the phage was highly homologous to phisa2mw, with nucleotide identities of more than 95%. furthermore, all pvl positive strains were found to carry the same pvl phage, since these strains were positive in two pcr studies, identifying gene linkage between luks and mtp  and the lysogeny region, both of which are in common with phi7401pvl and phisa2mw.


CONCLUSIONS
our experiments suggest that fg <dig> s. aureus strains have changed to be more virulent by acquiring phi7401pvl, and to be resistant to Î²-lactams by acquiring sccmec elements. these novel clones might have disseminated in the tunisian community as well as at the tunisian hospitals by taking over existing mrsa clones.
