BACKGROUND
paracoccus aminophilus jcm  <dig> is a methylotrophic α-proteobacterium capable of utilizing reduced one-carbon compounds as sole carbon and energy source for growth, including toxic n,n-dimethylformamide, formamide, methanol, and methylamines, which are widely used in the industry. p. aminophilus jcm  <dig>  as many other paracoccus spp., possesses a genome representing a multipartite structure, in which the genomic information is split between various replicons, including chromids, essential plasmid-like replicons, with properties of both chromosomes and plasmids. in this study, whole-genome sequencing and functional genomics approaches were applied to investigate p. aminophilus genome information.


RESULTS
the p. aminophilus jcm  <dig> genome has a multipartite structure, composed of a single circular chromosome and eight additional replicons ranging in size between  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb. functional analyses revealed that two of the replicons, pami <dig> and pami <dig>  are essential for host viability, therefore they should be considered as chromids. both replicons carry housekeeping genes, e.g. responsible for de novo nad biosynthesis and ammonium transport. other mobile genetic elements have also been identified, including  <dig> insertion sequences,  <dig> transposons and  <dig> prophage regions, one of which represents a novel, functional serine recombinase-encoding bacteriophage, ϕpam- <dig>  moreover, in silico analyses allowed us to predict the transcription regulatory network of the jcm  <dig> strain, as well as components of the stress response, recombination, repair and methylation machineries. finally, comparative genomic analyses revealed that p. aminophilus jcm  <dig> has a relatively distant relationship to other representatives of the genus paracoccus.


CONCLUSIONS
p. aminophilus genome exploration provided insights into the overall structure and functions of the genome, with a special focus on the chromids. based on the obtained results we propose the classification of bacterial chromids into two types: “primary” chromids, which are indispensable for host viability and “secondary” chromids, which are essential, but only under some environmental conditions and which were probably formed quite recently in the course of evolution. detailed genome investigation and its functional analysis, makes p. aminophilus jcm  <dig> a suitable reference strain for the genus paracoccus. moreover, this study has increased knowledge on overall genome structure and composition of members within the class alphaproteobacteria.
