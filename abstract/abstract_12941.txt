BACKGROUND
granzyme b  is a serine proteinase expressed by memory t cells and nk cells. methods to measure grzb protein usually involve intracellular  and extracellular  assays. cd <dig> t cells are the main source of grzb during immunological reactions, but activated cd <dig> t cells deploy grzb as well. because grzb is an important mediator of cell death, tissue pathology and disease, clarification of differences of grzb expression and secretion between cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cells is important for understanding effector functions of these cells.


RESULTS
memory cd <dig> and memory cd <dig> t cells were purified from human peripheral blood of healthy donors, and production of grzb was directly compared between memory cd <dig> and memory cd <dig> t cells from the same donors using parallel measurements of flow cytometry , elispot , and elisa . memory cd <dig> t cells constitutively stored significantly more grzb protein  compared to memory cd <dig> t cells as determined by flow cytometry , and this difference remained stable after  <dig> hrs of activation. however, measurement of extracellular grzb by elisa revealed that activated memory cd <dig> t cells secrete similar amounts of grzb  compared to memory cd <dig> t cells . measurement of individual grzb-secreting cells by elispot also indicated that similar numbers of activated memory cd <dig>  and memory cd <dig>  t cells secreted grzb. expression of cd107a further indicated that grzb is secreted similarly by activated cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cells, consistent with the elisa and elispot results. however, memory cd <dig> t cells expressed and secreted more perforin compared to memory cd <dig> t cells, suggesting that perforin may be less associated with grzb function for memory cd <dig> t cells.


CONCLUSIONS
although measurement of intracellular grzb by flow cytometry suggests that a larger proportion of cd <dig> t cells have higher capacity for grzb production compared to cd <dig> t cells, elispot and elisa show that similar numbers of activated cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cells secrete similar amounts of grzb. secretion of grzb by activated cd <dig> t cells may be more tightly controlled compared to cd <dig> t cells.
