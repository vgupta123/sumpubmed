BACKGROUND
corticosterone reduction produced by adrenalectomy  induces apoptosis in dentate gyrus  of the hippocampus, an effect related to an increase in the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene bax. however it has been reported that there is also an increase of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl- <dig>  suggesting the promotion of a neuroprotective phenomenon, perhaps related to the expression of transforming growth factor β <dig> . thus, we have investigated whether tgf-β <dig> levels are induced by adx, and whether apoptosis is increased by blocking the expression of tgf-β <dig> with an antisense oligonucleotide  administered intracerebrally in corticosterone depleted rats.


RESULTS
it was observed an increase of apoptosis in dg,  <dig> and  <dig> days after adx, in agreement with a reduction of corticosterone levels. however, the effect of adx on the number of apoptotic positive cells in dg was decreased  <dig> days after the lesion. in ca1–ca <dig> regions, the effect was only observed  <dig> days after adx. tgf-β <dig> mrna levels were increased  <dig> days after adx. the sustained intracerebro-ventricular administration of a tgf-β <dig> aso via an osmotic mini pump increased apoptosis levels in ca and dg regions  <dig> days after adx as well as sham-operated control animals. no significant effect was observed following a scrambled-oligodeoxynucleotide treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
the changes in both the pattern and the magnitude of apoptotic-cell morphology observed  <dig> and  <dig> days after adx suggest that, as a consequence of the reduction of corticosteroids, some trophic mechanisms restricting cell death to a particular time window are elicited. sustained intracerebral administration of tgf-β <dig> aso increased the apoptosis promoted by adx, suggesting that tgf-β <dig> plays an anti-apoptotic role in vivo in hippocampus.
