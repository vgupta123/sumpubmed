BACKGROUND
in silico candidate gene prioritisation  aids the discovery of gene functions by ranking genes according to an objective relevance score. while several cgp methods have been described for identifying human disease genes, corresponding methods for prokaryotic gene function discovery are lacking. here we present two prokaryotic cgp methods, based on phylogenetic profiles, to assist with this task.


RESULTS
using gene occurrence patterns in sample genomes, we developed two cgp methods  to assist with the discovery of bacterial gene functions. statistical cgp exploits the differences in gene frequency against phenotypic groups, while inductive cgp applies supervised machine learning to identify gene occurrence pattern across genomes. three rediscovery experiments were designed to evaluate the cgp frameworks. the first experiment attempted to rediscover peptidoglycan genes with  <dig> published genome sequences. both cgp methods achieved best areas under receiver operating characteristic curve  of  <dig>  in escherichia coli k- <dig>  and  <dig>  streptococcus agalactiae  <dig>  genomes, with an average improvement in precision of > <dig> -fold and a maximum of >27-fold using statistical cgp. a median auc of > <dig>  could still be achieved with as few as  <dig> genome examples in each group of genome examples in the rediscovery of the peptidoglycan metabolism genes. in the second experiment, a maximum of 109-fold improvement in precision was achieved in the rediscovery of anaerobic fermentation genes in ec-k <dig>  the last experiment attempted to rediscover genes from  <dig> metabolic pathways in sa- <dig>  where  <dig> pathways achieved auc > <dig>  and  <dig> pathways achieved auc > <dig>  with the best inductive cgp algorithms.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that the two cgp methods can assist with the study of functionally uncategorised genomic regions and discovery of bacterial gene-function relationships. our rediscovery experiments also provide a set of standard tasks against which future methods may be compared.
