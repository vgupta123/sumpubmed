BACKGROUND
human brucellosis has been found to be prevalent in the urban areas of kampala, the capital city of uganda. a cross-sectional study was designed to generate precise information on the prevalence of brucellosis in cattle and risk factors for the disease in its urban and peri-urban dairy farming systems.


RESULTS
the adjusted herd prevalence of brucellosis was  <dig> %  and the adjusted individual animal prevalence was  <dig> %  based on diagnosis using commercial kits of the competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  for brucella abortus antibodies. mean within-herd prevalence was found to be  <dig> %  and brucellosis prevalence in an infected herd ranged from  <dig> % to 50%. a risk factor could not be identified at the animal level but two risk factors were identified at the herd level: large herd size and history of abortion. the mean number of milking cows in a free-grazing herd  was significantly larger than a herd with a movement restricted .


CONCLUSIONS
vaccination should be targeted at commercial large-scale farms with free-grazing farming to control brucellosis in cattle in and around kampala city.
