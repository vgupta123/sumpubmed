BACKGROUND
"open" transcriptome analysis methods allow to study gene expression without a priori knowledge of the transcript sequences. as of now, sage , longsage and mpss  are the mostly used methods for "open" transcriptome analysis. both longsage and mpss rely on the isolation of  <dig> pb tag sequences from each transcript. in contrast to longsage, the high throughput sequencing method used in mpss enables the rapid sequencing of very large libraries containing several millions of tags, allowing deep transcriptome analysis. however, a bias in the complexity of the transcriptome representation obtained by mpss was recently uncovered.


RESULTS
in order to make a deep analysis of mouse hypothalamus transcriptome avoiding the limitation introduced by mpss, we combined longsage with the solexa sequencing technology and obtained a library of more than  <dig> millions of tags. we then compared it to a longsage library of mouse hypothalamus sequenced with the sanger method.


CONCLUSIONS
we found that solexa sequencing technology combined with longsage is perfectly suited for deep transcriptome analysis. in contrast to mpss, it gives a complex representation of transcriptome as reliable as a longsage library sequenced by the sanger method.
