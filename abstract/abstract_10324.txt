BACKGROUND
the aim of this study was to assess validation evidence for a sedation scale for dogs. we hypothesized that the chosen sedation scale would be unreliable when used by different raters and show poor discrimination between sedation protocols.

a sedation scale  was used to score  <dig> dogs scheduled to receive sedation at two veterinary clinics in a prospective trial. scores recorded by a single observer were used to assess internal consistency and construct validity of the scores. to assess inter-rater reliability, video-recordings of sedation assessment were randomized and blinded for viewing by  <dig> raters untrained in the scale. videos were also edited to allow assessment of inter-rater reliability of an abbreviated scale  by  <dig> different raters.


RESULTS
both sedation scales exhibited excellent internal consistency and very good inter-rater reliability . the full scale discriminated between the most common protocols: dexmedetomidine-hydromorphone  and acepromazine-hydromorphone .


CONCLUSIONS
the hypothesis was rejected. full and abbreviated scales showed excellent internal consistency and very good reliability between multiple untrained raters. the full scale differentiated between levels of sedation.
