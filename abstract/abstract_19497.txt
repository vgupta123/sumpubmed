BACKGROUND
although candida albicans and candida dubliniensis are most closely related, both species behave significantly different with respect to morphogenesis and virulence. in order to gain further insight into the divergent routes for morphogenetic adaptation in both species, we investigated qualitative along with quantitative differences in the transcriptomes of both organisms by cdna deep sequencing.


RESULTS
following genome-associated assembly of sequence reads we were able to generate experimentally verified databases containing  <dig> and  <dig> genes for c. albicans and c. dubliniensis, respectively. about 95% of the transcriptionally active regions  contain open reading frames while the remaining tars most likely represent non-coding rnas. comparison of our annotations with publically available gene models for c. albicans and c. dubliniensis confirmed approximately 95% of already predicted genes, but also revealed so far unknown novel tars in both species. qualitative cross-species analysis of these databases revealed in addition to  <dig> orthologs also  <dig> and  <dig> species-specific protein coding genes for c. albicans and c. dubliniensis, respectively. furthermore, quantitative transcriptional profiling using rna-seq revealed significant differences in the expression of orthologs across both species. we defined a core subset of  <dig> hyphal-specific genes required for both species, as well as a set of  <dig> genes that seem to be specifically induced during hyphal morphogenesis in c. albicans.


CONCLUSIONS
species-specific adaptation in c. albicans and c. dubliniensis is governed by individual genetic repertoires but also by altered regulation of conserved orthologs on the transcriptional level.
