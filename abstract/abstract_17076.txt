BACKGROUND
as biology becomes an increasingly computational science, it is critical that we develop software tools that support not only bioinformaticians, but also bench biologists in their exploration of the vast and complex data-sets that continue to build from international genomic, proteomic, and systems-biology projects. the biomoby interoperability system was created with the goal of facilitating the movement of data from one web-based resource to another to fulfill the requirements of non-expert bioinformaticians. in parallel with the development of biomoby, the european mygrid project was designing taverna, a bioinformatics workflow design and enactment tool. here we describe the marriage of these two projects in the form of a taverna plug-in that provides access to many of biomoby's features through the taverna interface.


RESULTS
the exposed biomoby functionality aids in the design of "sensible" biomoby workflows, aids in pipelining biomoby and non-biomoby-based resources, and ensures that end-users need only a minimal understanding of both biomoby, and the taverna interface itself. users are guided through the construction of syntactically and semantically correct workflows through plug-in calls to the moby central registry. moby central provides a menu of only those biomoby services capable of operating on the data-type that exist at any given position in the workflow. moreover, the plug-in automatically and correctly connects a selected service into the workflow such that users are not required to understand the nature of the inputs or outputs for any service, leaving them to focus on the biological meaning of the workflow they are constructing, rather than the technical details of how the services will interoperate.


CONCLUSIONS
with the availability of the biomoby plug-in to taverna, we believe that biomoby-based web services are now significantly more useful and accessible to bench scientists than are more traditional web services.
