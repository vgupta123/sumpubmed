BACKGROUND
phosphorus  deficiency is one of the major nutrient stresses limiting plant growth. the uptake of p by plants is well considered to be mediated by a number of high-affinity phosphate  transporters belonging to the pht <dig> family. although the pht <dig> genes have been extensively identified in several plant species, there is a lack of systematic analysis of the pht <dig> gene family in any solanaceous species thus far.


RESULTS
here, we report the genome-wide analysis, phylogenetic evolution and expression patterns of the pht <dig> genes in tomato . a total of eight putative pht <dig> genes , distributed on three chromosomes , were identified through extensive searches of the released tomato genome sequence database. chromosomal organization and phylogenetic tree analysis suggested that the six pht <dig> paralogues, lept1/ <dig>  lept2/ <dig> and lept4/ <dig>  which were assigned into three pairs with very close physical distance, were produced from recent tandem duplication events that occurred after solanaceae splitting with other dicot families. expression analysis of these pht <dig> members revealed that except lept <dig>  of which the transcript was undetectable in all tissues, the other seven paralogues showed differential but partial-overlapping expression patterns. lept <dig> and lept <dig> were ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined, and their transcripts were induced abundantly in response to pi starvation; lept <dig> and lept <dig>  the two paralogues harboring identical coding sequence, were predominantly expressed in pi-deficient roots; lept <dig>  lept <dig> and lept <dig> were strongly activated in the roots colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi under low-p, but not high-p condition. histochemical analysis revealed that a 1250-bp lept <dig> promoter fragment and a 471-bp lept <dig> promoter fragment containing the two elements, mycs and p1bs, were sufficient to direct the gus reporter expression in mycorrhizal roots and were limited to distinct cells harboring am fungal structures. additionally, the four paralogues, lept <dig>  lept <dig>  lept <dig> and lept <dig>  were very significantly down-regulated in the mycorrhizal roots under low pi supply condition.


CONCLUSIONS
the results obtained from this study provide new insights into the evolutionary expansion, functional divergence and genetic redundancy of the pht <dig> genes in response to pi deficiency and mycorrhizal symbiosis in tomato.
