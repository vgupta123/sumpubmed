BACKGROUND
hemoglobin is a rich source of biological peptides. as a byproduct and even wastewater of poultry-slaughtering facilities, chicken blood is one of the most abundant source of hemoglobin.


RESULTS
in this study, the chicken hemoglobin antimicrobial peptides  were isolated and the antimicrobial and bactericidal activities were tested by the agarose diffusion assay, minimum inhibitory concentration  analysis, minimal bactericidal concentration  analysis, and time-dependent inhibitory and bactericidal assays. the results demonstrated that chap had potent and rapid antimicrobial activity against  <dig> bacterial strains, including  <dig> multidrug-resistant bacterial strains. bacterial biofilm and nacl permeability assays, transmission electron microscopy  and scanning electron microscopy  were further performed to detect the mechanism of its antimicrobial effect. additionally, chap showed low hemolytic activity, embryo toxicity, and high stability in different temperatures and animal plasma.


CONCLUSIONS
chap may have great potential for expanding production and development value in animal medication, the breeding industry and environment protection.
