BACKGROUND
aminopeptidase n  type proteins isolated from several species of lepidopteran insects have been implicated as bacillus thuringiensis  toxin-binding proteins  for cry toxins. we examined brush border membrane vesicle  proteins from the mosquito anopheles quadrimaculatus to determine if apns from this organism would bind mosquitocidal cry toxins that are active to it.


RESULTS
a 100-kda protein with apn activity  was isolated from the brush border membrane of anopheles quadrimaculatus. native state binding analysis by surface plasmon resonance shows that apnanq  <dig> forms tight binding to a mosquitocidal bt toxin, cry11ba, but not to cry2aa, cry4ba or cry11aa.


CONCLUSIONS
an aminopeptidase from anopheles quadrimaculatus mosquitoes is a specific binding protein for bacillus thuringiensis cry11ba.
