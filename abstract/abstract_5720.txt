BACKGROUND
glycogen synthase kinase- <dig>  activity is repressed following insulin treatment of cells. pharmacological inhibition of gsk <dig> mimics the effect of insulin on phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase , glucose- <dig> phosphatase  and igf binding protein- <dig>  gene expression. caat/enhancer binding protein alpha  regulates these gene promoters in liver and is phosphorylated on two residues  by gsk <dig>  although the functional outcome of the phosphorylation has not been established. we aimed to establish whether cebpα is a link between gsk <dig> and these gene promoters.


RESULTS
c/ebpα represses the igfbp <dig> thymine-rich insulin response element , but mutation of t <dig> or t <dig> of c/ebpα to non-phosphorylatable alanines has no effect on c/ebpα activity in liver cells . phosphorylation of t222/t <dig> is decreased by gsk <dig> inhibition, suggesting gsk <dig> does phosphorylate t222/ <dig> in intact cells. however, phosphorylation was not altered by treatment of liver cells with insulin. meanwhile c/ebpα activity in 3t <dig> l <dig> preadipocytes was enhanced by mutation of t222/t <dig> and/or s <dig> to alanine residues. finally, we demonstrate that c/ebpα is a very poor substrate for gsk <dig> in vitro and in cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the work demonstrates an important role for this domain in the regulation of c/ebpα activity in adipocytes but not hepatocytes, however gsk <dig> phosphorylation of these residues does not mediate regulation of this c/ebp activity. in short, we find no evidence that c/ebpα activity is regulated by direct phosphorylation by gsk <dig>
