BACKGROUND
a central question in cancer biology is what changes cause a healthy cell to form a tumor. gene expression data could provide insight into this question, but it is difficult to distinguish between a gene that causes a change in gene expression from a gene that is affected by this change. furthermore, the proteins that regulate gene expression are often themselves not regulated at the transcriptional level. here we propose a bayesian modeling framework we term regnetb that uses mechanistic information about the gene regulatory network to distinguish between factors that cause a change in expression and genes that are affected by the change. we test this framework using human gene expression data describing localized prostate cancer progression.


RESULTS
the top regulatory relationships identified by regnetb include the regulation of rln <dig>  rln <dig>  by pax <dig>  the regulation of acpp  by jun, bach <dig> and bach <dig>  and the co-regulation of pgc and gdf <dig> by maz and taf <dig>  these target genes are known to participate in tumor progression, but the suggested regulatory roles of pax <dig>  bach <dig>  bach <dig>  maz and taf <dig> in the process is new.


CONCLUSIONS
integrating gene expression data and regulatory topologies can aid in identifying potentially causal mechanisms for observed changes in gene expression.
