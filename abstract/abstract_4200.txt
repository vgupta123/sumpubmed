BACKGROUND
gal <dig> enhancer trap systems driving expression of lacz and gfp reporters have been characterized and widely used in drosophila. however, a gal <dig> enhancer trap system in arabidopsis has not been described in the primary literature. in drosophila, the reporters possess a gal <dig> upstream activation sequence  as five repeats  and lines that express gal <dig> from tissue specific enhancers have also been used for the ectopic expression of any transgene . while gal <dig> transactivation has been demonstrated in arabidopsis, wide use of a trap has not emerged in part because of the lack of detailed analysis, which is the purpose of the present study.


RESULTS
a key feature of this study is the use of luciferase  as the primary reporter and rsgfp-gus as secondary reporters. reporters driven by a 5xuas are better suited in arabidopsis than those containing a 1x or 2x uas. a 5xuas-luc reporter is expressed at high levels in arabidopsis lines transformed with gal <dig> driven by the full, enhanced 35s promoter. in contrast, a minimum 35s  upstream of gal <dig> acts as an enhancer trap system. luciferase expression in trap lines of the t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig> generations are generally stable but by the t <dig> generation approximately 25% of the lines are significantly silenced. this silencing is reversed by growing plants on media containing 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. quantitative multiplex rt-pcr on the gal <dig> and luc mrna indicate that this silencing can occur at the level of gal <dig> or luc transcription. production of a  <dig>  event library and observations on screening, along with the potential for a gal <dig> driver system in other plant species are discussed.


CONCLUSIONS
the gal <dig> trap system described here uses the 5xuas-luc and 5xuas rsgfp-gus as reporters and allows for in planta quantitative screening, including the rapid monitoring for silencing. we conclude that in about 75% of the cases silencing is at the level of transcription of the gal <dig> transgene and is at an acceptable frequency to make the gal <dig> trap system in arabidopsis of value. this system will be useful for the isolation and comprehensive characterization of specific reporter and driver lines.
