BACKGROUND
the resistance of cephalosporins is significantly serious in veterinary clinic. in order to inhibit the bacterial resistance production, the mutant selection window  hypothesis with escherichia coli  atcc  <dig> exposed to cefquinome in an animal tissue-cage model was investigated.


RESULTS
localized infection with e. coli was established in piglets, and the infected animals were administrated intramuscularly with various doses and intervals of cefquinome to provide antibiotic concentrations below the mic <dig>  between the mic <dig> and the mutant prevention concentration , and above the mpc. e. coli lost susceptibility when drug concentrations fluctuated between the lower and upper boundaries of the window, which defined in vitro as the mic <dig>  and the mpc  respectively. for pk/pd parameters, there were no mutant selection enrichment when t>mic <dig> was ≤ 25% or t>mpc was ≥ 50% of administration interval. when t>mic <dig> was > 25% and t>mpc was <50% of administration interval, resistance selection was observed. when auc <dig> h/mic <dig> and auc <dig> h/mpc were considered, the mutant selection window extended from  <dig>  h to  <dig>  h and from  <dig>  h to  <dig>  h, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings demonstrate that the msw exists in vivo for time-dependent antimicrobial agents, and its boundaries fit well with those determined in vitro. maintenance of antimicrobial concentrations above the mpc for > 50% of administration interval is a straightforward way to restrict the acquisition of resistance in this tissue cage model. this situation was achieved with daily intramuscular doses of 1 mg cefquinome/kg body weight.
