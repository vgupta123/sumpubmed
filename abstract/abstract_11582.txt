BACKGROUND
in many regions of the world, wild mammals act as reservoir of mycobacterium bovis, a situation that prevents the eradication of bovine tuberculosis. in order to observe whether a strain isolated from a wild boar, previously tested as highly virulent in a mice model, is also virulent in cattle, we performed cattle experimental inoculation with this strain


RESULTS
groups of friesian calves were either infected with the wild boar strain m. bovis 04- <dig> or with the bovine strain nctc <dig> as a control. we found that antigen-specific ifn-Î³ release in whole blood samples occurred earlier in animals infected with m. bovis 04- <dig>  both m. bovis strains resulted in a positive skin test, with animals infected with the wild boar isolate showing a stronger response. these results and the presence of more severe organ lesions, with granuloma and pneumonic areas in cattle demonstrate that the wild boar isolate is more virulent than the nctc <dig> strain. additionally, we tested the infectivity of the m. bovis strains in guinea pigs and found that m. bovis 04- <dig> had the highest pathogenicity.


CONCLUSIONS
m. bovis strains isolated from wild boars may be pathogenic for cattle, producing tb lesions.
