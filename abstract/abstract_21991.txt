BACKGROUND
circulating enterovirus  <dig> -associated hand, foot, and mouth disease is on the rise in the asian-pacific region. although animal models have been developed using mouse-adapted ev-a <dig> strains, mouse models using primary ev-a <dig> isolates are scarce. lethal animal models with circulating ev-a <dig> infection would contribute to studies of pathogenesis as well as vaccine development and evaluation.


RESULTS
in this study, we established a lethal mouse model using primary ev-a <dig> isolates from patients infected with serotypes that are currently circulating in humans. we also characterized the dose-dependent virulence and pathologic changes of circulating ev-a <dig> in this mouse model. most importantly, we have established this mouse model as a suitable system for ev-a <dig> vaccine evaluation. an inactivated ev-a <dig> vaccine candidate offered complete protection from death induced by various circulating ev-a <dig> viruses to neonatal mice that were born to immunized female mice. the sera of the immunized dams and their pups showed higher neutralization titers against multiple circulating ev-a <dig> viruses.


CONCLUSIONS
thus, our newly established animal model using primary ev-a <dig> isolates is helpful for future studies on viral pathogenesis and vaccine and drug development.
