BACKGROUND
next generation sequencing has significantly increased the speed at which single nucleotide polymorphisms  can be discovered and subsequently used as molecular markers for research. unfortunately, for species such as common bean  which do not have a whole genome sequence available, the use of next generation sequencing for snp discovery is much more difficult and costly. to this end we developed a method which couples sequences obtained from the roche 454-flx system  with the illumina genome analyzer  for high-throughput snp discovery.


RESULTS
using a multi-tier reduced representation library we discovered a total of  <dig>  snps of which  <dig>  contained sufficient flanking genomic sequence for snp assay development. using sanger sequencing to determine the validation rate of these snps, we found that 86% are likely to be true snps. furthermore, we designed a goldengate assay which contained  <dig>  of the  <dig>  predicted snps. a total of  <dig> of the  <dig>  snps produced a working goldengate assay .


CONCLUSIONS
through combining two next generation sequencing techniques we have developed a method that allows high-throughput snp discovery in any diploid organism without the need of a whole genome sequence or the creation of normalized cdna libraries. the need to only perform one  <dig> run and one ga sequencer run allows high-throughput snp discovery with sufficient sequence for assay development to be performed in organisms, such as common bean, which have limited genomic resources.
