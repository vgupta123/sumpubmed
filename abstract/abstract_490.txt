BACKGROUND
in conditions of nitrogen limitation, saccharomyces cerevisiae strains differ in their fermentation capacities, due to differences in their nitrogen requirements. the mechanisms ensuring the maintenance of glycolytic flux in these conditions are unknown. we investigated the genetic basis of these differences, by studying quantitative trait loci  in a population of  <dig> individuals from the f <dig> segregant population generated from a cross between two strains with different nitrogen requirements for efficient fermentation.


RESULTS
by comparing two bulks of segregants with low and high nitrogen requirements, we detected four regions making a quantitative contribution to these traits. we identified four polymorphic genes, in three of these four regions, for which involvement in the phenotype was validated by hemizygote comparison. the functions of the four validated genes, gcn <dig>  mds <dig>  arg <dig> and bio <dig>  relate to key roles in nitrogen metabolism and signaling, helping to maintain fermentation performance.


CONCLUSIONS
this study reveals that differences in nitrogen requirement between yeast strains results from a complex allelic combination. the identification of three genes involved in sensing and signaling nitrogen and specially one from the tor pathway as affecting nitrogen requirements suggests a role for this pathway in regulating the fermentation rate in starvation through unknown mechanisms linking nitrogen signaling to glycolytic flux.
