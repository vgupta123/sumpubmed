BACKGROUND
increasing evidence from dna sequence data has revealed that phylogenies based on different genes may drastically differ from each other. this may be due to either inter- or intralineage processes, or to methodological or stochastic errors. here we investigate a spectacular case where two parts of the same gene  show conflicting phylogenies within silene . slx <dig> and sly <dig> are sex-linked genes on the sex chromosomes of dioecious members of silene sect. elisanthe.


RESULTS
we sequenced the homologues of the slx1/y <dig> genes in several sileneae species. we demonstrate that different parts of the slx1/y <dig> region give different phylogenetic signals. the major discrepancy is that silene vulgaris and s. sect. conoimorpha  exchange positions. to determine whether gene duplication followed by recombination  may explain the phylogenetic conflict in the silene slx1/y <dig> gene, we use a novel probabilistic, multiple primer-pair pcr approach. we did not find any evidence supporting gene duplication/loss as explanation to the phylogenetic conflict.


CONCLUSIONS
the phylogenetic conflict in the silene slx1/y <dig> gene cannot be explained by paralogy or artefacts, such as in vitro recombination during pcr. the support for the conflict is strong enough to exclude methodological or stochastic errors as likely sources. instead, the phylogenetic incongruence may have been caused by recombination of two divergent alleles following ancient interspecific hybridization or incomplete lineage sorting. these events probably took place several million years ago. this example clearly demonstrates that different parts of the genome may have different evolutionary histories and stresses the importance of using multiple genes in reconstruction of taxonomic relationships.
