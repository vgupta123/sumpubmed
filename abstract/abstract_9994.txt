BACKGROUND
the public and private sector in the eu spend around € <dig> million per year on animal health and welfare related research. an objective process to identify critical gaps in knowledge and available control tools should aid the prioritisation of research in order to speed up the development of new or improved diagnostics, vaccines and pharmaceuticals and reduce the burden of animal diseases.

method
here, we describe the construction of a database based on expert consultation for  <dig> infectious diseases of animals.


RESULTS
for each disease, an expert group produced a disease and product analysis document that formed the basis for gap analysis and prioritisation. the prioritisation model was based on a closed scoring system, employing identical weights for six evaluation criteria . the diseases were classified into three groups: epizootic diseases, food-producing animal complexes or zoonotic diseases.

discussion
the highly ranked diseases in the prioritisation model comprised mostly zoonotic and epizootic diseases with important gaps identified in vaccine development and pharmaceuticals, respectively. the most important outcome is the identification of key research needs by disease. the rankings and research needs by disease are provided on a public website  which is currently being updated based on new expert consultations. 


CONCLUSIONS
as such, it can become a reference point for funders of research including the european commission, member states, foundations, trusts along with private industry to prioritise research. this will deliver benefits in terms of animal health and welfare but also public health, societal benefits and a safe and secure food supply.
