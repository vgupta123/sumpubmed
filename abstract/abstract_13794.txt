BACKGROUND
reactive oxygen species  are formed under natural physiological conditions and are thought to play an important role in many human diseases. a wide range of antioxidants are involved in cellular defense mechanisms against ros, which can be generated in excess during stressful conditions, these include enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidants. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant responses of mice to two diets control, commercial and the purified ain  <dig> diet, commonly used in experiments with rodents.


RESULTS
malondialdehyde  and hydrogen peroxide  concentrations and superoxide dismutase  and glutathione reductase  activities determined in the liver were lower in the group of mice fed with the ain  <dig> diet, while catalase  activity was higher in the same group, when compared to the group fed on the commercial diet. liver glutathione peroxidase  activity was similar in the groups fed on either ain  <dig> or the commercial diets. two sod isoforms, mn-sodii and a cu/zn-sodv, were specifically reduced in the liver of the ain  <dig> diet fed animals.


CONCLUSIONS
the clear differences in antioxidant responses observed in the livers of mice fed on the two diets suggest that the macro- and micro-nutrient components with antioxidant properties, including vitamin e, can promote changes in the activity of enzymes involved in the removal of the ros generated by cell metabolism.
