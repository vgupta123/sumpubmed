BACKGROUND
protein-dna interactions play an important role in many fundamental biological activities such as dna replication, transcription and repair. identification of amino acid residues involved in dna binding site is critical for understanding of the mechanism of gene regulations. in the last decade, there have been a number of computational approaches developed to predict protein-dna binding sites based on protein sequence and/or structural information.


RESULTS
in this article, we present metadbsite, a meta web server to predict dna-binding residues for dna-binding proteins. metadbsite integrates the prediction results from six available online web servers: disis, dnabindr, bindn, bindn-rf, dp-bind and dbs-pred and it solely uses sequence information of proteins. a large dataset of dna-binding proteins is constructed from the protein data bank and it serves as a gold-standard benchmark to evaluate the metadbsite approach and the other six predictors.


CONCLUSIONS
the comparison results show that metadbsite outperforms single individual approach. we believe that metadbsite will become a useful and integrative tool for protein dna-binding residues prediction. the metadbsite web-server is freely available at http://projects.biotec.tu-dresden.de/metadbsite/ and http://sysbio.zju.edu.cn/metadbsite.
