BACKGROUND
one of the most neglected areas of biomedical text mining  is the development of systems based on carefully assessed user needs. we have recently investigated the user needs of an important task yet to be tackled by tm -- cancer risk assessment . here we take the first step towards the development of tm technology for the task: identifying and organizing the scientific evidence required for cra in a taxonomy which is capable of supporting extensive data gathering from biomedical literature.


RESULTS
the taxonomy is based on expert annotation of  <dig> abstracts downloaded from relevant pubmed journals. it classifies  <dig> unique keywords found in the corpus to  <dig> classes which specify core evidence required for cra. we report promising results with inter-annotator agreement tests and automatic classification of pubmed abstracts to taxonomy classes. a simple user test is also reported in a near real-world cra scenario which demonstrates along with other evaluation that the resources we have built are well-defined, accurate, and applicable in practice.


CONCLUSIONS
we present our annotation guidelines and a tool which we have designed for expert annotation of pubmed abstracts. a corpus annotated for keywords and document relevance is also presented, along with the taxonomy which organizes the keywords into classes defining core evidence for cra. as demonstrated by the evaluation, the materials we have constructed provide a good basis for classification of cra literature along multiple dimensions. they can support current manual cra as well as facilitate the development of an approach based on tm. we discuss extending the taxonomy further via manual and machine learning approaches and the subsequent steps required to develop tm technology for the needs of cra.
