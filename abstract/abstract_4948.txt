BACKGROUND
treatment with glucocorticoids after snakebite in dogs is controversial and randomized clinical studies are missing. the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of prednisolone in dogs envenomated by vipera berus in a double-blind placebo-controlled study, after exclusion of dogs treated with antivenom. the two treatment groups were compared regarding clinical status and clinicopathological test results. a total of  <dig> dogs bitten by vipera berus within the previous 24 hours were included. clinical assessment, blood sampling and measurement of the bitten body part were done at admission , after 24 hours  and at a re-examination  after 10– <dig> days. dogs were given prednisolone 1 mg/kg bodyweight  or saline  subcutaneously in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. dogs were examined clinically and mental status and extent of edema were described. furthermore, appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, cardiac arrhythmia and death were recorded. concentrations of c-reactive protein  and high sensitivity cardiac troponin i , hematology variables and prothrombin time  were determined. systemic inflammation was defined as present if crp > 35 mg/l.


RESULTS
none of the dogs died during the study period. the mental status was reduced in 60/ <dig>  of dogs on day  <dig>  compared to 19/ <dig>  on day  <dig>  the proportion of dogs with no or only mild edema increased significantly from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  about one-third of the dogs developed gastrointestinal signs during the study period. cardiac arrhythmia was uncommon. clinicopathological changes included increased total leucocyte count, crp and troponin concentration on day  <dig>  the ctni concentration was increased in dogs with systemic inflammation, compared to dogs without systemic inflammation. a single dose of prednisolone did not significantly affect any of the clinical or clinicopathological parameters studied, except for a higher monocyte count on day  <dig> in dogs that had received prednisolone treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study do not support routine administration of a single dose of prednisolone 1 mg/kg subcutaneously in dogs bitten by vipera berus.
