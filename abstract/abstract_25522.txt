BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica spp. enterica serotype typhimurium  is the most common agent of domestically acquired salmonellosis in finland. subtyping methods which allow the characterization of stm are essential for effective laboratory-based stm surveillance and for recognition of outbreaks. this study describes the diversity of finnish stm isolates using phage typing, antimicrobial susceptible testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  and multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis , and compares the discriminatory power and the concordance of these methods.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> sporadic stm isolates were analysed. the isolates were divided into  <dig> definite phage  types, dominated by dt <dig> , u <dig>  and dt <dig> . of all the isolates, 62 % were susceptible to all the  <dig> antimicrobials tested and 11 % were multidrug resistant. subtyping resulted in  <dig> different xbai-pfge profiles and  <dig> mlva types. the three most common xbai-pfge profiles  and one mlva profile with three single locus variants accounted for 56 % and 49 % of the stm isolates, respectively. the studied isolates showed a genetic similarity of more than 70 % by xbai-pfge. in mlva, 71 % of the isolates lacked sttr <dig> and 77 % missed sttr10p loci. nevertheless, the calculated simpson’s diversity index for xbai-pfge was  <dig>   and for mlva  <dig>  . however, the discriminatory power of the 5-loci mlva varied among the phage types. the highest concordance of the results was found between xbai-pfge and phage typing .


CONCLUSIONS
in general, the calculated discriminatory power was higher for genotyping methods  than for phenotyping methods . overall, comparable diversity indices were calculated for pfge and mlva . however, mlva was phage type dependent providing better discrimination of the most common phage types. furthermore, 5-loci mlva was a less laborious method and easier to interpret than xbai-pfge. thus, the laboratory-based surveillance of the finnish human stm infections has been conducted with a combination of phage typing, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and 5-loci mlva since january  <dig>
