BACKGROUND
sugar plays a central role as a source of carbon metabolism and energy production and a signaling molecule in diverse growth and developmental processes and environmental adaptation in plants. it is known that sugar metabolism and allocation between different physiological functions is intimately associated with flowering transition in many plant species. the indeterminate domain -containing transcription factor idd <dig> regulates flowering time by modulating sugar metabolism and transport under sugar-limiting conditions in arabidopsis. meanwhile, it has been reported that sucrose nonfermenting-1-related protein kinase  <dig> , which acts as a sensor of cellular energy metabolism, is activated by sugar deprivation. notably, snrk1-overexpressing plants and idd8-deficient mutants exhibit similar phenotypes, including delayed flowering, suggesting that snrk <dig> is involved in the idd8-mediated metabolic control of flowering.


RESULTS
we examined whether the sugar deprivation-sensing snrk <dig> is functionally associated with idd <dig> in flowering time control through biochemical and molecular genetic approaches. overproduction of akin <dig>  the catalytic subunit of snrk <dig>  delayed flowering in arabidopsis, as was observed in idd8-deficient idd8- <dig> mutant. we found that akin <dig> interacts with idd <dig> in the nucleus. consequently, akin <dig> phosphorylates idd <dig> primarily at two serine  residues, ser- <dig> and ser- <dig>  which reside in the fourth zinc finger  domain that mediates dna binding and protein-protein interactions. akin10-mediated phosphorylation did not affect the subcellular localization and dna-binding property of idd <dig>  instead, the transcriptional activation activity of the phosphorylated idd <dig> was significantly reduced. together, these observations indicate that akin <dig> antagonizes the idd <dig> function in flowering time control, a notion that is consistent with the delayed flowering phenotypes of akin10-overexpressing plants and idd8- <dig> mutant.


CONCLUSIONS
our data show that snrk <dig> and its substrate idd <dig> constitute a sugar metabolic pathway that mediates the timing of flowering under sugar deprivation conditions. in this signaling scheme, the snrk <dig> signals are directly integrated into the idd8-mediated gene regulatory network that governs flowering transition in response to fluctuations in sugar metabolism, further supporting the metabolic control of flowering.
