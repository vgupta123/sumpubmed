BACKGROUND
identification of novel drug targets and their inhibitors is a major challenge in the field of drug designing and development. diaminopimelic acid  pathway is a unique lysine biosynthetic pathway present in bacteria, however absent in mammals. this pathway is vital for bacteria due to its critical role in cell wall biosynthesis. one of the essential enzymes of this pathway is dihydrodipicolinate synthase , considered to be crucial for the bacterial survival. in view of its importance, the development and prediction of potent inhibitors against dhdps may be valuable to design effective drugs against bacteria, in general.


RESULTS
this paper describes a methodology for predicting novel/potent inhibitors against dhdps. here, quantitative structure activity relationship  models were trained and tested on experimentally verified  <dig> enzyme's inhibitors having inhibitory value  in the range of  <dig> - <dig>  these inhibitors were docked at the active site of dhdps  using autodock software, which resulted in  <dig> energy-based descriptors. for qsar modeling, multiple linear regression  model was engendered using best four energy-based descriptors yielding correlation values r/q <dig> of  <dig> / <dig>  and mae of  <dig> . additionally, support vector machine  based model was developed with three crucial descriptors selected using f-stepping remove-one approach, which enhanced the performance by attaining r/q <dig> values of  <dig> / <dig>  and mae of  <dig> . to validate the performance of qsar models, external cross-validation procedure was adopted which accomplished high training/testing correlation values  in the range of  <dig> - <dig> / <dig> - <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggests that ligand-receptor binding interactions for dhdps employing qsar modeling seems to be a promising approach for prediction of antibacterial agents. to serve the experimentalist to develop novel/potent inhibitors, a webserver "kidoq" has been developed http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/kidoq, which allows the prediction of ki value of a new ligand molecule against dhdps.
