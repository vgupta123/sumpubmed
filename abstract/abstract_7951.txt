BACKGROUND
assignment of function to new molecular sequence data is an essential step in genomics projects. the usual process involves similarity searches of a given sequence against one or more databases, an arduous process for large datasets.


RESULTS
we present autofact, a fully automated and customizable annotation tool that assigns biologically informative functions to a sequence. key features of this tool are that it  analyzes nucleotide and protein sequence data;  determines the most informative functional description by combining multiple blast reports from several user-selected databases;  assigns putative metabolic pathways, functional classes, enzyme classes, geneontology terms and locus names; and  generates output in html, text and gff formats for the user's convenience. we have compared autofact to four well-established annotation pipelines. the error rate of functional annotation is estimated to be only between 1â€“2%. comparison of autofact to the traditional top-blast-hit annotation method shows that our procedure increases the number of functionally informative annotations by approximately 50%.


CONCLUSIONS
autofact will serve as a useful annotation tool for smaller sequencing groups lacking dedicated bioinformatics staff. it is implemented in perl and runs on linux/unix platforms. autofact is available at .
