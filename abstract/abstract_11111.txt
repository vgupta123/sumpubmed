BACKGROUND
genus clostridium accompanies more than  <dig> known species and at least  <dig> among them are associated with human and animal diseases. at the moment, the treatment of clostridial infections is based on use of antibiotics. however, due to the european ban on the use of antibiotics in livestock production, novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of these hardly curable infections have been evaluated. hence, in this study the antimicrobial effect of newly designed probiotic culture consisted of natural isolates lactobacillus helveticus bgra <dig>  lactobacillus fermentum bghi <dig> and streptococcus thermophilus bgvlj1- <dig> against clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens was analyzed.


RESULTS
the probiotic culture showed strong in vitro antimicrobial effect on c. difficile . in addition, individual strains and the probiotic combination exhibited immunomodulatory activity. the probiotic combination significantly increased the proliferation of galt lymphocytes. at the other hand, none of the bacterial treatments  induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines il- <dig> and il-1β by intestinal epithelial cells, caco- <dig>  interestingly, caco- <dig> cells exposed to the probiotic combination produced significantly elevated amount of tgfβ pointing to potential protecting effect of the probiotic. in addition, the results of field trial on spontaneously infected goats revealed reduction of c. perfringens in goats  after the probiotic treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study indicated that the novel probiotic deserves to be further investigated as a promising antimicrobial agent against c. difficile and c. perfringens.
