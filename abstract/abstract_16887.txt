BACKGROUND
telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes at the end of linear eukaryotic chromosomes which maintain the genome integrity by regulating telomere length, preventing recombination and end to end fusion events. multiple proteins associate with telomeres and function in concert to carry out these functions. rap <dig> interacting factor  <dig> , was identified as a protein involved in telomere length regulation in yeast. rif <dig> is conserved upto mammals but its function has diversified from telomere length regulation to maintenance of genome integrity.


RESULTS
we have carried out detailed bioinformatic analyses and identified rif <dig> homologues in  <dig> organisms from yeast to human. we identified rif <dig> homologues in drosophila melanogaster, even though fly telomeres are maintained by a telomerase independent pathway. our analysis shows that drosophila rif <dig>  sequence is phylogenetically closer to the one of vertebrates than yeast and has identified a few rif <dig> specific motifs conserved through evolution. this includes a rif <dig> family specific conserved region within the heat repeat domain and a motif involved in protein phosphatase <dig> docking. we show that drif <dig> is nuclear localized with a prominent heterochromatin association and unlike human rif <dig>  it does not respond to dna damage by localizing to damaged sites. to test the evolutionary conservation of drif <dig> function, we expressed the drif <dig> protein in yeast and hela cells. in yeast, drif <dig> did not perturb yeast rif <dig>  functions; and in hela cells it did not colocalize with dna damage foci.


CONCLUSIONS
telomeres are maintained by retrotransposons in all drosophila species and consequently, telomerase and many of the telomere associated protein homologues are absent, including rap <dig>  which is the binding partner of rif <dig>  we found that a homologue of yrif <dig> protein is present in fly and drif <dig> has evolutionarily conserved motifs. functional studies show that drif <dig> responds differently to dna damage, implying that drif <dig> may have a different function and this may be conserved in other organisms as well.
