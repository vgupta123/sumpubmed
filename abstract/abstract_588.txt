BACKGROUND
in parallel with the quick development of high-throughput technologies, in vivo  experiments for genome-wide identification of protein-dna interactions have been developed. nevertheless, a few questions remain in the field, such as how to distinguish true protein-dna binding  from non-specific protein-dna binding . previous researches tackled the problem by integrated analysis of multiple available sources. however, few systematic studies have been carried out to examine the possible relationships between histone modification and protein-dna binding. here this issue was investigated by using publicly available histone modification data in yeast.


RESULTS
two separate histone modification datasets were studied, at both the open reading frame  and the promoter region of binding targets for  <dig> yeast transcription factors. both results revealed a distinct histone modification pattern between the functional protein-dna binding sites and non-functional ones for almost half of all tfs tested. such difference is much stronger at the orf than at the promoter region. in addition, a protein-histone modification interaction pathway can only be inferred from the functional protein binding targets.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, the results suggest that histone modification information can be used to distinguish the functional protein-dna binding from the non-functional, and that the regulation of various proteins is controlled by the modification of different histone lysines such as the protein-specific histone modification levels.
