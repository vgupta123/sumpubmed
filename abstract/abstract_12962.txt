BACKGROUND
the original sequencing and annotation of the caenorhabditis elegans genome along with recent advances in sequencing technology provide an exceptional opportunity for the genomic analysis of wild-type and mutant strains. using the illumina genome analyzer, we sequenced the entire genome of rec- <dig>  a strain that alters the distribution of meiotic crossovers without changing the overall frequency. rec- <dig> was derived from ethylmethane sulfonate -treated strains, one of which had a high level of transposable element mobility. sequencing of this strain provides an opportunity to examine the consequences on the genome of altering the distribution of meiotic recombination events.


RESULTS
using illumina sequencing and maq software, 83% of the base pair sequence reads were aligned to the reference genome available at wormbase, providing a 21-fold coverage of the genome. using the software programs maq and slider, we observed  <dig> base pair differences between rec- <dig> and the reference genome in wormbase , and  <dig> between the mutagenized rec- <dig>  and the wild-type n <dig> strain . the most frequent base-substitution was g:c to a:t,  <dig> for the entire genome most of which were on chromosomes i or x,  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. with this data removed, no obvious pattern in the distribution of the base differences along the chromosomes was apparent. no major chromosomal rearrangements were observed, but additional insertions of transposable elements were detected. there are  <dig> extra copies of tc <dig>  and  <dig> of tc <dig> in the rec- <dig> genome, most likely the remains of past high-hopper activity in a progenitor strain.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis of high-throughput sequencing was able to detect regions of direct repeat sequences, deletions, insertions of transposable elements, and base pair differences. a subset of sequence alterations affecting coding regions were confirmed by an independent approach using oligo array comparative genome hybridization. the major phenotype of the rec- <dig> strain is an alteration in the preferred position of the meiotic recombination event with no other significant phenotypic consequences. in this study, we observed no evidence of a mutator effect at the nucleotide level attributable to the rec- <dig> mutation.
