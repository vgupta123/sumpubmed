BACKGROUND
acupuncture has been applied to aid in the recovery of post-stroke patients, but its mechanism is unclear. this study aims to analyze the relationship between acupuncture and glucose metabolism in cerebral functional regions in post-stroke patients using  <dig> fdg pet-ct techniques. forty-three ischemic stroke patients were randomly divided into  <dig> groups: the waiguan  needling group, the te <dig> sham needling group, the sham point needling group, the sham point sham needling group and the non-needling group. cerebral functional images of all patients were then acquired using pet-ct scans and processed by spm <dig> software.


RESULTS
compared with the non-needling group, sham needling at te <dig> and needling/sham needling at the sham point did not activate cerebral areas. however, needling at te <dig> resulted in the activation of brodmann area   <dig>  needling/sham needling at te <dig> and needling at the sham point did not deactivate any cerebral areas, whereas sham needling at the sham point led to deactivation in ba <dig>  compared with sham needling at te <dig>  needling at te <dig> activated ba <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and did not deactivate any areas. compared with needling at the sham point, needling at te <dig> had no associated activation but a deactivating effect on ba <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
needling at te <dig> had a regulating effect on cerebral functional areas shown by pet-ct, and this may relate to its impact on the recovery of post-stroke patients.
