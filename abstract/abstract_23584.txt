BACKGROUND
infection of cattle with mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis  causes severe economic losses to the dairy industry in the usa and worldwide. in an effort to better examine diversity among m. ap strains, we used optical mapping to profile genomic variations between strains of m. ap k- <dig>  and m. ap atcc  <dig> .


RESULTS
the assembled physical restriction map of m. ap atcc  <dig> showed a genome size of  <dig>  kb compared to the sequenced k- <dig> genome of  <dig>  kb. interestingly, alignment of the optical map of the m. ap atcc  <dig> genome to the complete m. ap k- <dig> genome sequence revealed a 648-kb inversion around the origin of replication. however, southern blotting, pcr amplification and sequencing analyses of the inverted region revealed that the genome of m. ap k- <dig> differs from the published sequence in the region starting from  <dig> , <dig> bp to  <dig>  bp, spanning the origin of replication. additionally, two new copies of the coding sequences >  <dig> % were identified, identical to the map0849c and map0850c genes located immediately downstream of the map3758c gene.


CONCLUSIONS
the optical map of m. ap atcc  <dig> clearly indicated the miss-assembly of the sequenced genome of m. ap k- <dig>  moreover, it identified  <dig> new genes in m. ap k- <dig> genome. this analysis strongly advocates for the utility of physical mapping protocols to complement genome sequencing projects.
