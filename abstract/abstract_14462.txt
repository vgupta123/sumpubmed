BACKGROUND
african swine fever , a highly contagious fatal acute haemorrhagic viral disease of pigs currently has no treatment or vaccination protocol and it threatens the pig industry worldwide. recent outbreaks were managed by farmers with ethnoveterinary preparations with various claims of effectiveness.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> compounds using gc-ms protocol and asf virus  was significantly reduced by some extracts and fractions of the plant. however, the plant was poorly extracted by water and cytotoxicity was found to be a major problem with the use of the plant since its extracts also reduced the primary cells used in the assay.


CONCLUSIONS
it is confirmed that the plant has antiviral potentials against asf virus and farmersâ€™ claims seem to have certain degree of veracity, but finding the best means of exploring the potential of the plant while reducing its cytotoxic effect in-vitro and in-vivo will be necessary.
