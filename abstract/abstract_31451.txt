BACKGROUND
there are only few data relating the metabolic consequences of feeding diets very low in n- <dig> fatty acids. this experiment carried out in mice aims at studying the impact of dietary n- <dig> polyunsaturated fatty acids  depletion on hepatic metabolism.


RESULTS
n- <dig> pufa depletion leads to a significant decrease in body weight despite a similar caloric intake or adipose tissue weight. n- <dig> pufa depleted mice exhibit hypercholesterolemia  as well as an increase in hepatic cholesteryl ester and triglycerides content. fatty acid pattern is profoundly modified in hepatic phospholipids and triglycerides. the decrease in tissue n-3/n- <dig> pufa ratio correlates with steatosis. hepatic mrna content of key factors involved in lipid metabolism suggest a decreased lipogenesis , and an increased β-oxidation  without modification of fatty acid esterification , secretion  or intracellular transport . histological analysis reveals alterations of liver morphology, which can not be explained by inflammatory or oxidative stress. however, several proteins involved in the unfolded protein response are decreased in depleted mice.


CONCLUSIONS
n- <dig> pufa depletion leads to important metabolic alterations in murine liver. steatosis occurs through a mechanism independent of the shift between β-oxidation and lipogenesis. moreover, long term n- <dig> pufa depletion decreases the expression of factors involved in the unfolded protein response, suggesting a lower protection against endoplasmic reticulum stress in hepatocytes upon n- <dig> pufa deficiency.
