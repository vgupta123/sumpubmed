BACKGROUND
alternative splicing  significantly enhances transcriptome complexity. it is differentially regulated in a wide variety of cell types and plays a role in several cellular processes. here we describe a detailed survey of alternative splicing in grape based on  <dig> solid rnaseq analyses from different tissues, stress conditions and genotypes.


RESULTS
we used the rnaseq data to update the existing grape gene prediction with  <dig>  new coding genes and  <dig>  putative long non-coding rnas. several gene structures have been improved and alternative splicing was described for about 30% of the genes. a link between as and mirnas was shown in  <dig> genes where we found that as affects the mirna target site. a quantitative analysis of the isoforms indicated that most of the spliced genes have one major isoform and tend to simultaneously co-express a low number of isoforms, typically two, with intron retention being the most frequent alternative splicing event.


CONCLUSIONS
as described in arabidopsis, also grape displays a marked as tissue-specificity, while stress conditions produce splicing changes to a minor extent. surprisingly, some distinctive splicing features were also observed between genotypes. this was further supported by the observation that the panel of serine/arginine-rich splicing factors show a few, but very marked differences between genotypes. the finding that a part the splicing machinery can change in closely related organisms can lead to some interesting hypotheses for evolutionary adaptation, that could be particularly relevant in the response to sudden and strong selective pressures.
