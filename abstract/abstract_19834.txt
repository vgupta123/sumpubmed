BACKGROUND
improvements in technology have been accompanied by the generation of large amounts of complex data. this same technology must be harnessed effectively if the knowledge stored within the data is to be retrieved. storing data in ontologies aids its management; ontologies serve as controlled vocabularies that promote data exchange and re-use, improving analysis.

the edinburgh mouse atlas project stores the developmental stages of the mouse embryo in anatomy ontologies. this project is looking at the use of visual data overviews for intuitive analysis of the ontology data.


RESULTS
a prototype has been developed that visualises the ontologies using directed acyclic graphs in two dimensions, with the ability to study detail in regions of interest in isolation or within the context of the overview. this is followed by the development of a technique that layers individual anatomy ontologies in three-dimensional space, so that relationships across multiple data sets may be mapped using physical links drawn along the third axis.


CONCLUSIONS
usability evaluations of the applications confirmed advantages in visual analysis of complex data. this project will look next at data input from multiple sources, and continue to develop the techniques presented to provide intuitive identification of relationships that span multiple ontologies.
