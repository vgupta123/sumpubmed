BACKGROUND
selection of influential genes with microarray data often faces the difficulties of a large number of genes and a relatively small group of subjects. in addition to the curse of dimensionality, many gene selection methods weight the contribution from each individual subject equally. this equal-contribution assumption cannot account for the possible dependence among subjects who associate similarly to the disease, and may restrict the selection of influential genes.


RESULTS
a novel approach to gene selection is proposed based on kernel similarities and kernel weights. we do not assume uniformity for subject contribution. weights are calculated via regularized least squares support vector regression  of class levels on kernel similarities and are used to weight subject contribution. the cumulative sum of weighted expression levels are next ranked to select responsible genes. these procedures also work for multiclass classification. we demonstrate this algorithm on acute leukemia, colon cancer, small, round blue cell tumors of childhood, breast cancer, and lung cancer studies, using kernel fisher discriminant analysis and support vector machines as classifiers. other procedures are compared as well.


CONCLUSIONS
this approach is easy to implement and fast in computation for both binary and multiclass problems. the gene set provided by the rls-svr weight-based approach contains a less number of genes, and achieves a higher accuracy than other procedures.
