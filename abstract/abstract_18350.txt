BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen representing a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. we sequenced the genome of a serotype 11a, st <dig> s. pneumoniae invasive isolate , that was erythromycin-resistant due to the presence of the erm determinant, and carried out analysis of the genome organization and comparison with other pneumococcal genomes.


RESULTS
the genome sequence of s. pneumoniae ap <dig> is  <dig> , <dig> base pair in length. the genome carries  <dig> coding sequences ,  <dig> trna, and  <dig> rrna genes. of the cdss,  <dig> % have a predicted biological known function. ap <dig> contains the pilus islet  <dig> and, although its phenotype corresponds to serotype 11a, it contains an 11d capsular locus. chromosomal rearrangements resulting from a large inversion across the replication axis, and horizontal gene transfer events were observed. the chromosomal inversion is likely implicated in the rebalance of the chromosomal architecture affected by the insertions of two large exogenous elements, the erm-carrying tn <dig> and a functional prophage designated ϕspn_ <dig>  tn <dig> is  <dig>  bp in size and comprises  <dig> orfs. comparative analysis of tn <dig> revealed the presence of a similar genetic element or part of it in related species such as streptococcus pyogenes and also in the anaerobic species finegoldia magna, anaerococcus prevotii and clostridium difficile. the genome of ϕspn_ <dig> is  <dig>  bp in size and is organized in  <dig> orfs grouped into five functional modules. prophages similar to ϕspn_ <dig> were found in pneumococci and in other streptococcal species, showing a high degree of exchange of functional modules. ϕspn_ <dig> viral particles have morphologic characteristics typical of the siphoviridae family and are capable of infecting a pneumococcal recipient strain.


CONCLUSIONS
the sequence of s. pneumoniae ap <dig> chromosome revealed a dynamic genome, characterized by chromosomal rearrangements and horizontal gene transfers. the overall diversity of ap <dig> is driven mainly by the presence of the exogenous elements tn <dig> and ϕspn_ <dig> that show large gene exchanges with other genetic elements of different bacterial species. these genetic elements likely provide ap <dig> with additional genes, such as those conferring antibiotic-resistance, promoting its adaptation to the environment.
