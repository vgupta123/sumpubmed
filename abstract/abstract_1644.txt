BACKGROUND
a typical affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry  experiment includes the purification of a target protein  using an antibody and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis of all proteins co-purifying with the bait . like any other systems biology approach, ap-ms experiments generate a lot of data and visualization has been challenging, especially when integrating ap-ms experiments with orthogonal datasets.


RESULTS
we present circular interaction graph for proteomics , which generates circular diagrams for visually appealing final representation of ap-ms data. through a java based gui, the user inputs experimental and reference data as file in csv format. the resulting circular representation can be manipulated live within the gui before exporting the diagram as vector graphic in pdf format. the strength of cig-p is the ability to integrate orthogonal datasets with each other, e.g. affinity purification data of kinase prpf4b in relation to the functional components of the spliceosome. further, various ap-ms experiments can be compared to each other.


CONCLUSIONS
cig-p aids to present ap-ms data to a wider audience and we envision that the tool finds other applications too, e.g. kinase – substrate relationships as a function of perturbation. cig-p is available under: http://sourceforge.net/projects/cig-p/
