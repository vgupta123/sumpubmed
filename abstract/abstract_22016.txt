BACKGROUND
genome-wide expression profiles reflect the transcriptional networks specific to the given cell context. however, most statistical models try to estimate the average connectivity of the networks from a collection of gene expression data, and are unable to characterize the context-specific transcriptional regulations. we propose an approach for mining context-specific transcription networks from a large collection of gene expression fold-change profiles and composite gene-set information.


RESULTS
using a composite gene-set analysis method, we combine the information of transcription factor binding sites, gene ontology or pathway gene sets and gene expression fold-change profiles for a variety of cell conditions. we then collected all the significant patterns and constructed a database of context-specific transcription networks for human . as a result, context-specific roles of transcription factors as well as their functional targets are readily explored. to validate the approach, nine predicted targets of e2f <dig> in hela cells were tested using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. among them, five  were successfully bound by e2f <dig>  c-jun and the emt transcription networks were also validated from literature.


CONCLUSIONS
regnet is a useful tool for exploring the ternary relationships among the transcription factors, their functional targets and the corresponding cell conditions. it is able to provide useful clues for novel cell-specific transcriptional regulations. the regnet database is available at http://mgrc.kribb.re.kr/regnet.
