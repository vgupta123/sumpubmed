BACKGROUND
current genome-wide association studies  are performed in a single trait framework without considering genetic correlations between important disease traits. hence, the gwas have limitations in discovering genetic risk factors affecting pleiotropic effects.


RESULTS
this work reports a novel data mining approach to discover patterns of multiple phenotypic associations over  <dig> anthropometric and biochemical traits in kare and a new analytical scheme for gwas of multivariate phenotypes defined by the discovered patterns. this methodology applied to the gwas for multivariate phenotype highldlhightg derived from the predicted patterns of the phenotypic associations. the patterns of the phenotypic associations were informative to draw relations between plasma lipid levels with bone mineral density and a cluster of common traits  related to metabolic syndrome . a total of  <dig> snps in six genes  were identified for significant associations with highldlhightg. noteworthy findings were that the significant associations included a mis-sense mutation , a frame shift mutation  and snps in splicing sites .


CONCLUSIONS
the six genes corresponded to rat and mouse quantitative trait loci  that had shown associations with the common traits such as the well characterized ms and even tumor susceptibility. our findings suggest that the six genes may play important roles in the pleiotropic effects on lipid metabolism and the ms, which increase the risk of type  <dig> diabetes and cardiovascular disease. the use of the multivariate phenotypes can be advantageous in identifying genetic risk factors, accounting for the pleiotropic effects when the multivariate phenotypes have a common etiological pathway.
