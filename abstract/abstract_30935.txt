BACKGROUND
in zambia, translocation of wildlife from national parks to private owned game ranches demands that only animals free of infectious diseases that could adversely affect the expansion of the wildlife industry should be translocated to game ranches. sarcoptes mange  has been involved in the reduction of wildlife populations in some species.


RESULTS
sarcoptes mange  was detected and eradicated from two herds of african buffalo  calves captured in the kafue gma in july  <dig> and august  <dig>  the overall prevalence was estimated at  <dig> % . sex had no influence on the occurrence and severity of the disease. of the  <dig> calves used in the study,  <dig> % had good body condition scores,  <dig> % were fair and  <dig> % were poor. of the  <dig> infected calves,  <dig> % were mildly infected,  <dig> % were moderately and  <dig> % were severely infected. body condition score was correlated to the severity of the infection  at capture. eradication of sarcoptes mites from the entire herd using ivermetcin was dependant on the severity of the infection. the overall ability of ivermectin to clear the infection after the first treatment was estimated at  <dig> % . it increased to  <dig> % and 100% after the second and third treatments respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report on the epidemiology and treatment of sarcoptes mange in african buffaloes in zambia. this study improves our understanding about sarcoptes scabiei epidemiology and treatment which will have further applications for the safe animal translocation.
