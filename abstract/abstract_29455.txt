BACKGROUND
caspases are a family of cysteinyl proteases that regulate apoptosis and other biological processes. caspase- <dig> is considered the central executioner member of this family with a wide range of substrates. identification of caspase- <dig> cellular targets is crucial to gain further insights into the cellular mechanisms that have been implicated in various diseases including: cancer, neurodegenerative, and immunodeficiency diseases. to date, over  <dig> caspase- <dig> substrates have been identified experimentally. however, many are still awaiting discovery.


RESULTS
here, we describe a powerful bioinformatics tool that can predict the presence of caspase- <dig> cleavage sites in a given protein sequence using a position-specific scoring matrix  approach. the present tool, which we call cat <dig>  was built using  <dig> confirmed caspase- <dig> substrates that were carefully extracted from the literature. assessing prediction accuracy using  <dig> fold cross validation, our method shows auc  of  <dig> , sensitivity of  <dig> %, and specificity of  <dig> %. the ability of cat <dig> in predicting the precise cleavage site was demonstrated in comparison to existing state-of-the-art tools. in contrast to other tools which were trained on cleavage sites of various caspases as well as other similar proteases, cat <dig> showed a significant decrease in the false positive rate. this cost effective and powerful feature makes cat <dig> an ideal tool for high-throughput screening to identify novel caspase- <dig> substrates.

the developed tool, cat <dig>  was used to screen  <dig>  human proteins with assigned gene ontology terms. the analyses revealed the presence of many potential caspase- <dig> substrates that are not yet described. the majority of these proteins are involved in signal transduction, regulation of cell adhesion, cytoskeleton organization, integrity of the nucleus, and development of nerve cells.


CONCLUSIONS
cat <dig> is a powerful tool that is a clear improvement over existing similar tools, especially in reducing the false positive rate. human proteome screening, using cat <dig>  indicate the presence of a large number of possible caspase- <dig> substrates that exceed the anticipated figure. in addition to their involvement in various expected functions such as cytoskeleton organization, nuclear integrity and adhesion, a large number of the predicted substrates are remarkably associated with the development of nerve tissues.
