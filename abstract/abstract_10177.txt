BACKGROUND
results regarding the use of bovine somatotropin for enhancing fertility in dairy cattle are variable. here, the hypothesis was tested that a single injection of a sustained-release preparation of bovine somatotropin  during the preovulatory period would improve pregnancy success of lactating dairy cows at first service.


RESULTS
the first experiment was conducted in a temperate region of mexico. cows inseminated following natural estrus or timed artificial insemination were given a single injection of bst or a placebo injection at insemination . there was no significant difference between bst and control groups in the proportion of inseminated cows diagnosed pregnant . the second experiment was performed during heat stress in florida. cows were subjected to an ovulation synchronization regimen for first insemination. cows treated with bst received a single injection at  <dig> days before insemination. controls received no additional treatment. as expected, bst did not increase vaginal temperature. treatment with bst did not significantly increase the proportion of inseminated cows diagnosed pregnant although it was numerically greater for the bst group . there was a tendency  for a smaller percent of control cows to have high plasma progesterone concentrations  at day  <dig> after insemination than for bst-treated cows . when only cows that were successfully synchronized were considered, the magnitude of the absolute difference in the percentage of inseminated cows that were diagnosed pregnant between bst and control cows was reduced .


CONCLUSIONS
results failed to indicate a beneficial effect of bst treatment on fertility of lactating dairy cows.
