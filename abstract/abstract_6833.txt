BACKGROUND
protein phosphatase  <dig>  is an enzyme essential to cell viability in the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum . the activity of pp <dig> is regulated by the binding of regulatory subunits, of which there are up to  <dig> in humans, but only  <dig> have been so far reported for the parasite. to better understand the p. falciparum pp <dig>  regulatory network, we here report the use of three strategies to characterize the pfpp <dig> interactome: co-affinity purified proteins identified by mass spectrometry, yeast two-hybrid  screening and in silico analysis of the p. falciparum predicted proteome.


RESULTS
co-affinity purification followed by ms analysis identified  <dig> pfpp <dig> interacting proteins  of which  <dig> contained the rvxf consensus binding,  <dig> with a fxxx motif, also shown to be a pp <dig> binding motif and one with both binding motifs. the y2h screens identified  <dig> proteins of which  <dig> present the rvxf binding motif and  <dig> have the fxxx binding motif. the in silico screen of the pf predicted proteome using a consensus rvxf motif as template revealed the presence of  <dig> potential pips. as further demonstration,  <dig> candidate proteins were validated as pfpp <dig> interacting proteins in an elisa-based assay.


CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on pfpp <dig> interactome. the data reports several conserved pp <dig> interacting proteins as well as a high number of specific interactors to pfpp <dig>  their analysis indicates a high diversity of biological functions for pp <dig> in plasmodium. based on the present data and on an earlier study of the pf interactome, a potential implication of pips in protein folding/proteolysis, transcription and pathogenicity networks is proposed. the present work provides a starting point for further studies on the structural basis of these interactions and their functions in p. falciparum.
