BACKGROUND
stat <dig> and irf <dig> collaborate to induce interferon-γ  stimulated genes , but the extent to which they act alone or together is unclear. the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms  on in vivo binding is also largely unknown.


RESULTS
we show that irf <dig> binds at proximal or distant isg sites twice as often as stat <dig>  increasing to sixfold at the mhc class i locus. stat <dig> almost always bound with irf <dig>  while most irf <dig> binding events were isolated. dual binding sites at remote or proximal enhancers distinguished isgs that were responsive to ifnγ versus cell-specific resistant isgs, which showed fewer and mainly single binding events. surprisingly, inducibility in one cell type predicted isg-responsiveness in other cells. several dbsnps overlapped with stat <dig> and irf <dig> binding motifs, and we developed methodology to rapidly assess their effects. we show that in silico prediction of snp effects accurately reflects altered binding both in vitro and in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
these data reveal broad cooperation between stat <dig> and irf <dig>  explain cell type specific differences in isg-responsiveness, and identify genetic variants that may participate in the pathogenesis of immune disorders.
