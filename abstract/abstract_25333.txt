BACKGROUND

salmonella enterica infections often exhibit a form of immune evasion. we previously observed that probiotic bacteria could prevent inhibition of lymphoproliferation and apoptosis responses of t cells associated with s. enterica infections in orally challenged mice.


RESULTS
in this study, changes in expression of genes related to lymphocyte activation in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues  of mice orally infected with s. enterica with and without treatment with probiotic bacteria were evaluated. probiotic bacteria increased expression of mrna for clusters of differentiation antigen  <dig> , protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type c , and toll-like receptor  <dig>  genes related to t and b cell activation in mouse intestinal tissue. the probiotic bacteria were also associated with reduced mrna expression of a group of genes  related to nuclear factor of kappa light chains enhancer in b cells  signal transduction pathway-regulated cytokine responses. probiotic bacteria were also associated with reduced mrna expression of apoptotic genes  that suggest high avidity lymphocyte sparing. reduced cd <dig> immunostaining in mesenteric lymph nodes  was suggestive of reduced lymphocyte activation in probiotic-treated mice. reduced immunostaining of tlr <dig> in malt of probiotic-treated, s. enterica-infected mice suggests that diminished innate immune sensitivity to s. enterica antigens is associated with preventing lymphocyte deletion.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study are consistent with prevention of s. enterica-induced deletion of lymphocytes by the influence of probiotic bacteria in mucosal lymphoid tissues of mice.
