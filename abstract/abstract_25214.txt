BACKGROUND
the mad <dig> protein, a member of the myc/max/mad network of transcriptional regulators, controls cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. mad <dig> functions as a transcriptional repressor, one direct target gene being the tumor suppressor pten. repression of this gene is critical to mediate the anti-apoptotic function of mad <dig>  under certain conditions it also antagonizes the functions of the oncoprotein myc. previous studies have demonstrated that mad <dig> expression is controlled by different cytokines and growth factors. moreover we have recently demonstrated that the mad <dig> promoter is controlled by the cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor  through the activation of stat <dig>  map kinases and c/ebp transcription factors.


RESULTS
we observed that in addition to g-csf, the cytokine transforming growth factor β  rapidly induced the expression of mad <dig> mrna and protein in promyelocytic tumor cells. moreover we found that c/ebp and sp transcription factors cooperated in regulating the expression of mad <dig>  this cooperativity was dependent on the respective binding sites in the proximal promoter, with the ccaat boxes being bound by c/ebpα/β heterodimers. both c/ebp and sp transcription factors bound constitutively to dna without obvious changes in response to tgfβ <dig>  in addition smad <dig> stimulated the mad <dig> reporter, cooperated with c/ebpα and was bound to the core promoter region. thus smad <dig> appears to be a potential link between tgfβ <dig> signaling and c/ebp regulated promoter activity. moreover tgfβ <dig> stimulated the phosphorylation of polymerase ii at serine  <dig> and its progression into the gene body, consistent with enhanced processivity.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that c/ebp and sp factors provide a platform of transcription factors near the core promoter of the mad <dig> gene that participate in mediating signal transduction events emanating from different cytokine receptors. smad <dig>  a target of tgfβ <dig> signaling, appears to be functionally relevant. we suggest that a key event induced by tgfβ <dig> at the mad <dig> promoter is the recruitment or activation of cofactors, possibly in complex with c/ebp, sp, and smad <dig> transcriptional regulators, that control polymerase activity.
