BACKGROUND
a large number of post-transcriptional modifications of transfer rnas  have been described in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. they are known to influence their stability, turnover, and chemical/physical properties. a specific subset of trnas contains a thiolated uridine residue at the wobble position to improve the codon-anticodon interaction and translational accuracy. the proteins involved in trna thiolation are reminiscent of prokaryotic sulfur transfer reactions and of the ubiquitylation process in eukaryotes. in plants, some of the proteins involved in this process have been identified and show a high degree of homology to their non-plant equivalents. for other proteins, the identification of the plant homologs is much less clear, due to the low conservation in protein sequence.


RESULTS
this manuscript describes the identification of ctu <dig>  the second cytoplasmic thiouridylase protein of arabidopsis thaliana. ctu <dig> is essential for trna thiolation and interacts with rol <dig>  the previously identified ctu <dig> homolog of arabidopsis. ctu <dig> is ubiquitously expressed, yet its activity seems to be particularly important in root tissue. a ctu <dig> knock-out mutant shows an alteration in root development.


CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of ctu <dig> adds a new component to the so far characterized protein network involved in trna thiolation in arabidopsis. ctu <dig> is essential for trna thiolation as a ctu <dig> mutant fails to perform this trna modification. the identified arabidopsis ctu <dig> is the first ctu2-type protein from plants to be experimentally verified, which is important considering the limited conservation of these proteins between plant and non-plant species. based on the arabidopsis protein sequence, ctu2-type proteins of other plant species can now be readily identified.
