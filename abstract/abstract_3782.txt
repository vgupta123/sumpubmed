BACKGROUND
chinese fir  is an important timber species that accounts for 20–30% of the total commercial timber production in china. however, the available genomic information of chinese fir is limited, and this severely encumbers functional genomic analysis and molecular breeding in chinese fir. recently, major advances in transcriptome sequencing have provided fast and cost-effective approaches to generate large expression datasets that have proven to be powerful tools to profile the transcriptomes of non-model organisms with undetermined genomes.


RESULTS
in this study, the transcriptomes of nine tissues from chinese fir were analyzed using the illumina hiseq™  <dig> sequencing platform. approximately  <dig> million paired-end reads were obtained, generating  <dig>  gigabase pairs of sequencing data. these reads were assembled into  <dig>  unique sequences  with an average length of  <dig> bp, amounting to  <dig>  mb. a total of  <dig>  unigenes were supported by more than  <dig> reads,  <dig>   had homologs in the ncbi non-redundant and swiss-prot protein databases, corresponding to  <dig>  unique protein entries. of these unigenes,  <dig>  were assigned to gene ontology classes, and  <dig>  were clustered into orthologous groups. a total of  <dig>   were mapped to  <dig> pathways by blast comparison against the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database. the majority of the genes encoding the enzymes in the biosynthetic pathways of cellulose and lignin were identified in the unigene dataset by targeted searches of their annotations. and a number of candidate chinese fir genes in the two metabolic pathways were discovered firstly. eighteen genes related to cellulose and lignin biosynthesis were cloned for experimental validating of transcriptome data. overall  <dig> unigenes, covering different regions of these selected genes, were found by alignment. their expression patterns in different tissues were analyzed by qrt-pcr to explore their putative functions.


CONCLUSIONS
a substantial fraction of transcript sequences was obtained from the deep sequencing of chinese fir. the assembled unigene dataset was used to discover candidate genes of cellulose and lignin biosynthesis. this transcriptome dataset will provide a comprehensive sequence resource for molecular genetics research of c. lanceolata.
