BACKGROUND
to conserve critically endangered predators, we also need to conserve the prey species upon which they depend. velvet geckos  are a primary prey for the endangered broad-headed snake , which is restricted to sandstone habitats in southeastern australia. we sequenced the nd <dig> gene from  <dig> velvet geckos, to clarify the lizards’ phylogeographic history and landscape genetics. we also analysed  <dig> records from a longterm  capture-mark-recapture program at three sites, to evaluate dispersal rates of geckos as a function of locality, sex and body size.


RESULTS
the genetic analyses revealed three ancient lineages in the north, south and centre of the species’ current range. estimates of gene flow suggest low dispersal rates, constrained by the availability of contiguous rocky habitat. mark-recapture records confirm that these lizards are highly sedentary, with most animals moving < 30 m from their original capture site even over multi-year periods.


CONCLUSIONS
the low vagility of these lizards suggests that they will be slow to colonise vacant habitat patches; and hence, efforts to restore degraded habitats for broad-headed snakes may need to include translocation of lizards.
