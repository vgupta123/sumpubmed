BACKGROUND
dna methylation by the dnmt family occurs in vertebrates and invertebrates, including ascidians, and is thought to play important roles in gene regulation and genome stability, especially in vertebrates. however, the global methylation patterns of vertebrates and invertebrates are distinctive. whereas almost all cpg sites are methylated in vertebrates, with the exception of those in cpg islands, the ascidian genome contains approximately equal amounts of methylated and unmethylated regions. curiously, methylation status can be reliably estimated from the local frequency of cpg dinucleotides in the ascidian genome. methylated and unmethylated regions tend to have few and many cpg sites, respectively, consistent with our knowledge of the methylation status of cpg islands and other regions in mammals. however, dna methylation patterns and levels in vertebrates and invertebrates have not been analyzed in the same way.


RESULTS
using a new computational methodology based on the decomposition of the bimodal distributions of methylated and unmethylated regions, we estimated the extent of the global methylation patterns in a wide range of animals. we then examined the epigenetic changes in silico along the phylogenetic tree. we observed a gradual transition from fractional to global patterns of methylation in deuterostomes, rather than a clear demarcation between vertebrates and invertebrates. when we applied this methodology to six piscine genomes, some of which showed features similar to those of invertebrates.


CONCLUSIONS
the mammalian global dna methylation pattern was probably not acquired at an early stage of vertebrate evolution, but gradually expanded from that of a more ancient organism.
