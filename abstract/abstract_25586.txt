BACKGROUND
haemophilus parasuis  can invade the body and cause systemic infection under stress conditions. marbofloxacin has been recommended for the treatment of swine infections. however, few studies have investigated the pk/pd characteristics and pk/pd cutoff  of this drug against h. parasuis.


RESULTS
mics of marbofloxacin against  <dig> h. parasuis isolates were determined. the mic <dig> and mic <dig> were  <dig> and  <dig> mg/l, respectively. an in vitro dynamic pk/pd model was established to study the pk/pd relationship of marbofloxacin against h. parasuis. the pk/pd surrogate markers cmax/mic, cmax/mpc ) and auc24h/mic, auc24h/mpc  simulated the antimicrobial effect of marbofloxacin successfully with the r <dig> of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the target values of 3-log10-unit and 4-log10-unit reduction for auc24h/mpc were  <dig> and  <dig>  while the same efficacy for auc24h/mic were  <dig> and  <dig>  the copd deduced from monte carlo simulation  for marbofloxacin against h. parasuis was  <dig>  mg/l. the recommended dose of marbofloxacin against h. parasuis with mic ≤  <dig> mg/l was  <dig> mg/kg body weight .


CONCLUSIONS
the pk/pd surrogate markers auc24h/mic, cmax/mic and auc24h/mpc, cmax/mpc properly described the effects of marbofloxacin. marbofloxacin can achieve the best efficacy at dosage of  <dig> mg/kg bw for strains with mic values ≤  <dig> mg/l, therefore, it is obligatory to know the sensitivity of the pathogen and to treat animals as early as possible. the very first copd provide fundamental data for marbofloxacin breakpoint determination.
