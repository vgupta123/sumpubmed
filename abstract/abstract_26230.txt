BACKGROUND
paraxial protocadherin  plays a crucial role in morphogenetic movements during gastrulation and somitogenesis in mouse, zebrafish and xenopus. papc influences cell-cell adhesion mediated by c-cadherin. a putative direct adhesion activity of papc is discussed. papc also promotes cell elongation, tissue separation and coordinates cell mass movements. in these processes the signaling function of papc in activating rhoa/jnk and supporting wnt-11/pcp by binding to frizzled  <dig>  is important.


RESULTS
here we demonstrate by loss of function experiments in xenopus embryos that papc regulates another type of morphogenetic movement, the invagination of the ear placode. knockdown of papc by antisense morpholinos results in deformation of the otic vesicle without altering otocyst marker expression. depletion of papc could be rescued by full-length papc, constitutive active rhoa and by the closely related pcns but not by classical cadherins. also the cytoplasmic deletion mutant m-papc, which influences cell adhesion, does not rescue the papc knockdown. interestingly, depletion of wnt5a or ror <dig> which are also expressed in the otocyst phenocopies the papc morphant phenotype.


CONCLUSIONS
papc signaling via rhoa and wnt5a/ror <dig> activity are required to keep cells aligned in apical-basal orientation during invagination of the ear placode. since neither the cytoplasmic deletion mutant m-papc nor a classical cadherin is able to rescue loss of papc we suggest that the signaling function of the protocadherin rather than its role as modulator of cell-cell adhesion is required during invagination of the ear placode.
