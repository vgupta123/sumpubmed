BACKGROUND
apoptosis is a highly controlled process of cell death that can be induced by periodontopathogens. the present study aimed to investigate the expression of fas and bcl- <dig> proteins by cd3+ t cells in vitro under stimulation by total porphyromonas gingivalis antigens and purified recombinant p. gingivalis hmuy protein.


RESULTS
cd3+ t cells derived from cp patients and stimulated with hmuy expressed higher levels of bcl- <dig> compared to identical cells stimulated with p. gingivalis crude extract or cells derived from np control subjects .


CONCLUSIONS
the authors hypothesize that p. gingivalis hmuy plays a role in the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis, possibly by reducing or delaying apoptosis in t cells through a pathway involving the bcl- <dig> protein.
