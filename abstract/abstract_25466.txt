BACKGROUND
variability of heading date may assist in wheat adaptation to local environments. thereafter, discovery of new heading date determinants is important for cereal improvement. in this study we used common wheat cultivar chinese spring  and the substitution line of cs with 5b chromosome from t. dicoccoides , different in their heading date by two weeks, to detect determinants of heading date on 5b chromosome.


RESULTS
the possible influence of the vrn-b <dig> gene, the most powerful regulator of flowering, located on 5b chromosome, to differences in heading time between cs and cs-5bdic was studied. the sequencing of this gene from cs-5bdic showed that an insertion of a nucleotide triplet produced an additional amino acid in the corresponding protein. no changes in the transcription levels of each homoeologous vrn- <dig> loci were found in cs-5bdic by comparison with cs. to ascertain the loci determining heading date difference, a set of  <dig> recombinant inbred 5В chromosomal lines as a result of hybridization of cs with cs-5bdic were developed and their heading dates were estimated. using the illumina infinium 15 k wheat platform,  <dig> 5b-specific polymorphic markers were detected and a genetic map with  <dig> skeletal markers was constructed. phenotype  – genotype association analysis revealed seventy eight markers in pericentromeric region of 5b chromosome significantly associated with heading date variation. based on this estimation and synteny with model crop genomes we identified the three best candidate genes: wrky, erf/ap <dig> and fhy3/far <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we supposed that the difference in activity of wrky, erf/ap <dig> and/or fhy3/far <dig> transcription factors between cs and cs-5bdic to be a probable reason for the observed difference in heading dates. data obtained in this study provide a good basis for the subsequent investigation of heading time pathways in wheat.
