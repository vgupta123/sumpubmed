BACKGROUND
bifidobacteria constitute a specific group of commensal bacteria that commonly inhabit the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. bifidobacterium breve ucc <dig> was previously shown to utilize a variety of plant/diet/host-derived carbohydrates, including cellodextrin, starch and galactan, as well as the mucin and hmo-derived monosaccharide, sialic acid. in the current study, we investigated the ability of this strain to utilize parts of a host-derived source of carbohydrate, namely the mucin glycoprotein, when grown in co-culture with the mucin-degrading bifidobacterium bifidum prl <dig> 


RESULTS
b. breve ucc <dig> was shown to exhibit growth properties in a mucin-based medium, but only when grown in the presence of b. bifidum prl <dig>  which is known to metabolize mucin. a combination of hpaec-pad and transcriptome analyses identified some of the possible monosaccharides and oligosaccharides which support this enhanced co-cultivation growth/viability phenotype.


CONCLUSIONS
this study describes the potential existence of a gut commensal relationship between two bifidobacterial species. we demonstrate the in vitro ability of b. breve ucc <dig> to cross-feed on sugars released by the mucin-degrading activity of b. bifidum prl <dig>  thus advancing our knowledge on the metabolic adaptability which allows the former strain to colonize the  gut by its extensive metabolic abilities to utilize available carbohydrate sources.
