BACKGROUND
excess light conditions induce the generation of reactive oxygen species  directly in the chloroplasts but also cause an accumulation and production of ros in peroxisomes, cytosol and vacuoles. antioxidants such as ascorbate and glutathione occur in all cell compartments where they detoxify ros. in this study compartment specific changes in antioxidant levels and related enzymes were monitored among arabidopsis wildtype plants and ascorbate and glutathione deficient mutants  exposed to different light intensities  for 4Â h and  <dig> d.


RESULTS
the results revealed that wildtype plants reacted to short term exposure to excess light conditions with the accumulation of ascorbate and glutathione in chloroplasts, peroxisomes and the cytosol and an increased activity of catalase in the leaves. long term exposure led to an accumulation of ascorbate and glutathione mainly in chloroplasts. in wildtype plants an accumulation of ascorbate and hydrogen peroxide  could be observed in vacuoles when exposed to high light conditions. the pad2- <dig> mutant reacted to long term excess light exposure with an accumulation of ascorbate in peroxisomes whereas the vtc2- <dig> mutant reacted with an accumulation of glutathione in the chloroplasts  and nuclei during long term high light conditions indicating an important role of these antioxidants in these cell compartments for the protection of the mutants against high light stress.


CONCLUSIONS
the results obtained in this study demonstrate that the accumulation of ascorbate and glutathione in chloroplasts, peroxisomes and the cytosol is an important reaction of plants to short term high light stress. the accumulation of ascorbate and h2o <dig> along the tonoplast and in vacuoles during these conditions indicates an important route for h2o <dig> detoxification under these conditions.
