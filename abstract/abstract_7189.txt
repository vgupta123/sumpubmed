BACKGROUND
tho  complex  <dig> , an mrna export protein, is involved in the expression of only 1% of all genes. using an interferon inducible knockout mouse system, we have previously shown that thoc <dig> is an essential element in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells and cytokine-mediated hematopoiesis in adult mice. here we interrogate thoc <dig> function in cell differentiation beyond the hematopoietic system and study pathological changes caused by thoc <dig> deficiency.


RESULTS
to examine whether thoc <dig> plays a role in general differentiation processes, we generated tamoxifen inducible thoc <dig> knockout mice. we show here that the depletion of thoc <dig> impaired not only hematopoietic differentiation, but also differentiation and self renewal of the gut epithelium. depletion of the thoc <dig> gene did not cause pathological alterations in liver or kidney.

we further show that thoc <dig> is indispensable for processing of mrnas induced by wnt  signaling which play key roles in epithelial cell differentiation/proliferation. a subset of wnt target mrnas, sry-box containing gene  <dig> , and achaete-scute complex homolog  <dig> , but not fibronectin  <dig> , were down-regulated in thoc <dig> knockout intestinal cells. the down-regulated wnt target mrnas were able to bind to thoc <dig>  furthermore, pathological alterations in the gastrointestinal tract induced translocation of intestinal bacteria and caused sepsis in mice. the bacteria translocation may cause toll-like receptor activation. we identified one of the toll-like receptor inducible genes, prostaglandin-endoperoxidase synthase  <dig>  transcript as thoc <dig> target mrna.


CONCLUSIONS
thoc <dig> is indispensable for processing of only a subset of mrnas, but plays a key role in processing of mrnas inducible by wnt signals. furthermore, thoc <dig> is dispensable for general mrna export in terminally differentiated organs, indicating that multiple mrna export pathways exist. these data imply that thoc <dig> may be a useful tool for studying intestinal stem cells, for modifying the differentiation processes and for cancer therapy.
