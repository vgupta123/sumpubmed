BACKGROUND
up to now, two loci have been involved in xx sex-reversal in mammals following loss-of-function mutations, pis  in goats and r-spondin <dig>  in humans. here, we analyze the possible interaction between these two factors during goat gonad development. furthermore, since functional redundancy between different r-spondins may influence gonad development, we also studied the expression patterns of rspo <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 


RESULTS
similarly to the mouse, rspo <dig> shows a sex-dimorphic expression pattern during goat gonad development with higher levels in the ovaries. interestingly, the pis mutation does not seem to influence its level of expression. moreover, using an rspo <dig> specific antibody, the rspo <dig> protein was localized in the cortical area of early differentiating ovaries . this cortical area contains the majority of germ cell that are surrounded by foxl <dig> negative somatic cells. at latter stages  rspo <dig> protein remains specifically localized on the germ cell membranes. interestingly, a time-specific relocation of rspo <dig> on the germ cell membrane was noticed, moving from a uniform distribution at  <dig> dpc to a punctuated staining before and during meiosis . interestingly, also rspo <dig> and rspo <dig> show a sex-dimorphic expression pattern with higher levels in the ovaries. although rspo <dig> was found to be faintly and belatedly expressed, the expression of rspo <dig> increases at the crucial  <dig> dpc stage, as does that of foxl <dig>  importantly, rspo <dig> expression appears dramatically decreased in xx pis-/- gonads at all three tested stages .


CONCLUSIONS
during goat ovarian development, the pattern of expression of rspo <dig> is in agreement with its possible anti-testis function but is not influenced by the pis mutation. moreover, our data suggest that rspo <dig> may be associated with germ cell development and meiosis. interestingly, another rspo gene, rspo <dig> shows a sex-dimorphic pattern of expression that is dramatically influenced by the pis mutation.
