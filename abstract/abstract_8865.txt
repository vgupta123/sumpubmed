BACKGROUND
all vertebrates initially feed their offspring using yolk reserves. in some live-bearing species these yolk reserves may be supplemented with extra nutrition via a placenta. sharks belonging to the carcharhinidae family are all live-bearing, and with the exception of the tiger shark , develop placental connections after exhausting yolk reserves. phylogenetic relationships suggest the lack of placenta in tiger sharks is due to secondary loss. this represents a dramatic shift in reproductive strategy, and is likely to have left a molecular footprint of positive selection within the genome.


RESULTS
we sequenced the transcriptome of the tiger shark and eight other live-bearing shark species. from this data we constructed a time-calibrated phylogenetic tree estimating the tiger shark lineage diverged from the placental carcharhinids approximately  <dig> million years ago. along the tiger shark lineage, we identified five genes exhibiting a signature of positive selection. four of these genes have functions likely associated with brain development  and sexual reproduction .


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate the loss of placenta in tiger sharks may be associated with subsequent adaptive changes in brain development and sperm production.
