BACKGROUND
in humans, mutation of elac <dig> is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. elac <dig> has been shown to have trnase z activity and is associated with the Î³-tubulin complex.


RESULTS
in this work, we show that the yeast homolog of elac <dig>  encoded by trz <dig> , is involved genetically in rna processing. the temperature sensitivity of a trz <dig> mutant can be rescued by multiple copies of rex <dig>  which encodes a protein with rna 3' processing activity, suggesting a role of trz1p in rna processing in vivo. trz1p has two putative nucleotide triphosphate-binding motifs  and a conserved histidine motif. the histidine motif and the putative nucleotide binding motif at the c-domain are important for trz1p function because mutant proteins bearing changes to the critical residues in these motifs are unable to rescue deletion of trz <dig>  the growth defect exhibited by trz <dig> yeast is not complemented by the heterologous elac <dig>  suggesting that trz1p may have additional functions in yeast.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide genetic evidence that prostate cancer susceptibility gene elac <dig> may be involved in rna processing, especially rrna processing and mitochondrial function.
