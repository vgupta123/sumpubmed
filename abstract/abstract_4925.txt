BACKGROUND
next generation sequencing  is producing enormous corpuses of short dna reads, affecting emerging fields like metagenomics. protein similarity search--a key step to achieve annotation of protein-coding genes in these short reads, and identification of their biological functions--faces daunting challenges because of the very sizes of the short read datasets.


RESULTS
we developed a fast protein similarity search tool rapsearch that utilizes a reduced amino acid alphabet and suffix array to detect seeds of flexible length. for short reads  we tested, rapsearch achieved ~20- <dig> times speedup as compared to blastx. rapsearch missed only a small fraction  of blastx similarity hits, but it also discovered additional homologous proteins  that blastx missed. by contrast, blat, a tool that is even slightly faster than rapsearch, had significant loss of sensitivity as compared to rapsearch and blast.


CONCLUSIONS
rapsearch is implemented as open-source software and is accessible at http://omics.informatics.indiana.edu/mg/rapsearch. it enables faster protein similarity search. the application of rapsearch in metageomics has also been demonstrated.
