BACKGROUND
previous genome-wide association analyses identified qtl regions in the x chromosome for percentage of normal sperm and scrotal circumference in brahman and tropical composite cattle. these traits are important to be studied because they are indicators of male fertility and are correlated with female sexual precocity and reproductive longevity. the aim was to investigate candidate genes in these regions and to identify putative causative mutations that influence these traits. in addition, we tested the identified mutations for female fertility and growth traits.


RESULTS
using a combination of bioinformatics and molecular assay technology, twelve non-synonymous snps in eleven genes were genotyped in a cattle population. three and nine snps explained more than 1% of the additive genetic variance for percentage of normal sperm and scrotal circumference, respectively. the snps that had a major influence in percentage of normal sperm were mapped to loc <dig> and taf7l genes; and in tex <dig> and ar genes for scrotal circumference. one snp in tex <dig> was explained ~13% of the additive genetic variance for scrotal circumference at 12 months. the tested snp were also associated with weight measurements, but not with female fertility traits.


CONCLUSIONS
the strong association of snps located in x chromosome genes with male fertility traits validates the qtl. the implicated genes became good candidates to be used for genetic evaluation, without detrimentally influencing female fertility traits.
