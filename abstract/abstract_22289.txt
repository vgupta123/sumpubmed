BACKGROUND
tomato  and potato  are two economically important crop species, the genomes of which are currently being sequenced. this study presents a first genome-wide analysis of these two species, based on two large collections of bac end sequences representing approximately 19% of the tomato genome and 10% of the potato genome.


RESULTS
the tomato genome has a higher repeat content than the potato genome, primarily due to a higher number of retrotransposon insertions in the tomato genome. on the other hand, simple sequence repeats are more abundant in potato than in tomato. the two genomes also differ in the frequency distribution of ssr motifs. based on est and protein alignments, potato appears to contain up to  <dig>  more putative coding regions than tomato. major gene families such as cytochrome p <dig> mono-oxygenases and serine-threonine protein kinases are significantly overrepresented in potato, compared to tomato. moreover, the p <dig> superfamily appears to have expanded spectacularly in both species compared to arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting an expanded network of secondary metabolic pathways in the solanaceae. both tomato and potato appear to have a low level of microsynteny with a. thaliana. a higher degree of synteny was observed with populus trichocarpa, specifically in the region between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb on p. trichocarpa chromosome  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the findings in this paper present a first glimpse into the evolution of solanaceous genomes, both within the family and relative to other plant species. when the complete genome sequences of these species become available, whole-genome comparisons and protein- or repeat-family specific studies may shed more light on the observations made here.
