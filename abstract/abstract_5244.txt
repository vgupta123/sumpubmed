BACKGROUND
it is well known that the c-terminal zinc-finger- <dig> in transcription factor sp <dig> contributes more than the n-terminal zinc-finger- <dig> in determining sp1’s dna binding capacity. sp1-like artificial poly-zinc-finger proteins  are powerful biotechnological tools for gene-specific recognization and manipulation. it is important to understand whether the c-terminal fingers in the sp1-like artificial zfps remain crucial for their dna binding ability. recently, a set of p <dig> promoter-specific seven-zfps  has been constructed to reactivate the expression of methylation-silenced p <dig>  these 7zfps contain one n-terminal three-zinc-finger domain of sp <dig> , two sp1-like two-zinc-finger domains derived from the sp <dig> finger- <dig> and finger- <dig>  in the middle and c-terminal regions.


RESULTS
in the present study, sets of variants for several representative 7zfps with the p16-binding affinity were further constructed. this was accomplished through finger replacements and key amino acid mutations in the n-terminal fingers, c-terminal fingers, and linker peptide, respectively. their p16-binding activity was analysed using gel mobility shift assays. results showed that the motif replacement or a key amino acid mutation  at position + <dig> of the α-helix in the c-terminal 2zf domain completely abolished their p16-binding affinity. deletion of three amino acids in a consensus linker  between finger- <dig> and the  <dig> × histidine-tag in the c-terminal also dramatically abolished their binding affinity. in contrast, the replacement of the finger- <dig> in the n-terminal 3zf domain did not affect their binding affinity, but decreased their binding stability.


CONCLUSIONS
altogether, the present study show that the c-terminal region may play crucial roles in determining the dna binding affinity of sp1-like artificial zfps.
