BACKGROUND
the unique properties of wheat flour primarily depend on gluten, which is the most important source of protein for human being. γ-gliadins have been considered to be the most ancient of the wheat gluten family. the complex family structure of γ-gliadins complicates the determination of their function. moreover, γ-gliadins contain several sets of celiac disease epitopes. however, no systematic research has been conducted yet.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> γ-gliadin genes were isolated from common wheat and its closely related species, among which  <dig> sequences are putatively functional. the orf lengths of these sequences range from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, and the repetitive region is mainly responsible for the size heterogeneity of γ-gliadins. the repeat motif pfpq1–2qq)1–2is repeated from  <dig> to  <dig> times. sequence polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium analyses show that γ-gliadins are highly diverse. phylogenic analyses indicate that there is no obvious discrimination between sitopsis and ae. tauschii at the gli- <dig> loci, compared with diploid wheat. according to the number and placement of cysteine residues, we defined nine cysteine patterns and  <dig> subgroups. alternatively, we classified γ-gliadins into two types based on the length of repetitive domain. amino acid composition analyses indicate that there is a wide range of essential amino acids in γ-gliadins, and those γ-gliadins from subgroup sg- <dig> and sg- <dig> and γ-gliadins with a short repetitive domain are more nutritional. a screening of toxic epitopes shows that γ-gliadins with a pattern of c <dig> and γ-gliadins with a short repetitive domain almost lack any epitopes.


CONCLUSIONS
γ-gliadin sequences in wheat and closely related aegilops species are diverse. each group/subgroup contributes differently to nutritional quality and epitope content. it is suggested that the genes with a short repetitive domain are more nutritional and valuable. therefore, it is possible to breed wheat varieties, the γ-gliadins of which are less, even non-toxic and more nutritional.
