BACKGROUND
type  <dig> diabetes is an autoimmune disease caused by t cell-mediated destruction of the insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreas. therefore, approaches that effectively halt the pathogenic t cell response are predicted to have preventive or therapeutic benefit for type  <dig> diabetes patients. we previously demonstrated that long-term blocking of il- <dig> signaling, which is critical for the survival and function of t cells, prevented and reversed type  <dig> diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice. however, such persistent inhibition of t cell responses raises concerns about causing immunodeficiency. here, we asked whether a reduced duration of the treatment with anti-il-7rα antibodies retained efficacy in preventing diabetes. moreover, we sought to identify immunoregulatory mechanisms induced by anti-il-7rα administration.


RESULTS
anti-il-7rα antibodies were administered to prediabetic nod mice for 3 weeks and blood samples were taken at the end of treatment and 2 weeks later to analyze changes in t cell phenotypes in response to il-7rα blockade. we found that the co-inhibitory receptors lag- <dig>  tim- <dig> and pd- <dig> were increased on peripheral blood cd4+ and cd8+ t cells from anti-il-7rα-treated mice. expression of these receptors contributed to reduced t cell cytokine production in response to tcr stimulation. in addition, the frequency of tregs within the circulating cd4+ t cells was increased at the end of anti-il-7rα antibody treatment and these tregs showed a more activated phenotype. in vitro restimulation assays revealed that effector t cells from anti-il-7rα-treated mice were more sensitive to co-inhibitory receptor induction after tcr stimulation. importantly, these changes were accompanied by delayed type  <dig> diabetes disease kinetics.


CONCLUSIONS
together, our data show that short-term blockade of il-7rα induces detectable changes in co-inhibitory receptor expression and treg frequencies in peripheral blood of nod mice. these changes appear to have long-lasting effects by delaying or preventing type  <dig> diabetes incidence. hence, our study provides further support for using anti-il-7rα antibodies to modulate autoreactive t cell responses.
