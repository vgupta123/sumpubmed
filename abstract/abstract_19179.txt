BACKGROUND
tumor angiogenesis is critical for tumor growth, infiltration and metastasis. vascular endothelial growth factor  is a potent angiogenic factor and targeting it is important in reducing angiogenesis. bevacizumab , a monoclonal antibody that reacts directly against vegf, has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for various cancers such as rectal cancer, colon carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer, etc.


RESULTS
in the current study, we used the phage display technique to generate mimotopes that complemented the screening avastin antibody . the candidate mimotopes of vegf were isolated from a 12-mer peptide library. the phage displaying peptide dhtlytpyhthp  exhibited high affinity to avastin. the chemically synthesized 12p was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin  by glutaraldehyde  to form vaccine klh- <dig> peptide . this epitope vaccine significantly induced humoral immunity in mice. the blood serum from klh-12p-immunized mice associated with vegf and blocked its binding to vegfr, thus inhibiting vascular endothelial cell proliferation and migration.


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that the isolated mimotope 12p reported here could potentially elicit specific antibodies against vegf and result in the induction of anti-angiogenesis responses.
