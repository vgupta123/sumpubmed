BACKGROUND
micrornas  are implicated in plant development processes and play pivotal roles in plant adaptation to environmental stresses. salicornia europaea, a salt mash euhalophyte, is a suitable model plant to study salt adaptation mechanisms. s. europaea is also a vegetable, forage, and oilseed that can be used for saline land reclamation and biofuel precursor production on marginal lands. despite its importance, no mirna has been identified from s. europaea thus far.


RESULTS
deep sequencing was performed to investigate small rna transcriptome of s. europaea. two hundred and ten conserved mirnas comprising  <dig> families and  <dig> novel mirnas  belonging to  <dig> families were identified. about half  of the novel mirnas were only detected in salt-treated samples. the expression of  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel mirnas significantly changed in response to salinity. in addition,  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel mirnas were differentially expressed between the shoots and roots. furthermore,  <dig> and  <dig> s. europaea unigenes were predicted to be targets of  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel mirna families, respectively. these targets encoded a wide range of proteins, and genes involved in transcription regulation constituted the largest category. four of these genes encoding laccase, f-box family protein, sac3/ganp family protein, and nadph cytochrome p- <dig> reductase were validated using 5′-race.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that specific mirnas are tightly regulated by salinity in the shoots and/or roots of s. europaea, which may play important roles in salt tolerance of this euhalophyte. the s. europaea salt-responsive mirnas and mirnas that target transcription factors, nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat proteins and enzymes involved in lignin biosynthesis as well as carbon and nitrogen metabolism may be applied in genetic engineering of crops with high stress tolerance, and genetic modification of biofuel crops with high biomass and regulatable lignin biosynthesis.
