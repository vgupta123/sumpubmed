BACKGROUND
effective improvement in sorghum crop development necessitates a genomics-based approach to identify functional genes and qtls. sequenced in  <dig>  a comprehensive annotation of the sorghum genome and the development of functional genomics resources is key to enable the discovery and deployment of regulatory and metabolic genes and gene networks for crop improvement.


RESULTS
this study utilizes the first commercially available whole-transcriptome sorghum microarray  to identify tissue and genotype-specific expression patterns for all identified sorghum bicolor exons and utrs. the genechip contains  <dig> , <dig> probes covering  <dig>  exons  across the sorghum bicolor nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial genomes. specific probesets were also included for putative non-coding rnas that may play a role in gene regulation , and confirmed functional small rnas in related species  were also included in our array design. we generated expression data for  <dig> samples with a combination of four different tissue types , two dissected stem tissues  and six diverse genotypes, which included  <dig> public sorghum lines  representing grain, sweet, forage, and high biomass ideotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
here we present a summary of the microarray dataset, including analysis of tissue-specific gene expression profiles and associated expression profiles of relevant metabolic pathways. with an aim to enable identification and functional characterization of genes in sorghum, this expression atlas presents a new and valuable resource to the research community.
