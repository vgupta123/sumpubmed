BACKGROUND
previous studies showed that anodal transcranial dc stimulation  applied to the primary motor cortex of the affected hemisphere  after subcortical stroke transiently improves performance of complex tasks that mimic activities of daily living . it is not known if relatively simpler motor tasks are similarly affected. here we tested the effects of tdcs on pinch force  and simple reaction time  tasks in patients with chronic stroke in a double-blind cross-over sham-controlled experimental design.


RESULTS
anodal tdcs shortened reaction times and improved pinch force in the paretic hand relative to sham stimulation, an effect present in patients with higher impairment.


CONCLUSIONS
tdcs of m1affected hemisphere can modulate performance of motor tasks simpler than those previously studied, a finding that could potentially benefit patients with relatively higher impairment levels.
