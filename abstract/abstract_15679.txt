BACKGROUND
 <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin  is an environmental contaminant that elicits a broad spectrum of toxic effects in a species-specific manner. current risk assessment practices routinely extrapolate results from in vivo and in vitro rodent models to assess human risk. in order to further investigate the species-specific responses elicited by tcdd, temporal gene expression responses in human hepg <dig>  mouse hepa1c1c <dig> and rat h4iie cells were compared.


RESULTS
microarray analysis identified a core set of conserved gene expression responses across species consistent with the role of ahr in mediating adaptive metabolic responses. however, significant species-specific as well as species-divergent responses were identified. computational analysis of the regulatory regions of species-specific and -divergent responses suggests that dioxin response elements  are involved. these results are consistent with in vivo rat vs. mouse species-specific differential gene expression, and more comprehensive comparative dre searches.


CONCLUSIONS
comparative analysis of human hepg <dig>  mouse hepa1c1c <dig> and rat h4iie tcdd-elicited gene expression responses is consistent with in vivo rat-mouse comparative gene expression studies, and more comprehensive comparative dre searches, suggesting that ahr-mediated gene expression is species-specific.
