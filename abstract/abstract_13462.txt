BACKGROUND
the development of single-cell rna sequencing has enabled profound discoveries in biology, ranging from the dissection of the composition of complex tissues to the identification of novel cell types and dynamics in some specialized cellular environments. however, the large-scale generation of single-cell rna-seq  data collected at multiple time points remains a challenge to effective measurement gene expression patterns in transcriptome analysis.


RESULTS
we present an algorithm based on the dynamic time warping score  combined with time-series data, that enables the detection of gene expression changes across scrna-seq samples and recovery of potential cell types from complex mixtures of multiple cell types.


CONCLUSIONS
the dtwscore successfully classify cells of different types with the most highly variable genes from time-series scrna-seq data. the study was confined to methods that are implemented and available within the r framework. sample datasets and r packages are available at https://github.com/xiaoxiaoxier/dtwscore.
