BACKGROUND
the development of the craniofacial skeleton from embryonic mesenchyme is a complex process that is not yet completely understood, particularly for intramembranous bones. this study investigates the development of the neural crest derived infraorbital  bones of the zebrafish  skull. located under the orbit, the io bones ossify in a set sequence and are closely associated with the lateral line system. we conducted skeletogenic condensation and neuromast laser ablation experiments followed by shape analyses in order to investigate the relationship between a developing io bone and the formation of the io series as well as to investigate the highly debated inductive potential of neuromasts for io ossification.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that when skeletogenic condensations recover from laser ablation, the resulting bone differs in shape compared to controls. interestingly, neighbouring io bones in the bone series are unaffected. in addition, we show that the amount of canal wall mineralization is significantly decreased following neuromast laser ablation at juvenile and larval stages.


CONCLUSIONS
these results highlight the developmental robustness of the io bones and provide direct evidence that canal neuromasts play a role in canal wall development in the head. furthermore, we provide evidence that the io bones may be two distinct developmental modules. the mechanisms underlying developmental robustness are rarely investigated and are important to increase our understanding of evolutionary developmental biology of the vertebrate skull.
