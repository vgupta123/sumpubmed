BACKGROUND
obesity causes insulin resistance in target tissues - skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, liver and the brain. insulin resistance predisposes to type- <dig> diabetes  and cardiovascular disease . adipose tissue inflammation is an essential characteristic of obesity and insulin resistance. neuronatin  expression has been found to be altered in a number of conditions related to inflammatory or metabolic disturbance, but its physiological roles and regulatory mechanisms in adipose tissue, brain, pancreatic islets and other tissues are not understood.


RESULTS
we identified transcription factor binding sites  conserved in the nnat promoter, and transcription factors  abundantly expressed in adipose tissue. these include transcription factors concerned with the control of: adipogenesis ; lipogenesis ; inflammation ; insulin signalling and diabetes susceptibility . we also identified neurod <dig> the only documented tf that controls nnat expression. we identified kegg pathways significantly associated with nnat expression, including positive correlations with inflammation and negative correlations with metabolic pathways  and protein turnover.  <dig> genes, including; gstt <dig> and sod <dig>  concerned with oxidative stress; sncg and cxcl <dig> concerned with inflammation; ebf <dig>  lgals <dig> and fzd <dig> involved in adipogenesis; whose expression co-varies with nnat were identified, and conserved transcription factor binding sites identified on their promoters. functional networks relating to each of these genes were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis shows that nnat is an acute diet-responsive gene in white adipose tissue and hypothalamus; it may play an important role in metabolism, adipogenesis, and resolution of oxidative stress and inflammation in response to dietary excess.
