BACKGROUND
the use of growth-promoters in beef cattle, despite the eu ban, remains a frequent practice. the use of transcriptomic markers has already proposed to identify indirect evidence of anabolic hormone treatment. so far, such approach has been tested in experimentally treated animals. here, for the first time commercial samples were analyzed.


RESULTS
quantitative determination of dexamethasone  residues in the urine collected at the slaughterhouse was performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry . dna-microarray technology was used to obtain transcriptomic profiles of skeletal muscle in commercial samples and negative controls. lc-ms confirmed the presence of low level of dex residues in the urine of the commercial samples suspect for histological classification. principal component analysis  on microarray data identified two clusters of samples. one cluster included negative controls and a subset of commercial samples, while a second cluster included part of the specimens collected at the slaughterhouse together with positives for corticosteroid treatment based on thymus histology and lc-ms. functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes  between the two groups provided further evidence that animals clustering with positive samples might have been treated with corticosteroids. these suspect samples could be reliably classified with a specific classification tool  using just two genes.


CONCLUSIONS
despite broad variation observed in gene expression profiles, the present study showed that dna-microarrays can be used to find transcriptomic signatures of putative anabolic treatments and that gene expression markers could represent a useful screening tool.
