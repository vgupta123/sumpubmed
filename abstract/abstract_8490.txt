BACKGROUND
in oregon, human and animal infections by c. gattii were first identified in  <dig>  cryptococcus gattii is considered to be an emerging non-zoonotic infection affecting animals and humans in oregon. we report a longitudinal environmental isolation of c. gattii after an oregon dog was diagnosed with the disease in  <dig> 


RESULTS
cryptococcus gattii was isolated twice from the same location with a span of one year between isolation dates. cryptococcus gattii molecular types vgiia and vgi were isolated in  <dig> from soil and tree bark near the home of a 9-month-old dog which three months previously had an infection caused by c. gattii genotype vgiia. the environment featured heavy growth of douglas fir trees. in  <dig>  a second set of soil and tree bark samples was collected in the same area and c. gattii vgiia was again identified from the environment, along with genotypes vgiib and vgiic.


CONCLUSIONS
the use of animal surveillance data to identify environmental niches of c. gattii should be considered to expand the understanding of this emerging pathogen. understanding the ecology and how the environment and other factors might modify the existing niches is important for assessing risk and for designing measures to protect human and animal health.
