BACKGROUND
nitric oxide plays an important role in the regulation of male and female sexual behavior in rodents, and the expression of the nitric oxide synthase  is influenced by testosterone in the male rat, and by estrogens in the female. we have here quantitatively investigated the distribution of nnos immunoreactive  neurons in the limbic hypothalamic region of intact female mice sacrificed during different phases of estrous cycle.


RESULTS
changes were observed in the medial preoptic area   and in the arcuate nucleus  . in the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial nucleus  and in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis  no significant changes have been observed. in addition, by comparing males and females, we observed a stable sex dimorphism  in the vmhvl and in the bst . in the mpa and in the arc sex differences were detected only comparing some phases of the cycle.


CONCLUSIONS
these data demonstrate that, in mice, the expression of nnos in some hypothalamic regions involved in the control of reproduction and characterized by a large number of estrogen receptors is under the control of gonadal hormones and may vary according to the rapid variations of hormonal levels that take place during the estrous cycle.
