BACKGROUND
the oncomine™ database is an online collection of microarrays from various sources, usually cancer-related, and contains many "multi-arrays" . as there are often many hundreds of tumour samples/microarrays within a single multi-array results from coexpressed genes can be analyzed, and are fully searchable. this gives a potentially significant list of coexpressed genes, which is important to define pathways in which the gene of interest is involved. however, to increase the likelihood of revealing truly significant coexpressed genes we have analyzed their frequency of occurrence over multiple studies , greatly increasing the significance of results compared to those of a single study.


RESULTS
we have used the dead-box proteins p <dig> and p <dig> as models for this coexpression frequency analysis as there are defined functions for these proteins in splicing and transcription . furthermore, as these proteins are highly similar, interact together, and may be to some degree functionally redundant, we then analyzed the overlap between coexpressed genes of p <dig> and p <dig>  this final analysis gave us a highly significant list of coexpressed genes, clustering mainly in splicing and transcription , but also revealing new pathways such as cytoskeleton remodelling and protein folding. we have further tested a predicted pathway partner, rna helicase a in a reciprocal meta-analysis that identified p <dig> and p <dig> as being coexpressed, and further show a direct interaction of dhx <dig> with p <dig> and p <dig>  attesting to the predictive nature of this technique.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary we have extended the capabilities of oncomine™ by analyzing the frequency of coexpressed genes over multiple studies, and furthermore assessing the overlap with a known pathway partner . we have shown our predictions corroborate previously published studies on p <dig> and p <dig>  and that novel predictions can be easily tested. these techniques are widely applicable and should increase the quality of data from future meta-analysis studies.
