BACKGROUND
a major endogenous protective mechanism in many organs against ischemia/reperfusion  injury is ischemic preconditioning . by moderately uncoupling the mitochondrial respiratory chain and decreasing production of reactive oxygen species , ipc reduces apoptosis induced by i/r by reducing cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. one element believed to contribute to reduce ros production is the uncoupling protein ucp <dig> . although its implication in ipc in the brain has been shown in vitro, no in vivo study of protein has shown its upregulation. our first goal was to determine in rat hippocampus whether ucp <dig> protein upregulation was associated with ipc-induced protection and increased ros production. the second goal was to determine whether the peptide ghrelin, which possesses anti-oxidant and protective properties, alters ucp <dig> mrna levels in the same way as ipc during protection.


RESULTS
after global forebrain ischemia  with  <dig> h reperfusion , we found important neuronal lesion in the rat hippocampal ca <dig> region, which was reduced by a preceding 3-min preconditioning ischemia , whereas the preconditioning stimulus alone  had no effect. compared to control, ucp <dig> protein labelling increased moderately in the i/r  and ipc+i/r  groups, and substantially in the ipc group . treatment with superoxide dismutase  at the time of a preconditioning ischemia greatly attenuated  the increase in ucp <dig> staining at  <dig> h, implying a role of oxygen radicals in ucp <dig> induction.

hippocampal ucp <dig> mrna showed a moderate increase in i/r  and ipc+i/r  groups versus control, and a large increase in the ipc group . in ghrelin experiments, the i/r+ghrelin group  showed considerable protection of ca <dig> neurons versus i/r animals, and increased hippocampal ucp <dig> mrna .


CONCLUSIONS
we confirm that ipc causes increased expression of ucp <dig> protein in vivo, at a moment appropriate for protection against i/r in the hippocampus. the two dissimilar protective strategies, ipc and ghrelin administration, were both associated with upregulated ucp <dig>  suggesting that ucp <dig> may often represent a final common pathway in protection from i/r.
