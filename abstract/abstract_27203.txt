BACKGROUND
micrornas  are short non-coding rna molecules participating in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. there have been many efforts to discover mirna precursors  over the years. recently, ab initio approaches obtain more attention because that they can discover species-specific pre-mirnas. most ab initio approaches proposed novel features to characterize rna molecules. however, there were fewer discussions on the associated classification mechanism in a mirna predictor.


RESULTS
this study focuses on the classification algorithm for mirna prediction. we develop a novel ab initio method, mir-kde, in which most of the features are collected from previous works. the classification mechanism in mir-kde is the relaxed variable kernel density estimator  that we have recently proposed. when compared to the famous support vector machine , rvkde exploits more local information of the training dataset. mir-kde is evaluated using a training set consisted of only human pre-mirnas to predict a benchmark collected from  <dig> species. the experimental results show that mir-kde delivers favorable performance in predicting human pre-mirnas and has advantages for pre-mirnas from the genera taxonomically distant to humans.


CONCLUSIONS
we use a novel classifier of which the characteristic of exploiting local information is particularly suitable to predict species-specific pre-mirnas. this study also provides a comprehensive analysis from the view of classification mechanism. the good performance of mir-kde encourages more efforts on the classification methodology as well as the feature extraction in mirna prediction.
