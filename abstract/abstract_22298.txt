BACKGROUND
l--tartaric acid  is an important organic acid, which is produced from the cream of tartar or stereospecific hydrolysis of the cis-epoxysuccinate. the former method is limited by the availability of raw material and the latter is dependent on the petrochemical material. thus, new processes for the economical preparation of l-ta from carbohydrate or renewable resource would be much more attractive. production of 5-keto-d-gluconate  from glucose by gluconobacter oxydans is the first step to produce l-ta. the aim of this work is to enhance 5-kga accumulation using combinatorial metabolic engineering strategies in g. oxydans. the sldab gene, encoding sorbitol dehydrogenase, was overexpressed in an industrial strain g. oxydans zju <dig> under a carefully selected promoter, p <dig>  to enhance the efficiency of the oxidation by sldab, the coenzyme pyrroloquinoline quinone  and respiratory chain were engineered. besides, the role in sldab overexpression, coenzyme and respiratory chain engineering and their subsequent effects on 5-kga production were investigated.


RESULTS
an efficient, stable recombinant strain was constructed, whereas the 5-kga production could be enhanced. by self-overexpressing the sldab gene in g. oxydans zju <dig> under the constitutive promoter p <dig>  the resulting strain, g. oxydans zju <dig>  produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l of 5-kga. furthermore, through the coenzyme and respiratory chain engineering, the titer and productivity of 5-kga reached  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l and  <dig>  g/, respectively, in a 15 l fermenter. it could be further improved the 5-kga titer by  <dig>  % through the fed-batch fermentation under the ph shift and dissolved oxygen tension  control condition, obtained 162 ±  <dig>  g/l with the productivity of  <dig>  g/ within 64 h.


CONCLUSIONS
the 5-kga production could be significantly enhanced with the combinatorial metabolic engineering strategy in gluconobacter strain, including sldab overexpression, coenzyme and respiratory chain engineering. fed-batch fermentation could further enlarge the positive effect and increase the 5-kga production. all of these demonstrated that the robust recombinant strain can efficiently produce 5-kga in larger scale to fulfill the industrial production of l-ta from 5-kga.
