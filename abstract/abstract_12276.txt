BACKGROUND
real-time quantitative pcr  is a method for rapid and reliable quantification of mrna transcription. internal standards such as reference genes are used to normalise mrna levels between different samples for an exact comparison of mrna transcription level. selection of high quality reference genes is of crucial importance for the interpretation of data generated by real-time qpcr.


RESULTS
in this study nine commonly used reference genes were investigated in  <dig> different pig tissues using real-time qpcr with sybr green. the genes included beta-actin , beta-2-microglobulin , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , hydroxymethylbilane synthase , hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase  <dig> , ribosomal protein l <dig> , succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit a , tata box binding protein and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein zeta polypeptide . the stability of these reference genes in different pig tissues was investigated using the genorm application. the range of expression stability in the genes analysed was : actb/rpl <dig>  tbp, hprt, hmbs, ywhaz, sdha, b2m and gapdh.


CONCLUSIONS
expression stability varies greatly between genes. actb, rpl <dig>  tpb and hprt <dig> were found to have the highest stability across tissues. based on both expression stability and expression level, our data suggest that actb and rpl <dig> are good reference genes for high abundant transcripts while tpb and hprt <dig> are good reference genes for low abundant transcripts in expression studies across different pig tissues.
