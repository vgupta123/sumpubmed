BACKGROUND
discovery of tumor-selective antibodies or antibody fragments is a promising approach for delivering therapeutic agents to antigen over-expressing cancers. therefore it is important to develop methods for the identification of target- and function specific antibodies for effective drug delivery. here we describe a highly selective and sensitive method for characterizing the internalizing potential of multivalently displayed antibodies or ligands conjugated to liposomes into tumor cells. the assay requires minute amounts of histidine-tagged ligand and relies on the non-covalent coupling of these antibodies to fluorescent liposomes containing a metal ion-chelating lipid. following incubation of cells with antibody-conjugated liposomes, surface bound liposomes are gently removed and the remaining internalized liposomes are quantitated based on fluorescence in a high throughput manner. we have termed this methodology "chelated ligand internalization assay", or clia.


RESULTS
the specificity of the assay was demonstrated with different antibodies to the erbb- <dig> and egf receptors. antibody-uptake correlated with receptor expression levels in tumor cell lines with a range of receptor expression. furthermore, ni-nta liposomes containing doxorubicin were used to screen for the ability of antibodies to confer target-specific cytotoxicity. using an anti-erbb <dig> single chain fv   antibody, cytotoxicity could be conferred to erbb2-overexpressing cells; however, a poly-linked lipid  was necessary to allow for efficient loading of the drug and to reduce nonspecific drug leakage during the course of the assay.


CONCLUSIONS
the clia method we describe here represents a rapid, sensitive and robust assay for the identification and characterization of tumor-specific antibodies capable of high drug-delivery efficiency when conjugated to liposomal nanocarriers.
