BACKGROUND
although methods based on highly abstract descriptions of protein structures, such as vast and tops, can perform very fast protein structure comparison, the results can lack a high degree of biological significance. previously we have discussed the basic mechanisms of our novel method for structure comparison based on our tops+ model . in this paper we show how these results can be significantly improved using parameter optimization, and we call the resulting optimised tops+ method as advanced tops+ comparison method i.e. advtops+.


RESULTS
we have developed a tops+ string model as an improvement to the tops  <cit>  graph model by considering loops as secondary structure elements  in addition to helices and strands, representing ligands as first class objects, and describing interactions between sses, and sses and ligands, by incoming and outgoing arcs, annotating sses with the interaction direction and type. benchmarking results of an all-against-all pairwise comparison using a large dataset of  <dig>  non-redundant structures from the pdb <dig> dataset  <cit>  demonstrate the biological significance, in terms of scop classification at the superfamily level, of our tops+ comparison method.


CONCLUSIONS
our advanced tops+ comparison shows better performance on the pdb <dig> dataset  <cit>  compared to our basic tops+ method, giving 90% accuracy for scop alpha+beta; a 6% increase in accuracy compared to the tops and basic tops+ methods. it also outperforms the tops, basic tops+ and ssap comparison methods on the chew-kedem dataset  <cit> , achieving 98% accuracy.
