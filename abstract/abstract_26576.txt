BACKGROUND
hfq is an rna chaperone protein that has been broadly implicated in srna function in bacteria. here we describe the construction and characterization of a null allele of the gene that encodes the rna chaperone hfq in shewanella oneidensis strain mr- <dig>  a dissimilatory metal reducing bacterium.


RESULTS
loss of hfq in s. oneidensis results in a variety of mutant phenotypes, all of which are fully complemented by addition of a plasmid-borne copy of the wild type hfq gene. aerobic cultures of the hfq∆  mutant grow more slowly through exponential phase than wild type cultures, and hfq∆  cultures reach a terminal cell density in stationary phase that is ~2/ <dig> of that observed in wild type cultures. we have observed a similar growth phenotype when the hfq∆  mutant is cultured under anaerobic conditions with fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor, and we have found that the hfq∆  mutant is defective in cr reduction. finally, the hfq∆  mutant exhibits a striking loss of colony forming units in extended stationary phase and is highly sensitive to oxidative stress induced by h2o <dig> or methyl viologen .


CONCLUSIONS
the hfq mutant in s. oneidensis exhibits pleiotropic phenotypes, including a defect in metal reduction. our results also suggest that hfq mutant phenotypes in s. oneidensis may be at least partially due to increased sensitivity to oxidative stress.
