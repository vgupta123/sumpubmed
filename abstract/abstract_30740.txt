BACKGROUND
daily and seasonal changes in temperature are challenges that fish within aquaculture settings cannot completely avoid, and are known to elicit complex organismal and cellular stress responses. we conducted a large-scale gene discovery and transcript expression study in order to better understand the genes that are potentially involved in the physiological and cellular aspects of stress caused by heat-shock. we used suppression subtractive hybridization  cdna library construction and characterization to identify transcripts that were dysregulated by heat-shock in liver, skeletal muscle and head kidney of atlantic cod. these tissues were selected due to their roles in metabolic regulation, locomotion and growth, and immune function, respectively. fish were exposed for  <dig> hours to an 8°c elevation in temperature, and then allowed to recover for  <dig> hours at the original temperature . tissue samples obtained before heat-shock , at the cessation of heat-shock , and  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours after the cessation of heat-shock , were used for reciprocal ssh library construction and quantitative reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction  analysis of gene expression using samples from a group that was transferred but not heat-shocked  as controls.


RESULTS
we sequenced and characterized  <dig> ests  from three "forward subtracted" libraries  and  <dig> from the liver "reverse subtracted" library , for a total of  <dig> ests. several cdnas encoding putative chaperones belonging to the heat-shock protein  family were found in these libraries, and "protein folding" was among the gene ontology  terms with the highest proportion in the libraries. qpcr analysis of hsp90α and hsp70- <dig>  mrna expression showed significant up-regulation in all three tissues studied. these transcripts were more than 100-fold up-regulated in liver following heat-shock. we also identified hsp <dig>  grp <dig> and grp94-like transcripts, which were significantly up-regulated in all  <dig> tissues studied. toll-like receptor  <dig>  transcript, found in the liver reverse ssh library, was shown by qpcr to be significantly down-regulated in the head kidney after heat-shock.


CONCLUSIONS
chaperones are an important part of the cellular response to stress, and genes identified in this work may play important roles in resistance to thermal-stress. moreover, the transcript for one key immune response gene  was down-regulated by heat-shock, and this down-regulation may be a component of heat-induced immunosuppression.
