BACKGROUND
ccl <dig> is a chemokine predominantly expressed in the liver, but is also found in the blood and brain, and is known to play important roles in immune response and angiogenesis. little is known about the gene’s regulation.

methods
here, we test for potential causal snps that affect ccl <dig> protein levels in both blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid in a genome-wide association study across two datasets. we then use metal to performed meta-analyses with a significance threshold of p < 5x10− <dig>  we removed snps where the direction of the effect was different between the two datasets.


RESULTS
we identify  <dig> snps associated with increased ccl <dig> protein levels in both biological fluids.


CONCLUSIONS
our results will help understand ccl16’s regulation, allowing researchers to better understand the gene’s effects on human health.
