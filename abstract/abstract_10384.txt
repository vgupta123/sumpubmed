BACKGROUND
sesame is an important oil crop, but limited transcriptomic and genomic data are currently available. this information is essential to clarify the fatty acid and lignan biosynthesis molecular mechanism. in addition, a shortage of sesame molecular markers limits the efficiency and accuracy of genetic breeding. high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing is essential to generate a large transcriptome sequence dataset for gene discovery and molecular marker development.


RESULTS
sesame transcriptomes from five tissues were sequenced using illumina paired-end sequencing technology. the cleaned raw reads were assembled into a total of  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of  <dig> bp. of the unigenes,  <dig>   had significant similarity with proteins in the ncbi nonredundant protein database and swiss-prot database . of these annotated unigenes,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to gene ontology categories and clusters of orthologous groups, respectively. in total,  <dig>   unigenes were mapped onto  <dig> pathways using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway database . furthermore,  <dig>  unigenes showed homology to  <dig>  arabidopsis genes based on blastx analysis against the arabidopsis information resource  and revealed relatively high gene coverage. in total,  <dig>  unigenes were converted into ssr markers . dinucleotide ssrs were the dominant repeat motif , followed by trinucleotide , tetranucleotide , hexanucleotide , and pentanucleotide  ssrs. ag/ct  was the dominant repeat motif, followed by ac/gt , at/at , aag/ctt , and agg/cct . fifty est-ssrs were randomly selected to validate amplification and to determine the degree of polymorphism in the genomic dna pools. forty primer pairs successfully amplified dna fragments and detected significant amounts of polymorphism among  <dig> sesame accessions.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that illumina paired-end sequencing is a fast and cost-effective approach to gene discovery and molecular marker development in non-model organisms. our results provide a comprehensive sequence resource for sesame research.
