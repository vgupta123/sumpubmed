BACKGROUND
high potential of morus laevigata and morus serrata has been proposed in the breeding programs for morus sp. however, due to the lack of dense molecular markers this goal is still in its nascent stage and not yet realized. we thus, sequenced the transcriptomes of these two wild morus species and utilized the data for marker development.


RESULTS
we generated  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb of transcriptome data from m. laevigata and m. serrata, respectively. the transcriptomes from m. laevigata and m. serrata, were assembled into  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts, respectively, and annotated. we identified around  <dig>  simple sequence repeats ,  <dig> , <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  and  <dig>  insertion-deletions . the variants having a higher impact were also identified and their effect was further investigated.


CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptome resource from the wildly growing mulberry species developed in this study can find wide applicability in gene identification and/or characterization. it can also contribute immensely in the existing mulberry improvement programs.
