BACKGROUND
hantavirus is a tripartite negative-sense rna virus. it can infect humans through contaminated rodent excreta and causes two types of fatal human diseases: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome  and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome . china exhibits the highest hfrs occurrence rate in the world, and the heilongjiang area is one of the most severely infected regions.


RESULTS
to obtain additional insights into the genetic characteristics of hantaviruses in the port cities of the heilongjiang area in china, a molecular epidemiological investigation of hantaviruses isolated from rodents was performed in  <dig>  a total of  <dig> rodents  were caught in  <dig> port cities in heilongjiang. among these rodents, the most common species was a. agrarius, and the second-most common was r. norvegicus. a viral gene pcr assay revealed the presence of two specific genotypes of hantavirus, referred to as hantaan virus  and seoul virus , and the positive seov infection rate was higher than that for htnv. a genetic analysis based on partial m segment sequences indicated that all of the isolates belonging to seov could be assigned to two genetic lineages, whereas the isolate belonging to htnv could be assigned to only one genetic lineage.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggested that htnv and seov are circulating in a. agrarius and r. norvegicus in the port cities in the area of heilongjiang, but seov may be the dominant common hantavirus.
