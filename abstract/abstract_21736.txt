BACKGROUND
at the end of the grazing season,  <dig> charolais × beef heifers  were abruptly weaned from their dams on day  <dig>  the animals were assigned by live weight to two treatments, transport    and control    on day  <dig>  the t animals were transported from ireland to france on a roll-on roll-off ferry at a stocking density of  <dig>  m2/animal and then by road for  <dig> h to a french lairage while c animals remained in ireland and were not transported. on arrival at the french lairage ,  <dig> t animals were unloaded  and rested for  <dig> h in the french lairage and  <dig> animals rested  on the transporter. all animals had access to hay and water. after the rest period, the ult animals were re-loaded. the subsequent journey by road from france to spain was  <dig> h travel,  <dig> h rest  and a further  <dig> h travel by road. all t animals were blood sampled prior to transport  0; baseline), on arrival in the french lairage , after  <dig> h rest in the french lairage , on arrival at the feedlot in spain  and on d  <dig>  d  <dig>  d  <dig> and d  <dig>  control animals were blood sampled at the same times as t animals.


RESULTS
ult and rt animals had lower  live weight than c animals on d  <dig>  wbc number was lower  in control animals on d  <dig> and greater on d  <dig> compared with baseline values. rt and ult animals had greater  wbc number than baseline on d  <dig>  to d  <dig>  neutrophil % was unchanged in rt, ult and control animals compared with baseline. control, rt and ult animals had lower haematocrit %  throughout the study compared with d  <dig>  there was no difference  in plasma protein concentration between rt and ult animals from day  <dig> to d  <dig>  plasma concentrations of urea were higher  in rt animals from d  <dig> to d  <dig> compared with c animals. rt and ult animals had lower  non-esterified fatty acid  and βeta-hydroxy-butyrate  concentrations on d  <dig> and d  <dig> compared with d  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
it is concluded that, within the conditions of the present study, the performance of the animals that remained on the transporter during the  <dig> h lairage period in france was not different post-transport from the transported animals that were unloaded and lairaged in france.
