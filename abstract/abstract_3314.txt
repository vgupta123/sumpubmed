BACKGROUND
protein degradation by the ubiquitin system plays a crucial role in numerous cellular signaling pathways. deubiquitination, a reversal of ubiquitination, has been recognized as an important regulatory step in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway.


RESULTS
while identifying putative ubiquitin specific protease  enzymes that contain a conserved asp  domain in humans,  <dig> usp <dig> subfamily members, highly homologous to dub- <dig>  have been found , from human chorionic villi. expression analysis showed that usp <dig> transcripts are highly expressed in the heart, liver, and pancreas and are expressed moderately in various human cancerous cell lines. amino acid sequence analysis revealed that they contain the highly conserved cys, his, and asp domains which are responsible for the deubiquitinating activity. biochemical enzyme assays indicated that they have deubiquitinating activity. interestingly, the sequence analysis showed that these proteins, with exception of usp17n, contain the putative hyaluronan/rna binding motifs, and cetylpyridinium chloride -precipitation analysis confirmed the association between these proteins and intracellular hyaluronan and rna.


CONCLUSIONS
here, we report that the overexpression of these proteins, with exception of usp17n, leads to apoptosis, suggesting that the hyaluronan and rna binding motifs in these enzymes play an important role in regulating signal transduction involved in cell death.
