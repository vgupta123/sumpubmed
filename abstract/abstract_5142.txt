BACKGROUND
a potential strategy for treatment of sickle cell disease  and β-thalassemia in adults is reactivation of the ε- and γ-globin genes in the adult. we aimed to identify trans-activators of ε- and γ-globin expression and provide new candidate targets for effective treatment of sickle cell disease  and β-thalassemia through activation of ε- and γ-globin genes in adults.


RESULTS
we identified a ctd small phosphatase like  <dig>  gene that had higher transcription levels in umbilical cord blood  than in adult bone marrow . also, transcription of the ctdspl <dig> gene increased significantly during erythroid differentiation. further, we found that overexpression of ctdspl <dig> could obviously improve the expression of ε- and γ-globin genes in k <dig> cells. meanwhile, the repression of ctdspl <dig> by rna interference decreased expression of ε- and γ-globin genes but did not inhibit the increase of globin gene expression during k <dig> erythroid differentiation. in addition, the enforced expression of ctdspl <dig> gene mediated by lentiviruses could also increase ε- and γ-globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation of cd34+ cells derived from ucb.


CONCLUSIONS
ctdspl <dig> gene can obviously improve the expression of ε- and γ-globin genes in k <dig> cells and cd34+ cells derived from ucb. our study provides a new candidate target for effective treatment of scd and β-thalassemia.
