BACKGROUND
stat <dig>  <cit>  has been shown to be dysregulated in nearly every major cancer, including osteosarcoma . constitutive activation of stat <dig>  via aberrant phosphorylation, leads to proliferation, cell survival and resistance to apoptosis. the present study sought to characterize the biologic activity of a novel allosteric stat <dig> inhibitor, lll <dig>  in canine os cell lines.


RESULTS
we evaluated the effects of lll <dig> treatment on  <dig> canine os cell lines and found that lll <dig> inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis, reduced stat <dig> phosphorylation, and decreased the expression of several transcriptional targets of stat <dig> in these cells. lastly, lll <dig> exhibited synergistic anti-proliferative activity with the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin in the os lines.


CONCLUSIONS
lll <dig> exhibits biologic activity against canine os cell lines through inhibition of stat <dig> related cellular functions supporting its potential use as a novel therapy for os.
