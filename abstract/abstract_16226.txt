BACKGROUND
arabidopsis thaliana  non-expressor of pr <dig>  is a transcription coactivator that plays a central role in regulating the transcriptional response to plant pathogens. developing flowers of homozygous npr <dig> mutants are dramatically more resistant to infection by the pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae, suggesting a role of npr <dig> as a repressor of npr1-mediated defense response with a novel role in flower development.


RESULTS
we report here the characterization of a putative npr <dig> gene from the tropical tree species theobroma cacao . like in arabidopsis, tcnpr <dig> was constitutively expressed across a wide range of tissue types and developmental stages but with some differences in relative levels compared to arabidopsis. to test the function of tcnpr <dig>  we performed transgenic complementation analysis by introducing a constitutively expressing putative tcnpr <dig> transgene into an arabidopsis npr <dig> mutant. tcnpr <dig> expressing arabidopsis plants were partially restored to the wt pathogen phenotype . to test tcnpr <dig> function directly in cacao tissues, a synthetic microrna targeting tcnpr <dig> mrna was transiently expressed in cacao leaves using an agrobacterium-infiltration method. tcnpr <dig> knock down leaf tissues were dramatically more resistance to infection with phytophthora capsici in a leaf bioassay, showing smaller lesion sizes and reduced pathogen replication.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that tcnpr <dig> functions similar to the arabidopsis npr <dig> gene in the regulation of the cacao defense response. since tcnpr <dig> did not show a perfect complementation of the arabidopsis npr <dig> mutation, the possibility remains that other functions of tcnpr <dig> remain to be found. this novel knowledge can contribute to the breeding of resistant cacao varieties against pathogens through molecular markers based approaches or biotechnological strategies.
