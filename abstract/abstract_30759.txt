BACKGROUND
a valuable tool for both research and industry, in vitro fertilization  has applications range from gamete selection and preservation of traits to cloning. although ivf has achieved worldwide use, with approximately  <dig>  bovine embryos transferred in  <dig> alone, there are still continuing difficulties with efficiency. it is rare to have more than 40% of fertilized in vitro cattle oocytes reach blastocyst stage by day  <dig> of culture, and pregnancy rates are reported as less than 45% for in vitro produced embryos. to investigate potential influences in-vitro fertilization  has on embryonic development, this study compares in vivo- and in vitro-derived bovine blastocysts at a similar stage and quality grade  to determine the degree of transcriptomic variation beyond morphology using rna-seq.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> fragments were sequenced for in vitro and in vivo embryo pools, respectively. we detected expression for a total of  <dig>  genes, with  <dig> genes showing differential expression between the two embryo populations with false discovery rate  <  <dig> . there were also  <dig> novel transcribed units found, of which  <dig> were differentially expressed . in addition,  <dig>  genes showed evidence of alternative splicing, with  <dig> genes displaying differential alternative splicing between the two pools . using go enrichment analysis, multiple biological pathways were found to be significantly enriched for differentially expressed genes , including cholesterol and sterol synthesis, system development, and cell differentiation.


CONCLUSIONS
thus, our results support that ivf may influence at the transcriptomic level and that morphology is limited in full characterization of bovine preimplantation embryos.
