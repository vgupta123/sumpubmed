BACKGROUND
calcineurin  is a ca2+- and calmodulin -dependent serine/threonine phosphatase. previous studies have found that can is involved in the regulation of the stress responses.


RESULTS
in this study, the growth of cryptococcus humicola was inhibited by the can inhibitor tacrolimus  under aluminum  stress. the expression of cna encoding a catalytic subunit a  and its interaction with cam were upregulated when the concentration of al was increased. a cam-binding domain and key amino acids responsible for interaction with cam were identified. ∆cnab with a deletion from s <dig> to a <dig> was detected to bind to cam, while ∆cnaa with a deletion from r <dig> to a <dig> showed no binding to cam. the binding affinities of cna <dig> and cna <dig>  in which i <dig> or i <dig> were replaced by ala, were decreased relative to wild-type cna. the phosphatase activities of ∆cnaa, cna <dig> and cna <dig> were lower than the wild-type protein. these results suggest that the region between r <dig> and s <dig> is essential for the interaction with cam and i <dig>  i <dig> are key amino acids in this region. the ability of the cna transgenic yeast to develop resistance to al was significantly higher than that of control yeast. residual al in the cna transgenic yeast culture media was significantly lower than the amount of al originally added to the media or the residual al remaining in the control yeast culture media. these findings suggest that cna confers al tolerance, and the mechanism of al tolerance may involve absorption of active al.


CONCLUSIONS
al stress up-regulated the expression of cna. cam-binding domain and key amino acids responsible for interaction with cam were identified and both are required for phosphatase activities. cna conferred yeast al resistance indicating that the gene has a potential to improve al-tolerance through gene engineering.
