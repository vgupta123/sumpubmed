BACKGROUND
the hawaiian red algal flora is diverse, isolated, and well studied from a morphological and anatomical perspective, making it an excellent candidate for assessment using a combination of traditional taxonomic and molecular approaches. acquiring and making these biodiversity data freely available in a timely manner ensures that other researchers can incorporate these baseline findings into phylogeographic studies of hawaiian red algae or red algae found in other locations.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  accessions are represented in the collections from  <dig> different geographical locations in the hawaiian archipelago. these accessions represent  <dig> orders,  <dig> families,  <dig> genera and  <dig> species/subspecific taxa of red algae. one order of red algae  was recognized in hawaii for the first time and  <dig> new island distributional records were determined from the survey collections. one family and four genera are reported for the first time from hawaii, and multiple species descriptions are in progress for newly discovered taxa. a total of  <dig>  sequences were generated for hawaiian red algae in the course of this study -  <dig> for the nuclear lsu marker,  <dig> for the plastidial upa marker, and  <dig> for the mitochondrial coi marker. these baseline molecular data are presented as neighbor-joining trees to illustrate degrees of divergence within and among taxa. the lsu marker was typically most conserved, followed by upa and coi. phylogenetic analysis of a set of concatenated lsu, upa and coi sequences recovered a tree that broadly resembled the current understanding of florideophyte red algal relationships, but bootstrap support was largely absent above the ordinal level. phylogeographic trends are reported here for some common taxa within the hawaiian islands and include examples of those with, as well as without, intraspecific variation.


CONCLUSIONS
the upa and coi markers were determined to be the most useful of the three and are recommended for inclusion in future algal biodiversity surveys. molecular data for the survey provide the most extensive assessment of hawaiian red algal diversity and, in combination with the morphological/anatomical and distributional data collected as part of the project, provide a solid baseline data set for future studies of the flora. the data are freely available via the hawaiian algal database , which was designed and constructed to accommodate the results of the project. we present the first dna sequence reference collection for a tropical pacific seaweed flora, whose value extends beyond hawaii since many hawaiian taxa are shared with other tropical areas.
