BACKGROUND
polycomb-group genes  encode proteins that maintain homeotic  gene repression throughout development. conversely, trithorax-group  genes encode positive factors required for maintenance of long term hox gene activation. both kinds of factors bind chromatin regions called maintenance elements . our previous work has shown that corto, which codes for a chromodomain protein, and dsp <dig>  which codes for an hmgb protein, belong to a class of genes called the enhancers of trithorax and polycomb  that interact with both pcg and trxg. moreover, dsp <dig> interacts with the hox gene scr, the dsp <dig> protein is present on a scr me in s <dig> cells but not in embryos. to understand better the role of etp, we addressed genetic and molecular interactions between corto and dsp <dig> 


RESULTS
we show that corto and dsp <dig> proteins co-localize at  <dig> sites on polytene chromosomes and co-immunoprecipitate in embryos. they interact directly through the dsp <dig> hmg-boxes and the amino-part of corto, which contains a chromodomain. in order to search for a common target, we performed a genetic interaction analysis. we observed that corto mutants suppressed dsp <dig> sex comb phenotypes and enhanced antpscx phenotypes, suggesting that corto and dsp <dig> are simultaneously involved in the regulation of scr. using chromatin immunoprecipitation of the scr me, we found that corto was present on this me both in drosophila s <dig> cells and in embryos, whereas dsp <dig> was present only in s <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our results reveal that the proteins corto and dsp <dig> are differently recruited to a scr me depending on whether the me is active, as seen in s <dig> cells, or inactive, as in most embryonic cells. the presence of a given combination of etps on an me would control the recruitment of either pcg or trxg complexes, propagating the silenced or active state.
