BACKGROUND
rag <dig>  mediates genomic rearrangement and is essential for adaptive immunity in vertebrates. this gene is also expressed in the olfactory epithelium, but its function there is unknown.


RESULTS
using a transgenic zebrafish line and immunofluorescence, we show that rag <dig> is expressed and translated in a subset of olfactory sensory neurons . neurons expressing gfp under the rag <dig> promoter project their axons to the lateral region of the olfactory bulb only, and axons with the highest levels of gfp terminate in a single glomerular structure. a subset of gfp-expressing neurons contain gαo, a marker for microvillous neurons. none of the gfp-positive neurons express gαolf, gαq or the olfactory marker protein omp. depletion of rag <dig>  by morpholino-mediated knockdown or mutation, did not affect axon targeting. calcium imaging indicates that amino acids evoke chemotopically organized glomerular activity patterns in a rag <dig> mutant.


CONCLUSIONS
rag <dig> expression is restricted to a subpopulation of zebrafish olfactory neurons projecting to the lateral olfactory bulb. rag <dig> catalytic activity is not essential for axon targeting, nor is it likely to be required for regulation of odorant receptor expression or the response of osns to amino acids.
