BACKGROUND
the genome of the melon  double-haploid line dhl <dig> was recently sequenced, with  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the scaffold assembly anchored and oriented to the  <dig> linkage groups, respectively. however, insufficient marker coverage and a lack of recombination left several large, gene rich scaffolds unanchored, and some anchored scaffolds unoriented. to improve the anchoring and orientation of the melon genome assembly, we used resequencing data between the parental lines of dhl <dig> to develop a new set of snp markers from unanchored scaffolds.


RESULTS
a high-resolution genetic map composed of  <dig> snps was used to anchor  <dig>  mb of sequence, contained in  <dig> scaffolds  and corresponding to  <dig> % of the scaffold assembly, to the  <dig> melon chromosomes. over  <dig>  mb  of the assembly was oriented. the genetic map revealed regions of segregation distortion favoring sc alleles as well as recombination suppression regions coinciding with putative centromere, 45s, and 5s rdna sites. new chromosome-scale pseudomolecules were created by incorporating to the previous v <dig>  version an additional  <dig>  mb of anchored sequence representing  <dig>  predicted genes contained in  <dig> scaffolds. using fluorescent in situ hybridization  with bacs that produced chromosome-specific signals, melon chromosomes that correspond to the twelve linkage groups were identified, and a standardized karyotype of melon inbred line t <dig> was developed.


CONCLUSIONS
by utilizing resequencing data and targeted snp selection combined with a large f <dig> mapping population, we significantly improved the quantity of anchored and oriented melon scaffold genome assembly. using genome information combined with fish mapping provided the first cytogenetic map of an inodorus melon type. with these results it was possible to make inferences on melon chromosome structure by relating zones of recombination suppression to centromeres and 45s and 5s heterochromatic regions. this study represents the first steps towards the integration of the high-resolution genetic and cytogenetic maps with the genomic sequence in melon that will provide more information on genome organization and allow for the improvement of the melon genome draft sequence.
