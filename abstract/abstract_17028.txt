BACKGROUND
plant hormones are well known regulators which balance plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. we investigated the role of abscisic acid  in resistance of barley  against the plant pathogenic fungus magnaporthe oryzae.


RESULTS
exogenous application of aba prior to inoculation with m. oryzae led to more disease symptoms on barley leaves. this result contrasted the finding that aba application enhances resistance of barley against the powdery mildew fungus. microscopic analysis identified diminished penetration resistance as cause for enhanced susceptibility. consistently, the barley mutant az <dig>  impaired in aba biosynthesis, was less susceptible to infection by m. oryzae and displayed elevated penetration resistance as compared to the isogenic wild type cultivar steptoe. chemical complementation of az <dig> mutant plants by exogenous application of aba re-established disease severity to the wild type level. the role of aba in susceptibility of barley against m. oryzae was corroborated by showing that aba application led to increased disease severity in all barley cultivars under investigation except for the most susceptible cultivar pallas. interestingly, endogenous aba concentrations did not significantly change after infection of barley with m. oryzae.


CONCLUSIONS
our results revealed that elevated aba levels led to a higher disease severity on barley leaves to m. oryzae. this supports earlier reports on the role of aba in enhancing susceptibility of rice to the same pathogen and thereby demonstrates a host plant-independent function of this phytohormone in pathogenicity of monocotyledonous plants against m. oryzae.
