BACKGROUND
cyanobacteria can form massive toxic blooms in fresh and brackish bodies of water and are frequently responsible for the poisoning of animals and pose a health risk for humans. anabaena is a genus of filamentous diazotrophic cyanobacteria commonly implicated as a toxin producer in blooms in aquatic ecosystems throughout the world. the biology of bloom-forming cyanobacteria is poorly understood at the genome level.


RESULTS
here, we report the complete sequence and comprehensive annotation of the bloom-forming anabaena sp. strain  <dig> genome. it comprises two circular chromosomes and three plasmids with a total size of  <dig>  mb, encoding a total of  <dig>  genes. the genome is replete with mobile genetic elements. detailed manual annotation demonstrated that almost 5% of the gene repertoire consists of pseudogenes. a further 5% of the genome is dedicated to the synthesis of small peptides that are the products of both ribosomal and nonribosomal biosynthetic pathways. inactivation of the hassallidin  biosynthetic gene cluster through a deletion event and a natural mutation of the buoyancy-permitting gvpg gas vesicle gene were documented. the genome contains a large number of genes encoding restriction-modification systems. two novel excision elements were found in the nifh gene that is required for nitrogen fixation.


CONCLUSIONS
genome analysis demonstrated that this strain invests heavily in the production of bioactive compounds and restriction-modification systems. this well-annotated genome provides a platform for future studies on the ecology and biology of these important bloom-forming cyanobacteria.
