BACKGROUND
shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig> is a facultative, gram-negative bacterium capable of coupling the oxidation of organic carbon to a wide range of electron acceptors such as oxygen, nitrate and metals, and has potential for bioremediation of heavy metal contaminated sites. the complete 5-mb genome of s. oneidensis mr- <dig> was sequenced and standard sequence-comparison methods revealed approximately 42% of the mr- <dig> genome encodes proteins of unknown function. defining the functions of hypothetical proteins is a great challenge and may need a systems approach. in this study, by using integrated approaches including whole genomic microarray and proteomics, we examined knockout effects of the gene encoding so <dig> , a member of the conserved, hypothetical, bacterial protein family cog <dig>  in bacterium shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig>  under various physiological conditions.


RESULTS
compared with the wild-type strain, growth assays showed that the deletion mutant had a decreased growth rate when cultured aerobically, but not affected under anaerobic conditions. whole-genome expression  profiles revealed numerous gene and protein expression changes relative to the wild-type control, including some involved in iron metabolism, oxidative damage protection and respiratory electron transfer, e. g. complex iv of the respiration chain. although total intracellular iron levels remained unchanged, whole-cell electron paramagnetic resonance  demonstrated that the level of free iron in mutant cells was  <dig> times less than that of the wild-type strain. siderophore excretion in the mutant also decreased in iron-depleted medium. the mutant was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and gave rise to  <dig> times more colonies resistant to gentamicin or kanamycin.


CONCLUSIONS
our results showed that the knock-out of so <dig> gene had pleiotropic effects and suggested that so <dig> may play a role in iron homeostasis and oxidative damage protection in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>
