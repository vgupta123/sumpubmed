BACKGROUND
the filamentous ascomycete hypocrea jecorina  is primarily known for its efficient enzymatic machinery that it utilizes to decompose cellulosic substrates. nevertheless, the nature and transmission of the signals initiating and modulating this machinery are largely unknown. heterotrimeric g-protein signaling represents one of the best studied signal transduction pathways in fungi.


RESULTS
analysis of the regulatory targets of the g-protein α subunit gna <dig> in h. jecorina revealed a carbon source and light-dependent role in signal transduction. deletion of gna <dig> led to significantly decreased biomass formation in darkness in submersed culture but had only minor effects on morphology and hyphal apical extension rates on solid medium. cellulase gene transcription was abolished in Δgna <dig> on cellulose in light and enhanced in darkness. however, analysis of strains expressing a constitutively activated gna <dig> revealed that gna <dig> does not transmit the essential inducing signal. instead, it relates a modulating signal with light-dependent significance, since induction still required the presence of an inducer. we show that regulation of transcription and activity of gna <dig> involves a carbon source-dependent feedback cycle. additionally we found a function of gna <dig> in hydrophobin regulation as well as effects on conidiation and tolerance of osmotic and oxidative stress.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that gna <dig> transmits a signal the physiological relevance of which is dependent on both the carbon source as well as the light status. the widespread consequences of mutations in gna <dig> indicate a broad function of this gα subunit in appropriation of intracellular resources to environmental  conditions.
