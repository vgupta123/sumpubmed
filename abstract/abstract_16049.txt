BACKGROUND
rna-mediated interference -based functional genomics is a systems-level approach to identify novel genes that control biological phenotypes. existing computational approaches can identify individual genes from rnai datasets that regulate a given biological process. however, currently available methods cannot identify which rnai screen "hits" are novel components of well-characterized biological pathways known to regulate the interrogated phenotype. in this study, we describe a method to identify genes from rnai datasets that are novel components of known biological pathways. we experimentally validate our approach in the context of a recently completed rnai screen to identify novel regulators of melanogenesis.


RESULTS
in this study, we utilize a ppi network topology-based approach to identify targets within our rnai dataset that may be components of known melanogenesis regulatory pathways. our computational approach identifies a set of screen targets that cluster topologically in a human ppi network with the known pigment regulator endothelin receptor type b . validation studies reveal that these genes impact pigment production and ednrb signaling in pigmented melanoma cells  and normal melanocytes.


CONCLUSIONS
we present an approach that identifies novel components of well-characterized biological pathways from functional genomics datasets that could not have been identified by existing statistical and computational approaches.
