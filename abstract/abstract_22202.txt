BACKGROUND
alpha-fetoprotein  is a tumor-associated glycoprotein that functions in regulation of both ontogenic and oncogenic growth. recent study showed that afp can induce apoptosis or impair monocyte-derived dendritic cell  function. however, it is still unclear which afp domain  plays major role in this function.


RESULTS
as expected monocytes cultured in the presence of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor  and interleukin- <dig>  developed into mddc. up-regulation of hla-dr and cd11c as well as loss of cd <dig> molecules could be observed. full length afp , domain  <dig> afp  and d3-afp, but not d1-afp, significantly inhibited the expression of hla-drhigh/cd11chigh and cd80+/cd86high molecules. in contrast, cd <dig> expression was substantially down-regulated in all samples. expression of cd <dig> was significantly suppressed by fl-afp but not by any d-afps. finally, both fl-afp and d-afp impaired the mddc ability to secrete il- <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
d2- and d3- but not d1-afp extensively suppresses the mddc function. all the recombinant afp proteins impaired the ability of mddc to secrete il- <dig>
