BACKGROUND
flubendazole  is a poor water solubility broad-spectrum bzd methylcarbamate anthelmintic compound. cyclodextrins  are usually used to increase aqueous solubility of poor hydrosoluble compounds. the comparative in vitro aqueous solubility of flbz and other bzd anthelmintics in the presence of hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin  was evaluated in the current work. additionally, the comparative pharmacokinetic behaviour of flbz  administered by the intraruminal  or intraabomasal  routes to sheep as either an aqueous cds-based solution or a conventional carboximethylcellulose  suspension was assessed. drug solubility studies involving albendazole, mebendazole, oxfendazole and flbz were performed in an aqueous solution  with or without hpβcd . the pharmacokinetic study involved two experiments. experiment 1: in a crossover study, sheep received either a flbz-cds solution  or a flbz-cmc suspension  by the i.r. route . the treatment groups were reversed after a 21-days washout period. experiment 2: sheep  were treated by the i.a. route with the flbz-cds solution . plasma and abomasal fluid samples were collected between  <dig> and 72 h post-treatment. samples were analysed by hplc.


RESULTS
improvement of flbz aqueous solubility due to cds resulted markedly higher than that observed for mebendazole and albendazole. however, oppositely to what was expected, the absorption-related pharmacokinetic parameters did not show any marked formulation-dependant effect. after the i.a. administration of flbz, the auc and the tmax of the parent compound were significantly  reduced, which is consistent with ruminal bypass.


CONCLUSIONS
the administration of flbz as a cds-based solution, does not seem to achieve great practical relevance for parasite control in sheep.
