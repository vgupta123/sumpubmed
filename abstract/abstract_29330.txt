BACKGROUND
although ion fluxes are considered to be an integral part of signal transduction during responses to pathogens, only a few ion channels are known to participate in the plant response to infection. cngc <dig> is a disease resistance-related cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel. arabidopsis thaliana cngc <dig> mutants hlm <dig> and dnd <dig> display an impaired hypersensitive response , retarded growth, a constitutively active salicylic acid -mediated pathogenesis-related response and elevated resistance against bacterial pathogens. barley cngc <dig> shares 67% aa identity with atcngc <dig>  the barley mutant nec <dig> comprising of a frame-shift mutation of cngc <dig> displays a necrotic phenotype and constitutively over-expresses pr- <dig>  yet it is not known what effect the nec <dig> mutation has on barley resistance against different types of pathogens.


RESULTS
nec <dig> mutant accumulated high amount of sa and hydrogen peroxide compared to parental cv. parkland. experiments investigating nec <dig> disease resistance demonstrated positive effect of nec <dig> mutation on non-host resistance against pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato  at high inoculum density, whereas at normal pst inoculum concentration nec <dig> resistance did not differ from wt. in contrast to augmented p. syringae resistance, penetration resistance against biotrophic fungus blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei , the causal agent of powdery mildew, was not altered in nec <dig>  the nec <dig> mutant significantly over-expressed race non-specific bgh resistance-related genes bi- <dig> and mlo. induction of bi- <dig> and mlo suggested putative involvement of nec <dig> in race non-specific bgh resistance, therefore the effect of nec1on mlo-5-mediated bgh resistance was assessed. the nec1/mlo- <dig> double mutant was as resistant to bgh as nec1/mlo- <dig> plants, suggesting that nec <dig> did not impair mlo- <dig> race non-specific bgh resistance.


CONCLUSIONS
together, the results suggest that nec <dig> mutation alters activation of systemic acquired resistance-related physiological markers and non-host resistance in barley, while not changing rapid localized response during compatible interaction with host pathogen. increased resistance of nec <dig> against non-host pathogen pst suggests that nec <dig> mutation may affect certain aspects of barley disease resistance, while it remains to be determined, if the effect on disease resistance is a direct response to changes in sa signaling.
