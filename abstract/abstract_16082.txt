BACKGROUND
ok- <dig>  penicillin-killed streptococcus pyogenes, is used in treating lymphangiomas and carcinomas. we have studied in vitro the role of mononuclear phagocytes , including purified monocytes , in the immune response to ok- <dig>  mip-1α/β and mcp- <dig> secretions were assessed in whole blood , peripheral blood mononuclear cells  and purified mos, after in vitro stimulation with ok- <dig> with or without adherence for  <dig> hours.


RESULTS
ok- <dig> stimulated mnps to secrete mcp- <dig> and mip-1α/β in healthy individuals and in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  patients, except for ok- <dig> stimulation of wb giving a minimal mip-1α/β response. upon culture on low-attachment wells, a spontaneous chemokine secretion was observed, with an unchanged secretion following ok- <dig> stimulation. inhibition of syk kinase and/or pi- <dig> kinase did not significantly change the chemokine response to ok- <dig>  except for mip-1α production being increased upon syk inhibitor addition and an increased mcp- <dig> response upon addition of both inhibitors. adhesion may possibly involve β <dig> and/or β <dig> integrins, not β <dig>  whereas β1– <dig> integrins may act as co-stimulatory receptors for ok- <dig>  based on direct blockage of cd <dig> or cd <dig> by antibodies, mcp- <dig> production may be mediated by cd <dig> while mip-1β and mcp- <dig> production may occur upon binding to cd <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
adherent human mos produce mcp- <dig> and mip-1α/β upon stimulation with ok- <dig>  cd <dig> modulates mip-1β and mcp- <dig> response. thus, to some extent ok- <dig> acts as a substance whereby only mos adhered to surfaces secrete mcp- <dig> and mip-1α/β, in part explaining why ok- <dig> is suited as a biological response modifying drug.
