BACKGROUND
genetic markers and linkage mapping are basic prerequisites for comparative genetic analyses, qtl detection and map-based cloning. a large number of mapping populations have been developed for oak, but few gene-based markers are available for constructing integrated genetic linkage maps and comparing gene order and qtl location across related species.


RESULTS
we developed a set of  <dig> expressed sequence tag-derived simple sequence repeats  and located  <dig> markers  on the  <dig> oak chromosomes  on the basis of mendelian segregation patterns in  <dig> full-sib mapping pedigrees of two species: quercus robur  and quercus petraea . consensus maps for the two species were constructed and aligned. they showed a high degree of macrosynteny between these two sympatric european oaks. we assessed the transferability of est-ssrs to other fagaceae genera and a subset of these markers was mapped in castanea sativa, the european chestnut. reasonably high levels of macrosynteny were observed between oak and chestnut. we also obtained diversity statistics for a subset of est-ssrs, to support further population genetic analyses with gene-based markers. finally, based on the orthologous relationships between the oak, arabidopsis, grape, poplar, medicago, and soybean genomes and the paralogous relationships between the  <dig> oak chromosomes, we propose an evolutionary scenario of the  <dig> oak chromosomes from the eudicot ancestral karyotype.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides map locations for a large set of est-ssrs in two oak species of recognized biological importance in natural ecosystems. this first step toward the construction of a gene-based linkage map will facilitate the assignment of future genome scaffolds to pseudo-chromosomes. this study also provides an indication of the potential utility of new gene-based markers for population genetics and comparative mapping within and beyond the fagaceae.
