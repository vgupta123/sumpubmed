BACKGROUND
the draft genome of the domestic pig  has recently been published permitting refined analysis of the transcriptome. pig breeds have been reported to differ in their resistance to infectious disease. in this study we examine whether there are corresponding differences in gene expression in innate immune cells


RESULTS
we demonstrate that macrophages can be harvested from three different compartments of the pig , cryopreserved and subsequently recovered and differentiated in csf- <dig>  we have performed surface marker analysis and gene expression profiling on macrophages from these compartments, comparing twenty-five animals from five different breeds and their response to lipopolysaccharide. the results provide a clear distinction between alveolar macrophages  and monocyte-derived  and bone-marrow-derived macrophages . in particular, the lung macrophages express the growth factor, flt <dig> and its ligand, vegfa at high levels, suggesting a distinct pathway of growth regulation. relatively few genes showed breed-specific differential expression, notably cxcr <dig> and cd <dig> in alveolar macrophages. in contrast, there was substantial inter-individual variation between pigs within breeds, mostly affecting genes annotated as being involved in immune responses.


CONCLUSIONS
pig macrophages more closely resemble human, than mouse, in their set of macrophage-expressed and lps-inducible genes. future research will address whether inter-individual variation in macrophage gene expression is heritable, and might form the basis for selective breeding for disease resistance.
