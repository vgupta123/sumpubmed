BACKGROUND
the genetic mechanisms underlying hemangioblastoma development are still largely unknown. we used high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays and droplet digital pcr analysis to detect copy number variations  in total of  <dig> hemangioblastoma tumors.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> cnvs with a median of  <dig> cnvs per sample. the most frequently gained regions were on chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> . these regions contain the egfr and prdm <dig> genes. recurrent losses were located at chromosome  <dig> , which includes the gene ptpn <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our findings provide the first high-resolution genome-wide view of chromosomal changes in hemangioblastoma and identify  <dig> candidate genes: egfr, prdm <dig>  ptpn <dig>  hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig>  flt <dig>  ptch, fgfr <dig>  foxp <dig>  gpc <dig>  hoxc <dig>  hoxc <dig>  mkl <dig>  chek <dig>  irf <dig>  gphn, ikzf <dig>  rb <dig>  hoxa <dig>  and micro rna, such as hsa-mir-196a- <dig> for hemangioblastoma pathogenesis. furthermore, our data implicate that cell proliferation and angiogenesis promoting pathways may be involved in the molecular pathogenesis of hemangioblastoma.
