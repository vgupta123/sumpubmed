BACKGROUND
micrornas are small non-coding rna transcripts that regulate post-transcriptional gene expression. the millions of short sequence reads generated by next generation sequencing technologies make this technique explicitly suitable for profiling of known and novel micrornas. a modification to the small-rna expression kit  library preparation method for the solid sequencing platform is described to generate microrna sequencing libraries that are compatible with the illumina genome analyzer.


RESULTS
high quality sequencing libraries can successfully be prepared from as little as  <dig> ng small rna enriched rna. an easy to use perl-based analysis pipeline called e-mir was developed to handle the sequencing data in several automated steps including data format conversion, 3' adapter removal, genome alignment and annotation to non-coding rna transcripts. the sample preparation and e-mir pipeline were used to identify  <dig> cardiac enriched micrornas in stage  <dig> chicken embryos. isomir expression profiles between the heart and embryo were highly correlated for all mirnas suggesting that tissue or cell specific mirna modifications do not occur.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our alternative sample preparation method can successfully be applied to generate high quality mirna sequencing libraries for the illumina genome analyzer.
