BACKGROUND
blood–brain barrier  disruption is an integral feature of numerous neurological disorders. however, there is a relative lack of knowledge regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms of immune-mediated bbb disruption. we have previously shown that cd <dig> t cells and perforin play critical roles in initiating altered permeability of the bbb in the peptide-induced fatal syndrome  model developed by our laboratory. additionally, despite having indistinguishable cd <dig> t cell responses, c57bl/6j  mice are highly susceptible to pifs, exhibiting functional motor deficits, increased astrocyte activation, and severe cns vascular permeability, while 129s1/svimj  mice remain resistant. therefore, to investigate the potential role of genetic factors, we performed a comprehensive genetic analysis of  f <dig> progeny to define quantitative trait loci  linked to the phenotypic characteristics stated above that mediate cd <dig> t cell-initiated bbb disruption.


RESULTS
using single nucleotide polymorphism  markers and a 95% confidence interval, we identified one qtl  on chromosome  <dig> linked to deficits in motor function . in addition we identified a second qtl  on chromosome  <dig> linked to changes in cns vascular permeability .


CONCLUSIONS
the qtl critical intervals discovered have allowed for compilation of a list of candidate genes implicated in regulating functional deficit and cns vascular permeability. these genes encode for factors that may be potential targets for therapeutic approaches to treat disorders characterized by cd <dig> t cell-mediated bbb disruption.
