BACKGROUND
fruits from several species of the rosaceae family are reported to cause allergic reactions in certain populations. the allergens identified belong to mainly four protein families: pathogenesis related  <dig> proteins, thaumatin-like proteins, lipid transfer proteins and profilins. these families of putative allergen genes in apple  have been mapped on linkage maps and subsequent genetic study on allelic diversity and hypoallergenic traits has been carried out recently. in peach , these allergen gene families are denoted as pru p  <dig> to  <dig> and for almond pru du  <dig> to  <dig>  genetic analysis using current molecular tools may be helpful to establish the cause of allergenicity differences observed among different peach cultivars. this study was to characterize putative peach allergen genes for their genomic sequences and linkage map positions, and to compare them with previously characterized homologous genes in apple .


RESULTS
eight pru p/du  <dig> genes were identified, four of which were new. all the pru p/du  <dig> genes were mapped in a single bin on the top of linkage group  <dig> . five pru p/du  <dig> genes were mapped on four different linkage groups, two very similar pru p/du  <dig>  genes  were on g <dig>  pru p/du  <dig>  on g <dig> pru p/du  <dig>  on g <dig> and pru p/du  <dig>  on g <dig>  there were differences in the intron and exon structure in these pru p/du  <dig> genes and in their amino acid composition. three pru p/du  <dig> genes  containing an intron and a mini exon of  <dig> nt were mapped in a cluster on g <dig>  two pru p/du  <dig> genes  were located on g <dig> and g <dig>  respectively. the pru p/du  <dig> cluster on g <dig> aligned to the mal d  <dig> clusters on lg16; pru p/du  <dig> a and b on g <dig> to mal d  <dig> a and b on lg9; the pru p/du  <dig> cluster on g <dig> to mal d  <dig>  on lg12; pru p/du  <dig>  on g <dig> to mal d  <dig>  on lg2; and pru p/du  <dig>  on g <dig> to mal d  <dig>  on lg <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
a total of  <dig> putative peach/almond allergen genes have been mapped on five linkage groups. their positions confirm the high macro-synteny between peach/almond and apple. the insight gained will help to identify key genes causing differences in allergenicity among different cultivars of peach and other prunus species.
