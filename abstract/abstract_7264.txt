BACKGROUND
homologous recombination is the key process that generates genetic diversity and drives evolution. spo <dig> protein triggers recombination by introducing dna double stranded breaks at discreet areas of the genome called recombination hotspots. the hotspot locations are largely determined by the dna binding specificity of the prdm <dig> protein in human, mice and most other mammals. in budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisae, which lacks a prdm <dig> gene, meiotic breaks are formed opportunistically in the regions of accessible chromatin, primarily at gene promoters. the genome-wide distribution of hotspots in this organism can be altered by tethering spo <dig> protein to gal <dig> recognition sequences in the strain expressing spo <dig> attached to the dna binding domain of the gal <dig> transcription factor. to establish whether similar re-targeting of meiotic breaks can be achieved in prdm9-containing organisms we have generated a gal4bd-spo <dig> mouse that expresses spo <dig> protein joined to the dna binding domain of yeast gal <dig> 


RESULTS
we have mapped the genome-wide distribution of the recombination initiation sites in the gal4bd-spo <dig> mice. more than two hundred of the hotspots in these mice were novel and were likely defined by gal4bd, as the gal <dig> consensus motif was clustered around the centers in these hotspots. surprisingly, meiotic dna breaks in the gal4bd-spo <dig> mice were significantly depleted near the ends of chromosomes. the effect is particularly striking at the pseudoautosomal region of the x and y chromosomes â€“ normally the hottest region in the genome.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that specific, yet-unidentified factors influence the initiation of meiotic recombination at subtelomeric chromosomal regions.
