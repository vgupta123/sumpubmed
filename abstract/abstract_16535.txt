BACKGROUND
the maturation of hydrogenases into active enzymes is a complex process and e.g. a correctly assembled active site requires the involvement of at least seven proteins, encoded by hypabcdef and a hydrogenase specific protease, encoded either by hupw or hoxw. the n2-fixing cyanobacterium nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig> may contain both an uptake and a bidirectional hydrogenase. the present study addresses the presence and expression of hyp-genes in nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig> 


RESULTS
rt-pcrs demonstrated that the six hyp-genes together with one orf may be transcribed as a single operon. transcriptional start points  were identified  <dig> bp upstream from hypf and  <dig> bp upstream of hypc, respectively, demonstrating the existence of several transcripts. in addition, five upstream orfs located in between hupsl, encoding the small and large subunits of the uptake hydrogenase, and the hyp-operon, and two downstream orfs from the hyp-genes were shown to be part of the same transcript unit. a third tsp was identified  <dig> bp upstream of asr <dig>  the first of five orfs in this operon. the orfs are annotated as encoding unknown proteins, with the exception of alr <dig> which is identified as a nifu-like protein. orthologues of the four orfs asr0689-alr <dig>  with a highly conserved genomic arrangement positioned between hupsl, and the hyp genes are found in several other n2-fixing cyanobacteria, but are absent in non n2-fixing cyanobacteria with only the bidirectional hydrogenase. short conserved sequences were found in six intergenic regions of the extended hyp-operon, appearing between  <dig> and  <dig> times in the genome.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that five orfs upstream of the hyp-gene cluster are co-transcribed with the hyp-genes, and identified three tsps in the extended hyp-gene cluster in nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig>  this may indicate a function related to the assembly of a functional uptake hydrogenase, hypothetically in the assembly of the small subunit of the enzyme.
