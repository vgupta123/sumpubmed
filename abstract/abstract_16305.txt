BACKGROUND
community acquired  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  increasingly causes disease worldwide. usa <dig> has emerged as the predominant clone causing superficial and invasive infections in children and adults in the usa. epidemiological studies suggest that usa <dig> is more virulent than other ca-mrsa. the genetic determinants that render virulence and dominance to usa <dig> remain unclear.


RESULTS
we sequenced the genomes of two pediatric usa <dig> isolates: one ca-mrsa and one ca-methicillin susceptible , isolated at texas children's hospital in houston. dna sequencing was performed by sanger dideoxy whole genome shotgun  and  <dig> life sciences pyrosequencing strategies. the sequence of the usa <dig> mrsa strain was rigorously annotated. in usa300-mrsa  <dig> chromosomal open reading frames were predicted and  <dig>  and  <dig> kilobase  plasmids were identified. usa300-mssa contained a  <dig> kb plasmid with some homology to the  <dig> kb plasmid found in usa300-mrsa. two regions found in us300-mrsa were absent in usa300-mssa. one of these carried the arginine deiminase operon that appears to have been acquired from s. epidermidis. the usa <dig> sequence was aligned with other sequenced s. aureus genomes and regions unique to usa <dig> mrsa were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
usa300-mrsa is highly similar to other mrsa strains based on whole genome alignments and gene content, indicating that the differences in pathogenesis are due to subtle changes rather than to large-scale acquisition of virulence factor genes. the usa <dig> houston isolate differs from another sequenced usa <dig> strain isolate, derived from a patient in san francisco, in plasmid content and a number of sequence polymorphisms. such differences will provide new insights into the evolution of pathogens.
