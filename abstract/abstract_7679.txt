BACKGROUND
cycas simplicipinna  k. hill.  is an endangered species in china. there were seven populations and  <dig> individuals that we could collect were genotyped in this study. here, we assessed the genetic diversity, genetic structure and demographic history of this species.


RESULTS
analyses of data of dna sequences  and sixteen microsatellite loci  were conducted in the species. of the  <dig> samples,  <dig> individuals from the seven populations were used for dna sequencing and  <dig> individuals from six populations were used for the microsatellite study. we found high genetic diversity at the species level, low genetic diversity within each of the seven populations and high genetic differentiation among the populations. there was a clear genetic structure within populations of c. simplicipinna. a demographic history inferred from dna sequencing data indicates that c. simplicipinna experienced a recent population contraction without retreating to a common refugium during the last glacial period. the results derived from ssr data also showed that c. simplicipinna underwent past effective population contraction, likely during the pleistocene.


CONCLUSIONS
some genetic features of c. simplicipinna such as having high genetic differentiation among the populations, a clear genetic structure and a recent population contraction could provide guidelines for protecting this endangered species from extinction. furthermore, the genetic features with population dynamics of the species in our study would help provide insights and guidelines for protecting other endangered species effectively.
