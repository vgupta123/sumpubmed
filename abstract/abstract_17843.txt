BACKGROUND
the snake venom group iia secreted phospholipases a <dig> , present in the viperidae snake family exhibit a wide range of toxic and pharmacological effects. they exert their different functions by catalyzing the hydrolysis of phospholipids  at the membrane/water interface and by highly specific direct binding to:  presynaptic membrane-bound or intracellular receptors;  natural pla2-inhibitors from snake serum; and  coagulation factors present in human blood.


RESULTS
using surface plasmon resonance  protein-protein interaction measurements and an in vitro biological test of inhibition of prothrombinase activity, we identify a number of viperidae venom svpla2s that inhibit blood coagulation through direct binding to human blood coagulation factor xa  via a non-catalytic, pl-independent mechanism. we classify the svpla2s in four groups, depending on the strength of their binding.

molecular electrostatic potentials calculated at the surface of 3d homology-modeling models show a correlation with inhibition of prothrombinase activity. in addition, molecular docking simulations between svpla <dig> and fxa guided by the experimental data identify the potential fxa binding site on the svpla2s. this site is composed of the following regions: helices a and b, the ca2+ loop, the helix c-Î²-wing loop, and the c-terminal fragment. some of the svpla <dig> binding site residues belong also to the interfacial binding site . the interface in fxa involves both, the light and heavy chains.


CONCLUSIONS
we have experimentally identified several strong fxa-binding svpla2s that disrupt the function of the coagulation cascade by interacting with fxa by the non-catalytic pl-independent mechanism. by theoretical methods we mapped the interaction sites on both, the svpla2s and fxa. our findings may lead to the design of novel, non-competitive fxa inhibitors.
