BACKGROUND
interleukin- <dig> homologues encoded by herpes viruses such as epstein-barr virus  and human cytomegalovirus  hold interesting structural and biological characteristics compared to human interleukin- <dig>  that render these proteins promising candidates for therapeutic application in inflammatory bowel disease . intestinal delivery of cytokines using bacterial carriers as chassis represents a novel approach for treatment of ibd patients. for proof of concept, a sec-dependent transporter construct was designed for secretory expression of recombinant viral il- <dig> proteins in the periplasm of escherichia coli laboratory strain bl <dig> , which might serve as part of a prospective lysis based delivery and containment system.


RESULTS
the signal peptide of e. coli outer membrane protein f fused to the mature form of the viral il- <dig> proteins enabled successful transport into the periplasm, a compartment which seems crucial for proper assembly of the dimeric configuration of the cytokines. cytokine concentrations in different bacterial compartments were determined by elisa and achieved yields of  <dig>  ng/ml ±  <dig>  ng/ml for hcmv il- <dig> and  <dig>  μg/ml ±  <dig>  ng/ml for ebv il- <dig> in the periplasm. immunoblot analysis was used to confirm the correct size of the e. coli-derived recombinant cytokines. phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  as part of the signal transduction cascade after il- <dig> receptor interaction, as well as suppression of tumor necrosis factor α  release of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse macrophages were used as read-out assays for proving in vitro biological activity of the e. coli derived, recombinant viral il- <dig> counterparts.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, proof of principle is provided that e. coli cells are a suitable chassis for secretory expression of viral il- <dig> cytokines encoded by codon-optimized synthetic genes fused to the e. coli ompf signal sequence. in vitro biological activity evidenced by activation of transcription factor stat <dig> and suppression of tnf-α in mammalian cell lines was shown to be strictly dependent on export of viral il- <dig> proteins into the periplasmic compartment. e. coli might serve as carrier system for in situ delivery of therapeutic molecules in the gut, thus representing a further step in the development of novel approaches for treatment of ibd.
