BACKGROUND
leishmania and other members of the trypanosomatidae family diverged early on in eukaryotic evolution and consequently display unique cellular properties. their apparent lack of transcriptional regulation is compensated by complex post-transcriptional control mechanisms, including the processing of polycistronic transcripts by means of coupled trans-splicing and polyadenylation. trans-splicing signals are often u-rich polypyrimidine ) tracts, which precede ag splice acceptor sites. however, as opposed to higher eukaryotes there is no consensus polyadenylation signal in trypanosomatid mrnas.


RESULTS
we refined a previously reported method to target 5' splice junctions by incorporating the pyrimidine content of query sequences into a scoring function. we also investigated a novel approach for predicting polyadenylation ) sites in-silico, by comparing query sequences to polyadenylated expressed sequence tags  using position-specific scanning matrices . an additional analysis of the distribution of putative splice junction to poly distances helped to increase prediction rates by limiting the scanning range. these methods were able to simplify splice junction prediction without loss of precision and to increase polyadenylation site prediction from 22% to 47% within  <dig> nucleotides.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose a simplified trans-splicing prediction tool and a novel poly prediction tool based on comparative sequence analysis. we discuss the impact of certain regions surrounding the poly sites on prediction rates and contemplate correlating biological mechanisms. this work aims to sharpen the identification of potentially functional untranslated regions  in a large-scale, comparative genomics framework.
