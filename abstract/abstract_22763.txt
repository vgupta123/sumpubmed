BACKGROUND
mutations in apc, a negative regulator of the wnt/ß-catenin pathway, can cause cancer as well as profound developmental defects. in both cases, affected cells adopt a proliferative progenitor state and fail to differentiate. while the upregulation of some target genes of wnt/ß-catenin signaling has been shown to mediate these phenotypes in individual tissues, it is unclear whether a common mechanism underlies the defects in apc mutants.


RESULTS
here we show that stat <dig>  a known oncogene and a target of ß-catenin in multiple tissues, is upregulated in apc mutant zebrafish embryos. we further demonstrate that jak/stat signaling is necessary for the increased level of proliferation and neural progenitor gene expression observed in apc mutants.


CONCLUSIONS
together, our data suggest that the regulation of jak/stat signaling may represent a conserved mechanism explaining the expansion of undifferentiated cells downstream of apc mutations.
