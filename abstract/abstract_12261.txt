BACKGROUND
metoclopramide is a dopamine d2-receptor antagonist used as an antiemetic and gastroprokinetic agent in man and animals. the drug causes sedation as a side effect in man. such a sedative action of metoclopramide has not been documented in the chicken as the drug is not used clinically in this species. the present study examines the central nervous system depressant effects of metoclopramide in 7– <dig> days old broiler chicks.


RESULTS
injection of metoclopramide at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg, subcutaneously  induced sedation in the chicks in a dose dependent manner. the chicks manifested, within  <dig> – <dig> minutes of metoclopramide injection, signs of sedation characterized by drooping of the head and wings, closed eyelids, reduced motility and decreased distress calls. the duration of sedation ranged between  <dig>  to  <dig>  minutes. metoclopramide at  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg induced, within  <dig>  and  <dig>  minutes, sleep  for  <dig>  and  <dig>  minutes, respectively. the median effective doses of metoclopramide for induction of sedation and sleep in the chicks were  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg, s.c., respectively. lower doses of metoclopramide  significantly decreased the open-field activity of the chicks and increased the durations of their tonic immobility. all treated-chicks recovered from the central nervous system depressant effect of metoclopramide without any observable adverse effects.


CONCLUSIONS
the data suggest that metoclopramide induces central nervous system depression in chicks, and the drug could have potential clinical applications as a sedative-hypnotic agent in avian species not intended for human consumptions.
