BACKGROUND
the absorptive and goblet cells are the main cellular types encountered in the intestine epithelium. the cell lineage caco- <dig> is a model commonly used to reproduce the features of the bowel epithelium. however, there is a strong debate regarding the value of caco- <dig> cell culture to mimick in vivo situation. indeed, some authors report in caco- <dig> a low paracellular permeability and an ease of access of highly diffusible small molecules to the microvilli, due to an almost complete lack of mucus. the ht29-5m <dig> intestinal cell lineage is a mucin-secreting cellular population. a co-culture system carried out in a serum-free medium and comprising both caco- <dig> and ht29-5m <dig> cells was developed. the systematic use of a co-culture system requires the characterization of the monolayer under a given experimental procedure.


RESULTS
in this study, we investigated the activity and localization of the alkaline phosphatase and the expression of iap and muc5ac genes to determine a correlation between these markers and the cellular composition of a differentiated monolayer obtained from a mixture of caco- <dig> and ht29-5m <dig> cells. we observed that the culture conditions used  did not change the phenotype of each cell type, and produced a reproducible model. the alkaline phosphatase expression characterizing caco- <dig> cells was influenced by the presence of ht29-5m <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the culture formed by 75% caco- <dig> and 25% ht29-5m <dig> produce a monolayer containing the two main cell types of human intestinal epithelium and characterized by a reduced permeability to macromolecules.
