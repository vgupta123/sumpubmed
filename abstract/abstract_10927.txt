BACKGROUND
xylitol has antiadhesive effects on streptococcus pneumoniae and inhibits its growth, and has also been found to be effective in preventing acute otitis media and has been used in intensive care as a valuable source of energy.


RESULTS
we evaluated the oxidative burst of neutrophils in rats fed with and without xylitol. the mean increase in the percentage of activated neutrophils from the baseline was higher in the xylitol-exposed group than in the control group  and the mean induced increase in the median strength of the burst per neutrophil was similarly higher in the xylitol group . in two pneumococcal sepsis experiments rats were fed either a basal powder diet  or the same diet supplemented with 10% or 20% xylitol and infected with an intraperitoneal inoculation of s. pneumoniae after two weeks. the mean survival time was  <dig> hours in the xylitol groups and  <dig> hours in the control groups .


CONCLUSIONS
xylitol has beneficial effects on both the oxidative killing of bacteria in neutrophilic leucocytes and on the survival of rats with experimental pneumococcal sepsis.
