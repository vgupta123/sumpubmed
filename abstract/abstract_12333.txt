BACKGROUND
effective bioinformatics solutions are needed to tackle challenges posed by industrial-scale genome annotation. we present bcheck, a wrapper tool which predicts rnase p rna genes by combining the speed of pattern matching and sensitivity of covariance models. the core of bcheck is a library of subfamily specific descriptor models and covariance models.


RESULTS
scanning all microbial genomes in genbank identifies rnase p rna genes in 98% of  <dig> microbial chromosomal sequences within just  <dig> hours on single cpu. comparing to existing annotations found in  <dig> of the genbank files, bcheck predictions have more intact structure and are automatically classified by subfamily membership. for eukaryotic chromosomes bcheck could identify the known rnase p rna genes in  <dig> out of  <dig> metazoan genomes and  <dig> out of  <dig> fungi genomes. bcheck predicted  <dig> novel eukaryotic rnase p rna genes,  <dig> of which are from fungi. gene duplication events are observed in at least  <dig> metazoan organisms. scanning of meta-genomic data from the global ocean sampling expedition, comprising over  <dig> million sample sequences , predicted  <dig> unique genes, 98% of which fall into ancestral bacteria a type of rnase p rna and 66% of which have no close homolog to known prokaryotic rnase p rna.


CONCLUSIONS
the combination of efficient filtering by means of a descriptor-based search and subsequent construction of a high-quality gene model by means of a covariance model provides an efficient method for the detection of rnase p rna genes in large-scale sequencing data.

bcheck is implemented as webserver and can also be downloaded for local use from http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/bcheck
