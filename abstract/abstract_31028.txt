BACKGROUND
metabolic reconstruction is the computational-based process that aims to elucidate the network of metabolites interconnected through reactions catalyzed by activities assigned to one or more genes. reconstructed models may contain inconsistencies that appear as gap metabolites and blocked reactions. although automatic methods for solving this problem have been previously developed, there are many situations where manual curation is still needed.


RESULTS
we introduce a general definition of gap metabolite that allows its detection in a straightforward manner. moreover, a method for the detection of unconnected modules, defined as isolated sets of blocked reactions connected through gap metabolites, is proposed. the method has been successfully applied to the curation of icg <dig>  the genome-scale metabolic model for the bacterium blattabacterium cuenoti, obligate endosymbiont of cockroaches.


CONCLUSIONS
we found the proposed approach to be a valuable tool for the curation of genome-scale metabolic models. the outcome of its application to the genome-scale model b. cuenoti icg <dig> is a more accurate model version named as b. cuenoti imp <dig>
