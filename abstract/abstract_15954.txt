BACKGROUND
steroid responsive meningitis-arteritis  is a common cause of inflammation of the canine central nervous system . to investigate if transforming growth factor beta  <dig> , interleukin- <dig>  and vascular endothelial growth factor  are involved in the production of excessive immunoglobulin a , the induction of acute phase proteins and in the development of a systemic necrotizing vasculitis, characteristic of srma, these three signalling proteins were evaluated.


RESULTS
cerebrospinal fluid  and serum samples of dogs during the acute phase of srma  were tested for il- <dig>  vegf and tgf- β <dig>  results were compared to those of dogs affected with srma during treatment  and during relapse , to dogs with other meningoencephalomyelitides , with miscellaneous non-inflammatory diseases of the cns , with idiopathic epilepsy , with systemic inflammatory diseases  and with healthy dogs . concentrations of il- <dig> and vegf in csf were significantly elevated in the srma group compared to the other disease categories . the csf concentrations of tgf-β <dig> were increased in srma group, but statistically significant differences were found only in comparison with healthy and cns-mix groups. no differences were detected in the serum concentrations of tgf-β <dig> between the different groups. in untreated srma patients, a positive correlation  between concentrations of tgf-β <dig> and iga concentration was found in csf, while concentrations of il- <dig> and vegf in csf positively correlated with the degree of pleocytosis .


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that these three signalling proteins are biomarkers of disease activity in srma. vegf might play an important role in the development of a systemic arteritis. tgf-β <dig> is considered to be involved in the excessive iga production, while il- <dig> in the pleocytosis. the combined intrathecal increase of tgf-β <dig> and il- <dig> detected in srma could possibly force cd <dig> progenitors to differentiate towards the newly described th <dig> lymphocyte subset and enhance the autoimmune response.
