BACKGROUND
chromohalobacter salexigens  is a halophilic extremophile with a very broad salinity range and is used as a model organism to elucidate prokaryotic osmoadaptation due to its strong euryhaline phenotype.


RESULTS
c. salexigens dsm 3043's metabolism was reconstructed based on genomic, biochemical and physiological information via a non-automated but iterative process. this manually-curated reconstruction accounts for  <dig> genes,  <dig> reactions, and  <dig> metabolites. by using flux balance analysis, the model was extensively validated against literature data on the c. salexigens phenotypic features, the transport and use of different substrates for growth as well as against experimental observations on the uptake and accumulation of industrially important organic osmolytes, ectoine, betaine, and its precursor choline, which play important roles in the adaptive response to osmotic stress.


CONCLUSIONS
this work presents the first comprehensive genome-scale metabolic model of a halophilic bacterium. being a useful guide for identification and filling of knowledge gaps, the reconstructed metabolic network ioa <dig> will accelerate the research on halophilic bacteria towards application of systems biology approaches and design of metabolic engineering strategies.
