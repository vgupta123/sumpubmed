BACKGROUND
it is well established that pd- <dig> is expressed by follicular t cells but its function in regulation of human t helper cells has been unclear. we investigated the expression modality and function of pd- <dig> expressed by human t cells specialized in helping b cells.


RESULTS
we found that pd-1-expressing t cells are heterogeneous in pd- <dig> expression. we identified three different pd-1-expressing memory t cell subsets , pd-1medium , and pd-1high  cells). pd-1+++ t cells expressed cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig> and were localized in the rim of germinal centers. pd-1+ or pd-1++ cells expressed ccr <dig> and were present mainly in the t cell area or other parts of the b cell follicles. utilizing a novel antigen density-dependent magnetic sorting  method, we isolated the three t cell subsets for functional characterization. the germinal center-located pd-1+++ t cells were most efficient in helping b cells and in producing il- <dig> and cxcl <dig>  other pd-1-expressing t cells, enriched with th <dig> and th <dig> cells, were less efficient than pd-1+++ t cells in these capacities. pd-1+++ t cells highly expressed ki- <dig> and therefore appear active in cell activation and proliferation in vivo. il- <dig> is a cytokine important for proliferation and survival of the pd-1+++ t cells. in contrast, il- <dig>  while a major effector cytokine produced by the pd-1-expressing t helper cells, had no function in generation, survival, or proliferation of the pd-1-expressing helper t cells at least in vitro. pd- <dig> triggering has a suppressive effect on the proliferation and b cell-helping function of pd-1+++ germinal center t cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our results revealed the phenotype and effector function of pd-1-expressing t helper cell subsets and indicate that pd- <dig> restrains the b cell-helping function of germinal center-localized t cells to prevent excessive antibody response.
