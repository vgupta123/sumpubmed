BACKGROUND
the fra-1/ap- <dig> transcription factor regulates the expression of genes controlling various processes including migration, invasion, and survival as well as extracellular remodeling. we recently demonstrated that loss of fra- <dig> leads to exacerbated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, accompanied by enhanced expression of various inflammatory and fibrotic genes. to better understand the molecular mechanisms by which fra- <dig> confers protection during bleomycin-induced lung injury, genome-wide mrna expression profiling was performed.


RESULTS
we found that fra- <dig> regulates gene expression programs that include: 1) several cytokines and chemokines involved in inflammation, 2) several genes involved in the extracellular remodeling and cell adhesion, and 3) several genes involved in programmed cell death.


CONCLUSIONS
loss of fra- <dig> leads to the enhanced expression of genes regulating inflammation and immune responses and decreased the expression of genes involved in apoptosis, suggesting that this transcription factor distinctly modulates early pro-fibrotic cellular responses.
