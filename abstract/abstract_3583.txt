BACKGROUND
the shc isoforms is known to mediate immune responses and has been indicated as a negative regulator of autoimmunity and lymphocyte activation. we aimed to evaluate the immune-regulatory role of shc in rat bone marrow-derived dcs in the maturation process triggered by lps.


RESULTS
we found that, in response to lps, expression of shc proteins was induced and that neutralization of shc inhibited the lps-induced transient phosphorylation of p52shc on ptyr239/ <dig> in dcs of lewis  rats. moreover, the significantly enhanced expression of il- <dig> and the surface level of costimulatory molecule cd <dig>  as well as suppressed expression of il- <dig> and il- <dig> in the shc-silenced dcs were also observed. similar iκb phosphorylation occurred in shc-silenced dcs primed by lps, indicating shc is not associated with nf-κb pathway. we further demonstrate that shc blockade on lps-treated dcs results in significant increase of the overall stat <dig> phosphorylation and the relative levels of phospho-stat <dig> in the nuclear fraction. stat <dig> activation by lps with or without shc blockade was totally abolished by su <dig>  a selective src family kinases inhibitor, underscoring the critical role of src-mediated activation.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that shc blockade in lps-primed dc leads to the development of tolerogenic dc via src-dependent stat <dig> activation and that adaptor protein shc might play a pivotal role in mediating immunogenic and tolerogenic properties of dcs.
