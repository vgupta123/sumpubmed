BACKGROUND
stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase  is a key enzyme that catalyses the conversion of stearoyl-acyl carrier protein  to oleoyl-acp, a precursor for the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids. zmsad <dig>  is a major qtl for stearic acid content in maize seeds. to investigate the biological function and the application potential of maize zmsad <dig> in oil biosynthesis, we isolated the full-length zmsad <dig> cdna from maize b <dig> and overexpressed it in arabidopsis and maize.


RESULTS
under seed-specific overexpression of zmsad <dig> in arabidopsis, the stearic acid content and the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in the seeds were significantly decreased relative to those in the control. conversely, in transgenic zmsad <dig> rnai arabidopsis seeds, the contents of stearic acid and long-chain saturated acids and the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids were significantly increased; in addition, the oleic acid content was significantly decreased. more importantly, transgenic zmsad <dig> maize that expressed high levels of zmsad <dig> in its mature seeds showed reduced stearic acid content  and a lower saturated to unsaturated fatty acid ratio  relative to those  of the control. conversely, down-regulation of zmsad <dig> in maize resulted in increased levels of stearic acid , long-chain saturated acids  and the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids  relative to those  of the control, whereas the oleic acid  level was significantly decreased relative to that  of the control.


CONCLUSIONS
our work demonstrates that the contents of stearic acid, oleic acid, and long-chain saturated acids, and the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids, are modified in maize seeds by seed-specific overexpression or down-regulation of zmsad <dig>  therefore, the zmsad <dig> gene is a useful tool for engineering the seed oil composition in maize and other crops.
