BACKGROUND
the role of il- <dig> and pre-tcr signaling during t cell development has been well characterized in murine but not in human system. we and others have reported that human bm hematopoietic progenitor cells  display poor proliferation, inefficient double negative  to double positive  transition and no functional maturation in the in vitro op9-delta-like  <dig>  culture system.


RESULTS
in this study, we investigated the importance of optimal il- <dig> and pre-tcr signaling during adult human t cell development. using a modified op9-dl <dig> culture ectopically expressing il- <dig> and fms-like tyrosine kinase  <dig> ligand , we demonstrated enhanced t cell precursor expansion. il- <dig> removal at various time points during t cell development promoted a slight increase of dp cells; however, these cells did not differentiate further and underwent cell death. as pre-tcr signaling rescues dn cells from programmed cell death, we treated the culture with anti-cd <dig> antibody. upon pre-tcr stimulation, the il- <dig> deprived t precursors differentiated into cd3+tcrαβ+dp cells and further matured into functional cd <dig> t cells, albeit displayed a skewed tcr vβ repertoire.


CONCLUSIONS
our study establishes for the first time a critical control for differentiation and maturation of adult human t cells from hpcs by concomitant regulation of il- <dig> and pre-tcr signaling.
