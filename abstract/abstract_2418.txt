BACKGROUND
domains are basic units of proteins, and thus exploring associations between protein domains and human inherited diseases will greatly improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of human complex diseases and further benefit the medical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. within a given domain-domain interaction network, we make the assumption that similarities of disease phenotypes can be explained using proximities of domains associated with such diseases. based on this assumption, we propose a bayesian regression approach named "domainrbf"  to prioritize candidate domains for human complex diseases.


RESULTS
using a compiled dataset containing  <dig>  associations between  <dig> domains and  <dig>  disease phenotypes, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through three large-scale leave-one-out cross-validation experiments , and we do so in terms of three criteria . we further show that the proposed approach is robust to the parameters involved and the underlying domain-domain interaction network through a series of permutation tests. once having assessed the validity of this approach, we show the possibility of ab initio inference of domain-disease associations and gene-disease associations, and we illustrate the strong agreement between our inferences and the evidences from genome-wide association studies for four common diseases . finally, we provide a pre-calculated genome-wide landscape of associations between  <dig>  protein domains and  <dig>  human diseases and offer free access to this resource.


CONCLUSIONS
the proposed approach effectively ranks susceptible domains among the top of the candidates, and it is robust to the parameters involved. the ab initio inference of domain-disease associations shows strong agreement with the evidence provided by genome-wide association studies. the predicted landscape provides a comprehensive understanding of associations between domains and human diseases.
