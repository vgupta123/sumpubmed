BACKGROUND
biofilm production is an important mechanism for bacterial survival and its association with antimicrobial resistance represents a challenge for the patient treatment. in this study we evaluated the in vitro action of macrolides in combination with anti-pseudomonal agents on biofilm-grown pseudomonas aeruginosa recovered from cystic fibrosis  patients.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> isolates were analysed. the biofilm inhibitory concentration  results were consistently higher than those obtained by the conventional method, minimal inhibitory concentration,  for most anti-pseudomonal agents tested . when macrolides were associated with the anti-pseudomonal agents, the bic values were reduced significantly for ceftazidime  and tobramycin , regardless the concentration of macrolides. strong inhibitory quotient was observed when azithromycin at  <dig> mg/l was associated with all anti-pseudomonal agents tested in biofilm conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
p. aeruginosa from cf patients within biofilms are highly resistant to antibiotics but macrolides proved to augment the in vitro activity of anti-pseudomonal agents.
