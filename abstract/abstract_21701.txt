BACKGROUND
bacillus anthracis is an animal and human pathogen whose virulence is characterized by lethal and edema toxin, as well as a poly-glutamic acid capsule. in addition to these well characterized toxins, b. anthracis secretes several proteases and phospholipases, and a newly described toxin of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin  family, anthrolysin o .


RESULTS
in the present studies we show that recombinant alo  or native alo, secreted by viable b. anthracis, is lethal to human primary polymorphonuclear leukocytes , monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages , lymphocytes, thp- <dig> monocytic human cell line and me- <dig>  detroit  <dig>  and a <dig> epithelial cells by trypan blue exclusion or lactate dehydrogenase  release viability assays. alo cytotoxicity is dose and time dependent and susceptibility to alo-mediated lysis differs between cell types. in addition, the viability of monocytes and hmdms was assayed in the presence of vegetative sterne strains  <dig> , ut <dig> , and a complemented strain expressing alo, ut <dig> , and was dependent upon the expression of alo. cytotoxicity of ralo is seen as low as  <dig>  nm in the absence of serum. all direct cytotoxic activity is inhibited by the addition of cholesterol or serum concentration as low as 10%.


CONCLUSIONS
the lethality of ralo and native alo on human monocytes, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes supports the idea that alo may represent a previously unidentified virulence factor of b. anthracis. the study of other factors produced by b. anthracis, along with the major anthrax toxins, will lead to a better understanding of this bacterium's pathogenesis, as well as provide information for the development of antitoxin vaccines for treating and preventing anthrax.
