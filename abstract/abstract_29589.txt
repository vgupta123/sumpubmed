BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a class of small non-coding regulatory rnas that regulate gene expression by guiding target mrna cleavage or translational inhibition. mirnas can have large-scale regulatory effects on development and stress response in plants.


RESULTS
to test whether mirnas play roles in regulating response to powdery mildew infection and heat stress in wheat, by using solexa high-throughput sequencing we cloned the small rna from wheat leaves infected by preponderant physiological strain erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici  or by heat stress treatment. a total of  <dig> mirnas were identified, which belong to  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirna families. we found that  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were responsive to powdery mildew infection and heat stress, respectively. we further predicted that  <dig> target genes were potentially regulated by the novel wheat mirna.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicated that diverse set of wheat mirnas were responsive to powdery mildew infection and heat stress and could function in wheat responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses.
