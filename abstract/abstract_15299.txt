BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  induces one of most important devastating disease of swine worldwide, and the current methods poorly control it. previous studies have indicated that the nonstructural protein  <dig>  of prrsv may be an important protein for the immune escape of prrsv.


RESULTS
here, we firstly explored the effect of over-expression of nsp <dig> on prrsv infection and found that over-expression of nsp <dig> enhanced the prrsv titers while the small interfering rna  specifically targeting nsp <dig> could reduce the prrsv titers in marc- <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, prrsv nsp <dig> promotes prrsv infection in marc- <dig> cells and sirnas targeting nsp <dig> may be a potential therapeutic strategy to control prrsv in future.
