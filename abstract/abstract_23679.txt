BACKGROUND
rna interference  mediated by small interfering rnas  or short hairpin rnas  has become a powerful technique for eukaryotic gene knockdown. sirna gc-content negatively correlates with rnai efficiency, and it is of interest to have a convincing mechanistic interpretation of this observation. we here examine this issue by considering the secondary structures for both the target messenger rna  and the sirna guide strand.


RESULTS
by analyzing a unique homogeneous data set of  <dig> shrnas targeted to  <dig> endogenous human genes, we find that: 1) target site accessibility is more important than gc-content for efficient rnai; 2) there is an appreciable negative correlation between gc-content and rnai activity; 3) for the predicted structure of the sirna guide strand, there is a lack of correlation between rnai activity and either the stability or the number of free dangling nucleotides at an end of the structure; 4) there is a high correlation between target site accessibility and gc-content. for a set of representative structural rnas, the gc content of  <dig> % for paired bases is significantly higher than the gc content of  <dig> % for unpaired bases. thus, for a structured rna, a region with higher gc content is likely to have more stable secondary structure. furthermore, by partial correlation analysis, the correlation for gc-content is almost completely diminished, when the effect of target accessibility is controlled.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings provide a target-structure-based interpretation and mechanistic insight for the effect of gc-content on rnai efficiency.
