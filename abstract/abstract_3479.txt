BACKGROUND
lactobacillus species can contribute positively to general and oral health and are frequently acquired by breastfeeding in infancy. the present study aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in breast and formula-fed  <dig> month-old infants and to evaluate potential probiotic properties of the dominant lactobacillus species detected. saliva and oral swab samples were collected from  <dig> infants who were enrolled in a longitudinal study  examining the effect of a new infant formula on child growth and development. saliva was cultured and lactobacillus isolates were identified from 16s rrna gene sequences. five l. gasseri isolates that differed in 16s rrna sequence were tested for their ability to inhibit growth of selected oral bacteria and for adhesion to oral tissues. oral swab samples were analyzed by qpcr for lactobacillus gasseri.


RESULTS
 <dig>  infants were breastfed and  <dig>  were formula-fed with either a standard formula  or formula supplemented with a milk fat globule membrane  fraction . lactobacilli were cultured from saliva of  <dig> % breastfed infants, but only in  <dig> % of the standard and  <dig> % of the mfgm supplemented formula-fed infants. l. gasseri was the most prevalent  of six lactobacillus species detected. l. gasseri isolates inhibited streptococcus mutans binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite, and inhibited growth of s. mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces oris, candida albicans and fusobacterium nucleatum in a concentration dependent fashion. l. gasseri isolates bound to parotid and submandibular saliva, salivary gp <dig> and muc <dig>  and purified mfgm, and adhered to epithelial cells. l. gasseri was detected by qpcr in  <dig> % of the oral swabs. breastfed infants had significantly higher mean dna levels of l. gasseri  than infants fed the standard  or mfgm  formula.


CONCLUSIONS
lactobacilli colonized the oral cavity of breastfed infants significantly more frequently than formula-fed infants. the dominant lactobacillus was l. gasseri, which was detected at higher levels in breastfed than formula-fed infants and displayed probiotic traits in vitro.
