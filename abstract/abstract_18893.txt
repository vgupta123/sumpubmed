BACKGROUND
rapeseed  has spring and winter genotypes adapted to different growing seasons. winter genotypes do not flower before the onset of winter, thus leading to a longer vegetative growth period that promotes the accumulation and allocation of more resources to seed production. the development of winter genotypes enabled the rapeseed to spread rapidly from southern to northern europe and other temperate regions of the world. the molecular basis underlying the evolutionary transition from spring- to winter- type rapeseed is not known, however, and needs to be elucidated.


RESULTS
we fine-mapped the spring environment specific quantitative trait locus  for flowering time, qft10- <dig> in a doubled haploid  mapping population of rapeseed derived from a cross between tapidor  and ningyou <dig>  and delimited the qft10- <dig> to an 80-kb region on chromosome a <dig> of b. napus. the bnflc.a <dig> gene, an ortholog of flowering locus c  in arabidopsis, was cloned from the qtl. we identified  <dig> polymorphic sites between bnflc.a <dig> parental alleles of the tn-dh population in the upstream region and in intron  <dig>  expression of both bnflc.a <dig> alleles decreased during vernalization, but decreased more slowly in the winter parent tapidor. haplotyping and association analysis showed that one of the polymorphic sites upstream of bnflc.a <dig> is strongly associated with the vernalization requirement of rapeseed . this polymorphic site is derived from a tourist-like miniature inverted-repeat transposable element  insertion/deletion in the upstream region of bnflc.a <dig>  the mite sequence was not present in the bnflc.a <dig> gene in spring-type rapeseed, nor in ancestral ‘a’ genome species b. rapa genotypes. our results suggest that the insertion may have occurred in winter rapeseed after b. napus speciation.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings strongly suggest that  bnflc.a <dig> is the gene underlying qft10- <dig>  the qtl for phenotypic diversity of flowering time in the tn-dh population,  the allelic diversity caused by mite insertion/deletion upstream of bnflc.a <dig> is one of the major causes of differentiation of winter and spring genotypes in rapeseed and  winter rapeseed has evolved from spring genotypes through selection pressure at the bnflc.a <dig> locus, enabling expanded cultivation of rapeseed along the route of brassica domestication.
