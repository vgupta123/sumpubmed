BACKGROUND
whole genome radiation hybrid  maps serve as "scaffolds" to significantly improve the orientation of small bacterial artificial chromosome  contigs, order genes within the contigs and assist assembly of a sequence-ready map for virtually any species. here, we report the construction of a porcine: human comparative map for pig  chromosome  <dig>  using the imnprh <dig> -rad porcine wg-rh panel, integrated with the imprh7000-rad wg-rh, genetic and bac fingerprinted contig  maps.


RESULTS
map vectors from the imnprh <dig> -rad and imprh <dig> -rad panels were merged to construct parallel framework  maps, within which fw markers common to both panels have an identical order. this strategy reduced map discrepancies between the two panels and significantly improved map accuracy. a total of  <dig> markers, including  <dig> microsatellites ,  <dig> genes and ests, and  <dig> bac end sequences , were ordered within two linkage groups at two point  lod score of  <dig>  one linkage group covers ssc10p with accumulated map distances of  <dig>  cr <dig>  and  <dig>  cr <dig> , respectively. the second group covers ssc10q at map distances of  <dig>  cr <dig>  and  <dig>  cr <dig> , yielding an overall average map resolution of  <dig>  kb/cr <dig>  or  <dig>  kb per marker on ssc <dig>  this represents a ~ <dig> -fold increase in map resolution over the imprh <dig> -rad panel. based on  <dig> porcine markers that have homologous sequences in the human genome, a detailed comparative map between ssc <dig> and human  chromosome   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> was built.


CONCLUSIONS
this initial comparative rh map of ssc <dig> refines the syntenic regions between ssc <dig> and hsa <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  it integrates the imnprh <dig> -rad and imprh <dig> -rad, genetic and bac fpc maps and provides a scaffold to close potential gaps between contigs prior to genome sequencing and assembly. this map is also useful in fine mapping of qtls on ssc <dig>
