BACKGROUND
ophthalmic antibiotic therapy in large animals is often used empirically because of the lack of pharmacokinetics studies. the purpose of the study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of topical tobramycin  <dig> % ophthalmic solution in the tears of normal horses using an automated immunoassay analysis.


RESULTS
the mean tobramycin concentrations in the tears at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> minutes and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> hours after administration were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   mg/l. mean tobramycin concentration was maintained above the mic <dig> for commonly isolated bacteria for  <dig>  min.


CONCLUSIONS
a single dose of topical tobramycin resulted in therapeutic concentrations of tobramycin in the tears for  <dig> h after administration. therapeutic levels of tobramycin remained in equine tears  <dig> times longer than was reported in rabbit tears.
