BACKGROUND
stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a ubiquitous gram-negative bacterium previously named as xanthomonas maltophilia. this organism is an important nosocomial pathogen associated with infections in immunocompromised patients. clinical isolates of s. maltophilia are mostly resistant to multiple antibiotics and treatment of its infections is becoming problematic. several virulent bacteriophages, but not temperate phage, of s. maltophilia have been characterized.


RESULTS
in this study, a temperate myophage of s. maltophilia  was isolated and characterized. sequence analysis showed that its genome is  <dig> -bp long with  <dig> open reading frames . its similarity to p2-like phages and prophages in s. maltophilia and several xanthomonas pathovars includes genomic organization, arrangement of several operons, and possession of a slippery sequence t7g for translational frameshifting in tail assembly genes. smp <dig> encodes a tyrosine family integrase that shares low degrees of similarity with those of other phages and a lysin belonging to family  <dig> chitinase that is observed in plants and some bacteria, although not in phages. trna are the preferred sites for host integration of smp <dig> and the related phages: trna-thr for smp <dig> and prophage of s. maltophilia k279a; trna-lys for prophages of x. campestris pv. campestris atcc <dig>  x. oryzae pv. oryzae strains maff <dig>  and kacc10331; and trna-asn for prophage of x. oryzae pv. oryzae pxo99a and remnant of x. axonopodis pv. citri  <dig>  regions flanking the prophages are varied highly in nucleotide sequence and rich in transposase genes, suggesting that frequent insertion/excision had occurred.


CONCLUSIONS
prevalence of closely related prophages in stenotrophomonas and xanthomonads may have contributed to the diversity of these closely related species owing to possible horizontal gene transfer mediated by the phages.
