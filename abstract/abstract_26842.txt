BACKGROUND
bac-based physical maps provide for sequencing across an entire genome or a selected sub-genomic region of biological interest. such a region can be approached with next-generation whole-genome sequencing and assembly as if it were an independent small genome. using the minimum tiling path as a guide, specific bac clones representing the prioritized genomic interval are selected, pooled, and used to prepare a sequencing library.


RESULTS
this pooled bac approach was taken to sequence and assemble a qtl-rich region, of ~ <dig> mbp and represented by twenty-seven bacs, on linkage group  <dig> of the theobroma cacao cv. matina 1- <dig> genome. using various mixtures of read coverages from paired-end and linear  <dig> libraries, multiple assemblies of varied quality were generated. quality was assessed by comparing the assembly of  <dig> reads with a subset of ten bacs individually sequenced and assembled using sanger reads. a mixture of reads optimal for assembly was identified. we found, furthermore, that a quality assembly suitable for serving as a reference genome template could be obtained even with a reduced depth of sequencing coverage. annotation of the resulting assembly revealed several genes potentially responsible for three t. cacao traits: black pod disease resistance, bean shape index, and pod weight.


CONCLUSIONS
our results, as with other pooled bac sequencing reports, suggest that pooling portions of a minimum tiling path derived from a bac-based physical map is an effective method to target sub-genomic regions for sequencing. while we focused on a single qtl region, other qtl regions of importance could be similarly sequenced allowing for biological discovery to take place before a high quality whole-genome assembly is completed.
