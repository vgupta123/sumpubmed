BACKGROUND
starch serves as a temporal storage of carbohydrates in plant leaves during day/night cycles. to study transcriptional regulatory modules of this dynamic metabolic process, we conducted gene regulation network analysis based on small-sample inference of graphical gaussian model .


RESULTS
time-series significant analysis was applied for arabidopsis leaf transcriptome data to obtain a set of genes that are highly regulated under a diurnal cycle. a total of  <dig>  diurnally regulated genes included  <dig> starch metabolic enzymes,  <dig> clock-associated genes, and  <dig> transcription factors . a starch-clock-tf gene regulation network comprising  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges was constructed by ggm from these  <dig> significant genes that are potentially related to the diurnal control of starch metabolism. from this network, we found that Î²-amylase  <dig> , which participates in starch degradation in chloroplast, is the most frequently connected gene . the robustness of gene-to-gene regulatory network was further analyzed by tf binding site prediction and by evaluating global co-expression of tfs and target starch metabolic enzymes. as a result, two tfs, indeterminate domain  <dig>  and constans-like , were identified as positive regulators of starch synthase  <dig> . the inference model of atidd5-dependent positive regulation of ss <dig> gene expression was experimentally supported by decreased ss <dig> mrna accumulation in atidd <dig> mutant plants during the light period of both short and long day conditions. col was also shown to positively control ss <dig> mrna accumulation. furthermore, the knockout of atidd <dig> and col led to deformation of chloroplast and its contained starch granules. this deformity also affected the number of starch granules per chloroplast, which increased significantly in both knockout mutant lines.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we utilized a systematic approach of microarray analysis to discover the transcriptional regulatory network of starch metabolism in arabidopsis leaves. with this inference method, the starch regulatory network of arabidopsis was found to be strongly associated with clock genes and tfs, of which atidd <dig> and col were evidenced to control ss <dig> gene expression and starch granule formation in chloroplasts.
