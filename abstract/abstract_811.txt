BACKGROUND
the severity of angiographically assessed coronary artery disease may be the factor that influences the degree of brain damage during on-pump surgery. modern technology such as computed electroencephalography  that is used to detect signs of brain damage could also be used to determine the advantages and disadvantages of various surgical myocardial revascularization methods in certain categories of patients. the present study investigated eeg power dynamics for  <dig> postoperative month in patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting  who were divided into two groups: those with moderate coronary lesions  and those with severe coronary lesions .


RESULTS
at 7–10 days after cabg, all patients showed theta type  <dig> rhythm power higher than that seen preoperatively, possibly indicating that brain damage occurred during bypass. at 1 month after cabg, the theta type  <dig> rhythm power had decreased to the baseline level in patients with syntax scores of ≤ <dig>  whereas it had increased in patients with syntax scores ≥ <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
syntax scores ≥  <dig> are associated with eeg markers of perioperative brain damage during cabg. careful preoperative assessment, preparation, and more effective intraoperative brain protection are essential for this category of coronary heart disease  patients.
