BACKGROUND
inhibited temperament - the predisposition to respond to new people, places or things with wariness or avoidance behaviors - is associated with increased risk for social anxiety disorder and major depression. although the magnitude of the amygdala's response to novelty has been identified as a neural substrate of inhibited temperament, there may also be differences in temporal dynamics . we hypothesized that persons with inhibited temperament would have faster responses to novel relative to familiar neutral faces compared to persons with uninhibited temperament. we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure the temporal dynamics of the blood oxygen level dependent  response to both novel and familiar neutral faces in participants with inhibited or uninhibited temperament.


RESULTS
inhibited participants had faster amygdala responses to novel compared with familiar faces, and both longer and greater amygdala response to all faces. there were no differences in peak response.


CONCLUSIONS
faster amygdala response to novelty may reflect a computational bias that leads to greater neophobic responses and represents a mechanism for the development of social anxiety.
