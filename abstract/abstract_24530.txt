BACKGROUND
definitive endoderm  gives rise to the respiratory apparatus and digestive tract. sox <dig> and cxcr <dig> are useful markers of the de. previously, we identified a novel de marker, decay accelerating factor  <dig>  by identifying de specific genes from the expression profile of de derived from mouse embryonic stem cells  by microarray analysis, and in situ hybridization of early embryos. daf <dig> is expressed in a subpopulation of e-cadherin + cxcr4+ de cells. the characteristics of the daf1-expressing cells during de differentiation has not been examined.


RESULTS
in this report, we utilized the esc differentiation system to examine the characteristics of daf1-expressing de cells. we found that daf <dig> expression could discriminate late de from early de. early de cells are daf1-negative  and late de cells are daf1-positive . we also found that daf1+ late de cells show low proliferative and low cell matrix adhesive characteristics. furthermore, the purified sox17low early de cells gave rise to daf1+ sox17high late de cells.


CONCLUSIONS
daf1-expressing late definitive endoderm proliferates slowly and show low adhesive capacity.
