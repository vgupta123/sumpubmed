BACKGROUND
deciphering cis-regulatory networks has become an attractive yet challenging task. this paper presents a simple method for cis-regulatory network discovery which aims to avoid some of the common problems of previous approaches.


RESULTS
using promoter sequences and gene expression profiles as input, rather than clustering the genes by the expression data, our method utilizes co-expression neighborhood information for each individual gene, thereby overcoming the disadvantages of current clustering based models which may miss specific information for individual genes. in addition, rather than using a motif database as an input, it implements a simple motif count table for each enumerated k-mer for each gene promoter sequence. thus, it can be used for species where previous knowledge of cis-regulatory motifs is unknown and has the potential to discover new transcription factor binding sites. applications on saccharomyces cerevisiae and arabidopsis have shown that our method has a good prediction accuracy and outperforms a phylogenetic footprinting approach. furthermore, the top ranked gene-motif regulatory clusters are evidently functionally co-regulated, and the regulatory relationships between the motifs and the enriched biological functions can often be confirmed by literature.


CONCLUSIONS
since this method is simple and gene-specific, it can be readily utilized for insufficiently studied species or flexibly used as an additional step or data source for previous transcription regulatory networks discovery models.
