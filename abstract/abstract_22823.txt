BACKGROUND
in recent years, genome-wide association studies have successfully uncovered single-nucleotide polymorphisms  associated with complex traits such as diseases and quantitative phenotypes. these variations account for a small proportion of heritability. with the development of high throughput techniques, abundant submicroscopic structural variations have been found in organisms, of which the main variations are copy number variations . therefore, cnvs are increasingly recognized as an important and abundant source of genetic variation and phenotypic diversity.


RESULTS
analyses of cnvs in the genomes of three sheep breeds were performed using the ovine snp <dig> beadchip array. a total of  <dig> cnv regions  were identified, including  <dig> losses,  <dig> gains, and six with both events , which cover  <dig>  mb of the sheep genomic sequence and correspond to  <dig> % of the autosomal genome sequence. the length of the cnvrs on autosomes range from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  mb with a mean size of  <dig>  kb, and  <dig> cnvrs events had a frequency > 3%. among these cnvrs,  <dig> cnvrs identified by the penncnv overlapped with the cnvpartition. functional analysis indicated that most genes in the cnvrs were significantly enriched for involvement in the environmental response. furthermore,  <dig> cnvrs were selected for validation and  <dig> cnvrs were further experimentally confirmed by qpcr. in addition, there were  <dig> cnvrs overlapped in our new dataset and other published ruminant cnv studies.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we firstly constructed a sheep cnv map based on the ovine snp <dig> array. our results demonstrated the differences of two detection tools and integration of multiple algorithms can enhance the detection of sheep genomic structure variations. furthermore, our findings would be of help for understanding the sheep genome and provide preliminary foundation for carrying out the cnvs association studies with economically important phenotypes of sheep in the future.
