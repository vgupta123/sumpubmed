BACKGROUND
it is well established that adipose tissue plays a key role in energy storage and release but is also a secretory organ and a source of stem cells. among different lineages, stem cells are able to differentiate into adipocytes and osteoblasts. as secreted proteins could regulate the balance between both lineages, we aimed at characterizing the secretome of human multipotent adipose-derived stem cell  at an early step of commitment to adipocytes and osteoblasts.


RESULTS
a proteomic approach, using mono-dimensional electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry, allowed us to identify a total of  <dig> proteins at day  <dig> and day  <dig> of adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation. analysis of identified proteins showed that  <dig> % corresponded to classical secreted proteins characterized by a signal peptide, that  <dig> % previously described in the extracellular compartment were devoid of signal peptide and that  <dig> % neither exhibited a signal peptide nor had been previously described extracellularly. these proteins were classified into  <dig> clusters according to their function. quantitative analysis has been performed for  <dig> candidates: pai- <dig>  pedf, bigh <dig>  ptx <dig>  sparc, eno <dig>  grp <dig> and mmp <dig>  among them, pai- <dig> was detected at day  <dig> and day  <dig> of osteoblast differentiation but never in adipocyte secretome. furthermore we showed that pai- <dig> mrna was down-regulated in the bone of ovariectomized mice.


CONCLUSIONS
given its regulation during the early events of hmads cell differentiation and its status in ovariectomized mice, pai- <dig> could play a role in the adipocyte/osteoblast balance and thus in bone diseases such as osteoporosis.
