BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small rna molecules that play important regulatory roles in plant development and stress responses. identification of stress-regulated mirnas is crucial for understanding how plants respond to environmental stimuli. abiotic stresses are one of the major factors that limit crop growth and yield. whereas abiotic stress-regulated mirnas have been identified in vegetative tissues in several plants, they are not well studied in reproductive tissues such as inflorescences.


RESULTS
we used illumina deep sequencing technology to sequence four small rna libraries that were constructed from the inflorescences of rice plants that were grown under control condition and drought, cold, or salt stress. we identified  <dig> mirnas that belong to  <dig> families, including  <dig> mirnas that are not present in the mirbase. we validated  <dig> mirnas  using published small rna expression data in dcl <dig>  dcl <dig>  and rdr <dig> rnai lines and confirmed  <dig> targets from  <dig> mirnas using published degradome data. by comparing the expression levels of mirnas, we identified  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mirnas that were regulated by drought, cold and salt stress conditions, respectively. in addition, we identified  <dig> candidate mirnas that originated from transposable elements or repeats, especially miniature inverted-repeat elements .


CONCLUSIONS
we discovered novel mirnas and stress-regulated mirnas that may play critical roles in stress response in rice inflorescences. transposable elements or repeats, especially mites, are rich sources for mirna origination.
