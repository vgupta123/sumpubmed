BACKGROUND
proliferation and tumor differentiation captured by the genomic grade index  are important prognostic indicators in breast cancer  especially for the estrogen receptor positive  disease. the aims of this study were to convert this microarray index to a qrt-pcr assay , which could be realized on formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples , and to assess its prognostic performance and predictive value of clinical benefit in early and advanced er+ bc patients treated with tamoxifen.

methods
the accuracy and concordance of the pcr-ggi with the ggi was assessed using bc patients for which frozen and ffpe tissues as well as microarray data were available . the evaluation of the prognostic value of the pcr-ggi was assessed on ffpe material using a consecutive series of  <dig> systemically treated early bc patients. the predictive performance for tamoxifen benefit was assessed using two er+ bc populations treated either with adjuvant tamoxifen only  or first-line tamoxifen for advanced disease .


RESULTS
the pcr-ggi is based on the expression of  <dig> genes . a significant correlation was observed between the microarray-derived ggi and the qrt-pcr assay using frozen  and ffpe material . the prognostic performance of the pcr-ggi was confirmed on ffpe samples . the pcr-ggi further identified two subgroups of patients with statistically different time to distant metastasis free survival  across the two cohorts of er+ bc patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. additionally, the pcr-ggi was associated with response to tamoxifen in the advanced setting .


CONCLUSIONS
pcr-ggi recapitulates in an accurate and reproducible manner the performances of the ggi using frozen and ffpe samples.
