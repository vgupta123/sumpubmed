BACKGROUND
individual differences between human embryonic stem cell  lines are poorly understood. here, we describe the derivation of five hesc lines  from frozen-thawed human embryos and compare their individual differentiation characteristic.


RESULTS
the cell lines were cultured either on human or mouse feeder cells. the cells grew significantly faster and could be passaged enzymatically only on mouse feeders. however, this was found to lead to chromosomal instability after prolonged culture. all hesc lines expressed the established markers of pluripotent cells as well as several primordial germ cell  marker genes in a uniform manner. however, the cell lines showed distinct features in their spontaneous differentiation patterns. the embryoid body  formation frequency of fes  <dig> cell line was significantly lower than that of other lines and cells within the ebs differentiated less readily. likewise, teratomas derived from fes  <dig> cells were constantly cystic and showed only minor solid tissue formation with a monotonous differentiation pattern as compared with the other lines.


CONCLUSIONS
hesc lines may differ substantially in their differentiation properties although they appear similar in the undifferentiated state.
