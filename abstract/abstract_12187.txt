BACKGROUND
genomic datasets accompanying scientific publications show a surprisingly high rate of gene name corruption. this error is generated when files and tables are imported into microsoft excel and certain gene symbols are automatically converted into dates.


RESULTS
we have developed truke, a fexible web tool to detect, tag and fix, if possible, such misconversions. aside, truke is language and regional locale-aware, providing file format customization  following user’s preferences.


CONCLUSIONS
truke is a data format conversion tool with a unique corrupted gene symbol detection utility. truke is freely available without registration at http://maplab.cat/truke.
