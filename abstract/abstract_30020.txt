BACKGROUND
rna-binding proteins participate in many important biological processes concerning rna-mediated gene regulation, and several computational methods have been recently developed to predict the protein-rna interactions of rna-binding proteins. newly developed discriminative descriptors will help to improve the prediction accuracy of these prediction methods and provide further meaningful information for researchers.


RESULTS
in this work, we designed two structural features  and according to the statistical and structural analysis of protein-rna complexes, the two features were powerful for identifying rna-binding protein residues. using these two features and other excellent structure- and sequence-based features, a random forest classifier was constructed to predict rna-binding residues. the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve  of five-fold cross-validation for our method on training set rbp <dig> was  <dig> , and when applied to the test set rbp <dig>  the prediction accuracy  was  <dig> , and the f-score was  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
the good prediction performance of our method revealed that the two newly designed descriptors could be discriminative for inferring protein residues interacting with rnas. to facilitate the use of our method, a web-server called rnaprosite, which implements the proposed method, was constructed and is freely available at http://lilab.ecust.edu.cn/nabind.
