BACKGROUND
an appropriate choice of the modeling formalism from the broad range of existing ones may be crucial for efficiently describing and analyzing biological systems.


RESULTS
we propose a new unifying and incremental formalism for the representation and modeling of biological interaction networks. this formalism allows automated translations into other formalisms, thus enabling a thorough study of the dynamic properties of a biological system. as a first illustration, we propose a translation into the r. thomas' multivalued logical formalism which provides a possible semantics; a methodology for constructing such models is presented on a classical benchmark: the Î» phage genetic switch. we also show how to extract from our model a classical ode description of the dynamics of a system.


CONCLUSIONS
this approach provides an additional level of description between the biological and mathematical ones. it yields, on the one hand, a knowledge expression in a form which is intuitive for biologists and, on the other hand, its representation in a formal and structured way.
