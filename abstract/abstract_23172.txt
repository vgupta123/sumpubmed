BACKGROUND
this study characterises the molecular processes altered by both elevated co <dig> and increasing temperature in oysters. differences in resilience of marine organisms against the environmental stressors associated with climate change will have significant implications for the sustainability of coastal ecosystems worldwide. some evidence suggests that climate change resilience can differ between populations within a species. b <dig> oysters represent a unique genetic resource because of their capacity to better withstand the impacts of elevated co <dig> at the physiological level, compared to non-selected oysters from the same species . here, we used proteomic and transcriptomic analysis of gill tissue to evaluate whether the differential response of b <dig> oysters to elevated co <dig> also extends to increased temperature.


RESULTS
substantial and distinctive effects on protein concentrations and gene expression were evident among b <dig> oysters responding to elevated co <dig> or elevated temperature. the combination of both stressors also altered oyster gill proteomes and gene expression. however, the impacts of elevated co <dig> and temperature were not additive or synergistic, and may be antagonistic.


CONCLUSIONS
the data suggest that the simultaneous exposure of co2-resilient oysters to near-future projected ocean ph and temperature results in complex changes in molecular processes in order to prevent stress-induced cellular damage. the differential response of b <dig> oysters to the combined stressors also indicates that the addition of thermal stress may impair the resilience of these oysters to decreased ph. overall, this study reveals the intracellular mechanisms that might enable marine calcifiers to endure the emergent, adverse seawater conditions resulting from climate change.
