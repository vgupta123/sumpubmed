BACKGROUND
cattail  has been spreading in phosphorus  enriched areas of the oligotrophic florida everglades at the expense of sawgrass . abundant evidence in the literature explains how the opportunistic features of typha might lead to a complete dominance in p-enriched areas. less clear is how typha can grow and acquire p at extremely low p levels, which prevail in the unimpacted areas of the everglades.


RESULTS
apparent p uptake kinetics were measured for intact plants of cladium and typha acclimated to low and high p at two levels of oxygen in hydroponic culture. the saturated rate of p uptake was higher in typha than in cladium and higher in low-p acclimated plants than in high-p acclimated plants. the affinity for p uptake was two-fold higher in typha than in cladium, and two- to three-fold higher for low-p acclimated plants compared to high-p acclimated plants. as cladium had a greater proportion of its biomass allocated to roots, the overall uptake capacity of the two species at high p did not differ. at low p availability, typha increased biomass allocation to roots more than cladium. both species also adjusted their p uptake kinetics, but typha more so than cladium. the adjustment of the p uptake system and increased biomass allocation to roots resulted in a five-fold higher uptake per plant for cladium and a ten-fold higher uptake for typha.


CONCLUSIONS
both cladium and typha adjust p uptake kinetics in relation to plant demand when p availability is high. when p concentrations are low, however, typha adjusts p uptake kinetics and also increases allocation to roots more so than cladium, thereby improving both efficiency and capacity of p uptake. cladium has less need to adjust p uptake kinetics because it is already efficient at acquiring p from peat soils . thus, although cladium and typha have qualitatively similar strategies to improve p-uptake efficiency and capacity under low p-conditions, typha shows a quantitatively greater response, possibly due to a lesser expression of these mechanisms than cladium. this difference between the two species helps to explain why an opportunistic species such as typha is able to grow side by side with cladium in the p-deficient everglades.
