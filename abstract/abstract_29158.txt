BACKGROUND
a set of  <dig> e. coli strains of human fecal origin isolated in the south moravia region of the czech republic was collected during the years 2007– <dig>  altogether,  <dig> virulence determinants and  <dig> bacteriocin-encoding genes were tested in each of them.


RESULTS
the occurrence of bacteriocin-encoding genes was found to be positively correlated with the occurrence of e. coli virulence factors. based on the presence of virulence factors and their combinations, e. coli strains were classified as non-pathogenic e. coli , diarrhea-associated e. coli  and expec strains . non-pathogenic and diarrhea-associated e. coli strains had a low frequency of bacteriocinogeny . expec strains encoding s-fimbriae , p-fimbriae  and having genes for aerobactin biosynthesis , α-hemolysis  and cytotoxic necrosis factor  were often bacteriocinogenic , had a high prevalence of bacteriocin multi-producers and showed a higher frequency of genes encoding microcins h <dig>  m, v, b <dig> and colicins e <dig>  ia and s <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the occurrence of bacteriocin-encoding genes and expec virulence determinants correlate positively in e. coli strains of human fecal origin. bacteriocin synthesis appears to modulate the ability of e. coli strains to reside in the human intestine and/or the virulence of the corresponding strains.
