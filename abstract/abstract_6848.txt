BACKGROUND
the african buffalo  is an important role player in the savannah ecosystem. it has become a species of relevance because of its role as a wildlife maintenance host for an array of infectious and zoonotic diseases some of which include corridor disease, foot-and-mouth disease and bovine tuberculosis. to date, no complete genome sequence for s. caffer had been available for study and the genomes of other species such as the domestic cow  had been used as a proxy for any genetics analysis conducted on this species. here, the high coverage genome sequence of the african buffalo  is presented.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  genes were predicted and  <dig>  genes could be successfully annotated to s. caffer while  <dig> genes remained unannotated. moreover, in order to extend a detailed annotation of s. caffer, gene clusters were constructed using twelve additional mammalian genomes. the s. caffer genome contains  <dig>  gene clusters, of which  <dig> are shared exclusively between b. taurus and s. caffer.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a unique genomic perspective for the s. caffer, allowing for the identification of novel variants that may play a role in the natural history and physiological adaptations.
