BACKGROUND
physical mapping of transgenic insertions by fluorescence in situ hybridization  is a reliable and cost-effective technique. chromosomal assignment is commonly achieved either by concurrent g-banding or by a multi-color fish approach consisting of iteratively co-hybridizing the transgenic sequence of interest with one or more chromosome-specific probes at a time, until the location of the transgenic insertion is identified.


RESULTS
here we report a technical development for fast chromosomal assignment of transgenic insertions at the single cell level in mouse and rat models. this comprises a simplified 'single denaturation mixed hybridization' procedure that combines multi-color karyotyping by multiplex fish , for simultaneous and unambiguous identification of all chromosomes at once, and the use of a quantum dot  conjugate for the transgene detection.


CONCLUSIONS
although the exploitation of the unique optical properties of qd nanocrystals, such as photo-stability and brightness, to improve fish performance generally has been previously investigated, to our knowledge this is the first report of a purpose-designed molecular cytogenetic protocol in which the combined use of qds and standard organic fluorophores is specifically tailored to assist gene transfer technology.
