BACKGROUND
dipyrone  is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug commonly used both in human and in veterinary medicine. after oral administration, is broken down rapidly to metabolites which largely retain the activity of the parent drug. its metabolites have analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects.


RESULTS
the subjects were eight healthy male large white post-suckling piglets, weighing between  <dig>  to  <dig>  kg, of ages 35 ± 10 days. the animals were administered met  by an intramuscular  injection. the study calculated the value of several hemorheological parameters. significant impact of met treatment  was proven in case: activated partial thromboplastin time; ratio of activated partial thromboplastin time; hemoglobin; hematocrit; mean corpuscular hemoglobin; mean corpuscular volume; red blood cells volume; white blood cells volume; prothrombin time index.


CONCLUSIONS
in summation, our observations suggest that a piglet model is useful for studying the impact of met on hemorheological parameters.
