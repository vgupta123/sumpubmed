BACKGROUND
heterotrimeric g-proteins relay extracellular signals to intracellular effector proteins. multiple methods have been developed to monitor their activity; including labeled nucleotides and biosensors based on genetically engineered g-proteins. here we describe a method for monitoring unlabeled nucleotide binding to endogenous g-proteins α-subunits in a homogeneous assay based on the interaction of 4′,5′-bis-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein  with g-protein α-subunits.


RESULTS
the biarsenic fluorescent ligand f2flash binds to various wild-type g-protein α-subunits  via high affinity as-cysteine interactions. this allosteric label enables real time monitoring of the nucleotide bound states of α-subunits via changes in fluorescence anisotropy and intensity of their f2flash-complexes. we have found that different α-subunits displayed different signal amplitudes when interacting with f2flash, being more sensitive to nucleotide binding to αi, αs, αolf and αq than to α <dig>  addition of nucleotides to f2flash-labeled α-subunits caused concentration-dependent effects on their fluorescence anisotropy. pec <dig> values of studied nucleotides depended on the subtype of the α-subunit and were from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for gtpγs, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for gppnhp and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for gdp and lastly up to  <dig>  for gmp. while gdp and gmp increased the fluorescence anisotropy of f2flash complexes with αi-subunits, they had the opposite effect on the other αβγm complexes studied.


CONCLUSIONS
biarsenical ligands interact allosterically with endogenous g-protein α-subunits in a nucleotide-sensitive manner, so the presence or absence of guanine nucleotides has an effect on the fluorescence anisotropy, intensity and lifetime of f2flash-g-protein complexes.
