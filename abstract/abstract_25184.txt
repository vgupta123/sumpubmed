BACKGROUND
the investigation of complex disease heterogeneity has been challenging. here, we introduce a network-based approach, using partial correlations, that analyzes the relationships among multiple disease-related phenotypes.


RESULTS
we applied this method to two large, well-characterized studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . we also examined the associations between these copd phenotypic networks and other factors, including case-control status, disease severity, and genetic variants. using these phenotypic networks, we have detected novel relationships between phenotypes that would not have been observed using traditional epidemiological approaches.


CONCLUSIONS
phenotypic network analysis of complex diseases could provide novel insights into disease susceptibility, disease severity, and genetic mechanisms.
