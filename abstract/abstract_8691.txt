BACKGROUND
left hemispheric dominance of language processing and handedness, previously thought to be unique to humans, is currently under debate. to gain an insight into the origin of lateralization in primates, we have studied gray mouse lemurs, suggested to represent the most ancestral primate condition. we explored potential functional asymmetries on the behavioral level by applying a combined handedness and auditory perception task. for testing handedness, we used a forced food-grasping task. for testing auditory perception, we adapted the head turn paradigm, originally established for exploring hemispheric specializations in conspecific sound processing in old world monkeys, and exposed  <dig> subjects to control sounds and conspecific communication sounds of positive and negative emotional valence.


RESULTS
the tested mouse lemur population did not show an asymmetry in hand preference or in orientation towards conspecific communication sounds. however, males, but not females, exhibited a significant right ear-left hemisphere bias when exposed to conspecific communication sounds of negative emotional valence. orientation asymmetries were not related to hand preference.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide the first evidence for sex-specific asymmetries for conspecific communication sound perception in non-human primates. furthermore, they suggest that hemispheric dominance for communication sound processing evolved before handedness and independently from each other.
