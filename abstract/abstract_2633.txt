BACKGROUND
streptococcus suis is divided into  <dig> serotypes based on a serological reaction against the capsular polysaccharide . multiplex pcr tests targeting the cps locus are also used to determine s. suis serotypes, but they cannot differentiate between serotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  and between serotypes  <dig> and 1/ <dig>  here, we developed a pipeline permitting in silico serotype determination from whole-genome sequencing  short-read data that can readily identify all 29 s. suis serotypes.


RESULTS
we sequenced the genomes of  <dig> strains representing all  <dig> known s. suis serotypes. we next combined available software into an automated pipeline permitting in silico serotyping of strains by differential alignment of short-read sequencing data to a custom s. suis cps loci database. strains of serotype pairs  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> and 1/ <dig> could be differentiated by a missense mutation in the cpsk gene. we report a 99 % match between coagglutination- and pipeline-determined serotypes for strains in our collection. we used  <dig> additional s. suis genomes downloaded from the ncbi’s sequence read archive  to validate the pipeline. validation with sra wgs data resulted in a 92 % match. included pipeline subroutines permitted us to assess strain virulence marker content and obtain multilocus sequence typing directly from wgs data.


CONCLUSIONS
our pipeline permits rapid and accurate determination of s. suis serotype, and other lineage information, directly from wgs data. by discriminating between serotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  and between serotypes  <dig> and 1/ <dig>  our approach solves a three-decade longstanding s. suis typing issue.
