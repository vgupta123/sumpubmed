BACKGROUND
enteric redmouth  disease also known as yersiniosis is a contagious disease affecting salmonids, mainly rainbow trout. the causative agent is the gram-negative bacterium yersinia ruckeri. the disease can be diagnosed by isolation and identification of the causative agent, or detection of the pathogen using fluorescent antibody tests, elisa and pcr assays. these diagnostic methods are laborious, time consuming and need well trained personnel.


RESULTS
a loop-mediated isothermal amplification  assay was developed and evaluated for detection of y. ruckeri the etiological agent of enteric red mouth  disease in salmonids. the assay was optimised to amplify the yrui/yrur gene, which encodes y. ruckeri quorum sensing system, in the presence of a specific primer set and bst dna polymerase at an isothermal temperature of 63Â°c for one hour. amplification products were detected by visual inspection, agarose gel electrophoresis and by real-time monitoring of turbidity resulted by formation of lamp amplicons. digestion with hphi restriction enzyme demonstrated that the amplified product was unique. the specificity of the assay was verified by the absence of amplification products when tested against related bacteria. the assay had 10-fold higher sensitivity compared with conventional pcr and successfully detected y. ruckeri not only in pure bacterial culture but also in tissue homogenates of infected fish.


CONCLUSIONS
the erm-lamp assay represents a practical alternative to the microbiological approach for rapid, sensitive and specific detection of y. ruckeri in fish farms. the assay is carried out in one hour and needs only a heating block or water bath as laboratory furniture. the advantages of the erm-lamp assay make it a promising tool for molecular detection of enteric red mouth disease in fish farms.
