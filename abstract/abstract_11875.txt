BACKGROUND
high throughput screens with rna interference technology enable loss-of-function analyses of gene activities in mammalian cells. while the construction of genome-scale shrna libraries has been successful, results of large-scale screening of those libraries can be difficult to analyze because of the relatively high noise levels and the fact that not all shrnas in a library are equally effective in silencing gene expression.


RESULTS
we have screened a library consisting of  <dig>  shrnas directed against  <dig>  human genes for functions that are necessary in cell detachment induced by a constitutively activated c-abl tyrosine kinase. to deal with the issues of noise and uncertainty of knockdown efficiencies, we employed an analytical strategy that combines quantitative data analysis with biological knowledge, i.e. gene ontology and pathway information, to increase the power of the rnai screening technique. using this strategy we found  <dig> candidate genes to be involved in abl-induced disruption of cell adhesion, and verified that the knockdown of il6st is associated with enhanced cell attachment.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that the power of genome-wide quantitative shrna screens can be significantly increased when analyzed using a systems biology-based approach to identify functional gene networks.
