BACKGROUND
many neuromuscular blockers act as negative allosteric modulators of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors by decreasing affinity and potency of acetylcholine. the neuromuscular blocker rapacuronium has been shown to have facilitatory effects at muscarinic receptors leading to bronchospasm. we examined the influence of rapacuronium on acetylcholine  binding to and activation of individual subtypes of muscarinic receptors expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells to determine its receptor selectivity.


RESULTS
at equilibrium rapacuronium bound to all subtypes of muscarinic receptors with micromolar affinity  and displayed negative cooperativity with both high- and low-affinity ach binding states. rapacuronium accelerated ach association with and dissociation from odd-numbered receptor subtypes. with respect to gtpγs binding rapacuronium alone behaved as an inverse agonist at all subtypes. rapacuronium concentration-dependently decreased the potency of ach-induced gtpγs binding at m <dig> and m <dig> receptors. in contrast,  <dig>  μm rapacuronium significantly increased ach potency at m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> receptors. kinetic measurements at m <dig> receptors showed acceleration of the rate of ach-induced gtpγs binding by rapacuronium.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate a novel dichotomy in rapacuronium effects at odd-numbered muscarinic receptors. rapacuronium accelerates the rate of ach binding but decreases its affinity under equilibrium conditions. this results in potentiation of receptor activation at low concentrations of rapacuronium  but not at high concentrations . these observations highlight the relevance and necessity of performing physiological tests under non-equilibrium conditions in evaluating the functional effects of allosteric modulators at muscarinic receptors. they also provide molecular basis for potentiating m <dig> receptor-mediated bronchoconstriction.
