BACKGROUND
dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids , in particular the long chain marine fatty acids docosahexaenoic  and eicosapentaenoic , are linked to many health benefits in humans and in animal models. little is known of the molecular response to dha and epa of the small intestine, and the potential contribution of this organ to the beneficial effects of these fatty acids. here, we assessed gene expression changes induced by dha and epa in the wildtype c57bl/6j murine small intestine using whole genome microarrays and functionally characterized the most prominent biological process.


RESULTS
the main biological process affected based on gene expression analysis was lipid metabolism. fatty acid uptake, peroxisomal and mitochondrial beta-oxidation, and omega-oxidation of fatty acids were all increased. quantitative real time pcr, and -in a second animal experiment- intestinal fatty acid oxidation measurements confirmed significant gene expression differences and showed in a dose-dependent manner significant changes at biological functional level. furthermore, no major changes in the expression of lipid metabolism genes were observed in the colon.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that marine n- <dig> fatty acids regulate small intestinal gene expression and increase fatty acid oxidation. since this organ contributes significantly to whole organism energy use, this effect on the small intestine may well contribute to the beneficial physiological effects of marine pufas under conditions that will normally lead to development of obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes.
