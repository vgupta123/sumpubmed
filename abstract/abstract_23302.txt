BACKGROUND
kutzneria is a representative of a rarely observed genus of the family pseudonocardiaceae. kutzneria species were initially placed in the streptosporangiaceae genus and later reconsidered to be an independent genus of the pseudonocardiaceae. kutzneria albida is one of the eight known members of the genus. this strain is a unique producer of the glycosylated polyole macrolide aculeximycin which is active against both bacteria and fungi. kutzneria albida genome sequencing and analysis allow a deeper understanding of evolution of this genus of pseudonocardiaceae, provide new insight in the phylogeny of the genus, as well as decipher the hidden secondary metabolic potential of these rare actinobacteria.


RESULTS
to explore the biosynthetic potential of kutzneria albida to its full extent, the complete genome was sequenced. with a size of  <dig> ,926 bp, coding for  <dig>  genes, it stands alongside other pseudonocardiaceae with large circular genomes. genome analysis revealed  <dig> gene clusters potentially encoding secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways. two large genomic islands were identified, containing regions most enriched with secondary metabolism gene clusters. large parts of this secondary metabolism “clustome” are dedicated to siderophores production.


CONCLUSIONS
kutzneria albida is the first species of the genus kutzneria with a completely sequenced genome. genome sequencing allowed identifying the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of aculeximycin, one of the largest known oligosaccharide-macrolide antibiotics. moreover, the genome revealed  <dig> additional putative secondary metabolite gene clusters, suggesting a huge biosynthetic potential, which makes kutzneria albida a very rich source of natural products. comparison of the kutzneria albida genome to genomes of other actinobacteria clearly shows its close relations with pseudonocardiaceae in line with the taxonomic position of the genus.
