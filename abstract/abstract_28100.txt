BACKGROUND
sugarcane mosaic virus  disease causes substantial losses of grain yield and forage biomass in susceptible maize cultivars. maize resistance to scmv is associated with two dominant genes, scmv <dig> and scmv <dig>  which are located on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> and near the centromere region of chromosome  <dig>  respectively. we combined both linkage and association mapping to identify positional candidate genes for scmv <dig> 


RESULTS
scmv <dig> was fine-mapped in a segregating population derived from near-isogenic lines and further validated and fine-mapped using two recombinant inbred line populations. the combined results assigned the scmv <dig> locus to a  <dig> -kb interval, and candidate genes within this region were predicted based on the publicly available b <dig> sequence. none of three predicted genes that are possibly involved in the disease resistance response are similar to receptor-like resistance genes. candidate geneâ€“based association mapping was conducted using a panel of  <dig> inbred lines with variable resistance to scmv. a presence/absence variation  in the scmv <dig> region and two polymorphic sites around the zmtrx-h gene were significantly associated with scmv resistance.


CONCLUSIONS
combined linkage and association mapping pinpoints zmtrx-h as the most likely positional candidate gene for scmv <dig>  these results pave the way towards cloning of scmv <dig> and facilitate marker-assisted selection for potyvirus resistance in maize.
