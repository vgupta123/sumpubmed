BACKGROUND
precise quantitative growth measurements and detection of small growth changes in high-throughput manner is essential for fundamental studies of bacterial cell. however, an inherent tradeoff for measurement quality in high-throughput methods sacrifices some measurement quality. a key challenge has been how to enhance measurement quality without sacrificing throughput.


RESULTS
we developed a new high-throughput measurement system, termed colony-live. here we show that colony-live provides accurate measurement of three growth values , maximum growth rate , and saturation point growth ) by visualizing colony growth over time. by using a new normalization method for colony growth, colony-live gives more precise and accurate growth values than the conventional method. we demonstrated the utility of colony-live by measuring growth values for the entire keio collection of escherichia coli single-gene knockout mutants. by using colony-live, we were able to identify subtle growth defects of single-gene knockout mutants that were undetectable by the conventional method quantified by fixed time-point camera imaging. further, colony-live can reveal genes that influence the length of the lag-phase and the saturation point of growth.


CONCLUSIONS
measurement quality is critical to achieving the resolution required to identify unique phenotypes among a diverse range of phenotypes. sharing high-quality genome-wide datasets should benefit many researchers who are interested in specific gene functions or the architecture of cellular systems. our colony-live system provides a new powerful tool to accelerate accumulation of knowledge of microbial growth phenotypes.
