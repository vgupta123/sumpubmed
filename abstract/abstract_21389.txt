BACKGROUND
many gene-set analysis methods have been previously proposed and compared through simulation studies and analysis of real datasets for binary phenotypes. we focused on the survival phenotype and compared the performances of gene set enrichment analysis , global test , wald-type test  and global boost test  methods in a simulation study and on two ovarian cancer data sets. we considered two versions of gsea by allowing different weights: gsea <dig> uses equal weights, yielding results similar to the kolmogorov-smirnov test; while gsea2's weights are based on the correlation between genes and the phenotype.


RESULTS
we compared gsea <dig>  gsea <dig>  gt, wt and gbst in a simulation study with various settings for the correlation structure of the genes and the association parameter between the survival outcome and the genes. simulation results indicated that gt, wt and gbst consistently have higher power than gsea <dig> and gsea <dig> across all scenarios. however, the power of the five tests depends on the combination of correlation structure and association parameter. for the ovarian cancer data set, using the fdr threshold of q <  <dig> , the gt, wt and gbst detected  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> significant pathways, respectively, whereas neither gsea <dig> nor gsea <dig> detected any significant pathways. in addition, among the pathways found significant by gt, wt, and gbst, three pathways - purine metabolism, leukocyte transendothelial migration and jak-stat signaling pathway - overlapped with those reported in previous ovarian cancer microarray studies.


CONCLUSIONS
simulation studies and a real data example indicate that gt, wt and gbst tend to have high power, whereas gsea <dig> and gsea <dig> have lower power. we also found that the power of the five tests is much higher when genes are correlated than when genes are independent, when survival is positively associated with genes. it seems that there is a synergistic effect in detecting significant gene sets when significant genes have within-class correlation and the association between survival and genes is positive or negative .
