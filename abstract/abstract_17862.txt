BACKGROUND
oysters are morphologically plastic and hence difficult subjects for taxonomic and evolutionary studies. it is long been suspected, based on the extraordinary species diversity observed, that asia pacific is the epicenter of oyster speciation. to understand the species diversity and its evolutionary history, we collected five crassostrea species from asia and sequenced their complete mitochondrial  genomes in addition to two newly released asian oysters  for a comprehensive analysis.


RESULTS
the six asian crassostrea mt genomes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp in size, and all coded for  <dig> genes  on the same strand. their genomes contained a split of the rrnl gene and duplication of trnm, trnk and trnq genes. they shared the same gene order that differed from an atlantic sister species by as many as nine trna changes  and even differed significantly from s. mordax in protein-coding genes. phylogenetic analysis indicates that the six asian crassostrea species emerged between  <dig> and  <dig> myr ago, while the atlantic species evolved  <dig> myr ago.


CONCLUSIONS
the complete conservation of gene order in the six asian crassostrea species over  <dig> myr is highly unusual given the remarkable rate of rearrangements in their sister species and other bivalves. it provides strong evidence for the recent speciation of the six crassostrea species in asia. it further indicates that changes in mt gene order may not be strictly a function of time but subject to other constraints that are presently not well understood.
