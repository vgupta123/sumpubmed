BACKGROUND
sharing a common erbb/her receptor signaling pathway, heregulin  induces differentiation of mcf- <dig> human breast cancer cells while epidermal growth factor  elicits proliferation. although cell fates resulting from action of the aforementioned ligands completely different, the respective gene expression profiles in early transcription are qualitatively similar, suggesting that gene expression during late transcription, but not early transcription, may reflect ligand specificity. in this study, based on both the data from time-course quantitative real-time pcr on over  <dig>  human transcription factors and microarray of all human genes, we identified a series of transcription factors which may control hrg-specific late transcription in mcf- <dig> cells.


RESULTS
we predicted that four transcription factors including egr <dig>  fra- <dig>  fhl <dig>  and dipa should have responsibility of regulation in mcf- <dig> cell differentiation. validation analysis suggested that one member of the activator protein  <dig>  family, fosl- <dig> , appeared immediately following c-fos expression, might be responsible for expression of transcription factor fhl <dig> through activation of the ap- <dig> complex. furthermore, rnai gene silencing of fosl- <dig> and fhl <dig> resulted in increase of extracellular signal-regulated kinase  phosphorylation of which duration was sustained by hrg stimulation.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis indicated that a time-dependent transcriptional regulatory network including c-fos, fra- <dig>  and fhl <dig> is vital in controlling the erk signaling pathway through a negative feedback loop for mcf- <dig> cell differentiation.
