BACKGROUND
cardiomyocyte contraction is initiated by influx of extracellular calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels. these oligomeric channels utilize auxiliary β subunits to chaperone the pore-forming α subunit to the plasma membrane, and to modulate channel electrophysiology  <cit> . several β subunit family members are detected by rt-pcr in the embryonic heart. null mutations in mouse β <dig>  but not in the other three β family members, are embryonic lethal at e <dig>  due to defects in cardiac contractility  <cit> . however, a drawback of the mouse model is that embryonic heart rhythm is difficult to study in live embryos due to their intra-uterine development. moreover, phenotypes may be obscured by secondary effects of hypoxia. as a first step towards developing a model for contributions of β subunits to the onset of embryonic heart rhythm, we characterized the structure and expression of β <dig> subunits in zebrafish and other teleosts.


RESULTS
cloning of two zebrafish β <dig> subunit genes  indicated they are membrane-associated guanylate kinase -family genes. zebrafish β <dig> genes show high conservation with mammals within the sh <dig> and guanylate kinase domains that comprise the "core" of maguk proteins, but β <dig>  is much more divergent in sequence than β <dig> . alternative splicing occurs at the n-terminus and within the internal hook domain. in both β <dig> genes, alternative short atg-containing first exons are separated by some of the largest introns in the genome, suggesting that individual transcript variants could be subject to independent cis-regulatory control. in the tetraodon nigrovidis and fugu rubripes genomes, we identified single β <dig> subunit gene loci. comparative analysis of the teleost and human β <dig> loci indicates that the short 5' exon sequences are highly conserved. a subset of 5' exons appear to be unique to teleost genomes, while others are shared with mammals. alternative splicing is temporally and spatially regulated in embryo and adult. moreover, a different subset of spliced β <dig> transcript variants is detected in the embryonic heart compared to the adult.


CONCLUSIONS
these studies refine our understanding of β <dig> subunit diversity arising from alternative splicing, and provide the groundwork for functional analysis of β <dig> subunit diversity in the embryonic heart.
