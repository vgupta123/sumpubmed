BACKGROUND
there is an increasing demand to assemble and align large-scale biological sequence data sets. the commonly used multiple sequence alignment programs are still limited in their ability to handle very large amounts of sequences because the system lacks a scalable high-performance computing  environment with a greatly extended data storage capacity.


RESULTS
we designed clustalxeed, a software system for multiple sequence alignment with incremental improvements over previous versions of the clustalx and clustalw-mpi software. the primary advantage of clustalxeed over other multiple sequence alignment software is its ability to align a large family of protein or nucleic acid sequences. to solve the conventional memory-dependency problem, clustalxeed uses both physical random access memory  and a distributed file-allocation system for distance matrix construction and pair-align computation. the computation efficiency of disk-storage system was markedly improved by implementing an efficient load-balancing algorithm, called "idle node-seeking task algorithm" . the new editing option and the graphical user interface  provide ready access to a parallel-computing environment for users who seek fast and easy alignment of large dna and protein sequence sets.


CONCLUSIONS
clustalxeed can now compute a large volume of biological sequence data sets, which were not tractable in any other parallel or single msa program. the main developments include: 1) the ability to tackle larger sequence alignment problems than possible with previous systems through markedly improved storage-handling capabilities. 2) implementing an efficient task load-balancing algorithm, insta, which improves overall processing times for multiple sequence alignment with input sequences of non-uniform length. 3) support for both single pc and distributed cluster systems.
