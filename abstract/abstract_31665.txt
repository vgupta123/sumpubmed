BACKGROUND
the importance of voltage-dependent conductances in sensory information processing is well-established in insect photoreceptors. here we present the characterization of electrical properties in photoreceptors of the cockroach , a nocturnal insect with a visual system adapted for dim light.


RESULTS
whole-cell patch-clamped photoreceptors had high capacitances and input resistances, indicating large photosensitive rhabdomeres suitable for efficient photon capture and amplification of small photocurrents at low light levels. two voltage-dependent potassium conductances were found in the photoreceptors: a delayed rectifier type  and a fast transient inactivating type . activation of kdr occurred during physiological voltage responses induced by light stimulation, whereas ka was nearly fully inactivated already at the dark resting potential. in addition, hyperpolarization of photoreceptors activated a small-amplitude inward-rectifying  current mediated at least partially by chloride. computer simulations showed that kdr shapes light responses by opposing the light-induced depolarization and speeding up the membrane time constant, whereas ka and ir have a negligible role in the majority of cells. however, larger ka conductances were found in smaller and rapidly adapting photoreceptors, where ka could have a functional role.


CONCLUSIONS
the relative expression of ka and kdr in cockroach photoreceptors was opposite to the previously hypothesized framework for dark-active insects, necessitating further comparative work on the conductances. in general, the varying deployment of stereotypical k+ conductances in insect photoreceptors highlights their functional flexibility in neural coding.
