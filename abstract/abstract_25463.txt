BACKGROUND
infectious keratoconjunctivitis  is a clinical condition affecting eyes of domestic and wild caprinae worldwide, and mycoplasma conjunctivae is considered the primary causative agent of ikc in sheep, goats and wild caprinae. domestic ruminants from high mountain habitats share grazing areas with wild mountain ungulates, such as chamois , alpine ibex  and european mouflon , and domestic sheep seem to act as m. conjunctivae reservoir. in this study, the presence of m. conjunctivae in domestic sheep and goats from the two main mountain ranges of northern spain, the pyrenees and the cantabrian mountains, has been investigated.


RESULTS
eye swabs were obtained from  <dig> domestic small ruminants selected from flocks that seasonally graze in alpine meadows during three consecutive years . seventy-nine out of the  <dig> domestic sheep  tested positive to a m. conjunctivae specific real time-pcr  in at least one eye, whereas all the  <dig> sampled domestic goats were negative. statistically significant higher prevalence and higher proportion of infected flocks  was observed in the pyrenees , where m. conjunctivae is widespread and probably endemic in domestic sheep, than in the cantabrian mountains . twenty-five sheep  which showed clinical signs consistent with infectious keratoconjunctivitis  were negative by rt-pcr. in contrast,  <dig> out of the  <dig>  m. conjunctivae-positive sheep from the pyrenees and the eight positive sheep from the cantabrian mountains were asymptomatic.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides rt-pcr-based evidences of m. conjunctivae maintenance in domestic sheep, as well as a relationship between prevalence in domestic sheep and previously reported m. conjunctivae and ikc in wild ruminants. domestic goats do not seem to play an important role in the epidemiology of m. conjunctivae in alpine habitats from northern spain.
