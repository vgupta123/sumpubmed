BACKGROUND
the use of auxin-producing rhizosphere bacteria as agricultural products promises increased root production and therefore greater phosphate  uptake. whilst such bacteria promote root production in vitro, the nature of the bacteria-plant interaction in live soil, particularly concerning any effects on nutrient uptake, are not known. this study uses bacillus amyloliquefaciens fzb <dig>  an auxin-producing rhizobacterium, as a dressing on triticum aestivum seeds. it then examines the effects on root production, pi uptake, pi-related gene expression and organic carbon  exudation.


RESULTS
seed treatment with b. amyloliquefaciens fzb <dig> increased root production at low environmental pi concentrations, but significantly repressed root pi uptake. this coincided with an auxin-mediated reduction in expression of the pi transporters tapht <dig>  and tapht <dig> . applied exogenous auxin also triggered an increase in root c exudation. at high external pi concentrations, root production was promoted by b. amyloliquefaciens fzb <dig>  but pi uptake was unaffected.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that, alongside promoting root production, auxin biosynthesis by b. amyloliquefaciens fzb <dig> both re-models pi transporter expression and elevates organic c exudation. this shows the potential importance of rhizobacterial-derived auxin following colonisation of root surfaces, and the nature of this bacteria-plant interaction in soil.
