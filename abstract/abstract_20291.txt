BACKGROUND
crispr genome-editing technology makes it possible to quickly and cheaply delete non-protein-coding regulatory elements. we present a vector system adapted for this purpose called decko , which applies a simple two-step cloning to generate lentiviral vectors expressing two guide rnas  simultaneously. the key feature of decko is its use of a single 165 bp starting oligonucleotide carrying the variable sequences of both grnas, making it fully scalable from single-locus studies to complex library cloning.


RESULTS
we apply decko to deleting the promoters of one protein-coding gene and two oncogenic lncrnas, uca <dig> and the highly-expressed malat <dig>  focus of many previous studies employing rna interference approaches. decko successfully deleted genomic fragments ranging in size from  <dig> to 3000 bp in four human cell lines. using a clone-derivation workflow lasting approximately 20 days, we obtained  <dig> homozygous and  <dig> heterozygous promoter knockouts in three human cell lines. frequent target region inversions were observed. these clones have reductions in steady-state malat <dig> rna levels of up to 98 % and display reduced proliferation rates.


CONCLUSIONS
we present a dual crispr tool, decko, which is cloned using a single starting oligonucleotide, thereby affording simplicity and scalability to crispr knockout studies of non-coding genomic elements, including long non-coding rnas.
