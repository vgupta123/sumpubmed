BACKGROUND
litter size and piglet mortality are important traits in pig production. the study aimed to identify quantitative trait loci  for litter size and mortality traits, including total number of piglets born , litter size at day  <dig>  and mortality rate before day  <dig>  in danish landrace and yorkshire pigs by genome-wide association studies .

methods
the phenotypic records and genotypes were available in  <dig>  landrace pigs and  <dig>  yorkshire pigs born from  <dig> to  <dig>  a linear mixed model  with a single snp regression and a bayesian mixture model  including effects of all snps simultaneously were used for gwas to detect significant qtl association. the response variable used in the gwas was corrected phenotypic value which was obtained by adjusting original observations for non-genetic effects. for bm, the qtl region was determined by using a novel post-gibbs analysis based on the posterior mixture probability.


RESULTS
the detected association patterns from lm and bm models were generally similar. however, bm gave more distinct detection signals than lm. the clearer peaks from bm indicated that the bm model has an advantage in respect of identifying and distinguishing regions of putative qtl. using bm and qtl region analysis, for the three traits and two breeds a total of  <dig> qtl regions were identified on ssc <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  among these qtl regions,  <dig> regions located on ssc <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were associated with more than one trait.


CONCLUSIONS
this study detected qtl regions associated with litter size and piglet mortality traits in danish pigs using a novel approach of post-gibbs analysis based on posterior mixture probability. all of the detected qtl regions overlapped with regions previously reported for reproduction traits. the regions commonly detected in different traits and breeds could be resources for multi-trait and across-bred selection. the proposed novel qtl region analysis method would be a good alternative to detect and define qtl regions.
