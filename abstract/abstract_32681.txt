BACKGROUND
in animals, micrornas  regulate the protein synthesis of their target messenger rnas  by either translational repression or deadenylation. mirnas are frequently found to be co-expressed in different tissues and cell types, while some form polycistronic clusters on genomes. interactions between targets of co-expressed mirnas  have not yet been systematically investigated.


RESULTS
here we integrated information from predicted and experimentally verified mirna targets to characterize protein complex networks regulated by human mirnas. we found striking evidence that individual mirnas or co-expressed mirnas frequently target several components of protein complexes. we experimentally verified that the mir-141-200c cluster targets different components of the ctbp/zeb complex, suggesting a potential orchestrated regulation in epithelial to mesenchymal transition.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate a coordinate posttranscriptional regulation of protein complexes by mirnas. these provide a sound basis for designing experiments to study mirna function at a systems level.
