BACKGROUND
magnetic resonance  imaging is the preferred diagnostic tool to evaluate internal disorders of many joints in humans; however, the usefulness of mr imaging in the context of osteoarthritis, and joint disease in general, has yet to be characterized in veterinary medicine. the objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of short-duration  <dig> tesla mr imaging for the evaluation of cranial and caudal cruciate ligament, meniscal and cartilage damage, as well as the degree of osteoarthritis, in dogs affected by non-traumatic, naturally-occurring cranial cruciate ligament rupture . diagnoses made from mr images were compared to those made during surgical exploration. twenty-one client-owned dogs were included in this study, and one experienced evaluator assessed all images.


RESULTS
all cranial cruciate ligaments were correctly identified as ruptured. with one exception, all caudal cruciate ligaments were correctly identified as intact. high sensitivities and specificities were obtained when diagnosing meniscal rupture. mr images revealed additional subclinical lesions in both the cranial and caudal cruciate ligaments and in the menisci. there was a “clear” statistical  agreement between the mr and the surgical findings for both cartilage damage and degree of osteoarthritis. however, the large 95% confidence intervals indicated that evaluation of cartilage damage and of degree of osteoarthritis is not clinically satisfactory.


CONCLUSIONS
the presence of cruciate ligament damage and meniscal tears could be accurately assessed using the mr images obtained with our protocol. however, in the case of meniscal evaluation, occasional misdiagnosis did occur. the presence of cartilage damage and the degree of osteoarthritis could not be properly evaluated.
