BACKGROUND
the hapmap project is a publicly available catalogue of common genetic variants that occur in humans, currently including several million snps across  <dig> individuals spanning  <dig> different populations. this important database does not provide any programmatic access to the dataset, furthermore no standard relational database interface is provided.


RESULTS
interpopula is a python api to access the hapmap dataset. interpopula provides integration facilities with both the python ecology of software  and other relevant human population datasets . a set of guidelines and code examples to address possible inconsistencies across heterogeneous data sources is also provided.


CONCLUSIONS
interpopula is a straightforward and flexible python api that facilitates the construction of scripts and applications that require access to the hapmap dataset.
