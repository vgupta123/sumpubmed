BACKGROUND
sh <dig> domains are small protein modules of 60– <dig> amino acids that bind to short proline-rich sequences with moderate-to-low affinity and specificity. interactions with sh <dig> domains play a crucial role in regulation of many cellular processes  and have thus been interesting targets in drug design. the decapeptide apsysppppp  binds with relatively high affinity to the sh <dig> domain of the abl tyrosine kinase , while it has a  <dig> times lower affinity for the α-spectrin sh <dig> domain .


RESULTS
here we present the high-resolution structure of the complex between the r21a mutant of spc-sh <dig> and p <dig> derived from nmr data. thermodynamic parameters of binding of p <dig> to both wt and r21a spc-sh <dig> were measured by a combination of isothermal titration and differential scanning calorimetry. mutation of arginine  <dig> to alanine in spc-sh <dig> increases 3- to 4-fold the binding affinity for p <dig> due to elimination at the binding-site interface of the steric clash produced by the longer arginine side chain. amide hydrogen-deuterium experiments on the free and p41-bound r21a spc-sh <dig> domain indicate that binding elicits a strong reduction in the conformational flexibility of the domain. despite the great differences in the thermodynamic magnitudes of binding, the structure of the r21a spc-sh3:p <dig> complex is remarkably similar to that of the abl-sh3:p <dig> complex, with only few differences in protein-ligand contacts at the specificity pocket. using empirical methods for the prediction of binding energetics based on solvent-accessible surface area calculations, the differences in experimental energetics of binding between the two complexes could not be properly explained only on the basis of the structural differences observed between the complexes. we suggest that the experimental differences in binding energetics can be at least partially ascribed to the absence in the r21a spc-sh3:p <dig> complex of several buried water molecules, which have been proposed previously to contribute largely to the highly negative enthalpy and entropy of binding in the abl-sh3:p <dig> complex.


CONCLUSIONS
based on a deep structural and thermodynamic analysis of a low and high affinity complex of two different sh <dig> domains with the same ligand p <dig>  we underline the importance of taking into account in any effective strategy of rational design of ligands, factors different from the direct protein-ligand interactions, such as the mediation of interactions by water molecules or the existence of cooperative conformational effects induced by binding.
