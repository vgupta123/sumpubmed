BACKGROUND
chicken red blood cells  are commonly used in hemagglutination inhibition  tests to measure hemagglutinating antibodies against influenza viruses. the use of horse rbcs in the hi test can reportedly increase its sensitivity when testing human sera for avian influenza antibodies. this study aims to compare the proportion of positives detected and the agreement between two hi tests using either chicken or horse red blood cells for antibody detection in sera of ducks experimentally infected or naturally exposed to indonesian h <dig> subtype avian influenza virus. in addition, comparison with a virus neutralisation  test was conducted with the experimental sera.


RESULTS
in the experimental study, the proportion of hi antibody-positive ducks increased slightly, from  <dig>  when using chicken rbcs to  <dig>  when using horse rbcs. the hi tests indicated almost perfect agreement  when results were dichotomised , and substantial agreement  for log titres. overall agreements between the two hi tests were greater than between either of the hi tests and the vn test. the use of horse rbcs also identified a higher proportion of antibody positives in field duck sera , with also almost perfect agreements for dichotomized results  =  <dig> ) and for log titres , respectively. factors that might explain observed differences in the proportion of antibody-positive ducks and in the agreements between hi tests are discussed.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we identified a good agreement between hi tests. however, when horse rbcs were used, a higher proportion of sera was positive  than using chicken rbcs, especially during the early response against h5n <dig> virus. the hrbc-hi might be more responsive in identifying early h5n <dig> hpai serological response and could be a recommended assay for avian influenza sero-surveillance in both wild and domestic birds.
