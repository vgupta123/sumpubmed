BACKGROUND
culture of mycobacterium tuberculosis is the gold standard method for the laboratory diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, after effective decontamination.


RESULTS
we evaluated squalamine and chlorhexidine to decontaminate sputum specimens for the culture of mycobacteria. eight sputum specimens were artificially infected with  <dig> colony-forming units /ml mycobacterium tuberculosis and staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans as contaminants. in the second step, we tested chlorhexidine-based decontamination on  <dig> clinical specimens, . in a last step, growth of contaminants and mycobacteria was measured in  <dig> consecutive sputum specimens using the routine nalc-naoh decontamination protocol or with  <dig>  % chlorhexidine decontamination and an inoculation on coletsos medium.

in the artificially model, contaminants grew in 100 % of the artificially infected sputum specimens decontaminated using 100 mg/ml squalamine, in  <dig>  % of specimens decontaminated using n-acetyl-l-cysteine-sodium hydroxide , and in 0 % of specimens decontaminated using  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, or 1 % chlorhexidine . these specimens yielded <102 cfu m. tuberculosis using nalc-naoh and >  <dig> .102 cfu m. tuberculosis when any concentration of chlorhexidine was used .

in the second step we found that  <dig>  %-chlorhexidine yielded 0 % contamination rate,  <dig>  % for  <dig>  %-chlorhexidine and  <dig>  % for  <dig>  %-chlorhexidine. as for the  <dig> specimens treated in parallel by both methods we found that when using the standard nalc-naoh decontamination method, 8/ <dig>  specimens yielded m. tuberculosis colonies with a time to detection of  <dig>  ± 3 days and an 8 % contamination rate. additionally,  <dig> specimens yielded mycobacteria colonies   , which has yielded a 100 % sensitivity for the chlorhexidine protocol. time to detection was of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days  and a 0 % contamination rate  using the  <dig>  %-chlorhexidine protocol.


CONCLUSIONS
in our work we showed for the first time that chlorhexidine based decontamination is superior to the standard nalc-naoh method in the isolation of m. tuberculosis from sputum specimens. we currently use  <dig>  %-chlorhexidine for the routine decontamination of sputum specimens for the isolation of m. tuberculosis and non-tuberculosis mycobacteria on egg-lecithin containing media.
