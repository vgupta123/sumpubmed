BACKGROUND
dose-dependent differential gene expression provides critical information required for regulatory decision-making. the lower costs associated with rna-seq have made it the preferred technology for transcriptomic analysis. however, concordance between rna-seq and microarray analyses in dose response studies has not been adequately vetted.


RESULTS
we compared the hepatic transcriptome of c57bl/ <dig> mice following gavage with sesame oil vehicle,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or 30 μg/kg tcdd every 4 days for 28 days using illumina hiseq rna-sequencing  and agilent 4× <dig> k microarrays using the same normalization and analysis approach. rna-seq and microarray analysis identified a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes, respectively, that were expressed in the liver. rna-seq analysis for differentially expressed genes  varied dramatically depending on the p <dig> cut-off while microarray results varied more based on the fold change criteria, although responses strongly correlated. verification by wafergen smartchip qrtpcr revealed that rna-seq had a false discovery rate of 24% compared to 54% for microarray analysis. dose–response modeling of rna-seq and microarray data demonstrated similar point of departure  and ed <dig> estimates for common degs.


CONCLUSIONS
there was a strong correspondence between rna-seq and agilent array transcriptome profiling when using the same samples and analysis strategy. however, rna-seq provided superior quantitative data, identifying more genes and degs, as well as qualitative information regarding identity and annotation for dose response modeling in support of regulatory decision-making.
