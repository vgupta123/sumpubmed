BACKGROUND
meat quality is an important economic trait in chickens. to identify loci and genes associated with meat quality traits, we conducted a genome-wide association study  of f <dig> populations derived from a local chinese breed  and a commercial fast-growing broiler line .


RESULTS
in the present study,  <dig> association signals were detected from the compressed mixed linear model  for  <dig> meat quality traits: dry matter in breast muscle , dry matter in thigh muscle , intramuscular fat content in breast muscle , meat color lightness  and yellowness  values, skin color l*, a*  and b* values, abdominal fat weight  and abfw as a percentage of eviscerated weight . relative expressions of candidate genes identified near significant signals were compared using samples of chickens with high and low phenotypic values. a total of  <dig> genes associated with imfbr, meat color l*, abfw, and abfp, were differentially expressed between the high and low phenotypic groups. these genes are, therefore, prospective candidate genes for meat quality traits: protein tyrosine kinase  and microsomal glutathione s-transferase  <dig>  for imfbr; collagen, type i, alpha  <dig>  for meat color l*; and ret proto-oncogene , natriuretic peptide b  and sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor  <dig>  for the abdominal fat  traits.


CONCLUSIONS
based on the association signals and differential expression of nearby genes,  <dig> candidate loci and genes for imfbr, meat l* and b* values, and abf are identified. the results provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying meat quality traits in chickens.
