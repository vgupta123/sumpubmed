BACKGROUND
the family of lysosome-associated membrane proteins  comprises the multifunctional, ubiquitous lamp- <dig> and lamp- <dig>  and the cell type-specific proteins dc-lamp , bad-lamp  and macrosialin . lamps have been implicated in a multitude of cellular processes, including phagocytosis, autophagy, lipid transport and aging. lamp- <dig> isoform a acts as a receptor in chaperone-mediated autophagy. lamp- <dig> deficiency causes the fatal danon disease. the abundant proteins lamp- <dig> and lamp- <dig> are major constituents of the glycoconjugate coat present on the inside of the lysosomal membrane, the 'lysosomal glycocalyx'. the lamp family is characterized by a conserved domain of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids with two disulfide bonds.


RESULTS
the crystal structure of the conserved domain of human dc-lamp was solved. it is the first high-resolution structure of a heavily glycosylated lysosomal membrane protein. the structure represents a novel β-prism fold formed by two β-sheets bent by β-bulges and connected by a disulfide bond. flexible loops and a hydrophobic pocket represent possible sites of molecular interaction. computational models of the glycosylated luminal regions of lamp- <dig> and lamp- <dig> indicate that the proteins adopt a compact conformation in close proximity to the lysosomal membrane. the models correspond to the thickness of the lysosomal glycoprotein coat of only  <dig> to  <dig> nm, according to electron microscopy.


CONCLUSIONS
the conserved luminal domain of lysosome-associated membrane proteins forms a previously unknown β-prism fold. insights into the structure of the lysosomal glycoprotein coat were obtained by computational models of the lamp- <dig> and lamp- <dig> luminal regions.
