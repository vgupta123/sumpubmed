BACKGROUND
the signal output of ethylene receptor family members is mediated by unknown mechanisms to activate the raf-like protein constitutive triple response <dig>  in negatively regulating ethylene signaling. the physical interaction between the ethylene receptor histidine kinase  domain and ctr <dig> n terminus is essential to the ctr1-mediated receptor signal output. to advance our knowledge of the involvement of ctr1-mediated ethylene receptor signaling, we performed a genetic screen for mutations that enhanced the constitutive ethylene response in the weak ctr1- <dig> allele.


RESULTS
we isolated a loss-of-function allele of enhancing ctr1- <dig> ethylene response <dig>  and found that ecr2- <dig> ctr1- <dig> and the strong allele ctr1- <dig> conferred a similar, typical constitutive ethylene response phenotype. genetic analyses and transformation studies suggested that ecr <dig> acts downstream of the ethylene receptors and upstream of the transcription factors ethylene insensitive <dig>  and ein3-like <dig> , which direct the expression of ethylene response genes. signal output by the n terminus of the ethylene receptor ethylene response <dig>  can be mediated by a pathway independent of ctr <dig>  expression of the n terminus of the ethylene-insensitive etr1- <dig> but not the full-length isoform rescued the ecr2- <dig> ctr1- <dig> phenotype, which indicates the involvement of ecr <dig> in ctr1-mediated but not -independent, ethylene receptor signaling. ecr <dig> was mapped to the centromere region on chromosome  <dig>  with incomplete sequence and annotation information and rare chromosome recombination events in this region, the cloning of ecr <dig> is challenging and still in progress.


CONCLUSIONS
ecr <dig> is a novel allele involved in the ethylene receptor signaling that is mediated by ctr <dig>  ctr <dig> activation by ethylene receptors may require ecr <dig> for suppressing the ethylene response.
