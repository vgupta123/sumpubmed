BACKGROUND
klebsiella pneumoniae has emerged worldwide as a cause of pyogenic liver abscess  often complicated by meningitis and endophthalmitis. early detection of this infectious disease will improve its clinical outcome. therefore, we tried to isolate immunodominant proteins secreted by k. pneumoniae strains causing pla.


RESULTS
the secreted proteins of the ntuh-k <dig> strain were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and then immunoblotted using convalescent sera from patients with k. pneumoniae pla. a ~30-kda immunodominant protein was then identified. liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  revealed an open reading frame  located on the pk <dig> plasmid and bioinformatic analysis identified this protein as a signal peptide of unknown function. the kp1_p <dig> gene was more prevalent in pla strains and capsular type k1/k <dig> strains, but disruption of this gene in ntuh-k <dig> strain did not decrease virulence in mice. ten of fourteen  sera from patients with k. pneumoniae pla were immunoreactive with the recombinant kp1_p <dig> protein. seroconversion demonstrated by a rise in serum titer in serial serum samples confirmed that antibodies against the kp1_p <dig> protein were elicited after infection.


CONCLUSIONS
the kp1_p <dig> protein could be used as an antigen for early serodiagnosis of k. pneumoniae pla, particularly in k1/k <dig> pla strains.
