BACKGROUND
to date,  <dig> tick-borne rickettsiae pathogenic for humans are known to occur in africa and  <dig> of them were first identified in ticks before being recognized as human pathogens.


RESULTS
we examined  <dig> and  <dig> amblyomma tholloni ticks from african elephants in the central african republic and gabon, respectively, by pcr amplification and sequencing of a part of glta and ompa genes of the genus rickettsia. the partial sequences of glta and ompa genes detected in tick in gabon had  <dig> % similarity with those of r. heilongjiangensis and  <dig> % with those of rickettsia sp. hl- <dig> strain, respectively. the partial glta and ompa gene sequences detected in tick in the central african republic were  <dig> % and  <dig> % similar to those of rickettsia sp. dns <dig> strain and r. massiliae, respectively. phylogenetic analysis showed rickettsia sp. detected in gabon clusters with r. japonica and r. heilongjiangensis in a phylogenetic tree based on the partial glta and ompa genes. the genotype of the rickettsia sp. detected in the central african republic is close to those of r. massiliae group in the phylogenetic tree based on partial glta gene sequences, and distantly related to other rickettsiae in the tree based on partial ompa gene.


CONCLUSIONS
the degrees of similarity of partial glta and ompa genes with recognized species indicate the rickettsiae detected in this study may be new species although we could only study the partial sequences of  <dig> genes regarding the amount of dna that was available. we propose the rickettsia sp. detected in gabon be provisionally named "rickettsia sp. stain davousti" and rickettsia sp. detected in the central african republic be named "rickettsia sp. strain uilenbergi".
