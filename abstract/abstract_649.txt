BACKGROUND
nmda  is a widely known agonist for a class of glutamate receptors, the nmda type. synthetic nmda elicits very strong activity for the induction of hypothalamic factors and hypophyseal hormones in mammals. moreover, endogenous nmda has been found in rat, where it has a role in the induction of gnrh  in the hypothalamus, and of lh  and prl  in the pituitary gland.


RESULTS
in this study we show evidence for the occurrence of endogenous nmda in the amphioxus branchiostoma lanceolatum. a relatively high concentration of nmda occurs in the nervous system of this species . as in rat, in amphioxus nmda is also biosynthesized from d-aspartic acid  by a nmda synthase .


CONCLUSIONS
given the simplicity of the amphioxus nervous and endocrine systems compared to mammalian, the discovery of nmda in this protochordate is important to gain insights into the role of endogenous nmda in the nervous and endocrine systems of metazoans and particularly in the chordate lineage.
