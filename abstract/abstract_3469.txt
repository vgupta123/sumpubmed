BACKGROUND
the rapid accumulation of data on non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms  should allow us to further our understanding of the underlying disease-associated mechanisms. here, we use complex networks to study the role of an amino acid in both local and global structures and determine the extent to which disease-associated and polymorphic saps differ in terms of their interactions to other residues.


RESULTS
we found that saps can be well characterized by network topological features. mutations are probably disease-associated when they occur at a site with a high centrality value and/or high degree value in a protein structure network. we also discovered that study of the neighboring residues around a mutation site can help to determine whether the mutation is disease-related or not. we compiled a dataset from the swiss-prot variant pages and constructed a model to predict disease-associated saps based on the random forest algorithm. the values of total accuracy and mcc were  <dig> % and  <dig> , respectively, as determined by 5-fold cross-validation. with an independent dataset, our model achieved a total accuracy of  <dig> % and mcc of  <dig> , respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the satisfactory performance suggests that network topological features can be used as quantification measures to determine the importance of a site on a protein, and this approach can complement existing methods for prediction of disease-associated saps. moreover, the use of this method in sap studies would help to determine the underlying linkage between saps and diseases through extensive investigation of mutual interactions between residues.
