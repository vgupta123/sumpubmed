BACKGROUND
echovirus  <dig>  causes various clinical recognized syndromes, mostly with gastrointestinal syndrome and paralysis. the current study summarized the shandong e- <dig> strains isolated from a 26-year acute flaccid paralysis  surveillance, and elucidated the characterization of phylogenetic and phylogeographic relationships of e- <dig> worldwide.


RESULTS
as a predominant serotype circulating in afp surveillance, phylogenetic analysis showed that e- <dig> exhibited both time and geographic subdivision worldwide. in order to know the evolutionary history and spatial temporal dynamics of e- <dig>  evolutionary phylogeography was reconstructed using beast and spread software based on the vp <dig> sequences. the time of the most recent common ancestor of e- <dig> was estimated around  <dig> years and evolved with  <dig>  × 10− <dig> substitutions/site/year. phylogeographic analysis suggested that two regional transmissions of e- <dig> were mainly detected, with one located between europe and africa countries and the other was in the asia-pacific region.


CONCLUSIONS
our study investigates the molecular evolution and phylogeographic of e- <dig>  and brings new insight to the dispersal of e- <dig> worldwide. regional transmission was mainly detected and australia may be responsible for the spread of e- <dig> in recent years.
