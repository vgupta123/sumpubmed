BACKGROUND
mungbean  is an important legume crop with high nutritional value in south and southeast asia. the crop plant is susceptible to a storage pest caused by bruchids . some wild and cultivated mungbean accessions show resistance to bruchids. genomic and transcriptomic comparison of bruchid-resistant and -susceptible mungbean could reveal bruchid-resistant genes  for this pest and give insights into the bruchid resistance of mungbean.


RESULTS
flow cytometry showed that the genome size varied by 61 mb  among the tested mungbean accessions. next generation sequencing followed by de novo assembly of the genome of the bruchid-resistant recombinant inbred line  <dig>  revealed more than  <dig>  genes. transcriptomic comparison of bruchid-resistant and -susceptible parental lines and their offspring identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes  classified into  <dig> major and  <dig> minor bruchid-resistance–associated genes. we found  <dig> nucleotide variations  between bruchid-resistant and -susceptible lines in regions spanning 2 kb  of the promoters of  <dig> degs. furthermore,  <dig> nvs were identified on exons of  <dig> sequence-changed-protein genes . degs and scps comprised genes involved in resistant-related, transposable elements  and conserved metabolic pathways. a large number of these genes were mapped to a region on chromosome  <dig>  molecular markers designed for variants of putative bruchid-resistance–associated genes were highly diagnostic for the bruchid-resistant genotype.


CONCLUSIONS
in addition to identifying bruchid-resistance-associated genes, we found that conserved metabolism and tes may be modifier factors for bruchid resistance of mungbean. the genome sequence of a bruchid-resistant inbred line, candidate genes and sequence variations in promoter regions and exons putatively conditioning resistance as well as markers detecting these variants could be used for development of bruchid-resistant mungbean varieties.
