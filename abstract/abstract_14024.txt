BACKGROUND
documented changes in levels of micrornas  in a variety of diseases including cancer are leading to their development as early indicators of disease, and as a potential new class of therapeutic agents. a significant hurdle to the rational application of mirnas as therapeutics is our current inability to reliably predict the range of molecular and cellular consequences of perturbations in the levels of specific mirnas on targeted cells. while the direct gene  targets of individual mirnas can be computationally predicted with reasonable degrees of accuracy, reliable predictions of the indirect molecular effects of perturbations in mirna levels remain a major challenge in molecular systems biology.


RESULTS
changes in gene  and mirna expression levels between normal precursor and ovarian cancer cells isolated from patient tissue samples were measured by microarray. expression of  <dig> mirnas was significantly elevated in the cancer samples. consistent with previous reports, the expected decrease in expression of the mrna targets of upregulated mirnas was observed in only 20-30% of the cancer samples. we present and provide experimental support for a network model  to account for the unexpected regulatory consequences of modulations in the expression of mirnas on expression levels of their target mrnas in ovarian cancer.


CONCLUSIONS
the direct and indirect regulatory effects of changes in mirna expression levels in vivo are interactive and complex but amenable to systems level modeling. although tom has been developed and validated within the context of ovarian cancer, it may be applicable in other biological contexts as well, including of potential future use in the rational design of mirna-based strategies for the treatment of cancers and other diseases.
