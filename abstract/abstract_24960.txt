BACKGROUND
the hematopoietic stem cells  niche of the bone marrow is comprised of hscs, osteoblasts, endothelial cells and a stromal component of non-hematopoietic multipotent cells of mesenchymal origin named "mesenchymal stem cells" .


RESULTS
here we studied the global transcriptional profile of murine mscs with immuno-therapeutic potential and compared it with that of  <dig> publicly available microarray datasets from  <dig> other mouse tissues or cell types. principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering identified a unique pattern of gene expression capable of distinctively classifying mscs from other tissues and cells. we then performed an analysis aimed to identify absolute and relative abundance of transcripts in all cell types. we found that the set of transcripts uniquely expressed by mscs is enriched in transcription factors and components of the wnt signaling pathway. the analysis of differentially expressed genes also identified a set of genes specifically involved in the hsc niche and is complemented by functional studies that confirm the findings. interestingly, some of these genes play a role in the maintenance of hscs in a quiescent state supporting their survival and preventing them from proliferating and differentiating. we also show that mscs modulate t cell functions in vitro and, upon in vivo administration, ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis .


CONCLUSIONS
altogether, these findings provide novel and important insights on the mechanisms of t cell function regulation by mscs and help to cement the rationale for their application in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
