BACKGROUND
during the past twelve years, lentiviral  vectors have emerged as valuable tools for transgene delivery because of their ability to transduce nondividing cells and their capacity to sustain long-term transgene expression in target cells in vitro and in vivo. however, despite significant progress, the production and concentration of high-titer, high-quality lv vector stocks is still cumbersome and costly.

methods
here we present a simplified protocol for lv vector production on a laboratory scale using hyperflask vessels. hyperflask vessels are high-yield, high-performance flasks that utilize a multilayered gas permeable growth surface for efficient gas exchange, allowing convenient production of high-titer lv vectors. for subsequent concentration of lv vector stocks produced in this way, we describe a facile protocol involving mustang q anion exchange membrane chromatography.


RESULTS
our results show that unconcentrated lv vector stocks with titers in excess of  <dig> transduction units  per ml were obtained using hyperflasks and that these titers were higher than those produced in parallel using regular 150-cm <dig> tissue culture dishes. we also show that up to  <dig> ml of an unconcentrated lv vector stock prepared using a hyperflask vessel could be concentrated using a single mustang q acrodisc with a membrane volume of  <dig>  ml. up to  <dig>  Ã—  <dig> tu were recovered from a single hyperflask vessel.


CONCLUSIONS
the protocol described here is easy to implement and should facilitate high-titer lv vector production for preclinical studies in animal models without the need for multiple tissue culture dishes and ultracentrifugation-based concentration protocols.
