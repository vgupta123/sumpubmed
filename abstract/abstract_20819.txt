BACKGROUND
staphylococci are commonly associated with antibiotic resistance in healthcare settings including resistance to methicillin and other beta lactam antibiotics primarily associated with the carriage of sccmec mobile genetic elements. we investigated oxacillin susceptibility in  <dig> different species of environmental staphylococci to evaluate the potential dissemination of such resistance determinants in staphylococcal isolates from non-healthcare environments.


RESULTS
staphylococci isolated from public washrooms were analysed for sccmec type and for antibiotic susceptibility. mics to oxacillin ranged from  <dig>  to 128 mg/l. of the  <dig> strains investigated, there were representatives of  <dig> different species of staphylococci.  <dig> of the  <dig> isolates were assigned to known sccmec types. these typeable strains primarily included those assigned to sccmec type i , type iv  and type vi . in addition to these isolates,  <dig> strains of emrsa- <dig> were identified from different environmental sites.


CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated the diversity of sccmec elements in a wide range of staphylococcal species isolated from outside of healthcare settings. we have also shown that the variability in oxacillin mics in such isolates are unrelated to species or sccmec type. the isolation of emrsa- <dig> is also of concern to infection control in the community.
