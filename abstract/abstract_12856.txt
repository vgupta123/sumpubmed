BACKGROUND
eisenia fetida, commonly known as red wiggler or compost worm, belongs to the lumbricidae family of the annelida phylum. little is known about its genome sequence although it has been extensively used as a test organism in terrestrial ecotoxicology. in order to understand its gene expression response to environmental contaminants, we cloned  <dig> cdnas or expressed sequence tags  from two e. fetida libraries enriched with genes responsive to ten ordnance related compounds using suppressive subtractive hybridization-pcr.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> good quality ests  were obtained from the raw clone sequences after cleaning. clustering analysis yielded  <dig> unique sequences including  <dig> contigs  and  <dig> singletons. comparative genomic analysis showed that  <dig> or 33% of the unique sequences shared high similarity with existing genes in the genbank nr database. provisional function annotation assigned  <dig> gene ontology terms to  <dig> unique sequences based on their homology with the annotated genomes of four model organisms drosophila melanogaster, mus musculus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and caenorhabditis elegans. seven percent of the unique sequences were further mapped to  <dig> kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathways based on their matching enzyme commission numbers. all the information is stored and retrievable at a highly performed, web-based and user-friendly relational database called est model database or estmd version  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the estmd containing the sequence and annotation information of  <dig> e. fetida ests is publicly accessible at .
