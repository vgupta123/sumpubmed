BACKGROUND
genetic linkage maps are invaluable resources in plant research. they provide a key tool for many genetic applications including: mapping quantitative trait loci ; comparative mapping; identifying unlinked  dna markers for fingerprinting, population genetics and phylogenetics; assisting genome sequence assembly; relating physical and recombination distances along the genome and map-based cloning of genes. eucalypts are the dominant tree species in most australian ecosystems and of economic importance globally as plantation trees. the genome sequence of e. grandis has recently been released providing unprecedented opportunities for genetic and genomic research in the genus. a robust reference linkage map containing sequence-based molecular markers is needed to capitalise on this resource. several high density linkage maps have recently been constructed for the main commercial forestry species in the genus  using sequenced diversity arrays technology  and microsatellite markers. to provide a single reference linkage map for eucalypts a composite map was produced through the integration of data from seven independent mapping experiments  using a marker-merging method.


RESULTS
the composite map totalled 1107 cm and contained  <dig> markers; comprising  <dig> dart,  <dig> microsatellite and eight candidate genes. eighty-one dart markers were mapped to two or more linkage groups, resulting in the  <dig> markers being mapped to  <dig> map positions. approximately 13% of dart markers mapped to identical map positions, thus the composite map contained  <dig> unique loci at an average interval of  <dig>  cm.


CONCLUSIONS
the composite map represents the most saturated linkage map yet produced in eucalyptus. as the majority of dart markers contained on the map have been sequenced, the map provides a direct link to the e. grandis genome sequence and will serve as an important reference for progressing eucalypt research.
