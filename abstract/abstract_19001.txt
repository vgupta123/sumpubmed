BACKGROUND
immunological and genetic findings implicate th <dig> effector cytokines in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease . expression of th <dig> pathway-associated genes is mainly studied in colonic disease. the present study assessed the mrna expression levels of th <dig> effector cytokines  and genes involved in differentiation  and recruitment of th <dig> cells  by quantitative real-time pcr analysis of colonic and ileal biopsies from  <dig> healthy control subjects,  <dig> patients with crohn's disease  and  <dig> patients with ulcerative colitis . inflammation was quantified by measuring expression of the inflammatory mediators il <dig> and tnf.


RESULTS
evaluation of mrna expression levels in colonic and ileal control samples revealed that tnf, tgfb <dig>  stat <dig> and ccr <dig> were expressed at higher levels in the ileum than in the colon. expression of all the th <dig> pathway-associated genes was increased in inflamed colonic samples. the increased expression of these genes was predominantly observed in samples from uc patients and was associated with more intense inflammation. although increased expression of il17a, il17f, il <dig> and il <dig> was detected in inflamed ileal samples, expression of the indispensable th <dig> cell differentiation factors tgfb <dig> and il23a, the signaling molecule stat <dig> and the th <dig> recruitment factors ccr <dig> and ccl <dig> were unchanged.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that immune regulation is different in colonic and ileal disease, which might have important consequences for therapeutic intervention.
