BACKGROUND
structure-based drug design  can provide valuable guidance to drug discovery programs. robust construct design and expression, protein purification and characterization, protein crystallization, and high-resolution diffraction are all needed for rapid, iterative inhibitor design. we describe here robust methods to support sbdd on an oral anti-cytokine drug target, human mapkap kinase  <dig> . our goal was to obtain useful diffraction data with a large number of chemically diverse lead compounds. although mk <dig> structures and structural methods have been reported previously, reproducibility was low and improved methods were needed.


RESULTS
our construct design strategy had four tactics: n- and c-terminal variations; entropy-reducing surface mutations; activation loop deletions; and pseudoactivation mutations. generic, high-throughput methods for cloning and expression were coupled with automated liquid dispensing for the rapid testing of crystallization conditions with minimal sample requirements. initial results led to development of a novel, customized robotic crystallization screen that yielded mk2/inhibitor complex crystals under many conditions in seven crystal forms. in all,  <dig> mk <dig> constructs were generated, ~ <dig> crystals were tested for diffraction, and ~ <dig> structures were determined, delivering high-impact structural data to support our mk <dig> drug design effort.


CONCLUSIONS
key lessons included setting reasonable criteria for construct performance and prioritization, a willingness to design and use customized crystallization screens, and, crucially, initiation of high-throughput construct exploration very early in the drug discovery process.
