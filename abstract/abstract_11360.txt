BACKGROUND
the filamentous fungus trichoderma harzianum is used as biological control agent of several plant-pathogenic fungi. in order to study the genome of this fungus, a functional genomics project called "trichoest" was developed to give insights into genes involved in biological control activities using an approach based on the generation of expressed sequence tags .


RESULTS
eight different cdna libraries from t. harzianum strain cect  <dig> were constructed. different growth conditions involving mainly different nutrient conditions and/or stresses were used. we here present the analysis of the  <dig>  ests generated. a total of  <dig>  unique sequences were identified of which  <dig> % had sequence similarity with genbank entries, using the blastx algorithm. using the gene ontology hierarchy, we performed the annotation of  <dig> % of the unique sequences and compared its distribution among the gene libraries. additionally, the interproscan algorithm was used in order to further characterize the sequences. the identification of the putatively secreted proteins was also carried out. later, based on the est abundance, we examined the highly expressed genes and a hydrophobin was identified as the gene expressed at the highest level. we compared our collection of ests with the previous collections obtained from trichoderma species and we also compared our sequence set with different complete eukaryotic genomes from several animals, plants and fungi. accordingly, the presence of similar sequences in different kingdoms was also studied.


CONCLUSIONS
this est collection and its annotation provide a significant resource for basic and applied research on t. harzianum, a fungus with a high biotechnological interest.
