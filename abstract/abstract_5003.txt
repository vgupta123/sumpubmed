BACKGROUND
genome-wide association studies have identified  <dig> genetic variants associated with colorectal cancer risk to date. however, potential causal genes and pathways regulated by these risk variants remain to be characterized. therefore, we performed gene ontology enrichment and pathway analyses to determine if there was an enrichment of genes in proximity to the colorectal cancer risk variants that could further elucidate the probable causal genes and pathways involved in colorectal cancer biology.


RESULTS
for the  <dig> unique genes that either contained, or were immediately neighboring up- and downstream, of these variants there was a significant enrichment for the kegg pathway, pathways in cancer  and an enrichment for multiple biological processes , such as cell junction organization, tissue morphogenesis, regulation of smad protein phosphorylation, and odontogenesis identified through gene ontology analysis. to identify potential causal genes, we conducted a cis-expression quantitative trait loci  analysis using gene expression and genotype data from the genotype-tissue expression  project portal in normal sigmoid  and transverse  colon tissue. in addition, we also did a cis-eqtl analysis on colorectal tumor tissue  from the cancer genome atlas . we identified two risk alleles that were significant cis-eqtls for fads <dig>  and colca <dig> and  <dig>  genes in the normal transverse colon tissue and two risk alleles that were significant cis-eqtls for the cables <dig>  and lipg  genes in the normal sigmoid colon tissue, but not tumor tissue.


CONCLUSIONS
our data reaffirm the potential to identify an enrichment for biological processes and candidate causal genes based on expression profiles correlated with genetic risk alleles of colorectal cancer, however, the identification of these significant cis-eqtls is context and tissue specific.
