BACKGROUND
excitatory transmitting mechanisms are proving to play a critical role on neuronal homeostasis conditions of facultative hibernators such as the syrian golden hamster. indeed works have shown that the glutamatergic system of the main olfactory brain station  is capable of controlling thermoregulatory responses, which are considered vital for the different hibernating states. in the present study the role of amygdalar glutamatergic circuits on non-hibernating  and hibernating  hamsters were assessed on drinking stimuli and subsequently compared to expression variations of some glutamatergic subtype mrna levels in limbic areas. for this study the two major glutamatergic antagonists and namely that of n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor , 3--2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl-propyl-1-phosphonate  plus that of the acid Î±-amine-3-hydroxy-5-metil-4-isoxazol-propionic receptor  site, cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline- <dig> -dione  were infused into the basolateral amygdala nucleus. attempts were made to establish the type of effects evoked by amygdalar glutamatergic cross-talking processes during drinking stimuli, a response that may corroborate their major role at least during some stages of this physiological activity in hibernators.


RESULTS
from the behavioral results it appears that the two glutamatergic compounds exerted distinct effects. in the first case local infusion of basolateral complexes  with nmdar antagonist caused very great  drinking rhythms while moderately increased feeding  responses during arousal with respect to moderately increased drinking levels in euthermics. conversely, treatment with cnqx did not modify drinking rhythms and so animals spent more time executing exploratory behaviors. these same antagonists accounted for altered glutamatergic transcription activities as displayed by greatly reduced glur <dig>  nr <dig> and glur <dig> levels in hippocampus, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus  and amygdala, respectively, plus a great  up-regulation of glur <dig> in vmn of hibernators.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that predominant drinking events evoked by glutamatergic mechanisms, in the presence of prevalently down regulated levels of nr1/2a of some telencephalic and hypothalamic areas appear to constitute an important neuronal switch at least during arousal stage of hibernation. the establishment of the type of glutamatergic subtypes that are linked to successful hibernating states, via drinking stimuli, may have useful bearings toward sleeping disorders.
