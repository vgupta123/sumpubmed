BACKGROUND
multidrug resistance  <dig>  gene encodes for an atp binding cassette transporter - p-glycoprotein  - involved in chemoresistance to taxanes. mdr <dig> promoter methylation is frequent in prostate carcinoma , suggesting an epigenetic regulation but no functional correlation has been established. we aimed to elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms involved in mdr <dig> deregulation in pca.


RESULTS
mdr <dig> promoter methylation and p-gp expression were assessed in  <dig> pca,  <dig> high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia ,  <dig> benign prostatic hyperplasia  and  <dig> morphologically normal prostate tissue  samples, using quantitative methylation specific pcr and immunohistochemistry, respectively. pca cell lines were exposed to a dna methyltransferases inhibitor 5-aza-2â€²deoxycytidine  and histone deacetylases inhibitor trichostatin a . methylation and histone posttranscriptional modifications status were characterized and correlated with mrna and protein expression. mdr <dig> promoter methylation levels and frequency significantly increased from npts, to hgpin and to pca. conversely, decreased or absent p-gp immunoexpression was observed in hgpin and pca, inversely correlating with methylation levels. exposure to dac alone did not alter significantly methylation levels, although increased expression was apparent. however, p-gp mrna and protein re-expression were higher in cell lines exposed to tsa alone or combined with dac. accordingly, histone active marks h3ac, h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k9ac, and h4ac were increased at the mdr <dig> promoter after exposure to tsa alone or combined with dac.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggests that, in prostate carcinogenesis, mdr <dig> downregulation is mainly due to histone post-translational modifications. this occurs concomitantly with aberrant promoter methylation, substantiating the association with p-gp decreased expression.
