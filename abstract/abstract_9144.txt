BACKGROUND
since the detection of mrsa cc <dig> in pigs in  <dig>  it has emerged in livestock worldwide. mrsa cc <dig> has been found in people in contact with livestock and thus has become a public health issue. data from a large-scale longitudinal study in two danish and four dutch pig herds were used to quantify mrsa cc <dig> transmission rates within pig herds and to identify factors affecting transmission between pigs.


RESULTS
sows and their offspring were sampled at varying intervals during a production cycle. overall mrsa prevalence of sows increased from 33% before farrowing to 77% before weaning. overall mrsa prevalence of piglets was > 60% during the entire study period. the recurrent finding of mrsa in the majority of individuals indicates true colonization or might be the result of contamination. transmission rates were estimated using a susceptible-infectious-susceptible model, which resulted in values of the reproduction ratio  varying from  <dig>  to  <dig> . transmission rates were higher in pigs treated with tetracyclins and β-lactams compared to untreated pigs implying a selective advantage of mrsa cc <dig> when these antimicrobials are used. furthermore, transmission rates were higher in pre-weaning pigs compared to post-weaning pigs which might be explained by an age-related susceptibility or the presence of the sow as a primary source of mrsa cc <dig>  finally, transmission rates increased with the relative increase of the infection pressure within the pen compared to the total infection pressure, implying that within-pen transmission is a more important route compared to between-pen transmission and transmission through environmental exposure.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that mrsa cc <dig> is able to spread and persist in pig herds, resulting in an endemic situation. transmission rates are affected by the use of selective antimicrobials and by the age of pigs.
