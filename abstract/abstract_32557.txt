BACKGROUND
the pirna pathway operates in animal germ lines to ensure genome integrity through retrotransposon silencing. the piwi protein-associated small rnas  guide piwi proteins to retrotransposon transcripts, which are degraded and thereby post-transcriptionally silenced through a ping-pong amplification process. cleavage of the retrotransposon transcript defines at the same time the 5' end of a secondary pirna that will in turn guide a piwi protein to a primary pirna precursor, thereby amplifying primary pirnas. although several studies provided evidence that this mechanism is conserved among metazoa, how the process is initiated and what enzymatic activities are responsible for generating the primary and secondary pirnas are not entirely clear.


RESULTS
here we analyzed small rnas from three mammalian species, seeking to gain further insight into the mechanisms responsible for the pirna amplification loop. we found that in all these species pirna-directed targeting is accompanied by the generation of short sequences that have a very precisely defined length,  <dig> nucleotides, and a specific spatial relationship with the guide pirnas.


CONCLUSIONS
this suggests that the processing of the 5' product of pirna-guided cleavage occurs while the pirna target is engaged by the piwi protein. although they are not stabilized through methylation of their 3' ends, the 19-mers are abundant not only in testes lysates but also in immunoprecipitates of miwi and mili proteins. they will enable more accurate identification of pirna loci in deep sequencing data sets.
