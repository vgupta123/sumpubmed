BACKGROUND
the new jak <dig> inhibitor, cp <dig> , has shown efficacy in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. the present study was undertaken to assess the effects of cp <dig>  on cytokine production and cellular signaling in human cd4+ t cells.


RESULTS
cd4+ t cells produced il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and ifn-γ in following stimulation with a cd <dig> antibody. at the optimal concentration, cp <dig>  almost completely inhibited the production of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and ifn-γ from these activated cd4+ t cells, but only had marginal effects on il- <dig> production. moreover cp <dig>  inhibited anti-cd3-induced phosphorylation of stat <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig>  and stat <dig>  but not the tcr-associated phosphorylation of zap- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
therefore, cp <dig> -mediated modification of the jak/stat pathway may be a new immunosuppressive strategy in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
