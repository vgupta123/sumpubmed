BACKGROUND
sequencing datasets consist of a finite number of reads which map to specific regions of a reference genome. most effort in modeling these datasets focuses on the detection of univariate differentially expressed genes. however, for classification, we must consider multiple genes and their interactions.


RESULTS
thus, we introduce a hierarchical multivariate poisson model  and the associated optimal bayesian classifier  for classifying samples using sequencing data. lacking closed-form solutions, we employ a monte carlo markov chain  approach to perform classification. we demonstrate superior or equivalent classification performance compared to typical classifiers for two synthetic datasets and over a range of classification problem difficulties. we also introduce the bayesian minimum mean squared error  conditional error estimator and demonstrate its computation over the feature space. in addition, we demonstrate superior or leading class performance over an rna-seq dataset containing two lung cancer tumor types from the cancer genome atlas .


CONCLUSIONS
through model-based, optimal bayesian classification, we demonstrate superior classification performance for both synthetic and real rna-seq datasets. a tutorial video and python source code is available under an open source license at http://bit.ly/1gimnss.
