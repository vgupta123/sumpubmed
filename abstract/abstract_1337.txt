BACKGROUND
trichoderma reesei is the main industrial source of cellulases and hemicellulases required for the hydrolysis of biomass to simple sugars, which can then be used in the production of biofuels and biorefineries. the highly productive strains in use today were generated by classical mutagenesis. as byproducts of this procedure, mutants were generated that turned out to be unable to produce cellulases. in order to identify the mutations responsible for this inability, we sequenced the genome of one of these strains, qm <dig>  and compared it to that of its progenitor t. reesei qm6a.


RESULTS
in qm <dig>  we detected a surprisingly low number of mutagenic events in the promoter and coding regions of genes, i.e. only eight indels and six single nucleotide variants. one of these indels led to a frame-shift in the zn2cys <dig> transcription factor xyr <dig>  the general regulator of cellulase and xylanase expression, and resulted in its c-terminal truncation by  <dig> amino acids. retransformation of strain qm <dig> with the wild-type xyr <dig> allele fully recovered the ability to produce cellulases, and is thus the reason for the cellulase-negative phenotype. introduction of an engineered xyr <dig> allele containing the truncating point mutation into the moderate producer t. reesei qm <dig> rendered this strain also cellulase-negative. the correspondingly truncated xyr <dig> protein was still able to enter the nucleus, but failed to be expressed over the basal constitutive level.


CONCLUSIONS
the missing  <dig> c-terminal amino acids of xyr <dig> are therefore responsible for its previously observed auto-regulation which is essential for cellulases to be expressed. our data present a working example of the use of genome sequencing leading to a functional explanation of the qm <dig> cellulase-negative phenotype.
