BACKGROUND
habitat fragmentation is considered to be a main reason for decreasing genetic diversity of plant species. however, the results of many fragmentation studies are inconsistent. this may be due to the influence of habitat conditions, having an indirect effect on genetic variation via reproduction. consequently we took a comparative approach to analyse the impact of habitat fragmentation and habitat conditions on the genetic diversity of calcareous grassland species in this study. we selected five typical grassland species  occurring in  <dig> fragments of calcareous grasslands in south eastern germany. we sampled  <dig> individuals in  <dig> populations and analysed genetic diversity using amplified fragment length polymorphisms. additionally, we collected data concerning habitat fragmentation  and habitat conditions  of the selected study sites. the whole data set was analysed using bayesian multiple regressions.


RESULTS
our investigation indicated a habitat loss of nearly 80% and increasing isolation between grasslands since  <dig>  bayesian analysis revealed a significant impact of the historical landscape structure, whereas habitat conditions played no important role for the present-day genetic variation of the studied plant species.


CONCLUSIONS
our study indicates that the historical landscape structure may be more important for genetic diversity than present habitat conditions. populations persisting in abandoned grassland fragments may contribute significantly to the species’ variability even under deteriorating habitat conditions. therefore, these populations should be included in approaches to preserve the genetic variation of calcareous grassland species.
