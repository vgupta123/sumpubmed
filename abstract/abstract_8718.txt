BACKGROUND
insect cells can serve as host systems for the recombinant expression of eukaryotic proteins. using this platform, the controlled expression of 15n/13c labelled proteins requires the analysis of incorporation paths and rates of isotope-labelled precursors present in the medium into amino acids. for this purpose, spodoptera frugiperda cells were grown in a complex medium containing glucose. in a second experiment, cultures of s. frugiperda were grown in the presence of 15n-phenylalanine.


RESULTS
quantitative nmr analysis showed incorporation of the proffered glucose into the ribose moiety of ribonucleosides  and into the amino acids, alanine , glutamic acid/glutamine  and aspartate/asparagine . other amino acids and the purine ring of nucleosides were not formed from exogenous glucose in significant amounts . prior to the incorporation into protein the proffered 15n-phenylalanine lost about 70% of its label by transamination and the labelled compound was not converted into tyrosine to a significant extent.


CONCLUSIONS
growth of s. frugiperda cells in the presence of glucose is conducive to the fractional labelling of ribonucleosides, alanine, glutamic acid/glutamine and aspartic acid/asparagine. the isotopolog compositions of the ribonucleosides and of alanine indicate considerable recycling of carbohydrate intermediates in the reductive branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. the incorporation of 15n-labelled amino acids may be hampered by loss of the 15n-label by transamination.
