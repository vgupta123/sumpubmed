BACKGROUND
resistance and growth are opposing characteristics in plants. sa insensitivity of npr1- <dig>  encodes a stearoyl-acp desaturase  that has previously been reported to simultaneously enhance resistance and repress growth.


RESULTS
here, we characterize ssi2- <dig>  a novel mutant allele of ssi <dig> that has two amino acid substitutions. compared with wild-type and two other mutants of ssi <dig>  ssi2- <dig> showed intermediate phenotypes in growth size, punctate necrosis, resistance to the bacterial pathogen pst dc <dig>  salicylic acid  content, pathogenesis-related  gene levels and 18: <dig> content. these results indicate that ssi2- <dig> is a weak mutant of ssi <dig>  additionally, by using ssi2- <dig> as an intermediate control, a number of differentially expressed genes were identified in transcriptome profiling analysis. these results suggest that constitutive expression of defense-related genes and repression of iaa signaling-associated genes is present in all ssi <dig> mutants.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our results suggest that the weak ssi2- <dig> mutant maintains a better balance between plant immunity and vegetative growth than other mutants, consequently providing a basis to genetically engineer disease resistance in crop plants.
