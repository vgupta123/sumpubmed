BACKGROUND
polyploidization is considered one of the main mechanisms of plant genome evolution. the presence of multiple copies of the same gene reduces selection pressure and permits sub-functionalization and neo-functionalization leading to plant diversification, adaptation and speciation. in bread wheat, polyploidization and the prevalence of transposable elements resulted in massive gene duplication and movement. as a result, the number of genes which are non-collinear to genomes of related species seems markedly increased in wheat.


RESULTS
we used new-generation sequencing  to generate sequence of a mb-sized region from wheat chromosome arm 3ds. sequence assembly of  <dig> bac clones resulted in two scaffolds of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig>  bases. the sequence was annotated and compared to the homoeologous region on wheat chromosome 3b and orthologous loci of brachypodium distachyon and rice. among  <dig> coding sequences in the 3ds scaffolds,  <dig> have a homoeolog on chromosome 3b. in contrast, only fifteen and fourteen orthologs were identified in the corresponding regions in rice and brachypodium, respectively. interestingly, five pseudogenes were identified among the non-collinear coding sequences at the 3b locus, while none was found at the 3ds locus.


CONCLUSIONS
direct comparison of two mb-sized regions of the b and d genomes of bread wheat revealed similar rates of non-collinear gene insertion in both genomes with a majority of gene duplications occurring before their divergence. relatively low proportion of pseudogenes was identified among non-collinear coding sequences. our data suggest that the pseudogenes did not originate from insertion of non-functional copies, but were formed later during the evolution of hexaploid wheat. some evidence was found for gene erosion along the b genome locus.
