BACKGROUND
the objective of this study was to determine the genetic lineages and the incidence of antibiotic resistance and virulence determinants of nasal staphylococcus aureus isolates of healthy donkeys destined to food consumption in tunisia.


RESULTS
nasal swabs of  <dig> donkeys obtained in a large slaughterhouse in  <dig> were inoculated in specific media for s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. aureus  recovery. s. aureus was obtained in 50% of the samples, being all of isolates methicillin-susceptible . genetic lineages, toxin gene profile, and antibiotic resistance mechanisms were determined in recovered isolates. twenty-five different spa-types were detected among the  <dig> mssa with  <dig> novel spa-types. s. aureus isolates were ascribed to agr type i , iii , ii , and iv . sixteen different sequence-types  were revealed by mlst, with seven new ones. sts belonging to clonal clomplex cc <dig> were majority. the gene tst was detected in  <dig> isolates and the gene etb in one isolate. different combinations of enterotoxin, leukocidin and haemolysin genes were identified among s. aureus isolates. the egc-cluster-like and an incomplete egc-cluster-like were detected. isolates resistant to penicillin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, streptomycin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, tetracycline, or chloramphenicol were found and the genes blaz, erm, erm, tet, fusc were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
the nares of donkeys frequently harbor mssa. they could be reservoirs of the ruminant-associated cc <dig> lineage and of toxin genes encoding tsst- <dig> and other virulence traits with potential implications in public health. cc <dig> seems to have a broader host distribution than expected.
