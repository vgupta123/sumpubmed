BACKGROUND
the  <dig> kda ribosomal protein s <dig> kinase , located at 17q <dig>  is amplified and overexpressed in 10â€“30% of primary breast cancers and breast cancer cell lines. p70s6k is a serine/threonine kinase regulated by pi3k/mtor pathway, which plays a crucial role in control of cell cycle, growth and survival. our aim was to determine p70s6k and pi3k/mtor/p70s6k pathway dependent gene expression profiles by microarrays using five breast cancer cell lines with predefined gene copy number and gene expression alterations. the p70s6k dependent profiles were determined by sirna silencing of rps6kb <dig> in two breast cancer cell lines overexpressing p70s6k. these profiles were further correlated with gene expression alterations caused by inhibition of pi3k/mtor pathway with pi3k inhibitor ly <dig> or mtor inhibitor rapamycin.


RESULTS
altogether, the silencing of p70s6k altered the expression of  <dig> and  <dig> genes in two breast cancer cell lines and  <dig> genes were altered in both cell lines in addition to rps6kb <dig>  furthermore,  <dig> genes including vtcn <dig> and cdkn2b showed overlap with genes differentially expressed after pi3k or mtor inhibition. the gene expression signatures responsive to both pi3k/mtor pathway and p70s6k inhibitions revealed previously unidentified genes suggesting novel downstream targets for pi3k/mtor/p70s6k pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
since p70s6k overexpression is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis of breast cancer patients, the potential downstream targets of p70s6k and the whole pi3k/mtor/p70s6k pathway identified in our study may have diagnostic value.
