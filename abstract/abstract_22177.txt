BACKGROUND
the ability to grow in phosphorus-depleted soils is an important trait for rice cultivation in many world regions, especially in the tropics. the phosphorus starvation tolerance  <dig>  gene has been identified as underlying the ability of some cultivated rice varieties to grow under low-phosphorus conditions; however, the gene is absent from other varieties. we assessed pstol <dig> presence/absence in a geographically diverse sample of wild, domesticated and weedy rice and sequenced the gene in samples where it is present.


RESULTS
we find that the presence/absence polymorphism spans cultivated, weedy and wild asian rice groups. for the subset of samples that carry pstol <dig>  haplotype sequences suggest long-term selective maintenance of functional alleles, but with repeated evolution of loss-of-function alleles through premature stops and frameshift mutations. the loss-of-function alleles have evolved convergently in multiple rice species and cultivated rice varieties. greenhouse assessments of plant growth under low- and high-phosphorus conditions did not reveal significant associations with pstol <dig> genotype variation; however, the striking signature of balancing selection at this locus suggests that further phenotypic characterizations of pstol <dig> allelic variants is warranted and may be useful for crop improvement.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest balancing selection for both functional and non-functional pstol <dig> alleles that predates and transcends asian rice domestication, a pattern that may reflect fitness tradeoffs associated with geographical variation in soil phosphorus content.
