BACKGROUND
transcranial magnetic stimulation  commonly uses so-called monophasic pulses where the initial rapidly changing current flow is followed by a critically dampened return current. it has been shown that a monophasic tms pulse preferentially excites different cortical circuits in the human motor hand area , if the induced tissue current has a posterior-to-anterior  or anterior-to-posterior  direction. here we tested whether similar direction-specific effects could be elicited in m1-hand using tms pulses with a half-sine wave configuration.


RESULTS
in  <dig> young participants, we applied half-sine pulses to the right m1-hand which elicited pa or ap currents with respect to the orientation of the central sulcus.

measurements of the motor evoked potential  revealed that pa half-sine stimulation resulted in lower resting motor threshold  than ap stimulation. when stimulus intensity  was gradually increased as percentage of maximal stimulator output, the stimulus–response curve  of mep amplitude showed a leftward shift for pa as opposed to ap half-sine stimulation. further, mep latencies were approximately  <dig> ms shorter for pa relative to ap half-sine stimulation across the entire si range tested. when adjusting si to the respective rmt of pa and ap stimulation, the direction-specific differences in mep latencies persisted, while the gain function of mep amplitudes was comparable for pa and ap stimulation.


CONCLUSIONS
using half-sine pulse configuration, single-pulse tms elicits consistent direction-specific effects in m1-hand that are similar to tms with monophasic pulses. the longer mep latency for ap half-sine stimulation suggests that pa and ap half-sine stimulation preferentially activates different sets of cortical neurons that are involved in the generation of different corticospinal descending volleys.
