BACKGROUND
our prior characterization of rasgrf <dig> deficient mice uncovered significant defects in pancreatic islet count and size as well as beta cell development and signaling function, raising question about the mechanisms linking rasgrf <dig> to the generation of those “pancreatic” phenotypes.


RESULTS
here, we compared the transcriptional profile of highly purified pancreatic islets from rasgrf <dig> ko mice to that of wt control animals using commercial oligonucleotide microarrays. rasgrf <dig> elimination resulted in differential gene expression of numerous components of mapk- and calcium-signaling pathways, suggesting a relevant contribution of this gef to modulation of cellular signaling in the cell lineages integrating the pancreatic islets. whereas the overall transcriptional profile of pancreatic islets was highly specific in comparison to other organs of the same ko mice, a significant specific repression of pttg <dig> was a common transcriptional alteration shared with other tissues of neuroectodermal origin. this observation, together with the remarkable pancreatic phenotypic similarities between rasgrf <dig> ko and pttg <dig> ko mice suggested the possibility of proximal functional regulatory links between rasgrf <dig> and pttg <dig> in pancreatic cell lineages expressing these proteins.

analysis of the mpttg <dig> promoter region identified specific recognition sites for numerous transcription factors which were also found to be differentially expressed in rasgrf <dig> ko pancreatic islets and are known to be relevant for ras-erk signaling as well as beta cell function. reporter luciferase assays in bt <dig> insulinoma cells demonstrated the ability of rasgrf <dig> to modulate mpttg <dig> promoter activity through erk-mediated signals. analysis of the phenotypic interplay between rasgrf <dig> and pttg <dig> in double knockout rasgrf1/pttg <dig> mice showed that combined elimination of the two loci resulted in dramatically reduced values of islet and beta cell count and glucose homeostasis function which neared those measured in single pttg <dig> ko mice and were significantly lower than those observed in individual rasgrf <dig> ko mice.


CONCLUSIONS
the specific transcriptional profile and signaling behavior of rasggrf <dig> ko pancreatic islets, together with the dominance of pttg <dig> over rasgrf <dig> with regards to the generation of these phenotypes in mouse pancreas, suggest that rasgrf <dig> is an important upstream component of signal transduction pathways regulating pttg <dig> expression and controlling beta cell development and physiological responses.
