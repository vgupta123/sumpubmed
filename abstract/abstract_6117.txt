BACKGROUND
protein phosphorylation catalyzed by kinases plays crucial regulatory roles in intracellular signal transduction. due to the difficulty in performing high-throughput mass spectrometry-based experiment, there is a desire to predict phosphorylation sites using computational methods. however, previous studies regarding in silico prediction of plant phosphorylation sites lack the consideration of kinase-specific phosphorylation data. thus, we are motivated to propose a new method that investigates different substrate specificities in plant phosphorylation sites.


RESULTS
experimentally verified phosphorylation data were extracted from tair9-a protein database containing  <dig> phosphorylation data from the plant species arabidopsis thaliana. in an attempt to investigate the various substrate motifs in plant phosphorylation, maximal dependence decomposition  is employed to cluster a large set of phosphorylation data into subgroups containing significantly conserved motifs. profile hidden markov model  is then applied to learn a predictive model for each subgroup. cross-validation evaluation on the mdd-clustered hmms yields an average accuracy of  <dig> % for serine,  <dig> % for threonine, and  <dig> % for tyrosine models. moreover, independent test results using arabidopsis thaliana phosphorylation data from uniprotkb/swiss-prot show that the proposed models are able to correctly predict  <dig> % phosphoserine,  <dig> % phosphothreonine, and  <dig> % phosphotyrosine sites. interestingly, several mdd-clustered subgroups are observed to have similar amino acid conservation with the substrate motifs of well-known kinases from phospho.elm-a database containing kinase-specific phosphorylation data from multiple organisms.


CONCLUSIONS
this work presents a novel method for identifying plant phosphorylation sites with various substrate motifs. based on cross-validation and independent testing, results show that the mdd-clustered models outperform models trained without using mdd. the proposed method has been implemented as a web-based plant phosphorylation prediction tool, plantphos http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/plantphos/. additionally, two case studies have been demonstrated to further evaluate the effectiveness of plantphos.
