BACKGROUND
y. enterocolitica biotype  1a strains are often isolated from human clinical samples but their contribution to disease has remained a controversial topic. variation and the population structure among the clinical y. enterocolitica bt 1a isolates have been poorly characterized. we used multi-locus sequence typing , 16s rrna gene sequencing, pcr for ysta and ystb, lipopolysaccharide analysis, phage typing, human serum complement killing assay and analysis of the symptoms of the patients to characterize  <dig> clinical y. enterocolitica bt 1a isolates in order to evaluate their relatedness and pathogenic potential.


RESULTS
a subset of  <dig> bt 1a strains, selected based on their varying lps patterns, were subjected to detailed genetic analyses. the mlst on seven house-keeping genes  conducted on  <dig> of the strains discriminated them into  <dig> mlst-types. by bayesian analysis of the population structure  the strains clustered conclusively into two distinct lineages, i.e. genetic groups  <dig> and  <dig>  the strains of genetic group  <dig> were more closely related  to the pathogenic bio/serotype 4/o: <dig> strains than genetic group  <dig> strains . further comparison of the 16s rrna genes of the bt 1a strains indicated that altogether  <dig> of the  <dig> strains belong to genetic group  <dig>  on the 16s rrna analysis, these  <dig> strains were only 98% similar to the previously identified subspecies of y. enterocolitica. the strains of genetic group  <dig> were uniform in their pathogenecity-related properties: they lacked the ystb gene, belonged to the same lps subtype or were of rough type, were all resistant to the five tested yersiniophages, were largely resistant to serum complement and did not ferment fucose. the  <dig> strains in genetic group  <dig> showed much more variation in these properties. the most commonly detected lps types were similar to the lps types of reference strains with serotypes o: <dig>  and o: <dig>  , o: <dig>   and o: <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study strengthen the assertion that strains classified as y. enterocolitica bt 1a represent more than one subspecies. especially the bt 1a strains in our genetic group  <dig> commonly showed resistance to human serum complement killing, which may indicate pathogenic potential for these strains. however, their virulence mechanisms remain unknown.
