BACKGROUND
consistent progress in the development of bacteriophage lambda display platform as an alternative to filamentous phage display system was achieved in the recent years. the lambda phage has been engineered to display efficiently multiple copies of peptides or even large protein domains providing a powerful tool for screening libraries of peptides, proteins and cdna.


RESULTS
in the present work we describe an original method for dual display of large proteins on the surface of lambda particles. an anti-cea single-chain antibody fragment and green fluorescent protein or alkaline phosphatase were simultaneously displayed by engineering both gpd and gpv lambda proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
here we show that such modified phage particles can be used for the detection of target molecules in vitro and in vivo. dual expression of functional moieties on the surface of the lambda phage might open the way to generation of a new class of diagnostic and therapeutic targeted nanoparticles.
