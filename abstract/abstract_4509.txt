BACKGROUND
five dna regions, namely, rbcl, matk, its, its <dig>  and psba-trnh, have been recommended as primary dna barcodes for plants. studies evaluating these regions for species identification in the large plant taxon, which includes a large number of closely related species, have rarely been reported.


RESULTS
the feasibility of using the five proposed dna regions was tested for discriminating plant species within asteraceae, the largest family of flowering plants. among these markers, its <dig> was the most useful in terms of universality, sequence variation, and identification capability in the asteraceae family. the species discriminating power of its <dig> was also explored in a large pool of  <dig>  asteraceae sequences that represent  <dig>  species belonging to  <dig> different genera. the result shows that its <dig> correctly identified  <dig> % and  <dig> % of plant samples at the species and genus levels, respectively. in addition, its <dig> displayed a variable ability to discriminate related species within different genera.


CONCLUSIONS
its <dig> is the best dna barcode for the asteraceae family. this approach significantly broadens the application of dna barcoding to resolve classification problems in the family asteraceae at the genera and species levels.
