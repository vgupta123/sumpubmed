BACKGROUND
bombyx mori, the domesticated silkworm, is a well-studied model insect with great economic and scientific significance. although more than  <dig> mutations have been described in silkworms, most have not been identified, especially those affecting economically-important traits. simple sequence repeats  are effective and economical tools for mapping traits and genetic improvement. the current ssr linkage map is of low density and contains few polymorphisms. the purpose of this work was to develop a dense and informative linkage map that would assist in the preliminary mapping and dissection of quantitative trait loci  in a variety of silkworm strains.


RESULTS
through an analysis of >  <dig>  genotypes across new mapping populations, we constructed two new linkage maps covering  <dig> assigned chromosomes and merged the data with previously reported data sets. the integrated consensus map contains  <dig> unique ssr sites, improving the density from  <dig>  cm in the previous map to  <dig>  cm. we also developed  <dig> confirmed neighboring markers for corresponding low-polymorphism sites, with  <dig> having polymorphisms. large-scale statistics on the ssr type were suggestive of highly efficient markers, based upon which we searched  <dig>  available genomic scaffolds for ssr loci. with the newly constructed map, we mapped single-gene traits, the qtl of filaments, and a number of ribosomal protein genes.


CONCLUSIONS
the integrated map produced in this study is a highly efficient genetic tool for the high-throughput mapping of single genes and qtl. compared to previous maps, the current map offers a greater number of markers and polymorphisms; thus, it may be used as a resource for marker-assisted breeding.
