BACKGROUND
the major facilitator superfamily  is one of the two largest superfamilies of membrane transporters present ubiquitously in bacteria, archaea, and eukarya and includes members that function as uniporters, symporters or antiporters. we report here the complete transportome of mfs proteins of a human pathogenic yeast candida albicans.


RESULTS
computational analysis of c. albicans genome enabled us to identify  <dig> potential mfs proteins which clustered into  <dig> families using saier's transport commission  system. among these sp, dha <dig>  dha <dig> and acs represented major families consisting of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively. family designations in c. albicans were validated by subjecting saccharomyces cerevisiae genome to tc system. based on the published available genomics/proteomics data,  <dig> of the putative mfs genes of c. albicans were found to express either at mrna or protein levels. we checked the expression of the remaining  <dig> genes by using rt-pcr and observed that they are not expressed under basal growth conditions implying that either these  <dig> genes are expressed under specific growth conditions or they may be candidates for pseudogenes.


CONCLUSIONS
the in silico characterisation of mfs transporters in candida albicans genome revealed a large complement of mfs transporters with most of them showing expression. considering the clinical relevance of c. albicans and role of mfs members in antifungal resistance and nutrient transport, this analysis would pave way for identifying their physiological relevance.
