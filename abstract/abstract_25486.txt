BACKGROUND
micrornas  are key regulators of biological processes. to define mirna function in the eye, it is essential to determine a high-resolution profile of their spatial and temporal distribution.


RESULTS
in this report, we present the first comprehensive survey of mirna expression in ocular tissues, using both microarray and rna in situ hybridization  procedures. we initially determined the expression profiles of mirnas in the retina, lens, cornea and retinal pigment epithelium of the adult mouse eye by microarray. each tissue exhibited notably distinct mirna enrichment patterns and cluster analysis identified groups of mirnas that showed predominant expression in specific ocular tissues or combinations of them. next, we performed rna ish for over  <dig> mirnas, including those showing the highest expression levels by microarray, and generated a high-resolution expression atlas of mirnas in the developing and adult wild-type mouse eye, which is accessible in the form of a publicly available web database. we found that  <dig> mirnas displayed restricted expression domains in the eye at different developmental stages, with the majority of them expressed in one or more cell layers of the neural retina.


CONCLUSIONS
this analysis revealed mirnas with differential expression in ocular tissues and provided a detailed atlas of their tissue-specific distribution during development of the murine eye. the combination of the two approaches offers a valuable resource to decipher the contributions of specific mirnas and mirna clusters to the development of distinct ocular structures.
