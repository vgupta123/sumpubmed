BACKGROUND
the evaluation of intestinal trophism, mainly the mucosal layer, is an important issue in various conditions associated with injury, atrophy, recovery, and healing of the gut. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the kinetics of the proliferation and apoptosis of enterocytes by immunohistochemistry and to assess the complexity of intestinal mucosa by fractal dimension  analysis in solea solea fed different experimental diets.


RESULTS
histomorphological evaluation of all intestinal segments did not show signs of degeneration or inflammation. cell proliferation index and fd were significantly reduced with a diet high in mussel meal , while apoptotic index did not show any significant difference for the same comparison . linear regression analysis between apoptotic index  and fd  showed a statistically significant inverse relationship . linear regression analysis between cell proliferation index  and fd  did not show any significant correlation .


CONCLUSIONS
the results demonstrated that diets containing increasing levels of mussel meal in substitution of fishmeal did not incite a hyperplastic response of the intestinal mucosa. the mussel meal, which is derived from molluscs, could mimic the characteristics of the soleâ€™s natural prey, being readily digestible, even without increasing the absorptive surface of intestinal mucosa. interestingly, from this study emerged that fd could be used as a numeric indicator complementary to in situ quantification methods to measure intestinal trophism, in conjunction with functional parameters.
