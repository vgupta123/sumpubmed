BACKGROUND
harpalinae is a species rich clade of carabid beetles with many unusual morphological forms and ecological interactions. how this diversity evolved has been difficult to reconstruct, perhaps because harpalines underwent a rapid burst of diversification early in their evolutionary history. here we investigate the tempo of evolution in harpalines using molecular divergence dating techniques and explore the rates of lineage accumulation in harpalines and their sister group.


RESULTS
according to molecular divergence date estimates, harpalines originated in the mid cretaceous but did not diversify extensively until the late cretaceous or early paleogene about  <dig> million years after their origin. in a relatively small window of time, harpalines underwent rapid speciation. harpalines have a relative high net diversification rate and increased cladogenesis in some regions of the clade. we did not see a significant decrease in diversification rate through time in the mccr test, but a model of diversification with two shift points to lower diversification rates fit the harpaline lineage accumulation through time the best.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate harpalines are significantly more diverse and have higher diversification than their sistergroup. instead of an immediate burst of explosive diversification, harpalines may have had a long "fuse" before major lineages diversified during the early paleogene when other taxa such as mammals, birds, and some flowering plants were also rapidly diversifying.
