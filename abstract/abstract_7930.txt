BACKGROUND
tubulin cofactor a , one of the members of tubulin cofactors, is of great importance in microtubule functions through participating in the folding of α/β-tubulin heterodimers in saccharomyces cerevisiae. however, little is known about the roles of tbca in filamentous fungi.


RESULTS
in this study, we characterized a tbca orthologue fatbca in fusarium asiaticum. the deletion of fatbca caused dramatically reduced mycelial growth and abnormal conidiation. the fatbca deletion mutant  showed increased sensitivity to low temperatures and even lost the ability of growth at 4°c. microscopic observation found that hyphae of Δfatbca- <dig> exhibited blebbing phenotypes after shifting from  <dig> to 4°c for 1- or 3-day incubation and approximately 72% enlarged nodes contained several nuclei after 3-day incubation at 4°c. however, hyphae of the wild type incubated at 4°c were phenotypically indistinguishable from those incubated at 25°c. these results indicate that fatbca is involved in cell division under cold stress  in f. asiaticum. unexpectedly, Δfatbca- <dig> did not exhibit increased sensitivity to the anti-microtubule drug carbendazim although quantitative real-time assays showed that the expression of fatbca was up-regulated after treatment with carbendazim. in addition, pathogenicity assays showed that Δfatbca- <dig> exhibited decreased virulence on wheat head and on non-host tomato.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, results of this study indicate that fatbca plays crucial roles in vegetative growth, conidiation, temperature sensitivity and virulence in f. asiaticum.
