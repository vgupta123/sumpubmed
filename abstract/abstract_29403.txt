BACKGROUND
high salinity is a major environmental stress influencing growth and development of rice. comparative proteomic analysis of hybrid rice shoot proteins from shanyou  <dig> seedlings, a salt-tolerant hybrid variety, and liangyoupeijiu seedlings, a salt-sensitive hybrid variety, was performed to identify new components involved in salt-stress signaling.


RESULTS
phenotypic analysis of one protein that was upregulated during salt-induced stress, cyclophilin  <dig> , indicated that oscyp <dig> transgenic rice seedlings had better tolerance to salt stress than did wild-type seedlings. interestingly, wild-type seedlings exhibited a marked reduction in maximal photochemical efficiency under salt stress, whereas no such change was observed for oscyp2-transgenic seedlings. oscyp2-transgenic seedlings had lower levels of lipid peroxidation products and higher activities of antioxidant enzymes than wild-type seedlings. spatiotemporal expression analysis of oscyp <dig> showed that it could be induced by salt stress in both shanyou  <dig> and liangyoupeijiu seedlings, but shanyou  <dig> seedlings showed higher oscyp <dig> expression levels. moreover, circadian rhythm expression of oscyp <dig> in shanyou  <dig> seedlings occurred earlier than in liangyoupeijiu seedlings. treatment with peg, heat, or aba induced oscyp <dig> expression in shanyou  <dig> seedlings but inhibited its expression in liangyoupeijiu seedlings. cold stress inhibited oscyp <dig> expression in shanyou  <dig> and liangyoupeijiu seedlings. in addition, oscyp <dig> was strongly expressed in shoots but rarely in roots in two rice hybrid varieties.


CONCLUSIONS
together, these data suggest that oscyp <dig> may act as a key regulator that controls ros level by modulating activities of antioxidant enzymes at translation level. oscyp <dig> expression is not only induced by salt stress, but also regulated by circadian rhythm. moreover, oscyp <dig> is also likely to act as a key component that is involved in signal pathways of other types of stresses-peg, heat, cold, or aba.
