BACKGROUND
teneurin- <dig> is a member of a family of type ii transmembrane proteins conserved from c.elegans to vertebrates. teneurin expression in vertebrates is best studied in mouse and chicken, where the four members teneurin- <dig> to - <dig> are predominantly expressed in the developing nervous system in area specific patterns. based on their distinct, complementary expression a possible function in the establishment of proper connectivity in the brain was postulated. however, the transcription factors contributing to these distinctive expression patterns are largely unknown. emx <dig> is a homeobox transcription factor, known to be important for area specification in the developing cortex. a study of emx <dig> knock-out mice suggested a role of emx <dig> in regulating patterned teneurin expression.


RESULTS
5'race of human teneurin- <dig> revealed new alternative untranslated exons that are conserved in mouse and chicken. closer analysis of the conserved region around the newly identified transcription start revealed promoter activity that was induced by emx <dig>  mutation of a predicted homeobox binding site decreased the promoter activity in different reporter assays in vitro and in vivo in electroporated chick embryos. we show direct in vivo binding of emx <dig> to the newly identified promoter element and finally confirm that the endogenous alternate transcript is specifically upregulated by emx <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we found that human teneurin- <dig> is directly regulated by emx <dig> at a newly identified and conserved promoter region upstream of the published transcription start site, establishing teneurin- <dig> as the first human emx <dig> target gene. we identify and characterize the emx <dig> dependent promoter element of human teneurin- <dig>
