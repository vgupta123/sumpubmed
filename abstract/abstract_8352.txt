BACKGROUND
specialization for ecological niches is a balance of evolutionary adaptation and its accompanying tradeoffs. here we focus on the lenski long-term evolution experiment, which has maintained cultures of escherichia coli in the same defined seasonal environment for  <dig>  generations. over this time, much adaptation and specialization to the environment has occurred. the presence of citrate in the growth media selected one lineage to gain the novel ability to utilize citrate as a carbon source after  <dig>  generations. here we test whether other strains have specialized to rely on citrate after  <dig>  generations.


RESULTS
we show that in addition to the citrate-catabolizing strain, three other lineages evolving in parallel have acquired a dependence on citrate for optimal growth on glucose. none of these strains were stimulated indirectly by the sodium present in disodium citrate, nor exhibited even partial utilization of citrate as a carbon source. instead, all three of these citrate-stimulated populations appear to rely on it as a chelator of iron.


CONCLUSIONS
the strains we examine here have evolved specialization to their environment through apparent loss of function. our results are most consistent with the accumulation of mutations in iron transport genes that were obviated by abundant citrate. the results present another example where a subtle decision in the design of an evolution experiment led to unexpected evolutionary outcomes.
