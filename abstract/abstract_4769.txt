BACKGROUND
hydrogen peroxide  has been known to function as a signalling molecule involved in the modulation of various physiological processes in plants. h2o <dig> has been shown to act as a promoter during adventitious root formation in hypocotyl cuttings. in this study, rna-seq was performed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying h2o2-induced adventitious rooting.


RESULTS
rna-seq data revealed that h2o <dig> treatment greatly increased the numbers of clean reads and expressed genes and abundance of gene expression relative to the water treatment. gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway enrichment analyses indicated that a profound change in gene function occurred in the 6-h h2o <dig> treatment and that h2o <dig> mainly enhanced gene expression levels at the 6-h time point but reduced gene expression levels at the 24-h time point compared with the water treatment. in total,  <dig> differentially expressed  unigenes , of which  <dig> % were up-regulated and  <dig> % were down-regulated;  <dig> degs, of which  <dig> % were up-regulated and  <dig> % were down-regulated; and  <dig> degs, of which  <dig> % were up-regulated and  <dig> % were down-regulated were selected in the 6-h, 24-h, and from 6- to 24-h treatments, respectively. the number of degs in the 6-h treatment was  <dig> % higher than that in the 24-h treatment. the functions of the most highly regulated genes were associated with stress response, cell redox homeostasis and oxidative stress response, cell wall loosening and modification, metabolic processes, and transcription factors , as well as plant hormone signalling, including auxin, ethylene, cytokinin, gibberellin, and abscisic acid pathways. notably, a large number of genes encoding for heat shock proteins  and heat shock transcription factors  were significantly up-regulated during h2o <dig> treatments. furthermore, real-time quantitative pcr  results showed that, during h2o <dig> treatments, the expression levels of arfs, iaas, auxs, nacs, rd <dig>  ahks, mybs, pin <dig>  aux15a, lbd <dig>  lbd <dig>  adh1b, and qorl were significantly up-regulated at the 6- and/or 24-h time points. in contrast, per <dig> and per <dig> were significantly down-regulated by h2o <dig> treatment. these qrt-pcr results strongly correlated with the rna-seq data.


CONCLUSIONS
using rna-seq and qrt-pcr techniques, we analysed the global changes in gene expression and functional profiling during h2o2-induced adventitious rooting in mung bean seedlings. these results strengthen the current understanding of h2o2-induced adventitious rooting and the molecular traits of h2o <dig> priming in plants.
