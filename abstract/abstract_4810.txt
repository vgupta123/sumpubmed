BACKGROUND
cholix toxin is an adp-ribosyltransferase found in non-o1/non-o <dig> strains of vibrio cholera. the catalytic fragment of cholix toxin was characterized as a diphthamide dependent adp-ribosyltransferase.


RESULTS
our studies on the enzymatic activity of cholix toxin catalytic fragment show that the transfer of adp-ribose to toxin takes place by a predominantly intramolecular mechanism and results in the preferential alkylation of arginine residues proximal to the nad+ binding pocket. multiple arginine residues, located near the catalytic site and at distal sites, can be the adp-ribose acceptor in the auto-reaction. kinetic studies of a model enzyme, m <dig>  showed that a diffusible intermediate preferentially reacted with arginine residues in proximity to the nad+ binding pocket. adp-ribosylarginine activity of cholix toxin catalytic fragment could also modify exogenous substrates. auto-adp-ribosylation of cholix toxin appears to have negatively regulatory effect on adp-ribosylation of exogenous substrate. however, at the presence of both endogenous and exogenous substrates, adp-ribosylation of exogenous substrates occurred more efficiently than that of endogenous substrates.


CONCLUSIONS
we discovered an adp-ribosylargininyl activity of cholix toxin catalytic fragment from our studies in auto-adp-ribosylation, which is mediated through diffusible intermediates. the lifetime of the hypothetical intermediate exceeds recorded and predicted lifetimes for the cognate oxocarbenium ion. therefore, a diffusible strained form of nad+ intermediate was proposed to react with arginine residues in a proximity dependent manner.
