BACKGROUND
drought is a major abiotic stress factors that reduces agricultural productivity. gras transcription factors are plant-specific proteins that play diverse roles in plant development. however, the functions of a number of gras genes identified in rice are unknown, especially the gras genes related to rice drought resistance have not been characterized.


RESULTS
in this study, a novel gras transcription factor gene named osgras <dig>  which is located in a drought-resistant qtl interval on chromosome  <dig> of rice, was isolated. the expression of osgras <dig> was induced by drought, nacl, and jasmonic acid treatments. the osgras23-gfp fused protein was localized in the nucleus of tobacco epidermal cells. a trans-activation assay in yeast cells demonstrated that the osgras <dig> protein possessed a strong transcriptional activation activity. osgras23-overexpressing rice plants showed improved drought resistance and oxidative stress tolerance as well as less h2o <dig> accumulation compared with the wild-type plants. furthermore, microarray analysis showed that several anti-oxidation related genes were up-regulated in the osgras23-overexpressing rice plants. the yeast one hybrid test indicated that osgras <dig> could bind to the promoters of its potential target genes.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that osgras <dig> encodes a stress-responsive gras transcription factor and positively modulates rice drought tolerance via the induction of a number of stress-responsive genes.
