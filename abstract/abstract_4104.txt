BACKGROUND
genome-scale metabolic network models have contributed to elucidating biological phenomena, and predicting gene targets to engineer for biotechnological applications. with their increasing importance, their precise network characterization has also been crucial for better understanding of the cellular physiology.


RESULTS
we herein introduce a framework for network modularization and bayesian network analysis  to investigate organismâ€™s metabolism under perturbation. fmb reveals direction of influences among metabolic modules, in which reactions with similar or positively correlated flux variation patterns are clustered, in response to specific perturbation using metabolic flux data. with metabolic flux data calculated by constraints-based flux analysis under both control and perturbation conditions, fmb, in essence, reveals the effects of specific perturbations on the biological system through network modularization and bayesian network analysis at metabolic modular level. as a demonstration, this framework was applied to the genetically perturbed escherichia coli metabolism, which is a lpda gene knockout mutant, using its genome-scale metabolic network model.


CONCLUSIONS
after all, it provides alternative scenarios of metabolic flux distributions in response to the perturbation, which are complementary to the data obtained from conventionally available genome-wide high-throughput techniques or metabolic flux analysis.
