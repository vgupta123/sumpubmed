BACKGROUND
the purpose of this study was to measure the muscular activation in four forelimb muscles while dogs performed agility tasks  and to provide insight into potential relationships between level of muscular activation and risk of injury. muscle activation in eight healthy, client-owned agility dogs was measured using ultrasound-guided fine-wire electromyography of four specific forelimb muscles: biceps brachii, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and triceps brachii – long head, while dogs performed a two jump sequence and while dogs ascended and descended an a-frame obstacle at two different competition heights.


RESULTS
the peak muscle activations during these agility tasks were between  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold greater than walking. jumping required higher levels of muscle activation compared to ascending and descending an a-frame, for all muscles of interest. there was no significant difference in muscle activation between the two a-frame heights.


CONCLUSIONS
compared to walking, all of the muscles were activated at high levels during the agility tasks and our findings indicate that jumping is an especially demanding activity for dogs in agility. this information is broadly relevant to understanding the pathophysiology of forelimb injuries related to canine athletic activity.
