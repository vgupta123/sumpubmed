BACKGROUND
s100a <dig>  a member of the s <dig> family of ca2+-binding proteins, modulates the motility of both non-transformed and cancer cells by regulating the localization and stability of cellular protrusions. biochemical studies have demonstrated that s100a <dig> binds to the c-terminal end of the myosin-iia heavy chain coiled-coil and disassembles myosin-iia filaments; however, the mechanism by which s100a <dig> mediates myosin-iia depolymerization is not well understood.


RESULTS
we determined the x-ray crystal structure of the s100a4Δ8c/miia1908- <dig> peptide complex, which showed an asymmetric binding mode for the myosin-iia peptide across the s100a <dig> dimer interface. this asymmetric binding mode was confirmed in nmr studies using a spin-labeled myosin-iia peptide. in addition, our nmr data indicate that s100a4Δ8c binds the miia1908- <dig> peptide in an orientation very similar to that observed for wild-type s100a <dig>  studies of complex formation using a longer, dimeric myosin-iia construct demonstrated that s100a <dig> binding dissociates the two myosin-iia polypeptide chains to form a complex composed of one s100a <dig> dimer and a single myosin-iia polypeptide chain. this interaction is mediated, in part, by the instability of the region of the myosin-iia coiled-coil encompassing the s100a <dig> binding site.


CONCLUSIONS
the structure of the s100a4/miia1908- <dig> peptide complex has revealed the overall architecture of this assembly and the detailed atomic interactions that mediate s100a <dig> binding to the myosin-iia heavy chain. these structural studies support the idea that residues 1908– <dig> of the myosin-iia heavy chain represent a core sequence for the s100a4/myosin-iia complex. in addition, biophysical studies suggest that structural fluctuations within the myosin-iia coiled-coil may facilitate s100a <dig> docking onto a single myosin-iia polypeptide chain.
