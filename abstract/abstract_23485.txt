BACKGROUND
plasma membrane intrinsic proteins , which belong to aquaporins  superfamily, are subdivided into two groups, pip <dig> and pip <dig>  based on sequence similarity. several pip2s function as water channels, while pip1s have low or no water channel activity, but have a role in water permeability through interacting with pip <dig>  a cold responsive pip <dig> named as mfpip2- <dig> was isolated from medicago falcata , a forage legume with great cold tolerance, and transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing mfpip2- <dig> were analyzed in tolerance to multiple stresses including freezing, chilling, and nitrate reduction in this study.


RESULTS
mfpip2- <dig> transcript was induced by  <dig> to 12 h of cold treatment and 2 h of abscisic acid  treatment. pretreatment with inhibitor of aba synthesis blocked the cold induced mfpip2- <dig> transcript, indicating that aba was involved in cold induced transcription of mfpip2- <dig> in falcata. overexpression of mfpip2- <dig> resulted in enhanced tolerance to freezing, chilling and no3− deficiency in transgenic tobacco  plants as compared with the wild type. moreover, mfpip2- <dig> was demonstrated to facilitate h2o <dig> diffusion in yeast. higher transcript levels of several stress responsive genes, such as nterd10b, nterd10c, ntdreb <dig>  and  <dig>  and nitrate reductase  encoding genes  were observed in transgenic plants as compared with the wild type with dependence upon h2o <dig>  in addition, nr activity was increased in transgenic plants, which led to alterations in free amino acid components and concentrations.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that mfpip2- <dig> plays an important role in plant tolerance to freezing, chilling, and no3− deficiency by promoted h2o <dig> diffusion that in turn up-regulates expression of nias and multiple stress responsive genes.
