BACKGROUND
inflammation following intracerebral hemorrhage  significantly contributes to secondary brain damage and poor outcomes. prostaglandin e <dig>  is known to modulate neuroinflammatory responses and is upregulated in response to brain injury as a result of changes in inducible cyclooxygenase  <dig>  and the membrane-bound type of pge synthase. inhibition of cox- <dig> activity has been reported to attenuate ich-induced brain injury; however, the clinical utility of such drugs is limited due to the potential for severe side effects. therefore, it is now important to search for downstream targets capable of preferentially modulating pge <dig> signaling, and the four e prostanoid receptors, ep1- <dig>  which are the main targets of pge <dig>  remain a viable therapeutic option. we have previously shown that ep <dig> receptor deletion aggravates ich-induced brain injury and impairs functional recovery, thus the current study aimed to elaborate on these results by including a pharmacologic approach targeting the ep <dig> receptor.


RESULTS
chronic post-treatment with the selective ep <dig> receptor antagonist, sc- <dig>  increased lesion volume by  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  and treatment with the ep <dig> agonist, 17-pt-pge <dig>  improved neuromuscular functional recovery on grip strength  and hanging wire  behavioral testing. to begin identifying the mechanisms involved in ep1-mediated neuroprotection after ich, histology was performed to assess ferric iron content, neuroinflammation, leukocyte transendothelial migratory potential, and peripheral neutrophil and immunoglobulin infiltration. following ich, mice treated with the antagonist displayed increased ferric iron  and cortical microgliosis , whereas treatment with the agonist decreased cortical  and striatal  astrogliosis, leukocyte transendothelial migratory potential , neutrophil infiltration , and blood brain barrier breakdown .


CONCLUSIONS
in agreement with our previous results, selective antagonism of the ep <dig> receptor aggravated ich-induced brain injury. furthermore, ep <dig> receptor agonism improved anatomical outcomes and functional recovery. thus, the present data continues to reinforce a putative role for ep <dig> as a new and more selective therapeutic target for the treatment of ich that could reduce the side effects associated with cox- <dig> inhibition while still exploiting the beneficial effects.
