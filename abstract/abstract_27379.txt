BACKGROUND
two stages of genome activation have been identified in the mouse embryo. specifically, minor transcriptional activation is evident at the one-cell stage and a second major episode of activation occurs at the two-cell stage. nuclear translocation of rna polymerase ii and phosphorylation of the c-terminal domain  of the largest enzyme subunit are major determinants of embryonic genome activation. p-tefb, the pol ii ctd kinase, regulates transcriptional elongation via phosphorylation of the serine  <dig> residues of the ctd.


RESULTS
here, we show that the cdk <dig> and cyclin t <dig> subunits of p-tefb are present in mouse oocytes and preimplantation embryos. both proteins translocate to pronuclei at the late one-cell stage and are predominantly localized in nuclei at the two-cell stage. we additionally examine the effects of the cdk9-specific inhibitor, flavopiridol, on mouse preimplantation development. our data show that treatment with the drug results in mislocalization of cdk <dig>  cyclin t <dig>  and phosphorylated pol ii, as well as developmental arrest at the two-cell stage.


CONCLUSIONS
a change in cdk <dig> localization from the cytoplasm to the pronucleus occurs at the time of minor embryonic genome activation, and cdk <dig> accumulation at the two-cell stage is evident, concomitant with major transcriptional activation of the embryonic genome. moreover, cdk <dig> inhibition triggers a developmental block at the two-cell stage. our findings clearly indicate that cdk <dig> is essential for embryonic genome activation in the mouse.
