BACKGROUND
the tissue-signaling cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig> are critical to host defense against oral candida albicans infection, by their induction of oral antimicrobial peptide expression and recruitment of neutrophils. mucosal th <dig> cells which produce these cytokines are preferentially depleted in hiv-infected patients. here, we tested the hypothesis that defective il-17- and il-22-dependent host responses to c. albicans determine the phenotype of susceptibility to oropharyngeal candidiasis  in transgenic  mice expressing hiv- <dig> 


RESULTS
naïve cd4+ t-cells and the differentiated th <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig>  th1th <dig> and treg lineages were all profoundly depleted in cervical lymph nodes  of these tg mice. however, naive cd4+ cells from tg mice maintained the capacity to differentiate into these lineages in response to polarizing cytokines in vitro. expression of il <dig>  il <dig>  s100a <dig> and ccl <dig> was enhanced in oral mucosal tissue of non-tg, but not of tg mice, after oral infection with c. albicans. treatment of infected tg mice with the combination of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  but not il- <dig> or il- <dig> alone, significantly reduced oral burdens of c. albicans and abundance of candida hyphae in the epithelium of tongues of infected tg mice, and restored the ability of the tg mice to up-regulate expression of s100a <dig> and ccl <dig> in response to c. albicans infection.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings demonstrate that defective il-17- and il-22-dependent induction of innate mucosal immunity to c. albicans is central to the phenotype of susceptibility to opc in these hiv transgenic mice.
