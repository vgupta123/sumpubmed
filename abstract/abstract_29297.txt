BACKGROUND
human cell lines are the most innovative choice of host cell for production of biopharmaceuticals since they allow for authentic posttranslational modification of therapeutic proteins. we present a new method for generating high and stable protein expressing cell lines based on human amniocytes without the requirement of antibiotic selection.


RESULTS
primary amniocytes from routine amniocentesis samples can be efficiently transformed with adenoviral functions resulting in stable human cell lines. cotransfection of the primary human amniocytes with a plasmid expressing adenoviral e <dig> functions plus a second plasmid containing a gene of interest resulted in permanent cell lines expressing up to  <dig> pg/cell/day of a fully glycosylated and sialylated protein. expression of the gene of interest is very stable for more than  <dig> passages and, importantly, was achieved in the absence of any antibiotic selection.


CONCLUSIONS
we describe an improved method for developing high protein expressing stable human cell lines. these cell lines are of non-tumor origin, they are immortalized by a function not oncogenic in human and they are from an ethically accepted and easily accessible cell source. since the cell can be easily adapted to growth in serum-free and chemically defined medium they fulfill the requirements of biopharmaceutical production processes.
