BACKGROUND
accumulating evidence has demonstrated that over-expression of neuroglobin  is neuroprotective against hypoxic/ischemic brain injuries. in this study we tested the neuroprotective effects of ngb over-expression against traumatic brain injury  in mice.


RESULTS
both ngb over-expression transgenic  and wild-type  control mice were subjected to tbi induced by a controlled cortical impact  device. tbi significantly increased ngb expression in the brains of both wt and ngb-tg mice, but ngb-tg mice had significantly higher ngb protein levels at the pre-injury baseline and post-tbi. production of oxidative tissue damage biomarker 3nt in the brain was significantly reduced in ngb-tg mice compared to wt controls at  <dig> hours after tbi. the traumatic brain lesion volume was significantly reduced in ngb tg mice compared to wt mice at  <dig> weeks after tbi; however, there were no significant differences in the recovery of sensorimotor and spatial memory functional deficits between ngb-tg and wt control mice for up to  <dig> weeks after tbi.


CONCLUSIONS
ngb over-expression reduced traumatic lesion volume, which might partially be achieved by decreasing oxidative stress.
