BACKGROUND
bacterial lipoproteins often play important roles in pathogenesis and can stimulate protective immune responses. such lipoproteins are viable vaccine candidates. haemophilus ducreyi, which causes the sexually transmitted disease chancroid, expresses a number of lipoproteins during human infection. one such lipoprotein, ompp <dig>  is homologous to the outer membrane lipoprotein e  of h. influenzae. in h. influenzae, e  stimulates production of bactericidal and protective antibodies and contributes to pathogenesis by facilitating acquisition of the essential nutrients heme and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide . here, we tested the hypothesis that, like its homolog, h. ducreyi ompp <dig> contributes to virulence and stimulates production of bactericidal antibodies.


RESULTS
we determined that ompp <dig> is broadly conserved among clinical isolates of h. ducreyi. we next constructed and characterized an isogenic ompp <dig> mutant, designated 35000hpompp <dig>  in h. ducreyi strain 35000hp. to test whether ompp <dig> was necessary for virulence in humans, eight healthy adults were experimentally infected. each subject was inoculated with a fixed dose of 35000hp on one arm and three doses of 35000hpompp <dig> on the other arm. the overall parent and mutant pustule formation rates were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . these results indicate that expression of ompp <dig> in not necessary for h. ducreyi to initiate disease or progress to pustule formation in humans. hyperimmune mouse serum raised against purified, recombinant ompp <dig> did not promote bactericidal killing of 35000hp or phagocytosis by j774a. <dig> mouse macrophages in serum bactericidal and phagocytosis assays, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that, unlike e , h. ducreyi ompp <dig> is not a suitable vaccine candidate. ompp <dig> may be dispensable for virulence because of redundant mechanisms in h. ducreyi for heme acquisition and nad utilization.
