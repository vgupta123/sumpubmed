BACKGROUND
the nematode caenorhabditis elegans was the first multicellular organism to have its genome fully sequenced. over the last  <dig> years since the original publication in  <dig>  the c. elegans genome has been scrutinized and the last gaps were filled in november  <dig>  which present a unique opportunity for examining genome-wide segmental duplications.


RESULTS
here, we performed analysis of the c. elegans genome in search for segmental duplications using a new tool–orthocluster–we have recently developed. we detected  <dig>  duplicated segments–duplicons–ranging in size from  <dig> bp to  <dig> kb. the largest pair of duplicons,  <dig> kb in length located on the left arm of chromosome v, was further characterized. they are nearly identical at the dna level  and each duplicon contains  <dig> putative protein coding genes. genotyping of  <dig> wild-type strains obtained from different labs in the c. elegans community revealed that not all strains contain this duplication. in fact, only  <dig> strains carry this large segmental duplication, suggesting a very recent duplication event in the c. elegans genome.


CONCLUSIONS
this report represents the first demonstration that the c. elegans laboratory wild-type n <dig> strains has acquired large-scale differences.
