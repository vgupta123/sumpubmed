BACKGROUND
sugarcane distilleries use molasses for ethanol production and generate large volume of effluent containing high biological oxygen demand  and chemical oxygen demand  along with melanoidin pigment. melanoidin is a recalcitrant compound that causes several toxic effects on living system, therefore, may be treated before disposal. the aim of this study was to isolate a potential thermotolerant melanoidin decolorizing yeast from natural resources, and optimized different physico-chemical and nutritional parameters.


RESULTS
total  <dig> yeasts were isolated from the soil samples of near by distillery site, in which isolate y- <dig> showed maximum decolorization and identified as candida tropicalis by microbial type culture collection  chandigarh, india. the decolorization yield was expressed as the decrease in the absorbance at 475 nm against initial absorbance at the same wavelength. uninoculated medium served as control. yeast showed maximum decolorization  at 45°c using  <dig> %, glucose;  <dig> %, peptone;  <dig> %, mgso4;  <dig> %, kh2po4; ph- <dig>  within 24 h of incubation under static condition. decolorizing ability of yeast was also confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography  analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
the yeast strain efficiently decolorized melanoidin pigment of distillery effluent at higher temperature than the other earlier reported strains of yeast, therefore, this strain could also be used at industrial level for melanoidin decolorization as it tolerated a wide range of temperature and ph with very small amount of carbon and nitrogen sources.
