BACKGROUND
single-stranded dna-binding proteins are essential cellular components required for the protection, metabolism and processing of single-stranded dna. human single-stranded dna-binding protein  <dig>  is one such protein, with described roles in genome stability maintenance and transcriptional regulation. as yet, however, the mechanisms through which hssb <dig> functions and the binding partners with which it interacts remain poorly understood.


RESULTS
in this work, hssb <dig> was immunoprecipitated from cell lysate samples that had been enriched for non-soluble nuclear proteins and those associating with hssb <dig> identified by mass spectrometry. in doing so,  <dig> potential hssb1-associating proteins were identified, with known roles in a range of distinct biological processes. unexpectedly, whilst hssb <dig> has largely been studied in a genome stability context, few other dna repair or replication proteins were detected. by contrast, a large number of proteins were identified with roles in mrna metabolism, reflecting a currently emerging area of hssb <dig> study. in addition, numerous proteins were detected that comprise various chromatin-remodelling complexes.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings provide new insight into the binding partners of hssb <dig> and will likely function as a platform for future research.
