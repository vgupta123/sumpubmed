BACKGROUND
the senegalese sole  is a marine flatfish of increasing commercial interest. however, the reproduction of this species in captivity is not yet controlled mainly because of the poor knowledge on its reproductive physiology, as it occurs for other non-salmonid marine teleosts that exhibit group-synchronous ovarian follicle development. in order to investigate intra-ovarian molecular mechanisms in senegalese sole, the aim of the present study was to identify differentially expressed genes in the ovary during oocyte growth , maturation and ovarian follicle atresia using a recently developed oligonucleotide microarray.


RESULTS
microarray analysis led to the identification of  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts, of which  <dig> and  <dig> were monitored by real-time pcr and in situ hybridization, respectively. during vitellogenesis, many up-regulated ovarian transcripts had putative mitochondrial function/location suggesting high energy production  and increased antioxidant protection , whereas other regulated transcripts were related to cytoskeleton and zona radiata organization , intracellular signalling pathways , cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions , and the maternal rna pool . transcripts up-regulated in the ovary during oocyte maturation included ion transporters , probably required for oocyte hydration, as well as a proteinase inhibitor  and a vesicle calcium sensor protein . during follicular atresia, few transcripts were found to be up-regulated, but remarkably most of them were localized in follicular cells of atretic follicles, and they had inferred roles in lipid transport , chemotaxis , angiogenesis , and prevention of apoptosis .


CONCLUSIONS
this study has identified a number of differentially expressed genes in the ovary that were not previously found to be regulated during ovarian development in marine fish. specifically, we found evidence, for the first time in teleosts, of the activation of chemoattractant, angiogenic and antiapoptotic pathways in hypertrophied follicular cells at the onset of ovarian atresia.
