BACKGROUND
genes encoding extended spectrum beta lactamases are usually located on transferable plasmids. each plasmid contains its own replication mechanism. carattoli et al. developed an extended pcr-based replicon typing method to characterize and identify the replicons of the major plasmid incompatibility groups in enterobacteriaceae. based on this method, we designed a rapid approach with amplicon detection by real-time melting curve analysis. this method appeared to be fast, sensitive, less laborious, less prone to contamination and applicable in a routine laboratory environment.


RESULTS
we successfully integrated the post-pcr analysis of the replicon typing into a closed system, which leads to a 10-fold increase in sensitivity compared to agarose gel visualization. moreover, the use of crude lysates and sybr-green saves a considerable amount of hands-on time without decreasing the sensitivity or specificity.


CONCLUSIONS
this real-time melting curve replicon typing method appears to be fast, sensitive, less laborious, less prone to contamination and applicable in a routine laboratory environment.
