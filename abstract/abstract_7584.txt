BACKGROUND
micrornas  are about  <dig> nucleotides, non-coding rnas that affect various cellular functions, and play a regulatory role in different organisms including human. until now, more than  <dig> mature mirnas in human have been discovered and registered, but still lack of information or algorithms to reveal the relations among mirnas, environmental chemicals and human health. chemicals in environment affect our health and daily life, and some of them can lead to diseases by inferring biological pathways.


RESULTS
we develop a creditable online web server, chemirs, for predicting interactions and relations among mirnas, chemicals and pathways. the database not only compares gene lists affected by chemicals and mirnas, but also incorporates curated pathways to identify possible interactions.


CONCLUSIONS
here, we manually retrieved associations of mirnas and chemicals from biomedical literature. we developed an online system, chemirs, which contains mirnas, diseases, medical subject heading  terms, chemicals, genes, pathways and pubmed ids. we connected each mirna to mirbase, and every current gene symbol to hugo gene nomenclature committee  for genome annotation. human pathway information is also provided from kegg and reactome databases. information about gene ontology  is queried from go online sql environment . with a user-friendly interface, the web application is easy to use. multiple query results can be easily integrated and exported as report documents in pdf format. association analysis of mirnas and chemicals can help us understand the pathogenesis of chemical components. chemirs is freely available for public use at http://omics.biol.ntnu.edu.tw/chemirs.
