BACKGROUND
the application of vaccine adjuvants has been vigorously studied for a diverse range of diseases in order to improve immune responses and reduce toxicity. however, most adjuvants have limited uses in clinical practice due to their toxicity.

methods
therefore, to reduce health risks associated with the use of such adjuvants, we developed an advanced non-toxic adjuvant utilizing biodegradable chitosan hydrogel  containing ovalbumin  and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor  as a local antigen delivery system.


RESULTS
after subcutaneous injection into mice, ova/gm-csf-loaded ch-hg demonstrated improved safety and enhanced ova-specific antibody production compared to oil-based adjuvants such as complete freund’s adjuvant  or incomplete freund’s adjuvant . moreover, ch-hg system-mediated immune responses was characterized by increased number of ova-specific cd4+ and cd8+ inf-γ+ t cells, leading to enhanced humoral and cellular immunity.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, the improved safety and enhanced immune response characteristics of our novel adjuvant system suggest the possibility of the extended use of adjuvants in clinical practice with reduced apprehension about toxic side effects.
