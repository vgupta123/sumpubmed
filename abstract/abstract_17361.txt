BACKGROUND
deacetylation of histones plays a fundamental role in gene silencing, and this is mediated by a corepressor complex containing sin <dig> as an essential scaffold protein. in this report we examine the evolution of two proteins in this complex, the sin3-associated proteins sap30l and sap <dig>  by using an archive of protein sequences from  <dig> species.


RESULTS
our analysis indicates that in tetrapods sap30l is more similar than sap <dig> to the ancestral protein, and the two copies in this group originated by gene duplication which occurred after the divergence of actinopterygii and sarcopterygii about  <dig> million years ago . the phylogenetic analysis and biochemical experiments suggest that sap <dig> has diverged functionally from the ancestral sap30l by accumulating mutations that have caused attenuation of one of the original functions, association with the nuclear matrix. this function is mediated by a nuclear matrix association sequence, which consists of a conserved motif in the c-terminus and the adjacent nucleolar localization signal .


CONCLUSIONS
these results add further insight into the evolution and function of proteins of the sap <dig> family, which share many characteristic with nuclear scaffolding proteins that are intimately involved in regulation of gene expression. furthermore, sap30l seems essential to eukaryotic biology, as it is found in animals, plants, fungi, as well as some taxa of unicellular eukaryotes.
