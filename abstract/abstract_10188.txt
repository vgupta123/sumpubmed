BACKGROUND
the insertion element is <dig> found in aeromonas salmonicida belongs to the is630-tc1-mariner superfamily of transposons. it is present in multiple copies and represents approximately half of the is present in the genome of a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida a <dig> 


RESULTS
by using high copy number is <dig> restriction fragment length polymorphism , strains of various subspecies of aeromonas salmonicida showed conserved or clustering patterns, thus allowing their differentiation from each other. fingerprints of a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida showed the highest homogeneity while ‘atypical’ a. salmonicida strains were more heterogeneous. is <dig> typing also differentiated a. salmonicida from other aeromonas species. the copy number of is <dig> in aeromonas salmonicida ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> and is much lower in other aeromonas species.


CONCLUSIONS
hcn-is630-rflp is a powerful tool for subtyping of a. salmonicida. the high stability of is <dig> insertions in a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida indicates that it might have played a role in pathoadaptation of a. salmonicida which has reached an optimal configuration in the highly virulent and specific fish pathogen a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.
