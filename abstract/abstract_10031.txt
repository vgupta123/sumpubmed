BACKGROUND
the serine-threonine protein kinase gene, designated pkv  was previously found to be transcriptionally activated in tomato plants infected with the plant pathogen potato spindle tuber viroid . these plants exhibited symptoms of stunting, and abnormal development of leaf, root, and vascular tissues. the encoded protein, pkv, is a novel member of the agc viiia group of signal-transducing protein kinases; however, the role of pkv in plant development is unknown. in this communication, we report the phenotypic results of over expression and silencing of pkv in transgenic tobacco.


RESULTS
over expression of pkv in nicotiana tabacum cv. xanthi  resulted in stunting, reduced root formation, and delay in flowering, phenotypes similar to symptoms of pstvd infection of tomato. in addition, homozygous t <dig> tobacco plants over expressing pkv were male sterile. antisense expression of pkv, on the other hand, resulted in plants that were taller than non-transformed plants, produced an increased number of flowers, and were fertile. exogenous application of ga <dig> stimulated stem elongation in the stunted, sense-expressing plants. pkv sense and antisense expression altered transcript levels of ga biosynthetic genes and genes involved in developmental and signaling pathways, but not genes involved in salicylic acid- or jasmonic acid-dependent pathways. our data provide evidence suggesting that pkv plays an important role in a ga signaling pathway that controls plant height and fertility.


CONCLUSIONS
we have found that the over expression of the tomato protein kinase pkv resulted in stunting, modified vascular tissue development, reduced root formation, and male sterility in tobacco, and we propose that pkv regulates plant development by functioning in critical signaling pathways involved in gibberellic acid metabolism.
