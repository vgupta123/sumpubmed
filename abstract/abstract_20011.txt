BACKGROUND
laribacter hongkongensis is a newly discovered, facultative anaerobic, gram-negative, motile, sea gull-shaped rod associated with freshwater fish borne gastroenteritis and traveler's diarrhea. a highly reproducible and discriminative typing system is essential for better understanding of the epidemiology of l. hongkongensis. in this study, a multilocus sequence typing  system was developed for l. hongkongensis. the system was used to characterize  <dig> l. hongkongensis isolates, including  <dig> from humans and  <dig> from fish.


RESULTS
fragments  of seven housekeeping genes were amplified and sequenced. among the  <dig> bp of the seven loci,  <dig> polymorphic sites were observed. the median number of alleles at each locus was  <dig> . all seven genes showed very low dn/ds ratios of <  <dig> , indicating that no strong positive selective pressure is present. a total of  <dig> different sequence types  were assigned to the  <dig> isolates, with  <dig> sts identified only once. the overall discriminatory power was  <dig> . eburst grouped the isolates into  <dig> lineages, with six groups containing only isolates from fish and three groups only isolates from humans. standardized index of association  measurement showed significant linkage disequilibrium in isolates from both humans and fish. the isa for the isolates from humans and fish were  <dig>  and  <dig> , indicating the isolates from fish were more clonal than the isolates from humans. only one interconnected network  was detected in the split graphs. the p-value  of sum of the squares of condensed fragments in sawyer's test showed evidence of intragenic recombination in the rho, acnb and thic loci, but the p-value  of maximum condensed fragment in these gene loci did not show evidence of intragenic recombination. congruence analysis showed that all the pairwise comparisons of the  <dig> mlst loci were incongruent, indicating that recombination played a substantial role in the evolution of l. hongkongensis. a website for l. hongkongensis mlst was set up and can be accessed at http://mlstdb.hku.hk:14206/mlst_index.html.


CONCLUSIONS
a highly reproducible and discriminative mlst system was developed for l. hongkongensis.
