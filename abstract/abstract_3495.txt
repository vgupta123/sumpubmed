BACKGROUND
the mitochondrial genome from upland cotton, g. hirsutum, was previously sequenced. to elucidate the evolution of mitochondrial genomic diversity within a single genus, we sequenced the mitochondrial genome from sea island cotton .

methods
mitochondrial dna from week-old etiolated seedlings was extracted from isolated organelles using discontinuous sucrose density gradient method. mitochondrial genome was sequenced with solexa using paired-end,  <dig> bp read. the clean reads were assembled into contigs using abyss and finished via additional fosmid and bac sequencing. finally, the genome was annotated and analyzed using different softwares.


RESULTS
the g. barbadense  mitochondrial genome was fully sequenced  and compared to the mitogenome of upland cotton. the g. barbadense mitochondrial dna contains seven more genes than that of upland cotton, with a total of  <dig> protein coding genes ,  <dig> rrna genes, and  <dig> trna genes. of these  <dig> genes, atp <dig>  mttb, nad <dig>  nad <dig>  rrn <dig>  rrn <dig>  and trnd-cp were each represented by two identical copies. a single 64 kb repeat was largely responsible for the 9 % difference in genome size between the two mtdnas. comparison of genome structures between the two mitochondrial genomes revealed  <dig> rearranged syntenic regions and several large repeats. the largest repeat was missing from the master chromosome in g. hirsutum. both mitochondrial genomes contain a duplicated copy of rps <dig>  in conjunction with a duplication of repeated sequences. phylogenetic and divergence considerations suggest that a 544-bp fragment of rps <dig> was transferred to the nuclear genome shortly after divergence of the a- and d- genome diploid cottons.


CONCLUSIONS
these results highlight the insights to the evolution of structural variation between sea island and upland cotton mitochondrial genomes.
