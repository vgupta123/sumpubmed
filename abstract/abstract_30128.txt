BACKGROUND
atsuc <dig>  from arabidopsis thaliana encodes a phloem-localized sucrose/proton symporter required for efficient photoassimilate transport from source tissues to sink tissues. atsuc <dig> plays a key role in coordinating the demands of sink tissues with the output capacity of source leaves, and in maintaining phloem hydrostatic pressure during changes in plant-water balance. expression and activity are regulated, both positively and negatively, by developmental  and environmental cues, including light, diurnal changes, photoassimilate levels, turgor pressure, drought and osmotic stress, and hormones.


RESULTS
to assess the importance of this regulation to whole-plant growth and carbon partitioning, atsuc <dig> cdna was expressed from two exotic, phloem-specific promoters in a mutant background debilitated for atsuc <dig> function. the first was a promoter element from commelina yellow mottle virus , and the second was the rolc promoter from agrobacterium rhizogenes. coymvp::atsuc <dig> cdna restored growth and carbon partitioning to near wild-type levels, whereas plants harboring rolcp::atsuc <dig> cdna showed only partial complementation.


CONCLUSIONS
expressing atsuc <dig> cdna from exotic, phloem-specific promoters argues that strong, phloem-localized expression is sufficient for efficient transport. expressing atsuc <dig> from promoters that foster efficient phloem transport but are subject to regulatory cascades different from the endogenous sucrose/proton symporter genes has implications for biotechnology.
