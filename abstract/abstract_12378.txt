BACKGROUND
the haplotype phasing problem tries to screen for phenotype associated genomic variations from millions of candidate data. most of the current computer programs handle this problem with high requirements of computing power and memory. by replacing the computation-intensive step of constructing the maximum spanning tree with a heuristics of estimated initial haplotype, we released the winhap algorithm version  <dig> , which outperforms the other algorithms in terms of both running speed and overall accuracy.


RESULTS
this work further speeds up the winhap algorithm to version  <dig>   by utilizing the divide-and-conquer strategy and the openmp parallel computing mode. winhap <dig> can phase  <dig> genotypes with  <dig> , <dig> snps using just  <dig>  mb in memory and  <dig>  hours on a personal computer, whereas the other programs require unacceptable memory or running times. the parallel running mode further improves winhap2's running speed with several orders of magnitudes, compared with the other programs, including beagle, shapeit <dig> and 2snp.


CONCLUSIONS
winhap <dig> is an extremely fast haplotype phasing program which can handle a large-scale genotyping study with any number of snps in the current literature and at least in the near future.
