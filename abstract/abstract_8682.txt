BACKGROUND
phenethylisothiocyanate  is produced by brassica food plants. peo is a peitc essential oil containing >95% natural peitc. peitc is known to produce various health benefits but its effect in alleviation of ulcerative colitis signs is unknown.


RESULTS
in two efficacy studies  oral administration of peo was effective at remitting acute and chronic signs of ulcerative colitis  in mice. disease activity, histology and biochemical characteristics were measured in the treated animals and were compared with appropriate controls. peo treatment significantly improved body weights and stool consistency as well as decreased intestinal bleeding. peo treatment also reduced mucosal inflammation, depletion of goblet cells and infiltration of inflammatory cells. attenuation of proinflammatory interleukin1Î² production was observed in the colons of peo-treated animals. expression analyses were also carried out for immune function related genes, transcription factors and cytokines in lipopolysaccharide-activated mouse macrophage cells. peo likely affects an intricate network of immune signaling genes including a novel concentration dependent reduction of total cellular signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  as well as nuclear phosphorylated-stat <dig> . a peo-concentration dependent decrease of mrna of c-x-c motif ligand  <dig>  and interleukin  <dig> were also observed.


CONCLUSIONS
peo might be a promising candidate to develop as a treatment for ulcerative colitis patients. the disease attenuation by peo is likely associated with suppression of activation of stat <dig> transcription and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
