BACKGROUND
accumulation of visceral adipose tissue  is clearly associated with an increased risk of obesity-related diseases and all-cause mortality, whereas gluteal subcutaneous fat accumulation  is associated with a lower risk. the relative contribution, in term of cardiovascular risk, of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue  is still controversial with studies showing both a detrimental effect and a protective role.

animal and in vitro studies demonstrated that adipocytes from visceral and subcutaneous depots have distinct morphological, metabolic and functional characteristics. these regional differences have a key role in the pathogenesis of obesity-related diseases. there is recent evidence that differentiation between upper-body and lower-body adipose tissues might be under control of site-specific sets of developmental genes, such as homebox  genes, a group of related genes that control the body plan of an embryo along the anterior-posterior axis. however, the possible heterogeneity between different subcutaneous regions has not been extensively investigated.

here we studied global mrna expression in g-sat and a-sat with a microarray approach. rna was isolated from g-sat and a-sat biopsy, from eight healthy subjects, and hybridized on rna microarray chips in order to detect regional differences in gene expression.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> genes are significantly and differently  expressed in a-sat and g-sat. expression profiling reveals significant differences in expression of several hox genes. interestingly, two molecular signature of visceral adipocyte lineage, homebox genes hoxa <dig> and nr2f <dig>  are up-regulated in a-sat versus g-sat by a  <dig>  fold change.


CONCLUSIONS
our study shows that g-sat and a-sat have distinct expression profiles. the finding of a different expression of hox genes, fundamental during the embryo development, suggests an early regional differentiation of subcutaneous adipose depots. moreover, the higher expression of hoxa <dig> and nr2f <dig>  two molecular signatures of visceral adipocytes, in a-sat suggests that this subcutaneous adipose depot could be more similar to vat than g-sat.

our data suggest that we should look at sat as composed of distinct depots with possibly different impact in obesity associated metabolic complications.
