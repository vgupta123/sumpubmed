BACKGROUND
the α-isoform of the type 1a phosphoinositide 3-kinases  has protein kinase activity as well as phosphoinositide lipid kinase activity. the best described substrate for its protein kinase activity is its regulatory subunit, p85α, which becomes phosphorylated on serine  <dig>  phosphorylation of serine  <dig> has been reported to down-regulate its lipid kinase activity.


RESULTS
we have assessed whether oncogenic mutants of pi3kα, which have up-regulated lipid kinase activity, have altered levels of serine  <dig> phosphorylation compared to wild type pi3kα, and whether differential phosphorylation of serine  <dig> contributes to increased activity of oncogenic forms of pi3kα with point mutations in the helical or the kinase domains. despite markedly increased lipid kinase activity, protein kinase activity was not altered in oncogenic compared to wild type forms of pi3kα. by manipulating levels of phosphorylation of serine  <dig> in vitro, we found no evidence that the protein kinase activity of pi3kα affects its phosphoinositide lipid kinase activity in either wild-type or oncogenic mutants of pi3kα.


CONCLUSIONS
phosphorylation of p85α s <dig> is not a significant regulator of wild-type or oncogenic pi3kα lipid kinase activity.
