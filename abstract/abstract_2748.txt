BACKGROUND
desmoglein  <dig>  is the target protein in the skin disease exudative epidermitis in pigs caused by virulent strains of staphylococcus hyicus. the exfoliative toxins produced by s. hyicus digest the porcine desmoglein  <dig> dsg <dig> by a very specific reaction. this study investigated the location of single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the porcine desmoglein  <dig> gene dsg <dig> in correlation to the cleavage site as well as if the genotype of the snps is correlated to susceptibility or resistance to the disease.


RESULTS
dna from  <dig> affected and  <dig> unaffected piglets with exudative epidermitis were diagnosed clinically as affected or unaffected. two regions of the desmoglein  <dig> gene were sequenced and genotypes of the snps were established. seven snps  were found in the analysed sequences and the allele frequencies were determined for the snps resulting in amino acid change. four of the seven polymorphisms were situated in the motif known to be important for toxin cleavage. the distribution of the genotypes between affected and unaffected animals was analysed.


CONCLUSIONS
the study indicated a possible correlation between the genotypes of two out of seven snps found in the porcine desmoglein  <dig> gene and the susceptibility to exudative epidermitis.
