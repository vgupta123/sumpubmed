BACKGROUND
yersinia pestis, the aetiological agent of plague, has been well defined genotypically on local and worldwide scales. in november  <dig>  five cases of severe pneumonia of unknown causes, resulting in two deaths, were reported in yulong, yunnan province. in this study, we compared y. pestis isolated from the yulong focus to strains from other areas.


RESULTS
two hundred and thirteen y. pestis strains collected from different plague foci in china and a live attenuated vaccine strain of y. pestis  were genotyped using multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis  on  <dig> loci. a total of  <dig> y. pestis strains were divided into  <dig> mlva types, and nei's genetic diversity indices of the various loci ranged between  <dig>  -  <dig> . minimum spanning tree analysis showed that y. pestis in china could be divided into six complexes. it was observed that microtus strains were different from the other three biovar strains. each plague focus had its own unique mlva types.


CONCLUSIONS
the strains isolated from yulong, yunnan province had a unique mlva type, indicating a new clone group. our results suggest that yulong strains may have a close relationship with strains from the qinghai-tibet plateau plague focus.
