BACKGROUND
in addition to genome sequencing, accurate functional annotation of genomes is required in order to carry out comparative and evolutionary analyses between species. among primates, the human genome is the most extensively annotated. human mirna gene annotation is based on multiple lines of evidence including evidence for expression as well as prediction of the characteristic hairpin structure. in contrast, most mirna genes in non-human primates are annotated based on homology without any expression evidence. we have sequenced small-rna libraries from chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan and rhesus macaque from multiple individuals and tissues. using patterns of mirna expression in conjunction with a model of mirna biogenesis we used these high-throughput sequencing data to identify novel mirnas in non-human primates.


RESULTS
we predicted  <dig> new mirnas in chimpanzee,  <dig> in gorilla,  <dig> in orangutan and  <dig> in rhesus macaque. the algorithm we used was able to predict 64% of the previously known mirnas in chimpanzee, 94% in gorilla, 61% in orangutan and 71% in rhesus macaque. we therefore added evidence for expression in between one and five tissues to mirnas that were previously annotated based only on homology to human mirnas. we increased from  <dig> to  <dig> the number mirnas that are located in orthologous regions in humans and the four non-human primate species studied here.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study we provide expression evidence for homology-based annotated mirnas and predict de novo mirnas in four non-human primate species. we increased the number of annotated mirna genes and provided evidence for their expression in four non-human primates. similar approaches using different individuals and tissues would improve annotation in non-human primates and allow for further comparative studies in the future.
