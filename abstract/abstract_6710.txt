BACKGROUND
we assessed the potential of multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis , pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , and antimicrobial susceptibility testing for discriminating  <dig> sporadic and outbreak-related yersinia enterocolitica  bio/serotype 3-4/o: <dig> and 2/o: <dig> isolates. mlva using six vntr markers was performed in two separate multiplex pcrs, and the fluorescently labeled pcr products were accurately sized on an automated dna sequencer.


RESULTS
mlva discriminated  <dig> sporadic ye 3-4/o: <dig> and 2/o: <dig> strains into  <dig> types, whereas pfge with the restriction enzyme noti discriminated the strains into  <dig> different pfge pulsotypes. the discriminatory index for a sporadic strain was  <dig>  for pfge and  <dig>  for mlva. mlva confirmed that a foodborne outbreak in the city of kotka, finland in  <dig> had been caused by a multiresistant ye 4/o: <dig> strain that was distinctly different from those of epidemiologically unrelated strains with an identical pfge pulsotype. the multiresistance of y. enterocolitica strains  correlated significantly  with travel abroad. all of the multiresistant y. enterocolitica strains belonged to four pfge pulsotypes that did not contain any susceptible strains. resistance to nalidixic acid was related to changes in codons  <dig> or  <dig> that stemmed from mutations in the gyra gene. the conjugation experiments demonstrated that resistance to chl, str, and sul was carried by a conjugative plasmid.


CONCLUSIONS
mlva using six loci had better discriminatory power than pfge with the noti enzyme. mlva was also a less labor-intensive method than pfge and the results were easier to analyze. the conjugation experiments demonstrated that a resistance plasmid can easily be transferred between y. enterocolitica strains. antimicrobial multiresistance of y. enterocolitica strains was significantly associated with travel abroad.
