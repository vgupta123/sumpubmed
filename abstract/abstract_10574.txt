BACKGROUND
a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms  have been identified in common carp  but, as yet, no high-throughput genotyping platform is available for this species. c. carpio is an important aquaculture species that accounts for nearly 14% of freshwater aquaculture production worldwide. we have developed an array for c. carpio with  <dig>  snps and evaluated its performance using samples from various strains of c. carpio.


RESULTS
the snps used on the array were selected from two resources: the transcribed sequences from rna-seq data of four strains of c. carpio, and the genome re-sequencing data of five strains of c. carpio. the  <dig>  snps on the resulting array are distributed evenly across the reference c.carpio genome with an average spacing of  <dig> Â kb. to evaluate the snp array,  <dig>  c. carpio samples were collected and tested. of the  <dig>  snps on the array,  <dig>   were found to be polymorphic sites. genotyping accuracy was checked using genotyping data from a group of full-siblings and their parents, and over  <dig> % of the qualified snps were found to be reliable. analysis of the linkage disequilibrium on all samples and on three domestic c.carpio strains revealed that the latter had the longer haplotype blocks. we also evaluated our snp array on  <dig> samples from eight species related to c. carpio, with from  <dig>  to  <dig>  polymorphic snps. an identity by state analysis divided all the samples into three clusters; most of the c. carpio strains formed the largest cluster.


CONCLUSIONS
the carp snp array described here is the first high-throughput genotyping platform for c. carpio. our evaluation of this array indicates that it will be valuable for farmed carp and for genetic and population biology studies in c. carpio and related species.
