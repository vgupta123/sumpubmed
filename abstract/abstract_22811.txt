BACKGROUND
coxiella burnetii is the causative agent of q-fever, a widespread zoonosis. due to its high environmental stability and infectivity it is regarded as a category b biological weapon agent. in domestic animals infection remains either asymptomatic or presents as infertility or abortion. clinical presentation in humans can range from mild flu-like illness to acute pneumonia and hepatitis. endocarditis represents the most common form of chronic q-fever. in humans serology is the gold standard for diagnosis but is inadequate for early case detection. in order to serve as a diagnostic tool in an eventual biological weapon attack or in local epidemics we developed a real-time 5'nuclease based pcr assay with an internal control system. to facilitate high-throughput an automated extraction procedure was evaluated.


RESULTS
to determine the minimum number of copies that are detectable at 95% chance probit analysis was used. limit of detection in blood was  <dig>  copies/ml  with a manual extraction procedure and  <dig>  copies/ml  with a fully automated extraction procedure, respectively. to demonstrate clinical application a total of  <dig> specimens of animal origin were compared with respect to manual and automated extraction. a strong correlation between both methods was observed rendering both methods suitable. testing of  <dig> follow up specimens of animal origin from a local q-fever epidemic rendered real-time pcr more sensitive than conventional pcr.


CONCLUSIONS
a sensitive and thoroughly evaluated real-time pcr was established. its high-throughput mode may show a useful approach to rapidly screen samples in local outbreaks for other organisms relevant for humans or animals. compared to a conventional pcr assay sensitivity of real-time pcr was higher after testing samples from a local q-fever outbreak.
