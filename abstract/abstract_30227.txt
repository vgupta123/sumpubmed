BACKGROUND
systemic acquired resistance  is an induced resistance response to pathogens, characterized by the translocation of a long-distance signal from induced leaves to distant tissues to prime them for increased resistance to future infection. defective in induced resistance  <dig>  has been hypothesized to chaperone a small signaling molecule to distant tissues during sar in arabidopsis.


RESULTS
dir <dig> promoter:dir1-gus/dir1- <dig> lines were constructed to examine dir <dig> expression. dir <dig> is expressed in seedlings, flowers and ubiquitously in untreated or mock-inoculated mature leaf cells, including phloem sieve elements and companion cells. inoculation of leaves with sar-inducing avirulent or virulent pseudomonas syringae pv tomato  resulted in type iii secretion system-dependent suppression of dir <dig> expression in leaf cells. transient expression of fluorescent fusion proteins in tobacco and intercellular washing fluid experiments indicated that dir1's er signal sequence targets it for secretion to the cell wall. however, dir <dig> expressed without a signal sequence rescued the dir1- <dig> sar defect, suggesting that a cytosolic pool of dir <dig> is important for the sar response.


CONCLUSIONS
although expression of dir <dig> decreases during sar induction, the protein localizes to all living cell types of the vasculature, including companion cells and sieve elements, and therefore dir <dig> is well situated to participate in long-distance signaling during sar.
