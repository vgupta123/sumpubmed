BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype enteritidis is known as an important and pathogenic clonal group which continues to cause worldwide sporadic cases and outbreaks in humans. here a new multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis  method is reported for highly-discriminative subtyping of salmonella enteritidis. emphasis was given on the most predominant phage types pt <dig> and pt <dig>  the method comprises multiplex pcr specifically amplifying repeated sequences from nine different loci followed by an automatic fragment size analysis using a multicolor capillary electrophoresis instrument. a total of  <dig> human, animal, food and environmental isolates of s. enteritidis including  <dig> definite phage types were used for development and validation. furthermore, the mlva types were compared to the phage types of several isolates from two recent outbreaks to determine the concordance between both methods and to estimate their in vivo stability. the in vitro stability of the two mlva types specifically for pt <dig> and pt <dig> strains were determined by multiple freeze-thaw cycles.


RESULTS
seventy-nine different mlva types were identified in  <dig> s. enteritidis strains. the simpson's diversity index for the mlva method was  <dig>  and nei diversity values for the nine vntr loci ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . twenty-four mlva types could be assigned to  <dig> pt <dig> strains and  <dig> types to  <dig> pt <dig> strains. all outbreak isolates had an indistinguishable outbreak specific mlva type. the in vitro stability experiments showed no changes of the mlva type compared to the original isolate.


CONCLUSIONS
this mlva method is useful to discriminate s. enteritidis strains even within a single phage type. it is easy in use, fast, and cheap compared to other high-resolution molecular methods and therefore an important tool for surveillance and outbreak studies for s. enteritidis.
