BACKGROUND
grape production in continental climatic regions suffers from the combination of drought and cold stresses during winter. developing a reliable system to simulate combined drought–cold stress and to determine physiological responses and regulatory mechanisms is important. evaluating tolerance to combined stress at germplasm level is crucial to select parents for breeding grapevines.


RESULTS
in the present study, two species, namely, vitis amurensis and v. vinifera cv. ‘muscat hamburg’, were used to develop a reliable system for evaluating their tolerance to drought–cold stress. this system used tissue −cultured grapevine plants, 6% peg solution, and gradient cooling mode to simulate drought–cold stress. v. amurensis had a significantly lower lt <dig> value  than ‘muscat hamburg’ during simulated drought–cold stress. thus, the former had higher tolerance than the latter to drought–cold stress based on electrolyte leakage  measurements. moreover, the chlorophyll fluorescence responses of v. amurensis and ‘muscat hamburg’ were also analyzed under drought–cold stress. the maximum photochemical quantum yield of ps ii  exhibited a significant linear correlationship with el. the relationship of el with fv/fm in the other four genotypes of grapevines under drought–cold stress was also detected.


CONCLUSIONS
a novel lt <dig> estimation model was established, and the lt <dig> values can be well calculated based on fv/fm in replacement of el measurement. the fv/fm–based model exhibits good reliability for evaluating the tolerance of different grapevine genotypes to drought–cold stress.
