BACKGROUND
rna-editing is a tightly regulated, and essential cellular process for a properly functioning brain. dysfunction of a-to-i rna editing can have catastrophic effects, particularly in the central nervous system. thus, understanding how the process of rna-editing is regulated has important implications for human health. however, at present, very little is known about the regulation of editing across tissues, and individuals.


RESULTS
here we present an analysis of rna-editing patterns from  <dig> different tissues harvested from a single mouse. for comparison, we also analyzed data for  <dig> of these tissues harvested from  <dig> additional animals. we find that tissue specificity of editing largely reflects differential expression of substrate transcripts across tissues. we identified a surprising enrichment of editing in intronic regions of brain transcripts, that could account for previously reported higher levels of editing in brain. there exists a small but remarkable amount of editing which is tissue-specific, despite comparable expression levels of the edit site across multiple tissues. expression levels of editing enzymes and their isoforms can explain some, but not all of this variation.


CONCLUSIONS
together, these data suggest a complex regulation of the rna-editing process beyond transcript expression levels.
