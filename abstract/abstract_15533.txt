BACKGROUND
in grapevine, as in other fruit crops, fruit size and seed content are key components of yield and quality; however, very few quantitative trait loci  for berry weight and seed content  have been discovered so far. to identify new stable qtls for marker-assisted selection and candidate gene identification, we performed simultaneous qtl detection in four mapping populations  with various genetic backgrounds.


RESULTS
for berry weight, we identified five new qtls, on linkage groups   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in addition to the known major qtl on lg  <dig>  the qtl with the largest effect explained up to 31% of total variance and was found in two genetically distant populations on lg  <dig>  where it colocalized with a published putative domestication locus. for seed traits, besides the major qtls on lg  <dig> previously reported, we found four new qtls explaining up to 51% of total variance, on lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the previously published qtl for seed number on lg  <dig> was found related in fact to sex. we found colocalizations between seed and berry weight qtls only for the major qtl on lg  <dig> in a seedless background, and on lgs  <dig> and  <dig> in a seeded background. candidate genes belonging to the cell number regulator cnr or cytochrome p <dig> families were found under the berry weight qtls on lgs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the involvement of these gene families in fruit weight was first described in tomato using a qtl-cloning approach. several other interesting candidate genes related to cell wall modifications, water import, auxin and ethylene signalling, transcription control, or organ identity were also found under berry weight qtls.


CONCLUSIONS
we discovered a total of nine new qtls for berry weight or seed traits in grapevine, thereby increasing more than twofold the number of reliable qtls for these traits available for marker assisted selection or candidate gene studies. the lack of colocalization between berry and seed qtls suggests that these traits may be partly dissociated.
