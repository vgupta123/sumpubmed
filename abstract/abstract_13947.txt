BACKGROUND
quantifying the robustness of biochemical models is important both for determining the validity of a natural system model and for designing reliable and robust synthetic biochemical networks. several tools have been proposed in the literature. unfortunately, multiparameter robustness analysis suffers from computational limitations.


RESULTS
a novel method for quantifying the robustness of oscillatory behavior to parameter perturbations is presented in this paper. this method relies on the combination of hopf bifurcation and routh-hurwitz stability criterion, which is widely applied in control system design. the proposed method is employed to calculate the robustness of two oscillating biochemical network models previously analyzed in the literature. the robustness bounds here obtained are tighter than what was previously obtained in the literature for both models.


CONCLUSIONS
the method here proposed for quantifying the robustness of biochemical oscillator models is computationally less demanding than similar multiparamter variation techniques available in the literature. it also provides tighter bounds on two models previously analyzed in the literature.
