BACKGROUND
toxin profiling helps in cataloguing the toxin present in the venom as well as in searching for novel toxins. the former helps in understanding potential pharmacological profile of the venom and evolution of toxins, while the latter contributes to understanding of novel mechanisms of toxicity and provide new research tools or prototypes of therapeutic agents.


RESULTS
the pygmy copperhead  is one of the less studied species. in this present study, an attempt has been made to describe the toxin profile of a. labialis from kangaroo island using the cdna library of its venom glands. we sequenced  <dig> clones which represent the common families of toxin genes present in snake venom. they include  putative long-chain and short-chain neurotoxins,  phospholipase a <dig>   kunitz-type protease inhibitor,  crisps,  c-type lectins and  metalloproteases. in addition, we have also identified a novel protein with two kunitz-type domains in tandem similar to bikunin.


CONCLUSIONS
interestingly, the cdna library reveals that most of the toxin families  have truncated transcripts due to insertion or deletion of nucleotides. these truncated products might not be functionally active proteins. however, cellular trancripts from the same venom glands are not affected. this unusual higher rate of deletion and insertion of nucleotide in toxin genes may be responsible for the lower toxicity of a. labialis venom of kangroo island and have significant effect on evolution of toxin genes.
