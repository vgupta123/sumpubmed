BACKGROUND
cysteinyl residues in actin are glutathionylated, ie. form a mixed disulfide with glutathione, even in the absence of exogenous oxidative stress. glutathionylation inhibits actin polymerization and reversible actin glutathionylation is a redox dependent mechanism for regulation of the cytoskeleton structure. the molecular mechanism that mediates actin glutathionylation in vivo is unclear.


RESULTS
we have studied glutathionylation of α- and β-actin in vitro using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay with a monoclonal anti-glutathione antibody. α- and β-actin were both glutathionylated when incubated with reduced glutathione  combined with diamide as a thiol oxidant. however, β-actin was also glutathionylated by both glutathione disulfide  and gsh in the absence of diamide whereas α-actin was poorly glutathionylated by gsh or gssg. glutathionylation of β-actin by gssg is likely to be mediated by a thiol-exchange mechanism whereas glutathionylation by gsh requires thiol oxidation. β-actin glutathionylation by gsh was inhibited by arsenite and dimedone suggesting that the mechanism involved formation of a cysteinyl sulfenic acid residue in β-actin.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that glutathionylation of β-actin may occur via spontaneous oxidation of a cysteinyl residue to a sulfenic acid that readily reacts with gsh to form a mixed disulfide. we also show that the reactivity and oxidation to a reactive protein thiol intermediary differ between different actin isoforms.
