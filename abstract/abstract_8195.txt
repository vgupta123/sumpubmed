BACKGROUND
borrelia burgdorferi contains one 16s and two tandem sets of 23s-5s ribosomal  rna genes whose patterns of transcription and regulation are unknown but are likely to be critical for survival and persistence in its hosts.


RESULTS
rt-pcr of b. burgdorferi n <dig> and b <dig> revealed three rrna region transcripts: 16s rrna-alanine transfer rna ; trnaile; and both sets of 23s-5s rrna. at 34째c, there were no differences in growth rate or in accumulation of total protein, dna and rna in b <dig> cultured in barbour-stoenner-kelly -h whether rabbit serum was present or not. at 23째c, b <dig> grew more slowly in serum-containing bsk-h than at 34째c. dna per cell was higher in cells in exponential as compared to stationary phase at either temperature; protein per cell was similar at both temperatures in both phases. similar amounts of rrna were produced in exponential phase at both temperatures, and rrna was down-regulated in stationary phase at either temperature. interestingly, a relbbu deletion mutant unable to generate ppgpp did not down-regulate rrna at transition to stationary phase in serum-containing bsk-h at 34째c, similar to the relaxed phenotype of e. coli rela mutants.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that rrna transcription in b. burgdorferi is complex and regulated both by growth phase and by the stringent response but not by temperature-modulated growth rate.
