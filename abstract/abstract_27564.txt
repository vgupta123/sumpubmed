BACKGROUND
latimeria menadoensis is a coelacanth species first identified in  <dig> in indonesia, at  <dig>  km of distance from its african congener. to date, only six specimens have been caught and just a very limited molecular data is available. in the present work we describe the de novo transcriptome assembly obtained from liver and testis samples collected from the fifth specimen ever caught of this species.


RESULTS
the deep rna sequencing performed with illumina technologies generated  <dig> , <dig> paired-end reads, accounting for ~14Â gb of sequence data, which were de novo assembled using a trinity/clc combined strategy. the assembly output was processed and filtered producing a set of  <dig>  contigs, whose quality was thoroughly assessed. the comparison with the recently sequenced genome of the african congener latimeria chalumnae and with the available genomic resources of other vertebrates revealed a good reconstruction of full length transcripts and a high coverage of the predicted full coelacanth transcriptome.

the rna-seq analysis revealed remarkable differences in the expression profiles between the two tissues, allowing the identification of liver- and testis-specific transcripts which may play a fundamental role in important biological processes carried out by these two organs.


CONCLUSIONS
given the high genomic affinity between the two coelacanth species, the here described de novo transcriptome assembly can be considered a valuable support tool for the improvement of gene prediction within the genome of l. chalumnae and a valuable resource for investigation of many aspects of tetrapod evolution.
