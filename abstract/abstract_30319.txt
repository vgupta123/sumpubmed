BACKGROUND
the calsarcins comprise a novel family of muscle-specific calcineurin-interaction proteins that play an important role in modulating both the function and substrate specificity of calcineurin in muscle cells. the expression of calsarcin- <dig>  is restricted to slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibres, whereas that of both calsarcin- <dig>  and calsarcin- <dig>  is enriched in fast-twitch fibres. however, the transcriptional control of this selective expression has not been previously elucidated.


RESULTS
our real-time rt-pcr analyses suggest that the expression of cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> is increased during the myogenic differentiation of mouse c2c <dig> cells. promoter deletion analysis further suggests that an nf-κb binding site within the cs- <dig> promoter is responsible for the up-regulation of cs- <dig> transcription, but no similar mechanism was evident for cs- <dig>  these findings are further supported by the results of emsa analysis, as well as by overexpression and inhibition experiments in which nf-κb function was blocked by treatment with its inhibitor, pdtc. in addition, the overexpression of nfatc <dig> induces both the cs- <dig> and cs- <dig> promoters, whereas mef2c only activates cs- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our present data suggest that nf-κb is required for the transcription of mouse cs- <dig> but not cs- <dig>  and that the regulation of the calsarcins is mediated also by the nfat and mef <dig> transcription factors. these results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms governing transcription in specific muscle fibre cells. the calsarcins may also serve as a valuable mechanistic tool to better understand the regulation of calcineurin signalling during muscle differentiation.
