BACKGROUND
a significant percentage of patients with pancreatitis often presents a history of excessive alcohol consumption. nevertheless, the patho-physiological effect of ethanol on pancreatitis remains poorly understood. in the present study, we have investigated the early effects of acute ethanol exposure on cck-8-evoked ca2+ signals in mouse pancreatic acinar cells. changes in i and ros production were analyzed employing fluorescence techniques after loading cells with fura- <dig> or cm-h2dcfda, respectively.


RESULTS
ethanol, in the concentration range from  <dig> to  <dig> mm, evoked an oscillatory pattern in i. in addition, ethanol evoked reactive oxygen species generation  production. stimulation of cells with  <dig> nm or  <dig> pm cck- <dig>  respectively led to a transient change and oscillations in i. in the presence of ethanol a transformation of  <dig> pm cck-8-evoked physiological oscillations into a single transient increase in i in the majority of cells was observed. whereas, in response to  <dig> nm cck- <dig>  the total ca2+ mobilization was significantly increased by ethanol pre-treatment. preincubation of cells with  <dig> mm 4-mp, an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, or  <dig> Î¼m of the antioxidant cinnamtannin b- <dig>  reverted the effect of ethanol on total ca2+ mobilization evoked by  <dig> nm cck- <dig>  cinnamtannin b- <dig> blocked ethanol-evoked ros production.


CONCLUSIONS
ethanol may lead, either directly or through ros generation, to an over stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells in response to cck- <dig>  resulting in a higher ca2+ mobilization compared to normal conditions. the actions of ethanol on cck-8-stimulation of cells create a situation potentially leading to ca2+ overload, which is a common pathological precursor that mediates pancreatitis.
