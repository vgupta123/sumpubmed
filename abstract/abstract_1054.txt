BACKGROUND
myelination of peripheral nerves by schwann cells requires not only the egr2/krox- <dig> transactivator, but also the ngfi-a/egr-binding  corepressors, which modulate activity of egr <dig>  previous work has shown that axon-dependent expression of egr <dig> is mediated by neuregulin stimulation, and nab corepressors are co-regulated with egr <dig> expression in peripheral nerve development. nab corepressors have also been implicated in macrophage development, cardiac hypertrophy, prostate carcinogenesis, and feedback regulation involved in hindbrain development.


RESULTS
to test the mechanism of nab regulation in schwann cells, transfection assays revealed that both nab <dig> and nab <dig> promoters are activated by egr <dig> expression. furthermore, direct binding of egr <dig> at these promoters was demonstrated in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of myelinating sciatic nerve, and binding of egr <dig> to the nab <dig> promoter was stimulated by neuregulin in primary schwann cells. although egr <dig> expression activates the nab <dig> promoter more highly than nab <dig>  we surprisingly found that only nab <dig> – but not nab <dig> – expression levels were reduced in sciatic nerve from egr <dig> null mice. analysis of the nab <dig> promoter showed that it is also activated by ets proteins  and is bound by ets <dig> in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, these results indicate that induction of nab <dig> expression in schwann cells involves not only egr <dig>  but also ets proteins that are activated by neuregulin stimulation. although nab <dig> and nab <dig> play partially redundant roles, regulation of nab <dig> expression by ets factors explains several observations regarding regulation of nab genes. finally, these data suggest that nab proteins are not only feedback inhibitors of egr <dig>  but rather that co-induction of egr <dig> and nab genes is involved in forming an egr2/nab complex that is crucial for regulation of gene expression.
