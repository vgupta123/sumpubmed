BACKGROUND
mass spectrometry based proteomics result in huge amounts of data that has to be processed in real time in order to efficiently feed identification algorithms and to easily integrate in automated environments. we present wiff2dta, a tool created to convert ms/ms data obtained using applied biosystem's qstar and qtrap  <dig> and  <dig> series.


RESULTS
comparing the performance of wiff2dta with the standard tools, we find wiff2dta being the fastest solution for extracting spectrum data from abis raw file format. wiff2dta is at least 10% faster than the standard tools. it is also capable of batch processing and can be easily integrated in high throughput environments. the program is freely available via ,  and is also available from applied biosystems.


CONCLUSIONS
wiff2dta offers the possibility to run as stand-alone application or within a batch process as command-line tool integrated in automation and high-throughput environments. it is more efficient than the state-of-the-art tools provided.
