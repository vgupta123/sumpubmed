BACKGROUND
promoter region plays an important role in determining where the transcription of a particular gene should be initiated. computational prediction of eukaryotic pol ii promoter sequences is one of the most significant problems in sequence analysis. existing promoter prediction methods are still far from being satisfactory.


RESULTS
we attempt to recognize the human pol ii promoter sequences from the non-promoter sequences which are made up of exon and intron sequences. four methods are used: two kinds of multifractal analysis performed on the numeric sequences obtained from the dinucleotide free energy, z curve analysis and global descriptor of the promoter/non-promoter primary sequences. a total of  <dig> parameters are extracted from these methods and categorized into seven groups . they are used to generate certain spaces and then each promoter/non-promoter sequence is represented by a point in the corresponding space. all the  <dig> possible combinations of the seven methods are tested. based on fisher's linear discriminant algorithm, with a relatively smaller number of parameters , we get satisfactory discriminant accuracies. particularly, in the case of  <dig> parameters, the accuracies for the training and test sets reach  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. a comparison with five other existing methods indicates that our methods have a better performance. using the global descriptor method ,  <dig> of the  <dig> experimentally verified promoter sequences of human chromosome  <dig> are correctly identified.


CONCLUSIONS
the high accuracies achieved suggest that the methods of this paper are useful for understanding the difficult problem of promoter prediction.
