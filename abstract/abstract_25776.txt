BACKGROUND
white lupin  roots efficiently take up and accumulate  metals, adapt to phosphate deficiency by forming cluster roots, and secrete antimicrobial prenylated isoflavones during development. genomic and proteomic approaches were applied to identify candidate genes and proteins involved in antimicrobial defense and  metal uptake and translocation.


RESULTS
a cdna library was constructed from roots of white lupin seedlings. eight thousand clones were randomly sequenced and assembled into  <dig>  unigenes, which were annotated based on homologous matches in the ncbinr protein database. a reference map of developing white lupin root proteins was established through 2-d gel electrophoresis and peptide mass fingerprinting. high quality peptide mass spectra were obtained for  <dig> proteins. microsomal membrane proteins were separated by 1-d gel electrophoresis and identified by lc-ms/ms. a total of  <dig> proteins were putatively identified by the peptide mass fingerprinting and the lc-ms/ms methods. genomic and proteomic analyses identified candidate genes and proteins encoding metal binding and/or transport proteins, transcription factors, abc transporters and phenylpropanoid biosynthetic enzymes.


CONCLUSIONS
the combined est and protein datasets will facilitate the understanding of white lupin's response to biotic and abiotic stresses and its utility for phytoremediation. the root ests provided  <dig> perfect simple sequence repeat  markers with potential utility in breeding white lupin for enhanced agronomic traits.
