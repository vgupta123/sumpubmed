BACKGROUND
plants have evolved a complicated resistance system and exhibit a variety of defense patterns in response to different attackers. previous studies have shown that responses of plants to chewing insects and phloem-feeding insects are significantly different. less is known, however, regarding molecular responses to leafminer insects. to investigate plant transcriptome response to leafminers, we selected the leafminer liriomyza huidobrensis, which has a special feeding pattern more similar to pathogen damage than that of chewing insects, as a model insect, and arabidopsis thaliana as a response plant.


RESULTS
we first investigated local and systemic responses of a. thaliana to leafminer feeding using an affymetrix ath <dig> genome array. genes related to metabolic processes and stimulus responses were highly regulated. most systemically-induced genes formed a subset of the local response genes. we then downloaded gene expression data from online databases and used hierarchical clustering to explore relationships among gene expression patterns in a. thaliana damaged by different attackers.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that plant response patterns are strongly coupled to damage patterns of attackers.
