BACKGROUND
regions with copy number variations  or copy number alteration  are of great interest for human disease gene mapping and cancer studies. they represent a new type of mutation and are larger-scaled than the single nucleotide polymorphisms. using genotyping microarray for copy number variation detection has become standard, and there is a need for improving analysis methods.


RESULTS
we apply the cumulative plot to the detection of regions with copy number variation/alteration, on samples taken from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient. two sets of whole-genome genotyping of  <dig> k single nucleotide polymorphisms, one from the normal cell and another from the cancer cell, are analyzed. we demonstrate the utility of cumulative plot in detecting a  <dig> mb  hemizygous deletion and  <dig> mb homozygous deletion on chromosome  <dig>  we also show the possibility to detect smaller copy number variation/alteration regions below the  <dig> kb range.


CONCLUSIONS
as a graphic tool, the cumulative plot is an intuitive and a scale-free  way for detecting copy number variation/alteration regions, especially when such regions are small.
