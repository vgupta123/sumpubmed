BACKGROUND
tissue networks such as the vascular networks of plant and animal organs transport signals and nutrients in most multicellular organisms. the transport function of tissue networks depends on topological features such as the number of networks’ components and the components’ connectedness; yet what controls tissue network topology is largely unknown, partly because of the difficulties in quantifying the effects of genes on tissue network topology. we address this problem for the vein networks of plant leaves by introducing biologically motivated descriptors of vein network topology; we combine these descriptors with cellular imaging and molecular genetic analysis; and we apply this combination of approaches to leaves of arabidopsis thaliana that lack function of, overexpress or misexpress combinations of four pin-formed  genes—pin <dig>  pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin8—which encode transporters of the plant signal auxin and are known to control vein network geometry.


RESULTS
we find that pin <dig> inhibits vein formation and connection, and that pin <dig> acts redundantly to pin <dig> in these processes; however, the functions of pin <dig> in vein formation are nonhomologous to those of pin <dig>  while the functions of pin <dig> in vein connection are homologous to those of pin <dig>  we further find that pin <dig> provides functions redundant and homologous to those of pin <dig> in pin1-dependent inhibition of vein formation, but that pin <dig> has no functions in pin1/pin6-dependent inhibition of vein connection. finally, we find that pin <dig> promotes vein formation; that all the vein-formation-promoting functions of pin <dig> are redundantly inhibited by pin <dig> and pin8; and that these functions of pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> are independent of pin <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that pin-mediated auxin transport controls the formation of veins and their connection into networks.
