BACKGROUND
cronobacter is a recently proposed genus consisting of six genomospecies that encompass the organisms previously identified as enterobacter sakazakii. cronobacter are opportunistic pathogens and are known to cause serious infections in infants, particularly neonates. high case fatality rates have been associated with infections and acute sequelae can occur in survivors with severe ramifications on neurological development. infant formula has been identified as one route of transmission for infection in infants. however, the primary reservoirs for subsequent contamination of foods with cronobacter remain undefined due to the ubiquitous nature of these organisms. more recently, infections in adults have been reported, especially amongst the elderly and patients who are immunocompromised. to help prevent the transmission of infection, it is important to identify the main food sources for cronobacter. the aim of this study was to identify and characterize cronobacter isolated from dried-milk and related products available in an egyptian food market.


RESULTS
in total sixteen cronobacter strains were isolated from  <dig> dairy-based products. these were identified and characterized using pheno- and genotyping experiments. real-time pcr confirmed the detection of cronobacter. following antibiotic susceptibility tests,  <dig> strains showed resistance to trimethoprim and/or neomycin. phenotype profiles were generated based on key biochemical distinguishing tests. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  identified  <dig> pfge types amongst the collection of strains. repetitive sequence based pcr  analysis identified  <dig> rep-pcr types amongst the collection of strains. sequencing of the recn gene was used to differentiate among the recently described species of cronobacter.


CONCLUSIONS
this study identified the presence of cronobacter in dried milk and related products sourced from the nile-delta region of egypt. although the majority of the strains were susceptible to the antibiotics tested, resistance was observed in three isolates, highlighting the risks associated with cronobacter contamination in foods. phenotype and genotype analysis should be applied to further characterize cronobacter spp. and prevent its transmission into food products.
