BACKGROUND
endothelial-mesenchymal transition  has been shown to be a major source of myofibroblasts, contributing to kidney fibrosis. however, in vitro study of endothelial cells often relies on culture of isolated primary endothelial cells due to the unavailability of endothelial cell lines. our recent study suggested that peritubular endothelial cells could contribute to kidney fibrosis through endomt. therefore, successful isolation and culture of mouse peritubular endothelial cells could provide a new platform for studying kidney fibrosis. this study describes an immunomagnetic separation method for the isolation of mouse renal peritubular endothelial cells using anti-cd <dig> microbeads, followed by co-culture with mouse renal proximal tubular epithelial cells to maintain endothelial phenotype.


RESULTS
flow cytometry showed that after isolation and two days of culture, about 95% of cells were positive for endothelial-specific marker cd <dig>  the percentage of other cells, including dendritic cells  and macrophages , was less than 1%. maintenance of endothelial cell phenotype required vascular endothelial growth factor  and co-culture with mouse proximal tubular epithelial cells.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we established a method for the isolation of mouse renal peritubular endothelial cells by using immunomagnetic separation with anti-cd <dig> microbeads, followed by co-culture with mouse renal proximal tubular epithelial cells to maintain phenotype.
