BACKGROUND
sustainable dna resources and reliable high-throughput genotyping methods are required for large-scale, long-term genetic association studies. in the genetic dissection of common disease it is now recognised that thousands of samples and hundreds of thousands of markers, mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms , will have to be analysed. in order to achieve these aims, both an ability to boost quantities of archived dna and to genotype at low costs are highly desirable. we have investigated Φ <dig> polymerase multiple displacement amplification -generated dna product , in combination with highly multiplexed beadarray™ genotyping technology. as part of a large-scale beadarray genotyping experiment we made a direct comparison of genotyping data generated from mda product with that from genomic dna  templates.


RESULTS
eighty-six mda product and the corresponding  <dig> gdna samples were genotyped at  <dig> snps and a concordance rate of  <dig> % was achieved. the beadarray sample exclusion rate, blind to sample type, was  <dig> % for mda product compared to  <dig> % for gdna.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the beadarray technology successfully produces high quality genotyping data from mda product. the combination of these technologies improves the feasibility and efficiency of mapping common disease susceptibility genes despite limited stocks of gdna samples.
