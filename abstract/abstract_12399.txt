BACKGROUND
host genetic variations may contribute to disease susceptibility of influenza. il-1a and il-1b are important inflammatory cytokines that mediate the inflammation and initiate the immune response against virus infection. in this study, we investigated the relationship between single-nucleotide polymorphisms  of interleukin-1a  and interleukin-1b  and the susceptibility to  <dig> pandemic a/h1n <dig> influenza pdm09).  <dig> patients whom were confirmed with apdm <dig> and  <dig> healthy controls were included in this study. four snps  in il1a gene and three snps  in il1b gene were genotyped by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight  mass spectrometry platform, and the associations of the genetic variants of il- <dig> with susceptibility to apdm <dig> were then assessed.


RESULTS
the polymorphisms of rs <dig> in il1a gene and rs <dig> in il1b gene were found to be associated with susceptibility to apdm <dig> with p values of  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively. however, no significant difference in allelic frequency was observed for other snps between cases and controls.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a new insight into pathogenesis of apdm <dig>  suggesting that genetic variants of il-1a and il-1b may exert a substantial impact on the susceptibility of apdm <dig> virus infection.
