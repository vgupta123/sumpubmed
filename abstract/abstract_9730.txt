BACKGROUND
the human pob1/reps <dig>  protein is highly conserved in mammals where it has been suggested to function as a molecular scaffold recruiting proteins involved in vesicular traffic and linking them to the actin cytoskeleton remodeling machinery. more recently pob1/reps <dig> was found highly expressed in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines, while one of its isoforms  is down regulated during prostate cancer progression.


RESULTS
in this report we characterize the central proline rich domain of pob1/reps <dig> and we describe for the first time its functional role in receptor endocytosis. we show that the ectopic expression of this domain has a dominant negative effect on the endocytosis of activated epidermal growth factor receptor  while leaving transferrin receptor endocytosis unaffected. by a combination of different approaches , we have identified two closely spaced binding motifs for 14-3- <dig> and for the sh <dig> of the proteins amphiphysin ii and grb <dig>  differently from wild type, proline rich domains that are altered in these motifs do not inhibit egfr endocytosis, suggesting that these binding motifs play a functional role in this process.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings are relevant to the characterization of the molecular mechanism underlying the involvement of pob1/reps <dig>  sh <dig> and 14-3- <dig> proteins in receptor endocytosis, suggesting that 14-3- <dig> could work by bridging the egf receptor and the scaffold protein pob1/reps <dig>
