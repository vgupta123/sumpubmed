BACKGROUND
previous studies have shown that there is a time-dependent upregulation of contractile endothelin b  receptors in middle cerebral arteries  after organ culture. this upregulation is dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinases and possibly protein kinase c . the aim of this study was to examine the effect of pkc inhibitors with different profiles on the upregulation of contractile etb receptors in rat mca. artery segments were incubated for  <dig> hours at 37°c. to investigate involvement of pkc, inhibitors were added to the medium before incubation. the contractile endothelin-mediated responses were measured and real-time pcr was used to detect endothelin receptor mrna levels. furthermore, immunohistochemistry was used to demonstrate the etb receptor protein distribution in the mca and western blot to measure which of the pkc subtypes that were affected by the inhibitors.


RESULTS
the pkc inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide i, ro-32- <dig> and pkc inhibitor 20– <dig> attenuated the etb receptor mediated contractions. furthermore, ro-32- <dig> and bisindolylmaleimide i decreased etb receptor mrna levels while pkc inhibitor 20– <dig> reduced the amount of receptor protein on smooth muscle cells. pkc inhibitor 20– <dig> also decreased the protein levels of the five pkc subtypes studied .


CONCLUSIONS
the results show that pkc inhibitors are able to decrease the etb receptor contraction and expression in mca smooth muscle cells following organ culture. the pkc inhibitor 20– <dig> affects the protein levels, while ro-32- <dig> and bisindolylmaleimide i affect the mrna levels, suggesting differences in activity profile. since etb receptor upregulation is seen in cerebral ischemia, the results of the present study provide a way to interfere with the vascular involvement in cerebral ischemia.
