BACKGROUND
down syndrome  is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation in the human population and key molecular networks dysregulated in ds are still unknown. many different experimental techniques have been applied to analyse the effects of dosage imbalance at the molecular and phenotypical level, however, currently no integrative approach exists that attempts to extract the common information.


RESULTS
we have performed a statistical meta-analysis from  <dig> heterogeneous publicly available ds data sets in order to identify consistent dosage effects from these studies. we identified  <dig> genes with significant genome-wide dosage effects, including well investigated genes like sod <dig>  app, runx <dig> and dyrk1a as well as a large proportion of novel genes . furthermore, we characterized these genes using gene ontology, molecular interactions and promoter sequence analysis. in order to judge relevance of the  <dig> genes for more general cerebral pathologies we used independent publicly available microarry data from brain studies not related with ds and identified a subset of  <dig> genes with potential impact for neurocognitive processes. all results have been made available through a web server under http://ds-geneminer.molgen.mpg.de/.


CONCLUSIONS
our study represents a comprehensive integrative analysis of heterogeneous data including genome-wide transcript levels in the domain of trisomy  <dig>  the detected dosage effects build a resource for further studies of ds pathology and the development of new therapies.
