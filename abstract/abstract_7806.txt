BACKGROUND
for centuries roses have been selected based on a number of traits. little information exists on the genetic and molecular basis that contributes to these traits, mainly because information on expressed genes for this economically important ornamental plant is scarce.


RESULTS
here, we used a combination of illumina and  <dig> sequencing technologies to generate information on rosa sp. transcripts using rna from various tissues and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. a total of  <dig> transcript clusters were identified and  <dig> peptides have been predicted among which  <dig> have been clustered into  <dig> protein families. blastp hits in closely related rosaceae species revealed that about half of the predicted peptides in the strawberry and peach genomes have orthologs in rosa dataset. digital expression was obtained using rna samples from organs at different development stages and under different stress conditions. qpcr validated the digital expression data for a selection of  <dig> genes with high or low expression levels. comparative gene expression analyses between the different tissues and organs allowed the identification of clusters that are highly enriched in given tissues or under particular conditions, demonstrating the usefulness of the digital gene expression analysis. a web interface rosaseq was created that allows data interrogation by blast, subsequent analysis of dna clusters and access to thorough transcript annotation including best blast matches on fragaria vesca, prunus persica and arabidopsis. the rose peptides dataset was used to create the rosacyc resource pathway database that allows access to the putative genes and enzymatic pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
the study provides useful information on rosa expressed genes, with thorough annotation and an overview of expression patterns for transcripts with good accuracy.
