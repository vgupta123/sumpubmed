BACKGROUND
to safeguard the food supply for the growing human population, it is important to understand and exploit the genetic basis of quantitative traits. next-generation sequencing technology performs advantageously and effectively in genetic mapping and genome analysis of diverse genetic resources. hence, we combined re-sequencing technology and a bin map strategy to construct an ultra-high-density bin map with thousands of bin markers to precisely map a quantitative trait locus.


RESULTS
in this study, we generated a linkage map containing  <dig> , <dig> high quality snps between mo <dig> and b <dig>  which were verified in the maize intermated b73 × mo <dig>  syn <dig> population. this resource is an excellent complement to existing maize genetic maps available in an online database  . moreover, in this population combined with the ibm syn <dig> ril population, we detected  <dig> qtls for flowering time and plant height traits across the two populations. eighteen known functional genes and twenty-five candidate genes for flowering time and plant height trait were fine-mapped into a  <dig> – <dig>  mb interval. map expansion and segregation distortion were also analyzed, and evidence for inadvertent selection of early flowering time in the process of mapping population development was observed. furthermore, an updated integrated map with  <dig> , <dig> high-quality snps,  <dig>  traditional markers and  <dig>  bin markers was constructed. the data were deposited into the iplant discovery environment , which provides a fundamental resource of genetic data for the maize genetic research community.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings provide basic essential genetic data for the maize genetic research community. an updated ibm syn <dig> population and a reliable, verified high-quality snp set between mo <dig> and b <dig> will aid in future molecular breeding efforts.
