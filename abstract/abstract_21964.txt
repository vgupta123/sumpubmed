BACKGROUND
partitioning the human immunoglobulin variable region into variable , diversity , and joining  segments is a common sequence analysis step. we introduce a novel approximate dynamic programming method that uses conserved immunoglobulin gene motifs to improve performance of aligning v-segments of rearranged immunoglobulin  genes. our new algorithm enhances the former joinsolver algorithm by processing sequences with insertions and/or deletions  and improves the efficiency for large datasets provided by high throughput sequencing.


RESULTS
in our simulations, which include rearrangements with indels, the v-matching success rate improved from 61% for partial alignments of sequences with indels in the original algorithm to over 99% in the approximate algorithm. an improvement in the alignment of human vdj rearrangements over the initial joinsolver algorithm was also seen when compared to the stanford.s <dig> human ig dataset with an online vdj partitioning software evaluation tool.


CONCLUSIONS
htjoinsolver can rapidly identify v- and j-segments with indels to high accuracy for mutated sequences when the mutation probability is around 30% and 20% respectively. the d-segment is much harder to fit even at 20% mutation probability. for all segments, the probability of correctly matching v, d, and j increases with our alignment score.
