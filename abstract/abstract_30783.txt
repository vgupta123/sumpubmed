BACKGROUND
the arabidopsis ortholog of the  <dig> kd subunit of the mammalian cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor  is an rna-binding endonuclease that is associated with other arabidopsis cpsf subunits . in order to further explore the functions of atcpsf <dig>  the subcellular distribution of the protein was examined by over-expressing fusion proteins containing fluorescent reporters linked to different cpsf subunits.


RESULTS
it was found that atcpsf <dig> by itself localizes, not to the nucleus, but to the cytoplasm. atcpsf <dig> could be found in the nucleus when co-expressed with atcpsf <dig> or atcpsf <dig>  one of the two arabidopsis orthologs of cpsf <dig>  this re-directing of atcpsf <dig> indicates that atcpsf <dig> is retained in the nucleus via interactions with either or both of these other cpsf subunits. co-expression of atcspf <dig> with atcpsf <dig> altered the location, not of atcpsf <dig>  but rather of atcpsf <dig>  with these proteins residing in the cytoplasm. deletion of plant-specific n- or c-terminal domains of atcpsf <dig> abolished various of the interactions between atcpsf <dig> and other cpsf subunits, suggesting that the plant cpsf complex assembles via novel protein-protein interactions.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that the nuclear cpsf complex in plants is a dynamic one, and that the interactions between atcpsf <dig> and other cpsf subunits are different from those existing in other eukaryotes.
