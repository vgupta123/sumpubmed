BACKGROUND
the interactions of microbes with metal ions form an important basis for our study of biotechnological applications. despite the recent progress in studying some properties of au adsorption and reduction by bacillus megatherium d <dig> biomass, there is still a need for additional data on the molecular mechanisms of biosorbents responsible for their interactions with au to have a further insight and to make a better exposition.


RESULTS
the biosorption mechanism of au onto the resting cell of bacillus megatherium d <dig> biomass on a molecular level has been further studied here. the infrared  spectroscopy on d <dig> biomass and that binding au demonstrates that the molecular recognition of and binding to au appear to occur mostly with oxygenous- and nitrogenous-active groups of polysaccharides and proteins in cell wall biopolymers, such as hydroxyl of saccharides, carboxylate anion of amino-acid residues , peptide bond , etc.; and that the active groups must serve as nucleation sites for au nuclei growth. a further investigation on the interactions of each of the soluble hydrolysates of d <dig>  bacillus licheniformis r <dig>  lactobacillus sp. strain a <dig> and waste saccharomyces cerevisiae biomasses with au by ir spectrometry clearly reveals an essential biomacromolecule-characteristic that seems the binding of au to the oxygen of the peptide bond has caused a significant, molecular conformation-rearrangement in polypeptide backbones from β-pleated sheet to α-helices and/or β-turns of protein secondary structure; and that this changing appears to be accompanied by the occurrence, in the peptide bond, of much unbound -c=o and h-n- groups, being freed from the inter-molecular hydrogen-bonding of the β-pleated sheet and carried on the helical forms, as well as by the alternation in side chain steric positions of protein primary structure. this might be reasonably expected to result in higher-affinity interactions of peptide bond and side chains with au.


CONCLUSIONS
the evidence suggests that the polypeptides appear to be activated by the intervention of au via the molecular reconformation and in turn react upon au actively and exert profound impacts on the course of au nucleation and crystal growth.
