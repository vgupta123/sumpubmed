BACKGROUND
microarray analyses allow the identification and assessment of molecular signatures in whole tissues undergoing pathological processes. to better understand cerebral malaria pathogenesis, we investigated intra-cerebral gene-expression profiles in well-defined genetically cerebral malaria-resistant  and cm-susceptible  mice, upon infection by plasmodium berghei anka . we investigated mouse transcriptional responses at early and late stages of infection by use of cdna microarrays.


RESULTS
through a rigorous statistical approach with multiple testing corrections, we showed that pba significantly altered brain gene expression in cm-r , and in cm-s  mice, and that  <dig> genes discriminated between early and late infection stages, between mouse strains, and between cm-r and cm-s mice. we further identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> genes with significant differential expression between cm-r and cm-s mice on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> respectively. the analysis of their functional annotation indicates that genes involved in metabolic energy pathways, the inflammatory response, and the neuroprotection/neurotoxicity balance play a major role in cerebral malaria pathogenesis. in addition, our data suggest that cerebral malaria and alzheimer's disease may share some common mechanisms of pathogenesis, as illustrated by the accumulation of Î²-amyloid proteins in brains of cm-s mice, but not of cm-r mice.


CONCLUSIONS
our microarray analysis highlighted marked changes in several molecular pathways in cm-s compared to cm-r mice, particularly at early stages of infection. this study revealed some promising areas for exploration that may both provide new insight into the knowledge of cm pathogenesis and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
