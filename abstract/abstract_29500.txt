BACKGROUND
breast milk contains complex nutrients and facilitates the maturation of various biological systems in infants. exosomes, membranous vesicles of endocytic origin found in different body fluids such as milk, can mediate intercellular communication. we hypothesized that micrornas , a class of non-coding small rnas of 18– <dig> nt which are known to be packaged in exosomes of human, bovine and porcine milk, may play important roles in the development of piglets.


RESULTS
in this study, exosomes of approximately 100 nm in diameter were isolated from porcine milk through serial centrifugation and ultracentrifugation procedures. total rna was extracted from exosomes, and 5s ribosomal rna was found to be the major rna component. solexa sequencing showed a total of  <dig> mirnas, including  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mature mirnas , which were distributed among  <dig> clusters and  <dig> families, and two predicted novel mirnas were verified targeting 3’utr of igf-1r by luciferase assay. interestingly, we observed that three mirnas  could be generated from mirna-offset rnas . the top  <dig> mirnas accounted for  <dig> %  of total counts, which were predicted to target  <dig>  genes by rnahybrid software. gene ontology and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway analyses using david bioinformatics resources indicated that the identified mirnas targeted genes enriched in transcription, immunity and metabolism processes, and  <dig> of the top  <dig> mirnas possibly participate in regulation of the iga immune network.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that porcine milk exosomes contain a large number of mirnas, which potentially play an important role in information transfer from sow milk to piglets. the predicted mirnas of porcine milk exosomes in this study provide a basis for future biochemical and biophysical function studies.
