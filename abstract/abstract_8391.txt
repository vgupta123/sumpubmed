BACKGROUND
polychlorinated biphenyls  are persistent organic pollutants  with harmful effects in animals and humans. although pcb  <dig> is one of the most abundant among pcbs detected in animal tissues, its mechanism of toxicity is not well understood. only few studies have been conducted to explore genes and pathways affected by pcb  <dig> by using high throughput transcriptomics approaches. to obtain better insights into toxicity mechanisms, we treated juvenile atlantic cod  with pcb  <dig>  for 2 weeks and performed gene expression analysis in the liver using oligonucleotide arrays.


RESULTS
whole-genome gene expression analysis detected about  <dig> differentially regulated genes. functional enrichment, interactome, network and gene set enrichment analysis of the differentially regulated genes suggested that pathways associated with cell cycle, lipid metabolism, immune response, apoptosis and stress response were among the top significantly enriched. particularly, genes coding for proteins in dna replication/cell cycle pathways and enzymes of lipid biosynthesis were up-regulated suggesting increased cell proliferation and lipogenesis, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
pcb  <dig> appears to activate cell proliferation and lipogenic genes in cod liver. transcriptional up-regulation of marker genes for lipid biosynthesis resembles lipogenic effects previously reported for persistent organic pollutants  and other environmental chemicals. our results provide new insights into mechanisms of pcb  <dig> induced toxicity.
