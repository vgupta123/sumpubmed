BACKGROUND
nxt <dig> is a member of nxt family proteins that are generally involved in exporting nuclear rna in eukaryotic cells. it is not known if nxt <dig> has any function in specific biological processes.


RESULTS
a zebrafish mutant exhibiting specific heart defects during embryogenesis was generated by animal cloning-mediated retroviral insertions. molecular analysis indicated that the mutant phenotype was caused by a disruption of nxt <dig>  whole-mount rna in situ hybridization showed that nxt <dig> transcripts were clearly detectable in embryonic heart as well as other tissues. further analysis revealed that expression level of one form of alternative splicing nxt <dig> mrna transcripts was significantly reduced, resulting in deficient myocardial cell differentiation and the malformation of cardiac valve at the atrioventricular boundary. the defects could be reproduced by morpholino anti-sense oligo knockdown of nxt <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
nxt <dig> has a critical role in maintaining morphogenetic integrity of embryonic heart in vertebrate species.
