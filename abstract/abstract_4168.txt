BACKGROUND
good automatic information extraction tools offer hope for automatic processing of the exploding biomedical literature, and successful named entity recognition is a key component for such tools.

methods
we present a maximum-entropy based system incorporating a diverse set of features for identifying gene and protein names in biomedical abstracts.


RESULTS
this system was entered in the biocreative comparative evaluation and achieved a precision of  <dig>  and recall of  <dig>  in the "open" evaluation and a precision of  <dig>  and recall of  <dig>  in the "closed" evaluation.


CONCLUSIONS
central contributions are rich use of features derived from the training data at multiple levels of granularity, a focus on correctly identifying entity boundaries, and the innovative use of several external knowledge sources including full medline abstracts and web searches.
