BACKGROUND
repulsive guidance molecule c , a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein expressed in liver and striated muscle, plays a central role in systemic iron balance. inactivating mutations in the rgmc gene cause juvenile hemochromatosis , a rapidly progressing iron storage disorder with severe systemic manifestations. rgmc undergoes complex biosynthetic steps leading to membrane-bound and soluble forms of the protein, including both  <dig> and  <dig> kda single-chain species.


RESULTS
we now show that pro-protein convertases  are responsible for conversion of  <dig> kda rgmc to a  <dig> kda protein with a truncated cooh-terminus. unlike related molecules rgma and rgmb, rgmc encodes a conserved pc recognition and cleavage site, and jh-associated rgmc frame-shift mutants undergo cooh-terminal cleavage only if this site is present. a cell-impermeable peptide pc inhibitor blocks the appearance of  <dig> kda rgmc in extra-cellular fluid, as does an engineered mutation in the conserved pc recognition sequence, while the pc furin cleaves  <dig> kda rgmc in vitro into a  <dig> kda molecule with an intact nh2-terminus. iron loading reduces release of rgmc from the cell membrane, and diminishes accumulation of the  <dig> kda species in cell culture medium.


CONCLUSIONS
our results define a role for pcs in the maturation of rgmc that may have implications for the physiological actions of this critical iron-regulatory protein.
