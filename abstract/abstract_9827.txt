BACKGROUND
for the development of genome assembly tools, some comprehensive and efficiently computable validation measures are required to assess the quality of the assembly. the mostly used n <dig> measure summarizes the assembly results by the length of the scaffold  overlapping the midpoint of the length-order concatenation of scaffolds . especially for scaffold assemblies it is non-trivial to combine a correctness measure to the n <dig> values, and the current methods for doing this are rather involved.


RESULTS
we propose a simple but rigorous normalized n <dig> assembly metric that combines n <dig> with such a correctness measure; assembly is split into as many parts as necessary to align each part to the reference. for scalability, we first compute maximal local approximate matches between scaffolds and reference in distributed manner, and then proceed with co-linear chaining to find a global alignment. best alignment is removed from the scaffold and the process is iterated with the remaining scaffold content in order to split the scaffold into correctly aligning parts. the proposed normalized n <dig> metric is then the n <dig> value computed for the final correctly aligning parts. as a side result of independent interest, we show how to modify co-linear chaining to restrict gaps to produce a more sensible global alignment.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose and implement a comprehensive and efficient approach to compute a metric that summarizes scaffold assembly correctness and length. our implementation can be downloaded from
