BACKGROUND
the nmb <dig> gene of neisseria meningitidis serogroup b strain mc <dig> encodes the putative nitrogen regulatory protein, iiantr . the homologous protein present in escherichia coli is implicated in the control of nitrogen assimilation. as part of a structural proteomics approach to the study of pathogenic neisseria spp., we have selected this protein for structure determination by x-ray crystallography.


RESULTS
the nm-iiantr was over-expressed in e. coli and was shown to be partially mono-phosphorylated, as assessed by mass spectrometry of the purified protein.

crystals of un-phosphorylated protein were obtained and diffraction data collected to  <dig>  Ã… resolution. the structure of nm-iiantr was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of the e. coli nitrogen regulatory protein iiantr  as the starting model. the overall fold of the neisseria enzyme shows a high degree of similarity to the iiantr from e. coli, and the position of the phosphoryl acceptor histidine residue  is conserved. the orientation of an adjacent arginine residue  suggests that it may also be involved in coordinating the phosphate group. comparison of the structure with that of e. coli iiamtl complexed with hpr  indicates that nm-iiantr binds in a similar way to the hpr-like enzyme in neisseria.


CONCLUSIONS
the structure of nm-iiantr confirms its assignment as a homologue of the iiantr proteins found in a range of other gram-negative bacteria. we conclude that the nm- iiantr protein functions as part of a phosphorylation cascade which, in contrast to e. coli, shares the upstream phosphotransfer protein with the sugar uptake phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system , but in common with e. coli has a distinct downstream effector mechanism.
