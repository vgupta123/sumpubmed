BACKGROUND
genomic data provide a wealth of new information for phylogenetic analysis. yet making use of this data requires phylogenetic methods that can efficiently analyze extremely large data sets and account for processes of gene evolution, such as gene duplication and loss, incomplete lineage sorting , or horizontal gene transfer, that cause incongruence among gene trees. one such approach is gene tree parsimony, which, given a set of gene trees, seeks a species tree that requires the smallest number of evolutionary events to explain the incongruence of the gene trees. however, the only existing algorithms for gene tree parsimony under the duplication-loss or deep coalescence reconciliation cost are prohibitively slow for large datasets.


RESULTS
we describe novel algorithms for spr and tbr based local search heuristics under the duplication-loss cost, and we show how they can be adapted for the deep coalescence cost. these algorithms improve upon the best existing algorithms for these problems by a factor of n, where n is the number of species in the collection of gene trees. we implemented our new spr based local search algorithm for the duplication-loss cost and demonstrate the tremendous improvement in runtime and scalability it provides compared to existing implementations. we also evaluate the performance of our algorithm on three large-scale genomic data sets.


CONCLUSIONS
our new algorithms enable, for the first time, gene tree parsimony analyses of thousands of genes from hundreds of taxa using the duplication-loss and deep coalescence reconciliation costs. thus, this work expands both the size of data sets and the range of evolutionary models that can be incorporated into genome-scale phylogenetic analyses.
