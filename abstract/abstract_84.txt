BACKGROUND
we previously showed that co-immunization with a protein antigen and a dna vaccine coding for the same antigen induces cd40low il-10high tolerogenic dcs, which in turn stimulates the expansion of antigen-specific cd4+cd25-foxp3+ regulatory t cells . however, it was unclear how to choose the antigen sequence to maximize tolerogenic antigen presentation and, consequently, cd25- itreg induction.


RESULTS
in the present study, we demonstrated the requirement of highly antigenic epitopes for cd25- itreg induction. firstly, we showed that the induction of cd25- itreg by tolerogenic dc can be blocked by anti-mhc-ii antibody. next, both the number and the suppressive activity of cd25- itreg correlated positively with the overt antigenicity of an epitope to activate t cells. finally, in a mouse model of dermatitis, highly antigenic epitopes derived from a flea allergen not only induced more cd25- itreg, but also more effectively prevented allergenic reaction to the allergen than did weakly antigenic epitopes.


CONCLUSIONS
our data thus indicate that efficient induction of cd25- itreg requires highly antigenic peptide epitopes. this finding suggests that highly antigenic epitopes should be used for efficient induction of cd25- itreg for clinical applications such as flea allergic dermatitis.
