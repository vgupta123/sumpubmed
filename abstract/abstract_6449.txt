BACKGROUND
giant panda is rare and endangered species endemic to china. the low rates of reproductive success and infectious disease resistance have severely hampered the development of captive and wild populations of the giant panda. the major histocompatibility complex  plays important roles in immune response and reproductive system such as mate choice and mother-fetus bio-compatibility. it is thus essential to understand genetic details of the giant panda mhc. construction of a bacterial artificial chromosome  library will provide a new tool for panda genome physical mapping and thus facilitate understanding of panda mhc genes.


RESULTS
a giant panda bac library consisting of  <dig>  clones has been constructed. the average insert size was calculated to be  <dig> kb based on the examination of  <dig> randomly selected clones, indicating that the giant panda library contained  <dig> -fold genome equivalents. screening of the library with  <dig> giant panda pcr primer pairs revealed  <dig>  positive clones per locus, in good agreement with an expected  <dig> -fold genomic coverage of the library. based on this bac library, we constructed a contig map of the giant panda mhc class ii region from btnl <dig> to daxx spanning about  <dig> kb by a three-step method:  pcr-based screening of the bac library with primers from homologous mhc class ii gene loci, end sequences and bac clone shotgun sequences,  dna sequencing validation of positive clones, and  restriction digest fingerprinting verification of inter-clone overlapping.


CONCLUSIONS
the identifications of genes and genomic regions of interest are greatly favored by the availability of this giant panda bac library. the giant panda bac library thus provides a useful platform for physical mapping, genome sequencing or complex analysis of targeted genomic regions. the  <dig> kb sequence-ready bac contig map of the giant panda mhc class ii region from btnl <dig> to daxx, verified by the three-step method, offers a powerful tool for further studies on the giant panda mhc class ii genes.
