BACKGROUND
the success of tracing cattle to the herd of origin after the detection and confirmation of bovine tuberculosis  lesions in cattle at slaughter is a critical component of the national bovine tb eradication program in the united states . the aims of this study were to 1) quantify the number of bovine tb cases identified at slaughter that were successfully traced to their herd of origin in the u.s. during 2001– <dig>  2) quantify the number of successful traceback investigations that found additional tb infected animals in the herd of origin or epidemiologically linked herds, and 3) describe the forms of animal identification present on domestic bovine tb cases and their association with traceback success.


RESULTS
we analyzed 2001– <dig> data in which  <dig> granulomatous lesions were confirmed as bovine tb. from these  <dig> bovine tb cases,  <dig> adults , and  <dig> fed  were classified as domestic cattle . of these adults and fed cases, 83% and 13% were successfully traced, respectively. of these traceback investigations, 70% of adult cases and 50% of fed cases identified additional bovine tb infected animals in the herd of origin or an epidemiologically linked herd. we found that the presence of various forms of animal identification on domestic bovine tb cases at slaughter may facilitate successful traceback investigations; however, they do not guarantee it.


CONCLUSIONS
these results provide valuable information with regard to epidemiological traceback investigations and serve as a baseline to aid u.s. officials when assessing the impact of newly implemented strategies as part of the national bovine tb eradication in the u.s.
