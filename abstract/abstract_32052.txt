BACKGROUND
in november  <dig>  an anonymous postal survey of sheep farmers in great britain  was conducted to identify factors associated with the flock-level occurrence of scrapie. this survey was undertaken to update an earlier postal survey in  <dig>  and was the first occasion in which a large-scale postal survey had been repeated.


RESULTS
the results of the  <dig> survey indicated that scrapie was more likely to occur in certain geographic regions; in purebred compared to commercial flocks; in larger flocks; in flocks which lambed in group pens compared to those which lambed in individual pens; in flocks which always lambed in the same location compared to those which did not; and in farms which kept certain breeds of sheep. in addition to these factors, the likelihood of the disease occurring in homebred animals was higher in flocks which bred a greater proportion of replacement animals or which bought-in lambs. finally, within-flock transmission following exposure was more likely to occur in hill flocks compared to other farm types; in flocks which bred a greater proportion of replacement animals; and in farms which kept a certain crossbreed of ewe.


CONCLUSIONS
the risk factors identified from the  <dig> and  <dig> anonymous postal surveys in great britain were similar. however, differences between the surveys were identified in the influence of region and of purchasing behaviour on the risk of scrapie. these differences are most likely a consequence of changes in farmer awareness and the impact of the  <dig> foot-and-mouth disease epidemic, respectively.
