BACKGROUND
line-1s  are the most abundant autonomous non-ltr retrotransposons in the human genome and replicate by reverse transcription of an rna intermediate. full-length l <dig> encodes two open reading frames  and orf <dig> has reverse transcriptase activity.


RESULTS
here we expressed human l <dig> rt in e. coli and the purified protein displayed the same rt activity as that of orf2p expressed in insect cells. we tested the effect of different reverse transcriptase inhibitors on l <dig> rt and found that all four tested nucleoside inhibitors efficiently inhibited l <dig> rt activity competitively. the ki values of nrtis were calculated . l <dig> rt was less sensitive to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, among these nevirapine had no effect, even at concentrations up to  <dig> Î¼m. we also examined the effect of rt inhibitors on l <dig> retrotransposition efficiency in vivo using a cell-based retrotransposition assay. similarly, all analog inhibitors decreased l <dig> retrotransposition frequency with different potencies whereas nevirapine had little or no effect on l <dig> retrotransposition. for comparison, we also tested the same inhibitors to highly purified rt of an ltr-retrotransposon  and found it was less sensitive to nrtis than l <dig> rt and has the same inhibition profile as l <dig> rt to nnrtis.


CONCLUSIONS
these data indicate that bacterially expressed l <dig> rt is an active reverse transcriptase sensitive to nucleoside rt inhibitors but not to non-nucleoside inhibitors.
