BACKGROUND
electronic health records aggregated in clinical data warehouses  promise to revolutionize comparative effectiveness research and suggest new avenues of research. however, the effectiveness of cdws is diminished by the lack of properly labeled data. we present a novel approach that integrates knowledge from the cdw, the biomedical literature, and the unified medical language system  to perform high-throughput phenotyping. in this paper, we automatically construct a graphical knowledge model and then use it to phenotype breast cancer patients. we compare the performance of this approach to using metamap when labeling records.


RESULTS
metamap's overall accuracy at identifying breast cancer patients was  <dig> % ; recall= <dig> %, precision= <dig> %, and f1= <dig> %. our unsupervised graph-based high-throughput phenotyping had accuracy of  <dig> %; recall= <dig> %, precision= <dig> %, and f1= <dig> %.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that our approach is a promising alternative for unsupervised high-throughput phenotyping.
