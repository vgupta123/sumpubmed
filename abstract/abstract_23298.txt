BACKGROUND
mirnas regulate multiple genes at the post-transcriptional level and therefore play an important role in many biological processes. it has been suggested that mirna exported outside the cells contribute to inter-cellular communication. consequently, circulating mirnas are of particular interest and are promising biomarkers for many diseases. the number of mirnas annotated in the horse genome is much lower compared to model organisms like human and mouse. we therefore aimed to identify novel equine mirnas for tissue types and breed in serum.


RESULTS
we analysed  <dig> small rna-seq libraries derived from nine tissues  using mirdeep <dig> and mirdentify tools. known mirnas represented between  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the reads in  <dig> libraries. a total of  <dig> novel mirnas were identified. breed and tissue type affected the number of mirnas detected and interestingly, affected its average intensity. a total of  <dig> mirnas in serum proved to be potential biomarkers to differentiate specific breed types, of which mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> were over-expressed and mir- <dig> was under-expressed in ponies compared to warmbloods. the different mirnas profiles, as well as the differences in their expression levels provide a foundation for more hypotheses based on the novel mirnas discovered.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> novel equine mirnas expressed in seven solid tissues, blood and serum. additionally, our approach evidenced that such data supported identification of specific mirnas as markers of functions related to breeds or disease tissues.
