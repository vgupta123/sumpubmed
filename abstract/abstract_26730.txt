BACKGROUND
there is a large amount of inconsistency in gene structure annotations of bacterial strains. this inconsistency is a frustrating impedance to effective comparative genomic analysis of bacterial strains in promising applications such as gaining insights into bacterial drug resistance.


RESULTS
here, we propose camber as an approach to support comparative analysis of multiple bacterial strains. camber produces what we called multigene families. each multigene family reveals genes that are in one-to-one correspondence in the bacterial strains, thereby permitting their annotations to be integrated. we present results of our method applied to three human pathogens: escherichia coli, mycobacterium tuberculosis and staphylococcus aureus.


CONCLUSIONS
as a result, more accurate and more comprehensive annotations of the bacterial strains can be produced.
