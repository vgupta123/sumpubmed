BACKGROUND
rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental and autistic disease caused by mutations of methyl-cpg-binding protein  <dig>  gene. mecp <dig> protein is mainly expressed in neurons and binds to methylated gene promoters to suppress their expression, indicating that rett syndrome is caused by the deregulation of target genes in neurons. however, it is likely that there are more unidentified neuronal mecp2-targets associated with the neurological features of rtt.


RESULTS
using a genome-microarray approach, we found  <dig> genomic regions that contain sites potentially regulated by mecp <dig> based on the features of mecp <dig> binding, dna methylation, and repressive histone modification in human cell lines. within these regions, chromatin immunoprecipitation  analysis revealed that mecp <dig> binds to the upstream regions of the protocadherin genes pcdhb <dig> and pcdh <dig> in human neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cells. pcdhb <dig> and pcdh <dig> promoter activities were down-regulated by mecp <dig>  but not by mbd-deleted mecp <dig>  these gene expression were up-regulated following mecp <dig> reduction with sirna in sh-sy5y cells and in the brains of mecp2-null mice. furthermore, pcdhb <dig> was up-regulated in postmortem brains from rett syndrome patients.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified mecp <dig> target genes that encode neuronal adhesion molecules using chip-on-bac array approach. since these protocadherin genes are generally essential for brain development, aberrant regulation of these molecules may contribute to the pathogenesis of the neurological features observed in rett syndrome.
