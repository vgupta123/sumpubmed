BACKGROUND
cytotoxic drugs are non-selective between normal and pathological tissue, and this poses a challenge regarding the strategy for treatment of tumors. to achieve sufficient antitumor activity for colorectal carcinoma, optimization of the therapeutic regimen is of great importance. we investigated the ability of oxaliplatin long-circulating liposomes  to provide an improved therapeutic index of colorectal carcinoma.


RESULTS
we determined that peg- liposomes conjugated with cells at  <dig> h, with a mean fluorescence intensity that was enhanced upon extended induction time. the peg-liposomal l-ohp induced a significant apoptotic response as compared with free l-ohp,  <dig> % ±  <dig> % vs.  <dig> % ±  <dig> %, respectively. fluorescence imaging with in-vivo imaging demonstrated that peg- liposomes specifically targeted tumour tissue. after intravenous injections of peg-liposomal l-ohp or free l-ohp, the tumour volume suppression ratio was  <dig> % ±  <dig> % and  <dig> % ±  <dig> %, respectively, the percentage increased life span  was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, and bcl- <dig>  bax mrna and protein expression in tumour tissue was  <dig> -fold vs.  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold vs.  <dig> -fold compared with free l-ohp, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the peg-liposomal l-ohp exhibited a tendency to target tumour tissue and demonstrated a significantly greater impact on apoptosis compared to free oxaliplatin.
