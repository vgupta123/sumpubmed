BACKGROUND
serglycin proteoglycans are essential for maturation of secretory granules and for the correct granular storage of cationic proteases in hematopoietic cells, e.g. mast cells. however, little is known about the in vivo functions of serglycin proteoglycans during infection. here we investigated the potential role of serglycin proteoglycans in host defense after infection with the nematode trichinella spiralis.


RESULTS
twelve days post infection lack of serglycin proteoglycans caused significantly increased enteropathy. the serglycin-deficient mice showed significantly increased intestinal worm burden, reduced recruitment of mast cells to the intestinal crypts, decreased levels of the mast cell proteases mcpt <dig> and mcpt <dig> in intestinal tissue, decreased serum levels of tnf-α, il-1β, il- <dig> and il- <dig>  increased levels of il- <dig> and total ige in serum, and increased intestinal levels of the neutrophil markers myeloperoxidase and elastase, as compared to wild type mice. at five weeks post infection, increased larvae burden and inflammation were seen in the muscle tissue of the serglycin-deficient mice.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that the serglycin-deficient mice were more susceptible to t. spiralis infection and displayed an unbalanced immune response compared to wild type mice. these findings point to an essential regulatory role of serglycin proteoglycans in immunity.
