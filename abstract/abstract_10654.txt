BACKGROUND
understanding the function of a particular gene under various stresses is important for engineering plants for broad-spectrum stress tolerance. although virus-induced gene silencing  has been used to characterize genes involved in abiotic stress tolerance, currently available gene silencing and stress imposition methodology at the whole plant level is not suitable for high-throughput functional analyses of genes. this demands a robust and reliable methodology for characterizing genes involved in abiotic and multi-stress tolerance.


RESULTS
our methodology employs vigs-based gene silencing in leaf disks combined with simple stress imposition and effect quantification methodologies for easy and faster characterization of genes involved in abiotic and multi-stress tolerance. by subjecting leaf disks from gene-silenced plants to various abiotic stresses and inoculating silenced plants with various pathogens, we show the involvement of several genes for multi-stress tolerance. in addition, we demonstrate that vigs can be used to characterize genes involved in thermotolerance. our results also showed the functional relevance of nteds <dig> in abiotic stress, nbrbx <dig> and nbctr <dig> in oxidative stress; ntrar <dig> and ntnpr <dig> in salinity stress; nbsos <dig> and nbhsp <dig> in biotic stress; and nteds <dig>  nbetr <dig>  nbwrky <dig> and nbmyc <dig> in thermotolerance.


CONCLUSIONS
in addition to widening the application of vigs, we developed a robust, easy and high-throughput methodology for functional characterization of genes involved in multi-stress tolerance.
