BACKGROUND
a common challenge in bioinformatics is to identify short sub-sequences that are unique in a set of genomes or reference sequences, which can efficiently be achieved by k-mer  counting. however, there are several areas that would benefit from a more stringent definition of “unique”, requiring that these sub-sequences of length w differ by more than k mismatches  from any other sub-sequence, which we term the k-disjoint problem. examples include finding sequences unique to a pathogen for probe-based infection diagnostics; reducing off-target hits for re-sequencing or genome editing; detecting sequence  insertions; and multiple substitution mutations. since both sensitivity and specificity are critical, an exhaustive, yet efficient solution is desirable.


RESULTS
we present microtaboo, a method that allows for efficient and extensive sequence mining of unique  sequences of up to  <dig> nucleotides in length. on a number of simulated and real data sets ranging from microbe- to mammalian-size genomes, we show that microtaboo is able to efficiently find all sub-sequences of a specified length w that do not occur within a threshold of k mismatches in any other sub-sequence. we exemplify that microtaboo has many practical applications, including point substitution detection, sequence insertion detection, padlock probe target search, and candidate crispr target mining.


CONCLUSIONS
microtaboo implements a solution to the k-disjoint problem in an alignment- and assembly free manner. microtaboo is available for windows, mac os x, and linux, running java  <dig> and higher, under the gnu gplv <dig> license, at: https://mohammedaljaff.github.io/microtaboo
