BACKGROUND
microcin j <dig>  is a plasmid-encoded antibiotic peptide produced by escherichia coli . mccj <dig> enters into the sensitive e. coli strains by the outer membrane receptor fhua and the inner membrane proteins tonb, exbb, exbd and sbma. the resistance of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  to mccj <dig> is attributed to the inability of its fhua protein to incorporate the antibiotic into the cell.


RESULTS
in this work we demonstrate that s. typhimurium becomes notably susceptible to mccj <dig> when replicating within macrophages. in order to determine the possible cause of this phenomenon, we studied the sensitivity of s. typhimurium to mccj <dig> at conditions resembling those of the internal macrophage environment, such as low ph, low magnesium and iron deprivation. we observed that the strain was only sensitive to the antibiotic at low ph, leading us to attribute the bacterial sensitization to this condition. a mccj25-resistant e. coli strain in which fhua is deleted was also inhibited by the antibiotic at low ph. then, we could assume that the mccj <dig> sensitivity change observed in both e. coli fhua and s. typhimurium is mediated by a mccj <dig> uptake independent of the fhua receptor. moreover, low ph incubation also sensitized s. typhimurium to the hydrophobic antibiotic novobiocin, which does not affect enteric bacteria viability because it is unable to penetrate the bacterial outer membrane. this observation supports our hypothesis about low ph producing a modification in the bacterial membrane permeability that allows an unspecific mccj <dig> uptake. on the other hand, mccj <dig> inhibited s. typhimurium when cells were preincubated in acidic ph medium and then treated at neutral ph with the antibiotic.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that acidic condition does not alter mccj <dig> hydrophobicity but irreversibly modifies bacterial membrane permeability. this would allow an unspecific antibiotic uptake into the cell.

from our data it is possible to infer that intracellular pathogenic strains, which are in vitro resistant to mccj <dig>  could become susceptible ones in vivo. therefore, the mccj <dig> action spectrum would be broader than what in vitro experiments indicate.
