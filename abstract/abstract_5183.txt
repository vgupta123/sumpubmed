BACKGROUND
schmallenberg virus  emerged in northern-europe in  <dig> resulting in an epidemic of ruminant abortions and congenital malformations throughout the continent. in the years following the epidemic there have been reports of sbv overwintering and continued circulation in several european countries. when the population-level of immunity declines in exposed regions, re-introduction of sbv could result in further outbreaks of schmallenberg disease. the aims of this study were to determine the sbv seroprevalence in previously exposed irish dairy herds in  <dig> and to investigate if sbv continued to circulate in these herds in the three years  following the irish schmallenberg epidemic.

whole-herd sbv serosurveillance was conducted in  <dig> herds before  and following the  <dig> vector-season , and following the  <dig> vector-season . in spring  <dig>   <dig>  blood samples were collected from  <dig>  cows and  <dig>  heifers. in winter  <dig>   <dig>  blood samples were collected from  <dig>  youngstock  and a subsample  of the seronegative animals identified in the spring. youngstock were resampled in winter  <dig>  culicoides spp. were collected in  <dig> herds during the  <dig> vector-season and analysed for sbv; a total of  <dig> pools  from  <dig> sbv vector species were tested for sbv rna using real-time pcr.


RESULTS
in spring  <dig>  animal-level seroprevalence was  <dig>  % . within-herd seroprevalence ranged widely from  <dig>  %– <dig>  % in the  <dig> herds. in winter  <dig>   <dig> animals  originating in  <dig> herds  tested seropositive. in winter  <dig> all youngstock, including the  <dig> seropositive animals in winter  <dig>  tested seronegative suggesting their initial positive result was due to persistence of maternal antibodies. all of the culicoides pools examined tested negative for sbv-rna.


CONCLUSIONS
sbv appears to have recirculated at a very low level in these herds during  <dig> and  <dig>  while there was no evidence of sbv infection in naïve youngstock during  <dig>  a large population of naïve animals was identified and may be at risk of infection in future years should sbv re-emerge and recirculate as it has done in continental europe.
