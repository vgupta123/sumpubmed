BACKGROUND
in the last few years, an increase in imprinting anomalies has been reported in children born from assisted reproductive technology . various clinical and experimental studies also suggest alterations of embryo development after art. therefore, there is a need for studying early epigenetic anomalies which could result from art manipulations, especially on single embryos. in this study, we evaluated the impact of superovulation, in vitro fertilization  and embryo culture conditions on proper genomic imprinting and blastocyst development in single mouse embryos.

in this study, different experimental groups were established to obtain embryos from superovulated and non-superovulated females, either from in vivo or in vitro fertilized oocytes, themselves grown in vitro or not. the embryos were cultured either in m <dig> medium or in g <dig> /g <dig>  sequential medium. the methylation status of h <dig> imprinting control region  and h <dig> promoter was assessed, as well as the gene expression level of h <dig>  in individual blastocysts. in parallel, we have evaluated embryo cleavage kinetics and recorded morphological data.


RESULTS
we show that:

 <dig>  the culture medium influences early embryo development with faster cleavage kinetics for culture in g <dig> /g <dig>  medium compared to m <dig> medium.

 <dig>  epigenetic alterations of the h <dig> icr and h <dig> pp are influenced by the fertilization method since methylation anomalies were observed only in the in vitro fertilized subgroup, however to different degrees according to the culture medium.

 <dig>  superovulation clearly disrupted h <dig> gene expression in individual blastocysts. moreover, when embryos were cultured in vitro after either in vivo or in vitro fertilization, the percentage of blastocysts which expressed h <dig> was higher in g <dig> /g <dig>  medium compared to m <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
compared to previous reports utilizing pools of embryos, our study enables us to emphasize a high individual variability of blastocysts in the h <dig> icr and h <dig> promoter methylation and h <dig> gene expression, with a striking effect of each manipulation associated to art practices. our results suggest that h <dig> could be used as a sensor of the epigenetic disturbance of the utilized techniques.
