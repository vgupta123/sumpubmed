BACKGROUND
the tumor suppressor protein p <dig> is regulated by the ubiquitin ligase mdm <dig> which down-regulates p <dig>  in tumours with overexpressed mdm <dig>  the p53-mdm <dig> interaction can be interrupted by a peptide or small molecule to stabilize p <dig> as a therapeutic strategy. structural and biochemical/mutagenesis data show that p <dig> has  <dig> hydrophobic residues f <dig>  w <dig> and l <dig> that embed into the ligand binding pocket of mdm <dig> which is highly plastic in nature and can modulate its size to accommodate a variety of ligands. this binding pocket is primarily dependent on the orientation of a particular residue, y <dig>  we have studied the role of the dynamics of y <dig> in p <dig> recognition.


RESULTS
molecular dynamics simulations show that the y <dig> side chain can be in "open" or "closed" states with only the former enabling complex formation. when both p <dig> and mdm <dig> are in near native conformations, complex formation is rapid and is driven by the formation of a hydrogen bond between w <dig> of p <dig> and l <dig> of mdm <dig> or by the embedding of f <dig> of p <dig> into mdm <dig>  the transition of y <dig> from "closed" to "open" can increase the size of the binding site. interconversions between these two states can be induced by the n-terminal region of mdm <dig> or by the conformations of the p <dig> peptides.


CONCLUSIONS
molecular dynamics simulations have revealed how the binding of p <dig> to mdm <dig> is modulated by the conformational mobility of y <dig> which is the gatekeeper residue in mdm <dig>  the mobility of this residue can be modulated by the conformations of p <dig> and the nterminal lid region of mdm <dig>
