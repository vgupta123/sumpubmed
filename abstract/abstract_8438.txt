BACKGROUND
necrotic enteritis  caused by netb-positive type a clostridium perfringens is an important bacterial disease of poultry. through its complex regulatory system, c. perfringens orchestrates the expression of a collection of toxins and extracellular enzymes that are crucial for the development of the disease; environmental conditions play an important role in their regulation. in this study, and for the first time, global transcriptomic analysis was performed on ligated intestinal loops in chickens colonized with a netb-positive c. perfringens strain, as well as the same strain propagated in vitro under various nutritional and environmental conditions.


RESULTS
analysis of the respective pathogen transcriptomes revealed up to  <dig> genes that were significantly expressed in vivo. gene expression profiles in vivo were most similar to those of c. perfringens grown in nutritionally-deprived conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our results suggest a bacterial transcriptome responses to the early stages of adaptation, and colonization of, the chicken intestine. our work also reveals how netb-positive c. perfringens reacts to different environmental conditions including those in the chicken intestine.
