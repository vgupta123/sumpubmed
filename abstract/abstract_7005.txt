BACKGROUND
gpr <dig> belongs to the family of adhesion g protein-coupled receptors . a single copy of gpr <dig> was found in many vertebrate genomes. we also identified a drosophila sequence, dmcg <dig>  which shares a common ancestor with the entire group iii of adhesion gpcrs, and also contains ig, lrr and hbd domains which were observed in mammalian gpr <dig> 


RESULTS
we found specific expression of gpr <dig> in cells of the choroid plexus using in situ hybridization and protein-specific antibodies and combined in situ/immunohistochemistry co-localization using cytokeratin, a marker specific for epithelial cells. induction of inflammation by lps did not change gpr <dig> expression. however, gpr <dig> expression was transiently increased  at  <dig> h after traumatic brain injury  followed by a decrease  from  <dig> days onwards in the choroid plexus as well as increased expression  in the hippocampus that was delayed until  <dig> day after injury.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that gpr <dig> plays a functional role in choroidal and hippocampal response to injury.
