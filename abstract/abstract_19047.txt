BACKGROUND
the human oxr <dig> gene belongs to a class of genes with conserved functions that protect cells from reactive oxygen species . the gene was found using a screen of a human cdna library by its ability to suppress the spontaneous mutator phenotype of an e. coli muth nth strain. the function of oxr <dig> is unknown. the human and yeast genes are induced by oxidative stress and targeted to the mitochondria; the yeast gene is required for resistance to hydrogen peroxide. multiple spliced isoforms are expressed in a variety of human tissues, including brain.


RESULTS
in this report, we use a papillation assay that measures spontaneous mutagenesis of an e. coli mutm muty strain, a host defective for oxidative dna repair. papillation frequencies with this strain are dependent upon a g→t transversion in the lacz gene  and are suppressed by in vivo expression of human oxr <dig>  n-terminal, c-terminal and internal deletions of the oxr <dig> gene were constructed and tested for suppression of the mutagenic phenotype of the mutm muty strain. we find that the tldc domain, encoded by the final four exons of the oxr <dig> gene, is not required for papillation suppression in e. coli. instead, we show that the protein segment encoded by exon  <dig> of oxr <dig> is responsible for the suppression of oxidative damage in e. coli.


CONCLUSIONS
the protein segment encoded by oxr <dig> exon  <dig> plays an important role in the anti-oxidative function of the human oxr <dig> protein. this result suggests that the tldc domain, found in oxr <dig> exons 12– <dig> and common in many proteins with nuclear function, has an alternate  role other than oxidative repair.
