BACKGROUND
biolistic transfection is proving an increasingly popular method of incorporating dna or rna into cells that are difficult to transfect using traditional methods. the technique routinely uses 'microparticles', which are ~ <dig> Î¼m diameter projectiles, fired into tissues using pressurised gas. these microparticles are efficient at delivering dna into cells, but cannot efficiently transfect small cells and may cause significant tissue damage, thus limiting their potential usefulness. here we describe the use of  <dig> nm diameter projectiles - nanoparticles - in biolistic transfections to determine if they are a suitable alternative to microparticles.


RESULTS
examination of transfection efficiencies in hek <dig> cells, using a range of conditions including different dna concentrations and different preparation procedures, reveals similar behaviour of microparticles and nanoparticles. the use of nanoparticles, however, resulted in ~30% fewer damaged hek <dig> cells following transfection. biolistic transfection of mouse ear tissue revealed similar depth penetration for the two types of particles, and also showed that < 10% of nuclei were damaged in nanoparticle-transfected samples, compared to > 20% in microparticle-transfected samples. visualising details of small cellular structures was also considerably enhanced when using nanoparticles.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that nanoparticles are as efficient for biolistic transfection as microparticles, and are more appropriate for use in small cells, when examining cellular structures and/or where tissue damage is a problem.
