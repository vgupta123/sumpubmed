BACKGROUND
while increasing data on bacterial evolution in controlled environments are available, our understanding of bacterial genome evolution in natural environments is limited. we thus performed full genome analyses on four listeria monocytogenes, including human and food isolates from both a  <dig> case of sporadic listeriosis and a  <dig> listeriosis outbreak, which had been linked to contaminated food from a single processing facility. all four isolates had been shown to have identical subtypes, suggesting that a specific l. monocytogenes strain persisted in this processing plant over at least  <dig> years. while a genome sequence for the  <dig> food isolate has been reported, we sequenced the genomes of the  <dig> human isolate as well as a human and a food isolate from the  <dig> outbreak to allow for comparative genome analyses.


RESULTS
the two l. monocytogenes isolates from  <dig> and the two isolates from  <dig> had highly similar genome backbone sequences with very few single nucleotide  polymorphisms . while no genome rearrangements were identified in the backbone genome of the four isolates, a  <dig> kb prophage inserted in the chromosomal comk gene showed evidence for major genome rearrangements. the human-food isolate pair from each  <dig> and  <dig> had identical prophage sequence; however, there were significant differences in the prophage sequences between the  <dig> and  <dig> isolates. diversification of this prophage appears to have been caused by multiple homologous recombination events or possibly prophage replacement. in addition, only the  <dig> human isolate contained a plasmid, suggesting plasmid loss or acquisition events. surprisingly, besides the polymorphisms found in the comk prophage, a single snp in the trna thr- <dig> prophage represents the only snp that differentiates the  <dig> isolates from the  <dig> isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
our data support the hypothesis that the  <dig> human listeriosis outbreak was caused by a l. monocytogenes strain that persisted in a food processing facility over  <dig> years and show that genome sequencing is a valuable and feasible tool for retrospective epidemiological analyses. short-term evolution of l. monocytogenes in non-controlled environments appears to involve limited diversification beyond plasmid gain or loss and prophage diversification, highlighting the importance of phages in bacterial evolution.
