BACKGROUND
we have recently demonstrated that all-trans-retinoic acid  and 9-cis-retinoic acid  promote il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> synthesis, while decreasing ifn-γ and tnf-α expression by activated human t cells and reduces the synthesis of il-12p <dig> from accessory cells. here, we have demonstrated that the observed effects using atra and 9-cis ra are shared with the clinically useful rar ligand, 13-cis retinoic acid , and the retinoic acid receptor-α -selective agonist, am <dig> but not with the rar-β/γ ligand, 4-hydroxyphenylretinamide .


RESULTS
the increase in type  <dig> cytokine production by these retinoids correlated with the expression of the t cell activation markers, cd <dig> and cd <dig>  the rar-α-selective agonist, am <dig> recapitulated all of the t cell activation and type  <dig> cytokine-inducing effects of atra and 9-cis-ra, while the rar-α-selective antagonist, ro 41– <dig>  inhibited these effects.


CONCLUSIONS
these results strongly support a role for rar-α engagement in the regulation of genes and proteins involved with human t cell activation and type  <dig> cytokine production.
