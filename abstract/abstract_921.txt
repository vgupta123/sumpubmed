BACKGROUND
plants may adapt to alpine habitats by specialization in the reproductive strategy and functional aspects of their flowers and pollination systems. alpine habitats reduce the opportunities for cross-pollination in a relatively high proportion of alpine plant species, and self-pollination may be favored in these adverse conditions. here, we investigated the mating system and pollination of incarvillea mairei, a perennial himalayan herb typically found at altitudes between  <dig> and 4500Â m.


RESULTS
analyses of floral morphology, observation of plant-pollinator interactions, and hand pollination experiments were conducted in three natural populations. outcrossing rates and effective numbers of pollen donors were assessed in  <dig> open-pollinated families by using progeny analysis based on seven microsatellite markers. incarvillea mairei displayed a set of apparently specialized floral traits, the stigma is sensitive to touch and close immediately and its reopening allows a second opportunity for the receipt of pollen. the species is fully self-compatible but employs a predominantly outcrossing mating system according to parentage analysis . fruit set was low , whereas seed set was high , indicating that this species suffers pollinator limitation. its main effective pollinator was halictus sp., and visitation frequency was low.


CONCLUSIONS
floral features such as having a sensitive stigma and anther-prongs, in conjunction with pollinator behavior, function together contributing to a set of unique reproductive adaptations that enhance outcrossing success. the increased floral longevity and high pollination efficiency operated as compensatory mechanisms to counteract low pollinator visitation frequency.
