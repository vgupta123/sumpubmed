BACKGROUND
clic <dig> is a chloride channel whose cellular role remains uncertain. the distribution of clic <dig> in normal tissues is largely unknown and conflicting data have been reported regarding the cellular membrane fraction in which clic <dig> resides.


RESULTS
new antisera to clic <dig> were generated and were found to be sensitive and specific for detecting this protein. these antisera were used to investigate the distribution of clic <dig> in mouse tissue sections and three cultured cell lines. we find clic <dig> is expressed in the apical domains of several simple columnar epithelia including glandular stomach, small intestine, colon, bile ducts, pancreatic ducts, airway, and the tail of the epididymis, in addition to the previously reported renal proximal tubule. clic <dig> is expressed in a non-polarized distribution in the basal epithelial cell layer of the stratified squamous epithelium of the upper gastrointesitinal tract and the basal cells of the epididymis, and is present diffusely in skeletal muscle. distribution of clic <dig> was examined in panc <dig> cells, a relatively undifferentiated, non-polarized human cell line derived from pancreatic cancer, and t <dig> cells, a human colon cancer cell line which can form a polarized epithelium that is capable of regulated chloride transport. digitonin extraction was used to distinguish membrane-inserted clic <dig> from the soluble cytoplasmic form of the protein. we find that digitonin-resistant clic <dig> is primarily present in the plasma membrane of panc <dig> cells. in t <dig> cells, we find digitonin-resistant clic <dig> is present in an intracellular compartment which is concentrated immediately below the apical plasma membrane and the extent of apical polarization is enhanced with forskolin, which activates transepithelial chloride transport and apical membrane traffic in these cells. the sub-apical clic <dig> compartment was further characterized in a well-differentiated mouse renal proximal tubule cell line. the distribution of clic <dig> was found to overlap that of megalin and the sodium-phosphate cotransporter, napi-ii, which are markers of the apical endocytic/recycling compartment in proximal tubule.


CONCLUSIONS
the cell and tissue specific patterns of clic <dig> expression suggest it may play distinct roles in different cell types. in certain polarized columnar epithelia, it may play a role in apical membrane recycling.
