BACKGROUND
the lim-homeodomain transcription factors lhx <dig> and lhx <dig> have been implicated in palatogenesis in mice and thus may also contribute to the incidence of isolated palatal clefts and/or clefts of the lip and primary palate  in humans. causative mutations in the transcription factor irf <dig> have also been identified in two allelic cl/p syndromes and common polymorphisms in the same gene are significantly associated with non-syndromal cl/p in different populations.


RESULTS
here we report the isolation of chick orthologues of lhx <dig>  lhx <dig> and irf <dig> and the first characterisation of their profiles of expression during morphogenesis of the midface with emphasis on the period around formation of the primary palate. lhx <dig> and lhx <dig> expression was restricted to the ectomesenchyme immediately underlying the ectoderm of the maxillary and mandibular primordia as well as to the lateral globular projections of the medial nasal process, again underlying the pre-fusion primary palatal epithelia. in contrast, irf <dig> expression was restricted to surface epithelia, with elevated levels around the frontonasal process, the maxillary primordia, and the nasal pits. elsewhere, high expression was also evident in the egg tooth primordium and in the apical ectodermal ridge of the developing limbs.


CONCLUSIONS
the restricted expression of both lhx genes and irf <dig> in the facial primordia suggests roles for these gene products in promoting directed outgrowth and fusion of the primary palate. the manipulability, minimal cost and susceptibility of chicks to cl/p will enable more detailed investigations into how perturbations of irf <dig>  lhx <dig> and lhx <dig> contribute to common orofacial clefts.
