BACKGROUND
approximately  <dig> mb of finished high quality genomic sequences were sampled from cattle, dog and human to estimate genomic divergences and their regional variation among these lineages.


RESULTS
optimal three-way multi-species global sequence alignments for  <dig> cattle clones or loci  were constructed using the human and dog genome assemblies as references. genomic divergences and substitution rates were examined for each clone and for various sequence classes under different functional constraints. analysis of these alignments revealed that the overall genomic divergences are relatively constant  for pairwise comparisons among cattle, dog and human; however substitution rates vary across genomic regions and among different sequence classes. a neutral mutation rate  change/site/year) was derived from ancestral repetitive sequences, whereas the substitution rate in coding sequences  change/site/year) was approximately half of the overall rate  change/site/year). relative rate tests also indicated that cattle have a significantly faster rate of substitution as compared to dog and that this difference is about 6%.


CONCLUSIONS
this analysis provides a large-scale and unbiased assessment of genomic divergences and regional variation of substitution rates among cattle, dog and human. it is expected that these data will serve as a baseline for future mammalian molecular evolution studies.
