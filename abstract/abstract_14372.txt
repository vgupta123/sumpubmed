BACKGROUND
bacteriophages infecting lactic acid bacteria  are widely acknowledged as the main cause of milk fermentation failures. in this study, we describe the surface-expression as well as the secretion of two functional llama heavy-chain antibody fragments, one binding to the major capsid protein  and the other to the receptor-binding proteins  of the lactococcal bacteriophage p <dig>  by lactobacilli in order to neutralise lactococcal phages.


RESULTS
the antibody fragment vhh <dig> that is directed against the rbp, was fused to a c-myc tag and expressed in a secreted form by a lactobacillus strain. the fragment vhh <dig> that is binding to the mcp, was fused to an e-tag and anchored on the surface of the lactobacilli. surface expression of vhh <dig> was confirmed by flow cytometry using an anti-e-tag antibody. efficient binding of both the vhh <dig> and the secreted vhh <dig> fragment to the phage antigens was shown in elisa. scanning electron microscopy showed that lactobacilli expressing vhh <dig> anchored at their surface were able to bind lactococcal phages. a neutralisation assay also confirmed that the secreted vhh <dig> and the anchored vhh <dig> fragments prevented the adsorption of lactococcal phages to their host cells.


CONCLUSIONS
lactobacilli were able to express functional vhh fragments in both a secreted and a cell surface form and reduced phage infection of lactococcal cells. lactobacilli expressing llama heavy-chain antibody fragments represent a novel way to limit phage infection.
