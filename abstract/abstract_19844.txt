BACKGROUND
the thermostable β-glucosidase  from thermotoga neapolitana is a promising biocatalyst for hydrolysis of glucosylated flavonoids and can be coupled to extraction methods using pressurized hot water. hydrolysis has however been shown to be dependent on the position of the glucosylation on the flavonoid, and e.g. quercetin-3-glucoside  was hydrolysed slowly. a set of mutants of tnbgl1a were thus created to analyse the influence on the kinetic parameters using the model substrate para-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside , and screened for hydrolysis of q <dig> 


RESULTS
structural analysis pinpointed an area in the active site pocket with non-conserved residues between specificity groups in glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> . three residues in this area located on β-strand  <dig>  close to sugar binding sub-site + <dig> were selected for mutagenesis and amplified in a protocol that introduced a few spontaneous mutations. eight mutants  were produced in e. coli, and purified to apparent homogeneity. thermostability, measured as tm by differential scanning calorimetry , was kept in the mutated variants and significant decrease  was only observed for the triple mutants. the exchanged residue in the respective mutant resulted in variations in km and turnover. the km-value was only changed in variants mutated at position  <dig>  and was in all cases monitored as a 2- <dig> × increase for pnpglc, while the km decreased a corresponding extent for q <dig> 

turnover was only significantly changed using pnpglc, and was decreased 2- <dig> × in variants mutated at position  <dig>  while the single, double and triple mutated variants carrying a mutation at position  <dig>  increased turnover up to  <dig>  × compared to the wild type. modelling showed that the mutation at position  <dig>  may alter the position of n <dig> resulting in increased hydrogen bonding of q <dig>  which may explain the decrease in km for this substrate.


CONCLUSIONS
these results show that residues at the + <dig> subsite are interesting targets for mutagenesis and mutations at these positions can directly or indirectly affect both km and turnover. an affinity change, leading to a decreased km, can be explained by an altered position of n <dig>  while the changes in turnover are more difficult to explain and may be the result of smaller conformational changes in the active site.
