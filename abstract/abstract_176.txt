BACKGROUND
costimulation of t cells via costimulatory molecules such as b <dig> is important for eliciting cell-mediated antitumor immunity. presenting costimulation molecules by immobilizing recombinant b <dig> on the surface of nanovectors is a novel strategy for complementary therapy. polyhydroxyalkanoates  are a family of biodegradable, non-toxic, biocompatible polyesters, which can be used as a nonspecific immobilizing matrix for protein presentation. recombinant protein fusion with pha granule binding protein phasin  can be easily immobilized on the surface of pha nanoparticles through hydrophobic interactions between phap and pha, and therefore provides a low-cost protein presenting strategy.


RESULTS
in this study, the extracellular domain of the b7- <dig> molecule  was fused with phap at its n-terminal and heterogeneously expressed in recombinant escherichia coli strain bl <dig> . the purified b7-2-phap protein was immobilized on the surface of poly -based nanoparticles. loading of  <dig> Î¼g  of b7-2-phap protein per mg nanoparticles was achieved. immobilized b7-2-phap on phbhhx nanoparticles induced t cell activation and proliferation in vitro.


CONCLUSIONS
a pha nanoparticle-based b7- <dig> costimulation molecule-presenting system was constructed. the pha-based b <dig> presenting nanosystem provided costimulation signals to induce t cell activation and expansion in vitro. the b7-2-phap immobilized pha nanosystem is a novel strategy for costimulation molecule presentation and may be used for costimulatory molecule complementary therapy.
