BACKGROUND
physical exercise improves functional recovery after stroke through a complex mechanism that is not fully understood. transient focal cerebral ischemia induces autophagy, apoptosis and neurogenesis in the peri-infarct region. this study is aimed to examine the effects of physical exercise on autophagy, apoptosis and neurogenesis in the peri-infarct region in a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion .


RESULTS
we found that autophagosomes, as labeled by microtubule-associated protein 1a light chain 3-ii , were evident in the peri-infarct region at  <dig> days after 90-minute mcao. moreover,  <dig> % of lc3-positive cells were also stained with tunel. the number of lc <dig> positive cells was significantly lower in physical exercise group than in control group at  <dig> and  <dig> days after mcao. suppression of autophagosomes by physical exercise was positively associated with improvement of neurological function. in addition, physical exercise significantly decreased the number of tunel-positive cells and increased the numbers of ki67-positive, a proliferative marker, and insulin-like growth factor- <dig>  positive cells at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days after mcao.


CONCLUSIONS
the present results demonstrate that physical exercise enhances neurological function possibly by reduction of autophagosome accumulation, attenuation of apoptosis and enhancement of neurogenesis in the peri-infarct region after transient mcao in rats.
