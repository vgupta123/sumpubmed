BACKGROUND
douglas-fir , one of the most economically and ecologically important tree species in the world, also has one of the largest tree breeding programs. although the coastal and interior varieties of douglas-fir  are native to north america, the coastal variety is also widely planted for timber production in europe, new zealand, australia, and chile. our main goal was to develop a snp resource large enough to facilitate genomic selection in douglas-fir breeding programs. to accomplish this, we developed a 454-based reference transcriptome for coastal douglas-fir, annotated and evaluated the quality of the reference, identified putative snps, and then validated a sample of those snps using the illumina infinium genotyping platform.


RESULTS
we assembled a reference transcriptome consisting of  <dig>  isogroups  and  <dig>  singletons from  <dig>  million  <dig> and sanger cdna sequences from coastal douglas-fir. we identified  <dig>  unique snps by mapping the  <dig> and sanger sequences to the reference, and by mapping four datasets of illumina cdna sequences from multiple seed sources, genotypes, and tissues. the illumina datasets represented coastal douglas-fir , interior douglas-fir , and a yakima population similar to interior douglas-fir . we assayed  <dig> snps on  <dig> trees using an illumina infinium snp genotyping array. of these snps,  <dig>  were called successfully and were polymorphic.


CONCLUSIONS
based on our validation efficiency, our snp database may contain as many as ~ <dig>  true snps, and as many as ~ <dig>  snps that could be genotyped at ~ <dig>  gene loci using an infinium ii arrayâ€”more snps than are needed to use genomic selection in tree breeding programs. ultimately, these genomic resources will enhance douglas-fir breeding and allow us to better understand landscape-scale patterns of genetic variation and potential responses to climate change.
