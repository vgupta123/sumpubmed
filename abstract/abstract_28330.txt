BACKGROUND
chemokines, a group of small and structurally related proteins, mediate chemotaxis of various cell types via chemokine receptors. in mammals, seven different cxc chemokine receptors denoted as cxcr <dig> to cxcr <dig> have been reported. however, the chemokine receptor cxcr <dig> has not been reported in other vertebrates.


RESULTS
in the present study, the genomic sequence of cxcr <dig> was isolated from the grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella. the cdna sequence of grass carp cxcr <dig>  consists of  <dig> bp with a  <dig> bp 5' untranslated region  and a  <dig> bp 3' utr, with an open reading frame of  <dig> bp encoding  <dig> amino acids which are predicted to have seven transmembrane helices. the characteristic residues  and conserved cysteine residues are located in the extracellular regions and in the third to seventh transmembrane domains. the deduced amino acid sequence shows  <dig> - <dig> % identities with cxcr <dig> of mammals, avian and other fish species. the grass carp gene consists of two exons, with one intervening intron, spaced over  <dig> bp of genomic sequence. phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrated that the gccxcr <dig> is clustered with those in other teleost fish and then in chicken and mammals. real-time pcr analysis showed that gccxcr <dig> was expressed in all tested organs/tissues and its expression level was the highest in trunk kidney, followed by in the spleen. the expression of gccxcr <dig> was significantly modulated by immunostimulants such as peptidoglycan , lipopolysaccharide , polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid sodium salt  and phytohaemagglutinin .


CONCLUSIONS
the cdna and genomic sequences of cxcr <dig> have been successfully characterized in a teleost fish, the grass carp. the cxcr <dig> has in general a constitutive expression in organs/tissues examined, whereas its expression was significantly up-regulated in immune organs and down-regulated in brain, indicating its potential role in immune response and central nervous system.
