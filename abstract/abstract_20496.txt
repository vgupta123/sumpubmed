BACKGROUND
in the last decade, biochemical studies have revealed that epigenetic modifications including histone modifications, histone variants and dna methylation form a complex network that regulate the state of chromatin and processes that depend on it including transcription and dna replication. currently, a large number of these epigenetic modifications are being mapped in a variety of cell lines at different stages of development using high throughput sequencing by members of the encode consortium, the nih roadmap epigenomics program and the human epigenome project. an extremely promising and underexplored area of research is the application of machine learning methods, which are designed to construct predictive network models, to these large-scale epigenomic data sets.


RESULTS
using a chip-seq data set of  <dig> histone lysine and arginine methylations and histone variant h2a.z in human cd4+ t-cells, we built predictive models of gene expression as a function of histone modification/variant levels using multilinear  regression and multivariate adaptive regression splines . along with extensive crosstalk among the  <dig> histone methylations, we found h4r3me <dig> was the most and second most globally repressive histone methylation among the  <dig> studied in the ml and mars models, respectively. in support of our finding, a number of experimental studies show that prmt5-catalyzed symmetric dimethylation of h4r <dig> is associated with repression of gene expression. this includes a recent study, which demonstrated that h4r3me <dig> is required for dnmt3a-mediated dna methylation--a known global repressor of gene expression.


CONCLUSIONS
in stark contrast to univariate analysis of the relationship between h4r3me <dig> and gene expression levels, our study showed that the regulatory role of some modifications like h4r3me <dig> is masked by confounding variables, but can be elucidated by multivariate/systems-level approaches.
