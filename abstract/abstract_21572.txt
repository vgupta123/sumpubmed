BACKGROUND
actinomycetes have provided a wealth of bioactive secondary metabolites with interesting activities such as antimicrobial, antiviral and anticancer. the study aims at isolation, characterization and the antimicrobial potentiality of streptomyces sannanensis su <dig> obtained from phoomdi, a unique habitat of loktak lake of manipur, india.


RESULTS
an actinomycete strain isolated from phoomdi soil of loktak lake of manipur, india was identified as streptomyces sannanensis su <dig>  it is a gram-positive filamentous bacterium which exhibits antimicrobial activity only against gram-positive bacteria, while gram-negative organisms were not affected. glucose soyabean meal broth was found to be the suitable medium for antibiotic production at 28°c for seven days of incubation. the antimicrobial agent produced by the strain was extracted with ethyl acetate as solvent and purified by thin layer chromatography. screening and bioassay - guided fractionation of the ethyl acetate extract from the culture filtrate led to the isolation of an active potential compound  with λmax  <dig>  nm which has got the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration  against staphylococcus aureus mtcc  <dig> and staphylococcus aureus , whereas highest  was recorded against mycobacterium smegmatis mtcc  <dig> and bacillus circulans mtcc  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this study has therefore uncovered the potential of exploring virgin untapped habitats in the indo-burma biodiversity hot spot region as reservoir of promising antimicrobial metabolite producer. these results highlighted the scope for further characterization of the metabolite and could be a candidate in the generation of new antimicrobial agents.
