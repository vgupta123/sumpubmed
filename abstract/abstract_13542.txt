BACKGROUND
micrornas  play important roles in embryonic stem cell  self-renewal and pluripotency. numerous studies have revealed human and mouse esc mirna profiles. as a model for human-related study, the rhesus macaque is ideal for delineating the regulatory mechanisms of mirnas in escs. however, studies on rhesus macaque escs are lacking due to limited resc availability and a need for systematic analyses of fundamental resc characteristics.


RESULTS
we established three resc lines and profiled microrna using solexa sequencing resulting in  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas. mirna profiles were highly conserved between resc lines and predicted target genes were significantly enriched in differentiation pathways. further analysis of the mirna-target network indicated that gene expression regulated by mirnas was negatively correlated to their evolutionary rate in rescs. moreover, a cross-species comparison revealed an overall conservation of mirna expression patterns between human, mouse and rhesus macaque escs. however, we identified three mirna clusters  that showed clear interspecies differences.


CONCLUSIONS
rescs share a unique mirna set that may play critical roles in self-renewal and pluripotency. mirna expression patterns are generally conserved between species. however, species and/or lineage specific mirna regulation changed during evolution.
