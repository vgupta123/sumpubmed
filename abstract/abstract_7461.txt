BACKGROUND
the identification and characterization of the transcriptional regulatory networks governing the physiology and adaptation of microbial cells is a key step in understanding their behaviour. one such wide-domain regulatory circuit, essential to all cells, is carbon catabolite repression : it allows the cell to prefer some carbon sources, whose assimilation is of high nutritional value, over less profitable ones. in lower multicellular fungi, the c2h <dig> zinc finger crea/cre <dig> protein has been shown to act as the transcriptional repressor in this process. however, the complete list of its gene targets is not known.


RESULTS
here, we deciphered the cre <dig> regulatory range in the model cellulose and hemicellulose-degrading fungus trichoderma reesei  by profiling transcription in a wild-type and a delta-cre <dig> mutant strain on glucose at constant growth rates known to repress and de-repress ccr-affected genes. analysis of genome-wide microarrays reveals  <dig> % of transcripts whose expression was regulated in at least one of the four experimental conditions:  <dig> % of which were repressed by cre <dig>  whereas  <dig> % were actually induced by cre <dig>  and  <dig> % only affected by the growth rate but cre <dig> independent. among cre <dig> repressed transcripts, genes encoding unknown proteins and transport proteins were overrepresented. in addition, we found cre1-repression of nitrogenous substances uptake, components of chromatin remodeling and the transcriptional mediator complex, as well as developmental processes.


CONCLUSIONS
our study provides the first global insight into the molecular physiological response of a multicellular fungus to carbon catabolite regulation and identifies several not yet known targets in a growth-controlled environment.
