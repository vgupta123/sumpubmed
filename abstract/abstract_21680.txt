BACKGROUND
proton magnetic resonance  spectroscopy  is a widely available technique for those clinical centres equipped with mr scanners. unlike the rest of mr-based techniques, mrs yields not images but spectra of metabolites in the tissues. in pathological situations, the mrs profile changes and this has been particularly described for brain tumours. however, radiologists are frequently not familiar to the interpretation of mrs data and for this reason, the usefulness of decision-support systems  in mrs data analysis has been explored.


RESULTS
this work presents the interpret dss version  <dig> , analysing the improvements made from its first release in  <dig>  version  <dig>  is aimed to be a program that 1st, can be easily used with any new case from any mr scanner manufacturer and 2nd, improves the initial analysis capabilities of the first version. the main improvements are an embedded database, user accounts, more diagnostic discrimination capabilities and the possibility to analyse data acquired under additional data acquisition conditions. other improvements include a customisable graphical user interface . most diagnostic problems included have been addressed through a pattern-recognition based approach, in which classifiers based on linear discriminant analysis  were trained and tested.


CONCLUSIONS
the interpret dss  <dig>  allows radiologists, medical physicists, biochemists or, generally speaking, any person with a minimum knowledge of what an mr spectrum is, to enter their own sv raw data, acquired at  <dig>  t, and to analyse them. the system is expected to help in the categorisation of mr spectra from abnormal brain masses.
