BACKGROUND
many high throughput sequencing  approaches, such as the roche/ <dig> platform, produce sequences in which the quality of the sequence  decreases linearly across a sequence read. undertaking quality trimming of this data is essential to enable confidence in the results of subsequent downstream analysis. here, we have developed a novel, highly sensitive and accurate approach  for the quality trimming of sequence reads generated using the roche/ <dig> sequencing platform .


RESULTS
the performance of qtrim was evaluated against all other available quality trimming approaches on both poor and high quality  <dig> sequence data. in all cases, qtrim appears to perform equally as well as the best other approach  with these two methods significantly outperforming all other methods. further analysis of the trimmed data revealed that the novel trimming approach implemented in qtrim ensures that the prevalence of low quality bases in the resulting trimmed data is substantially lower than prinseq or any of the other approaches tested.


CONCLUSIONS
qtrim is a novel, highly sensitive and accurate algorithm for the quality trimming of roche/ <dig> sequence reads. it is implemented both as an executable program that can be integrated with standalone sequence analysis pipelines and as a web-based application to enable individuals with little or no bioinformatics experience to quality trim their sequence data.
