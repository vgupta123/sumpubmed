BACKGROUND
intrinsic protein disorder is becoming an increasingly important topic in protein science. during the last few years, intrinsically disordered proteins  have been shown to play a role in many important biological processes, e.g. protein signalling and regulation. this has sparked a need to better understand and characterize different types of idps, their functions and roles. our recently published database, mobidb, provides a centralized resource for accessing and analysing intrinsic protein disorder annotations.


RESULTS
here, we present a thorough description and analysis of the data made available by mobidb, providing descriptive statistics on the various available annotation sources. version  <dig> . <dig> of the database contains annotations for ca.  <dig> , <dig> uniprot sequences, covering all eukaryotic proteomes. in addition, we describe a novel consensus annotation calculation and its related weighting scheme. the comparison between disorder information sources highlights how the mobidb consensus captures the main features of intrinsic disorder and correlates well with manually curated datasets. finally, we demonstrate the annotation of  <dig> eukaryotic model organisms through mobidb's datasets, and of an example protein through the interactive user interface.


CONCLUSIONS
mobidb is a central resource for intrinsic disorder research, containing both experimental data and predictions. in the future it will be expanded to include additional information for all known proteins.
