BACKGROUND
biosecurity measures such as cleaning, disinfection and a vacancy period between production cycles on pig farms are essential to prevent disease outbreaks. no studies have tested the effect of a longer vacancy period on bacterial load in nursery units.

methods
the present study evaluated the effect of a 10-day vacancy period in pig nursery units on total aerobic flora, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, faecal coliforms and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus . three vacancy periods of 10 days were monitored, each time applied in  <dig> units. the microbiological load was measured before disinfection and at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 10 days after disinfection.


RESULTS
no significant decrease or increase in e. coli, faecal coliforms, mrsa and enterococcus spp. was noticed. total aerobic flora counts were the lowest on day  <dig> after disinfection  , but the difference with other sampling moments was limited  and therefore negligible. furthermore, this observation on day  <dig> was not confirmed for the other microbiological parameters. after disinfection, drinking nipples were still mostly contaminated with total aerobic flora  and enterococcus spp.  ; the feeding troughs were the cleanest location  .


CONCLUSIONS
this study indicates that prolonging the vacancy period in nursery units to 10 days after disinfection with no extra biosecurity measures has no impact on the environmental load of total aerobic flora, e. coli, faecal coliforms, mrsa and enterococcus spp..
