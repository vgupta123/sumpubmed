BACKGROUND
maize rough dwarf disease  is a devastating viral disease that results in considerable yield losses worldwide. three major strains of virus cause mrdd, including maize rough dwarf virus in europe, mal de río cuarto virus in south america, and rice black-streaked dwarf virus in east asia. these viral pathogens belong to the genus fijivirus in the family reoviridae. resistance against mrdd is a complex trait that involves a number of quantitative trait loci . the primary approach used to minimize yield losses from these viruses is to breed and deploy resistant maize hybrids.


RESULTS
of the  <dig> heterogeneous inbred families ,  <dig> showed consistent responses to mrdd across different years and locations, in which  <dig> were resistant and  <dig> were susceptible. we performed trait-marker association analysis on the  <dig> hifs and found six chromosomal regions which were putatively associated with mrdd resistance. we then conducted qtl analysis and detected a major resistance qtl, qmrdd <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  by applying recombinant-derived progeny testing to self-pollinated backcrossed families, we fine-mapped the qmrdd <dig> locus into a  <dig> -mb region flanked by markers m103- <dig> and m105- <dig>  the qmrdd <dig> locus acted in a recessive manner to reduce the disease-severity index  by  <dig> – <dig> %. the genetic effect of qmrdd <dig> was validated using another f <dig> recombinant inbred line  population in which mrdd resistance was segregating and two genotypes at the qmrdd <dig> locus differed significantly in dsi values.


CONCLUSIONS
the qmrdd <dig> locus is a major resistance qtl, acting in a recessive manner to increase maize resistance to mrdd. we mapped qmrdd <dig> to a  <dig> -mb region, which will enable the introgression of qmrdd1-based resistance into elite maize hybrids and reduce mrdd-related crop losses.
