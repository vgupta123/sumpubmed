BACKGROUND
a subset of breast cancer cells displays increased ability to self-renew and reproduce breast cancer heterogeneity. the characterization of these so-called putative breast tumor-initiating cells  may open the road for novel therapeutic strategies. as micrornas  control developmental programs in stem cells, bt-ics may also rely on specific mirna profiles for their sustained activity. to explore the notion that mirnas may have a role in sustaining bt-ics, we performed a comprehensive profiling of mirna expression in a model of putative bt-ics enriched by non-attachment growth conditions.


RESULTS
we found breast cancer cells grown under non-attachment conditions display a unique pattern of mirna expression, highlighted by a marked low expression of mir- <dig> family members relative to parental cells. we further show that mir-30a regulates non-attachment growth. a target screening revealed that mir- <dig> family redundantly modulates the expression of apoptosis and proliferation-related genes. at least one of these targets, the anti-apoptotic protein aven, was able to partially revert the effect of mir-30a overexpression. finally, overexpression of mir-30a in vivo was associated with reduced breast tumor progression.


CONCLUSIONS
mir30-family regulates the growth of breast cancer cells in non-attachment conditions. this is the first analysis of target prediction in a whole family of micrornas potentially involved in survival of putative bt-ics.
