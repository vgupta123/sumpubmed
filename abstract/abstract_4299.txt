BACKGROUND
control of translation allows for rapid adaptation of the cell to stimuli, rather than the slower transcriptional control. we presume that translational control is an essential process in the control of adipogenesis, especially in the first hours after hormonal stimulation. 3t3-l <dig> preadipocytes were cultured to confluency and adipogenesis was induced by standard protocols using a hormonal cocktail. cells were harvested before and  <dig> hours after hormonal induction. mrnas attached to ribosomes  were separated from unbound mrnas by velocity sedimentation. pools of polysomal and unbound mrna fractions were analyzed by microarray analysis. changes in relative abundance in unbound and polysomal mrna pools were calculated to detect putative changes in translational activity. changes of expression levels of selected genes were verified by qpcr and western blotting.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> genes that shifted towards the polysomal fraction  and  <dig> genes that shifted towards free mrna fraction . interestingly, we found ghrelin to be down-regulated. up-regulated genes comprise factors that are nucleic acid binding , form part of ribosomes , act on the regulation of translation  or transcription . others act as chaperones  or in other metabolic or signals transducing processes.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that a moderate reorganisation of the functionality of the ribosomal machinery and translational activity are very important steps for growth and gene expression control in the initial phase of adipogenesis.
