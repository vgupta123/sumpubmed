BACKGROUND
mirnas and phasirnas are negative regulators of gene expression. these small rnas have been extensively studied in plant model species but only  <dig> mature micrornas are present in mirbase version  <dig>  the most used mirna database, and no phasirnas have been identified for the model legume phaseolus vulgaris. thanks to the recent availability of the first version of the common bean genome, degradome data and small rna libraries, we are able to present here a catalog of the micrornas and phasirnas for this organism and, particularly, we suggest new protagonists in the symbiotic nodulation events.


RESULTS
we identified a set of  <dig> mature mirnas, including  <dig> previously unpublished sequences, encoded by  <dig> precursors and distributed in  <dig> families. degradome data allowed us to identify a total of  <dig> targets for these mirnas. we reveal two regulatory networks involving conserved mirnas: those known to play crucial roles in the establishment of nodules, and novel mirnas present only in common bean, suggesting a specific role for these sequences. in addition, we identified  <dig> loci that potentially produce phased small rnas, with  <dig> of them having all the characteristics of being triggered by a total of  <dig> mirnas, including  <dig> new mirnas identified in this study.


CONCLUSIONS
we provide here a set of new small rnas that contribute to the broader knowledge of the srnaome of phaseolus vulgaris. thanks to the identification of the mirna targets from degradome analysis and the construction of regulatory networks between the mature micrornas, we present here the probable functional regulation associated with the srnaome and, particularly, in n2-fixing symbiotic nodules.
