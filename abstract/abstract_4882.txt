BACKGROUND
bacterial blight, caused by xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae , is a devastating rice disease worldwide. xa <dig> is a resistance  gene with a broad-spectrum hypersensitive response  to xoo. nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of resistance mediated by xa <dig> remain unclear. in this study, the transcriptome profiling of a rice line carrying xa <dig> and its parents at the early stage of xoo infection were investigated.


RESULTS
a rice introgression line h <dig> carrying xa <dig> exhibited a typical local hypersensitive response phenotype, accompanied by programmed cell death after inoculation with the xoo philippines’ race 9b. transcriptome profiling of h <dig> and its parents at  <dig> and 2 days post-inoculation was performed using rna sequencing. in total,  <dig> differentially expressed genes  were identified in h <dig> compared with its recurrent parent huang-hua-zhan after inoculation with xoo. among them,  <dig>  genes, with functional enrichments that were related to defense response, protein amino acid phosphorylation, and apoptosis, were found to be constitutively expressed. the other  <dig>  genes, with go terms that belonged to defense response, were significantly responsive to xoo infection in h <dig>  ten up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes encoding intracellular immune receptors were identified in h <dig> compared with huang-hua-zhan. loc_os11g <dig>  which was located in the fine-mapping region harboring xa <dig>  is a xa <dig> candidate gene. the putative bshr-related co-regulatory networks were constructed using  <dig> degs from four functional groups, including gibberellic acid receptors and brassinosteroid regulators, which were differentially co-expressed with loc_os11g <dig> in infected h <dig>  our results indicated that there might be cross-talk between the xa39-mediated signal transduction cascades and the ga/br signaling pathway, and that the defense mechanism was related to diverse kinases, transcription factors, post-translational regulation, and r genes.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides the comprehensive transcriptome profile of a rice introgression line carrying xa <dig> and its parents, and identifies a set of degs involved in bshr mediated by xa <dig>  these data provide novel insights into the regulatory networks of plant disease resistance mediated by r genes, and the identified degs will serve as candidates for xa <dig> cloning and for further understanding the molecular mechanism of bshr.
