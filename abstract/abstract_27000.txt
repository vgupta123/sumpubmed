BACKGROUND
metabolic correlation networks are derived from the covariance of metabolites in replicates of metabolomics experiments. they constitute an interesting intermediate between topology  and dynamics .


RESULTS
here we analyze, how such a correlation network changes over time, and compare the relative positions of metabolites in the correlation networks with those in established metabolic networks derived from genome databases. we find that network similarity indeed decreases with an increasing time difference between these networks during a day/night course and, counter intuitively, that proximity of metabolites in the correlation network is no indicator of proximity of the metabolites in the metabolic network.


CONCLUSIONS
the organizing principles of correlation networks are distinct from those of metabolic reaction maps. time courses of correlation networks may in the future prove an important data source for understanding these organizing principles.
