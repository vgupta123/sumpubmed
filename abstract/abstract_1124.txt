BACKGROUND
accurate identification is necessary to discriminate harmless environmental yersinia species from the food-borne pathogens yersinia enterocolitica and yersinia pseudotuberculosis and from the group a bioterrorism plague agent yersinia pestis. in order to circumvent the limitations of current phenotypic and pcr-based identification methods, we aimed to assess the usefulness of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight  protein profiling for accurate and rapid identification of yersinia species. as a first step, we built a database of  <dig> different yersinia strains representing  <dig> different yersinia species, including  <dig> y. pestis isolates representative of the antiqua, medievalis and orientalis biotypes. the organisms were deposited on the maldi-tof plate after appropriate ethanol-based inactivation, and a protein profile was obtained within  <dig> minutes for each of the yersinia species.


RESULTS
when compared with a  <dig> -profile database, every yersinia species yielded a unique protein profile and was unambiguously identified. in the second step of analysis, environmental and clinical isolates of y. pestis  and y. enterocolitica  were compared to the database and correctly identified. in particular, y. pestis was unambiguously identified at the species level, and maldi-tof was able to successfully differentiate the three biotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
these data indicate that maldi-tof can be used as a rapid and accurate first-line method for the identification of yersinia isolates.
