BACKGROUND
pradofloxacin, a newly developed 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone, show enhanced activity against gram-positive organisms and anaerobes to treat canine and feline bacterial infections. the purpose of this cross-over study was to measure the unbound drug concentration of pradofloxacin in the interstitial fluid  using ultrafiltration and to compare the kinetics of pradofloxacin in serum, isf and tissue using enrofloxacin as reference.


RESULTS
after oral administration of enrofloxacin  and pradofloxacin , serum collection and ultrafiltration in regular intervals over a period of  <dig> h were performed, followed by tissue sampling at the end of the third dosing protocol . peak concentrations of pradofloxacin  were  <dig> ± <dig>  μg/ml in the isf and  <dig> ± <dig>  μg/ml in serum and for pradofloxacin   <dig> ± <dig>  μg/kg in the isf and  <dig> ± <dig>  μg/kg in serum; both without a statistical difference between isf and serum. comparison between all sampling approaches showed no consistent pattern of statistical differences.


CONCLUSIONS
despite some technical shortcomings the ultrafiltration approach appears to be the most sensitive sampling technique to estimate pharmacokinetic values of pradofloxacin at the infection site. pharmacokinetics – pradofloxacin – ultrafiltration – dog – oral administration.
