BACKGROUND
the oil palm  has the highest oil yield of any crop species, as well as comprising the richest dietary source of provitamin a. for the tropical species, the best mean growth temperature is about 27°c, with a minimal growth temperature of 15°c. hence, the plantation area is limited into the geographical ranges of 10°n to 10°s. enhancing cold tolerance capability will increase the total cultivation area and subsequently oil productivity of this tropical species. developing molecular markers related to cold tolerance would be helpful for molecular breeding of cold tolerant elaeis guineensis.


RESULTS
in total,  <dig> gene-based ssrs were identified in  <dig>  expressed sequences from elaeis guineensis transcriptome data: approximately one ssr was detected per  <dig> expressed sequences. of these  <dig> gene-based ssrs,  <dig> were derived from expressed sequences up- or down-regulated at least two-fold in response to cold stress. a total of  <dig> polymorphic markers were developed and characterized from  <dig> primer pairs flanking these cold-responsive ssr repeats. the polymorphic information content  of these polymorphic ssr markers across  <dig> lines of elaeis guineensis varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . using in-silico mapping,  <dig>  of the  <dig> polymorphic ssr markers were located onto the  <dig> elaeis guineensis chromosomes. total coverage of  <dig> mbp was achieved, with an average physical distance of  <dig>  mbp between adjacent markers . meanwhile, comparative analysis of transcriptome under cold stress revealed that one ice <dig> putative ortholog, five cbf putative orthologs,  <dig> nac transcription factors and four cold-induced orhologs were up-regulated at least two fold in response to cold stress. interestingly, 5′ untranslated region of both unigene <dig>  and cl <dig> contig <dig>  both contained an ssr markers.


CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, a series of ssr markers were developed based on sequences differentially expressed in response to cold stress. these est-ssr markers would be particularly useful for gene mapping and population structure analysis in elaeis guineensis. meanwhile, the est-ssr loci were inducible expressed in response to low temperature, which may have potential application in identifying trait-associated markers in oil palm in the future.
