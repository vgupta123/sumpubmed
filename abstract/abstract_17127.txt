BACKGROUND
ontology-based enrichment analysis aids in the interpretation and understanding of large-scale biological data. ontologies are hierarchies of biologically relevant groupings. using ontology annotations, which link ontology classes to biological entities, enrichment analysis methods assess whether there is a significant over or under representation of entities for ontology classes. while many tools exist that run enrichment analysis for protein sets annotated with the gene ontology, there are only a few that can be used for small molecules enrichment analysis.


RESULTS
we describe binche, an enrichment analysis tool for small molecules based on the chebi ontology. binche displays an interactive graph that can be exported as a high-resolution image or in network formats. the tool provides plain, weighted and fragment analysis based on either the chebi role ontology or the chebi structural ontology.


CONCLUSIONS
binche aids in the exploration of large sets of small molecules produced within metabolomics or other systems biology research contexts. the open-source tool provides easy and highly interactive web access to enrichment analysis with the chebi ontology tool and is additionally available as a standalone library.
