BACKGROUND
the resolution of radiation hybrid  maps is intermediate between that of the genetic and bac  contig maps. moreover, once framework rh maps of a genome have been constructed, a quick location of markers by simple pcr on the rh panel is possible. the chicken chickrh <dig> panel recently produced was used here to construct a high resolution rh map of chicken gga <dig>  to confirm the validity of the map and to provide valuable comparative mapping information, both markers from the genetic map and a high number of ests  were used. finally, this rh map was used for testing the accuracy of the chicken genome assembly for chromosome  <dig> 


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> markers  were typed on the chickrh <dig> rh panel, of which  <dig> were assigned to gga <dig>  the final map is composed of  <dig> framework markers extending over a  <dig>  cr distance. the remaining  <dig> markers were placed alongside the framework markers within confidence intervals.


CONCLUSIONS
the high resolution framework map obtained in this study has markers covering the entire chicken chromosome  <dig> and reveals the existence of a high number of rearrangements when compared to the human genome. only two discrepancies were observed in relation to the sequence assembly recently reported for this chromosome.
