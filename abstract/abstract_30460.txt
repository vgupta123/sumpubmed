BACKGROUND
signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  is a critical component of interferon -alpha/beta and ifn-gamma signaling. although seven isoforms of stat proteins have been reported from mammals, limited information is available for the stat genes in fish. we isolated complementary dna with high similarity to mammalian stat <dig> from the olive flounder, paralichthys olivaceus.


RESULTS
a dna fragment containing the conserved sh <dig> domain was amplified by rt-pcr using degenerate primers designed based on the highly conserved sequences in the sh <dig> domains of the zebrafish and mammalian stat <dig>  the complete cdna sequence was obtained by 5' and 3' race. the flounder stat <dig> transcript consisted of  <dig>  bp that encoded a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids. the overall similarity between flounder stat <dig> and other stats was very high, with the highest amino acid sequence identity to snakehead . phylogenetic analyses reveal that flounder stat <dig> is in the same monophyletic group with snakehead stat <dig>  quantitative real time rt-pcr and in situ hybridization revealed that stat <dig> was expressed in almost all examined organs and tissues, with high expression in gill, spleen, kidney, and heart. the accumulation of stat <dig> mrna in different developmental stages, as determined by real time rt-pcr, increased with development.


CONCLUSIONS
recent cloning of various cytokine genes and the stat <dig> gene of olive flounder here suggest that fish also use the highly specialized jak-stat pathway for cytokine signaling. identification of other stat genes will elucidate in detail the signal transduction system in this fish.
