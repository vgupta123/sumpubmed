BACKGROUND
the aim of the present study was to identify a specific neuronal correlate underlying the pre-attentive auditory stream segregation of subsequent sound patterns alternating in spectral or temporal cues. fifteen participants with normal hearing were presented with series’ of two consecutive aba auditory tone-triplet sequences, the initial triplets being the adaptation sequence and the subsequent triplets being the test sequence. in the first experiment, the frequency separation  between a and b tones in the sequences was varied by  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> semitones. in the second experiment, a constant delta-f of  <dig> semitones was maintained but the inter-stimulus intervals  between a and b tones were varied. auditory evoked magnetic fields  were recorded using magnetoencephalography . participants watched a muted video of their choice and ignored the auditory stimuli. in a subsequent behavioral study both meg experiments were replicated to provide information about the participants’ perceptual state.


RESULTS
meg measurements showed a significant increase in the amplitude of the b-tone related p <dig> component of the aefs as delta-f increased. this effect was seen predominantly in the left hemisphere. a significant increase in the amplitude of the n <dig> component was only obtained for a test sequence delta-f of  <dig> semitones with a prior adaptation sequence of  <dig> semitones. this effect was more pronounced in the right hemisphere. the additional behavioral data indicated an increased probability of two-stream perception for delta-f =  <dig> and delta-f =  <dig> semitones with a preceding adaptation sequence of  <dig> semitones. however, neither the neural activity nor the perception of the successive streaming sequences were modulated when the isis were alternated.


CONCLUSIONS
our meg experiment demonstrated differences in the behavior of p <dig> and n <dig> components during the automatic segregation of sounds when induced by an initial adaptation sequence. the p <dig> component appeared enhanced in all test-conditions and thus demonstrates the preceding context effect, whereas n <dig> was specifically modulated only by large delta-f test sequences induced by a preceding small delta-f adaptation sequence. these results suggest that p <dig> and n <dig> components represent at least partially-different systems that underlie the neural representation of auditory streaming.
