BACKGROUND
lymnaeidae snails play a prominent role in the transmission of helminths, mainly trematodes of medical and veterinary importance . as this family exhibits a great diversity in shell morphology but extremely homogeneous anatomical traits, the systematics of lymnaeidae has long been controversial. using the most complete dataset to date, we examined phylogenetic relationships among  <dig> taxa of this family using a supermatrix approach  involving both maximum likelihood and bayesian inference.


RESULTS
our phylogenetic analysis demonstrates the existence of three deep clades of lymnaeidae representing the main geographic origin of species . this phylogeny allowed us to discuss on potential biological invasions and map important characters, such as, the susceptibility to infection by fasciola hepatica and f. gigantica, and the haploid number of chromosomes . we found that intermediate hosts of f. gigantica cluster within one deep clade, while intermediate hosts of f. hepatica are widely spread across the phylogeny. in addition, chromosome number seems to have evolved from n =  <dig> to n =  <dig> and n =  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our study contributes to deepen our understanding of lymnaeidae phylogeny by both sampling at worldwide scale and combining information from various genes . this phylogeny provides insights into the evolutionary relationships among genera and species and demonstrates that the nomenclature of most genera in the lymnaeidae does not reflect evolutionary relationships. this study highlights the importance of performing basic studies in systematics to guide epidemiological control programs.
