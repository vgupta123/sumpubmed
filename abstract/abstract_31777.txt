BACKGROUND
linking phenotypes to high-throughput molecular biology information generated by ~omics technologies allows revealing cellular mechanisms underlying an organism's phenotype. ~omics datasets are often very large and noisy with many features . thus, associating phenotypes to ~omics data requires an approach that is robust to noise and can handle large and diverse data sets.


RESULTS
we developed a web-tool phenolink  that links phenotype to ~omics data sets using well-established as well new techniques. phenolink imputes missing values and preprocesses input data  to decrease inherent noise in the data and  to counterbalance pitfalls of the random forest algorithm, on which feature  selection is based. preprocessed data is used in feature  selection to identify relations to phenotypes. we applied phenolink to identify gene-phenotype relations based on the presence/absence of  <dig> genes in  <dig> lactobacillus plantarum strains and phenotypic measurements of these strains in several experimental conditions, including growth on sugars and nitrogen-dioxide production. genes were ranked based on their importance  to correctly predict the phenotype of a given strain. in addition to known gene to phenotype relations we also found novel relations.


CONCLUSIONS
phenolink is an easily accessible web-tool to facilitate identifying relations from large and often noisy phenotype and ~omics datasets. visualization of links to phenotypes offered in phenolink allows prioritizing links, finding relations between features, finding relations between phenotypes, and identifying outliers in phenotype data. phenolink can be used to uncover phenotype links to a multitude of ~omics data, e.g., gene presence/absence , gene expression , or metabolite abundance .
