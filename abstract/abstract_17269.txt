BACKGROUND
nucleic acid amplification techniques are being used increasingly in diagnosing tuberculosis. in developing countries clinical samples are often stored for subsequent analysis since molecular tests are conducted at only a limited number of laboratories. this study was conducted to assess the speed at which mycobacteria undergo autolysis and free dna is detected in the supernatant during low-temperature storage.


RESULTS
eighty-seven smear positive sputa from tuberculosis patients were analysed immediately and after storage at -20Â°c. timelines of  <dig> and  <dig> months were selected to assess the maximum extent of dna loss that occurred during storage. all samples remained pcr- and smear-positive at  <dig> month and only  <dig> sample turned negative after  <dig> months. bacterial lysis in the specimens was demonstrated by pcr analysis of supernatant fractions; 53% of the freshly analysed samples contained mycobacterial dna in supernatants. pcr positivity increased significantly during storage . storage-associated bacterial lysis was accompanied by a decrease in smear grade status in  <dig> of  <dig> samples  and a significant storage-associated reduction in bacterial numbers in the remaining samples.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that  freshly isolated sputum contains both intact and lysed mycobacteria,  lysis increased during storage and  supernatant fractions routinely discarded during sample processing contain mycobacterial dna. we propose that supernatant is a valuable sample for pcr for both fresh and stored specimens, particularly those with a low bacterial load in addition to conventional sediment.
