BACKGROUND
the rubber tree, hevea brasiliensis, is an important plant species that is commercially grown to produce latex rubber in many countries. the rubber tree variety bpm  <dig> exhibits cytoplasmic male sterility, inherited from the variety gt  <dig> 


RESULTS
we constructed the rubber tree mitochondrial genome of a cytoplasmic male sterile variety, bpm  <dig>  using  <dig> sequencing, including 8Â kb paired-end libraries, plus illumina paired-end sequencing. we annotated this mitochondrial genome with the aid of illumina rna-seq data and performed comparative analysis. we then compared the sequence of bpm  <dig> to the contigs of the published rubber tree, variety rrim  <dig>  and identified a rearrangement that is unique to bpm  <dig> resulting in a novel transcript containing a portion of atp <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the novel transcript is consistent with changes that cause cytoplasmic male sterility through a slight reduction to atp production efficiency. the exhaustive nature of the search rules out alternative causes and supports previous findings of novel transcripts causing cytoplasmic male sterility.
