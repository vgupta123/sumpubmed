BACKGROUND
tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases- <dig>  is a multifunctional secreted protein with pleiotropic actions, including the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases , cell death/survival and growth promoting activities. after inflammatory challenge, the levels of timp- <dig> are highly and selectively upregulated in astrocytes among glial cells, but little is know about its role in these neural cells. we investigated the influence of timp- <dig> null mutation in the reactivity of cultured astrocytes to pro-inflammatory stimuli with tnf-α and anti-fas antibody.


RESULTS
when compared to wt, mutant astrocytes displayed an overall increased constitutive gelatinase expression and were less responsive to fas-mediated upregulation of mmp- <dig>  of monocyte chemoattractant protein- <dig>  and of intercellular cell adhesion molecule- <dig> , all markers of astrocyte inflammatory response. in contrast, tnf-α treatment induced all these factors similarly regardless of the astrocyte genotype. the incorporation of 3h-thymidin, a marker of cell proliferation, increased in wild-type  astrocytes after treatment with anti-fas antibody or recombinant timp- <dig> but not in mutant astrocytes. finally, lymphocyte chemotaxis was differentially regulated by tnf-α in wt and timp- <dig> deficient astrocytes.


CONCLUSIONS
we provide evidence that the alteration of the mmp/timp balance in astrocytes influences their reactivity to pro-inflammatory stimuli and that fas activation modulates the expression of members of the mmp/timp axis. we hypothesise that the fas/fasl transduction pathway and the mmp/timp system interact in astrocytes to modulate their inflammatory response to environmental stimuli.
