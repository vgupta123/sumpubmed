BACKGROUND
1-methyl-4-phenyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydropyridine  induces parkinson’s disease -like neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta  via its oxidized product, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium , which is transported by the dopamine  transporter into da nerve terminals. da receptor subtype  <dig>  participates in neurotransmitter transport, gene regulation in the da system, physiological accommodation via g protein-coupled superfamily receptors and other physiological processes in the nervous system. this study investigated the possible correlation between d <dig> receptors and mptp-induced neurotoxicity. a series of behavioral experiments and histological analyses were conducted in d <dig> receptor-deficient mice, using an mptp-induced model of pd.


RESULTS
after the fourth mptp injection, wild-type animals that received  <dig> mg/kg per day displayed significant neurotoxin-related bradykinesia. d <dig> receptor-deficient mice displayed attenuated mptp-induced locomotor activity changes. consistent with the behavioral observations, further neurohistological assessment showed that mptp-induced neuronal damage in the snpc was reduced in d <dig> receptor-deficient mice.


CONCLUSIONS
our study indicates that the d <dig> receptor might be an essential molecule in mptp-induced pd and provides a new molecular mechanism for mptp neurotoxicity.
