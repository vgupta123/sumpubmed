BACKGROUND
in the context of global climate change, heat stress is becoming an increasingly important constraint on grapevine growth and berry quality. there is a need to breed new grape cultivars with heat tolerance and to design effective physiological defenses against heat stress. the investigation of heat injury to plants or tissues under high temperature is an important step in achieving these goals. at present, evaluation methods for heat injury include the gas exchange parameters of photosynthesis, membrane thermostability, chlorophyll content etc.; however, these methods have obvious disadvantages, such as insensitivity, inconvenience and delayed information. an effective and convenient method for investigating the heat injury of grapevine must be developed.


RESULTS
in this study, an investigation protocol for a critical temperature  and heat treatment time  was developed in detached grape leaves. based on the results, we found that the ojip test was superior to measuring electrolyte leakage or photosynthetic o <dig> evolution for investigating the heat injury of three cultivars of grapevine. heat tolerance of  <dig> grape species and cultivars was evaluated through investigating heat injury using the ojip test. moreover, the electron transport chain  of psii in photosynthesis was further investigated.


CONCLUSIONS
the ojip test was a rapid, sensitive and convenient method for investigating heat injury in grapevine. an analysis of psii function using this method indicated that the acceptor side was less sensitive to heat than was the donor side or the reaction center in grape leaves. among the  <dig> taxa evaluated , heat tolerance varied largely in each genotype group: most wild species and hybrids between v. labrusca and v. vinifera had relatively strong heat tolerance, but most cultivars from v. vinifera had relatively weak heat tolerance.
