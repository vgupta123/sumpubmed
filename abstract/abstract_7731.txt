BACKGROUND
inducible conditional knockout animals are widely used to get insight in the function of genes and the pathogenesis of human diseases. these models frequently rely on cre-mediated recombination of sequences flanked by lox-p sites. to understand the consequences of gene disruption, it is essential to know the efficiency of the recombination process.


RESULTS
here, we describe a modification of the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification , called extension-mlpa , which enables quantification of relatively small differences in dna that are a consequence of cre-mediated recombination. emlpa, here applied on an inducible pkd <dig> conditional deletion mouse model, simultaneously measures both the reduction of the floxed allele and the increase of the deletion allele in a single reaction thereby minimizing any type of experimental variation. interestingly, with this method we were also able to observe the presence of the excised dna fragment. this extra-chromosomal deletion-circle was detectable up to  <dig> months after activation of cre.


CONCLUSIONS
emlpa is a novel strategy which easily can be applied to measure the cre-mediated recombination efficiency in each experimental case with high accuracy. in addition the fate of the deletion-circle can be followed simultaneously.
