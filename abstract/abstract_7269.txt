BACKGROUND
clostridium acetobutylicum has been used to produce butanol in industry. catabolite control protein a , known to mediate carbon catabolite repression  in low gc gram-positive bacteria, has been identified and characterized in c. acetobutylicum by our previous work . to further dissect its regulatory function in c. acetobutylicum, ccpa was investigated using dna microarray followed by phenotypic, genetic and biochemical validation.


RESULTS
ccpa controls not only genes in carbon metabolism, but also those genes in solvent production and sporulation of the life cycle in c. acetobutylicum: i) ccpa directly repressed transcription of genes related to transport and metabolism of non-preferred carbon sources such as d-xylose and l-arabinose, and activated expression of genes responsible for d-glucose pts system; ii) ccpa is involved in positive regulation of the key solventogenic operon sol  and negative regulation of acidogenic gene bukii; and iii) transcriptional alterations were observed for several sporulation-related genes upon ccpa inactivation, which may account for the lower sporulation efficiency in the mutant, suggesting ccpa may be necessary for efficient sporulation of c. acetobutylicum, an important trait adversely affecting the solvent productivity.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provided insights to the pleiotropic functions that ccpa displayed in butanol-producing c. acetobutylicum. the information could be valuable for further dissecting its pleiotropic regulatory mechanism in c. acetobutylicum, and for genetic modification in order to obtain more effective butanol-producing clostridium strains.
