BACKGROUND
the polima  system of cytoplasmic male sterility  and its fertility restoration gene rfp have been used in hybrid breeding in brassica napus, which has greatly improved the yield of rapeseed. however, the mechanism of the male sterility transition in pol cms remains to be determined.


RESULTS
to investigate the transcriptome during the male sterility transition in pol cms, a near-isogenic line  of pol cms was constructed. the phenotypic features and sterility stage were confirmed by anatomical analysis. subsequently, we compared the genomic expression profiles of fertile and sterile young flower buds by rna-seq. a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequences were successfully obtained. these reads were assembled into  <dig>  unigenes, which composed the transcriptome of the bud. among these unigenes,  <dig>   were annotated using public protein databases and classified into functional clusters. in addition, we investigated the changes in expression of the fertile and sterile buds; the rna-seq data showed  <dig>  unigenes had significantly different expression and they were mainly distributed in metabolic and protein synthesis pathways. additionally, some unigenes controlling anther development were dramatically down-regulated in sterile buds.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggested that an energy deficiency caused by orf224/atp <dig> may inhibit a series of genes that regulate pollen development through nuclear-mitochondrial interaction. this results in the sterility of pol cms by leading to the failure of sporogenous cell differentiation. this study may provide assistance for detailed molecular analysis and a better understanding of pol cms in b. napus.
