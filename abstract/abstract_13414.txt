BACKGROUND
silage maize is a major forage and energy resource for cattle feeding, and several studies have shown that lignin content and structure are the determining factors in forage maize feeding value. in maize, four natural brown-midrib mutants have modified lignin content, lignin structure and cell wall digestibility. the greatest lignin reduction and the highest cell wall digestibility were observed in the brown-midrib- <dig>  mutant, which is disrupted in the caffeic acid o-methyltransferase  gene.


RESULTS
expression of cell wall related genes was investigated in basal and ear internodes of normal, comt antisens , and bm <dig> maize plants of the inra f <dig> line. a cell wall macro-array was developed with  <dig> gene specific tags of genes specifically involved in cell wall biogenesis. when comparing basal  and ear  internodes of the normal line, all genes known to be involved in constitutive monolignol biosynthesis had a higher expression in younger ear internodes. the expression of the comt gene was heavily reduced, especially in the younger lignifying tissues of the ear internode. despite the fact that as <dig> transgene expression was driven only in sclerenchyma tissues, comt expression was also heavily reduced in as <dig> ear and basal internodes. comt disruption or down-regulation led to differential expressions of a few lignin pathway genes, which were all over-expressed, except for a phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene. more unexpectedly, several transcription factor genes, cell signaling genes, transport and detoxification genes, genes involved in cell wall carbohydrate metabolism and genes encoding cell wall proteins, were differentially expressed, and mostly over-expressed, in comt-deficient plants.


CONCLUSIONS
differential gene expressions in comt-deficient plants highlighted a probable disturbance in cell wall assembly. in addition, the gene expressions suggested modified chronology of the different events leading to cell expansion and lignification with consequences far beyond the phenylpropanoid metabolism. the reduced availability of monolignols and s units in bm <dig> or as <dig> plants led to plants also differing in cell wall carbohydrate, and probably protein, composition. thus, the deficiency in a key-enzyme of the lignin pathway had correlative effects on the whole cell wall metabolism. furthermore, the observed differential expression between bm <dig> and normal plants indicated the possible involvement in the maize lignin pathway of genes which up until now have not been considered to play this role.
