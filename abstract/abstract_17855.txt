BACKGROUND
sand fly saliva can drive the outcome of leishmania infection in animal models, and salivary components have been postulated as vaccine candidates against leishmaniasis. in the sand fly phlebotomus papatasi, natural sugar-sources modulate the activity of proteins involved in meal digestion, and possibly influence vectorial capacity. however, only a handful of studies have assessed the variability of salivary components in sand flies, focusing on the effects of environmental factors in natural habitats. in order to better understand such interactions, we compared the expression profiles of nine p. papatasi salivary gland genes of specimens inhabiting different ecological habitats in egypt and jordan and throughout the sand fly season in each habitat.


RESULTS
the majority of investigated genes were up-regulated in specimens from swaymeh late in the season, when the availability of sugar sources is reduced due to water deprivation. on the other hand, these genes were not up-regulated in specimens collected from aswan, an irrigated area less susceptible to drought effects.


CONCLUSIONS
expression plasticity of genes involved with vectorial capacity in disease vectors may play an important epidemiological role in the establishment of diseases in natural habitats.
