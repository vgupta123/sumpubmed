BACKGROUND
atpase/helicases and nucleases play important roles in homologous recombination repair . many of the mechanistic details relating to these enzymes and their function in this fundamental and complicated dna repair process remain poorly understood in archaea. here we employed sulfolobus islandicus, a hyperthermophilic archaeon, as a model to investigate the in vivo functions of the atpase/helicase hera, the nuclease nura, and their associated proteins mre <dig> and rad <dig> 


RESULTS
we revealed that each of the four genes in the same operon, mre <dig>  rad <dig>  hera, and nura, are essential for cell viability by a mutant propagation assay. a genetic complementation assay with mutant proteins was combined with biochemical characterization demonstrating that the atpase activity of hera, the interaction between hera and nura, and the efficient 5′-3′ dna end resection activity of the hera-nura complex are essential for cell viability. nura and two other putative hrr proteins: a pin -domain containing atpase and the holliday junction resolvase hjc, were co-purified with a chromosomally encoded n-his-hera in vivo. the interactions of hera with the atpase and hjc were further confirmed by in vitro pull down.


CONCLUSIONS
efficient 5′-3′ dna end resection activity of the hera-nura complex contributes to necessity of hera and nura in sulfolobus, which is crucial to yield a 3′-overhang in hrr. hera may have additional binding partners in cells besides nura.
