BACKGROUND
the effect of neurotrophic factors in enhancing stroke-induced neurogenesis in the adult subventricular zone  is limited by their poor blood-brain barrier  permeability.

intranasal administration is a noninvasive and valid method for delivery of neuropeptides into the brain, to bypass the bbb. we investigated the effect of treatment with intranasal transforming growth factor-β <dig>  on neurogenesis in the adult mouse svz following focal ischemia. the modified neurological severity scores  test was used to evaluate neurological function, and infarct volumes were determined from hematoxylin-stained sections. terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp nick end labeling  labeling was performed at  <dig> days after middle cerebral artery occlusion . immunohistochemistry was used to detect bromodeoxyuridine  and neuron- or glia-specific markers for identifying neurogenesis in the svz at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> days after mcao.


RESULTS
intranasal treatment of tgf-β <dig> shows significant improvement in neurological function and reduction of infarct volume compared with control animals. tgf-β <dig> treated mice had significantly less tunel-positive cells in the ipsilateral striatum than that in control groups. the number of brdu-incorporated cells in the svz and striatum was significantly increased in the tgf-β <dig> treated group compared with control animals at each time point. in addition, numbers of brdu- labeled cells coexpressed with the migrating neuroblast marker doublecortin  and the mature neuronal marker neuronal nuclei  were significantly increased after intranasal delivery of tgf-β <dig>  while only a few brdu labeled cells co-stained with glial fibrillary acidic protein .


CONCLUSIONS
intranasal administration of tgf-β <dig> reduces infarct volume, improves functional recovery and enhances neurogenesis in mice after stroke. intranasal tgf-β <dig> may have therapeutic potential for cerebrovascular disorders.
