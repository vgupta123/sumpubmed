BACKGROUND
the hox family of transcription factors has a fundamental role in segmentation pathways and axial patterning of embryonic development and their clustered organization is linked with the regulatory mechanisms governing their coordinated expression along embryonic axes. among chordates, of particular interest are the hox paralogous genes in groups 1- <dig> since their expression is coupled to the control of regional identity in the anterior nervous system, where the highest structural diversity is observed.


RESULTS
to investigate the degree of conservation in cis-regulatory components that form the basis of hox expression in the anterior nervous system, we have used assays for transcriptional activity in ascidians and vertebrates to compare and contrast regulatory potential. we identified four regulatory sequences located near the cihox <dig>  cihox <dig> and cihox <dig> genes of the ascidian ciona intestinalis which direct neural specific domains of expression. using functional assays in ciona and vertebrate embryos in combination with sequence analyses of enhancer fragments located in similar positions adjacent to hox paralogy group genes, we compared the activity of these four ciona cis-elements with a series of neural specific enhancers from the amphioxus hox1- <dig> genes and from mouse hox paralogous groups 1- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this analysis revealed that kreisler and krox <dig> dependent enhancers critical in segmental regulation of the hindbrain appear to be specific for the vertebrate lineage. in contrast, neural enhancers that function as hox response elements through the action of hox/pbx binding motifs have been conserved during chordate evolution. the functional assays reveal that these hox response cis-elements are recognized by the regulatory components of different and extant species. together, our results indicate that during chordate evolution, cis-elements dependent upon hox/pbx regulatory complexes, are responsible for key aspects of segmental hox expression in neural tissue and appeared with urochordates after cephalochordate divergence.
