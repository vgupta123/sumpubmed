BACKGROUND
the study was designed to investigate correlation between histological findings of lawsonia intracellularis in porcine cases of diarrhoea and the quantitative detection of lawsonia intracellularis in faeces. a total of  <dig> pigs  with diarrhoea were randomly selected from  <dig> herds: the pigs were subjected to necropsy, histopathology, immunohistochemistry and faecal quantification of lawsonia intracellularis by real time pcr.


RESULTS
the median lawsonia intracellularis excretion was significantly higher in pigs with gross lesions of proliferative enteropathy  compared to pigs without gross lesions of proliferative enteropathy  . spearman’s correlation coefficient between the measureable pe lesions and l. intracellularis excretion was  <dig>  . a significantly increasing trend in lawsonia intracellularis excretion level for increasing proliferative enteropathy histopathology and immunohistochemistry scores was demonstrated . spearman’s correlation coefficient between the histopathology scores and l. intracellularis excretion was  <dig>  . spearman’s correlation coefficient between the ihc scores and l. intracellularis excretion was  <dig>  .


CONCLUSIONS
the histological and quantitative pcr detection of lawsonia intracellularis were correlated in pigs with diarrhoea. overall the results suggest that clinically important levels for lawsonia intracellularis excretion in faeces may be established. such clinical threshold levels may be used in practice to confirm a diagnosis of lawsonia intracellularis associated diarrhoea.
