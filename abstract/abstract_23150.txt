BACKGROUND
the use of molecular genetic data in phylogenetic systematics has revolutionized this field of research in that several taxonomic groupings defined by traditional taxonomic approaches have been rejected by molecular data. the taxonomic classification of the oribatid mite group circumdehiscentiae  is largely based on morphological characters and several different classification schemes, all based upon the validity of diagnostic morphological characters, have been proposed by various authors. the aims of this study were to test the appropriateness of the current taxonomic classification schemes for the circumdehiscentiae and to trace the evolution of the main diagnostic traits  on the basis of a molecular phylogenetic hypothesis by means of parsimony, likelihood and bayesian approaches.


RESULTS
the molecular phylogeny based on three nuclear markers  revealed considerable discrepancies to the traditional classification of the five "circumdehiscent" subdivisions, suggesting paraphyly of the three families scutoverticidae, ameronothridae, cymbaeremaeidae and also of the genus achipteria. ancestral state reconstructions of six common diagnostic characters and statistical evaluation of alternative phylogenetic hypotheses also partially rejected the current morphology-based classification and suggested multiple convergent evolution  of some traits, after a period of rapid cladogenesis, rendering several subgroups paraphyletic.


CONCLUSIONS
phylogenetic studies revealed non-monophyly of three families and one genus as a result of a lack of adequate synapomorphic morphological characters, calling for further detailed investigations in a framework of integrative taxonomy. character histories of six morphological traits indicate that their evolution followed a rather complex pattern of multiple independent gains . thus, the observed pattern largely conflicts with current morphological classifications of the circumdehiscentiae, suggesting that the current taxonomic classification schemes are not appropriate, apart from a recently proposed subdivision into  <dig> superfamilies.
