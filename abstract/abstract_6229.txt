BACKGROUND
signal transducer and activator of transcription  proteins are key regulators of gene expression in response to the interferon  family of anti-viral and anti-microbial cytokines. we have examined the genomic relationship between stat <dig> binding and regulated transcription using multiple tiling microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation microarray  experiments from public repositories.


RESULTS
in response to ifn-γ, stat <dig> bound proximally to regions of the genome that exhibit regulated transcriptional activity. this finding was consistent between different tiling microarray platforms, and between different measures of transcriptional activity, including differential binding of rna polymerase ii, and differential mrna transcription. re-analysis of tiling microarray data from a recent study of ifn-γ-induced stat <dig> chip-chip and mrna expression revealed that stat <dig> binding is tightly associated with localized mrna transcription in response to ifn-γ. close relationships were also apparent between stat <dig> binding, stat <dig> binding, and mrna transcription in response to ifn-α. furthermore, we found that sites of stat <dig> binding within the encyclopedia of dna elements  region are precisely correlated with sites of either enhanced or diminished binding by the rna polymerase ii complex.


CONCLUSIONS
together, our results indicate that stat <dig> binds proximally to regions of the genome that exhibit regulated transcriptional activity. this finding establishes a generalized basis for the positioning of stat <dig> binding sites within the genome, and supports a role for stat <dig> in the direct recruitment of the rna polymerase ii complex to the promoters of ifn-γ-responsive genes.
