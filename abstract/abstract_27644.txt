BACKGROUND
freshwater fish absorb ca2+ predominantly from ambient water, and more than 97% of ca2+ uptake is achieved by active transport through gill mitochondrion-rich  cells. in the current model for ca2+ uptake in gill mr cells, ca2+ passively enters the cytosol via the epithelium ca2+ channel , and then is extruded into the plasma through the basolateral na+/ca2+ exchanger  and plasma membrane ca2+-atpase . however, no convincing molecular or cellular evidence has been available to support the role of specific pmca and/or ncx isoforms in this model. zebrafish  is a good model for analyzing isoforms of a gene because of the plentiful genomic databases and expression sequence tag  data.


RESULTS
using a strategy of blast from the zebrafish genome database ,  <dig> isoforms of pmcas  and  <dig> isoforms of ncxs  were identified. in the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  analysis,  <dig> pmcas and  <dig> ncxs were ubiquitously expressed in various tissues including gills. triple fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry showed the colocalization of zecac, zpmca <dig>  and zncx1b mrnas in a portion of gill mr cells , implying a subset of ionocytes specifically responsible for the transepithelial ca2+ uptake in zebrafish gills. the gene expressions in gills of high- or low-ca2+-acclimated zebrafish by quantitative real-time pcr analysis showed that zecac was the only gene regulated in response to environmental ca2+ levels, while zpmcas and zncxs remained steady.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides molecular evidence for the specific isoforms of ca2+ transporters, zecac, zpmca <dig>  and zncx1b, supporting the current ca2+ uptake model, in which ecac may play a role as the major regulatory target for this mechanism during environmental challenge.
