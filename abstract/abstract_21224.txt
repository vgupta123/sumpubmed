BACKGROUND
grapevine can be a periclinal chimera plant which is composed at least of two distinct cell layers . when the cell layers of this plant are separated by passage through somatic embryogenesis, regenerated plants could show distinct dna profiles and a novel phenotype which proved different from that of the parent plant.


RESULTS
genetically chardonnay clone  <dig> is a periclinal chimera plant in which is l <dig> and l <dig> cell layers are distinct. plants obtained via organogenesis through meristematic bulks are shown to be composed of both cell layers. however, plants regenerated through somatic embryogenesis starting from anthers or nodal explants are composed only of l <dig> cells. these somaclones do not show phenotypic differences to the parental clone up to three years after regeneration. interestingly, the only somaclone showing an atypical phenotype  shows a genotypic modification.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that the phenotype of chardonnay  <dig> does not result from an interaction between the two distinct cell layers l <dig> and l <dig>  if phenotype conformity is further confirmed, somatic embryogenesis will result in true-to-type somaclones of chardonnay  <dig> and would be well suitable for gene transfer.
