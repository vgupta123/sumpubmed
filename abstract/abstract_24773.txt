BACKGROUND
tracing the genetic origin of central european farmer n1a lineages can provide a unique opportunity to assess the patterns of the farming technology spread into central europe in the human prehistory. here, we have chosen twelve n1a samples from modern populations which are most similar with the farmer n1a types and performed the complete mitochondrial dna genome sequencing analysis. to assess the genetic and phylogeographic relationship, we performed a detailed survey of modern published n1a types from eurasian and african populations.


RESULTS
the geographic origin and expansion of farmer lineages related n1a subclades have been deduced from combined analysis of  <dig> complete sequences with  <dig> n1a haplotypes. the phylogeographic analysis revealed that the central european farmer lineages have originated from different sources: from eastern europe, local central europe, and from the near east via southern europe.


CONCLUSIONS
the results obtained emphasize that the arrival of central european farmer lineages did not occur via a single demic diffusion event from the near east at the onset of the neolithic spread of agriculture into europe. indeed these results indicate that the neolithic transition process was more complex in central europe and possibly the farmer n1a lineages were a result of a 'leapfrog' colonization process.
