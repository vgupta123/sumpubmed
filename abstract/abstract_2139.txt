BACKGROUND
in the drosophila ovary, germ-line and soma cells are interconnected via gap junctions. the main gap-junction proteins in invertebrates are members of the innexin family. in order to reveal the role that innexins play in cell-cell communication during oogenesis, we investigated the localization of innexins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> using immunohistochemistry, and analyzed follicle development following channel blockade.


RESULTS
we found innexin  <dig> predominantly localized to the baso-lateral domain of follicle cells, whereas innexin  <dig> is positioned apico-laterally as well as apically between follicle cells and germ-line cells. innexin  <dig> was observed laterally in follicle cells and also in nurse cells, and innexin  <dig> was detected in the oolemma up to stage  <dig> and in nurse-cell membranes up to stage  <dig>  in order to test whether innexins form channels suitable for intercellular communication, we microinjected innexin antibodies in combination with a fluorescent tracer into the oocyte of stage- <dig> follicles. we found that dye-coupling between oocyte and follicle cells was largely reduced by innexin- <dig> antibodies directed against the intracellular c-terminus as well as against the intracellular loop. analyzing in vitro, between stages  <dig> and  <dig>  the developmental capacities of follicles following microinjections of innexin- <dig> antibodies revealed defects in follicle-cell differentiation, nurse-cell regression, oocyte growth and choriogenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that all analyzed innexins are involved in the formation of gap junctions in the ovary. while innexins  <dig> and  <dig> are colocalized between soma cells, innexins  <dig> and  <dig> are colocalized between soma and germ-line cells. innexin  <dig> is participating in cell-cell communication via hemichannels residing in the oolemma. it is obvious that gap-junctional communication between germ-line and soma cells is essential for several processes during oogenesis.
