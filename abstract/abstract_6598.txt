BACKGROUND
the perceived size of objects not only depends on their physical size but also on the surroundings in which they appear. for example, an object surrounded by small items looks larger than a physically identical object surrounded by big items , and a physically identical but distant object looks larger than an object that appears closer in space . activity in human primary visual cortex  reflects the perceived rather than the physical size of objects, indicating an involvement of v <dig> in illusory size perception. here we investigate the role of eye-specific signals in two common size illusions in order to provide further information about the mechanisms underlying illusory size perception.


RESULTS
we devised stimuli so that an object and its spatial context associated with illusory size perception could be presented together to one eye or separately to two eyes. we found that the ponzo illusion had an equivalent magnitude whether the objects and contexts were presented to the same or different eyes, indicating that it may be largely mediated by binocular neurons. in contrast, the ebbinghaus illusion became much weaker when objects and their contexts were presented to different eyes, indicating important contributions to the illusion from monocular neurons early in the visual pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings show that two well-known size illusions - the ponzo illusion and the ebbinghaus illusion - are mediated by different neuronal populations, and suggest that the underlying neural mechanisms associated with illusory size perception differ and can be dependent on monocular channels in the early visual pathway.
