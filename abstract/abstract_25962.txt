BACKGROUND
glucocorticoids down-regulate cytokine synthesis and suppress inflammatory responses. the glucocorticoid receptor  antagonist ru <dig> may exacerbate the inflammatory response, and concerns over this exacerbation have limited the development and clinical use of gr antagonists in the treatment of diabetes and depression. we investigated the effects of ru <dig> on serum cytokines in db/db mice and on lipopolysaccharide -induced circulating tnfα levels in both normal akr mice and diet-induced obese  c57bl/ <dig> mice.


RESULTS
chronic treatment of db/db mice with ru <dig> dose-dependently decreased blood glucose, increased serum corticosterone and acth, but did not affect serum mcp- <dig> and il- <dig> levels. lps dose-dependently increased serum tnfα in both akr and c57bl/ <dig> dio mice, along with increased circulating corticosterone and acth. pretreatment of the mice with ru <dig> dose-dependently suppressed the lps induced increases in serum tnfα and further increased serum corticosterone.


CONCLUSIONS
ru <dig> at doses that were efficacious in lowering blood glucose did not exacerbate cytokine release in these three mouse models. ru <dig> actually suppressed the lower dose lps-mediated tnfα release, possibly due to the increased release of glucocorticoids.
