BACKGROUND
african swine fever  is a contagious viral disease which can cause up to 100% mortality among domestic pigs leading to serious socio-economic impact on peopleâ€™s livelihoods. asf is endemic in uganda and there is paucity of information on the epidemiology of the disease. the major aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence and prevalence of african swine fever virus  in apparently healthy slaughter pigs at wambizi slaughterhouse in kampala city, uganda. we also estimated the presence of asfv antibodies and circulating viral antigens in pigs from selected districts of uganda during targeted surveillance. we analysed  <dig> and  <dig> blood samples collected from slaughter pigs and pigs from targeted surveillance districts respectively.


RESULTS
the prevalence of asfv in slaughter pigs was  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  by elisa and pcr respectively. in surveillance districts, the proportion of asfv positive pigs was  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  by elisa and pcr respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the study has found out a high seroprevalence of asfv antibodies in apparently healthy slaughter pigs and also a high proportion of asfv antibody seropositive pigs in surveyed districts in uganda indicating exposure to asfv. however, there was a lower prevalence of asfv infection implying that there could be low virulent strains of asfv circulating in domestic pigs in uganda which requires further investigation.
