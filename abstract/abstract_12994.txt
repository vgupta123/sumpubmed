BACKGROUND
the temporal sensitivity of the surveillance system  for bovine viral diarrhea  in danish dairy herds was evaluated. currently, the danish antibody blocking elisa is used to test quarterly bulk tank milk . to optimize the surveillance system as an early warning system, we considered the possibility of using the svanovir elisa, as this test has been shown to detect bvd-positive herds earlier than the blocking elisa in btm tests.

information from data  and outputs from two published stochastic models were fed into a stochastic scenario tree to estimate the temsse. for that purpose we considered: the risk of bvd introduction into the dairy population, the elisa used and the high risk period  from bvd introduction to testing . the effect of introducing one persistently infected  calf or one transiently infected  milking cow into  <dig>  dairy herd was investigated. additionally we estimated the confidence in low  herd prevalence  and the confidence in complete freedom  from bvd .


RESULTS
the temsse, the plow, and the pfree were higher, when tests were performed 365 days after bvd introduction, than after 90 days. estimates were usually higher for the svanovir than for the blocking elisa, and when a pi rather than a ti was introduced into the herd. for instance, with the current system, the median temsse was  <dig>  %, 90 days after a pi calf was introduced into eight dairy herds. the related median plow was  <dig>  %. when a pi calf was introduced into one herd the median temsse was  <dig>  %, while the related pfree was  <dig>  %. with the svanovir elisa these estimates were  <dig>  %;  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the replacement of the blocking elisa with the svanovir could increase the temsse, the plow and pfree remarkably. those results could be used to optimize the danish bvd surveillance system. furthermore, the approach proposed in this study, for including the effect of the hrp within the scenario tree methodology, could be applied to optimize early warning surveillance systems of different animal diseases.
