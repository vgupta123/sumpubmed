BACKGROUND
two-component systems have emerged as compelling targets for antibacterial drug design for a number of reasons including the distinct histidine phosphorylation property of their constituent sensor kinases. the devr-devs/dost two component system of mycobacterium tuberculosis  is essential for survival under hypoxia, a stress associated with dormancy development in vivo. in the present study a combinatorial peptide phage display library was screened for devs histidine kinase interacting peptides with the aim of isolating inhibitors of devr-devs signaling.


RESULTS
devs binding peptides were identified from a phage display library after three rounds of panning using devs as bait. the peptides showed sequence similarity with conserved residues in the n-terminal domain of devr and suggested that they may represent interacting surfaces between devs and devr. two devr mimetic peptides were found to specifically inhibit devr-dependent transcriptional activity and restrict the hypoxic survival of m. tb. the mechanism of peptide action is majorly attributed to an inhibition of devs autokinase activity.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings demonstrate that devr mimetic peptides impede devs activation and that intercepting devs activation at an early step in the signaling cascade impairs m. tb survival in a hypoxia persistence model.
