BACKGROUND
next generation sequencing  technologies provide exciting possibilities for whole genome sequencing of a plethora of organisms including bacterial strains and phages, with many possible applications in research and diagnostics. no streptomyces flavovirens phages have been sequenced to date; there is therefore a lack in available information about s. flavovirens phage genomics. we report biological and physiochemical features and use ngs to provide the complete annotated genomes for two new strains  of the virulent phage streptomyces flavovirens, isolated from egyptian soil samples.


RESULTS
the s. flavovirens phages  examined in this study show higher adsorption rates  than other actinophages, indicating a strong specificity to their host, and latent periods , followed by rise periods of  <dig> and  <dig> min. as expected for actinophages, their burst sizes were  <dig>  and  <dig>  virions per ml. both phages were stable and, as reported in previous experiments, showed a significant increase in their activity after sodium chloride  and magnesium chloride  treatments, whereas after zinc chloride  application both phages showed a significant decrease in infection.

the sequenced phage genomes are parts of a singleton cluster with sizes of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. bioinformatics analyses and functional characterizations enabled the assignment of possible functions to  <dig> and  <dig> putative identified orfs, which included phage structural proteins, lysis components and metabolic proteins.

thirty phams were identified in both phages,  <dig>  of them with known function, which can be used in cluster prediction. comparative genomic analysis revealed significant homology between the two phages, showing the highest hits among sf <dig>  sf <dig> and the closest streptomyces phage  in a specific 13kb region. however, the phylogenetic analysis using the major capsid protein  sequences highlighted that the isolated phages belong to the bg streptomyces phage group but are clearly separated, representing a novel sub-cluster.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study provide the first physiological and genomic information for s. flavovirens phages and will be useful for pharmaceutical industries based on s. flavovirens and future phage evolution studies.
