BACKGROUND
the lung and thyroid are derived from the anterior endoderm. retinoic acid and fgf signalling are known to be essential for development of the lung in mouse but little is known on how the lung and thyroid are specified in xenopus.


RESULTS
if either retinoic acid or fgf signalling is inhibited, there is no differentiation of the lung as assayed by expression of sftpb. there is no change in expression of thyroid gland markers when retinoic acid signalling is blocked after gastrulation and when fgf signalling is inhibited there is a short window of time where pax <dig> expression is inhibited but expression of other markers is unaffected. if exogenous retinoic acid is given to the embryo between embryonic stages  <dig> and  <dig>  the presumptive thyroid expresses sftpb and sftpc, specific markers of lung differentiation and expression of key thyroid transcription factors is lost. when the presumptive thyroid is transplanted into the posterior embryo, it also expresses sftpb, although pax <dig> expression is not blocked.


CONCLUSIONS
after gastrulation, retinoic acid is required for lung but not thyroid differentiation in xenopus while fgf signalling is needed for lung but only for early expression of pax <dig> in the thyroid. exposure to retinoic acid can cause the presumptive thyroid to switch to a lung developmental program.
