BACKGROUND
mtg <dig>  mtgr <dig> and eto are nuclear transcriptional corepressors of the human eto protein family. mtg <dig> is implicated in hematopoietic development and in controlling erythropoiesis/megakaryopoiesis. furthermore, eto homologue genes are 3'participants in leukemia fusions generated by chromosomal translocations responsible of hematopoietic dysregulation. we tried to identify structural and functional promoter elements of mtg <dig> and mtgr <dig> genes in order to find associations between their regulation and hematopoiesis.


RESULTS
5' deletion examinations and luciferase reporter gene studies indicated that a  <dig> bp sequence upstream of the transcription start site is essential for transcriptional activity by the mtg <dig> promoter. the tata- and ccaat-less promoter with a gc box close to the start site showed strong reporter activity when examined in erythroid/megakaryocytic cells. mutation of an evolutionary conserved gata - <dig> consensus binding site repressed promoter function. furthermore, results from in vitro antibody-enhanced electrophoretic mobility shift assay and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated binding of gata- <dig> to the gata - <dig> site. a role of gata- <dig> was also supported by transfection of small interfering rna, which diminished mtg <dig> expression. furthermore, expression of the transcription factor herp <dig>  which represses gata- <dig>  produced strong inhibition of the mtg <dig> promoter reporter consistent with a role of gata- <dig> in transcriptional activation. the tata-less and ccaat-less mtgr <dig> promoter retained most of the transcriptional activity within a - <dig> to - <dig> bp region with a gc-box-rich sequence containing multiple sp <dig> binding sites reminiscent of a housekeeping gene with constitutive expression. however, mutations of individual sp <dig> binding sites did not repress promoter function; multiple active sp <dig> binding sites may be required to safeguard constitutive mtgr <dig> transcriptional activity. the observed repression of mtg16/mtgr <dig> promoters by the leukemia associated aml1-eto fusion gene may have a role in hematopoietic dysfunction of leukemia.


CONCLUSIONS
an evolutionary conserved gata binding site is critical in transcriptional regulation of the mtg <dig> promoter. in contrast, the mtgr <dig> gene depends on a gc-box-rich sequence for transcriptional regulation and possible ubiquitous expression. our results demonstrate that the eto homologue promoters are regulated differently consistent with hematopoietic cell-type- specific expression and function.
