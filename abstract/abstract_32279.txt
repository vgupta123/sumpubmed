BACKGROUND
paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a thermo-dimorphic fungus that causes paracoccidiodomycosis . glycoprotein gp <dig> is the fungal main diagnostic antigen, which can also protect against murine pcm and interact with extracellular matrix proteins. it is structurally related to glucanases, however not active, and whose expression varies considerably. we have presently studied polymorphisms in the pbgp <dig> flanking regions to help understand such variations.


RESULTS
we tested the protein-binding capacity of oligonucleotides covering the pbgp <dig> proximal 5' flanking region, including overlap and mutated probes. we used electrophoretic mobility shift assays and found dna binding regions between positions - <dig> to - <dig> and - <dig> to - <dig>  only mutation at - <dig>  characteristic of p. brasiliensis phylogenetic species ps <dig>  altered binding affinity. next, we cloned and sequenced the 5' intergenic region up to position - <dig>  from p. brasiliensis pb <dig> and observed that it is composed of three tandem repetitive regions of about  <dig> bp preceded upstream by  <dig> bp. correspondent pcr fragments of about  <dig>  bp were found in eight out of fourteen isolates; in ps <dig> samples they were  <dig> -bp long due to the absence of one repetitive region, as detected in pb <dig>  we also compared fifty-six pbgp <dig> 3' utr sequences from ten isolates and have not observed polymorphisms; however we detected two main poly clusters  of multiple cleavage sites. in a single isolate we found one to seven sites.


CONCLUSIONS
we observed that the amount of pbgp <dig> transcripts accumulated in p. brasiliensis pb <dig> grown in defined medium was about  <dig> -fold higher than in pb <dig> and 120-fold higher than in pb <dig>  we have described a series of features in the gene flanking regions and differences among isolates, including dna-binding sequences, which might impact gene regulation. little is known about regulatory sequences in thermo-dimorphic fungi. the peculiar structure of tandem repetitive fragments in the 5' intergenic region of pbgp <dig>  their characteristic sequences, besides the presence of multiple poly cleavage sites in the 3' utr will certainly guide future studies.
