BACKGROUND
peroxisomes are organelles whose roles in fatty acid metabolism and reactive oxygen species elimination have contributed much attention in understanding their origin and biogenesis. many studies have shown that de novo peroxisome biogenesis is an important regulatory process, while yeast studies suggest that total peroxisome numbers are in part regulated by proteins such as pex <dig>  which can facilitate the division of existing peroxisomes. although de novo biogenesis and divisions are likely important mechanisms, the regulation of peroxisome numbers during embryonic development is poorly understood. peroxisome number and function are particularly crucial in oviparous animals such as frogs where large embryonic yolk and fatty acid stores must be quickly metabolized, and resulting reactive oxygen species eliminated. here we elucidate the role of pex11β in regulating peroxisomal gene expression and number in xenopus laevis embryogenesis.


RESULTS
microinjecting haemagglutinin  tagged pex11β in early embryos resulted in increased rna levels for peroxisome related genes pmp <dig> and catalase at developmental stages  <dig> and  <dig>  versus uninjected embryos. catalase and pmp <dig> proteins were found in punctate structures at stage  <dig> in control embryos, whereas the injection of ectopic ha-pex11β induced their earlier localization in punctate structures at stage  <dig>  furthermore, the peroxisomal marker gfp-skl, which was found localized as peroxisome-like structures at stage  <dig>  was similarly found at stage  <dig> when co-microinjected with ha-pex11β.


CONCLUSIONS
overexpressed pex11β altered peroxisomal gene levels and induced the early formation of peroxisomes-like structures during development, both of which demonstrate that pex11β may be a key regulator of peroxisome number in early xenopus embryos.
