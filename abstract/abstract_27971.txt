BACKGROUND
the native annual tobacco, nicotiana attenuata, is found primarily in large ephemeral populations  after fires in sagebrush and pinyon-juniper ecosystems and in small persistent populations  in isolated washes typically along roadsides throughout the great basin desert of the sw usa. this distribution pattern is due to its unusual germination behavior. ephemeral populations are produced by the germination of dormant seeds from long-lived seed banks which are stimulated to germinate by a combination of unidentified positive cues found in wood smoke and the removal of inhibitors leached from the unburned litter of the dominant vegetation. persistent populations may result where these inhibitors do not exist, as in washes or along disturbed roadsides. to determine if this germination behavior has influenced population structure, we conducted an aflp , issr  and issr+ aflp  analysis on plants originating from seed collected from populations growing in  <dig> wash and burns over  <dig> years from the sw usa.


RESULTS
genetic variance as measured by both issr and aflp markers was low among sites and comparatively higher within populations. cluster analysis of the utah samples with samples collected from arizona, california, and oregon as out-groups also did not reveal patterns. amova analysis of the combined aflp and issr data sets yielded significantly low genetic differentiation among sites , moderate among populations within sites  and higher genetic differentiation within populations .


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the seed dormancy of this post-fire annual and its resulting age structure in conjunction with natural selection processes are responsible for significantly low among sites and comparatively high within-population genetic variation observed in this species.
