BACKGROUND
in the androdioecious nematode caenorhabditis elegans virtually all progeny produced by hermaphrodite self-fertilization is hermaphrodite while 50% of the progeny that results from cross-fertilization by a male is male. in the standard laboratory wild type strain n <dig> males disappear rapidly from populations. this is not the case in some other wild type isolates of c. elegans, among them the hawaiian strain cb <dig> 


RESULTS
we determined the kinetics of the loss of males over time for multiple population sizes and wild isolates and found significant differences. we performed systematic inter- and intra-strain crosses with n <dig> and cb <dig> and show that the males and the hermaphrodites contribute to the difference in male maintenance between these two strains. in particular, cb <dig> males obtained a higher number of successful copulations than n <dig> males and sired correspondingly more cross-progeny. on the other hand, n <dig> hermaphrodites produced a higher number of self-progeny, both when singly mated and when not mated.


CONCLUSIONS
these two differences have the potential to explain the observed variation in male persistence, since they should lead to a predominance of self-progeny  in n <dig> and, at the same time, a high proportion of cross-progeny  in cb <dig>
