BACKGROUND
miniature inverted repeat transposable elements  are abundant non-autonomous elements, playing important roles in shaping gene and genome evolution. their characteristic structural features are suitable for automated identification by computational approaches, however, de novo mite discovery at genomic levels is still resource expensive. efficient and accurate computational tools are desirable. existing algorithms process every member of a mite family, therefore a major portion of the computing task is redundant.


RESULTS
in this study, redundant computing steps were analyzed and a novel algorithm emphasizing on the reduction of such redundant computing was implemented in mite digger. it completed processing the whole rice genome sequence database in ~ <dig> hours and produced  <dig> mite candidates with low false positive  and false negative  rates. mite digger was also tested for genome wide mite discovery with four other genomes.


CONCLUSIONS
mite digger is efficient and accurate for genome wide retrieval of mites. its user friendly interface further facilitates genome wide analyses of mites on a routine basis. the mite digger program is available at: http://labs.csb.utoronto.ca/yang/mitedigger.
