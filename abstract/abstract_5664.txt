BACKGROUND
cotton fibre quality traits such as fibre length, strength, and degree of maturation are determined by genotype and environment during the sequential phases of cotton fibre development . the cotton fibre middle lamella  is crucial for both cell adhesion and detachment processes occurring during fibre development. to explore the relationship between fibre quality and the pace at which cotton fibres develop, a structural and compositional analysis of the cfml was carried out in several cultivars with different fibre properties belonging to four commercial species: gossypium hirsutum, g. barbadense, g. herbaceum and g. arboreum.


RESULTS
cotton fibre cell adhesion, through the cotton fibre middle lamella , is a developmentally regulated process determined by genotype. the cfml is composed of de-esterified homogalacturonan, xyloglucan and arabinan in all four fibre-producing cotton species: g. hirsutum, g. barbadense, g. herbaceum and g. arboreum. conspicuous paired cell wall bulges are a feature of the cfml of two g. hirsutum cultivars from the onset of fibre cell wall detachment to the start of secondary cell wall deposition. xyloglucan is abundant in the cell wall bulges and in later stages pectic arabinan is absent from these regions.


CONCLUSIONS
the cfml of cotton fibres is re-structured during the transition phase. paired cell wall bulges, rich in xyloglucan, are significantly more evident in the g. hirsutum cultivars than in other cotton species.
