BACKGROUND
although the costs of next generation sequencing technology have decreased over
the past years, there is still a lack of simple-to-use applications, for a
comprehensive analysis of rna sequencing data. there is no one-stop shop for
transcriptomic genomics. we have developed map-rseq, a comprehensive computational
workflow that can be used for obtaining genomic features from transcriptomic
sequencing data, for any genome.


RESULTS
for optimization of tools and parameters, map-rseq was validated using both
simulated and real datasets. map-rseq workflow consists of six major modules such
as alignment of reads, quality assessment of reads, gene expression assessment and
exon read counting, identification of expressed single nucleotide variants ,
detection of fusion transcripts, summarization of transcriptomics data and final
report. this workflow is available for human transcriptome analysis and can be
easily adapted and used for other genomes. several clinical and research projects
at the mayo clinic have applied the map-rseq workflow for rna-seq studies. the
results from map-rseq have thus far enabled clinicians and researchers to
understand the transcriptomic landscape of diseases for better diagnosis and
treatment of patients.


CONCLUSIONS
our software provides gene counts, exon counts, fusion candidates, expressed
single nucleotide variants, mapping statistics, visualizations, and a detailed
research data report for rna-seq. the workflow can be executed on a standalone
virtual machine or on a parallel sun grid engine cluster. the software can be
downloaded from
