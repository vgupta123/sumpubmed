BACKGROUND
chiari-like malformation  and syringomyelia is a neurological disease complex with high prevalence in cavalier king charles spaniels . the natural progression of this disease with time has not been described. the objectives of this study were to i) determine if syringomyelia progresses with time ii) determine if features of craniocrebral morphology previously associated with cm are progressive . a retrospective morphometric analysis was undertaken in  <dig> ckcs with cm for which repeat magnetic resonance images were available without surgical intervention.


RESULTS
the maximal syrinx width, height of the foramen magnum, length of cerebellar herniation and caudal cranial fossa volume increased over time. ventricular and caudal fossa parenchymal volumes were not significantly different between scans.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study suggest that syringomyelia progresses with time. increased caudal cranial fossa volume may be associated with active resorption of the supraoccipital bone, which has previously been found in histology specimens from adult ckcs. we hypothesise that active resorption of the supraoccipital bone occurs due to pressure from the cerebellum. these findings have important implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis and variable natural clinical progression of cm and syringomyelia in ckcs.
