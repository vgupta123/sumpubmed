BACKGROUND
brd <dig> is a transcriptional regulator and belongs to bet family, a less characterized novel class of bromodomain-containing proteins. brd <dig> contains two tandem bromodomains  in the n-terminus and a conserved motif named et  domain at the c-terminus that is also present in some other bromodomain proteins. the two bromodomains have been shown to bind the acetylated histone h <dig> and to be responsible for mitotic retention on chromosomes, which is probably a distinctive feature of bet family proteins. although the crystal structure of brd <dig> bd <dig> is reported, no structure features have been characterized for brd <dig> bd <dig> and its interaction with acetylated histones.


RESULTS
here we report the solution structure of human brd <dig> bd <dig> determined by nmr. although the overall fold resembles the bromodomains from other proteins, significant differences can be found in loop regions, especially in the za loop in which a two amino acids insertion is involved in an uncommon π-helix, termed πd. the helix πd forms a portion of the acetyl-lysine binding site, which could be a structural characteristic of brd <dig> bd <dig> and other bet bromodomains. unlike brd <dig> bd <dig>  bd <dig> is monomeric in solution. with nmr perturbation studies, we have mapped the h4-ack <dig> peptide binding interface on brd <dig> bd <dig> and shown that the binding was with low affinity  and in fast exchange. using nmr and mutational analysis, we identified several residues important for the brd <dig> bd2-h4-ack <dig> peptide interaction and probed the potential mechanism for the specific recognition of acetylated histone codes by brd <dig> bd <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
brd <dig> bd <dig> is monomeric in solution and dynamically interacts with h4-ack <dig>  the additional secondary elements in the long za loop may be a common characteristic of bet bromodomains. surrounding the ligand-binding cavity, five aspartate residues form a negatively charged collar that serves as a secondary binding site for h4-ack <dig>  we suggest that brd <dig> bd <dig> and bd <dig> may possess distinctive roles and cooperate to regulate brd <dig> functions. the structure basis of brd <dig> bd <dig> will help to further characterize the functions of brd <dig> and its bet members.
