BACKGROUND
nitric oxide synthase  <dig>  contributes to neural death in some settings, but its role in glaucoma remains controversial. nos <dig> is implicated in retinal ganglion cell degeneration in a rat glaucoma model in which intraocular pressure  is experimentally elevated by blood vessel cauterization, but not in a rat glaucoma model where iop was elevated by injection of hypertonic saline. to test the importance of nos <dig> for an inherited glaucoma, in this study we both genetically and pharmacologically decreased nos <dig> activity in the dba/2j mouse glaucoma model.

methods
the expression of nos <dig> in the optic nerve head was analyzed at both the rna and protein levels at different stages of disease pathogenesis. to test the involvement of nos <dig> in glaucomatous neurodegeneration, a null allele of nos <dig> was backcrossed into dba/2j mice and the incidence and severity of glaucoma was assessed in mice of each nos <dig> genotype. additionally, dba/2j mice were treated with the nos <dig> inhibitor aminoguanidine and the disease compared to untreated mice.


RESULTS
optic nerve head nos <dig> rna levels varied and increased during moderate but decreased at early and severe stages of disease. despite the presence of a few nos <dig> positive cells in the optic nerve head, nos <dig> protein was not substantially increased during the glaucoma. genetic deficiency of nos <dig> or aminoguanidine treatment did not alter the iop profile of dba/2j mice. additionally, neither nos <dig> deficiency nor aminoguanidine had any detectable affect on the glaucomatous optic nerve damage.


CONCLUSIONS
glaucomatous neurodegeneration in dba/2j mice does not require nos <dig> activity. further experiments involving various models are needed to assess the general importance of nos <dig> in glaucoma.
