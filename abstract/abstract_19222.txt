BACKGROUND
the bacterial biofilm at the gingival margin induces a host immune reaction. in this local inflammation epithelial cells defend the host against bacterial challenge. porphyromonas gingivalis , a keystone pathogen, infects epithelial cells. the aim of this study was to investigate the activation of signaling cascades in primary epithelial cells and oral cancer cell lines by a profiler pcr array.


RESULTS
after infection with p. gingivalis membranes the rna﻿ of ﻿ <dig> to  <dig> of  <dig> key genes involved in the antibacterial immune response was up-regulated, amongst them were ikbkb , irf <dig>  and jun, map2k <dig>  mapk <dig> and mapk <dig>  in scc- <dig> cells and ikbkb, irf <dig>  jun, map2k <dig>  mapk <dig> and mapk <dig> in phgk. statistically significant up-regulation of ikbkb , map2k <dig> , mapk <dig>  and irf <dig>   was demonstrated in scc- <dig> cells and ikbkb , map2k <dig>  mapk  <dig>  , irf <dig>  and jun   were up-regulated in phgk.


CONCLUSIONS

p. gingivalis membrane up-regulates the expression of genes involved in downstream tlr, nfκb and mapk signaling pathways involved in the pro-inflammatory immune response in primary and malignant oral epithelial cells.
