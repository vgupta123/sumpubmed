BACKGROUND
neurotoxic peptides derived from the protease-resistant core of the prion protein are used to model the pathogenesis of prion diseases. the current study characterised the ingestion, internalization and intracellular trafficking of a neurotoxic peptide containing amino acids 105â€“ <dig> of the murine prion protein  in neuroblastoma cells and primary cortical neurons.


RESULTS
fluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation techniques showed that moprp105- <dig> co-localised with lipid raft markers  and trafficked intracellularly within lipid rafts. this trafficking followed a non-classical endosomal pathway delivering peptide to the golgi and er, avoiding classical endosomal trafficking via early endosomes to lysosomes. fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis demonstrated close interactions of moprp105- <dig> with cytoplasmic phospholipase a <dig>  and cyclo-oxygenase- <dig> , enzymes implicated in the neurotoxicity of prions. treatment with squalestatin reduced neuronal cholesterol levels and caused the redistribution of moprp105- <dig> out of lipid rafts. in squalestatin-treated cells, moprp105- <dig> was rerouted away from the golgi/er into degradative lysosomes. squalestatin treatment also reduced the association between moprp105- <dig> and cpla2/cox- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
as the observed shift in peptide trafficking was accompanied by increased cell survival these studies suggest that the neurotoxicity of this prp peptide is dependent on trafficking to specific organelles where it activates specific signal transduction pathways.
