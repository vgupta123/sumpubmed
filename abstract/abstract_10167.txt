BACKGROUND
serotonin  is associated with numerous behavioral and psychological factors and is a biochemical marker of mood. 5ht is involved in the hypothalamic regulation of energy consumption. 5ht controls appetite in the central nerve system  and stimulates intestinal mobility. there are few studies looking at the role of 5ht and the relationship between peripheral circulating serotonin and obesity. the aim of this study was to find any differences in leptin, adiponectin, and 5ht between lean and obese dogs and to identify correlations among these factors.


RESULTS
leptin, triglyceride  and cholesterol levels were higher in the obese group . adiponectin and 5ht levels were higher in the lean group compared to the obese group . leptin , tg  and cholesterol  were positively correlated with body condition score , and adiponectin  and 5ht  were negatively correlated with bcs. leptin was negatively correlated with adiponectin  and 5ht . 5ht was negatively correlated with leptin , tg  and cholesterol .


CONCLUSIONS
5ht is an important appetite control neurotransmitter, but there are limited studies for 5ht levels related to obesity in dogs. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate peripheral 5ht levels in obese dogs. from this research, we can assume that 5ht may be correlated with canine obesity. further studies will be needed to further elucidate the role of low serum 5ht levels in canine obesity.
