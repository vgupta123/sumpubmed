BACKGROUND
porcine enteropathogenic escherichia coli  strains of serogroup o <dig> cause post-weaning diarrhea and produce characteristic attaching and effacing  lesions. most o <dig> pepec strains possess the locus of enterocyte effacement , encoding the virulence factors required for production of a/e lesions, and often possess the paa gene, which is thought to contribute to the early stages of pepec pathogenicity. in this study, nine o <dig> pepec strains and a rabbit enteropathogenic  strain, known to produce a/e lesions in vivo, were characterized using an e. coli o157-e. coli k <dig> whole genome microarray and a virulence gene-specific microarray, and by pcr experiments.


RESULTS
based on their virulence gene profiles, the  <dig> strains were considered to be atypical epec. the differences in their genomes pointed to the identification of two distinct evolutionary groups of o <dig> pepec, groups i and ii, and provided evidence for a contribution of these genetic differences to their virulence in pigs. group i included the repec strain and four o <dig> pepec strains known to induce severe a/e lesions in challenged pigs whereas group ii was composed of the five other o <dig> pepec strains, which induced less severe or no a/e lesions in challenged pigs. significant differences between groups i and ii were found with respect to the presence or absence of  <dig> o-islands  or s-loops and  <dig> k-islands  or k-loops, including the virulence-associated islands oi# <dig> , oi# <dig> , oi# <dig> , oi# <dig> , oi# <dig>  oi# <dig>  and oi# <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
we have genetically characterized a collection of o <dig> pepec strains and classified them into two distinct groups. the differences in their virulence gene and genomic island content may influence the pathogenicity of o <dig> pepec strains, and explain why group i o <dig> pepec strains induced more severe a/e lesions in explants and challenged pigs than group ii strains.
