BACKGROUND
the antibacterial activity of bacteriophages has been described rather well. however, knowledge about the direct interactions of bacteriophages with mammalian organisms and their other, i.e. non-antibacterial, activities in mammalian systems is quite scarce. it must be emphasised that bacteriophages are natural parasites of bacteria, which in turn are parasites or symbionts of mammals . bacteriophages are constantly present in mammalian bodies and the environment in great amounts. on the other hand, the perspective of the possible use of bacteriophage preparations for antibacterial therapies in cancer patients generates a substantial need to investigate the effects of phages on cancer processes.


RESULTS
in these studies the migration of human and mouse melanoma on fibronectin was inhibited by purified t <dig> and hap <dig> bacteriophage preparations. the migration of human melanoma was also inhibited by the hap <dig> phage preparation on matrigel. no response of either melanoma cell line to lipopolysaccharide was observed. therefore the effect of the phage preparations cannot be attributed to lipopolysaccharide. no differences in the effects of t <dig> and hap <dig> on melanoma migration were observed.


CONCLUSIONS
we believe that these observations are of importance for any further attempts to use bacteriophage preparations in antibacterial treatment. the risk of antibiotic-resistant hospital infections strongly affects cancer patients and these results suggest the possibility of beneficial phage treatment. we also believe that they will contribute to the general understanding of bacteriophage biology, as bacteriophages, extremely ubiquitous entities, are in permanent contact with human organisms.
