BACKGROUND
the mitochondria of contemporary organisms contain fewer genes than the ancestral bacteria are predicted to have contained. because most of the mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus, the genes would have been transferred from the mitochondrion to the nucleus at some stage of evolution and they must have acquired cis-regulatory elements compatible with eukaryotic gene expression. however, most of such processes remain unknown.


RESULTS
the ribosomal protein l <dig> gene  has been lost in presently-known angiosperm mitochondrial genomes. we found that each of the two rice rpl <dig> genes  has an intron in an identical position within the 5'-untranslated region , which suggests a duplication of the rpl <dig> gene after its transfer to the nucleus. each of the predicted rpl <dig> proteins lacks an n-terminal extension as a mitochondrial targeting signal. transient assays using green fluorescent protein indicated that their mature n-terminal coding regions contain the mitochondrial targeting information. reverse transcription-pcr analysis showed that osrpl6- <dig> expresses considerably fewer transcripts than osrpl6- <dig>  this might be the result of differences in promoter regions because the 5'-noncoding regions of the two rpl <dig> genes differ at a point close to the center of the intron. there are several sequences homologous to the region around the 5'-utr of osrpl6- <dig> in the rice genome. these sequences have characteristics similar to those of the transposable elements  belonging to the pif/harbinger superfamily.


CONCLUSIONS
the above evidences suggest a novel mechanism in which the 5'-utr of the transferred mitochondrial gene was acquired via a te. since the 5'-utrs and introns within the 5'-utrs often contain transcriptional and posttranscriptional cis-elements, the transferred rice mitochondrial rpl <dig> gene may have acquired its cis-element from a te.
