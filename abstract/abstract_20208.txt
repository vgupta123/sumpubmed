BACKGROUND
in both women and female dogs, the most prevalent type of malignant neoplasm is the spontaneous mammary tumor. in dogs, half of these are malignant. the treatment of choice for the canine patients is surgical mastectomy. unfortunately, it often fails in high-risk, locally invasive mammary tumors as of during the time of the surgery the micro-metastases are present. moreover, there are neither large studies conducting to prove of the benefit from the chemotherapy in dogs nor established chemotherapy treatment protocols available. additionally, the effectiveness of each individual chemotherapeutic agent and drug resistance of canine mammary cancer have not yet been characterized. that has become the aim of our study, to assess the expression of pgp, bcrp, mrp <dig> and mrp <dig> in canine mammary cancer cell lines and to investigate their role in cancer resistance to vinblastine, cisplatin and cyclophosphamide with using rnai approach.


RESULTS
the results suggested that in canine mammary cancer, the vinblastine efflux was mediated by pgp and mrp <dig> proteins, cisplatin efflux was mediated by all four examined efflux pumps , whereas cyclophosphamide resistance was related to bcrp activity. rnai silencing of these efflux pumps significantly decreased ic <dig> doses of the examined drugs in canine mammary carcinoma cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our results have indicated the treatment of cells involving use of the sirna targeting efflux pumps could be a beneficial approach in the future.
