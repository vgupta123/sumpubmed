BACKGROUND
goat caseous lymphadenitis  is a chronic disease caused by corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. however, there is paucity of data about goat’s acute phase response during the course of cla. this study was conducted to investigate the response of acute phase proteins, mainly haptoglobin , serum amyloid a  and the negative acute phase response, especially albumin after an experimental challenge of c. pseudotuberculosis and phospholipase d  in cross bred boer goats.


RESULTS
serum hp concentration in goats challenged with c. pseudotuberculosis  showed a significant increase,  <dig> fold in males  and  <dig> fold in females  compared to the control . challenge with pld  also showed significant increase,  <dig> fold in males and females  respectively compared to the control . albumin concentration showed a significant decrease in both treated groups compared to the control. there were no significant changes in saa concentration between challenged and control goats.


CONCLUSIONS
there was a significant response by hp to c. pseudotuberculosis infection and pld challenge. this was supported by the early acute response in which hp was detected before cla lesions were developed. therefore, it concluded that c. pseudotuberculosis and pld can influence the level of acute phase proteins in goats.
