BACKGROUND
autotaxin  possesses lysophospholipase d  activity, which converts lysophosphatidylcholine  into lysophosphatidic acid . the atx-lpa signaling axis has been implicated in angiogenesis, chronic inflammation and tumor progression. osteopontin  is an important chemokine involved in the survival, proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer cells. the focus of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the atx-lpa axis and opn.


RESULTS
in comparison with non-treated cells, we found that the atx-lpa axis up-regulated opn expression by  <dig> -fold in protein levels and  <dig> -fold in mrna levels. the atx-lpa axis activates lpa <dig>  akt, erk and elk- <dig> and also protects sgc <dig> cells from apoptosis induced by taxol treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides the first evidence that expression of opn induced by atx-lpa axis is mediated by the activation of akt and mapk/erk pathways through the lpa <dig> receptor. in addition, opn is required for the protective effects of atx-lpa against taxol-induced apoptosis and atx-lpa-induced migration of sgc <dig> cells.
