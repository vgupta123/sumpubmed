BACKGROUND
infections with hepatitis c virus  progress to chronic phase in 80% of patients. to date, the effect produced by hcv on the expression of micrornas  involved in the interferon-β  antiviral pathway has not been explored in details. thus, we compared the expression profile of  <dig> selected mirs in ifn-β-treated huh- <dig> cells and in three different clones of huh- <dig> cells carrying a self-replicating hcv rna which express all viral proteins .

methods
the expression profile of  <dig> selected mirs in ifn-β-treated huh- <dig> cells and in hcv replicon 21- <dig> clone with respect to huh- <dig> parental cells was analysed by real-time pcr. to exclude clone specific variations, the level of  <dig> out of  <dig> mirs, found to be modulated in 21- <dig> clone, was evaluated in two other hcv replicon clones, 22- <dig> and 21- <dig>  prediction of target genes of  <dig> mirs, confirmed in all hcv clones, was performed by means of mirgator program. the gene dataset obtained from microarray analysis of hcv clones was farther used to validate target prediction.


RESULTS
the expression profile revealed that  <dig> out of  <dig> mirs were modulated in hcv replicon clone 21- <dig>  analysis in hcv replicon clones 22- <dig> and 21- <dig> indicated that  <dig> out of  <dig> mirs,  were modulated in a concerted fashion in all three hcv clones. microarray analysis revealed that  <dig> out of  <dig> genes, predicted targets of the  <dig> mirs, showed an inverse expression relationship with the corresponding mir in hcv clones, as expected for true targets. classification of the  <dig> genes by panther system indicated that the dataset contains genes involved in biological processes that sustain hcv replication and/or in pathways potentially implicated in the control of antiviral response by hcv infection.


CONCLUSIONS
the present findings reveal that  <dig> ifn-β-regulated mirs and  <dig> genes, which are likely their functional targets, were commonly modulated by hcv in three replicon clones. the future use of mir inhibitors or mimics and/or sirnas might be useful for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies aimed at the recovering of protective innate responses in hcv infections.
