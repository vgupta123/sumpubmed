BACKGROUND
mycoplasma pneumoniae is a human pathogen that is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia. it harbours a large number of lipoprotein genes, most of which are of unknown function. because of their location on the cell surface, these proteins are likely to be involved in the bacterial response to environmental changes, or in the initial stages of infection. the aim of this study was to determine if genes encoding surface lipoproteins are differentially expressed after contact with a human cell line, or after exposure to oxidative or acidic stress.


RESULTS
using qrt-pcr assays, we observed that the expression of a number of lipoprotein genes was up-regulated when m. pneumoniae was placed in contact with human cells. in contrast, lipoprotein expression was generally down-regulated or unchanged when exposed to either hydrogen peroxide or low ph . when exposed to low ph, the mrna levels of four polycistronically transcribed genes in lipoprotein multigene family  <dig> formed a gradient of decreasing quantity with increasing distance from a predicted promoter.


CONCLUSIONS
the demonstrated transcriptional changes provide evidence for the functionality of these mostly unassigned genes and indicate that they are regulated in response to changes in environmental conditions. in addition we have shown that the members of lipoprotein gene family  <dig> may be expressed polycistronically.
