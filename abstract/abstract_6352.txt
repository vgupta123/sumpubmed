BACKGROUND
the control of plant anthocyanin accumulation is via transcriptional regulation of the genes encoding the biosynthetic enzymes. a key activator appears to be an r2r <dig> myb transcription factor. in apple fruit, skin anthocyanin levels are controlled by a gene called myba or myb <dig>  while the gene determining fruit flesh and foliage anthocyanin has been termed myb <dig>  in order to further understand tissue-specific anthocyanin regulation we have isolated orthologous myb genes from all the commercially important rosaceous species.


RESULTS
we use gene specific primers to show that the three myb activators of apple anthocyanin  are likely alleles of each other. myb transcription factors, with high sequence identity to the apple gene were isolated from across the rosaceous family . key identifying amino acid residues were found in both the dna-binding and c-terminal domains of these mybs. the expression of these myb <dig> genes correlates with fruit and flower anthocyanin levels. their function was tested in tobacco and strawberry. in tobacco, these mybs were shown to induce the anthocyanin pathway when co-expressed with bhlhs, while over-expression of strawberry and apple genes in the crop of origin elevates anthocyanins.


CONCLUSIONS
this family-wide study of rosaceous r2r <dig> mybs provides insight into the evolution of this plant trait. it has implications for the development of new coloured fruit and flowers, as well as aiding the understanding of temporal-spatial colour change.
