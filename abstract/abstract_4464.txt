BACKGROUND
post-transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes can be operated through microrna  mediated gene silencing. mirnas are small  non-coding rnas that play crucial role in regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. in insects, mirnas have been shown to be involved in multiple mechanisms such as embryonic development, tissue differentiation, metamorphosis or circadian rhythm. insect mirnas have been identified in different species belonging to five orders: coleoptera, diptera, hymenoptera, lepidoptera and orthoptera.


RESULTS
we developed high throughput solexa sequencing and bioinformatic analyses of the genome of the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum in order to identify the first mirnas from a hemipteran insect. by combining these methods we identified  <dig> mirnas including  <dig> conserved and  <dig> new mirnas. moreover, we investigated the regulation of these mirnas in different alternative morphs of the pea aphid by analysing the expression of mirnas across the switch of reproduction mode. pea aphid microrna sequences have been posted to mirbase: http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/


CONCLUSIONS
our study has identified candidates as putative regulators involved in reproductive polyphenism in aphids and opens new avenues for further functional analyses.
