BACKGROUND
hypertension is a complex disease with many contributory genetic and environmental factors. we aimed to identify common targets for therapy by gene expression profiling of a resistance artery taken from animals representing two different models of hypertension. we studied gene expression and morphology of a saphenous artery branch in normotensive wky rats, spontaneously hypertensive rats  and adrenocorticotropic hormone -induced hypertensive rats.


RESULTS
differential remodeling of arteries occurred in shr and acth-treated rats, involving changes in both smooth muscle and endothelium. increased expression of smooth muscle cell growth promoters and decreased expression of growth suppressors confirmed smooth muscle cell proliferation in shr but not in acth. differential gene expression between arteries from the two hypertensive models extended to the renin-angiotensin system, map kinase pathways, mitochondrial activity, lipid metabolism, extracellular matrix and calcium handling. in contrast, arteries from both hypertensive models exhibited significant increases in caveolin- <dig> expression and decreases in the regulators of g-protein signalling, rgs <dig> and rgs <dig>  increased protein expression of caveolin- <dig> and increased incidence of caveolae was found in both smooth muscle and endothelial cells of arteries from both hypertensive models.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the majority of differences in gene expression found in the saphenous artery taken from rats with two different forms of hypertension reflect distinctive morphological and physiological alterations. however, changes in common to caveolin- <dig> expression and g protein signalling, through attenuation of rgs <dig> and rgs <dig>  may contribute to hypertension through augmentation of vasoconstrictor pathways and provide potential targets for common drug development.
