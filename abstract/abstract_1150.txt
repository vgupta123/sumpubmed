BACKGROUND
chlamydomonas reinhardtii is widely accepted as a model organism regarding photosynthesis, circadian rhythm, cell mobility, phototaxis, and biotechnology. the complete annotation of the genome allows transcriptomic studies, however a new microarray platform was needed. based on the completed annotation of chlamydomonas reinhardtii a new microarray on an agilent platform was designed using an extended jgi  <dig>  genome data set which included  <dig> transcript models.


RESULTS
in total  <dig> probes were determined  covering 93% of the transcriptome. alignment studies with the recently published augustus  <dig>  annotation confirmed  <dig> transcript models resulting in a very good coverage of 70% of the transcriptome . following the estimation of  <dig> predicted genes in chlamydomonas reinhardtii our new microarray, nevertheless, covers the expected genome by 90-95%.


CONCLUSIONS
to demonstrate the capabilities of the new microarray, we analyzed transcript levels for cultures grown under nitrogen as well as sulfate limitation, and compared the results with recently published microarray and rna-seq data. we could thereby confirm previous results derived from data on nutrient-starvation induced gene expression of a group of genes related to protein transport and adaptation of the metabolism as well as genes related to efficient light harvesting, light energy distribution and photosynthetic electron transport.
