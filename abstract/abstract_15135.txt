BACKGROUND
insect odorant binding proteins  and chemosensory proteins  play an important role in chemical communication of insects. gene discovery of these proteins is a time-consuming task. in recent years, expressed sequence tags  of many insect species have accumulated, thus providing a useful resource for gene discovery.


RESULTS
we have developed a computational pipeline to identify obp and csp genes from insect ests. in total,  <dig>  insect ests were examined from  <dig> species covering eight orders of insecta. from these ests,  <dig> obps and  <dig> csps were identified, of which  <dig> obps and  <dig> csps are new. the complete open reading frames  of  <dig> obps and  <dig> csps were obtained by electronic elongation. we randomly chose  <dig> obps from eight species of insects, and  <dig> csps from four species for rt-pcr validation. twenty two obps and  <dig> csps were confirmed by rt-pcr, proving the efficiency and reliability of the algorithm. together with all family members obtained from the ncbi  or the uniprotkb ,  <dig> obps and  <dig> csps were analyzed for their structural characteristics and evolutionary relationship.


CONCLUSIONS
a large number of new obps and csps were found, providing the basis for deeper understanding of these proteins. in addition, the conserved motif and evolutionary analysis provide some new insights into the evolution of insect obps and csps. motif pattern fine-tune the functions of obps and csps, leading to the minor difference in binding sex pheromone or plant volatiles in different insect orders.
