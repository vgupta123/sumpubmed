BACKGROUND
whales have captivated the human imagination for millennia. these incredible cetaceans are the only mammals that have adapted to life in the open oceans and have been a source of human food, fuel and tools around the globe. the transition from land to water has led to various aquatic specializations related to hairless skin and ability to regulate their body temperature in cold water.


RESULTS
we present four common minke whale  genomes with depth of ×13 ~ × <dig> coverage and perform resequencing technology without a reference sequence. our results indicated the time to the most recent common ancestors of common minke whales to be about  <dig>   million years ago. further, we found that genes associated with epilation and tooth-development showed signatures of positive selection, supporting the morphological uniqueness of whales.


CONCLUSIONS
this whole-genome sequencing offers a chance to better understand the evolutionary journey of one of the largest mammals on earth.
