BACKGROUND
computer-based pathway discovery is concerned with two important objectives: pathway identification and analysis. conventional mining and modeling approaches aimed at pathway discovery are often effective at achieving either objective, but not both. such limitations can be effectively tackled leveraging a web service-based modeling and mining approach.


RESULTS
inspired by molecular recognitions and drug discovery processes, we developed a web service mining tool, named pathexplorer, to discover potentially interesting biological pathways linking service models of biological processes. the tool uses an innovative approach to identify useful pathways based on graph-based hints and service-based simulation verifying user's hypotheses.


CONCLUSIONS
web service modeling of biological processes allows the easy access and invocation of these processes on the web. web service mining techniques described in this paper enable the discovery of biological pathways linking these process service models. algorithms presented in this paper for automatically highlighting interesting subgraph within an identified pathway network enable the user to formulate hypothesis, which can be tested out using our simulation algorithm that are also described in this paper.
