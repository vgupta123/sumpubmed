BACKGROUND
rice in tropical and sub-tropical areas is often subjected to cold stress at the seedling stage, resulting in poor growth and yield loss. although japonica rice is generally more cold tolerant  than indica rice, there are several favorable alleles for ct exist in indica that can be used to enhance ct in rice with a japonica background. genome-wide gene expression profiling is an efficient way to decipher the molecular genetic mechanisms of ct enhancement and to provide valuable information for ct improvement in rice molecular breeding. in this study, the transcriptome of the ct introgression line  k <dig> and its recurrent parent c <dig> under cold stress were comparatively analyzed to explore the possible ct enhancement mechanisms of k <dig> 


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes , including  <dig> transcription factors, were identified in both lines under cold stress. about half of these degs were commonly regulated and involved in major cold responsive pathways associated with osdreb <dig> and osmyb <dig> regulons. k354-specific cold-induced genes were functionally related to stimulus response, cellular cell wall organization, and microtubule-based movement processes that may contribute to increase ct. a set of genes encoding membrane fluidity and defensive proteins were highly enriched only in k <dig>  suggesting that they contribute to the inherent ct of k <dig>  candidate gene prediction based on introgressed regions in k <dig> revealed genotype-dependent ct enhancement mechanisms, associated with sir <dig>  osfad <dig>  oswak112d, and programmed cell death  related genes, present in ct il k <dig> but absent in its recurrent parent c <dig>  in k <dig>  a number of degs were co-localized onto introgressed segments associated with ct qtls, providing a basis for gene cloning and elucidation of molecular mechanisms responsible for ct in rice.


CONCLUSIONS
genome-wide gene expression analysis revealed that genotype-specific cold induced genes and genes with higher basal expression in the ct genotype contribute jointly to ct improvement. the molecular genetic pathways of cold stress tolerance uncovered in this study, as well as the degs co-localized with ct-related qtls, will serve as useful resources for further functional dissection of the molecular mechanisms of cold stress response in rice.
