BACKGROUND
an ovine model can cast great insight in translational neuroscientific research due to its large brain volume and distinct regional neuroanatomical structures. the present study examined the applicability of brain functional magnetic resonance imaging  and diffusion tensor imaging  to sheep using a clinical mr scanner  with a head coil. the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent  fmri was performed on anesthetized sheep during the block-based presentation of external tactile and visual stimuli using gradient echo-planar-imaging  sequence.


RESULTS
the individual as well as group-based data processing subsequently showed activation in the eloquent sensorimotor and visual areas. dti was acquired using  <dig> differential magnetic gradient directions to derive directional fractional anisotropy  and apparent diffusion coefficient  values from the brain. white matter tractography was also applied to reveal the macrostructure of the corticospinal tracts and optic radiations.


CONCLUSIONS
utilization of fmri and dti along with anatomical mri in the sheep brain could shed light on a broader use of an ovine model in the field of translational neuroscientific research targeting the brain.
