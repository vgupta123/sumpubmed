BACKGROUND
the ability of mycobacterium tuberculosis to establish a latent infection  in humans confounds the treatment of tuberculosis. consequently, there is a need to discover new therapeutic agents that can kill m. tuberculosis both during active disease and ltbi. the streptomycin-dependent strain of m. tuberculosis, 18b, provides a useful tool for this purpose since upon removal of streptomycin  it enters a non-replicating state that mimics latency both in vitro and in animal models.


RESULTS
the  <dig>  mb genome sequence of m. tuberculosis 18b was determined and this revealed the strain to belong to clade  <dig> of the ancient ancestral lineage of the beijing family. str-dependence was attributable to insertion of a single cytosine in the  <dig> loop of the 16s rrna and to a single amino acid insertion in the n-terminal domain of initiation factor  <dig>  rna-seq was used to understand the genetic programme activated upon str-withdrawal and hence to gain insight into ltbi. this revealed reconfiguration of gene expression and metabolic pathways showing strong similarities between non-replicating 18b and m. tuberculosis residing within macrophages, and with the core stationary phase and microaerophilic responses.


CONCLUSIONS
the findings of this investigation confirm the validity of 18b as a model for ltbi, and provide insight into both the evolution of tubercle bacilli and the functioning of the ribosome.
