BACKGROUND
environmental toxicants, whose actions are often mediated through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor  pathway, pose risks to the health and well-being of exposed species, including humans. of particular concern are exposures during the earliest stages of development that while failing to abrogate embryogenesis, may have long term effects on newborns or adults. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of maternal exposure to the ahr-specific ligand  <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin  on the development of rat pre-implantation embryos with respect to nuclear and cytoskeletal architecture and cell lineage allocation.


RESULTS
we performed a systematic  <dig> dimensional  confocal microscopy analysis of rat pre-implantation embryos following maternal exposure to environmentally relevant doses of tcdd. both chronic  and acute  maternal tcdd exposure disrupted morphogenesis at the compaction stage , with defects including monopolar spindle formation, f-actin capping and fragmentation due to aberrant cytokinesis. additionally, the size, shape and position of nuclei were modified in compaction stage pre-implantation embryos collected from treated animals. notably, maternal tcdd exposure did not compromise survival to blastocyst, which with the exception of nuclear shape, were morphologically similar to control blastocysts.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified the compaction stage of pre-implantation embryogenesis as critically sensitive to the effects of tcdd, while survival to the blastocyst stage is not compromised. to the best of our knowledge this is the first in vivo study to demonstrate a critical window of pre-implantation mammalian development that is vulnerable to disruption by an ahr ligand at environmentally relevant doses.
