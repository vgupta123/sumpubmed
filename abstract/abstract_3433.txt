BACKGROUND
as a cellular membrane triggering receptor, cd <dig> is involved in the nk cell- or ctl-mediated lysis of tumor cells of different origin, including freshly isolated tumor cells and tumor cell lines. here, we evaluated soluble cd <dig>  levels in sera, and membrane cd <dig>  expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells  from cancer patients as well as normal subjects, and demonstrated the possible function and origin of the altered scd <dig>  which may provide useful information for understanding the mechanisms of tumor escape and for immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy.


RESULTS
soluble cd <dig> levels in serum samples from cancer patients were significantly higher than those in healthy individuals , while cancer patients exhibited lower pbmc mcd <dig> expression than healthy individuals . cd226-fc fusion protein could significantly inhibit the cytotoxicity of nk cells against k <dig> cells in a dose-dependent manner. furthermore, three kinds of protease inhibitors could notably increase mcd <dig> expression on pma-stimulated pbmcs and jurkat cells with a decrease in the scd <dig> level in the cell culture supernatant.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that scd <dig> might be shed from cell membranes by certain proteases, and, further, scd <dig> may be used as a predictor for monitoring cancer, and more important, a possible immunotherapy target, which may be useful in clinical application.
