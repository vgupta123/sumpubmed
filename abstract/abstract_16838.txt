BACKGROUND
gene expression profiles based on microarray data have been suggested by many studies as potential molecular prognostic indexes of breast cancer. however, due to the confounding effect of clinical background, independent studies often obtained inconsistent results. the current study investigated the possibility to improve the quality and generality of expression profiles by integrated analysis of multiple datasets. profiles of recurrence outcome were derived from two independent datasets and validated by a third dataset.


RESULTS
the clinical background of patients significantly influenced the content and performance of expression profiles when the training samples were unbalanced. the integrated profiling of two independent datasets lead to higher classification accuracy  and larger roc curve area  of the testing samples. cell cycle, especially m phase mitosis, was significantly overrepresented by the 60-gene profile obtained from integrated analysis . this profiles significantly differentiated poor and good prognosis in a third patient cohort . simulation procedures demonstrated that the change of profile specificity had more instant influence on the performance of expression profiles than the change of profile sensitivity.


CONCLUSIONS
the current study confirmed that the gene expression profile generated by integrated analysis of multiple datasets achieved better prediction of breast cancer recurrence. however, the content and performance of profiles was confounded by clinical background of training patients. in future studies, prognostic profile applicable to the general population should be derived from more diversified and balanced patient cohorts in larger scale.
