BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  is a gram-negative pathogen that must successfully adapt to the broad fluctuations in the concentration of dissolved dioxygen encountered in the host. in escherichia coli, arca  helps the cells to sense and respond to the presence of dioxygen. the global role of arca in e. coli is well characterized; however, little is known about its role in anaerobically grown s. typhimurium.


RESULTS
we compared the transcriptional profiles of the virulent wild-type  strain  and its isogenic arca mutant grown under anaerobic conditions. we found that arca directly or indirectly regulates  <dig> genes ; of these,  <dig> genes are poorly characterized. regulation by arca in s. typhimurium is similar, but distinct from that in e. coli. thus, genes/operons involved in core metabolic pathways  were regulated similarly in the two organisms. however, genes/operons present in both organisms, but regulated differently by arca in s. typhimurium included those coding for ethanolamine utilization, lactate transport and metabolism, and succinate dehydrogenases. salmonella-specific genes/operons regulated by arca included those required for propanediol utilization, flagellar genes , gifsy- <dig> prophage genes, and three spi- <dig> genes . in agreement with our microarray data, the arca mutant was non-motile, lacked flagella, and was as virulent in mice as the wt. additionally, we identified a set of  <dig> genes whose regulation was shared with the anaerobic redox regulator, fnr.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified the arca regulon in anaerobically grown s. typhimurium. our results demonstrated that in s. typhimurium, arca serves as a transcriptional regulator coordinating cellular metabolism, flagella biosynthesis, and motility. furthermore, arca and fnr share in the regulation of  <dig> s. typhimurium genes.
