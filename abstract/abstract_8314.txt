BACKGROUND
soybean is one of the most important oil crops. the regulatory genes involved in oil accumulation are largely unclear. we initiated studies to identify genes that regulate this process.


RESULTS
one myb-type gene gmmyb <dig> was found to display differential expression in soybean seeds of different developing stages by microarray analysis and was further investigated for its functions in lipid accumulation. gmmyb <dig> is a small protein with single myb repeat and has similarity to cpc-like myb proteins from arabidopsis. gmmyb <dig> interacted with gl <dig> and egl <dig>  and then suppressed gl <dig>  a negative regulator of oil accumulation. gmmyb <dig> overexpression enhanced lipid contents in both seeds and leaves of transgenic arabidopsis plants. seed length and thousand-seed weight were also promoted. gmmyb <dig> introduction into the arabidopsis try cpc double mutant rescued the total lipids, seed size and thousand-seed weight. gmmyb <dig> also elevated lipid levels in seeds and leaves of transgenic lotus, and in transgenic hairy roots of soybean plants. gmmyb <dig> promoted pldα <dig> expression, whose promoter can be bound and inhibited by gl <dig>  pldα <dig> mutation reduced triacylglycerol levels mildly in seeds but significantly in leaves of arabidopsis plants.


CONCLUSIONS
gmmyb <dig> may reduce gl <dig>  and then release gl2-inhibited pldα <dig> expression for lipid accumulation. manipulation of gmmyb <dig> may potentially improve oil production in legume crop plants.
