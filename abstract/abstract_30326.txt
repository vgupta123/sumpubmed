BACKGROUND
the gtr <dig> protein of saccharomyces cerevisiae is a member of the raga subfamily of the ras-like small gtpase superfamily. gtr <dig> has been implicated in various cellular processes. particularly, the switch regions in the gtpase domain of gtr <dig> are essential for torc <dig> activation and amino acid signaling. therefore, knowledge about the biochemical activity of gtr <dig> is required to understand its mode of action and regulation.


RESULTS
by employing tryptophan fluorescence analysis and radioactive gtpase assays, we demonstrate that gtr <dig> can adopt two distinct gdp- and gtp-bound conformations, and that it hydrolyses gtp much slower than ras proteins. using cysteine mutagenesis of arginine- <dig> and valine- <dig>  residues at the switch i and ii regions, respectively, we show altered gtpase activity and associated conformational changes as compared to the wild type protein and the cysteine-less mutant.


CONCLUSIONS
the extremely low intrinsic gtpase activity of gtr <dig> implies requirement for interaction with activating proteins to support its physiological function. these findings as well as the altered properties obtained by mutagenesis in the switch regions provide insights into the function of gtr <dig> and its homologues in yeast and mammals.
