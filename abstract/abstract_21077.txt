BACKGROUND
the aim of this study was to analyze the effects of transition out of and into daylight saving time on the rest-activity cycles and sleep. rest-activity cycles of nine healthy participants aged  <dig> to  <dig> years were measured around transitions out of and into daylight saving time on fall  <dig> and spring  <dig> respectively. rest-activity cycles were measured using wrist-worn accelerometers. the participants filled in the morningness-eveningness and seasonal pattern assessment questionnaires before starting the study and kept a sleep diary during the study.


RESULTS
fall transition was more disturbing for the more morning type and spring transition for the more evening type of persons. individuals having a higher global seasonality score suffered more from the transitions.


CONCLUSIONS
transitions out of and into daylight saving time enhanced night-time restlessness and thereby compromised the quality of sleep.
