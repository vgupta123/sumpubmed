BACKGROUND
kernel weight and size are important components of grain yield in cereals. although some information is available concerning the map positions of quantitative trait loci  for kernel weight and size in maize, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of these qtls. qgw <dig>  is a major qtl that is associated with kernel weight and size in maize. we combined linkage analysis and association mapping to fine-map and identify candidate gene at qgw <dig> .


RESULTS
qtl qgw <dig>  was fine-mapped to a  <dig> -kb interval in a segregating population derived from a cross of huangzaosi with lv <dig>  by combining the results of regional association mapping and linkage analysis, we identified grmzm2g <dig> as a candidate gene responsible for qgw <dig> . candidate gene-based association mapping was conducted using a panel of  <dig> inbred lines with variable kernel weights and kernel sizes. six polymorphic sites in the gene grmzm2g <dig> were significantly associated with kernel weight and kernel size.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of linkage analysis and association mapping revealed that grmzm2g <dig> is the most likely candidate gene for qgw <dig> . these results will improve our understanding of the genetic architecture and molecular mechanisms underlying kernel development in maize.
