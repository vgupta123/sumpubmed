BACKGROUND
plant wrky dna-binding transcription factors are involved in plant responses to biotic and abiotic responses. it has been previously shown that arabidopsis wrky <dig> and wrky <dig>  which encode two structurally similar wrky transcription factors, are induced by pathogen infection and salicylic acid . however, the role of the two wrky transcription factors in plant disease resistance has not been directly analyzed.


RESULTS
both wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> are nuclear-localized and specifically recognize the ttgacc w-box sequences in vitro. expression of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> was induced rapidly by stress conditions generated by liquid infiltration or spraying. stress-induced expression of wrky <dig> was further elevated by pathogen infection and sa treatment. to determine directly their role in plant disease resistance, we have isolated t-dna insertion mutants and generated transgenic overexpression lines for wrky <dig> and wrky <dig>  both the loss-of-function mutants and transgenic overexpression lines were examined for responses to the biotrophic bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae and the necrotrophic fungal pathogen botrytis cinerea. the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> single and double mutants exhibited more severe disease symptoms and support higher fungal growth than wild-type plants after botrytis infection. although disruption of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> did not have a major effect on plant response to p. syringae, overexpression of wrky <dig> greatly enhanced plant susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen and suppressed pathogen-induced pr <dig> gene expression.


CONCLUSIONS
the nuclear localization and sequence-specific dna-binding activity support that wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> function as transcription factors. functional analysis based on t-dna insertion mutants and transgenic overexpression lines indicates that wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> have a positive role in plant resistance to necrotrophic pathogens and wrky <dig> has a negative effect on plant resistance to biotrophic pathogens.
