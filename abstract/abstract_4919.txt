BACKGROUND
genes at the major histocompatibility complex  are known for high levels of polymorphism maintained by balancing selection. in small or bottlenecked populations, however, genetic drift may be strong enough to overwhelm the effect of balancing selection, resulting in reduced mhc variability. in this study we investigated mhc evolution in two recently diverged bird species: the endemic gal치pagos hawk , which occurs in small, isolated island populations, and its widespread mainland relative, the swainson's hawk .


RESULTS
we amplified at least two mhc class ii b gene copies in each species. we recovered only three different sequences from  <dig> gal치pagos hawks, while we amplified  <dig> unique sequences in  <dig> swainson's hawks. most of the sequences clustered into two groups in a phylogenetic network, with one group likely representing pseudogenes or nonclassical loci. neutral genetic diversity at  <dig> microsatellite loci was also reduced in the gal치pagos hawk compared to the swainson's hawk.


CONCLUSIONS
the corresponding loss in neutral diversity suggests that the reduced variability present at gal치pagos hawk mhc class ii b genes compared to the swainson's hawk is primarily due to a founder event followed by ongoing genetic drift in small populations. however, purifying selection could also explain the low number of mhc alleles present. this lack of variation at genes involved in the adaptive immune response could be cause for concern should novel diseases reach the archipelago.
