BACKGROUND
a new priority in genome research is large-scale resequencing of genes to understand the molecular basis of hereditary disease and cancer. we assessed the ability of massively parallel pyrosequencing to identify sequence variants in pools. from a large collection of human pcr samples we selected  <dig> pcr products belonging to  <dig> disease genes and including a large spectrum of sequence variations previously identified by sanger sequencing. the sequence variants included snps and small deletions and insertions , in homozygous or heterozygous state.


RESULTS
the dna was combined in  <dig> pools containing from  <dig> to  <dig> amplicons and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb to sequence for a total of  <dig> kb. pyrosequencing generated over  <dig> million base pairs of data. blind searching for sequence variations with a specifically designed bioinformatics procedure identified  <dig> putative sequence variants, including  <dig> true variants,  <dig> false positives , no false negatives. all known variants in positions covered with at least 30Ã— depth were correctly recognized.


CONCLUSIONS
massively parallel pyrosequencing may be used to simplify and speed the search for dna variations in pcr products. our results encourage further studies to evaluate molecular diagnostics applications.
