BACKGROUND
the analysis of complex diseases is an important problem in human genetics. because multifactoriality is expected to play a pivotal role, many studies are currently focused on collecting information on the genetic and environmental factors that potentially influence these diseases. however, there is still a lack of efficient and thoroughly tested statistical models that can be used to identify implicated features and their interactions. simulations using large biologically realistic data sets with known gene-gene and gene-environment interactions that influence the risk of a complex disease are a convenient and useful way to assess the performance of statistical methods.


RESULTS
the gene-environment interaction simulator  <dig>  simulates interactions among two genetic and one environmental factor and also allows for epistatic interactions. gens <dig> is based on data with realistic patterns of linkage disequilibrium, and imposes no limitations either on the number of individuals to be simulated or on number of non-predisposing genetic/environmental factors to be considered. the gens <dig> tool is able to simulate gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. to make the simulator more intuitive, the input parameters are expressed as standard epidemiological quantities. gens <dig> is written in python language and takes advantage of operators and modules provided by the simupop simulation environment. it can be used through a graphical or a command-line interface and is freely available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/gensim. the software is released under the gnu general public license version  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
data produced by gens <dig> can be used as a benchmark for evaluating statistical tools designed for the identification of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.
