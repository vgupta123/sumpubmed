BACKGROUND
tnt <dig> was the first active plant retrotransposon identified in tobacco after nitrate reductase gene disruption. the tnt <dig> superfamily comprises elements from nicotiana  and lycopersicon  species. the study presented here was conducted to characterise tnt1-related sequences in  <dig> wild species of solanum and five cultivars of solanum tuberosum.


RESULTS
tnt1-related sequences were amplified from total genomic dna using a pcr-based approach. purified fragments were cloned and sequenced, and clustering analysis revealed three groups that differ in their u <dig> region. using a network approach with a total of  <dig> non-redundant sequences isolated from solanum , nicotiana  and lycopersicon  species, it is demonstrated that the tnt <dig> superfamily can be treated as a population to resolve previous phylogenetic multifurcations. the resulting rnaseh network revealed that sequences group according to the solanaceae genus, supporting a strong association with the host genome, whereas tracing the u <dig> region sequence association characterises the modular evolutionary pattern within the tnt <dig> superfamily. within each genus, and irrespective of species, nearly 20% of tnt <dig> sequences analysed are identical, indicative of being part of an active copy. the network approach enabled the identification of putative "master" sequences and provided evidence that within a genus these master sequences are associated with distinct u <dig> regions.


CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here support the hypothesis that the tnt <dig> superfamily was present early in the evolution of solanaceae. the evidence also suggests that the rnaseh region of tnt <dig> became fixed at the host genus level whereas, within each genus, propagation was ensured by the diversification of the u <dig> region. different selection pressures seemed to have acted on the u <dig> and rnaseh modules of ancestral tnt <dig> elements, probably due to the distinct functions of these regions in the retrotransposon life cycle, resulting in both co evolution and adaptation of the element population with its host.
