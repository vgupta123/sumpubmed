BACKGROUND
the six <dig> homeobox gene is highly expressed in the embryonic mammary gland, continues to be expressed in early postnatal mammary development, but is lost when the mammary gland differentiates during pregnancy. however, six <dig> is re-expressed in breast cancers, suggesting that its re-instatement in the adult mammary gland may contribute to breast tumorigenesis via initiating a developmental process out of context. indeed, recent studies demonstrate that six <dig> overexpression in the adult mouse mammary gland is sufficient for initiating invasive carcinomas, and that its overexpression in xenograft models of mammary cancer leads to metastasis. these data demonstrate that six <dig> is causally involved in both breast tumorigenesis and metastasis, thus raising the possibility that it may be a viable therapeutic target. however, because six <dig> is highly expressed in the developing mammary gland, and because it has been implicated in the expansion of mammary stem cells, targeting six <dig> as an anti-cancer therapy may have unwanted side effects in the breast.


RESULTS
we sought to determine the role of six <dig> in mammary development using two independent mouse models. to study the effect of six <dig> loss in early mammary development when six <dig> is normally expressed, six1-/- embryonic mammary glands were transplanted into rag1-/- mice. in addition, to determine whether six <dig> downregulation is required during later stages of development to allow for proper differentiation, we overexpressed six <dig> during adulthood using an inducible, mammary-specific transgenic mouse model. morphogenesis of the mammary gland occurred normally in animals transplanted with six1-/- embryonic mammary glands, likely through the redundant functions of other six family members such as six <dig> and six <dig>  whose expression was increased in response to six <dig> loss. surprisingly, inappropriate expression of six <dig> in the adult mammary gland, when levels are normally low to absent, did not inhibit normal mammary differentiation during pregnancy or lactation.


CONCLUSIONS
six <dig> is not critical for normal mammary gland development, since neither loss nor inappropriate overexpression of six <dig> adversely affects normal mammary gland development or function. however, as both six <dig> and six <dig> levels are increased in six1-/- mammary glands, we postulate that these six family members are functionally redundant in the gland, as is true of many homeobox gene families. this data, in conjunction with recent findings that six <dig> is capable of promoting breast cancer initiation and progression, suggest that six <dig> may serve as a reasonable chemotherapeutic target in a clinical setting, particularly for those women diagnosed with breast cancer in their childbearing years.
