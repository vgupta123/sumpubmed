BACKGROUND
duchenne muscular dystrophy  is an x-linked genetic disorder that results in the production of a dysfunctional form of the protein, dystrophin. the mdx5cv mouse is a model of dmd in which a point mutation in exon  <dig> of the dystrophin gene creates an artificial splice site. as a result, a  <dig> base pair deletion of exon  <dig> occurs with a coincident creation of a frameshift and a premature stop codon. using primary myoblasts from mdx5cv mice, single-stranded dna oligonucleotides were designed to correct this dna mutation.


RESULTS
single-stranded dna oligonucleotides that were designed to repair this splice site mutation corrected the mutation in the gene and restored expression of wild-type dystrophin. this repair was validated at the dna, rna and protein level. we also report that the frequency of genetic repair of the mdx mutation can be enhanced if rnai is used to suppress expression of the recombinase inhibitor protein msh <dig> in cultures containing myoblasts but not in those heavily enriched in myoblasts.


CONCLUSIONS
exogenous manipulations, such as rnai, are certainly feasible and possibly required to increase the successful application of gene repair in some primary or progenitor muscle cells.
