BACKGROUND
understanding how embryos specify asymmetric axes is a major focus of biology. while much has been done to discover signaling pathways and transcription factors important for axis specification, comparatively little is known about how epigenetic regulators are involved. epigenetic regulators operate downstream of signaling pathways and transcription factors to promote nuclear processes, most prominently transcription. to discover novel functions for these complexes in axis establishment during early embryonic development, we characterized phenotypes of a mouse knockout  allele of the chromatin remodeling ino <dig> atpase.


RESULTS
ino <dig> ko embryos implant, but fail to develop beyond the egg cylinder stage. ino <dig> ko embryonic stem cells  are viable and maintain alkaline phosphatase activity, which is suggestive of pluripotency, but they fail to fully differentiate as either embryoid bodies or teratomas. gene expression analysis of ino <dig> ko early embryos by in situ hybridization and embryoid bodies by rt-pcr shows elevated bmp <dig> expression and reduced expression of distal visceral endoderm  markers cer <dig>  hex, and lefty <dig>  in culture, bmp <dig> maintains stem cell pluripotency and when overexpressed is a known negative regulator of dve differentiation in the early embryo. consistent with the early embryo, we observed upregulated bmp <dig> expression and down-regulated cer <dig>  hex, and lefty <dig> expression when ino <dig> ko escs are differentiated in a monolayer. molecular studies in these same cells demonstrate that ino <dig> bound to the bmp <dig> promoter regulates its chromatin structure, which correlates with enhanced sp <dig> binding. these results in combination suggest that ino <dig> directly regulates the chromatin structure of the bmp <dig> promoter with consequences to gene expression.


CONCLUSIONS
in contrast to ino <dig> ko differentiated cells, our experiments show that undifferentiated ino <dig> ko escs are viable, but fail to differentiate in culture and in the early embryo. ino <dig> ko escs and the early embryo up-regulate bmp <dig> expression and down-regulate the expression of dve markers cer <dig>  hex and lefty <dig>  based on this data, we propose a model where the ino <dig> chromatin remodeling complex represses bmp <dig> expression in the early embryo, thus promoting dve differentiation and successful proximal-distal axis establishment. these results are significant because they show that epigenetic regulators have specific roles in establishing embryonic axes. by further characterizing these complexes, we will deepen our understanding of how the mammalian embryo is patterned by epigenetic regulators.
