BACKGROUND
il- <dig> has a potent inhibitory effect on osteoclastogenesis. in vitro and in vivo studies confirm the importance of this cytokine in bone metabolism, for instance il-10-deficient mice develop the hallmarks of osteoporosis. although it is known that il- <dig> directly inhibits osteoclastogenesis at an early stage, preventing differentiation of osteoclast progenitors to preosteoclasts, the precise mechanism of its action is not yet clear. several major pathways regulate osteoclastogenesis, with key signalling genes such as p <dig>  traf <dig>  nf-κb and nfatc <dig> well established as playing vital roles. we have looked at gene expression in eleven of these genes using real-time quantitative pcr on rna extracted from rankl-treated raw <dig>  monocytes.


RESULTS
there was no downregulation by il- <dig> of dap <dig>  fcγriib, c-jun, rank, traf <dig>  p <dig>  nf-κb, gab <dig>  pim- <dig>  or c-fos at the mrna level. however, we found that il- <dig> significantly reduces rankl-induced nfatc <dig> expression. nfatc <dig> is transcribed from two alternative promoters in mus musculus and, interestingly, only the variant transcribed from promoter p <dig> and beginning with exon  <dig> was downregulated by il- <dig> . in addition, immunofluorescence studies showed that il- <dig> reduces nfatc <dig> levels in rankl-treated precursors and suppresses nuclear translocation. the inhibitory effect of il- <dig> on tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cell number and nfatc <dig> mrna expression was reversed by the protein kinase c agonist phorbol myristate acetate, providing evidence that interleukin- <dig> disrupts nfatc <dig> activity through its effect on ca2+ mobilisation.


CONCLUSIONS
il- <dig> acts directly on mononuclear precursors to inhibit nfatc <dig> expression and nuclear translocation, and we provide evidence that the mechanism may involve disruption of ca2+ mobilisation. we detected downregulation only of the nfatc <dig> isoform  <dig> transcribed from promoter p <dig>  this is the first report indicating that one of the ways in which il- <dig> directly inhibits osteoclastogenesis is by suppressing nfatc <dig> activity.
