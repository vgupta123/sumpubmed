BACKGROUND
panax ginseng c. a. meyer is one of the most widely used medicinal plants. complete genome information for this species remains unavailable due to its large genome size. at present, analysis of expressed sequence tags is still the most powerful tool for large-scale gene discovery. the global expressed sequence tags from p. ginseng tissues, especially those isolated from stems, leaves and flowers, are still limited, hindering in-depth study of p. ginseng.


RESULTS
two  <dig> pyrosequencing runs generated a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads from p. ginseng roots, stems, leaves and flowers. the high-quality reads from each of the tissues were independently assembled into separate and shared contigs. in the separately assembled database,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were only found in the roots, stems, leaves and flowers database, respectively. in the jointly assembled database,  <dig>  unigenes were observed, including  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. among the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>  were identified for the first time, of which  <dig> % were identified in the stem, leaf or flower cdna libraries of p. ginseng. after annotation, we discovered  <dig> unigenes involved in ginsenoside backbone biosynthesis. additionally, a total of  <dig> potential cytochrome p <dig> and  <dig> potential udp-glycosyltransferase sequences were predicted based on the annotation results, some of which may encode enzymes responsible for ginsenoside backbone modification. a blast search of the obtained high-quality reads identified  <dig> potential micrornas in p. ginseng, which were estimated to target  <dig> protein-coding genes, including transcription factors, transporters and dna binding proteins, among others. in addition, a total of  <dig>  simple sequence repeats were identified from the  <dig>  unigenes.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides global expressed sequence tags for p. ginseng, which will contribute significantly to further genome-wide research and analyses in this species. the novel unigenes identified here enlarge the available p. ginseng gene pool and will facilitate gene discovery. in addition, the identification of micrornas and the prediction of targets from this study will provide information on gene transcriptional regulation in p. ginseng. finally, the analysis of simple sequence repeats will provide genetic makers for molecular breeding and genetic applications in this species.
