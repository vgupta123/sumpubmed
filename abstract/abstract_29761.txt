BACKGROUND
the fate of hydrogen peroxide  in the endoplasmic reticulum  has been inferred indirectly from the activity of er-localized thiol oxidases and peroxiredoxins, in vitro, and the consequences of their genetic manipulation, in vivo. over the years hints have suggested that glutathione, puzzlingly abundant in the er lumen, might have a role in reducing the heavy burden of h2o <dig> produced by the luminal enzymatic machinery for disulfide bond formation. however, limitations in existing organelle-targeted h2o <dig> probes have rendered them inert in the thiol-oxidizing er, precluding experimental follow-up of glutathione’s role in er h2o <dig> metabolism.


RESULTS
here we report on the development of triper, a vital optical probe sensitive to changes in the concentration of h2o <dig> in the thiol-oxidizing environment of the er. consistent with the hypothesized contribution of oxidative protein folding to h2o <dig> production, er-localized triper detected an increase in the luminal h2o <dig> signal upon induction of pro-insulin , which was attenuated by the ectopic expression of catalase in the er lumen. interfering with glutathione production in the cytosol by buthionine sulfoximine  or enhancing its localized destruction by expression of the glutathione-degrading enzyme chac <dig> in the lumen of the er further enhanced the luminal h2o <dig> signal and eroded β-cell viability.


CONCLUSIONS
a tri-cysteine system with a single peroxidatic thiol enables h2o <dig> detection in oxidizing milieux such as that of the er. tracking er h2o <dig> in live pancreatic β-cells points to a role for glutathione in h2o <dig> turnover.
