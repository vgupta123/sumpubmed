BACKGROUND
very few closed genomes of the cyanobacteria that commonly produce toxic blooms in lakes and reservoirs are available, limiting our understanding of the properties of these organisms. a new anatoxin-a-producing member of the nostocaceae, anabaena sp. wa <dig>  was isolated from a freshwater lake in washington state, usa, in  <dig> and maintained in non-axenic culture.


RESULTS
the anabaena sp. wa <dig>  <dig>  mbp genome assembly has been closed with long-read, single-molecule sequencing and separately a draft genome assembly has been produced with short-read sequencing technology. the closed and draft genome assemblies are compared, showing a correlation between long repeats in the genome and the many gaps in the short-read assembly. anabaena sp. wa <dig> encodes anatoxin-a biosynthetic genes, as does its close relative anabaena sp. al <dig> . these strains are distinguished by differences in the genes for light-harvesting phycobilins, with anabaena sp. al <dig> possessing a phycoerythrocyanin operon. biologically relevant structural variants in the anabaena sp. wa <dig> genome were detected only by long-read sequencing: a tandem triplication of the anabcd promoter region in the anatoxin-a synthase gene cluster  and a 5-kbp deletion variant present in two-thirds of the population. the genome has a large number of mobile elements . strikingly, there was no synteny with the genome of its nearest fully assembled relative, anabaena sp.  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
structural and functional genome analyses indicate that anabaena sp. wa <dig> has a flexible genome. genome closure, which can be readily achieved with long-read sequencing, reveals large scale  and local structural features that should be considered in understanding genome evolution and function.
