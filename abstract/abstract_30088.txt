BACKGROUND
bv <dig>  prokineticin- <dig>  or endocrine gland-vascular endothelial growth factor, and prokineticin- <dig> are recently isolated peptide agonists of two g protein-coupled receptors, prokineticin receptor- <dig>  and prokr  <dig>  and have been described as affecting a number of myeloid cell functions. we evaluated the impact of bv <dig> on lymphoid cells by investigating its ability to modulate t cell cytokine balance in mouse.


RESULTS
the production of t-helper <dig> cytokines , the t-helper  <dig> cytokine il- <dig>  and the anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> by mouse splenocytes was evaluated after polyclonal stimulation or immunisation with the keyhole limpet hemocyanin protein antigen by measuring cytokine levels. when added in vitro to con-a-stimulated splenocytes, bv <dig> significantly increased il-1β and decreased il- <dig> and il-10; il- <dig> and ifn-γ were not affected. similar results were obtained when bv <dig> was administered in vivo. in klh-immunised mice, splenocytes restimulated in vitro with klh and bv <dig> produced significantly smaller amounts of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  klh-induced il- <dig> and il- <dig> production was also significantly blunted in animals administered bv <dig> in vivo at the time of klh immunisation or two weeks later. the bv8-induced effects were lost in mice lacking the prokr  <dig> gene, thus indicating that prokr  <dig> is the receptor involved in the modulation of cytokines.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings indicate that bv8/prokineticin- <dig> is a novel modulator of lymphoid functions, and may be a suitable target for new immunopharmacological strategies.
