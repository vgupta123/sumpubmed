BACKGROUND
cysteine-rich protein  <dig>  is a lim domain containing protein localized to the nucleus and the actin cytoskeleton. crp <dig> has been demonstrated to bind the actin-bundling protein α-actinin and proposed to modulate the actin cytoskeleton; however, specific regulatory mechanisms have not been identified.


RESULTS
crp <dig> expression increased actin bundling in rat embryonic fibroblasts. although crp <dig> did not affect the bundling activity of α-actinin, crp <dig> was found to stabilize the interaction of α-actinin with actin bundles and to directly bundle actin microfilaments. using confocal and photobleaching fluorescence resonance energy transfer  microscopy, we demonstrate that there are two populations of crp <dig> localized along actin stress fibers, one associated through interaction with α-actinin and one that appears to bind the actin filaments directly. consistent with a role in regulating actin filament cross-linking, crp <dig> also localized to the membrane ruffles of spreading and pdgf treated fibroblasts.


CONCLUSIONS
crp <dig> regulates actin filament bundling by directly cross-linking actin filaments and stabilizing the interaction of α-actinin with actin filament bundles.
