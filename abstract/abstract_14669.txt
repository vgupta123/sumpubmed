BACKGROUND
recently, questions have been raised regarding the ability of animal models to recapitulate human disease at the molecular level. it has also been demonstrated that cellular kinases, individually or as a collective unit , play critical roles in regulating complex biology. despite the intimate relationship between kinases and health, little is known about the variability, consistency and stability of kinome profiles across species and individuals.


RESULTS
as a preliminary investigation of the existence of species- and individual-specific kinotypes , peptide arrays were employed for the analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected weekly from human and porcine subjects  over a one month period. the data revealed strong evidence for species-specific signalling profiles. both humans and pigs also exhibited evidence for individual-specific kinome profiles that were independent of natural changes in blood cell populations.


CONCLUSIONS
species-specific kinotypes could have applications in disease research by facilitating the selection of appropriate animal models or by revealing a baseline kinomic signature to which treatment-induced profiles could be compared. similarly, individual-specific kinotypes could have implications in personalized medicine, where the identification of molecular patterns or signatures within the kinome may depend on both the levels of kinome diversity and temporal stability across individuals.
