BACKGROUND
in this paper, we study the problem of rna motif search in long genomic sequences. this approach uses a combination of sequence and structure constraints to uncover new distant homologs of known functional rnas. the problem is np-hard and is traditionally solved by backtracking algorithms.


RESULTS
we have designed a new algorithm for rna motif search and implemented a new motif search tool rnarobo. the tool enhances the rnabob descriptor language, allowing insertions in helices, which enables better characterization of ribozymes and aptamers. a typical rna motif consists of multiple elements and the running time of the algorithm is highly dependent on their ordering. by approaching the element ordering problem in a principled way, we demonstrate more than 100-fold speedup of the search for complex motifs compared to previously published tools.


CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a new method for rna motif search that allows for a significant speedup of the search of complex motifs that include pseudoknots. such speed improvements are crucial at a time when the rate of dna sequencing outpaces growth in computing. rnarobo is available at http://compbio.fmph.uniba.sk/rnarobo.
