BACKGROUND
synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> is a cyanobacterium considered as a candidate photo-biological production platform - an attractive cell factory capable of using co <dig> and light as carbon and energy source, respectively. in order to enable efficient use of metabolic potential of synechocystis sp. pcc <dig>  it is of importance to develop tools for uncovering stoichiometric and regulatory principles in the synechocystis metabolic network.


RESULTS
we report the most comprehensive metabolic model of synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> available, isyn <dig>  which includes  <dig> reactions, associated with  <dig> genes, and  <dig> metabolites. the model includes a detailed biomass equation which encompasses elementary building blocks that are needed for cell growth, as well as a detailed stoichiometric representation of photosynthesis. we demonstrate applicability of isyn <dig> for stoichiometric analysis by simulating three physiologically relevant growth conditions of synechocystis sp. pcc <dig>  and through in silico metabolic engineering simulations that allowed identification of a set of gene knock-out candidates towards enhanced succinate production. gene essentiality and hydrogen production potential have also been assessed. furthermore, isyn <dig> was used as a transcriptomic data integration scaffold and thereby we found metabolic hot-spots around which gene regulation is dominant during light-shifting growth regimes.


CONCLUSIONS
isyn <dig> provides a platform for facilitating the development of cyanobacteria as microbial cell factories.
