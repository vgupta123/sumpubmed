BACKGROUND
targeted next generation sequencing  assays are cost-efficient and reliable alternatives to sanger sequencing. for sequencing of very large set of genes, the target enrichment approach is suitable. however, for smaller genomic regions, the target amplification method is more efficient than both the target enrichment method and sanger sequencing. the major difficulty of the target amplification method is the preparation of amplicons, regarding required time, equipment, and labor. multiplex pcr  is a good solution for the mentioned problems.


RESULTS
we propose a novel method to design mpcr primers for a continuous genomic region, following the best practices of clinically reliable pcr design processes. on an experimental setup with  <dig> different combinations of factors, we have shown that multiple parameters might effect finding the first feasible solution. increasing the length of the initial primer candidate selection sequence gives better results whereas waiting for a longer time to find the first feasible solution does not have a significant impact.


CONCLUSIONS
we generated mpcr primer designs for the hbb whole gene, mefv coding regions, and human exons between 2000 bp to 2100 bp-long. our benchmarking experiments show that the proposed mpcr approach is able produce reliable ngs assay primers for a given sequence in a reasonable amount of time.
