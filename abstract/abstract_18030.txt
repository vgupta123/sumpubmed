BACKGROUND
as the only truly flying mammals, bats use their unique wing - consisting of four elongated digits  connected by membranes - to power their flight. in addition to the elongated digits ii-v, the forelimb contains one shorter digit  that is morphologically similar to the hindlimb digits. here, we capitalized on the morphological variation among the bat forelimb digits to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying digit elongation and wing formation. using next generation sequencing technology, we performed digital gene expression tag profiling  of developing digits in a pooled sample of two myotis ricketti and validated our sequencing results using real-time quantitative pcr  of gene expression in the developing digits of two hipposideros armiger.


RESULTS
among hundreds of genes exhibiting significant differences in expression between the short and long digits, we highlight  <dig> genes most related to digit elongation. these genes include two tbx genes , five bmp pathway genes , four homeobox genes , and three other genes  related to digit malformations or cell proliferation. in addition, our results suggest that tbx <dig> and pitx <dig> contribute to the morphological similarity and five genes  contribute to the functional similarity between the thumb and hindlimb digits.


CONCLUSIONS
results of this study not only implicate many developmental genes as robust candidates underlying digit elongation and wing formation in bats, but also provide a better understanding of the genes involved in autopodial development in general.
