BACKGROUND
members of the mammalian nucleotide binding domain, leucine-rich repeat -containing receptor  family of proteins are key modulators of innate immunity regulating inflammation. our previous work has shown that among the members of this family, nlrp1/nalp <dig>  present in neurons, plays a crucial role in inflammasome formation and the production of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin  -1β and il- <dig> after various types of central nervous system injury.


RESULTS
we investigated whether age-related cognitive decline may involve a heightened inflammatory response associated with activation of the nlrp <dig> inflammasome in the hippocampus. young  and aged  male fischer  <dig> rats were tested in a spatial acquisition task via morris water maze. following behavioral testing, hippocampal lysates were assayed for expression of nlrp <dig> inflammasome components and inflammatory cytokines. hippocampal lysates from aged rats showed significantly higher levels of nlrp <dig> inflammasome constituents, caspase- <dig>  caspase- <dig>  the purinergic receptor p2x <dig>  pannexin- <dig> and x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis  than lysates from younger animals. following treatment with probenecid, an inhibitor or pannexin- <dig>  aged animals demonstrated reduction in inflammasome activation and improvement in spatial learning performance.


CONCLUSIONS
our behavioral findings are consistent with increases in il-1β and il- <dig> that have been previously shown to correlate with spatial learning deficits. probenecid reduced activated caspase- <dig> and ameliorated spatial learning deficits in aged rats. thus, aging processes stimulate activation of the nlrp <dig> inflammasome and secretion of il-1β and il- <dig> that may contribute to age-related cognitive decline in the growing elderly population. moreover, probenecid may be potentially useful as a therapy to improve cognitive outcomes in the aging population.
