BACKGROUND
the aim of this study was to investigate whether serotonin  can modulate na+/k+ pump in rat hippocampal ca <dig> pyramidal neurons.


RESULTS
5-ht  showed na+/k+ pump current  densities of  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa/pf contrast to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa/pf of the control of  <dig>  mm strophanthidin , demonstrating 5-ht-induced inhibition of ip in a dose-dependent manner in hippocampal ca <dig> pyramidal neurons. the effect was partly attenuated by ondasetron, a 5-ht <dig> receptor  antagonist, not by way <dig>  a 5-ht1ar antagonist, while 1- biguanide hydrochloride , a 5-ht3r specific agonist, mimicked the effect of 5-ht on ip.


CONCLUSIONS
5-ht inhibits neuronal na+/k+ pump activity via 5-ht3r in rat hippocampal ca <dig> pyramidal neurons. this discloses novel mechanisms for the function of 5-ht in learning and memory, which may be a useful target to benefit these patients with cognitive disorder.
