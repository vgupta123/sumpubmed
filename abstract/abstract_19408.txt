BACKGROUND
fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  a well-characterized heparin-binding growth factor, is involved in many biological processes like embryogenesis, cell proliferation and angiogenesis. however, this growth factor is very unstable and shows rapid degradation in aqueous solution. beside the well-known stabilization of fgf <dig> by heparin or heparan sulphate, the recently discovered binding to atp also shows a stabilizing and protective effect on this growth factor.


RESULTS
here we determined the dissociation constant of atp on fgf <dig> by equilibrium microdialysis  and analyzed the impact of this binding on secondary structure by cd-spectroscopy. atp-binding to fgf <dig> significantly changed the secondary structure of this growth factor with a shift to random coil structure elements. we also analyzed the influence of this binding on the stability of fgf <dig> in aqueous solution over a period of  <dig> h. while the amount of untreated fgf <dig> is reduced drastically over this period of time, atp-binding reduces the degradation considerably.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data suggest an important role of atp in fgf2-stabilization beside the well known-role of heparin and heparan sulphate.
