BACKGROUND
fidelity of dna polymerases can be influenced by cation co-factors. physiologically, mg2+ is used as a co-factor by hiv reverse transcriptase  to perform catalysis; however, alternative cations including mn2+, co2+, and zn2+ can also support catalysis. although zn2+ supports dna synthesis, it inhibits hiv rt by significantly modifying rt catalysis. zn2+ is currently being investigated as a component of novel treatment options against hiv and we wanted to investigate the fidelity of rt with zn2+.

methods
we used pcr-based and plasmid-based alpha complementation assays as well as steady-state misinsertion and misincorporation assays to examine the fidelity of rt with mn2+, co2+, and zn2+.


RESULTS
the fidelity of dna synthesis by hiv- <dig> rt was approximately  <dig>  fold greater in zn2+ when compared to mg2+ at cation conditions optimized for nucleotide catalysis. consistent with this, rt extended primers with mismatched 3′ nucleotides poorly and inserted incorrect nucleotides less efficiently using zn2+ than mg2+. in agreement with previous literature, we observed that mn2+ and co2+ dramatically decreased the fidelity of rt at highly elevated concentrations . however, surprisingly, the fidelity of hiv rt with mn2+ and co2+ remained similar to mg2+ at lower concentrations that are optimal for catalysis.


CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that zn2+, at optimal extension conditions, increases the fidelity of hiv- <dig> rt and challenges the notion that alternative cations capable of supporting polymerase catalysis are inherently mutagenic.
