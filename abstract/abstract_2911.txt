BACKGROUND
phylogenetic-based classification of m. tuberculosis and other bacterial genomes is a core analysis for studying evolutionary hypotheses, disease outbreaks and transmission events. whole genome sequencing is providing new insights into the genomic variation underlying intra- and inter-strain diversity, thereby assisting with the classification and molecular barcoding of the bacteria. one roadblock to strain investigation is the lack of user-interactive solutions to interrogate and visualise variation within a phylogenetic tree setting.


RESULTS
we have developed a web-based tool called phytb  to assist phylogenetic tree visualisation and identification of m. tuberculosis clade-informative polymorphism. variant call format files can be uploaded to determine a sample position within the tree. a map view summarises the geographical distribution of alleles and strain-types. the utility of the phytb is demonstrated on sequence data from  <dig>  m. tuberculosis isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
phytb contextualises m. tuberculosis genomic variation within epidemiological, geographical and phylogenic settings. further tool utility is possible by incorporating large variants and phenotypic data , and an assessment of genotype-phenotype associations. source code is available to develop similar websites for other organisms .
