BACKGROUND
in addition to the core catalytic machinery, bacterial replicative dna polymerases contain a polymerase and histidinol phosphatase  domain whose function is not entirely understood. the php domains of some bacterial replicases are active metal-dependent nucleases that may play a role in proofreading. in e. coli dna polymerase iii, however, the php domain has lost several metal-coordinating residues and is likely to be catalytically inactive.


RESULTS
genomic searches show that the loss of metal-coordinating residues in polymerase php domains is likely to have coevolved with the presence of a separate proofreading exonuclease that works with the polymerase. although the e. coli pol iii php domain has lost metal-coordinating residues, the structure of the domain has been conserved to a remarkable degree when compared to that of metal-binding php domains. this is demonstrated by our ability to restore metal binding with only three point mutations, as confirmed by the metal-bound crystal structure of this mutant determined at  <dig>  Ã… resolution. we also show that pol iii, a large multi-domain protein, unfolds cooperatively and that mutations in the degenerate metal-binding site of the php domain decrease the overall stability of pol iii and reduce its activity.


CONCLUSIONS
while the presence of a php domain in replicative bacterial polymerases is strictly conserved, its ability to coordinate metals and to perform proofreading exonuclease activity is not, suggesting additional non-enzymatic roles for the domain. our results show that the php domain is a major structural element in pol iii and its integrity modulates both the stability and activity of the polymerase.
