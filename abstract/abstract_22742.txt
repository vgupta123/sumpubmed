BACKGROUND
preeclampsia, one of the major disorders of pregnancy, is characterized by inadequate trophoblast invasion and defective trophoblast-mediated remodeling of placental vasculature. microrna-34a  has been found to be aberrantly expressed in the placentas of preeclamptic patients, yet its role in placental development and in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia remains elusive.


RESULTS
the levels of mir-34a in the placentas of  <dig> preeclamptic patients and  <dig> healthy subjects were determined by real time-pcr, and mir-34a was found significantly elevated in the preeclamptic placentas. further, the function of mir-34a in trophoblast cells was investigated by overexpressing mir-34a in jeg- <dig> trophoblast cell line. overexpression of mir-34a in jeg- <dig> cells inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion. in addition, elevated expression of mir-34a reduced the expression of both endogenous and ectopic myc. moreover, we identified that myc mrna was a direct target of mir-34a in jeg- <dig> cells by dual luciferase reporter assay, and found that downregulation of myc expression by mir-34a targeting significantly reduced the invasiveness of jeg- <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings provide preliminary evidence for the diverse functions of mir-34a in trophoblast biology, and suggest that mir-34a suppresses trophoblast invasion by directly targeting myc.
