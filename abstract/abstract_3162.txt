BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  is a major pathogen of swine worldwide. emergence in  <dig> of a novel highly pathogenic prrsv  isolate in china necessitated a comparative investigation into the host transcriptome response in tracheobronchial lymph nodes   <dig> days post-infection with hp-prrsv rjxwn <dig>  prrsv strain vr- <dig> or sham inocula. rna from each was prepared for next-generation sequencing. amplified library constructs were directly sequenced and a list of sequence transcripts and counts was generated using an rnaseq analysis pipeline to determine differential gene expression. transcripts were annotated and relative abundance was calculated based upon the number of times a given transcript was represented in the library.


RESULTS
major changes in transcript abundance occurred in response to infection with either prrsv strain, each with over  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts. the largest increase in transcript level for either virus versus sham-inoculated controls were three serum amyloid a <dig> acute-phase isoforms. however, the degree of up or down-regulation of transcripts following infection with hp-prrsv rjxwn <dig> was greater than transcript changes observed with us prrsv vr- <dig>  also, of  <dig> significantly altered transcripts within the hp-prrsv rjxwn <dig> library  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated more than 3-fold, whilst in the us prrsv vr- <dig> library only  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated more than 3-fold.


CONCLUSIONS
the magnitude of differentially expressed gene profiles detected in hp-prrsv rjxwn <dig> infected pigs as compared to vr- <dig> infected pigs was consistent with the increased pathogenicity of the hp-prrsv in vivo.
