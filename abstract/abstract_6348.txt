BACKGROUND
in piedmontese cattle the double-muscled phenotype is an inherited condition associated to a point mutation in the myostatin  gene. the piedmontese mstn missense mutation g938a is translated to c313y myostatin protein. this mutation alters mstn function as a negative regulator of muscle growth, thereby inducing muscle hypertrophy. mirnas could play a role in skeletal muscle hypertrophy modulation by down-regulating gene expression.


RESULTS
after identifying a 3′-utr consensus sequence of several negative and positive modulator genes involved in the skeletal muscle hypertrophy pathway, such as igf <dig>  igf1r, ppp3ca, nfatc <dig>  mef2c, gsk3b, tead <dig> and mstn, we screened mirnas matching to it. this analysis led to the identification of mir-27b, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-199b-5p as possible candidates. we collected samples of longissimus thoracis from twenty piedmontese and twenty friesian male bovines. in piedmontese group mir-27b was up-regulated  <dig> -fold . further, we report that the level of mstn mrna was about 5-fold lower in piedmontese cattle vs friesian cattle  and that less mature mstn protein was detected in the piedmontese one . cotransfection of mir-27b and psi-check <dig> vector with the luciferase reporter gene linked to the bovine wild-type 3′-utr of mstn strongly inhibited the luciferase activity .


CONCLUSIONS
these data demonstrate that bovine mstn is a specific target of mir-27b and that mirnas contribute to explain additive phenotypic hypertrophy in piedmontese cattle selected for the mstn gene mutation, possibly outlining a more precise genetic signature able to elucidate differences in muscle conformation.
