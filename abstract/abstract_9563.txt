BACKGROUND
metagenomics is a new field of research on natural microbial communities. high-throughput sequencing techniques like  <dig> or solexa-illumina promise new possibilities as they are able to produce huge amounts of data in much shorter time and with less efforts and costs than the traditional sanger technique. but the data produced comes in even shorter reads . carma is a new software pipeline for the characterisation of species composition and the genetic potential of microbial samples using short, unassembled reads.


RESULTS
in this paper, we introduce webcarma, a refined version of carma available as a web application for the taxonomic and functional classification of unassembled short reads from metagenomic communities. in addition, we have analysed the applicability of ultra-short reads in metagenomics.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that unassembled reads as short as  <dig> bp can be used for the taxonomic classification of a metagenome. the web application is freely available at http://webcarma.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de.
