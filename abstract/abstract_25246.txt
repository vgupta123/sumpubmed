BACKGROUND
predicting the function of a protein from its sequence is a long-standing challenge of bioinformatic research, typically addressed using either sequence-similarity or sequence-motifs. we employ the novel motif method that consists of specific peptides  that are unique to specific branches of the enzyme commission  functional classification. we devise the data mining of enzymes  methodology that allows for searching sps on arbitrary proteins, determining from its sequence whether a protein is an enzyme and what the enzyme's ec classification is.


RESULTS
we extract novel sp sets from swiss-prot enzyme data. using a training set of july  <dig>  and test sets of july  <dig>  we find that the predictive power of sps, both for true-positives  and true-negatives , depends on the coverage length of all sp matches . dme is quite different from blast. comparing the two on an enzyme test set of july  <dig>  we find that dme has lower recall. on the other hand, dme can provide predictions for proteins regarded by blast as having low homologies with known enzymes, thus supplying complementary information. we test our method on a set of proteins belonging to  <dig> bacteria, dated july  <dig>  establishing the usefulness of the coverage-length cutoff to determine true-negatives. moreover, sifting through our predictions we find that some of them have been substantiated by swiss-prot annotations by july  <dig>  finally we extract, for production purposes, a novel sp set trained on all swiss-prot enzymes as of july  <dig>  this new set increases considerably the recall of dme. the new sp set is being applied to three metagenomes: sargasso sea with over  <dig> , <dig> proteins, producing predictions of over  <dig>  enzymes, and two human gut metagenomes. the outcome of these analyses can be characterized by the enzymatic profile of the metagenomes, describing the relative numbers of enzymes observed for different ec categories.


CONCLUSIONS
employing sps for predicting enzymatic activity of proteins works well once one utilizes coverage-length criteria. in our analysis, l â‰¥  <dig> has led to highly accurate results.
