BACKGROUND
genome-scale models of metabolism and macromolecular expression  significantly expand the scope and predictive capabilities of constraint-based modeling. me models present considerable computational challenges: they are much  larger than corresponding metabolic reconstructions , are multiscale, and growth maximization is a nonlinear programming  problem, mainly due to macromolecule dilution constraints.


RESULTS
here, we address these computational challenges. we develop a fast and numerically reliable solution method for growth maximization in me models using a quad-precision nlp solver . our method was up to  <dig> % faster than binary search for six significant digits in growth rate. we also develop a fast, quad-precision flux variability analysis that is accelerated  via solver warm-starts. finally, we employ the tools developed to investigate growth-coupled succinate overproduction, accounting for proteome constraints.


CONCLUSIONS
just as genome-scale metabolic reconstructions have become an invaluable tool for computational and systems biologists, we anticipate that these fast and numerically reliable me solution methods will accelerate the wide-spread adoption of me models for researchers in these fields.
