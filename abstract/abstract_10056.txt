BACKGROUND
manually annotated corpora are critical for the training and evaluation of automated methods to identify concepts in biomedical text.


RESULTS
this paper presents the concept annotations of the colorado richly annotated full-text  corpus, a collection of  <dig> full-length, open-access biomedical journal articles that have been annotated both semantically and syntactically to serve as a research resource for the biomedical natural-language-processing  community. craft identifies all mentions of nearly all concepts from nine prominent biomedical ontologies and terminologies: the cell type ontology, the chemical entities of biological interest ontology, the ncbi taxonomy, the protein ontology, the sequence ontology, the entries of the entrez gene database, and the three subontologies of the gene ontology. the first public release includes the annotations for  <dig> of the  <dig> articles, reserving two sets of  <dig> articles for future text-mining competitions . concept annotations were created based on a single set of guidelines, which has enabled us to achieve consistently high interannotator agreement.


CONCLUSIONS
as the initial 67-article release contains more than  <dig>  tokens , our corpus is among the largest gold-standard annotated biomedical corpora. unlike most others, the journal articles that comprise the corpus are drawn from diverse biomedical disciplines and are marked up in their entirety. additionally, with a concept-annotation count of nearly  <dig>  in the 67-article subset , the scale of conceptual markup is also among the largest of comparable corpora. the concept annotations of the craft corpus have the potential to significantly advance biomedical text mining by providing a high-quality gold standard for nlp systems. the corpus, annotation guidelines, and other associated resources are freely available at http://bionlp-corpora.sourceforge.net/craft/index.shtml.
