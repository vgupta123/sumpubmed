BACKGROUND
since yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and its components are being used for the prevention and treatment of enteric diseases in different species, they may also be useful for preventing johne’s disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of ruminants caused by mycobacterium avium spp. paratuberculosis . this study aimed to identify potential yeast derivatives that may be used to help prevent map infection. the adherence of mcherry-labeled map to bovine mammary epithelial cell line  and bovine primary epithelial cells  co-cultured with yeast cell wall components  from four different yeast strains  and two forms of dead yeast from strain a was investigated.


RESULTS
the cwcs from all four yeast strains and the other two forms of dead yeast from strain a reduced map adhesion to mac-t cells and becs in a concentration-dependent manner after 6-h of exposure, with the dead yeast having the greatest effect.


CONCLUSIONS
the following in vitro binding studies suggest that dead yeast and its’ cwcs may be useful for reducing risk of map infection.
