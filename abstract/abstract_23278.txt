BACKGROUND
association analysis is an alternative to conventional family-based methods to detect the location of gene or quantitative trait loci  and provides relatively high resolution in terms of defining the genome position of a gene or qtl. seed protein and oil concentration are quantitative traits which are determined by the interaction among many genes with small to moderate genetic effects and their interaction with the environment. in this study, a genome-wide association study  was performed to identify quantitative trait loci  controlling seed protein and oil concentration in  <dig> soybean germplasm accessions exhibiting a wide range of seed protein and oil content.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  were genotyped using various methods including illumina infinium and goldengate assays and  <dig>  markers with minor allele frequency > <dig>  were used to estimate linkage disequilibrium  in heterochromatic and euchromatic regions. in euchromatic regions, the mean ld  rapidly declined to  <dig>  within  <dig> kbp, whereas the mean ld declined to  <dig>  at  <dig>  kbp in heterochromatic regions. the gwas results identified  <dig> snps in  <dig> different genomic regions significantly associated with seed protein. of these, the five snps with the highest associations and seven adjacent snps were located in the  <dig> - <dig>  mbp region of gm <dig>  a major seed protein qtl has been previously mapped to the same location and potential candidate genes have recently been identified in this region. the gwas results also detected  <dig> snps in  <dig> different genomic regions associated with seed oil. of these markers, seven snps had a significant association with both protein and oil.


CONCLUSIONS
this research indicated that gwas not only identified most of the previously reported qtl controlling seed protein and oil, but also resulted in narrower genomic regions than the regions reported as containing these qtl. the narrower gwas-defined genome regions will allow more precise marker-assisted allele selection and will expedite positional cloning of the causal gene.
