BACKGROUND
improved understanding of bacterial-fungal interactions in the rhizosphere should assist in the successful application of bacteria as biological control agents against fungal pathogens of plants, providing alternatives to chemicals in sustainable agriculture. rhizoctonia solani is an important soil-associated fungal pathogen and its chemical treatment is not feasible or economic. the genomes of the plant-associated bacteria serratia proteamaculans s <dig> and serratia plymuthica as <dig> have been sequenced, revealing genetic traits that may explain their diverse plant growth promoting activities and antagonistic interactions with r. solani. to understand the functional response of this pathogen to different bacteria and to elucidate whether the molecular mechanisms that the fungus exploits involve general stress or more specific responses, we performed a global transcriptome profiling of r. solani rhs1ap anastomosis group  <dig>  during interaction with the s <dig> and as <dig> species of serratia using rna-seq.


RESULTS
approximately  <dig>  million clean 75-100 bp paired-end reads were obtained from three libraries, each in triplicate . transcriptome analysis revealed that approximately 10 % of the fungal transcriptome was differentially expressed during challenge with serratia. the numbers of s4- and as13-specific differentially expressed genes  were  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, while there were  <dig> common degs in the two treatment groups. four hundred and sixty and  <dig> genes respectively had values of log <dig> fold-change >  <dig> and for further analyses this cut-off value was used. functional classification of degs based on gene ontology enrichment analysis and on kegg pathway annotations revealed a general shift in fungal gene expression in which genes related to xenobiotic degradation, toxin and antioxidant production, energy, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and hyphal rearrangements were subjected to transcriptional regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
this rna-seq profiling generated a novel dataset describing the functional response of the phytopathogen r. solani ag <dig> to the plant-associated serratia bacteria s <dig> and as <dig>  most genes were regulated in the same way in the presence of both bacterial isolates, but there were also some strain-specific responses. the findings in this study will be beneficial for further research on biological control and in depth exploration of bacterial-fungal interactions in the rhizosphere.
