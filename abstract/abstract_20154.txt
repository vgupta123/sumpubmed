BACKGROUND
poor reproductive maturation in captive male broodstock of the black tiger shrimp  is one of the serious problems to the farming industries. without genome sequence, est libraries of p. monodon were previously constructed to identify transcripts with important biological functions. in this study, a new version of cdna microarray, unishrimpchip, was constructed from the peneaus monodon est libraries of  <dig> tissues, containing  <dig>  non-redundant cdna clones from  <dig>  unique cdna in the p. monodon est database. unishrimpchip was used to study testicular development by comparing gene expression levels of wild brooders from the west and east coasts of thailand and domesticated brooders with different ages .


RESULTS
the overall gene expression patterns from the microarray experiments revealed distinct transcriptomic patterns between the wild and domesticated groups. moreover, differentially expressed genes from the microarray comparisons were identified, and the expression patterns of eight selected transcripts were subsequently confirmed by reverse-transcriptase quantitative pcr . among these, expression levels of six subunits  of the cop <dig> signalosome  gene family in wild and different ages of domesticated brooders were examined by rt-qpcr. among the six subunits, csn <dig> and csn <dig> were most highly expressed in wild brooders and least expressed in the 18-month-old domesticated group; therefore, their full-length cdna sequences were characterized.


CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first report to employ cdna microarray to study testicular development in the black tiger shrimp. we show that there are obvious differences between the wild and domesticated shrimp at the transcriptomic level. furthermore, our study is the first to investigate the feasibility that the csn gene family might have involved in reproduction and development of this economically important species.
