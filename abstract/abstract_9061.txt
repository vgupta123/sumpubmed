BACKGROUND
premature aging syndromes recapitulate many aspects of natural aging and provide an insight into this phenomenon at a molecular and cellular level. the progeria syndromes appear to cause rapid aging through disruption of normal nuclear structure. recently, a coding mutation  in the barrier to autointegration factor  <dig>  gene was identified as the genetic basis of néstor-guillermo progeria syndrome . this mutation was described to cause instability in the banf <dig> protein, causing a disruption of the nuclear envelope structure.


RESULTS
here we demonstrate that the banf <dig> a12t protein is indeed correctly folded, stable and that the observed phenotype, is likely due to the disruption of the dna binding surface of the a12t mutant. we demonstrate, using biochemical assays, that the banf <dig> a12t protein is impaired in its ability to bind dna while its interaction with nuclear envelope proteins is unperturbed. consistent with this, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of the mutant protein induces the ngps cellular phenotype, while the protein localizes normally to the nuclear envelope.


CONCLUSIONS
our study clarifies the role of the a12t mutation in ngps patients, which will be of importance for understanding the development of the disease.
