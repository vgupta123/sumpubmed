BACKGROUND
the annotations of affymetrix dna microarray probe sets with gene ontology terms are carefully selected for correctness. this results in very accurate but incomplete annotations which is not always desirable for microarray experiment evaluation.


RESULTS
here we present a protocol to amplify the set of gene ontology annotations associated to affymetrix dna microarray probe sets using information from related databases.


CONCLUSIONS
predicted novel annotations and the evidence producing them can be accessed at probe2go: . scripts are available on demand.
