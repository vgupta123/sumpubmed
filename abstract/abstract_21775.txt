BACKGROUND
motion analysis is one of the tools available to biologists to extract biologically relevant information from image datasets and has been applied to a diverse range of organisms. the application of motion analysis during early development presents a challenge, as embryos often exhibit complex, subtle and diverse movement patterns. a method of motion analysis able to holistically quantify complex embryonic movements could be a powerful tool for fields such as toxicology and developmental biology to investigate whole organism stress responses. here we assessed whether motion analysis could be used to distinguish the effects of stressors on three early developmental stages of each of three species:  the zebrafish danio rerio ;  the african clawed toad xenopus laevis ; and iii) the pond snail radix balthica . image sequences were analysed using sparse optic flow and the resultant frame-to-frame motion parameters were analysed using discrete fourier transform to quantify the distribution of energy at different frequencies. this spectral frequency dataset was then used to construct a bray-curtis similarity matrix and differences in movement patterns between embryos in this matrix were tested for using anosim.


RESULTS
spectral frequency analysis of these motion parameters was able to distinguish stage-specific effects of environmental stressors in most cases, including xenopus laevis at stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> exposed to a salinity of  <dig>  danio rerio at 33 hpf exposed to  <dig> % ethanol, and radix balthica at stages e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> exposed to salinities of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  this technique was better able to distinguish embryos exposed to stressors than analysis of manual quantification of movement and within species distinguished most of the developmental stages studied in the control treatments.


CONCLUSIONS
this innovative use of motion analysis incorporates data quantifying embryonic movements at a range of frequencies and so provides an holistic analysis of an embryo’s movement patterns. this technique has potential applications for quantifying embryonic responses to environmental stressors such as exposure to pharmaceuticals or pollutants, and also as an automated tool for developmental staging of embryos.
