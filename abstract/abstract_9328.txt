BACKGROUND
medicago truncatula, a close relative of alfalfa, is a preeminent model for studying nitrogen fixation, symbiosis, and legume genomics. the medicago sequencing project began in  <dig> with the goal to decipher sequences originated from the euchromatic portion of the genome. the initial sequencing approach was based on a bac tiling path, culminating in a bac-based assembly  as well as an in-depth analysis of the genome published in  <dig> 


RESULTS
here we describe a further improved and refined version of the m. truncatula genome  based on de novo whole genome shotgun assembly of a majority of illumina and  <dig> reads using allpaths-lg. the allpaths-lg scaffolds were anchored onto the pseudomolecules on the basis of alignments to both the optical map and the genotyping-by-sequencing  map. the mt <dig>  pseudomolecules encompass ~360 mb of actual sequences spanning 390 mb of which ~330 mb align perfectly with the optical map, presenting a drastic improvement over the bac-based mt <dig>  which only contained 70% sequences  of the current version. most of the sequences and genes that previously resided on the unanchored portion of mt <dig>  have now been incorporated into the mt <dig>  pseudomolecules, with the exception of ~28 mb of unplaced sequences. with regard to gene annotation, the genome has been re-annotated through our gene prediction pipeline, which integrates est, rna-seq, protein and gene prediction evidences. a total of  <dig>  genes  are included in mt <dig>  which overlapped with ~82% of the gene loci annotated in mt <dig> . of the remaining genes, 14% of the mt <dig>  genes have been deprecated to an “unsupported” status and 4% are absent from the mt <dig>  predictions.


CONCLUSIONS
mt <dig>  and its associated resources, such as genome browsers, blast-able datasets and gene information pages, can be found on the jcvi medicago web site . the assembly and annotation has been deposited in genbank . the heavily curated chromosomal sequences and associated gene models of medicago will serve as a better reference for legume biology and comparative genomics.
