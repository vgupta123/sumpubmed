BACKGROUND
chromatin plays a critical role in regulating transcription factors  binding to their canonical transcription factor binding sites . recent studies in vertebrates show that many tfs preferentially bind to genomic regions that are well bound by nucleosomes in vitro. co-occurring secondary motifs sometimes correlated with functional tfbs.


RESULTS
we used a logistic regression to evaluate how well the propensity for nucleosome binding and co-occurrence of a secondary motif identify which canonical motifs are bound in vivo. we used chip-seq data for three transcription factors binding to their canonical motifs: c-jun binding the ap- <dig> motif , gr  binding the gr motif , and hoxa <dig>  binding the pbx  motif . for all canonical tfbs in the mouse genome, we calculated intrinsic nucleosome occupancy scores  for its surrounding 150-bps dna and examined the relationship with in vivo tf binding. in mouse mammary  <dig> cells, c-jun and gr proteins preferentially bound regions calculated to be well-bound by nucleosomes in vitro with the canonical ap- <dig> and gr motifs themselves contributing to the high inos. functional gr motifs are enriched for ap- <dig> motifs if they are within a nucleosome-sized 150-bps region. gr and hoxa <dig> also bind motifs with low inos, perhaps indicating a different mechanism of action.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis quantified the contribution of inos and co-occurring sequence to the identification of functional canonical motifs in the genome. this analysis revealed an inherent competition between some tfs and nucleosomes for binding canonical tfbs. gr and c-jun cooperate if they are within 150-bps. binding of hoxa <dig> and a fraction of gr to motifs with low inos values suggesting they are not in competition with nucleosomes and may function using different mechanisms.
