BACKGROUND
cd4+ t helper type  <dig>  cells, their cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> and the transcription factor stat <dig> are known to regulate various features of asthma including lung inflammation, mucus production and airway hyperreactivity and also drive alternative activation of macrophages . however, the precise roles played by the il-4/il- <dig> receptors and stat <dig> in inducing aam protein expression and modulating specific features of airway inflammation are still unclear. since th <dig> differentiation and activation plays a pivotal role in this disease, we explored the possibility of developing an asthma model in mice using t cells that were differentiated in vivo.


RESULTS
in this study, we monitored the activation and proliferation status of adoptively transferred allergen-specific naïve or in vivo primed cd4+ t cells. we found that both the naïve and in vivo primed t cells expressed similar levels of cd <dig> and il- <dig>  however, in vivo primed t cells underwent reduced proliferation in a lymphopenic environment when compared to naïve t cells. we then used these in vivo generated effector t cells in an asthma model. although there was reduced inflammation in mice lacking il-4rα or stat <dig>  significant amounts of eosinophils were still present in the bal and lung tissue. moreover, specific aam proteins ym <dig> and fizz <dig> were expressed by epithelial cells, while macrophages expressed only ym <dig> in rag2-/- mice. we further show that fizz <dig> and ym <dig> protein expression in the lung was completely dependent on signaling through the il-4rα and stat <dig>  consistent with the enhanced inflammation and aam protein expression, there was a significant increase in collagen deposition and smooth muscle thickening in rag2-/- mice compared to mice deficient in il-4rα or stat <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these results establish that transfer of in vivo primed cd4+ t cells can induce allergic lung inflammation. furthermore, while il-4/il- <dig> signaling through il-4rα and stat <dig> is essential for aam protein expression, lung inflammation and eosinophilia are only partially dependent on this pathway. further studies are required to identify other proteins and signaling pathways involved in airway inflammation.
