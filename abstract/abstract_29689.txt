BACKGROUND
cellulose is an integral component of the plant cell wall and accounts for approximately forty percent of total plant biomass but understanding its mechanism of synthesis remains elusive. cellulose synthase a  proteins function as catalytic subunits of a rosette-shaped complex that synthesizes cellulose at the plasma membrane. arabidopsis thaliana and rice  secondary wall cesa loss-of-function mutants have weak stems and irregular or thin cell walls.


RESULTS
here, we identify candidates for secondary wall cesas in brachypodium distachyon as having similar amino acid sequence and expression to those characterized in a. thaliana, namely cesa4/7/ <dig>  to functionally characterize bdcesa <dig> and bdcesa <dig>  we generated loss-of-function mutants using artificial microrna constructs, specifically targeting each gene driven by a maize  ubiquitin promoter. presence of the transgenes reduced bdcesa <dig> and bdcesa <dig> transcript abundance, as well as stem area, cell wall thickness of xylem and fibers, and the amount of crystalline cellulose in the cell wall.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest bdcesa <dig> and bdcesa <dig> play a key role in b. distachyon secondary cell wall biosynthesis.
