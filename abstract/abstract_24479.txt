BACKGROUND
a multiplex qpcr targeting a 128 bp region on the 23s rdna gene was developed for detection of brachyspira  hyodysenteriae and b. pilosicoli, the agents of swine dysentery  and porcine intestinal spirochaetosis , together with a triplet of apathogenic brachyspira spp.  in porcine feces. the multiplex qpcr was evaluated against a duplex pcr .


RESULTS
using dna extracted from fecal culture, the multiplex qpcr showed excellent agreement with the duplex pcr . in addition, thanks to the three probes whereof one detecting the apathogenic brachyspria spp., a more diversified overview of the brachyspiral flora in porcine fecal samples can be delivered as a part of the routine diagnostic. the multiplex qpcr with a limit of detection of 5– <dig> genomic equivalents  per reaction  allows reliable detection of brachyspira species directly from fecal swab dna. in line with this, analysis of  <dig> fecal swabs in comparison with culture-based qpcr showed a high agreement for the causative agents of sd .


CONCLUSIONS
the novel multiplex qpcr is robust and has a high analytical sensitivity and is therefore suitable for high-throughput screening of porcine fecal swabs for the causative agents of sd. this assay can therefore be used for the direct proof of the pathogenic b. spp. in fecal swabs within the scope of a monitoring program.
