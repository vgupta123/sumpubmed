BACKGROUND
micrornas  are endogenous small  single-stranded non-coding rnas that typically function by guiding cleavage of target genes. to find the mirnas that may be involved in dark-induced leaf senescence, we identified mirnas by microarray platform using arabidopsis thaliana leaves from both whole darkened plants  and individually darkened leaves .


RESULTS
we found that the expressions of  <dig> mirnas  were significantly changed both in dp and idl leaves. among them, the expression levels of  <dig> mirnas were relative higher than others . of these differentially expressed mirnas,  <dig> mirnas  have been previously reported to be involved in dark-induced leaf senescence, and the remaining  <dig> mirnas have not been implicated in leaf senescence before. target genes of all  <dig> mirnas were predicted, and some of them, such as nac <dig>  at3g <dig>  at2g <dig> and at2g <dig>  were found in the leaf senescence database . go and kegg analysis of  <dig> mirnas showed that the predicted target genes were significantly enriched in transcription regulation, development-related biological processes and metabolic pathways. expression levels of some of the corresponding mirna targets  were analysed and found to be significantly different in dp/idl than that in wt.


CONCLUSIONS
a microarray analysis about dark-induced mirnas involved in leaf senescence are present here. further expression analysis revealed that some new founding mirnas maybe regulate leaf senescence in arabidopsis, and the findings highlight the important role of mirnas in dark-induced leaf senescence.
