BACKGROUND
vaginal lactic acid bacteria defend the host against pathogens through a combination of competitive exclusion, competition for nutrients, production of antimicrobial substances and through the activation of the immune system. a new human isolate named lactobacillus crispatus l <dig> was characterized in this work, and a preliminary evaluation of its probiotic potential is described together with a process to obtain a high productivity of viable biomass.


RESULTS
in a simulated digestion process  <dig> ⋅ <dig> cells∙ml− <dig> survived the gastric environment with 80% viability, without being affected by small intestine juices. experiments on six different c sources were performed to analyze growth and organic acids production and, glucose, provided the best performances. a microfiltration strategy was exploited to improve the cellular yield in 2 l-fermentation processes, reaching 27 g · l− <dig> of dry biomass. moreover, l. crispatus l <dig> demonstrated a greater stability to high concentrations of lactic acid, compared to other lactobacilli. the specific l. crispatus l <dig> exopolysaccharide was purified from the fermentation broth and characterized by nmr showing structural features and similarity to exopolysaccharides produced by pathogenic strains. live l. crispatus l <dig> cells strongly reduced adhesion of a yeast pathogenic strain, candida albicans in particular, in adherence assays. interestingly a higher expression of the human defensin hbd- <dig> was also observed in vaginal cells treated with the purified exopolysaccharide, indicating a possible correlation with c. albicans growth inhibition.


CONCLUSIONS
the paper describes the evaluation of l. crispatus l <dig> as potential vaginal probiotic and the fermentation processes to obtain high concentrations of viable cells.
