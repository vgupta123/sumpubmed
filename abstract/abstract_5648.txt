BACKGROUND
mono-adp-ribosyltransferase   <dig> belongs to a family of mammalian ectoenzymes that catalyze the transfer of adp-ribose from nad+ to a target protein. art <dig> is predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. it adp-ribosylates α7-integrin which together with β1-integrin forms a dimer and binds to laminin, a protein of the extracellular matrix involved in cell adhesion. this posttranslational modification leads to an increased laminin binding affinity.


RESULTS
using c2c <dig> and c3h-10t 1/ <dig> cells as models of myogenesis, we found that art <dig> expression was restricted to myotube formation. we identified a fragment spanning the gene  <dig>  kb upstream of the transcriptional start site as the functional promoter of the art <dig> gene. this region contains an e box and an a/t-rich element, two conserved binding sites for transcription factors found in the promoters of most skeletal muscle specific genes. mutating the dna consensus sequence of either the e box or the a/t-rich element resulted in a nearly complete loss of art <dig> promoter inducibility, indicating a cooperative role of the transcription factors binding to those sites. gel mobility shift analyses carried out with nuclear extracts from c2c <dig> and c3h-10t 1/ <dig> cells revealed binding of myogenin to the e box and mef- <dig> to the a/t-rich element, the binding being restricted to c2c <dig> and c3h-10t 1/ <dig> myotubes.


CONCLUSIONS
here we describe the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of the art <dig> gene expression in skeletal muscle cells. the differentiation-dependent upregulation of art <dig> mrna is induced by the binding of myogenin to an e box and of mef- <dig> to an a/t-rich element in the proximal promoter region of the art <dig> gene. thus the transcriptional regulation involves molecular mechanisms similar to those used to activate muscle-specific genes.
