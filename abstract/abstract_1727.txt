BACKGROUND
the change from juvenile to mature phase in woody plants is often accompanied by a gradual loss of rooting ability, as well as by reduced microrna   <dig> and increased mir <dig> expression.


RESULTS
we characterized the population of mirnas of eucalyptus grandis and compared the gradual reduction in mir <dig> and increase in mir <dig> expression during development to the loss of rooting ability. forty known and eight novel mirnas were discovered and their predicted targets are listed. the expression pattern of nine mirnas was determined during adventitious root formation in juvenile and mature cuttings. while the expression levels of mir <dig> and mir <dig> were inverse in juvenile and mature tissues, no mutual relationship was found between high mir <dig> expression and rooting ability, or high mir <dig> expression and loss of rooting ability. this is shown both in e. grandis and in e. brachyphylla, in which explants that underwent rejuvenation in tissue culture conditions were also examined.


CONCLUSIONS
it is suggested that in these eucalyptus species, there is no correlation between the switch of mir <dig> with mir <dig> expression in the stems and the loss of rooting ability.
