BACKGROUND
protein-protein interaction  databases have become a major resource for investigating biological networks and pathways in cells. a number of publicly available repositories for human ppis are currently available. each of these databases has their own unique features with a large variation in the type and depth of their annotations.


RESULTS
we analyzed the major publicly available primary databases that contain literature curated ppi information for human proteins. this included bind, dip, hprd, intact, mint, mips, pdzbase and reactome databases. the number of binary non-redundant human ppis ranged from  <dig> in pdzbase and  <dig> in mips to  <dig>  in mint and  <dig>  in hprd. the number of genes annotated with at least one interactor was  <dig>  in hprd,  <dig>  in mint,  <dig>  in intact,  <dig>  in bind and < <dig>  in the remaining databases. the number of literature citations for the ppis included in the databases was  <dig>  in hprd,  <dig>  in mint,  <dig>  in intact,  <dig>  in bind and < <dig>  in the remaining databases.


CONCLUSIONS
given the importance of ppis, we suggest that submission of ppis to repositories be made mandatory by scientific journals at the time of manuscript submission as this will minimize annotation errors, promote standardization and help keep the information up to date. we hope that our analysis will help guide biomedical scientists in selecting the most appropriate database for their needs especially in light of the dramatic differences in their content.
