BACKGROUND
the basal forebrain  cholinergic neurons play an important role in cortical activation and arousal and are active in association with cortical activation of waking and inactive in association with cortical slow wave activity of sleep. in view of findings that gabaa receptors  and inhibitory transmission undergo dynamic changes as a function of prior activity, we investigated whether the gabaars on cholinergic cells might undergo such changes as a function of their prior activity during waking vs. sleep.


RESULTS
in the brains of rats under sleep control , sleep deprivation  or sleep recovery  conditions in the  <dig> hours prior to sacrifice, we examined immunofluorescent staining for β2– <dig> subunit gabaars on choline acetyltransferase  immunopositive  cells in the magnocellular bf. in sections also stained for c-fos, β2– <dig> gabaars were present on chat+ neurons which expressed c-fos in the sd group alone and were variable or undetectable on other chat+ cells across groups. in dual-immunostained sections, the luminance of β2– <dig> gabaars over the membrane of chat+ cells was found to vary significantly across conditions and to be significantly higher in sd than sc or sr groups.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that membrane gabaars increase on cholinergic cells as a result of activity during sustained waking and reciprocally decrease as a result of inactivity during sleep. these changes in membrane gabaars would be associated with increased gaba-mediated inhibition of cholinergic cells following prolonged waking and diminished inhibition following sleep and could thus reflect a homeostatic process regulating cholinergic cell activity and thereby indirectly cortical activity across the sleep-waking cycle.
