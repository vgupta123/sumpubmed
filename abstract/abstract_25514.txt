BACKGROUND
photodynamic therapy  is an effective local cancer treatment that involves light activation of a photosensitizer, resulting in oxygen-dependent, free radical-mediated cell death. little is known about the comparative efficacy of pdt in treating non-small cell lung carcinoma  and small cell lung carcinoma , despite ongoing clinical trials treating lung cancers. the present study evaluated the potential use of chlorin e <dig> â€“ polyvinylpyrrolidone  as a multimodality photosensitizer for fluorescence detection and photodynamic therapy  on nsclc and sclc xenografts.


RESULTS
human nsclc  and sclc  tumor cell lines were used to establish tumor xenografts in the chick chorioallantoic membrane  model as well as in the balb/c nude mice. in the cam model, ce6-pvp was applied topically  and fluorescence intensity was charted at various time points. tumor-bearing mice were given intravenous administration of ce6-pvp  and laser irradiation at  <dig> nm . tumor response was evaluated at  <dig> h post pdt. studies of temporal fluorescence pharmacokinetics in cam tumor xenografts showed that ce6-pvp has a selective localization and a good accuracy in demarcating nsclc compared to sclc from normal surrounding cam after  <dig> h post drug administration. irradiation at  <dig> h drug-light interval showed greater tumor necrosis against human nsclc xenografts in nude mice. sclc xenografts were observed to express resistance to photosensitization with ce6-pvp.


CONCLUSIONS
the formulation of ce6-pvp is distinctly advantageous as a diagnostic and therapeutic agent for fluorescence diagnosis and pdt of nsclc.
