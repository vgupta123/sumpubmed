BACKGROUND
anthropogenic habitat modifications have led to the extinction of many species and have favoured the expansion of others. nonetheless, the possible role of humans as a diversifying force in vertebrate evolution has rarely been considered, especially for species with long generation times. we examine the influence that humans have had on the colonization and phenotypic and genetic differentiation of an insular population of a long-lived raptor species, the egyptian vulture .


RESULTS
the morphological comparison between the canarian egyptian vultures and the main and closest population in western europe  indicated that insular vultures are significantly heavier  and larger  than those from iberia. bayesian and standard genetic analyses also showed differentiation . the inference of changes in the effective size of the canarian deme, using two likelihood-based bayesian approaches, suggested that the establishment of this insular population took place some  <dig> years ago, matching the date of human colonization. this is consistent with the lack of earlier fossils.


CONCLUSIONS
archaeological remains show that first colonizers were berber people from northern africa who imported goats. this new and abundant food source could have allowed vultures to colonize, expand and adapt to the island environment. our results suggest that anthropogenic environmental change can induce diversification and that this process may take place on an ecological time scale , even in the case of a long-lived species.
