BACKGROUND
protein misfolding cyclic amplification  is a method that facilitates the detection of prions from many sources of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy . sheep scrapie represents a unique diversity of prion disease agents in a range of susceptible prnp genotypes. in this study pmca was assessed on a range of great britain  sheep scrapie isolates to determine the applicability to veterinary diagnosis of ovine tse.


RESULTS
prpsc amplification by protein misfolding cyclic amplification  was assessed as a diagnostic tool for field cases of scrapie. the technique was initially applied to thirty-seven isolates of scrapie from diverse geographical locations around gb, and involved sheep of various breeds and prnp genotypes. all samples were amplified in either vrq and/or arq prpc substrate. for prpsc from sheep with at least one vrq allele, all samples amplified efficiently in vrq prpc but only prpsc from arh/vrq sheep amplified in both substrates. prpsc from arq/arq sheep displayed two amplification patterns, one that amplified in both substrates and one that only amplified in arq prpc. these amplification patterns were consistent for a further 14/ <dig> flock/farm mates of these sheep. furthermore experimental scrapie strains ssbp <dig>  dawson, ch <dig> and mri were analysed. ssbp <dig> and dawson  amplified in vrq but not arq substrate. mri scrapie  nor ch <dig> did not amplify in arq or vrq substrate; these strains required an enhanced pmca method incorporating polyadenylic acid ) to achieve amplification.


CONCLUSIONS
prpsc from  <dig> classical scrapie gb field isolates amplified in vrq or arq or both substrates and supports the use of pmca as a rapid assay for the detection of a wide range of ovine classical scrapie infections involving multiple prnp genotypes and scrapie strains.
