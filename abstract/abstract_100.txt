BACKGROUND
human mast cell  maturation occurs in tissues interfacing with the external environment, exposing both mast cell progenitors and mature mast cells, to bacteria and their products. it is unknown, however, whether long- or short-term exposure to bacteria-derived toll-like receptor  ligands, such as lipopolysaccharide  or peptidoglycan , influences humc biology.


RESULTS
over  <dig> wks of culture, lps had minimal effect on humc numbers but increased cd <dig>  tryptase and chymase expression. pgn inhibited humc development. for mature mast cells, lps in the presence of rhscf  increased cd <dig>  tryptase, chymase and carboxypeptidase expression, primarily in cd117low humc. lps decreased fcεri expression and β-hexosaminidase release; but had no effect on ltc <dig> and pgd <dig> production. pgn reduced humc numbers; and cd <dig> and tryptase expression. il-1β and il- <dig>  were detected in short-term culture supernatants of lps treated cells, and reproduced the increases in cd <dig>  tryptase, chymase, and carboxypeptidase expression observed in the presence of lps. comparative studies with mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells from wild type, but not tlr <dig> knockout mice, showed increases in mrna of mouse mast cell chymases mmcp- <dig>  mmcp- <dig> and mmcp- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
pgn inhibits humc growth, while lps exerts its primary effects on mature humc by altering cytokine production and protease composition, particularly at low concentrations of scf. these data demonstrate the ability of bacterial products to alter humc mediator production, granular content, and number which may be particularly relevant at mucosal sites where humc are exposed to these products.
