BACKGROUND
we developed an efficient in vitro method to differentiate mouse es cells into the definitive endoderm  and then pdx1-expressing pancreatic lineages using mesodermal-derived supporting cells, m <dig>  using this method, resulting es cell-derived de and pdx1-expressing cells were isolated by cell sorting, and their gene expression profiles were investigated with dna microarray. genes that were specifically expressed in de and/or in pdx1-expressing cells were extracted and their expression patterns in normal embryonic development were studied.


RESULTS
genes whose expression increased in de and pdx <dig> positive cells compared to the undifferentiated es cells were chosen and in situ hybridizations were performed. out of  <dig> genes examined,  <dig> were expressed in the de of e <dig>  mouse embryos and  <dig> genes were expressed in distinct domains in the pancreatic buds of e <dig>  embryos. among those genes expressed were foxq <dig>  cpm, foxp <dig>  pcdh <dig>  and zmiz <dig>  which were previously reported in other endodermal tissues. genes, such as parm <dig>  tmem184a, hipk <dig> and sox <dig> were reported to be expressed during early pancreatic development. nptx <dig>  c2cd4b, tcf7l <dig> and kiss1r were reported to be associated with beta cell or pancreatic functions in the adult. akr1c <dig>  aebp <dig>  pbxip <dig> and creb3l <dig>  were novel and have not been described as being expressed either in de or the pancreas.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> genes, including  <dig> novel genes expressed in de and pancreatic progenitor cells during normal development using an es cell in vitro differentiation system. these results showed that de cells and pdx1/gfp-expressing cells obtained from our m <dig> based differentiation method mimic cells during the normal developmental processes. additionally, es cells are an excellent model for studies of early developmental processes.
