BACKGROUND
the zebrafish has been suggested as a model system for studying human diseases that affect nervous system function and motor output. however, few of the ion channels that control neuronal activity in zebrafish have been characterized. here, we have identified zebrafish orthologs of voltage-dependent kv <dig>  k+ channels. kv <dig> channels have specialized gating properties that facilitate high-frequency, repetitive firing in fast-spiking neurons. mutations in human kv <dig>  cause spinocerebellar ataxia type  <dig> , an autosomal dominant genetic disease that exists in distinct neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative forms. to assess the potential usefulness of the zebrafish as a model system for sca <dig>  we have characterized the functional properties of zebrafish kv <dig>  channels with and without mutations analogous to those that cause sca <dig> 


RESULTS
the zebrafish genome  contains six kv <dig> family members including two kv <dig>  genes , one kv <dig>  gene , two kv <dig>  genes , and one kv <dig>  gene . both kv <dig>  genes are expressed during early development. zebrafish kv <dig>  channels exhibit strong functional and structural homology with mammalian kv <dig>  channels. zebrafish kv <dig>  activates over a depolarized voltage range and deactivates rapidly. an amino-terminal extension mediates fast, n-type inactivation. the kcnc3a gene is alternatively spliced, generating variant carboxyl-terminal sequences. the r335h mutation in the s <dig> transmembrane segment, analogous to the sca <dig> mutation r420h, eliminates functional expression. when co-expressed with wild type, r335h subunits suppress kv <dig>  activity by a dominant negative mechanism. the f363l mutation in the s <dig> transmembrane segment, analogous to the sca <dig> mutation f448l, alters channel gating. f363l shifts the voltage range for activation in the hyperpolarized direction and dramatically slows deactivation.


CONCLUSIONS
the functional properties of zebrafish kv <dig>  channels are consistent with a role in facilitating fast, repetitive firing of action potentials in neurons. the functional effects of sca <dig> mutations are well conserved between human and zebrafish kv <dig>  channels. the high degree of homology between human and zebrafish kv <dig>  channels suggests that the zebrafish will be a useful model system for studying pathogenic mechanisms in sca <dig>
