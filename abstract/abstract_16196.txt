BACKGROUND
basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factors , which are widely distributed in eukaryotic organisms, play crucial roles in plant development. however, no comprehensive analysis of the bhlh family in wheat  has been undertaken previously.


RESULTS
in this study,  <dig> bhlh tfs predicted from wheat using genomic and rna sequencing data were subjected to identification, classification, phylogenetic reconstruction, conserved motif characterization, chromosomal distribution determination and expression pattern analysis. one basic region, two helix regions and one loop region were found to be conserved in wheat bhlh tfs. the bhlh proteins could be separated into four categories based on sequences in their basic regions. neighbor-joining-based phylogenetic analysis of conserved bhlh domains from wheat, arabidopsis and rice identified  <dig> subfamilies of bhlh tfs, of which  <dig> were found in wheat. a total of  <dig> wheat bhlh genes had orthologs in arabidopsis , rice  and both of them . seven tissue-specific bhlh tf clusters were identified according to their expression patterns in endosperm, aleurone, seedlings, heading-stage spikes, flag leaves, shoots and roots. expression levels of six endosperm-specifically expressed tfs measured by qpcr and rna-seq showed a good correlation.


CONCLUSIONS
the  <dig> bhlh transcription factors identified from wheat could be classed into  <dig> subfamilies, and those members from the same subfamily with similar sequence motifs generally have similar expression patterns.
