BACKGROUND
tissues and their component cells have unique dna methylation profiles comprising dna methylation patterns of tissue-dependent and differentially methylated regions . previous studies reported that dna methylation plays crucial roles in cell differentiation and development. here, we investigated the genome-wide dna methylation profiles of mouse neural progenitors derived from different developmental stages using hpych4iv, a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme that recognizes acgt residues, which are uniformly distributed across the genome.


RESULTS
using a microarray-based genome-wide dna methylation analysis system focusing on  <dig> -kb regions around transcription start sites , we analyzed the dna methylation profiles of mouse neurospheres derived from telencephalons at embryonic days  <dig>   and  <dig>   and the adult brain . we identified t-dmrs with different dna methylation statuses between e <dig> nsph and e <dig> nsph at genes involved in neural development and/or associated with neurological disorders in humans, such as dclk <dig>  nrcam, nfia, and ntng <dig>  these t-dmrs were located not only within 2 kb but also distal  from the tsss, and those hypomethylated in e <dig> nsph tended to be in cpg island  associated genes. most t-dmrs that were hypomethylated in neurospheres were also hypomethylated in the adbr. interestingly, among the t-dmrs hypomethylated in the progenitors, there were t-dmrs that were hypermethylated in the adbr. although certain genes, including ntng <dig>  had hypermethylated t-dmrs 5′ upstream, we identified hypomethylated t-dmrs in the adbr, 3′ downstream from their tsss. this observation could explain why ntng <dig> was highly expressed in the adbr despite upstream hypermethylation.


CONCLUSIONS
mouse adult brain dna methylation and gene expression profiles could be attributed to developmental dynamics of t-dmrs in neural-related genes.
