BACKGROUND
the heat shock response, induced by cytoplasmic proteotoxic stress, is one of the most highly conserved transcriptional responses. this response, driven by the heat shock transcription factor hsf <dig>  restores proteostasis through the induction of molecular chaperones and other genes. in addition to stress-dependent functions, hsf <dig> has also been implicated in various stress-independent functions. in c. elegans, the hsf <dig> homolog hsf- <dig> is an essential protein that is required to mount a stress-dependent response, as well as to coordinate various stress-independent processes including development, metabolism, and the regulation of lifespan. in this work, we have performed rna-sequencing for c. elegans cultured in the presence and absence of hsf- <dig> rnai followed by treatment with or without heat shock. this experimental design thus allows for the determination of both heat shock-dependent and -independent biological targets of hsf- <dig> on a genome-wide level.


RESULTS
our results confirm that c. elegans hsf- <dig> can regulate gene expression in both a stress-dependent and -independent fashion. almost all genes regulated by hs require hsf- <dig>  reinforcing the central role of this transcription factor in the response to heat stress. as expected, major categories of hsf-1-regulated genes include cytoprotection, development, metabolism, and aging. within both the heat stress-dependent and -independent gene groups, significant numbers of genes are upregulated as well as downregulated, demonstrating that hsf- <dig> can both activate and repress gene expression either directly or indirectly. surprisingly, the cellular process most highly regulated by hsf- <dig>  both with and without heat stress, is cuticle structure. via network analyses, we identify a nuclear hormone receptor as a common link between genes that are regulated by hsf- <dig> in a hs-dependent manner, and an epidermal growth factor receptor as a common link between genes that are regulated by hsf- <dig> in a hs-independent manner. hsf- <dig> therefore coordinates various physiological processes in c. elegans, and hsf- <dig> activity may be coordinated across tissues by nuclear hormone receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor signaling.


CONCLUSIONS
this work provides genome-wide hsf- <dig> regulatory networks in c. elegans that are both heat stress-dependent and -independent. we show that hsf- <dig> is responsible for regulating many genes outside of classical heat stress-responsive genes, including genes involved in development, metabolism, and aging. the findings that a nuclear hormone receptor may coordinate the hs-induced hsf- <dig> transcriptional response, while an epidermal growth factor receptor may coordinate the hs-independent response, indicate that these factors could promote cell non-autonomous signaling that occurs through hsf- <dig>  finally, this work highlights the genes involved in cuticle structure as important hsf- <dig> targets that may play roles in promoting both cytoprotection as well as longevity.
