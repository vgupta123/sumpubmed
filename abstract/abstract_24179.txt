BACKGROUND
cell scattering is a physiological process executed by stem and progenitor cells during embryonic liver development and postnatal organ regeneration. here, we investigated the genomic events occurring during this process induced by functional blockade of α5β <dig> integrin in liver progenitor cells.


RESULTS
cells treated with a specific antibody against α5β <dig> integrin exhibited cell spreading and scattering, over-expression of liver stem/progenitor cell markers and activation of the erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapks signaling cascades, in a similar manner to the process triggered by hgf/sf <dig> stimulation. gene expression profiling revealed marked transcriptional changes of genes involved in cell adhesion and migration, as well as genes encoding chromatin remodeling factors. these responses were accompanied by conspicuous spatial reorganization of centromeres, while integrin genes conserved their spatial positioning in the interphase nucleus.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our results demonstrate that α5β <dig> integrin functional blockade induces cell migration of hepatic progenitor cells, and that this involves a dramatic remodeling of the nuclear landscape.
