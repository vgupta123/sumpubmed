BACKGROUND
human brain microvascular endothelial cells  are integral part of the blood brain barrier. post-translational modifications of adherens junction proteins regulate the permeability of human brain microvascular endothelial cells. pro-inflammatory signals can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of adherens junction proteins. the primary objective of this work is to provide a molecular model; how the hiv- <dig> tat protein can compromise the bbb integrity and eventually lead to neurological consequences. we exposed hbmvecs to recombinant hiv- <dig> clade c tat protein to study the effect of hiv- <dig> tat c on permeability of hbmvecs. trans-endothelial electrical resistance and fluorescent dye migration assay have been used to check the permeability of hbmvecs. dcfda staining has been used for intracellular reactive oxygen species  detection. western blotting has been used to study the expression levels and co-immunoprecipitation has been used to study the interactions among adherens junction proteins.


RESULTS
hiv- <dig> tat c protein induced nox <dig> and nox <dig> expression level and increased intracellular ros level. redox-sensitive kinase; pyk <dig> activation led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of ve-cadherin and β-catenin, leading to disruption of junctional assembly. the dissociation of tyrosine phosphatases ve-ptp and shp <dig> from cadherin complex resulted into increased tyrosine phosphorylation of ve-cadherin and β-catenin in hiv- <dig> tat c treated hbmvecs.


CONCLUSIONS
unrestricted phosphorylation of junctional proteins in hbmvecs, in response to hiv- <dig> tat c protein; leads to the disruption of junctional complexes and increased endothelial permeability.
