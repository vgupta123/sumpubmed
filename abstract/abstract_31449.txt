BACKGROUND
crocus sativus stigmas form rich source of apocarotenoids like crocin, picrocrocin and saffranal which besides imparting color, flavour and aroma to saffron spice also have tremendous pharmacological properties. inspite of their importance, the biosynthetic pathway of crocus apocarotenoids is not fully elucidated. moreover, the mechanism of their stigma specific accumulation remains unknown. therefore, deep transcriptome sequencing of crocus stigma and rest of the flower tissue was done to identify the genes and transcriptional regulators involved in the biosynthesis of these compounds.


RESULTS
transcriptome of stigma and rest of the flower tissue was sequenced using illumina genome analyzer iix platform which generated  <dig> , <dig> flower and  <dig> , <dig> stigma reads. sequences were assembled de novo using trinity resulting in  <dig>  transcripts which were classified into  <dig>  unigenes comprising of  <dig> clusters and  <dig>  singletons. a comprehensive functional annotation and gene ontology  analysis was carried out.  <dig>  % of the transcripts showed similarity to sequences present in public databases while rest could be specific to crocus.  <dig> transcripts showed similarity to transcription factors representing  <dig> families out of which myb family was most abundant. many genes involved in carotenoid/apocarotenoid pathway were identified for the first time in this study which includes zeta-carotene isomerase and desaturase, carotenoid isomerase and lycopene epsilon-cyclase. go analysis showed that the predominant classes in biological process category include metabolic process followed by cellular process and primary metabolic process. kegg mapping analysis indicated that pathways involved in ribosome, carbon and starch and sucrose metabolism were highly represented. differential expression analysis indicated that key carotenoid/apocarotenoid pathway genes including phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase  <dig> are enriched in stigma thereby providing molecular proof for stigma to be the site of apocarotenoid biosynthesis.


CONCLUSIONS
this data would provide a rich source for understanding the carotenoid/apocarotenoid metabolism in crocus. the database would also help in investigating many questions related to saffron biology including flower development.
