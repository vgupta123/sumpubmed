BACKGROUND
sporothrix schenckii is a pathogenic dimorphic fungus of worldwide distribution. it grows in the saprophytic form with hyaline, regularly septated hyphae and pyriform conidia at 25°c and as the yeast or parasitic form at 35°c. previously, we characterized a calcium/calmodulin kinase in this fungus. inhibitors of this kinase were observed to inhibit the yeast cell cycle in s. schenckii.


RESULTS
the presence of rna interference  mechanism in this fungus was confirmed by the identification of a dicer- <dig> homologue in s. schenckii dna. rnai technology was used to corroborate the role of calcium/calmodulin kinase i in s. schenckii dimorphism. yeast cells were transformed with the psilent-dual2g  plasmid w/wo inserts of the coding region of the calcium/calmodulin kinase i  gene. transformants were selected at 35°c using resistance to geneticin. following transfer to liquid medium at 35°c, rnai transformants developed as abnormal mycelium clumps and not as yeast cells as would be expected. the level of sscmk <dig> gene expression in rnai transformants at 35°c was less than that of cells transformed with the empty psd2g at this same temperature. yeast two-hybrid analysis of proteins that interact with sscmk <dig> identified a homologue of heat shock protein  <dig>  as interacting with this kinase. growth of the fungus similar to that of the rnai transformants was observed in medium with geldanamycin , an inhibitor of hsp <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
using the rnai technology we silenced the expression of sscmk <dig> gene in this fungus. rnai transformants were unable to grow as yeast cells at 35°c showing decreased tolerance to this temperature. the interaction of sscmk <dig> with hsp <dig>  observed using the yeast two-hybrid assay suggests that this kinase is involved in thermotolerance through its interaction with hsp <dig>  sscmk <dig> interacted with the c terminal domain of hsp <dig> where effector proteins and co-chaperones interact. these results confirmed sscmk <dig> as an important enzyme involved in the dimorphism of s. schenckii, necessary for the development of the yeast phase of this fungus. also this study constitutes the first report of the transformation of s. schenckii and the use of rnai to study gene function in this fungus.
