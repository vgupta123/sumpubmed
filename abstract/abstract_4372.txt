BACKGROUND
the multisubunit sin <dig> complex is a global transcriptional regulator. in drosophila, a single sin3a gene encodes different isoforms of sin <dig>  of which sin <dig>  <dig> and sin <dig>  <dig> are the major isoforms. previous studies have demonstrated functional non-redundancy of sin <dig> isoforms. the role of sin <dig> isoforms in regulating distinct biological processes, however, is not well characterized.


RESULTS
we established a drosophila s <dig> cell culture model system in which cells predominantly express either sin <dig>  <dig> or sin <dig>  <dig>  to identify genomic targets of sin <dig> isoforms, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing. our data demonstrate that upon overexpression of sin <dig>  <dig>  the level of sin <dig>  <dig> decreased and the large majority of genomic sites bound by sin <dig>  <dig> were instead bound by sin <dig>  <dig>  we used rna-seq to identify genes regulated by the expression of one isoform or the other. in s <dig> cells, which predominantly express sin <dig>  <dig>  we found that sin <dig>  <dig> directly regulates genes involved in metabolism and cell proliferation. we also determined that sin <dig>  <dig> regulates a unique set of genes and likely modulates expression of many genes also regulated by sin <dig>  <dig>  interestingly, biological pathways enriched for genes specifically regulated by sin <dig>  <dig> strongly suggest that this isoform plays an important role during the transition from the embryonic to the larval stage of development.


CONCLUSIONS
these data establish the role of sin <dig> isoforms in regulating distinct biological processes. this study substantially contributes to our understanding of the complexity of gene regulation by sin <dig>
