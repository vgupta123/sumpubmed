BACKGROUND
copy number variations  represent a significant source of genomic structural variation. their length ranges from approximately one hundred to millions of base pair. genome-wide screenings have clarified that cnvs are a ubiquitous phenomenon affecting essentially the whole genome. although bos taurus is one of the most important domestic animal species worldwide and one of the most studied ruminant models for metabolism, reproduction, and disease, relatively few studies have investigated cnvs in cattle and little is known about how cnvs contribute to normal phenotypic variation and to disease susceptibility in this species, compared to humans and other model organisms.


RESULTS
here we characterize and compare cnv profiles in  <dig> animals from five dairy and beef bos taurus breeds, using the illumina bovinesnp <dig> genotyping array . in this study we applied the two most commonly used algorithms for cnv discovery  and identified  <dig> unique candidate cnvs belonging to  <dig> regions. these regions overlap with  <dig> known genes,  <dig> % of which are significantly co-localized with segmental duplications .


CONCLUSIONS
this large scale screening significantly contributes to the enrichment of the bos taurus cnv map, demonstrates the ubiquity, great diversity and complexity of this type of genomic variation and sets the basis for testing the influence of cnvs on bos taurus complex functional and production traits.
