BACKGROUND
we attempted to clone candidate genes on 10p14â€“ <dig> which may regulate htert expression, through exon trapping using  <dig> bac clones covering the region. after obtaining  <dig> exons, we examined the function of rgm <dig>  we cloned from primary cultured human hepatocytes and hepatoma cell lines. we confirmed approximately  <dig> bp products digested by dicer, and investigated the function of this cloned gene and its involvement in htert expression by transfecting the hepatoma cell lines with full-length dsrna, gene-specific designed sirna, and shrna-generating plasmid.


RESULTS
rgm <dig> showed cancer-dominant intense expression similar to htert in cancer cell lines, whereas very weak expression was evident in human primary hepatocytes without telomerase activity. this gene was predicted to be a noncoding precursor rna gene. interestingly, rgm <dig> dsrna, sirna, and shrna inhibited more than 80% of htert mrna expression. in contrast, primary cultured cells overexpressing the gene showed no significant change in htert mrna expression; the overexpression of the gene strongly suppressed htert mrna in poorly differentiated cells.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings indicate that rgm <dig> might be a microrna precursor gene involved in the differentiation and function upstream of htert.
