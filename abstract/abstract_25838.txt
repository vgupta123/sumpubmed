BACKGROUND
microrna  are a class of small rnas that regulate gene expression by inhibiting translation of protein encoding transcripts. to evaluate the role of mir in skeletal muscle of swine, global microrna abundance was measured at specific developmental stages including proliferating satellite cells, three stages of fetal growth, day-old neonate, and the adult.


RESULTS
twelve potential novel mir were detected that did not match previously reported sequences. in addition, a number of mir previously reported to be expressed in mammalian muscle were detected, having a variety of abundance patterns through muscle development. muscle-specific mir- <dig> was nearly absent in proliferating satellite cells in culture, but was the highest abundant mir at other time points evaluated. in addition, mir- <dig> was moderately abundant throughout developmental stages with highest abundance in the adult. in contrast, mir- <dig> was moderately abundant in adult muscle and either not detectable or lowly abundant throughout fetal and neonate development. changes in abundance of ubiquitously expressed mir were also observed. mir- <dig> abundance was highest at the earliest stage of fetal development tested  and decreased throughout development to the adult. conversely, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> exhibited greatest abundance in proliferating satellite cells and the adult, while abundance of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir-423-5p was greatest in the neonate.


CONCLUSIONS
these data present a complete set of transcriptome profiles to evaluate mir abundance at specific stages of skeletal muscle growth in swine. identification of these mir provides an initial group of mir that may play a vital role in muscle development and growth.
