BACKGROUND
two entomopathogenic fungi, isaria fumosorosea and metarhizium anisopliae, and one bacterium, bacillus thuringiensis, were tested for their ability to cause mortality of formosan subterranean termites , coptotermes formosanus , after liquid exposure, and for their lack of propensity to repel fst.


RESULTS
the fungus isaria fumosorosea at  <dig> spores/ml caused  <dig> % mortality on day  <dig>  significantly higher than the control and  <dig> spores/ml treatment. on day  <dig>  the  <dig> and  <dig> concentrations caused  <dig> % and  <dig> % mortality, respectively, significantly higher than the control. on day  <dig>   <dig> % and 100% of the termites were killed by the  <dig> and  <dig> treatments, respectively. i. fumosorosea did not repel termites at  <dig> nor  <dig> spores/g in sand, soil or sawdust. the fungus metarhizium anisopliae at  <dig> spores/ml caused  <dig> % mortality on day  <dig>   <dig> % mortality on day  <dig> and 100% mortality on day  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
on all three days the rate of mortality was significantly higher than that of the control and  <dig> spores/ml treatment with i. fumosorosea. neither i. fumosorosea nor m. anisopliae caused repellency of fst in sand, soil or sawdust. the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis did not cause significant mortality on days  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  when termites were exposed to cells of b. thuringiensis in sawdust and when termites were exposed to a mixture of spores and cells in sand, a significantly higher number remained in the control tubes. repellency was not seen with b. thuringiensis spores alone, nor with the above treatments in the other substrates.
