BACKGROUND
the trace amine associated receptor family is a diverse array of gpcrs that arose before the first vertebrates walked on land. trace amine associated receptor  <dig>  is a wide spectrum aminergic receptor that acts as a modulator in brain monoaminergic systems. other trace amine associated receptors appear to relate to environmental perception and show a birth-and-death pattern in mammals similar to olfactory receptors.


RESULTS
across mammals, avians, and amphibians, the taar <dig> gene is intact and appears to be under strong purifying selection based on rates of amino acid fixation compared to neutral mutations. we have found that in dogs it has become a pseudogene. our analyses using a comparative genetics approach revealed that the pseudogenization event predated the emergence of the canini tribe rather than being coincident with canine domestication. by assessing the effects of the taar <dig> agonist Î²-phenylethylamine on dopamine uptake in canine striatal synaptosomes and comparing the degree and pattern of uptake inhibition to that seen in other mammals, including taar <dig> knockout mice, wild type mice and rhesus monkey, we found that the taar <dig> pseudogenization event resulted in an uncompensated loss of function.


CONCLUSIONS
the gene family has seen expansions among certain mammals, notably rodents, and reductions in others, including primates. by placing the trace amine associated receptors in an evolutionary context we can better understand their function and their potential associations with behavior and neurological disease.
