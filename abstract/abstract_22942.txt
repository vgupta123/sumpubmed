BACKGROUND
chemical bioavailability is an important dose metric in environmental risk assessment. although many approaches have been used to evaluate bioavailability, not a single approach is free from limitations. previously, we developed a new genomics-based approach that integrated microarray technology and regression modeling for predicting bioavailability  of explosives compounds in exposed earthworms. in the present study, we further compared  <dig> different regression models and performed variable selection simultaneously with parameter estimation.


RESULTS
this refined approach was applied to both previously collected and newly acquired earthworm microarray gene expression datasets for three explosive compounds. our results demonstrate that a prediction accuracy of r2 =  <dig> – <dig>  was achievable at a relatively low model complexity with as few as 3– <dig> predictor genes per model. these results are much more encouraging than our previous ones. 


CONCLUSIONS
this study has demonstrated that our approach is promising for bioavailability measurement, which warrants further studies of mixed contamination scenarios in field settings
