BACKGROUND
dna methylation and histone deacetylation are epigenetic mechanisms that play major roles in eukaryotic gene regulation. we hypothesize that many genes in the human hepatoma cell line hepg <dig> are regulated by dna methylation and histone deacetylation. treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine  to inhibit dna methylation with and/or trichostatin a  to inhibit histone deacetylation should allow us to identify genes that are regulated epigenetically in hepatoma cells.


RESULTS
5-aza-dc had a much larger effect on gene expression in hepg <dig> cells than did tsa, as measured using affymetrixÂ® hg-u <dig> plus  <dig>  microarrays. the expression of  <dig> probe sets was affected by 5-aza-dc ,  <dig> probe sets by tsa, and  <dig> probe sets by the combination of 5-aza-dc and tsa. 5-aza-dc treatment turned on the expression of  <dig> probe sets that were not detectably expressed in its absence. expression of imprinted genes regulated by dna methylation, such as h <dig> and nnat, was turned on or greatly increased in response to 5-aza-dc. genes involved in liver processes such as xenobiotic metabolism  and steroid biosynthesis , and genes encoding ccaat element-binding proteins  were affected by 5-aza-dc or the combination. many of the genes that fall within these groups are also expressed in the developing fetal liver and adult liver. quantitative real-time rt-pcr assays confirmed selected gene expression changes seen in microarray analyses.


CONCLUSIONS
epigenetics play a role in regulating the expression of several genes involved in essential liver processes such as xenobiotic metabolism and steroid biosynthesis in hepg <dig> cells. many genes whose expression is normally silenced in these hepatoma cells were re-expressed by 5-aza-dc treatment. dna methylation may be a factor in restricting the expression of fetal genes during liver development and in shutting down expression in hepatoma cells.
