BACKGROUND
we have recently discovered that the two tryptophans of human β2-microglobulin have distinctive roles within the structure and function of the protein. deeply buried in the core, trp <dig> is essential for folding stability, whereas trp <dig>  which is solvent-exposed, plays a crucial role in promoting the binding of β2-microglobulin to the heavy chain of the class i major histocompatibility complex . we have previously shown that the thermodynamic disadvantage of having trp <dig> exposed on the surface is counter-balanced by the perfect fit between it and a cavity within the mhci heavy chain that contributes significantly to the functional stabilization of the mhci. therefore, based on the peculiar differences of the two tryptophans, we have analysed the evolution of β2-microglobulin with respect to these residues.


RESULTS
having defined the β2-microglobulin protein family, we performed multiple sequence alignments and analysed the residue conservation in homologous proteins to generate a phylogenetic tree. our results indicate that trp <dig> is highly conserved, whereas some species have a leu in position 95; the replacement of trp <dig> with leu destabilizes β2-microglobulin by  <dig> kcal/mol and accelerates the kinetics of unfolding. both thermodynamic and kinetic data fit with the crystallographic structure of the trp95leu variant, which shows how the hydrophobic cavity of the wild-type protein is completely occupied by trp <dig>  but is only half filled by leu <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we have established that the functional trp <dig> has been present within the sequence of β2-microglobulin since the evolutionary appearance of proteins responsible for acquired immunity, whereas the structural trp <dig> was selected and stabilized, most likely, for its capacity to fully occupy an internal cavity of the protein thereby creating a better stabilization of its folded state.
