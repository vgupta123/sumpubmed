BACKGROUND
the desiccation-tolerant moss bryum argenteum is an important component of the biological soil crusts  found in the gurbantunggut desert. desiccation tolerance is defined as the ability to revive from the air dried state. to elucidate the molecular mechanisms related to desiccation tolerance, we employed rna-seq and digital gene expression  technologies to study the genome-wide expression profiles of the dehydration and rehydration processes in this important desert plant.


RESULTS
we applied a two-step approach to investigate the gene expression profile upon rehydration in the moss bryum argenteum using illumina hiseq <dig> sequencing platform. first, a total of  <dig>  transcript assembly contigs  were obtained from  <dig>  million reads by de novo assembly, with an average length of 863 bp and n <dig> of  <dig>  bp. among the reconstructed tacs,  <dig>   revealed similarity with existing protein sequences in the public databases.  <dig>  and  <dig>  tacs were assigned go and kegg annotation information, respectively. second, samples were taken from  <dig> hydration stages: desiccated , rehydrated 2 h  and rehydrated 24 h , and deg libraries were constructed for differentially expressed genes  discovery.  <dig>  and  <dig>  degs were identified in r <dig> and r <dig>  compared with dry, respectively. compared to the desiccated sample, up-regulated genes after two hours of hydration are primarily related to stress responses. go function enrichment network, ekgg metabolic pathway and mapman analysis supports the idea of the rapid recovery of photosynthesis after 24 h of rehydration. we identified  <dig> transcription factors  which were classified into  <dig> tf families.  <dig> tf transcripts were up-regulated upon rehydration including  <dig> members of the erf family.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we constructed a pioneering, high-quality reference transcriptome in b. argenteum and generated three dge libraries to elucidate the changes of gene expression upon rehydration. expression profiles consistent with the rapid recovery of photosynthesis  and the re-establishment of a positive carbon balance following rehydration  were observed. our study will extend our knowledge of bryophyte transcriptomes and provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms related to rehydration and desiccation-tolerance.
