BACKGROUND
both large deletions in genome and heat shock stress would lead to alterations in the gene expression profile; however, whether there is any potential linkage between these disturbances to the transcriptome have not been discovered. here, the relationship between the genomic and environmental contributions to the transcriptome was analyzed by comparing the transcriptomes of the bacterium escherichia coli  grown in regular and transient heat shock conditions.


RESULTS
the transcriptome analysis showed the following:  there was a reorganization of the transcriptome in accordance with preferred chromosomal periodicity upon genomic or heat shock perturbation;  there was a considerable overlap between the perturbed regulatory networks and the categories enriched for differentially expressed genes  following genome reduction and heat shock;  the genes sensitive to genome reduction tended to be located close to genomic scars, and some were also highly responsive to heat shock; and  the genomic and environmental contributions to the transcriptome displayed not only a positive correlation but also a negatively compensated relationship .


CONCLUSIONS
the contributions of genome reduction and heat shock to the escherichia coli transcriptome were evaluated at multiple levels. the observations of overlapping perturbed networks, directional similarity in transcriptional changes, positive correlation and epistatic nature linked the two contributions and suggest somehow a crosstalk guiding transcriptional reorganization in response to both genetic and environmental disturbances in bacterium e. coli.
