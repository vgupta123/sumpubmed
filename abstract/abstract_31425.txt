BACKGROUND
the protection of canola  crops against blackleg disease, caused by the fungal pathogen leptosphaeria maculans, is largely mediated by race-specific resistance genes . while many r-genes effective against blackleg disease have been identified in brassica species, information of the precise genomic locations of the genes is limited.


RESULTS
in this study, the rlm <dig> gene for resistance to blackleg, located on chromosome a <dig> of the b. napus cultivar ‘glacier’, was targeted for fine mapping. molecular markers tightly linked to the gene were developed for use in mapping the resistance locus and defining the physical interval in b. napus. rlm <dig> was localised to a  <dig>  cm interval corresponding to approximately 873 kb of the b. napus chromosome a <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the recently-cloned b. napus r-gene, lepr <dig>  occupies the same region of a <dig> as rlm <dig> and analysis of the putative b. napus and b. rapa genes in the homologous region identified several additional candidate defense-related genes that may control rlm <dig> function.
