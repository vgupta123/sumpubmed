BACKGROUND
natural product-likeness of a molecule, i.e. similarity of this molecule to the structure space covered by natural products, is a useful criterion in screening compound libraries and in designing new lead compounds. a closed source implementation of a natural product-likeness score, that finds its application in virtual screening, library design and compound selection, has been previously reported by one of us. in this note, we report an open-source and open-data re-implementation of this scoring system, illustrate its efficiency in ranking small molecules for natural product likeness and discuss its potential applications.


RESULTS
the natural-product-likeness scoring system is implemented as taverna  <dig>  workflows, and is available under creative commons attribution-share alike  <dig>  unported license at http://www.myexperiment.org/packs/ <dig> html. it is also available for download as executable standalone java package from http://sourceforge.net/projects/np-likeness/under academic free license.


CONCLUSIONS
our open-source, open-data natural-product-likeness scoring system can be used as a filter for metabolites in computer assisted structure elucidation or to select natural-product-like molecules from molecular libraries for the use as leads in drug discovery.
