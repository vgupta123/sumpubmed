BACKGROUND
photoperiod-sensitive flowering is a key adaptive trait for sorghum  in west and central africa. in this study we performed an association analysis to investigate the effect of polymorphisms within the genes putatively related to variation in flowering time on photoperiod-sensitive flowering in sorghum. for this purpose a genetically characterized panel of  <dig> sorghum accessions from west and central africa was evaluated for their photoperiod response index  based on two sowing dates under field conditions.


RESULTS
sorghum accessions used in our study were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms  in six genes putatively involved in the photoperiodic control of flowering time. applying a mixed model approach and previously-determined population structure parameters to these candidate genes, we found significant associations between several snps with pri for the genes cryptochrome  <dig>  and gigantea .


CONCLUSIONS
the negative values of tajima's d, found for the genes of our study, suggested that purifying selection has acted on genes involved in photoperiodic control of flowering time in sorghum. the snp markers of our study that showed significant associations with pri can be used to create functional markers to serve as important tools for marker-assisted selection of photoperiod-sensitive cultivars in sorghum.
