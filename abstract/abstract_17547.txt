BACKGROUND
changes in neuronal excitability, synaptic efficacy and generally in cell signaling often result from insertion of key molecules into plasma membrane . many of the techniques used for monitoring pm insertion lack either spatial or temporal resolution.


RESULTS
we improved the imaging method based on time-lapse total internal reflection fluorescence  microscopy and phluorin tagging by supplementing it with a repetitive extracellular acidification protocol. we illustrate the applicability of this method by showing that brief activation of nmda receptors  in cultured hippocampal neurons induced a persistent pm insertion of glutamate receptors containing the phluorin-tagged glur-a subunits.


CONCLUSIONS
the repetitive acidification technique provides a more accurate way of monitoring the pm-inserted fraction of fluorescently tagged molecules and offers a good temporal and spatial resolution.
