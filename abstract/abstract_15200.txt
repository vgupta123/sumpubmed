BACKGROUND
adventitious root  formation is a critical step in vegetative propagation of most ornamental plants, such as carnation. ar formation from stem cuttings is usually divided into several stages according to physiological and metabolic markers. auxin is often applied exogenously to promote the development of ars on stem cuttings of difficult-to-root genotypes.


RESULTS
by whole transcriptome sequencing, we identified the genes involved in ar formation in carnation cuttings and in response to exogenous auxin. their expression profiles have been analysed through rna-seq during a time-course experiment in the stem cutting base of two cultivars with contrasting efficiencies of ar formation. we explored the kinetics of root primordia formation in these two cultivars and in response to exogenously-applied auxin through detailed histological and physiological analyses.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide, for the first time, a number of molecular, histological and physiological markers that characterize the different stages of ar formation in this species and that could be used to monitor adventitious rooting on a wide collection of carnation germplasm with the aim to identify the best-rooting cultivars for breeding purposes.
