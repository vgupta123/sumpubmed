BACKGROUND
grouper  is an economically important fish species worldwide. however, viral pathogens such as nervous necrosis virus  have been causing severe infections in the fish, resulting in great loss in the grouper aquaculture industry. yet, the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of nnv is still inadequate, mainly due to insufficient genomic information of the host.


RESULTS
de novo assembly of grouper transcriptome in the grouper kidney  cells was conducted by using short read sequencing technology of solexa/illumina. a sum of  <dig>  unigenes with mean length of  <dig> bp were obtained, and were annotated according to gene ontology  and clusters of orthologous groups . in addition, the tag-based digital gene expression  system was used to investigate the gene expression and pathways associated with nnv infection in gk cells. the analysis revealed endoplasmic reticulum  stress response was prominently affected in nnv-infected gk cells. a further analysis revealed an interaction between the nnv capsid protein and the er chaperone immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein . furthermore, exogenous expression of nnv capsid protein was able to induce xbp- <dig> mrna splicing in vivo, suggesting a role of the capsid protein in the nnv-induced er stress.


CONCLUSIONS
our data presents valuable genetic information for epinephelus spp., which will benefit future study in this non-model but economically important species. the dge profile of er stress response in nnv-infected cells provides information of many important components associated with the protein processing in er. specifically, we showed that the viral capsid protein might play an important role in the er stress response.
