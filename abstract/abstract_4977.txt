BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a new class of endogenous small rnas that play essential regulatory roles in plant growth, development and stress response. extensive studies of mirnas have been performed in model plants such as rice, arabidopsis thaliana and other plants. however, the number of mirnas discovered in maize is relatively low and little is known about mirnas involved in the very early stage during seed germination.


RESULTS
in this study, a small rna library from maize seed  <dig> hours after imbibition was sequenced by the solexa technology. a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained.  <dig> , <dig> total reads representing  <dig> unique srnas matched to known maize mirnas. further analysis confirmed the authenticity of  <dig> known mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families and the discovery of  <dig> novel mirnas in maize. both the known and the novel mirnas were confirmed by sequencing of a second small rna library constructed the same way as the one used in the first sequencing. we also found  <dig> mirnas that had not been reported in maize, but had been reported in other plant species. all novel sequences had not been earlier described in other plant species. in addition, seven mirna* sequences were also obtained. putative targets for  <dig> novel mirnas were successfully predicted. our results indicated that mirna-mediated gene expression regulation is present in maize imbibed seed.


CONCLUSIONS
this study led to the confirmation of the authenticity of  <dig> known mirnas and the discovery of  <dig> novel mirnas in maize. identification of novel mirnas resulted in significant enrichment of the repertoire of maize mirnas and provided insights into mirna regulation of genes expressed in imbibed seed.
