BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori specifically takes up cholesterol and incorporates it into the bacterial membrane, yet little is currently known about cholesterol's physiological roles. we compared phenotypes and in vivo colonization ability of h. pylori grown in a defined, serum-free growth medium, f <dig> with  <dig> mg/ml albumin containing  <dig> to  <dig> μg/ml cholesterol.


RESULTS
while doubling times were largely unaffected by cholesterol, other overt phenotypic changes were observed. h. pylori strain ss <dig> grown in defined medium with cholesterol successfully colonized the stomach of gerbils, whereas ss <dig> grown without cholesterol failed to colonize. h. pylori lipopolysaccharide often displays lewis x and/or y antigens. expression of these antigens measured by whole-cell elisa was markedly enhanced in response to growth of strain ss <dig>   <dig>  or g <dig> in cholesterol. in addition, electrophoretic analysis of lipopolysaccharide in wild type g <dig> and in mutants lacking the o-chain revealed structural changes within the oligosaccharide core/lipid a moieties. these responses in lewis antigen levels and in lipopolysaccharide profiles to cholesterol availability were highly specific, because no changes took place when cholesterol was substituted by β-sitosterol or bile salts. disruption of the genes encoding cholesterol α-glucosyltransferase or lipid a phosphoethanolamine transferase had no effect on lewis expression, nor on lipopolysaccharide profiles, nor on the cholesterol responsiveness of these properties. disruption of the lipid a 1-phosphatase gene eliminated the effect of cholesterol on lipopolysaccharide profiles but not its effect on lewis expression.


CONCLUSIONS
together these results suggest that cholesterol depletion leads to aberrant forms of lps that are dependent upon dephosphorylation of lipid a at the 1-position. a tentative model for the observed effects of cholesterol is discussed in which sequential steps of lipopolysaccharide biogenesis and, independently, presentation of lewis antigen at the cell surface, depend upon membrane composition. these new findings demonstrate that cholesterol availability permits h. pylori to modify its cell envelope in ways that can impact colonization of host tissue in vivo.
