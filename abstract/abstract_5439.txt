BACKGROUND
preputial gland infection is a common occurrence in non-breeder male mice and can lead to abscesses. this report describes a surgical approach to treating and preventing this condition.


RESULTS
surgical removal of the glands was undertaken in  <dig> male c3h/henhsd mice. the glands were successfully removed in all of the animals with a low rate of post-surgery complications. abscess recurrence due to incomplete gland resection occurred in  <dig>  % of animals. surgical wound opening  and infection of the surgical site  also occurred but were treated successfully.


CONCLUSIONS
in the study described here, early intervention was successful in preventing intercurrent infection compromising both animal welfare and the outcome of the study.
