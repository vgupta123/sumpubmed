BACKGROUND
terabyte-scale collections of string-encoded data are expected from consortia efforts such as the human microbiome project http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp. intra- and inter-project data similarity searches are enabled by rapid k-mer matching strategies. software applications for sequence database partitioning, guide tree estimation, molecular classification and alignment acceleration have benefited from embedded k-mer searches as sub-routines. however, a rapid, general-purpose, open-source, flexible, stand-alone k-mer tool has not been available.


RESULTS
here we present a stand-alone utility, simrank, which allows users to rapidly identify database strings the most similar to query strings. performance testing of simrank and related tools against dna, rna, protein and human-languages found simrank 10x to 928x faster depending on the dataset.


CONCLUSIONS
simrank provides molecular ecologists with a high-throughput, open source choice for comparing large sequence sets to find similarity.
