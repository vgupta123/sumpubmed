BACKGROUND
in recent years, the use of genomic information in livestock species for genetic improvement, association studies and many other fields has become routine. in order to accommodate different market requirements in terms of genotyping cost, manufacturers of single nucleotide polymorphism  arrays, private companies and international consortia have developed a large number of arrays with different content and different snp density. the number of currently available snp arrays differs among species: ranging from one for goats to more than ten for cattle, and the number of arrays available is increasing rapidly. however, there is limited or no effort to standardize and integrate array- specific  and species-specific  snp information.


RESULTS
here we present snpchimp v. <dig>  a solution to these issues for the six major livestock species . original data was collected directly from snp array producers and specific international genome consortia, and stored in a mysql database. the database was then linked to an open-access web tool and to public databases. snpchimp v. <dig> ensures fast access to the database  and the possibility of annotating snp array data in a user-friendly fashion.


CONCLUSIONS
this platform allows easy integration and standardization, and it is aimed at both industry and research. it also enables users to easily link the information available from the array producer with data in public databases, without the need of additional bioinformatics tools or pipelines. in recognition of the open-access use of ensembl resources, snpchimp v. <dig> was officially credited as an ensembl e!mpowered tool. availability at http://bioinformatics.tecnoparco.org/snpchimp.
