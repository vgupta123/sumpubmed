BACKGROUND
phenotype of chronic rhinosinusitis  may be an important determining factor of the efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatments. although both glucocorticoids and macrolide antibiotics have been recommended for the treatment of crs, whether they have different anti-inflammatory functions for distinct phenotypic crs has not been completely understood. the aim of this study is to compare the anti-inflammatory effects of clarithromycin and dexamethasone on sinonasal mucosal explants from different phenotypic crs ex vivo.

methods
ethmoid mucosal tissues from crssnp patients , and polyp tissues from eosinophilic  and non-eosinophilic  crswnp patients were cultured in an ex vivo explant model with or without dexamethasone or clarithromycin treatment for 24 h. after culture, the production and/or expression of anti-inflammatory molecules, epithelial-derived cytokines, pro-inflammatory cytokines, t helper  <dig>  th <dig> and th <dig> cytokines, chemokines, dendritic cell relevant markers, pattern recognition receptors , and tissue remodeling factors were detected in tissue explants or culture supernatants by rt-pcr or elisa, respectively.


RESULTS
we found that both clarithromycin and dexamethasone up-regulated the production of anti-inflammatory mediators -10), whereas down-regulated the production of th <dig> response and eosinophilia promoting molecules  and th <dig> response and neutrophilia promoting molecules , from sinonasal mucosa from distinct phenotypic crs. in contrast, they had no effect on il-17a production. the expression of prrs  was induced, and the production of tissue remodeling factors  was suppressed, in different phenotypic crs by dexamethasone and clarithromycin in comparable extent.


CONCLUSIONS
out of our expectation, our explant model study discovered herein that glucocorticoids and macrolides likely exerted similar regulatory actions on crs and most of their effects did not vary by the phenotypes of crs.
