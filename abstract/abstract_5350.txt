BACKGROUND
casein kinase  <dig>  is one of few proteins known to affect cellular timekeeping across metazoans, and the naturally occurring ck1tau mutation shortens circadian period in mammals. functional conservation of a timekeeping function for ck <dig> in the green lineage was recently identified in the green marine unicell ostreococcus tauri, in spite of the absence of ck1's transcriptional targets known from other species. the short-period phenotype of ck1tau mutant in mammals depends specifically on increased ck <dig> activity against period proteins. to understand how ck <dig> acts differently upon the algal clock, we analysed the cellular and proteomic effects of ck1tau overexpression in o. tauri.


RESULTS
overexpression of the ck1tau in o. tauri induces period lengthening identical to overexpression of wild-type ck <dig>  in addition to resistance to ck <dig> inhibitor ic <dig>  label-free quantitative mass spectrometry of ck1tau overexpressing algae revealed a total of  <dig> unique phospho-sites that are differentially responsive to ck1tau. combined with ck <dig> phosphorylation site prediction tools and previously published wild-type ck1-responsive peptides, this study results in a highly stringent list of upregulated phospho-sites, derived from proteins containing ankyrin repeats, kinase proteins, and phosphoinositide-binding proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
the identical phenotype for overexpression of wild-type ck <dig> and ck1tau is in line with the absence of critical targets for rodent ck1tau in o. tauri. proteomic analyses reveal that two thirds of previously reported ck <dig> overexpression-responsive phospho-sites are shared with ck1tau. these results indicate that the two alleles are functionally indiscriminate in o. tauri, and verify the identified cellular ck <dig> target proteins in a minimal circadian model organism.
