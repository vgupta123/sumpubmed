BACKGROUND
the internal organization of cells depends on mechanisms to ensure that transport carriers, such as vesicles, fuse only with the correct destination organelle. several types of proteins have been proposed to confer specificity to this process, and we have recently shown that a set of coiled-coil proteins on the golgi, called golgins, are able to capture specific classes of carriers when relocated to an ectopic location.


RESULTS
mapping of six different golgins reveals that, in each case, a short 20– <dig> residue region is necessary and sufficient to capture specific carriers. in all six of gmap- <dig>  golgin- <dig>  tmf, golgin- <dig>  golgin- <dig>  and gcc <dig>  this region is located at the extreme n-terminus of the protein. the vesicle-capturing regions of gmap- <dig>  golgin- <dig>  and tmf capture intra-golgi vesicles and share some sequence features, suggesting that they act in a related, if distinct, manner. in the case of gmap- <dig>  this shared feature is in addition to a previously characterized “amphipathic lipid-packing sensor” motif that can capture highly curved membranes, with the two motifs being apparently involved in capturing distinct types of vesicles. of the three grip domain golgins that capture endosome-to-golgi carriers, golgin- <dig> and golgin- <dig> share a closely related capture motif, whereas that in gcc <dig> is distinct, suggesting that it works by a different mechanism and raising the possibility that the three golgins capture different classes of endosome-derived carriers that share many cargos but have distinct features for recognition at the golgi.


CONCLUSIONS
for six different golgins, the capture of carriers is mediated by a short region at the n-terminus of the protein. there appear to be at least four different types of motif, consistent with specific golgins capturing specific classes of carrier and implying the existence of distinct receptors present on each of these different carrier classes.
