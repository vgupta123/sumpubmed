BACKGROUND
mps <dig>  an essential component of the mitotic checkpoint, is also an important interphase regulator and has roles in dna damage response, cytokinesis and centrosome duplication. mps <dig> predominantly resides in the cytoplasm and relocates into the nucleus at the late g <dig> phase. so far, the mechanism underlying the mps <dig> translocation between the cytoplasm and nucleus has been unclear.


RESULTS
in this work, a dynamic export process of mps <dig> from the nucleus to cytoplasm in interphase was revealed- a process blocked by the crm <dig> inhibitor, leptomycin b, suggesting that export of mps <dig> is crm <dig> dependent. consistent with this speculation, a direct association between mps <dig> and crm <dig> was found. furthermore, a putative nuclear export sequence  motif at the n-terminal of mps <dig> was identified by analyzing the motif of mps <dig>  this motif shows a high sequence similarity to the classic nes, a fusion of this motif with egfp results in dramatic exclusion of the fusion protein from the nucleus. additionally, mps <dig> mutant loss of pnes integrity was shown by replacing leucine with alanine which produced a diffused subcellular distribution, compared to the wild type protein which resides predominantly in cytoplasm.


CONCLUSIONS
taken these findings together, it was concluded that the pnes sequence is sufficient for the mps <dig> export from nucleus during interphase.
