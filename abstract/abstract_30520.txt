BACKGROUND
the objective of this study was to increase understanding about genetic mechanisms affecting calyx persistence in korla fragrant pear . flowers were collected at early bloom, full bloom, and late bloom. the rna was extracted from the flowers and then combined according to calyx type. transcriptome and digital gene expression  profiles of flowers, ovaries, and sepals with persistent calyx  were compared with those of flowers, ovaries, and sepals with deciduous calyx . temporal changes in the expression of selected genes in floral organs with either persistent or deciduous calyx were compared using real-time quantitative pcr .


RESULTS
comparison of the transcriptome sequences for sc_hua and tl_hua indicated  <dig> differentially expressed genes  with known relationship to abscission and  <dig> degs with unknown function. we identified  <dig> myb and  <dig> spl genes from the assembled unigenes. from sc_zf vs tl_zf, we identified  <dig> degs with known relationship to abscission and  <dig> degs with unknown function. from sc_ep vs tl_ep,  <dig> degs with known relationship to abscission were identified along with  <dig> degs with unknown function. ten degs were identified by both transcriptome sequencing and dge sequencing.


CONCLUSIONS
more than  <dig> degs were observed that were related to calyx persistence in korla fragrant pear. some of the genes were related to cell wall degradation, plant hormone signal transduction, and stress response. other degs were identified as zinc finger protein genes and lipid transfer protein genes. further analysis showed that calyx persistence in korla fragment pear was a metabolic process regulated by many genes related to cell wall degradation and plant hormones.
