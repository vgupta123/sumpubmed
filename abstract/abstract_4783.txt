BACKGROUND
the aim of this study was to assess the distribution of key snare proteins in glutamatergic and gabaergic synapses of the adult rat cerebellar cortex using light microscopy immunohistochemical techniques. analysis was made of co-localizations of vglut- <dig> and vglut- <dig>  vesicular transporters of glutamate and markers of glutamatergic synapses, or gad, the gaba synthetic enzyme and marker of gabaergic synapses, with vamp- <dig>  snap-25a/b and syntaxin- <dig> 


RESULTS
the examined snare proteins were found to be diffusely expressed in glutamatergic synapses, whereas they were rarely observed in gabaergic synapses. however, among glutamatergic synapses, subpopulations which did not contain vamp- <dig>  snap-25a/b and syntaxin- <dig> were detected. they included virtually all the synapses established by terminals of climbing fibres  and some synapses established by terminals of parallel and mossy fibres . the only gaba synapses expressing the snare proteins studied were the synapses established by axon terminals of basket neurons.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study supplies a detailed morphological description of vamp- <dig>  snap-25a/b and syntaxin- <dig> in the different types of glutamatergic and gabaergic synapses of the rat cerebellar cortex. the examined snare proteins characterize most of glutamatergic synapses and only one type of gabaergic synapses. in the subpopulations of glutamatergic and gabaergic synapses lacking the snare protein isoforms examined, alternative mechanisms for regulating trafficking of synaptic vesicles may be hypothesized, possibly mediated by different isoforms or homologous proteins.
