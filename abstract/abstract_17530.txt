BACKGROUND
leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that acts via its hypothalamic receptor  to regulate energy balance. a downstream effect essential for the weight-regulatory action of leptin is the phosphorylation and activation of the latent transcription factor stat <dig> by leprb-associated janus kinases . obesity is typically associated with chronically elevated leptin levels and a decreased ability of leprb to activate intracellular signal transduction pathways . here we have studied the roles of the intracellular tyrosine residues in the negative feedback regulation of leprb-signaling under chronic leptin stimulation.


RESULTS
mutational analysis showed that the presence of either tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> in the intracellular domain of leprb was sufficient for the attenuation of stat <dig> phosphorylation, whereas mutation of both tyrosines rendered leprb resistant to feedback regulation. overexpression and rna interference-mediated downregulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling  <dig>  revealed that both tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> were capable of supporting the negative modulatory effect of socs <dig> in reporter gene assays. in contrast, the inhibitory effect of socs <dig> was enhanced by the presence of tyr <dig> but not tyr <dig>  finally, the reduction of the stat-phosphorylating activity of the leprb complex after  <dig> h of leptin stimulation was not accompanied by the dephosphorylation or degradation of leprb or the receptor-associated jak molecule, but depended on tyr <dig> and/or tyr <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
both tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> contribute to the negative regulation of leprb signaling. the inhibitory effects of socs <dig> and socs <dig> differ in the dependence on the tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of leprb.
