BACKGROUND
the nucleoside analogue arabinosylcytosine  has been used for many years in the treatment of acute leukemia. evidence in the literature suggests that arac may inhibit the growth of human colon carcinoma cell lines as well. because arac action interferes with normal nucleoside metabolism, it is highly toxic to a number of normal cell types including bone marrow and intestinal mucosa cells. here we investigate whether the omega- <dig> fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid  could selectively target arac toxicity toward colonic tumor cells while protecting the normal cells in vitro.


RESULTS
cultures of normal rat colonic epithelial cells  and those transformed by v-src  were supplemented with graded concentrations of dha or arachidonic acid  alone or in combination with arac. arac was only  <dig>  fold more toxic to d/v-src than 4d/wt in cultures without added fatty acids. supplementing with as little as  <dig> Î¼m of either aa or dha increased arac toxicity by more than 30-fold in the tumorigenic cells. the toxic effect of arac on the normal cells was also increased by the fatty acid supplementation. ic <dig> values were decreased  <dig>  fold by dha in the 4d/wt cells but a more than 7-fold decrease was observed during aa supplementation. as a result, the therapeutic index of arac  was more than 3-fold higher in the dha than the aa supplemented cells. the expression of protein kinase c isoform epsilon was decreased in aa alone supplemented d/v-src cultures but in combination with arac decreased only in dha supplemented 4d/wt cells.


CONCLUSIONS
low dose dha supplementation may enhance arac chemotherapy in colon cancer while protecting normal tissues, possibly through control of pkc signalling pathways.
