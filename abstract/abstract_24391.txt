BACKGROUND
tumour markers are standard tools for the differential diagnosis of cancer. however, the occurrence of nonspecific symptoms and different malignancies involving the same cancer site may lead to a high proportion of misclassifications.

classification accuracy can be improved by combining information from different markers using standard data mining techniques, like decision tree , artificial neural network , and k-nearest neighbour  classifier. unfortunately, each method suffers from some unavoidable limitations. dt, in general, tends to show a low classification performance, whereas ann and knn produce a "black-box" classification that does not provide biological information useful for clinical purposes.

methods
logic learning machine  is an innovative method of supervised data analysis capable of building classifiers described by a set of intelligible rules including simple conditions in their antecedent part. it is essentially an efficient implementation of the switching neural network model and reaches excellent classification accuracy while keeping low the computational demand.

llm was applied to data from a consecutive cohort of  <dig> patients admitted for diagnosis to two pulmonary departments in northern italy from  <dig> to  <dig>  patients included  <dig> malignant pleural mesotheliomas ,  <dig> pleural metastases  from other tumours and  <dig> benign diseases  associated with pleurisies. concentration of three tumour markers  was measured in the pleural fluid of each patient and a cytological examination was also carried out.

the performance of llm and that of three competing methods  was assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation.


RESULTS
llm outperformed all other considered methods. global accuracy was  <dig> % for llm,  <dig> % for dt,  <dig> % for knn, and  <dig> % for ann, respectively. in more details, llm correctly classified 79% of mpm, 66% of mtx and 89% of bd. the corresponding figures for dt were: mpm = 83%, mtx = 55% and bd = 84%; for knn: mpm = 58%, mtx = 45%, bd = 62%; for ann: mpm = 71%, mtx = 47%, bd = 76%.

finally, llm provided classification rules in a very good agreement with a priori knowledge about the biological role of the considered tumour markers.


CONCLUSIONS
llm is a new flexible tool potentially useful for the differential diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma.
