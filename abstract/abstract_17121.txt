BACKGROUND
bovine tuberculosis  control programs generally rely on the tuberculin skin test  for ante-mortem detection of mycobacterium bovis-infected cattle.


RESULTS
present findings demonstrate that a rapid antibody test based on dual-path platform  technology, when applied 1-3 weeks after tst, detected  <dig> of  <dig> and  <dig> of  <dig> tst non-reactive yet m. bovis-infected cattle from the us and gb, respectively. the specificity of the assay ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  with samples from tb-free herds. multi-antigen print immunoassay  revealed the presence of antibodies to multiple antigens of m. bovis in sera from tst non-reactors diagnosed with tb.


CONCLUSIONS
thus, use of serologic assays in series with tst can identify a significant number of tst non-reactive tuberculous cattle for more efficient removal from tb-affected herds.
