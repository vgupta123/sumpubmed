BACKGROUND
an explosive global spreading of multidrug resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis  is a catastrophe, which demands an urgent need to design or develop novel/potent antitubercular agents. the lysine/dap biosynthetic pathway is a promising target due its specific role in cell wall and amino acid biosynthesis. here, we report identification of potential antitubercular candidates targeting mtb dihydrodipicolinate synthase  enzyme of the pathway using virtual screening protocols.


RESULTS
in the present study, we generated three sets of drug-like molecules in order to screen potential inhibitors against mtb drug target dhdps. the first set of compounds was a combinatorial library, which comprised analogues of pyruvate . the second set of compounds consisted of pyruvate-like molecules i.e. structurally similar to pyruvate, obtained using 3d flexible similarity search against nci and pubchem database. the third set constituted  <dig> anti-infective molecules obtained from pubchem. these compounds were subjected to lipinski's rule of drug-like five filters. finally, three sets of drug-like compounds i.e.  <dig> pyruvate analogues,  <dig> pyruvate-like molecules and  <dig> anti-infective molecules were docked at the active site of mtb dhdps  to select inhibitors establishing favorable interactions.


CONCLUSIONS
the above-mentioned virtual screening procedures helped in the identification of several potent candidates that possess inhibitory activity against mtb dhdps. therefore, these novel scaffolds/candidates which could have the potential to inhibit mtb dhdps enzyme would represent promising starting points as lead compounds and certainly aid the experimental designing of antituberculars in lesser time.
