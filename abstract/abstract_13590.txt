BACKGROUND
expression of the lim-homeobox gene lhx <dig> in murine hematopoietic cells allows for the generation of hematopoietic stem cell -like cell lines. to address the molecular basis of lhx <dig> function, we generated hsc-like cell lines where lhx <dig> expression is regulated by a tet-on system and hence dependent on the presence of doxycyclin . these cell lines efficiently down-regulate lhx <dig> expression upon dox withdrawal leading to a rapid differentiation into various myeloid cell types.


RESULTS
global gene expression of these cell lines cultured in dox was compared to different time points after dox withdrawal using microarray technology. we identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes. the majority of the genes overlapping with hsc-specific databases were those down-regulated after turning off lhx <dig> expression and a majority of the genes overlapping with those defined as late progenitor-specific genes were the up-regulated genes, suggesting that these cell lines represent a relevant model system for normal hscs also at the level of global gene expression. moreover, in situ hybridisations of several genes down-regulated after dox withdrawal showed overlapping expression patterns with lhx <dig> in various tissues during embryonic development.


CONCLUSIONS
global gene expression analysis of hsc-like cell lines with inducible lhx <dig> expression has identified genes putatively linked to self-renewal / differentiation of hscs, and function of lhx <dig> in organ development and stem / progenitor cells of non-hematopoietic origin.
