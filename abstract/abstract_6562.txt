BACKGROUND
rett syndrome , a common cause of mental retardation in girls, is associated with mutations in the mecp <dig> gene. most human cases of mecp <dig> mutation in girls result in classical or variant forms of rtt. when these same mutations occur in males, they often present as severe neonatal encephalopathy. however, some mecp <dig> mutations can also lead to diseases characterized as mental retardation syndromes, particularly in boys. one of these mutations, a140v, is a common, recurring missense mutation accounting for about  <dig> % of all mecp <dig> mutations and ranking 21st by frequency. it has been described in familial x-linked mental retardation , ppm- x syndrome  and in other neuropsychiatric syndromes. interestingly, this mutation has been reported to preserve the methyl-cpg binding function of the mecp <dig> protein while compromising its ability to bind to the mental retardation associated protein atrx.


RESULTS
we report the construction and initial characterization of a mouse model expressing the a140v mecp <dig> mutation. these initial descriptive studies in male hemizygous mice have revealed brain abnormalities seen in both rtt and mental retardation. the abnormalities found include increases in cell packing density in the brain and a significant reduction in the complexity of neuronal dendritic branching. in contrast to some mecp <dig> mutation mouse models, the a140v mouse has an apparently normal lifespan and normal weight gain patterns with no obvious seizures, tremors, breathing difficulties or kyphosis.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified various neurological abnormalities in this mouse model of rett syndrome/x-linked mental retardation which may help to elucidate the manner in which mecp <dig> mutations cause neuronal changes resulting in mental retardation without the confounding effects of seizures, chronic hypoventilation, or other rett syndrome associated symptoms.
