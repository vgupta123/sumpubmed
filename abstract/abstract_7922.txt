BACKGROUND
determination of genetic relatedness among microorganisms provides information necessary for making inferences regarding phylogeny. however, there is little information available on how well the genetic relationships inferred from different genotyping methods agree with true genetic relationships. in this report, two genotyping methods – restriction fragment analysis  and partial genome dna sequencing – were each compared to complete dna sequencing as the definitive standard for classification.


RESULTS
using the genbank database,  <dig> different types or subtypes of papillomavirus were selected as study samples, because numerous complete genome sequences were available. rfa was achieved by computer-simulated digestion. the genetic similarity of samples, based on rfa, was determined from the proportion of fragments that matched in size. dna sequences of four specific genes , representing partial genome sequencing, were also selected for comparison to complete genome sequencing. laboratory error was not taken into account. evaluation of the correlation between genetic similarity matrices  and comparisons of the structure of the derived dendrograms  indicated that partial genome sequencing  had higher agreement with complete genome sequencing, achieving a maximum mantel's r =  <dig>  and a minimum partition metric =  <dig>  rfa had lower agreement, with a maximum mantel's r =  <dig>  and a minimum partition metric =  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this simulation indicated that for smaller genomes, such as papillomavirus, partial genome sequencing is superior to restriction fragment analysis in representing genetic relatedness among isolates. the generalizability of these results to larger genomes, as well as the impact of laboratory error, remains to be demonstrated.
