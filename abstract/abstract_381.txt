BACKGROUND
an ideal tumor vaccine should activate both effector and memory immune response against tumor-specific antigens. beside the cd8+ t cells that play a central role in the generation of a protective immune response and of long-term memory, dendritic cells  are important for the induction, coordination and regulation of the adaptive immune response. the dcs can conduct all of the elements of the immune orchestra and are therefore a fundamental target and tool for vaccination. the present study was aimed at assessing the ability of tumor vaccine composed of c-class cpg odns and irradiated melanoma tumor cells b16f <dig> followed by two additional injections of cpg odns to induce the generation of a functional long-term memory response in experimental tumor model in mice .


RESULTS
it has been shown that the functional memory response in vaccinated mice persists for at least  <dig> days after the last vaccination. repeated vaccination also improves the survival of experimental animals compared to single vaccination, whereas the proportion of animals totally protected from the development of aggressive i.p. b16f <dig> tumors after vaccination repeated three times varies between  <dig> %- <dig> %. additionally, the long-term immune memory and tumor protection is maintained over a prolonged period of time of at least  <dig> months. finally, it has been demonstrated that following the vaccination the tumor-specific memory cells predominantly reside in bone marrow and peritoneal tissue and are in a more active state than their splenic counterparts.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study we demonstrated that tumor vaccine composed of c-class cpg odns and irradiated tumor cells followed by two additional injections of cpg odns induces a long-term immunity against aggressive b16f <dig> tumors.
