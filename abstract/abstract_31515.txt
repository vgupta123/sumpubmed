BACKGROUND
although there have been considerable advances in the study of dengue virus, no vaccines or anti-dengue drugs are currently available for humans. therefore, new approaches are necessary for the development of potent anti-dengue drugs. natural antimicrobial peptides  with potent antiviral activities are potential hits-to-leads for antiviral drug discovery. we performed this study to identify and characterise the inhibitory potential of the latarcin peptide  against dengue virus replication in infected cells.


RESULTS
the ltc  <dig> peptide showed a significantly inhibitory effect against the dengue protease ns2b-ns3pro at 37°c, a physiological human temperature, , and greater inhibitory effect was observed at 40°c, a temperature similar to a high fever . a greater reduction in viral load  was observed at simultaneous  and post-treatment  compared to the pre-treatment . treatment with the ltc  <dig> peptide reduced the viral rna in a dose-dependent manner with ec <dig> values of  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm at  <dig>   <dig> and 72 h, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the ltc  <dig> peptide exhibited significant inhibitory effects against dengue ns2b-ns3pro and virus replication in the infected cells. therefore, further investigation is necessary to develop the ltc  <dig> peptide as a new anti-dengue therapeutic.
