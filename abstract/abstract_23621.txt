BACKGROUND
laccases are multi-copper oxidases that catalyze the one electron oxidation of a broad range of compounds. laccase substrates include substituted phenols, arylamines and aromatic thiols. such compounds are activated by the enzyme to the corresponding radicals. owing to their broad substrate range laccases are considered to be versatile biocatalysts which are capable of oxidizing natural and non-natural industrial compounds, with water as sole by-product.


RESULTS
a novel cota-type laccase from bacillus pumilus was cloned, expressed and purified and its biochemical characteristics are presented here. the molecular weight of the purified laccase was estimated to be  <dig> kda and the enzyme was found to be associated with four copper atoms. its catalytic activity towards  <dig> '-azino-bis ,  <dig> -dimethoxyphenol  and syringaldazine  was investigated. the kinetic parameters km and kcat for abts were  <dig> ±  <dig> μm and  <dig> ±  <dig>  s- <dig>  for  <dig> -dmp  <dig> ±  <dig> μm and  <dig> ±  <dig>  s- <dig> and for sgz only kcat could be estimated to be  <dig> ±  <dig>  s- <dig>  the ph optimum for abts was  <dig>  for  <dig> -dmp  <dig> and for sgz  <dig>  and temperature optima for abts and  <dig> -dmp were found to be around 70°c. the screening of  <dig> natural and non-natural compounds as substrates for b. pumilus laccase revealed  <dig> suitable compounds. three of them served as redox mediators in the laccase-catalyzed decolorization of the dye indigocarmine , thus assessing the new enzyme's biotechnological potential.


CONCLUSIONS
the fully copper loaded, thermostable cota laccase from bacillus pumilus is a versatile laccase with potential applications as an industrial biocatalyst.
