BACKGROUND
capsaicinoids, including capsaicin and its analogs, are responsible for the pungency of pepper  fruits. even though capsaicin is familiar and used daily by humans, the genes involved in the capsaicin biosynthesis pathway have not been well characterized. the putative aminotransferase  and pungent gene  <dig>  proteins are believed to catalyze the second to last and the last steps in the pathway, respectively, making the pun <dig> protein the putative capsaicin synthase. however, there is no direct evidence that pun <dig> has capsaicin synthase activity.


RESULTS
to verify that the pun <dig> protein actually plays a role in capsaicin production, we generated anti-pun <dig> antibodies against an escherichia coli-synthesized pun <dig> protein and used them to antagonize endogenous pun <dig> activity. to confirm the anti-pun <dig> antibodies’ specificity, we targeted pun <dig> mrna using virus-induced gene silencing. in the pun1-down-regulated placental tissues, the accumulated levels of the pun <dig> protein, which was identified on a western blot using the anti-pun <dig> antibodies, were reduced, and simultaneously, capsaicin accumulations were reduced in the same tissues. in the de novo capsaicin synthesis in vitro cell-free assay, which uses protoplasts isolated from placental tissues, capsaicin synthesis was inhibited by the addition of anti-pun <dig> antibodies. we next analyzed the expression profiles of pamt and pun <dig> in various pepper cultivars and found that high levels of capsaicin accumulation always accompanied high expression levels of both pamt and pun <dig>  indicating that both genes are important for capsaicin synthesis. however, comparisons of the accumulated levels of vanillylamine  and capsaicin between pungent and nonpungent cultivars revealed that vanillylamine levels in the pungent cultivars were very low, probably owing to its rapid conversion to capsaicin by pun <dig> soon after synthesis, and that in nonpungent cultivars, vanillylamine accumulated to quite high levels owing to the lack of pun <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
using a newly developed protoplast-based assay for de novo capsaicin synthesis and the anti-pun <dig> antibodies, we successfully demonstrated that the pun <dig> gene and its gene product are involved in capsaicin synthesis. the analysis of the vanillylamine accumulation relative to that of capsaicin indicated that pun <dig> was the primary determinant of their accumulation levels.
