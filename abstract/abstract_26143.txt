BACKGROUND
drug susceptible clinical isolates of candida albicans frequently become highly tolerant to drugs during chemotherapy, with dreadful consequences to patient health. we used rna sequencing  to analyze the transcriptomes of a cdr  strain and its isogenic drug sensitive counterpart.


RESULTS
rna-seq unveiled differential expression of  <dig> genes including a) genes previously identified as involved in cdr, b) genes not previously associated to the cdr phenotype, and c) novel transcripts whose function as a gene is uncharacterized. in particular, we show for the first time that cdr acquisition is correlated with an overexpression of the transcription factor encoding gene czf <dig>  czf <dig> null mutants were susceptible to many drugs, independently of known multidrug resistance mechanisms. we show that czf <dig> acts as a repressor of Î²-glucan synthesis, thus negatively regulating cell wall integrity. finally, our rna-seq data allowed us to identify a new transcribed region, upstream of the tac <dig> gene, which encodes the major cdr transcriptional regulator.


CONCLUSIONS
our results open new perspectives of the role of czf <dig> and of our understanding of the transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms that lead to the acquisition of drug resistance in c. albicans, with potential for future improvements of therapeutic strategies.
