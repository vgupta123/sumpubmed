BACKGROUND
phosphoinositides play a central role in regulating processes at intracellular membranes. in yeast, a large number of phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes use a common mechanism for transcriptional regulation. yet, how the expression of genes encoding lipid kinases and phosphatases is regulated remains unknown.


RESULTS
here we show that the expression of lipid phosphatase sac1p in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is regulated in response to changes in phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate p) concentrations. unlike genes encoding enzymes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis, expression of the sac <dig> gene is independent of inositol levels. we identified a novel 9-bp motif within the 5' untranslated region  of sac <dig> that is responsible for pip-mediated regulation. upregulation of sac <dig> promoter activity correlates with elevated levels of sac <dig> protein levels.


CONCLUSIONS
regulation of sac1p expression via the concentration of its major substrate pip ensures proper maintenance of compartment-specific pools of pip.
