BACKGROUND
nitric oxide  is a multifunctional molecule synthesized by three isozymes of the no synthase  acting as a messenger/modulator and/or a potential neurotoxin. in rodents, the role of noss in sleep processes and throughout aging is now well established. for example, sleep parameters are highly deteriorated in senescence accelerated-prone  <dig>  mice, a useful animal model to study aging or age-associated disorders, while the inducible form of nos  is down-regulated within the cortex and the sleep-structures of the brainstem. evidence is now increasing for a role of inos and resulting oxidative stress but not for the constitutive expressed isozyme . to better understand the role of nnos in the behavioural impairments observed in samp <dig> versus samr <dig>  animals, we evaluated age-related variations occurring in the nnos expression and activity and nitrites/nitrates  levels, in three brain areas . calibrated reverse transcriptase  and real-time polymerase chain reaction  and biochemical procedures were used.


RESULTS
we found that the levels of nnos mrna decreased in the cortex and the hippocampus of 8- vs 2-month-old animals followed by an increase in 12-vs 8-month-old animals in both strains. in the brainstem, levels of nnos mrna decreased in an age-dependent manner in samp <dig>  but not in samr <dig>  regional age-related changes were also observed in nnos activity. moreover, nnos activity in hippocampus was found lower in 8-month-old samp <dig> than in samr <dig>  while in the cortex and the brainstem, nnos activities increased at  <dig> months and afterward decreased with age in samp <dig> and samr <dig>  nox- levels showed profiles similar to nnos activities in the cortex and the brainstem but were undetectable in the hippocampus of samp <dig> and samr <dig>  finally, nox- levels were higher in the cortex of  <dig> month-old samp <dig> than in age-matched samr <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
concomitant variations occurring in no levels derived from nnos and inos at an early age constitute a major factor of risk for sleep and/or memory impairments in samp <dig>
