BACKGROUND
cell adhesion is an important regulator of cell growth and motility. recently the hepatocyte cell adhesion molecules  <dig> and  <dig> , members of the immunoglobulin family of adhesion genes, have been identified. hepacam <dig> is involved in negative cell cycle regulation via p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> signalling but also mediates increased human breast cancer cell spread. the role and expression pattern of hepacam <dig> has not been analyzed so far. in the present study we quantified gene expression levels of hepacam <dig> and  <dig> to evaluate their possible role during the carcinogenesis of canine mammary tumours.


RESULTS
adenomas displayed increased hepacam <dig> and  <dig> mrna expression levels and decreased hepacam <dig> protein expression levels when compared to normal gland, carcinomas and lymph node metastases. in contrast, metastatic carcinomas, intravascular tumour cells and lymph node metastases had hepacam  <dig> protein and mrna expression levels similar to normal gland but decreased hepacam <dig> mrna expression when compared to normal gland of the same dog.


CONCLUSIONS
hepacam <dig> and  <dig> seem to be important for cell-cell adhesion of normal and neoplastic canine mammary cells. the loss of hepacam <dig> protein expression in adenomas but not in carcinomas questions its role as a tumour suppressor at late stages of malignant transformation and indicates that it might rather be involved in physiologic mammary cell adhesion and canine mammary tumour metastasis. furthermore, it can be speculated, whether hepacam <dig> plays a different role in malignancy and metastasis of canine mammary tumours since its transcriptional levels are different in carcinomas and their lymph node metastases when compared to hepacam <dig>
