BACKGROUND
lactobacilli can utilize a variety of carbohydrates which reflects the nutrient availability in their respective environments. a common lactobacilli in the human gastrointestinal tract, lactobacillus gasseri, was selected for further study. the currently available annotation of the l. gasseri atcc  <dig> genome describes numerous putative genes involved in carbohydrate utilization, yet the specific functions of many of these genes remain unknown.


RESULTS
an enzyme i  knockout strain revealed that a functional phosphotransferase transporter system  is required to ferment at least  <dig> carbohydrates. analysis of the l. gasseri atcc  <dig> genome identified fifteen complete  pts transporters. transcript expression profiles in response to various carbohydrates  were analyzed for the fifteen complete pts transporters in l. gasseri. pts  <dig> was induced  <dig> fold in the presence of sucrose and pts  <dig> was induced  <dig> fold in the presence of cellobiose. no pts transporter was induced by glucose, fructose or mannose. insertional inactivation of pts  <dig> and pts  <dig> significantly impaired growth on cellobiose and sucrose, respectively. as predicted by bioinformatics, insertional inactivation of pts  <dig> confirmed its role in mannose utilization.


CONCLUSIONS
the experiments revealed the extensive contribution of pts transporters to carbohydrate utilization by l. gasseri atcc  <dig> and the general inadequacy of the annotated sugar specificity of lactobacilli pts transporters.
