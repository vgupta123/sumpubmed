BACKGROUND
articular cartilage  is the layer of tissue that covers the articulating ends of the bones in diarthrodial joints. adult ac is characterised by a depth-dependent composition and structure of the extracellular matrix that results in depth-dependent mechanical properties, important for the functions of adult ac. collagen is the most abundant solid component and it affects the mechanical behaviour of ac. the current objective is to quantify the postnatal development of depth-dependent collagen density in sheep  ac between birth and maturity. we use fourier transform infra-red micro-spectroscopy to investigate collagen density in  <dig> sheep divided over ten sample points between birth  and maturity . in each animal, we investigate six anatomical sites  in the distal metacarpus of a fore leg and a hind leg.


RESULTS
collagen density increases from birth to maturity up to our last sample point . collagen density increases at the articular surface from  <dig>  g/ml ±  <dig>  g/ml  at  <dig> weeks to  <dig>  g/ml ±  <dig>  g/ml  at  <dig> weeks. maximum collagen density in the deeper cartilage increases from  <dig>  g/ml ±  <dig>  g/ml  at  <dig> weeks to  <dig>  g/ml ±  <dig>  g/ml  at  <dig> weeks. most collagen density profiles at  <dig> weeks  show a valley, indicating a minimum, in collagen density near the articular surface. at  <dig> weeks, only 17% of the collagen density profiles show a valley in collagen density near the articular surface. the fraction of profiles with this valley stabilises at  <dig> weeks.


CONCLUSIONS
collagen density in articular cartilage increases in postnatal life with depth-dependent variation, and does not stabilize up to  <dig> weeks, the last sample point in our study. we find strong evidence for a valley in collagen densities near the articular surface that is present in the youngest animals, but that has disappeared in the oldest animals. we discuss that the retardance valley  in perinatal animals reflects a decrease in collagen density, as well as a decrease in collagen fibril anisotropy.
