BACKGROUND
rheumatoid arthritis  is an autoimmune disease with unknown etiology. anticitrullinated protein autoantibody has been documented as a highly specific autoantibody associated with ra. protein arginine deiminase type  <dig>  is the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the conversion of peptidylarginine into peptidylcitrulline. pad <dig> is a new therapeutic target for ra treatment. in order to search for inhibitors of pad <dig>  structure-based virtual screening was performed using lidaeus . potential inhibitors were screened experimentally by inhibition assays.


RESULTS
twenty two of the top-ranked water-soluble compounds were selected for inhibitory screening against pad <dig>  three compounds showed significant inhibition of pad <dig> and their ic <dig> values were investigated. the structures of the three compounds show no resemblance with previously discovered pad <dig> inhibitors, nor with existing drugs for ra treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
three compounds were discovered as potential inhibitors of pad <dig> by virtual screening. the compounds are commercially available and can be used as scaffolds to design more potent inhibitors against pad <dig>
