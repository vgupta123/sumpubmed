BACKGROUND
copy number variations  and dna sequence alterations affecting specific neuronal genes are established risk factors for autism spectrum disorder . in what is largely considered a genetic condition, so far, these mutations account for ~20% of individuals having an asd diagnosis. however, non-coding genomic sequence also contains functional elements introducing additional disease risk loci for investigation.


RESULTS
we have performed genome-wide analyses and identified rare inherited cnvs affecting non-genic intervals in  <dig> of  <dig>  of asd cases examined. examples of such intergenic cnv regions include 16q <dig> and 2p <dig>  near known asd risk genes cdh <dig> and nrxn <dig> respectively, as well as novel loci contiguous with zhx <dig>  mocs <dig>  lrrc4c, sema3c, and other genes.


CONCLUSIONS
rare variants in intergenic regions may implicate new risk loci and genes in asd and also present useful data for comparison with coming whole genome sequence datasets.
