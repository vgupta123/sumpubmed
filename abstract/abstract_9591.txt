BACKGROUND
emerging studies demonstrate that single nucleotide polymorphisms  resided in the microrna recognition element seed sites  in 3′utr of mrnas are putative biomarkers for human diseases and cancers. however, exhaustively experimental validation for the causality of mress snps is impractical. therefore bioinformatics have been introduced to predict causal mress snps. genome-wide association study  provides a way to detect susceptibility of millions of snps simultaneously by taking linkage disequilibrium  into account, but the multiple-testing corrections implemented to suppress false positive rate always sacrificed the sensitivity. in our study, we proposed a method to identify candidate causal mress snps from  <dig> gwas datasets without performing multiple-testing corrections. alternatively, we used biological context to ensure credibility of the selected snps.


RESULTS
in  <dig> out of the  <dig> gwas datasets, mress snps were over-represented in snps with p-value ≤  <dig>   ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> ). moreover, host genes of susceptible mress snps in each of the  <dig> gwas dataset shared biological context with reported causal genes. there were  <dig> mress snps identified by our method, while only  <dig> snps were identified by multiple-testing corrections with a given threshold of 1 × 10− <dig>  which is a common cutoff used in gwas.  <dig> out of the  <dig> candidate snps have been reported to be deleterious while only  <dig> out of  <dig> multiple-testing corrected snps were documented in pubmed. microrna-mrna interactions affected by the  <dig> candidate snps were likely to present negatively correlated expression. these snps introduced greater alternation of binding free energy than other mress snps, especially when grouping by haplotypes .


CONCLUSIONS
mress snps are promising disease biomarkers in multiple gwas datasets. the method of integrating gwas p-value and biological context is stable and effective for selecting candidate causal mress snps, it reduces the loss of sensitivity compared to multiple-testing corrections. the  <dig> candidate causal mress snps provide researchers a credible source to initialize their design of experimental validations in the future.
