BACKGROUND
cardiac rhythmic activity is initiated in functionally specialized areas of the heart. hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated  channels are fundamental for these processes of cardiac physiology.


RESULTS
here we investigated transcript and protein expression patterns of hcn channels in hl- <dig> cardiomyocytes using a combination of quantitative pcr analysis and immunocytochemistry. gene expression profiles of hcn <dig>  hcn <dig> and hcn <dig> were acutely affected during hl- <dig> cell propagation. in addition, distinct expression patterns were uncovered for hcn <dig>  hcn <dig> and hcn <dig> proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that hcn channel isoforms might be involved in the concerted differentiation of hl- <dig> cells and may indirectly affect the occurrence of contractile hl- <dig> cell activity. we expect that these findings will promote studies on other molecular markers that contribute to cardiac physiology.
