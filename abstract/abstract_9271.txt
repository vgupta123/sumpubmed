BACKGROUND
the ampelopsis clade  of the grape family vitaceae contains ca.  <dig> species disjunctly distributed in asia, europe, north america, south america, africa, and australia, and is a rare example to study both the northern and the southern hemisphere intercontinental disjunctions. we reconstruct the temporal and spatial diversification of the ampelopsis clade to explore the evolutionary processes that have resulted in their intercontinental disjunctions in six continents.


RESULTS
the bayesian molecular clock dating and the likelihood ancestral area analyses suggest that the ampelopsis clade most likely originated in north america with its crown group dated at  <dig>  ma  in the middle eocene. two independent laurasian migrations into eurasia are inferred to have occurred in the early miocene via the north atlantic land bridges. the ancestor of the southern hemisphere lineage migrated from north america to south america in the early oligocene. the gondwanan-like pattern of intercontinental disjunction is best explained by two long-distance dispersals: once from south america to africa estimated at  <dig>  ma , and the other from south america to australia dated to  <dig>  ma .


CONCLUSIONS
the global disjunctions in the ampelopsis clade are best explained by a diversification model of north american origin, two laurasian migrations, one migration into south america, and two post-gondwanan long-distance dispersals. these findings highlight the importance of both vicariance and long distance dispersal in shaping intercontinental disjunctions of flowering plants.
