BACKGROUND
recent in vitro evidence indicates that blockade of 5-hydroxytryptamine  receptor  <dig>  is able to confer protection in different models of neuronal injury. the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of tropisetron, a 5-ht <dig> receptor antagonist, on infarct size and neurological score in a model of ischemic stroke induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion  in the rat.

methods
two different doses of tropisetron  or vehicle were administered intraperitoneally  <dig> min before pmcao. neurological deficit scores, mortality rate and infarct volume were determined  <dig> h after permanent focal cerebral ischemia.


RESULTS
tropisetron failed to reduce cerebral infarction. animals receiving tropisetron showed a significant increase  in neurological deficits and mortality rate.


CONCLUSIONS
data from this study indicate that blockade of 5-ht <dig> receptors with tropisetron worsens ischemic brain injury induced by pmcao. these findings could have important clinical implications. patients taking tropisetron, and possibly other 5-ht <dig> antagonists, could potentially have a worse outcome following a brain infarct.
