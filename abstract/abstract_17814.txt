BACKGROUND
bi-parental mapping populations have been commonly utilized to identify and characterize quantitative trait loci  controlling resistance to soybean cyst nematode . although this approach successfully mapped a large number of scn resistance qtl, it captures only limited allelic diversity that exists in parental lines, and it also has limitations for genomic resolution. in this study, a genome-wide association study  was performed using a diverse set of  <dig> soybean plant introductions  belonging to maturity groups from iii to v to detect qtl/genes associated with scn resistance to hg type  <dig> 


RESULTS
over  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphism  markers generated by the soysnp50k iselect beadchip  were utilized for analysis. gwas identified  <dig> loci distributed over different chromosomes comprising  <dig> snps significantly associated with scn resistance. results also confirmed six qtl that were previously mapped using bi-parental populations, including the rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> loci. gwas identified eight novel qtl, including qtl on chromosome  <dig>  which we have previously mapped by using a bi-parental population. in addition to the known loci for four simple traits, such as seed coat color, flower color, pubescence color, and stem growth habit, two traits, like lodging and pod shattering, having moderately complex inheritance have been confirmed with great precision by gwas.


CONCLUSIONS
the study showed that gwas can be employed as an effective strategy for identifying complex traits in soybean and for narrowing gwas-defined genomic regions, which facilitates positional cloning of the causal gene.
