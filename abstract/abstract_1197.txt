BACKGROUND
transposable elements  are key components that shape the organization and evolution of genomes. fungi have developed defense mechanisms against te invasion such as rip , mip  and quelling . rip inactivates repeated sequences by promoting cytosine to thymine mutations, whereas mip only methylates tes at c residues. both mechanisms require specific cytosine dna methyltransferases  of the dnmt <dig> superfamily.


RESULTS
we annotated te sequences from  <dig> fungal genomes with different te content . we then used these te sequences to carry out a genome-wide analysis of c to t mutations biases. genomes from either ascomycota or basidiomycota that were massively invaded by tes  were characterized by a low frequency of c to t mutation bias , whereas other genomes displayed intermediate to high frequencies . we identified several dinucleotide signatures at these c to t mutation sites . phylogenomic analysis of fungal dnmt <dig> mtases revealed a previously unreported association between these dinucleotide signatures and the presence/absence of sub-classes of dnmt <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we identified fungal genomes containing large numbers of tes with many c to t mutations associated with species-specific dinucleotide signatures. this bias suggests that a basic defense mechanism against te invasion similar to rip is widespread in fungi, although the efficiency and specificity of this mechanism differs between species. our analysis revealed that dinucleotide signatures are associated with the presence/absence of specific dnmt <dig> subfamilies. in particular, an rid1-dependent rip mechanism was found only in ascomycota.
