BACKGROUND
many different sexual isolation and sexual selection statistics have been proposed in the past. however, there is no available software that implements all these statistical estimators and their corresponding tests for the study of mating behaviour.


RESULTS
jmating is an easy-to-use program developed in java for the analysis of mating frequency data to study sexual selection and sexual isolation effects from laboratory experiments as well as descriptive studies accomplished in the wild. the software allows the re-organization of the data previous to the analysis, the estimation of the most important estimators, and a battery of complementary statistical tests.


CONCLUSIONS
jmating is the first complete and versatile software for the analyses of mating frequency data. it is available at  and requires the java runtime environment.
