BACKGROUND
discovering functional relationships of genes through cell-based phenotyping has become an important approach in functional genomics. high-throughput imaging offers the ability to quantitatively assess complex phenotypes after perturbation by rna interference . such image-based high-throughput rnai screening studies have facilitated the discovery of novel components of gene networks and their interactions. images generated by automated microscopy are typically analyzed by extracting quantitative features of individual cells, resulting in large multidimensional data sets. robust and sensitive methods to interpret these data sets and to derive biologically relevant information in a high-throughput and unbiased manner remain to be developed.


RESULTS
here we propose a new analysis method, phenodissim, which computes the phenotypic dissimilarity between cell populations via support vector machine classification and cross validation. applying this method to a kinome rnai screening data set, we demonstrate that the proposed method shows a good replicate reproducibility, separation of controls and clustering quality, and we are able to identify sirna phenotypes and discover potential functional links between genes.


CONCLUSIONS
phenodissim is a novel analysis method for image-based high-throughput screen, relying on two parameters which can be automatically optimized without a priori knowledge. phenodissim is freely available as an r package.
