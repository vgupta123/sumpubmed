BACKGROUND
common, complex diseases are hypothesized to result from a combination of common and rare genetic variants. we developed a unified framework for the joint association testing of both types of variants. within the framework, we developed a union-intersection test suitable for genome-wide analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms , candidate gene data, as well as medical sequencing data. the union-intersection test is a composite test of association of genotype frequencies and differential correlation among markers.


RESULTS
we demonstrated by computer simulation that the false positive error rate was controlled at the expected level. we also demonstrated scenarios in which the multi-locus test was more powerful than traditional single marker analysis. to illustrate use of the union-intersection test with real data, we analyzed a publically available data set of  <dig>  autosomal snps genotyped for  <dig> cases of parkinson disease and  <dig> neurologically normal controls for which no genome-wide significant results were found by traditional single marker analysis. we also analyzed an independent follow-up sample of  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls for replication.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified a single risk haplotype with a directionally consistent effect in both samples in the gene gak, which is involved in clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking. we also found suggestive evidence that directionally inconsistent marginal effects from single marker analysis appeared to result from risk being driven by different haplotypes in the two samples for the genes syn <dig> and ngly <dig>  which are involved in neurotransmitter release and proteasomal degradation, respectively. these results illustrate the utility of our unified framework for genome-wide association analysis of common, complex diseases.
