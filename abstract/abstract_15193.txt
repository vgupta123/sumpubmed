BACKGROUND
aptamers are nucleic acids selected for their ability to bind to molecules of interest and may provide the basis for a whole new class of medicines. if the aptamer is simply a dsdna molecule with a ssdna overhang  then the segment of ssdna that complements that overhang provides a known binding target with binding strength adjustable according to length of overhang.


RESULTS
two bifunctional aptamers are examined using a nanopore detector. they are chosen to provide sensitive, highly modulated, blockade signals with their captured ends, while their un-captured regions are designed to have binding moieties for complementary ssdna targets. the bifunctional aptamers are duplex dna on their channel-captured portion, and single-stranded dna on their portion with binding ability. for short ssdna, the binding is merely to the complementary strand of dna, which is what is studied here – for 5-base and 6-base overhangs.


CONCLUSIONS
a preliminary statistical analysis using hidden markov models  indicates a clear change in the blockade pattern upon binding by the single captured aptamer. this is also consistent with the hypothesis that significant conformational changes occur during the annealing binding event. in further work the objective is to simply extend this ssdna portion to be a well-studied ~ <dig> base ssdna aptamer, joined to the same bifunctional aptamer molecular platform.
