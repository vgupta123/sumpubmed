BACKGROUND
marek's disease  is a t-cell lymphoma of chickens caused by the marek's disease virus , an oncogenic avian herpesvirus. md is a major cause of economic loss to the poultry industry and the most serious and persistent infectious disease concern. a full-sib intercross population, consisting of five independent families was generated by crossing and repeated intercrossing of two partially inbred commercial white leghorn layer lines known to differ in genetic resistance to md. at the f <dig> generation, a total of  <dig> chicks were produced  and phenotyped for md resistance measured as survival time in days after challenge with a very virulent plus  strain of mdv.


RESULTS
qtl affecting md resistance were identified by selective dna pooling using a panel of  <dig> snps and  <dig> microsatellite markers. since mhc blood type  is known to affect md resistance, a total of  <dig> independent pool pairs were constructed according to family Ã— bt combination, with some combinations represented twice for technical reasons. twenty-one qtl regions  affecting post-challenge survival time were identified, distributed among  <dig> chromosomes , with about two-thirds of the md resistance alleles derived from the more md resistant parental line. eight of the qtlr associated with md resistance, were previously identified in a backcross  mapping study with the same parental lines. of these,  <dig> originated from the more resistant line, and one from the less resistant line.


CONCLUSIONS
there was considerable evidence suggesting that md resistance alleles tend to be recessive. the width of the qtlr for these qtl appeared to be reduced about two-fold in the f <dig> as compared to that found in the previous bc study. these results provide a firm basis for high-resolution linkage disequilibrium mapping and positional cloning of the resistance genes.
