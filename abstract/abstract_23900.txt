BACKGROUND
understanding genetic determinants of a microbial phenotype generally involves creating and comparing isogenic strains differing at the locus of interest, but the naturally existing genomic and phenotypic diversity of microbial populations has rarely been exploited. here we report use of a diverse collection of  <dig> carriage isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae and their genome sequences to help identify a novel determinant of pneumococcal colonization.


RESULTS
a spontaneously arising laboratory variant  of a capsule-switched tigr <dig> strain  showed reduced ability to establish mouse nasal colonization and lower resistance to non-opsonic neutrophil-mediated killing in vitro, a phenotype correlated with in vivo success. whole genome sequencing revealed  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  affecting  <dig> genes in spnyl <dig> relative to its ancestor. to evaluate the effect of variation in each gene, we performed an in silico screen of  <dig> previously published genome sequences to identify pairs of closely-related, serotype-matched isolates that differ at the gene of interest, and compared their resistance to neutrophil-killing. this method allowed rapid examination of multiple candidate genes and found phenotypic differences apparently associated with variation in sp_ <dig>  a rela/ spot homolog  involved in the stringent response. to establish causality, the alleles corresponding to sp_ <dig> were switched between the tigr4:19f and spnyl <dig>  the wild-type sp_ <dig> conferred higher resistance to neutrophil-killing and competitiveness in mouse colonization. using a similar strategy, variation in another rsh gene  was found to alter resistance to neutrophil-killing.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that analysis of naturally existing genomic diversity complements traditional genetics approaches to accelerate genotype-phenotype analysis.
