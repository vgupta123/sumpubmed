BACKGROUND
environmental factors such as pesticides can cause phenotypic changes in various organisms, including mammals. we studied the effects of the widely used herbicide atrazine  on meiosis, a key step of gametogenesis, in male mice.

methods
gene expression pattern was analysed by gene–chip array. genome-wide mapping of h3k4me <dig> marks distribution was done by chip-sequencing of testis tissue using illumina technologies. rt-qpcr was used to validate differentially expressed genes or differential peaks.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that exposure to atz reduces testosterone levels and the number of spermatozoa in the epididymis and delays meiosis. using gene-chip and chip-seq analysis of h3k4me <dig> marks, we found that a broad range of cellular functions, including gtpase activity, mitochondrial function and steroid-hormone metabolism, are affected by atz. furthermore, treated mice display enriched histone h3k4me <dig> marks in regions of strong recombination , within very large genes and reduced marks in the pseudoautosomal region of x chromosome.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate that atrazine exposure interferes with normal meiosis, which affects spermatozoa production.
