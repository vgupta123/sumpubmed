BACKGROUND
evidence based on genomic sequences is urgently needed to confirm the phylogenetic relationship between mesorhizobium strain maff <dig> and m. huakuii. to define underlying causes for the rather striking difference in host specificity between m. huakuii strain 7653r and maff <dig>  several probable determinants also require comparison at the genomic level. an improved understanding of mobile genetic elements that can be integrated into the main chromosomes of mesorhizobium to form genomic islands would enrich our knowledge of how genome dynamics may contribute to mesorhizobium evolution in general.


RESULTS
in this study, we sequenced the complete genome of 7653r and compared it with five other mesorhizobium genomes. genomes of 7653r and maff <dig> were found to share a large set of orthologs and, most importantly, a conserved chromosomal backbone and even larger perfectly conserved synteny blocks. we also identified candidate molecular differences responsible for the different host specificities of these two strains. finally, we reconstructed an ancestral mesorhizobium genomic island that has evolved into diverse forms in different mesorhizobium species.


CONCLUSIONS
our ortholog and synteny analyses firmly establish maff <dig> as a strain of m. huakuii. differences in nodulation factors and secretion systems t3ss, t4ss, and t6ss may be responsible for the unique host specificities of 7653r and maff <dig> strains. the plasmids of 7653r may have arisen by excision of the original genomic island from the 7653r chromosome.
