BACKGROUND
spls, a family of transcription factors specific to plants, play vital roles in plant growth and development through regulation of various physiological and biochemical processes. although populus trichocarpa is a model forest tree, the ptspl gene family has not been systematically studied.


RESULTS
here we report the identification of  <dig> full-length ptspls, which distribute on  <dig> p. trichocarpa chromosomes. based on the phylogenetic relationships of spls in p. trichocarpa and arabidopsis, plant spls can be classified into  <dig> groups. each group contains at least a ptspl and an atspl. the n-terminal zinc finger  <dig>  of sbp domain in group  <dig> spls has four cysteine residues , while zn <dig> of spls in the other groups mainly contains three cysteine and one histidine residues . comparative analyses of gene structures, conserved motifs and expression patterns of ptspls and atspls revealed the conservation of plant spls within a group, whereas among groups, the p. trichocarpa and arabidopsis spls were significantly different. various conserved motifs were identified in ptspls but not found in atspls, suggesting the diversity of plant spls. a total of  <dig> pairs of intrachromosome-duplicated ptspls were identified, suggesting the importance of gene duplication in spl gene expansion in p. trichocarpa. in addition,  <dig> of the  <dig> ptspls, belonging to g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig>  were found to be targets of mir <dig>  consistently, all of the atspls in these groups are regulated by mir <dig>  it suggests the conservation of mir156-mediated posttranscriptional regulation in plants.


CONCLUSIONS
a total of  <dig> full-length spls were identified from the whole genome sequence of p. trichocarpa. through comprehensive analyses of gene structures, phylogenetic relationships, chromosomal locations, conserved motifs, expression patterns and mir156-mediated posttranscriptional regulation, the ptspl gene family was characterized. our results provide useful information for evolution and biological function of plant spls.
