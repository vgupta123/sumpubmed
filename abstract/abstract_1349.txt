BACKGROUND
prox <dig>  the vertebrate homolog of prospero in drosophila melanogaster, is a divergent homeogene that regulates cell proliferation, fate determination and differentiation during vertebrate embryonic development.


RESULTS
here we report that, in zebrafish, prox <dig> is widely expressed in several districts of the central nervous system . specifically, we evidenced prox <dig> expression in a group of neurons, already positive for otp <dig>  located in the hypothalamus at the level of the posterior tuberculum . prox <dig> knock-down determines the severe loss of hypothalamic catecholaminergic  neurons, identified by tyrosine hydroxylase  expression, and the synergistic prox1/otp <dig> overexpression induces the appearance of hypothalamic supernumerary th-positive neurons and ectopic th-positive cells on the yolk epitelium.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate that prox <dig> activity is crucial for the proper development of the otp1-positive hypothalamic neuronal precursors to their terminal ca phenotype.
