BACKGROUND
the control of the subcellular localization of cell cycle regulators has emerged as a crucial mechanism in cell division regulation. the active transport of proteins between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is mediated by the transport receptors of the β-karyopherin family. in this work we characterized the terminal phenotype of a mutant strain in β-karyopherin kap <dig>  a component of the classical nuclear import pathway.


RESULTS
when kap <dig> was inactivated, most cells arrested at the g2/m phase of the cell cycle, which is in agreement with the results observed in mutants in the other components of this pathway. however, a number of cells accumulate at g <dig>  suggesting a novel role of kap <dig> and the classical import pathway at start. we investigated the localization of start transcription factors. it is known that swi <dig> contains a classical nls that interacts with importin α. here we show that the in vivo nuclear import of swi <dig> depends on kap <dig>  for swi <dig>  we identified a functional nls between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> that is sufficient and necessary for swi <dig> to enter the nucleus. the nuclear import driven by this nls is mediated by karyopherins kap <dig> and srp <dig>  inactivation of kap <dig> also produces a dramatic change in the localization of mbp <dig> since the protein is mainly detected in the cytoplasm. two functionally redundant kap95- and srp1-dependent nlss were identified in mbp <dig> between amino acids 27- <dig> and 166- <dig>  nuclear accumulation was not completely abolished in a kap <dig> mutant or in the mbp <dig> mutated in the two nlss, suggesting that alternative pathways might contribute to the mbp <dig> nuclear import to a lesser extent.


CONCLUSIONS
kap <dig> plays an essential role at the initiation of the cell cycle by driving the nuclear import of swi <dig>  swi <dig> and mbp <dig>  the three transcription factors responsible for the gene expression at start. this transport depends on the specific nuclear localization signals present in cargo proteins.
