BACKGROUND
ribonuclease  <dig> is a member of the rnase a family of secretory ribonucleases; orthologs of this gene have been found only in primate genomes. rnase  <dig> is a divergent paralog of rnase  <dig>  which is lysine-enriched, highly conserved, has prominent antimicrobial activity, and is expressed in both normal and diseased skin; in contrast, the physiologic function of rnase  <dig> remains uncertain. here, we examine the genetic diversity of human rnase  <dig>  a subject of significant interest given the existence of functional pseudogenes  in non-human primate genomes.


RESULTS
rnase  <dig> expression was detected in adult human lung, spleen and testis tissue by quantitative reverse-transcription pcr. only two single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four unique alleles were identified within the rnase  <dig> coding sequence; nucleotide sequence diversity  was unremarkable for a human nuclear gene. we isolated transcripts encoding rnase  <dig> via rapid amplification of cdna ends  and rt-pcr which included a distal potential translational start site followed by sequence encoding an additional  <dig> amino acids that are conserved in the genomes of several higher primates. the distal translational start site is functional and promotes rnase  <dig> synthesis in transfected cos- <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that rnase  <dig> may diverge considerably from typical rnase a family ribonucleases and may likewise exhibit unique function. this finding prompts a reconsideration of what we have previously termed functional pseudogenes, as rnase  <dig> may be responding to constraints that promote significant functional divergence from the canonical structure and enzymatic activity characteristic of the rnase a family.
