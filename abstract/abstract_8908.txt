BACKGROUND
interaction with the surrounding mesenchyme is necessary for development of endodermal organs, and fibroblast growth factors have recently emerged as mesenchymal-expressed morphogens that direct endodermal morphogenesis. the fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  null mouse is characterized by the absence of lung bud development. previous studies have shown that this requirement for fgf <dig> is due in part to its role as a chemotactic factor during branching morphogenesis. in other endodermal organs fgf <dig> also plays a role in regulating differentiation.


RESULTS
through gain-of-function analysis, we here find that fgf <dig> inhibits differentiation of the lung epithelium and promotes distalization of the embryonic lung. ectopic expression of fgf <dig> in the lung epithelium caused impaired lung development and perinatal lethality in a transgenic mouse model. lung lobes were enlarged due to increased interlobular distance and hyperplasia of the airway epithelium. differentiation of bronchial and alveolar cell lineages was inhibited. the transgenic epithelium consisted predominantly of proliferating progenitor-like cells expressing pro-surfactant protein c, ttf <dig>  pea <dig> and clusterin similarly to immature distal tip cells. strikingly, goblet cells developed within this arrested epithelium leading to goblet cell hyperplasia.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that fgf <dig> inhibits terminal differentiation in the embryonic lung and maintains the distal epithelium, and that excessive levels of fgf <dig> leads to metaplastic differentiation of goblet cells similar to that seen in chronic inflammatory diseases.
