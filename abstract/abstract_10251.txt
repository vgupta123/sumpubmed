BACKGROUND
the tissue distributions and functions of eph receptors and their ephrin ligands have been well studied, however less is known about their evolutionary history. we have undertaken a phylogenetic analysis of eph receptors and ephrins from a number of invertebrate and vertebrate species.


RESULTS
our findings indicate that eph receptors form three major clades: one comprised of non-chordate and cephalochordate eph receptors, a second comprised of urochordate eph receptors, and a third comprised of vertebrate eph receptors. ephrins, on the other hand, fall into either a clade made up of the non-chordate and cephalochordate ephrins plus the urochordate and vertebrate ephrin-bs or a clade made up of the urochordate and vertebrate ephrin-as.


CONCLUSIONS
we have concluded that eph receptors and ephrins diverged into a and b-types at different points in their evolutionary history, such that primitive chordates likely possessed an ancestral ephrin-a and an ancestral ephrin-b, but only a single eph receptor. furthermore, ephrin-as appear to have arisen in the common ancestor of urochordates and vertebrates, whereas ephrin-bs have a more ancient bilaterian origin. ancestral ephrin-b-like ligands had transmembrane domains; as gpi anchors appear to have arisen or been lost at least  <dig> times.
