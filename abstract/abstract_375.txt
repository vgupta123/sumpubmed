BACKGROUND
in an intercross between the swr/j and balb/c mouse strains, the pulmonary adenoma progression  <dig>  locus on chromosome  <dig> modulates lung tumor size, one of several measures of lung tumor progression. this locus has not been fully characterized and defined in its extent and genetic content. fine mapping of this and other loci affecting lung tumor phenotype is possible using recombinant inbred strains.


RESULTS
a population of  <dig> mice, obtained by crossing mice of the swr/j strain with cxbn recombinant inbred mice, was treated with a single dose of urethane and assayed for multiplicity of large lung tumors . a genome-wide analysis comparing n2lung with  <dig> autosomal snps revealed multiple peaks of association. the papg <dig> locus had two peaks, at rs <dig>  and rs <dig> , joined by an interval of weaker statistical association; these data confirm the presence of papg <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and reduce the mapping region to two stretches of ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig>  mb, in the proximal and distal peaks, respectively. the distal peak included cdkn2a, a gene already proposed as being involved in papg <dig> function. other loci possibly modulating n2lung were detected on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  but analysis for linkage disequilibrium of these putative loci with papg <dig> locus suggested that only those on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> were true positives.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that papg <dig> consists, most likely, of two distinct, nearby loci, and point to putative additional loci on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> modulating lung tumor size. within papg <dig>  cdkn2a appears to be a strong candidate gene while additional papg <dig> genes await to be identified. greater knowledge of the genetic and biochemical mechanisms underlying the germ-line modulation of lung tumor size in mice is relevant to other species, including humans, in that it may help identify new therapeutic targets in the fight against tumor progression.
