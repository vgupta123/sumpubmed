BACKGROUND
grapevine phylloxera, an insect related to true aphids, is a major historic pest of viticulture only controlled through the selection of resistant rootstocks or through quarantine regulations where grapevine is cultivated own-rooted. transcriptomic data could help understand the bases of its original life-traits, including a striking case of polyphenism, with forms feeding on roots and forms feeding in leaf-galls. comparisons with true aphids  should also allow to link differences in life-traits of the two groups with changes in gene repertoires or shifts in patterns of expression.


RESULTS
we sequenced transcriptomes of the grapevine phylloxera , choosing three life-stages  to cover a large catalogue of transcripts, and performed a de novo assembly. this resulted in  <dig>  contigs, which were annotated: most contigs had a best blastx hit to the pea aphid , while very few bacterial hits were recorded . coding sequences were predicted from this data set , revealing an extremely high at-bias . differential expression  analysis among root-feeding and gall-feeding showed that i) the root-feeding form displayed a much larger number of differentially expressed transcripts ii) root-feeding biased genes were enriched in some categories, for example cuticular proteins and genes associated with cell-cell signaling iii) leaf-galling-biased genes were enriched in genes associated with the nucleus and dna-replication, suggesting a metabolism more oriented towards fast and active multiplication. we also identified a gene family with a very high expression level  in the grapevine phylloxera , but usually expressed at very low levels in true aphids . these transcripts thus appear to be associated with oviparity.


CONCLUSIONS
our study illustrated major intraspecific changes in transcriptome profiles, related with different life-styles . at a different scale, we could also illustrate one major shift in expression levels associated with changes in life-traits that occurred along evolution and that respectively characterize  grapevine phylloxera and  true aphids.
