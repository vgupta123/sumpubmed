BACKGROUND
bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems usually comprise of a pair of genes encoding a stable toxin and its cognate labile antitoxin and are located in the chromosome or in plasmids of several bacterial species. chromosomally-encoded toxin-antitoxin systems are involved in bacterial stress responses and activation of the toxins usually leads to cell death or dormancy. overexpression of the chromosomally-encoded yoeb toxin from the yefm-yoeb toxin-antitoxin locus of the gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae has been shown to cause cell death in s. pneumoniae as well as e. coli.


RESULTS
induction of a yoeb-gfp fusion protein using a 17-β-estradiol-inducible plant expression system in arabidopsis thaliana col  <dig>  was lethal in all t <dig> progeny. examination of plants by fluorescent confocal microscopy showed gfp fluorescence in all parts of the leaves at  <dig> hours after 17-β-estradiol induction, continuing up to plant death. quantitative rt-pcr analysis revealed that the expression of the yoeb toxin gene peaked at  <dig> days after induction with 17-β-estradiol, coinciding with the onset of visible effects on the plants. moreover, we detected dna laddering in the transgenic plants at  <dig> hours after yoeb induction, indicative of apoptosis.


CONCLUSIONS
expression of the yoeb toxin from streptococcus pneumoniae is lethal in arabidopsis. we believe this is the first report of a toxin from a bacterial toxin-antitoxin system functioning in plants. the results presented here mark an important milestone towards the development of a cell ablation based bio-containment strategy, which may be useful for functional studies and for the control of spread of transgenic plants.
