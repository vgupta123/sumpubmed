BACKGROUND
superoxide dismutases  are a key antioxidant enzyme family, which have been implicated in protecting plants against the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species. despite current studies have shown that the gene family are involved in plant growth and developmental processes and biotic and abiotic stress responses, little is known about its functional role in upland cotton.


RESULTS
in the present study, we comprehensively analyzed the characteristics of the sod gene family in upland cotton . based on their conserved motifs,  <dig> ghsod genes were identified and phylogenetically classified into five subgroups which corroborated their classifications based on gene-structure patterns and subcellular localizations. the ghsod sequences were distributed at different densities across  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes. the conserved domains, gene family evolution cis-acting elements of promoter regions and mirna-mediated posttranscriptional regulation were predicted and analyzed. in addition, the expression pattern of  <dig> ghsod genes were tested in different tissues/organs and developmental stages, and different abiotic stresses and abscisic acid, which indicated that the sod gene family possessed temporal and spatial specificity expression specificity and may play important roles in reactive oxygen species scavenging caused by various stresses in upland cotton.


CONCLUSIONS
this study describes the first genome-wide analysis of the upland cotton sod gene family, and the results will help establish a foundation for the further cloning and functional verification of the ghsod gene family during stress responses, leading to crop improvement.
