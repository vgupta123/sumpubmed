BACKGROUND
interferon inducible transmembrane  proteins are effectors of the immune system widely characterized for their role in restricting infection by diverse enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. the chicken ifitm  genes are clustered on chromosome  <dig> and to date four genes have been annotated, namely chifitm <dig>  chifitm <dig>  chifitm <dig> and chifitm <dig>  however, due to poor assembly of this locus in the gallus gallus v4 genome, accurate characterization has so far proven problematic. recently, a new chicken reference genome assembly gallus gallus v <dig> was generated using sanger,  <dig>  illumina and pacbio sequencing technologies identifying considerable differences in the chifitm locus over the previous genome releases.

methods
we re-sequenced the locus using both illumina miseq and pacbio rs ii sequencing technologies and we mapped rna-seq data from the european nucleotide archive  to this finalized chifitm locus. using sureselect probes capture probes designed to the finalized chifitm locus, we sequenced the locus of a different chicken breed, namely a white leghorn, and a turkey.


RESULTS
we confirmed the gallus gallus v <dig> consensus except for two insertions of  <dig> and  <dig> base pair within the chifitm <dig> and b4galnt <dig> genes, respectively, and a single base pair deletion within the b4galnt <dig> gene. the pull down revealed a single amino acid substitution of a63v in the cil domain of ifitm <dig> compared to red jungle fowl and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> differences between ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of chickens and turkeys, respectively. rna-seq shows chifitm <dig> and chifitm <dig> expression in numerous tissue types of different chicken breeds and avian cell lines, while the expression of the putative chifitm <dig> is limited to the testis, caecum and ileum tissues.


CONCLUSIONS
locus resequencing using these capture probes and rna-seq based expression analysis will allow the further characterization of genetic diversity within galliformes.
