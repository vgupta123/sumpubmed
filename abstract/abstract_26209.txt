BACKGROUND
many studies of cocaine-responsive gene expression have focused on changes occurring during cocaine exposure, but few studies have examined the persistence of these changes with cocaine abstinence. persistent changes in gene expression, as well as alterations induced during abstinence may underlie long-lasting drug craving and relapse liability.


RESULTS
whole-genome expression analysis was conducted on a rat cocaine binge-abstinence model that has previously been demonstrated to engender increased drug seeking and taking with abstinence. gene expression changes in two mesolimbic terminal fields  were identified in a comparison of cocaine-na√Øve rats with rats after  <dig> days of cocaine self-administration followed by  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> days of enforced abstinence . a total of  <dig>  genes in the mpfc and  <dig> genes in the nac were altered between at least two time points . these genes can be subdivided into: 1) changes with cocaine self-administration that do not persist into periods of abstinence, 2) changes with cocaine self-administration that persist with abstinence, 3) and those not changed with cocaine self-administration, but changed during enforced abstinence. qpcr analysis was conducted to confirm gene expression changes observed in the microarray analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
together, these changes help to illuminate processes and networks involved in abstinence-induced behaviors, including synaptic plasticity, mapk signaling, and tnf signaling.
