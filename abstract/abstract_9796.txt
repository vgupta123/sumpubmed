BACKGROUND
the creation of a complete genome-wide map of transcription factor binding sites is essential for understanding gene regulatory networks in vivo. however, current prediction methods generally rely on statistical models that imperfectly model transcription factor binding. generation of new prediction methods that are based on protein binding data, but do not rely on these models may improve prediction sensitivity and specificity.


RESULTS
we propose a method for predicting transcription factor binding sites in the genome by directly mapping data generated from protein binding microarrays  to the genome and calculating a moving average of several overlapping octamers. using this unique algorithm, we predicted binding sites for the essential pancreatic islet transcription factor nkx <dig>  in the mouse genome and confirmed >90% of the tested sites by emsa and chip. scores generated from this method more accurately predicted relative binding affinity than pwm based methods. we have also identified an alternative core sequence recognized by the nkx <dig>  homeodomain. furthermore, we have shown that this method correctly identified binding sites in the promoters of two critical pancreatic islet β-cell genes, neurod <dig> and insulin <dig>  that were not predicted by traditional methods. finally, we show evidence that the algorithm can also be applied to predict binding sites for the nuclear receptor hnf4α.


CONCLUSIONS
pbm-mapping is an accurate method for predicting nkx <dig>  binding sites and may be widely applicable for the creation of genome-wide maps of transcription factor binding sites.
