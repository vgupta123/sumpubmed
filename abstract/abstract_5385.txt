BACKGROUND
tfiid is a multiprotein complex that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of rna polymerase ii  transcription owing to its core promoter recognition and co-activator functions. taf <dig> is a core tfiid subunit whose splice variants include the major taf6α isoform that is ubiquitously expressed, and the inducible taf6δ. in contrast to taf6α, taf6δ is a pro-apoptotic isoform with a  <dig> amino acid deletion in its histone fold domain that abolishes its interaction with taf <dig>  taf6δ expression can dictate life versus death decisions of human cells.


RESULTS
here we define the impact of endogenous taf6δ expression on the global transcriptome landscape. taf6δ was found to orchestrate a transcription profile that included statistically significant enrichment of genes of apoptotic function. interestingly, gene expression patterns controlled by taf6δ share similarities with, but are not equivalent to, those reported to change following taf <dig> and/or taf9b depletion. finally, because taf6δ regulates certain p <dig> target genes, we tested and demonstrated a physical and functional interaction between taf6δ and p <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
together our data define a taf6δ-driven apoptotic gene expression program and show crosstalk between the p <dig> and taf6δ pathways.
