BACKGROUND
miniature inverted repeat transposable element  is one type of transposable element , which is largely found in eukaryotic genomes and involved in a wide variety of biological events. however, only few mites were proved to be currently active and their physiological function remains largely unknown.


RESULTS
we found that the amplicon discrepancy of a gene locus loc_os01g <dig> in different rice cultivar genomes was resulted from the existence of a member of gaijin-like mites . this result indicated that mging transposition was occurred at this gene locus. by using a modified transposon display  analysis, the active transpositions of mging were detected in rice jiahua no.  <dig> genome under three conditions: in seedlings germinated from the seeds received a high dose γ-ray irradiation, in plantlets regenerated from anther-derived calli and from scutellum-derived calli, and were confirmed by pcr validation and sequencing. sequence analysis revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms  or short additional dna sequences at transposition sites post mging transposition. it suggested that sequence modification was possibly taken place during mging transposition. furthermore, cell re-differentiation experiment showed that active transpositions of both mging and mping  were identified only in regenerated plantlets.


CONCLUSIONS
it is for the first time that mging active transposition was demonstrated under γ-ray irradiation or in cell re-differentiation process in rice. this newly identified active mite will provide a foundation for further analysis of the roles of mites in biological process.
