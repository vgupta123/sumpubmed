BACKGROUND
proanthocyanidin is a polyphenolic bioflavonoid with known antioxidant activity. some flavonoids have a modulatory effect on i. although proanthocyanidin extract from blueberries reportedly affects ca2+ buffering capacity, there are no reports on the effects of proanthocyanidin on glutamate-induced i or cell death. in the present study, the effects of grape seed proanthocyanidin extract  on glutamate-induced excitotoxicity was investigated through calcium signals and nitric oxide  in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.


RESULTS
pretreatment with gspe  for  <dig> min inhibited the i increase normally induced by treatment with glutamate  for  <dig> min, in a concentration-dependent manner. pretreatment with gspe  for  <dig> min significantly decreased the i increase normally induced by two ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists, n-methyl-d-aspartate and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid . gspe further decreased ampa-induced response in the presence of  <dig> Î¼m nimodipine. however, gspe did not affect the  <dig> mm k+-induced increase in i. gspe significantly decreased the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist - <dig> -dihydroxyphenylglycine-induced increase in i, but it did not affect caffeine-induced response. gspe  significantly inhibited synaptically induced i spikes by  <dig>  mm o. in addition, pretreatment with gspe  for  <dig> min inhibited  <dig>  mm o- and glutamate-induced formation of no. treatment with gspe  significantly inhibited  <dig>  mm o- and oxygen glucose deprivation-induced neuronal cell death.


CONCLUSIONS
all these data suggest that gspe inhibits  <dig>  mm o- and oxygen glucose deprivation-induced neurotoxicity through inhibition of calcium signals and no formation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.
