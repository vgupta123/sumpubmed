BACKGROUND
the wnt signaling pathway is a cellular communication pathway that plays critical roles in development and disease. a major class of wnt signaling regulators is the dickkopf  family of secreted glycoproteins. although the biological properties of dickkopf  <dig>  and dickkopf  <dig>  are well characterized, little is known about the function of the related dickkopf  <dig>  protein in vivo or in cell lines. we recently demonstrated that dkk <dig> transcripts are upregulated during photoreceptor death in a mouse model of retinal degeneration. in this study, we characterized the activity of dkk <dig> in wnt signaling and cell death.


RESULTS
dkk <dig> was localized to müller glia and retinal ganglion cells in developing and adult mouse retina. western blotting confirmed that dkk <dig> is secreted from müller glia cells in culture. we demonstrated that dkk <dig> potentiated wnt signaling in müller glia and hek <dig> cells but not in cos <dig> cells, indicating that it is a cell-type specific regulator of wnt signaling. this unique dkk <dig> activity was blocked by co-expression of dkk <dig>  additionally, dkk <dig> displayed pro-survival properties by decreasing caspase activation and increasing viability in hek <dig> cells exposed to staurosporine and h2o <dig>  in contrast, dkk <dig> did not protect cos <dig> cells from apoptosis.


CONCLUSIONS
these data demonstrate that dkk <dig> is a positive regulator of wnt signaling, in contrast to its family member dkk <dig>  furthermore, dkk <dig> protects against apoptosis by reducing caspase activity, suggesting that dkk <dig> may play a cytoprotective role in the retina.
