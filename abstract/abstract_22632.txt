BACKGROUND
cystic fibrosis  airway pathology is a fatal, autosomal, recessive genetic disease characterized by extensive lung inflammation. after induction by tnf-α, elevated concentrations of several pro-inflammatory cytokines  and chemokines  are released from airway epithelial cells. in order to reduce the excessive inflammatory response in the airways of cf patients, new therapies have been developed and in this respect, medicinal plant extracts have been studied. in this article we have investigated the possible use of bergamot extracts  and their identified components to alter the expression of il- <dig> associated with the cystic fibrosis airway pathology.

methods
the extracts were chemically characterized by 1h-nmr , gc-fid , gc-ms  and hplc . both bergamot extracts and main detected chemical constituents were assayed for their biological activity measuring  cytokines and chemokines in culture supernatants released from cystic fibrosis ib3- <dig> cells treated with tnf-α by bio-plex cytokine assay;  accumulation of il- <dig> mrna by real-time pcr.


RESULTS
the extracts obtained from bergamot  epicarps contain components displaying an inhibitory activity on il- <dig>  particularly, the most active molecules were bergapten and citropten. these effects have been confirmed by analyzing mrna levels and protein release in the cf cellular models ib3- <dig> and cufi- <dig> induced with tnf-α or exposed to heat-inactivated pseudomonas aeruginosa.


CONCLUSIONS
these obtained results clearly indicate that bergapten and citropten are strong inhibitors of il- <dig> expression and could be proposed for further studies to verify possible anti-inflammatory properties to reduce lung inflammation in cf patients.
