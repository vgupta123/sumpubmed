BACKGROUND
as a key link between innate and adaptive immune responses, the interferon  system is the first line of defense against viral infection. ifn, and in particular, ifn-α, has been used clinically as an effective therapeutic agent for viral infections. however, different subtypes of ifn-α demonstrate distinct antiviral activity. therefore, it is important to identify ifn-α subtypes with high antiviral activity for the development of genetically engineered antiviral drugs.


RESULTS
in this study, we cloned the genes for  <dig> ifn-α subtypes from peripheral blood lymphocytes of the mink. the homologies of the  <dig> mink ifn-α genes were  <dig> – <dig> % and  <dig> – <dig> % at the nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels, respectively. in contrast to human and canine ifn-α subtypes, most mink ifn-α subtypes contained two n-glycosylation sites. we expressed and purified  <dig> mink ifn-α subtypes in escherichia coli. the cytopathic effect inhibition assay showed that all the  <dig> recombinant mink ifn-α subtypes inhibited the propagation of vesicular stomatitis virus in wish cells, with ifn-α <dig> and ifn-α <dig> demonstrating the highest activities. furthermore, recombinant mink ifn-α <dig> and ifn-α <dig> significantly suppressed the propagation of canine distemper virus in vero cells, with ifn-α <dig> demonstrating the highest activity.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified the mink ifn-α <dig> subtype as a promising candidate for the development of effective antiviral drugs.
