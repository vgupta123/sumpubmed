BACKGROUND
bats  are one of the most diverse groups of mammals which carry out important ecological and agricultural functions that are beneficial to humans. however, they are increasingly recognized as natural vectors for a number of zoonotic pathogens and favourable hosts for zoonotic infections. large populations of the straw-coloured fruit bat  colonize the main campus of the obafemi awolowo university , ile-ife, nigeria, but the public health implications of faecal contamination and pollution by these flying mammals is unknown. this study characterized s. aureus obtained from faecal samples of these migratory mammals with a view to determining the clonal types of the isolates, and to investigate the possibility of these flying animals as potential reservoir for zoonotic s. aureus infections.


RESULTS
one hundred and seven  s. aureus isolates were recovered from  <dig> faecal samples in eleven roosting sites from january  <dig> to february  <dig>  a large proportion of the isolates were susceptible to antibiotics, and molecular characterization of  <dig> isolates showed that  <dig>  were assigned in coagulase type vi, while accessory gene typing classified  <dig> isolates into the following: type i , type ii , type iii  and type iv . on the whole, the isolates were grouped in five  main genotypes. of the ten representative isolates selected for multilocus sequence typing , nine isolates were assigned with new sequence types: st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st2463-st <dig> and st <dig>  phylogenetic analysis provided evidence that s. aureus isolates in group c were closely related with st <dig> and associated clones identified in african monkeys, and group d isolates with st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig>  the two groups exhibited remarkable genetic diversity compared to the major s. aureus clade.


CONCLUSIONS
antibiotic resistance in faecal s. aureus isolates of e. helvum is low and multiple unique s. aureus lineages co-existed with e. helvum. the straw-coloured fruit bat in ile-ife, nigeria is colonized predominantly by st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> with distinct genotypic characteristics that are rarely found in humans. this study has demonstrated on the possible existence of a reservoir of indigenous and anciently-divergent s. aureus clones among mammals in africa.
