BACKGROUND
coffee contains several compounds that have the potential to influence breast cancer risk and survival. however, epidemiologic data on the relation between coffee compounds and breast cancer survival are sparse and inconsistent.


RESULTS
we show that coffee component hhq has significant apoptotic effect on mda-mb- <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells in vitro, and that ros generation, change in mitochondrial membrane permeability, upregulation of bax and caspase- <dig> as well as down regulation of pgk <dig> and pkm <dig> expression may be important apoptosis-inducing mechanisms. the results suggest that pparγ ligands may serve as potential therapeutic agents for breast cancer therapy. hhq was also validated as a ligand for pparγ by docking procedure.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report on the anti-breast cancer  activity of hhq.
