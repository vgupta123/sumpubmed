BACKGROUND
beta-n-acetylhexosaminidases belonging to the glycosyl hydrolase  <dig>  family are involved in the removal of terminal Î²-glycosidacally linked n-acetylhexosamine residues. these enzymes, widely distributed in microorganisms, animals and plants, are involved in many important physiological and pathological processes, such as cell structural integrity, energy storage, pathogen defence, viral penetration, cellular signalling, fertilization, development of carcinomas, inflammatory events and lysosomal storage diseases. nevertheless, only limited analyses of phylogenetic relationships between gh <dig> genes have been performed until now.


RESULTS
careful phylogenetic analyses of  <dig> inferred protein sequences from eukaryotes and prokaryotes reveal a complex history for the gh <dig> family. in bacteria, multiple gene duplications and lineage specific gene loss  are required to explain the observed taxonomic distribution. the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes is likely to have possessed at least one gh <dig> family member. at least one gene duplication before the divergence of animals, plants and fungi as well as other lineage specific duplication events have given rise to multiple paralogous subfamilies in eukaryotes. phylogenetic analyses also suggest that a second, divergent subfamily of gh <dig> family genes present in animals derive from an independent prokaryotic source. our data suggest multiple convergent changes of functional roles of gh <dig> family members in eukaryotes.


CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the first detailed evolutionary analysis of the glycosyl hydrolase gh <dig> family. mapping of data concerning physiological function of gh <dig> family members onto the phylogenetic tree reveals that apparently convergent and highly lineage specific changes in substrate specificity have occurred in multiple gh <dig> subfamilies.
