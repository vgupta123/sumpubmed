BACKGROUND
it is known that retinoid receptor function is attenuated during t cell activation, a phenomenon that involves actin remodeling, suggesting that actin modification may play a role in such inhibition. here we have investigated the role of actin dynamics and the effect of actin cytoskeleton modifying agents on retinoid receptor-mediated transactivation.


RESULTS
agents that disturb the f-actin assembly or disassembly attenuated receptor-mediated transcription indicating that actin cytoskeletal homeostasis is important for retinoid receptor function. overexpression or sirna-induced knockdown of cofilin- <dig> , a key regulator of f-actin assembly, induced the loss of receptor function. in addition, expression of either constitutively active or inactive/dominant-negative mutants of cfl1or cfl <dig> kinase limk <dig> induced loss of receptor function suggesting a critical role of the limk1-mediated cfl <dig> pathway in receptor-dependent transcription. further evidence of the role of lmk1/cfl1-mediated actin dynamics, was provided by studying the effect of nef, an actin modifying hiv- <dig> protein, on receptor function. expression of nef induced phosphorylation of cfl <dig> at serine  <dig> and limk <dig> at threonine  <dig>  inhibited retinoid-receptor mediated reporter activity, and the expression of a number of genes that contain retinoid receptor binding sites in their promoters. the results suggest that the nef-mediated inhibition of receptor function encompasses deregulation of actin filament dynamics by limk <dig> activation and phosphorylation of cfl <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a critical role of limk1-mediated cfl <dig> pathway and actin dynamics in modulating retinoid receptor mediated function and shown that limk1-mediated phosphocycling of cfl <dig> plays a crucial role in maintaining actin homeostasis and receptor activity. we suggest that t cell activation-induced repression of nuclear receptor-dependent transactivation is in part through the modification of actin dynamics.
