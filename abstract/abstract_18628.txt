BACKGROUND
compelling evidence indicates that shigella species, the etiologic agents of bacillary dysentery, as well as enteroinvasive escherichia coli, are derived from multiple origins of escherichia coli and form a single pathovar. to further understand the genome diversity and virulence evolution of shigella, comparative genomic hybridization microarray analysis was employed to compare the gene content of e. coli k- <dig> with those of  <dig> shigella strains from all lineages.


RESULTS
for the  <dig> strains subjected to cgh microarray analyses, the common backbone of the shigella genome was estimated to contain more than  <dig>  open reading frames , with a mean number of  <dig> undetectable orfs. the mosaic distribution of absent regions indicated that insertions and/or deletions have led to the highly diversified genomes of pathogenic strains.


CONCLUSIONS
these results support the hypothesis that by gain and loss of functions, shigella species became successful human pathogens through convergent evolution from diverse genomic backgrounds. moreover, we also found many specific differences between different lineages, providing a window into understanding bacterial speciation and taxonomic relationships.
