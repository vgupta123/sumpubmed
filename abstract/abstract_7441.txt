BACKGROUND
vibrio parahaemolyticus is a marine seafood-borne pathogen causing gastrointestinal disorders in humans. thermostable direct hemolysin  and tdh-related hemolysin  are known as major virulence determinants of v. parahaemolyticus. most v. parahaemolyticus isolates from the environment do not produce tdh or trh. total v. parahaemolyticus has been used as an indicator for control of seafood contamination toward prevention of infection. detection of total v. parahaemolyticus using conventional culture- and biochemical-based assays is time-consuming and laborious, requiring more than three days. thus, we developed a novel and highly specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification  assay for the sensitive and rapid detection of vibrio parahaemolyticus.


RESULTS
the assay provided markedly more sensitive and rapid detection of v. parahaemolyticus strains than conventional biochemical and pcr assays. the assay correctly identified  <dig> v. parahaemolyticus strains, but did not detect  <dig> non-parahaemolyticus vibrio and  <dig> non-vibrio strains. sensitivity of the lamp assay for direct detection of v. parahaemolyticus in pure cultures and in spiked shrimp samples was  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu per ml/g . the sensitivity of the lamp assay was 10-fold more sensitive than that of the conventional pcr assay. the lamp assay was markedly faster, requiring for amplification 13– <dig> min in a single colony on tcbs agar from each of  <dig> v. parahaemolyticus strains and less than  <dig> min in spiked shrimp samples. the lamp assay for detection of v. parahaemolyticus required less than  <dig> min in a single colony on thiosulfate citrate bile salt sucrose  agar and  <dig> min in spiked shrimp samples from the beginning of dna extraction to final determination.


CONCLUSIONS
the lamp assay is a sensitive, rapid and simple tool for the detection of v. parahaemolyticus and will facilitate the surveillance for control of contamination of v. parahaemolyticus in seafood.
