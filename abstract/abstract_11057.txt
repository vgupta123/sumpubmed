BACKGROUND
brassica juncea is an economically important vegetable crop in china, oil crop in india, condiment crop in europe and selected for canola quality recently in canada and australia. b. juncea  is an allotetraploid derived from interspecific hybridization between b. rapa  and b. nigra , followed by spontaneous chromosome doubling.


RESULTS
comparative genome analysis by genome survey sequence  of allopolyploid b. juncea with b. rapa was carried out based on high-throughput sequencing approaches. over  <dig>  gb of gss data were used for comparative analysis of b. juncea and b. rapa, producing  <dig> % reads mapping to the b. rapa genome with a high ratio of single-end reads. mapping data suggested more structure variation  in the b. juncea genome than in b. rapa. we detected  <dig> , <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  with high heterozygosity and  <dig>  svs, including 1-3Â bp indels, between b. juncea and b. rapa. non-synonymous polymorphisms in glucosinolate biosynthesis genes may account for differences in glucosinolate biosynthesis and glucosinolate components between b. juncea and b. rapa. furthermore, we identified distinctive vernalization-dependent and photoperiod-dependent flowering pathways coexisting in allopolyploid b. juncea, suggesting contribution of these pathways to adaptation for survival during polyploidization.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, we proposed that polyploidization has allowed for accelerated evolution of the glucosinolate biosynthesis and flowering pathways in b. juncea that likely permit the phenotypic variation observed in the crop.
