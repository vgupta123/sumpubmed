BACKGROUND
legionella pneumophila is an intracellular pathogen of environmental protozoa. when humans inhale contaminated aerosols this bacterium may cause a severe pneumonia called legionnaires' disease. despite the abundance of dozens of legionella species in aquatic reservoirs, the vast majority of human disease is caused by a single serogroup  of a single species, namely l. pneumophila sg <dig>  to get further insights into genome dynamics and evolution of sg <dig> strains, we sequenced strains lorraine and hl  <dig>  <dig>  and compared them to the available sequences of sg <dig> strains paris, lens, corby and philadelphia, resulting in a comprehensive multigenome analysis.


RESULTS
we show that l. pneumophila sg <dig> has a highly conserved and syntenic core genome that comprises the many eukaryotic like proteins and a conserved repertoire of over  <dig> dot/icm type iv secreted substrates. however, recombination events and horizontal gene transfer are frequent. in particular the analyses of the distribution of nucleotide polymorphisms suggests that large chromosomal fragments of over  <dig> kbs are exchanged between l. pneumophila strains and contribute to the genome dynamics in the natural population. the many secretion systems present might be implicated in exchange of these fragments by conjugal transfer. plasmids also play a role in genome diversification and are exchanged among strains and circulate between different legionella species.


CONCLUSIONS
horizontal gene transfer among bacteria and from eukaryotes to l. pneumophila as well as recombination between strains allows different clones to evolve into predominant disease clones and others to replace them subsequently within relatively short periods of time.
