BACKGROUND
acetylation of the xylan backbone was a major obstacle to enzymatic decomposition. removal of acetyl groups by acetyl xylan esterases  is essential for completely enzymatic hydrolysis of xylan. appended carbohydrate binding modules  can promote the enzymatic deconstruction of plant cell walls by targeting and proximity effects. fungal acetyl xylan esterases are strictly appended to cellulose-specific cbm <dig>  it is still unclear whether xylan-specific cbms have a greater advantage than cbm <dig> in potentiating the activity of fungal deacetylating enzymes and its synergistic hydrolysis of different substrates with xylanase.


RESULTS
three recombinant axe1s fused with different xylan-specific cbms, together with wild-type axe <dig> with cbm <dig> and cbm1-deleted mutant axe1dc, were constructed in this study. the optimal temperature and ph of recombinant axe1s was 50 °c and  <dig>  , respectively. cellulose-specific cbm <dig> in axe <dig> obviously contributed to its catalytic action against substrates compared with axe1dc. however, replacement of cbm <dig> with xylan-specific cbm4- <dig> significantly enhanced axe <dig> thermostability and catalytic activity against soluble substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl acetate. whereas replacements with xylan-specific cbm <dig> and cbm22- <dig> were more effective in enzymatic release of acetic acid from destarched wheat bran, naclo2-treated wheat straw, and water-insoluble wheat arabinoxylan compared to axe <dig>  moreover, replacement with cbm <dig> and cbm22- <dig> also resulted in higher degree releases of reducing sugar and acetic acid from different substrates when simultaneous hydrolysis with xylanase. a good linear relationship exists between the acetic acid and reducing sugar release.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggested that the replacement with cbm <dig> and cbm22- <dig> not only significantly improved the catalysis efficiency of axe <dig>  but also increased its synergistic hydrolysis of different substrates with xylanase, indicating the significance of targeting effect in axe <dig> catalysis mediated by xylan-specific cbms.
