BACKGROUND
experimental evolution of microbial populations provides a unique opportunity to study evolutionary adaptation in response to controlled selective pressures. however, until recently it has been difficult to identify the precise genetic changes underlying adaptation at a genome-wide scale. new dna sequencing technologies now allow the genome of parental and evolved strains of microorganisms to be rapidly determined.


RESULTS
we sequenced > <dig> % of the genome of a laboratory-evolved strain of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and its ancestor at >28× depth. both single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number amplifications were found, with specific gains over array-based methodologies previously used to analyze these genomes. applying a segmentation algorithm to quantify structural changes, we determined the approximate genomic boundaries of a 5× gene amplification. these boundaries guided the recovery of breakpoint sequences, which provide insights into the nature of a complex genomic rearrangement.


CONCLUSIONS
this study suggests that whole-genome sequencing can provide a rapid approach to uncover the genetic basis of evolutionary adaptations, with further applications in the study of laboratory selections and mutagenesis screens. in addition, we show how single-end, short read sequencing data can provide detailed information about structural rearrangements, and generate predictions about the genomic features and processes that underlie genome plasticity.
