BACKGROUND
the secreted enzyme endos, an endoglycosidase from streptococcus pyogenes, hydrolyzes the n-linked glycan of the constant region of immunoglobulin g  heavy chain and renders the antibody unable to interact with fc receptors and elicit effector functions. in this study we couple targeted allelic replacement mutagenesis and heterologous expression to elucidate the contribution of endos to group a streptococcus  phagocyte resistance and pathogenicity in vitro and in vivo.


RESULTS
knocking out the endos gene in gas m1t <dig> background revealed no significant differences in bacterial survival in immune cell killing assays or in a systemic mouse model of infection. however, exogenous addition and heterologous expression of endos was found to increase gas resistance to killing by neutrophils and monocytes in vitro. additionally, heterologous expression of endos in m <dig> gas increased mouse virulence in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that in a highly virulent m1t <dig> background, endos has no significant impact on gas phagocyte resistance and pathogenicity. however, local accumulation or high levels of expression of endos in certain gas strains may contribute to virulence.
