BACKGROUND
if european silver eels are prevented from reproductive migration, they remain in a prepubertal stage by dopaminergic inhibition of pituitary activity. because this inhibition is likely a requirement for an extended female growth stage, we tested if it is sex-specific by subjecting both sexes to stimulation by gnrha  – injection or 3-months swimming in seawater.


RESULTS
in contrast to females, males showed a two- to three-fold higher lhβ  – expression, a three- to five-fold higher gsi  and induced spermatogenesis when compared with the untreated control group.


CONCLUSIONS
dopaminergic inhibition is thus not effective in males and swimming results in natural maturation, probably via gnrh-release.
