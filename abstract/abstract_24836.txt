BACKGROUND
the fungus stagonospora nodorum is a necrotrophic pathogen of wheat. it causes disease by secreting proteinaceous effectors which interact with proteins encoded by dominant susceptibility genes in the host. the outcome of these interactions results in necrosis, allowing the fungus to thrive on dead plant material. the mechanisms of these effectors though are poorly understood. in this study, we undertake a comprehensive transcriptomics, proteomic and metabolomic approach to understand how a susceptible wheat cultivar responds to exposure to the stagonospora nodorum effector protein sntox <dig> 


RESULTS
microarray and proteomic studies revealed that sntox <dig> strongly induced responses consistent with those previously associated with classical host defence pathways including the expression of pathogenicity-related proteins and the induction of cell death. collapse of the photosynthetic machinery was also apparent at the transcriptional and translational level. sntox3-infiltrated wheat leaves also showed a strong induction of enzymes involved in primary metabolism consistent with increases in hexoses, amino acids and organic acids as determined by primary metabolite profiling. methionine and homocysteine metabolism was strongly induced upon exposure to sntox <dig>  pathogenicity in the presence of homocysteine was inhibited confirming that the compound has a role in plant defence. consistent with the strong defence responses observed, secondary metabolite profiling revealed the induction of several compounds associated with plant defence, including the phenylpropanoids chlorogenic acid and feruloylquinic acid, and the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin. serotonin did not accumulate subsequent to sntox <dig> infiltration.


CONCLUSIONS
these data support the theory that the sntox <dig> effector protein elicits a host cell death response to facilitate the pathogen’s necrotrophic infection cycle. our data also demonstrate that the mechanism of sntox <dig> appears distinct from the previously characterised stagonospora nodorum effector sntoxa. collectively, this comprehensive analysis has advanced our understanding of necrotrophic effector biology and highlighted the complexity of effector-triggered susceptibility.
