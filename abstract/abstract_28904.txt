BACKGROUND
alzheimer disease is a multifactorial disorder characterized by the progressive deterioration of neuronal networks. the pathological hallmarks includes extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, but the primary cause is only partially understood. thus, there is growing interest in developing agents that might target multiple mechanisms leading to neuronal degeneration. chf <dig> is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory derivative that has been shown to behave as a γ-secretase modulator in vitro and to inhibit plaque deposition and to reverse memory deficit in vivo in transgenic mouse models of alzheimer’s disease . in the present study, the effects of a long-term  treatment with chf <dig> on indicators of brain functionality and neurodegeneration in transgenic ad mice  have been assessed and compared with those induced by a prototypical γ-secretase inhibitor .


RESULTS
to this end, plaque-free, 6-month-old tg <dig> mice and wild-type littermates were fed with a diet containing chf <dig> , dapt  or vehicle for 13 months. the measured indicators included object recognition memory, amyloid burden, brain oligomeric and plasma aβ levels, intraneuronal aβ, dendritic spine density/morphology, neuronal cyclin a positivity and activated microglia. tg <dig> mice fed with standard diet displayed an impairment of recognition memory. this deficit was completely reverted by the higher dose of chf <dig>  while no effects were observed in dapt-treated mice. similarly, amyloid plaque burden, microglia activation and aberrant cell cycle events were significantly affected by chf <dig>  but not dapt, treatment. both chf <dig> and dapt reduced intraneuronal aβ content, also increasing aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> plasma levels.


CONCLUSIONS
this comparative analysis revealed a profoundly diverse range of clinically relevant effects differentiating the multifunctional anti-inflammatory derivative chf <dig> from the γ-secretase inhibitor dapt and highlighted unique mechanisms and potential targets that may be crucial for neuroprotection in mouse models of ad.
