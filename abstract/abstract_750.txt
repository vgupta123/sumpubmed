BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small, non-coding 21â€“ <dig> nt rna molecules that play an important role in regulating gene expression. little is known about the expression profiles and functions of mirnas in skin and their role in pigmentation. alpacas have more than  <dig> natural coat colors, more than any other fiber producing species. to better understand the role of mirnas in control of coat color we performed a comprehensive analysis of mirna expression profiles in skin of white versus brown alpacas.


RESULTS
two small rna libraries from white alpaca  and brown alpaca  skin were sequenced with the aid of illumina sequencing technology.  <dig> and  <dig> conserved mirnas were obtained from the wa and ba skin libraries, respectively. of these conserved mirnas,  <dig> and  <dig> were more abundant in wa and ba skin, respectively. the targets of these mirnas were predicted and grouped based on gene ontology and kegg pathway analysis. many predicted target genes for these mirnas are involved in the melanogenesis pathway controlling pigmentation. in addition to the conserved mirnas, we also obtained  <dig> potentially novel mirnas from the wa and ba skin libraries.


CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the first comprehensive survey of mirnas expressed in skin of animals of different coat colors by deep sequencing analysis. we discovered a collection of mirnas that are differentially expressed in wa and ba skin. the results suggest important potential functions of mirnas in coat color regulation.
