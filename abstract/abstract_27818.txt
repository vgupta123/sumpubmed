BACKGROUND
network component analysis  is a network structure-driven framework for deducing regulatory signal dynamics. in contrast to principal component analysis, which can be employed to select the high-variance genes, nca makes use of the connectivity structure from transcriptional regulatory networks to infer dynamics of transcription factor activities. using the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system, we aim to deduce regulatory actions of cytokinesis-related genes, using precise spatial proximity  and/or temporal synchronicity  to avoid full-scale computation from genome-wide databases.


RESULTS
nca was applied to infer regulatory actions of transcription factor activity from microarray data and partial transcription factor-gene connectivity information for cytokinesis-related genes, which were a subset of genome-wide datasets. no literature has so far discussed the inferred results through nca are independent of the scale of the gene expression dataset. to avoid full-scale computation from genome-wide databases, four cytokinesis-related gene cases were selected for nca by running computational analysis over the transcription factor database to confirm the approach being scale-free. the inferred dynamics of transcription factor activity through nca were independent of the scale of the data matrix selected from the four cytokinesis-related gene sets. moreover, the inferred regulatory actions were nearly identical to published observations for the selected cytokinesis-related genes in the budding yeast; namely, mcm <dig>  ndd <dig>  and fkh <dig>  which form a transcription factor complex to control expression of the clb <dig> cluster .


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, using s. cerevisiae as a model system, nca was successfully applied to infer similar regulatory actions of transcription factor activities from two various microarray databases and several partial transcription factor-gene connectivity datasets for selected cytokinesis-related genes independent of data sizes. the regulated action for four selected cytokinesis-related genes  belongs to the m-phase or m/g <dig> phase, consistent with the empirical observations that in s. cerevisiae, the mcm1-ndd1-fkh <dig> transcription factor complex can regulate expression of the cytokinesis-related genes bud <dig>  chs <dig>  iqg <dig>  and cdc <dig>  since bud <dig>  iqg <dig>  and cdc <dig> are highly conserved between human and yeast, results obtained from nca for cytokinesis in the budding yeast can lead to a suggestion that human cells should have the transcription regulator as the budding yeast mcm1-ndd1-fkh <dig> transcription factor complex in controlling occurrence of cytokinesis.
