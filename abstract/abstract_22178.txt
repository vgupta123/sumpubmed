BACKGROUND
the adipose tissue is an endocrine regulator and a risk factor for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease when by excessive accumulation induces obesity. although the adipose tissue is also a reservoir for stem cells  their function and “stemcellness” has been questioned. our aim was to investigate the mechanisms by which obesity affects subcutaneous white adipose tissue  stem cells.


RESULTS
transcriptomics, in silico analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction  and western blots were performed on isolated stem cells from subcutaneous abdominal wat of morbidly obese patients  and of non-obese individuals . ascmo and ascn gene expression clustered separately from each other. ascmo showed downregulation of “stemness” genes and upregulation of adipogenic and inflammatory genes with respect to ascn. moreover, the application of bioinformatics and ingenuity pathway analysis  showed that the transcription factor smad <dig> was tentatively affected in obese ascmo. validation of this target confirmed a significantly reduced smad <dig> nuclear translocation in the isolated ascmo.


CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptomic profile of the stem cells reservoir in obese subcutaneous wat is highly modified with significant changes in genes regulating stemcellness, lineage commitment and inflammation. in addition to body mass index, cardiovascular risk factor clustering further affect the asc transcriptomic profile inducing loss of multipotency and, hence, capacity for tissue repair. in summary, the stem cells in the subcutaneous wat niche of obese patients are already committed to adipocyte differentiation and show an upregulated inflammatory gene expression associated to their loss of stemcellness.
