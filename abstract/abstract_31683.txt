BACKGROUND
salmonids are one of the most intensely studied fish, in part due to their economic and environmental importance, and in part due to a recent whole genome duplication in the common ancestor of salmonids. this duplication greatly impacts species diversification, functional specialization, and adaptation. extensive new genomic resources have recently become available for atlantic salmon , but documentation of allelic versus duplicate reference genes remains a major uncertainty in the complete characterization of its genome and its evolution.


RESULTS
from existing expressed sequence tag  resources and three new full-length cdna libraries,  <dig>  reference quality full-length gene insert clones were identified for atlantic salmon. a further  <dig>  reference full-length clones were annotated from  <dig>  northern pike  ests. pairwise dn/ds comparisons within each of  <dig> sets of duplicated salmon genes using northern pike as a diploid out-group show asymmetric relaxation of selection on salmon duplicates.


CONCLUSIONS
 <dig>  full-length reference genes were characterized in s. salar and can be used to identify alleles and gene family members. comparisons of duplicated genes show that while purifying selection is the predominant force acting on both duplicates, consistent with retention of functionality in both copies, some relaxation of pressure on gene duplicates can be identified. in addition, there is evidence that evolution has acted asymmetrically on paralogs, allowing one of the pair to diverge at a faster rate.
