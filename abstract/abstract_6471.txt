BACKGROUND
the ras-related gtpase, rheb, regulates the growth of animal cells. genetic and biochemical tests place rheb upstream of the target of rapamycin  protein kinase, and downstream of the tuberous sclerosis complex  and the insulin-signaling pathway. tor activity is regulated by nutritional cues, suggesting that rheb might either control, or respond to, nutrient availability.


RESULTS
we show that rheb and tor do not promote the import of glucose, bulk amino acids, or arginine in drosophila s <dig> cells, but that both gene products are important regulators of ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis, and cell size. s <dig> cell size, protein synthesis, and glucose import were largely insensitive to manipulations of insulin signaling components, suggesting that cellular energy levels and tor activity can be maintained through insulin/pi3k-independent mechanisms in s <dig> cell culture. in vivo in drosophila larvae, however, we found that insulin signaling can regulate protein synthesis, and thus may affect tor activity.


CONCLUSIONS
rheb-tor signaling controls s <dig> cell growth by promoting ribosome production and protein synthesis, but apparently not by direct effects on the import of amino acids or glucose. the effect of insulin signaling upon tor activity varies according to cellular type and context.
