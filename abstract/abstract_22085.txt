BACKGROUND
staphylococcal protein a  is an important virulence factor which enables staphylococcus aureus to evade host immune responses. genotypes known as “spa-types”, based on highly variable xr region sequences of the spa-gene, are frequently used to classify strains. a weakness of current spa-typing primers is that rearrangements in the igg-binding region of the gene cause 1-2% of strains to be designated as “non-typeable”.


RESULTS
we developed an improved primer which enabled sequencing of all strains, containing any type of genetic rearrangement, in a large study among community carriers and hospital inpatients in oxfordshire, uk . we identified eight novel spa-gene variants, plus one previously described. three of these rearrangements would be designated “non-typeable” using current spa-typing methods; they occurred in  <dig> %  asymptomatically carried and  <dig> %  inpatient s. aureus strains. some individuals were simultaneously colonized by both formerly non-typeable and typeable strains; previously such patients would have been identified as carrying only currently typeable strains, underestimating mixed carriage prevalence and diversity. formerly non-typeable strains were found in more spa-types associated with multilocus sequence type st <dig> , common among livestock, compared to other groups with any non-typeable strains , suggesting particular spa-types may have been under-represented in previous human studies.


CONCLUSIONS
this improved method allows us to spa-type previously non-typeable strains with rearrangements in the spa-gene and to resolve cases of mixed colonization with deletions in one or more strains, thus accounting for hidden diversity of s. aureus in both community and hospital environments.
