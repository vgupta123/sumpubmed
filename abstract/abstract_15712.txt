BACKGROUND
drug discovery and design are important research fields in bioinformatics. enumeration of chemical compounds is essential not only for the purpose, but also for analysis of chemical space and structure elucidation. in our previous study, we developed enumeration methods bfssimenum and bfsmulenum for tree-like chemical compounds using a tree-structure to represent a chemical compound, which is limited to acyclic chemical compounds only.


RESULTS
in this paper, we extend the methods, and develop bfsbennaphenum that can enumerate tree-like chemical compounds containing benzene rings and naphthalene rings, which include benzene isomers and naphthalene isomers such as ortho, meta, and para, by treating a benzene ring as an atom with valence six, instead of a ring of six carbon atoms, and treating a naphthalene ring as two benzene rings having a special bond. we compare our method with molgen  <dig> , which is a well-known general purpose structure generator, to enumerate chemical structures from a set of chemical formulas in terms of the number of enumerated structures and the computational time. the result suggests that our proposed method can reduce the computational time efficiently.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose the enumeration method bfsbennaphenum for tree-like chemical compounds containing benzene rings and naphthalene rings as cyclic structures. bfsbennaphenum was from  <dig> times to  <dig> , <dig> times faster than molgen  <dig>  for instances with  <dig> to  <dig> carbon atoms in our experiments.
