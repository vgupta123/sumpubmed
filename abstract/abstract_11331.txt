BACKGROUND
deinococcus radiodurans accumulates high levels of manganese ions, and this is believed to be correlated with the radiation resistance ability of this microorganism. however, the maintenance of manganese ion homeostasis in d. radiodurans remains to be investigated.


RESULTS
in this study, we identified the manganese efflux protein  in d. radiodurans. the null mutant of mnte was more sensitive than the wild-type strain to manganese ions, and the growth of the mnte mutant was delayed in manganese-supplemented media. furthermore, there was a substantial increase in the in vivo concentration of manganese ions. consistent with these characteristics, the mnte mutant was more resistant to h2o <dig>  ultraviolet rays, and Î³-radiation. the intracellular protein oxidation  level of the mutant strain was remarkably lower than that of the wild-type strain.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicated that dr <dig> is indeed a mnte homologue and is indispensable for maintaining manganese homeostasis in d. radiodurans. the data also provide additional evidence for the involvement of intracellular manganese ions in the radiation resistance of d. radiodurans.
