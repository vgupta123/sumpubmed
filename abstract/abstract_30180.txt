BACKGROUND
detection of dna-binding sites in proteins is of enormous interest for technologies targeting gene regulation and manipulation. we have previously shown that a residue and its sequence neighbor information can be used to predict dna-binding candidates in a protein sequence. this sequence-based prediction method is applicable even if no sequence homology with a previously known dna-binding protein is observed. here we implement a neural network based algorithm to utilize evolutionary information of amino acid sequences in terms of their position specific scoring matrices  for a better prediction of dna-binding sites.


RESULTS
an average of sensitivity and specificity using pssms is up to  <dig> % better than the prediction with sequence information only. much smaller data sets could be used to generate pssm with minimal loss of prediction accuracy.


CONCLUSIONS
one problem in using pssm-derived prediction is obtaining lengthy and time-consuming alignments against large sequence databases. in order to speed up the process of generating pssms, we tried to use different reference data sets  against which a target protein is scanned for psi-blast iterations. we find that a very small set of proteins can actually be used as such a reference data without losing much of the prediction value. this makes the process of generating pssms very rapid and even amenable to be used at a genome level. a web server has been developed to provide these predictions of dna-binding sites for any new protein from its amino acid sequence.
