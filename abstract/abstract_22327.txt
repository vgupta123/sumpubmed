BACKGROUND
vibrio parahaemolyticus is associated with gastroenteritis, wound infections, and septicemia in human and animals. phages can control the population of the pathogen. so far, the only one reported genome among giant vibriophages is kvp40:  <dig>  bp with 26% coding regions that have t <dig> homologs. putative homing endonucleases  were found in vibrio phage kvp <dig> bearing one segd and vibrio cholerae phage icp <dig> carrying one mobc/e and one segg.


RESULTS
a newly isolated vibrio phage ϕpp <dig>  which was specific to the hosts of v. parahaemolyticus and v. alginolyticus, featured a long nonenveloped head of ~90 ×  <dig> nm and tail of ~ <dig> nm. the phage can survive at 50°c for more than one hour. the genome of the phage ϕpp <dig> was sequenced to be  <dig>  bp, which is  <dig> bp larger than kvp <dig>   <dig> protein-encoding genes  and  <dig> trnas were found in the phage ϕpp <dig>  between the genomes of ϕpp <dig> and kvp <dig>   <dig> genes including  <dig> pegs for viral structure were of high similarity, whereas  <dig> pegs of kvp <dig> and  <dig> pegs of ϕpp <dig> were unmatched. in both genomes, the capsid and tail genes have been identified, as well as the extensive representation of the dna replication, recombination, and repair enzymes. in addition to the three giant indels of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nt, ϕpp <dig> possessed unique proteins involved in potassium channel, gp <dig> , trna nucleotidyltransferase, and mob-type hes, which were not reported in kvp <dig>  the ϕpp <dig> peg <dig>  with strong promoters and translational initiation, was identified to be a mobe type, flanked by nrda and nrdb/c homologs. coincidently, several pairs of he-flanking homologs with empty center were found in the phages of vibrio phages ϕpp <dig> and kvp <dig>  as well as in aeromonas phages , and cyanophage p-ssm <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
vibrio phage ϕpp <dig> was characterized by morphology, growth, and genomics with three giant indels and different types of hes. the gene analysis on the required elements for transcription and translation suggested that the ϕpp <dig> peg <dig> was an active mobe gene. the phage was signified to be a new species of t4-related, differing from kvp <dig>
