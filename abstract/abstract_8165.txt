BACKGROUND
dual-specificity phosphatase- <dig>  plays a central role in vascular development and disease. we present a p-nitrophenol phosphate  based enzymatic assay to screen for inhibitors of the phosphatase domain of dusp <dig> 

methods
pnpp is a mimic of the phosphorylated tyrosine on the erk <dig> substrate  and binds the dusp <dig> phosphatase domain with a km of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm. docking followed by inhibitor verification using the pnpp assay identified a series of polysulfonated aromatic inhibitors that occupy the dusp <dig> active site in the region that is likely occupied by the dual-phosphorylated erk <dig> substrate tripeptide . secondary assays were performed with full length dusp <dig> with erk <dig> as substrate.


RESULTS
the most potent inhibitor has a naphthalene trisulfonate  core. a search for similar compounds in a drug database identified suramin, a dimerized form of nts. while suramin appears to be a potent and competitive inhibitor , binding to the dusp <dig> phosphatase domain more tightly than the monomeric ligands of which it is comprised, it also aggregates. further ligand-based screening, based on a pharmacophore derived from the 7 Å separation of sulfonates on inhibitors and on sulfates present in the dusp <dig> crystal structure, identified a disulfonated and phenolic naphthalene inhibitor  with ic <dig> of 33 μm that is similar to nts and does not aggregate.


CONCLUSIONS
the new dusp <dig> inhibitors we identify in this study typically have sulfonates 7 Å apart, likely positioning them where the two phosphates of the substrate peptide  bind, with one inhibitor also positioning a phenolic hydroxyl where the water nucleophile may reside. polysulfonated aromatic compounds do not commonly appear in drugs and have a tendency to aggregate. one fda-approved polysulfonated drug, suramin, inhibits dusp <dig> and also aggregates. docking and modeling studies presented herein identify polysulfonated aromatic inhibitors that do not aggregate, and provide insights to guide future design of mimics of the dual-phosphate loops of the erk substrates for dusps.
