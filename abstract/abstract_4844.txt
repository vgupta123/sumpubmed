BACKGROUND
many studies implicate arf <dig> activity in rac-mediated membrane ruffling and cytoskeletal reorganization. although arf <dig> facilitates the trafficking of rac <dig> to the plasma membrane and in many cases arf <dig> activation leads to the activation of rac <dig>  the details of how arf <dig> influences rac function remain to be elucidated.


RESULTS
we demonstrate in binding assays and by co-immunoprecipitation that gdp-bound arf <dig> binds to kalirin <dig>  a rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factor, through interaction with the spectrin repeat region. in cells, expression of wild type arf <dig> recruits spectrin repeat  <dig> and kalirin to the plasma membrane and leads to enhanced kalirin5-induced ruffling. by contrast, expression of an arf <dig> mutant that cannot become activated, arf <dig> t27n, still recruits spectrin repeat  <dig> and kalirin to membranes but inhibits kalirin5-induced ruffling in hela cells. kalirin5-induced rac <dig> activation is increased by the expression of wild type arf <dig> and decreased by arf6t27n. furthermore, expression of a catalytically-inactive mutant of kalirin <dig> inhibits cytoskeletal changes observed in cells expressing efa <dig>  an arf <dig> guanine nucleotide exchange factor that leads to activation of rac.


CONCLUSIONS
we show here with over-expressed proteins that the gdp-bound form of arf <dig> can bind to the spectrin repeat regions in kalirin rho family gefs thereby recruiting kalirin to membranes. although kalirin is recruited onto membranes by arf6-gdp, subsequent rac activation and membrane ruffling requires arf <dig> activation. from these results, we suggest that arf <dig> can regulate through its gtpase cycle the activation of rac.
