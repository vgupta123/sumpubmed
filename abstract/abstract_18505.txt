BACKGROUND
when flow cytometric data on mixtures of cell populations are collected from samples under different experimental conditions, computational methods are needed  to classify the samples into similar groups, and  to characterize the changes within the corresponding populations due to the different conditions. manual inspection has been used in the past to study such changes, but high-dimensional experiments necessitate developing new computational approaches to this problem. a robust solution to this problem is to construct distinct templates to summarize all samples from a class, and then to compare these templates to study the changes across classes or conditions.


RESULTS
we designed a hierarchical algorithm, flowmatch, to first match the corresponding clusters across samples for producing robust meta-clusters, and to then construct a high-dimensional template as a collection of meta-clusters for each class of samples. we applied the algorithm on flow cytometry data obtained from human blood cells before and after stimulation with anti-cd <dig> monoclonal antibody, which is reported to change phosphorylation responses of memory and naive t cells. the flowmatch algorithm is able to construct representative templates from the samples before and after stimulation, and to match corresponding meta-clusters across templates. the templates of the pre-stimulation and post-stimulation data corresponding to memory and naive t cell populations clearly show, at the level of the meta-clusters, the overall phosphorylation shift due to the stimulation.


CONCLUSIONS
we concisely represent each class of samples by a template consisting of a collection of meta-clusters . using flowmatch, the meta-clusters across samples can be matched to assess overall differences among the samples of various phenotypes or time-points.
