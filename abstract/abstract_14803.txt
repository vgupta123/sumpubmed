BACKGROUND
rab proteins are regulators of vesicular trafficking, requiring a lipid modification for proper function, prenylation of c-terminal cysteines. this is catalysed by a complex of a catalytic heterodimer  and an accessory protein . components of this complex display domain insertions relative to paralogous proteins. the function of these inserted domains is unclear.


RESULTS
we profiled the domain architecture of the components of the rab prenylation complex in evolution. we identified the orthologues of the components of the rab prenylation machinery in  <dig> organisms, representing the crown eukaryotic groups. we characterize in detail the domain structure of all these components and the phylogenetic relationships between the individual domains.


CONCLUSIONS
we found different domain insertions in different taxa, in Î±-subunits of rggtase and rep. our results suggest that there were multiple insertions, expansions and contractions in the evolution of this prenylation complex.
