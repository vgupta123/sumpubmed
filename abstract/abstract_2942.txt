BACKGROUND
massively parallel sequencing  technologies have the capacity to sequence targeted regions or whole genomes of multiple nucleic acid samples with high coverage by sequencing millions of dna fragments simultaneously. compared with sanger sequencing, mps also can reduce labor and cost on a per nucleotide basis and indeed on a per sample basis. in this study, whole genomes of human mitochondria  were sequenced on the personal genome machine  , the out data were assessed, and the results were compared with data previously generated on the miseqtm . the objectives of this paper were to determine the feasibility, accuracy, and reliability of sequence data obtained from the pgm.


RESULTS
 <dig> samples were multiplexed  and sequenced on the at least  <dig> megabase throughput  <dig> chip. the depth of coverage pattern was similar among all  <dig> samples; however the coverage across the genome varied. for strand bias, the average ratio of coverage between the forward and reverse strands at each nucleotide position indicated that two-thirds of the positions of the genome had ratios that were greater than  <dig> . a few sites had more extreme strand bias. another observation was that  <dig> positions had a false deletion rate greater than  <dig>  in one or more individuals. there were 31- <dig>  mtgenome variants observed per sample for the  <dig> samples analyzed. the total  <dig>  variants were concordant between the results from the pgm and miseq. the quality scores for haplogroup assignment for all  <dig> samples ranged between  <dig> %-100%.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, mtdna sequence data generated from the pgm were analyzed and the output evaluated. depth of coverage variation and strand bias were identified but generally were infrequent and did not impact reliability of variant calls. multiplexing of samples was demonstrated which can improve throughput and reduce cost per sample analyzed. overall, the results of this study, based on orthogonal concordance testing and phylogenetic scrutiny, supported that whole mtgenome sequence data with high accuracy can be obtained using the pgm platform.
