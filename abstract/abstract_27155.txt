BACKGROUND
bacteriophages have the destructive damage on the industrial bioprocess. 2-keto-gluconic acid  producing bacteria had also been attacked and lysed by bacteriophages which lowered the glucose consumption and 2kga yield and even stopped the fermentation process. in this study, we presented the characteristics of a novel virulent bacteriophage specifically infecting pseudomonas fluorescens k <dig> and proposed an efficient remedial action for this phage infection to reduce the production loss.


RESULTS
the phage ksl- <dig> of pseudomonas fluorescens k <dig> was isolated from abnormal 2kga fermentation broth. it belonged to the siphoviridae family with a hexagonal head diameter of about 99 nm and a non-contractile tail of about 103 nm × 39 nm. the genome size of phage ksl- <dig> was estimated to be approximately  <dig> kbp. its optimal moi to infect p. fluorescens k <dig> was about  <dig> . one-step growth curve gave its latent and burst periods of 90 min and 75 min with a burst size of  <dig> phage particles per infected cell. this phage was stable with a ph range of  <dig> – <dig> , and sensitive to thermal treatment. finally, a simple remedial action was proposed by feeding fresh seed culture. compared with the infected 2kga fermentation, the remedial experiments restored 2kga fermentation performance by increasing the produced 2kga concentration to  <dig>  g/l and shortening the total fermentation time of 80 h with the productivity and yield of  <dig>  g/l.h and  <dig>  g/g. the obtained data proved that this method was effective to combat the phage infections problems during the 2kga fermentation.


CONCLUSIONS
the phage ksl- <dig> was a novel bacteriophage specifically infecting pseudomonas fluorescens k <dig>  the remedial action of feeding fresh seed culture to the infected broth was an easily-operating and effective method to maintain a high 2kga yield and avoid the draft of infected broth.
