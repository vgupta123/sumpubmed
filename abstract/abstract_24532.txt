BACKGROUND
parathyroid hormone  gene expression is regulated post-transcriptionally through the binding of the trans-acting proteins au rich binding factor  <dig> , upstream of n-ras  and kh-type splicing regulatory protein  to an au rich element  in pth mrna 3'-utr. auf <dig> and unr stabilize pth mrna while ksrp, recruiting the exoribonucleolytic complex exosome, promotes pth mrna decay.


RESULTS
pth mrna is cleaved by the endoribonuclease polysomal ribonuclease  <dig>  in an are-dependent manner. moreover, pmr <dig> co-immunoprecipitates with pth mrna, the exosome and ksrp. knock-down of either exosome components or ksrp by sirnas prevents pmr1-mediated cleavage of pth mrna.


CONCLUSIONS
pth mrna is a target for the endonuclease pmr <dig>  the pmr <dig> mediated decrease in pth mrna levels involves the pth mrna 3'-utr are, ksrp and the exosome. this represents an unanticipated mechanism by which the decay of an are-containing mrna is facilitated by ksrp and is dependent on both the exosome and an endoribonuclease.
