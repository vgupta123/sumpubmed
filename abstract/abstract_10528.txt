BACKGROUND
the human papillomavirus  genome is divided into early and late coding sequences, including  <dig> open reading frames  and a regulatory region . viral gene expression may be regulated through epigenetic mechanisms, including cytosine methylation at cpg dinucleotides. we have analyzed the distribution of cpg sites and cpg islands/clusters  among  <dig> different hpv genomes grouped in function of their preferential tropism: cutaneous or mucosal. we calculated the proportion of cpg sites  for each orf and calculated the expected cpg values for each viral type.


RESULTS
cpgs are underrepresented in viral genomes. we found a positive correlation between cpg observed and expected values, with mucosal high-risk  virus types showing the smallest o/e ratios. the ranges of the pcs were similar for most genomic regions except e <dig>  where the majority of cpgs are found within islands/clusters. at least one cgi belongs to each e2/e <dig> region. we found positive correlations between pcs for each viral orf when compared with the others, except for the lcr against four orfs and e <dig> against three other orfs. the distribution of cpg islands/clusters among hpv groups is heterogeneous and mucosal hr-hpv types exhibit both lower number and shorter island sizes compared to cutaneous and mucosal low-risk  hpvs .


CONCLUSIONS
there is a difference between viral and cellular cpg underrepresentation. there are significant correlations between complete genome pcs and a lack of correlations between several genomic region pairs, especially those involving lcr and e <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> orf behavior is opposite to that of oncogenes e <dig> and e <dig>  the first pair possesses relatively low numbers of cpg sites clustered in cgis while the oncogenes possess a relatively high number of cpg sites not associated to cgis. in all hpvs, e2/e <dig> is the only region with at least one cgi and shows a higher content of cpg sites in every hpv type with an identified e <dig>  the mucosal hr-hpvs show either the shortest cgi size, followed by the mucosal lr-hpvs and lastly by the cutaneous viral subgroup, and a trend to the lowest cgi number, followed by the cutaneous viral subgroup and lastly by the mucosal lr-hpvs.
