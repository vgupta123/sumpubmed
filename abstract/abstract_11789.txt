BACKGROUND
studying mitosis requires a system in which the dramatic movements of chromosomes and spindle microtubules can be visualized. ptk cells, due to their flat morphology and their small number of large chromosomes, allow microscopic visualizations to be readily performed.


RESULTS
by performing rnai in ptk cells, we can explore the function of many proteins important for spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. although it is difficult to transfect dna into ptk cells , we have transfected a fluorescent sirna at nearly 100% efficiency. using a cdna expression library, we then isolated a complete ptk mcak  cdna. p-mcak shares 81% identity to human-mcak  protein and 66% identity to h-mcak dna. knockdown of p-mcak by rnai caused defects in chromosome congression and defective spindle organization. live imaging revealed that chromosomes had defects in congression and segregation, similar to what we found after microinjection of inhibitory anti-mcak antibodies. because it is laborious to isolate full-length clones, we explored using rt-pcr with degenerate primers to yield cdna fragments from ptk cells from which to design sirnas. we isolated a cdna fragment of the mitotic kinesin eg <dig> from ptk cells. this fragment is 93% identical to h-eg <dig> protein and 87% identical to h-eg <dig> dna. a conserved  <dig> bp sirna was used for rnai in both hela and ptk cells in which eg <dig> knockdown resulted in an increased mitotic index and cells with monopolar spindles. in addition, we used rt-pcr to isolate fragments of  <dig> additional genes, whose sequence identity ranged from  <dig> to 90% with human, mouse, or rat genes, suggesting that this strategy is feasible to apply to any gene of interest.


CONCLUSIONS
this approach will allow us to effectively probe mitotic defects from protein knockdowns by combining genomic information from other organisms with the tractable morphology of ptk cells.
