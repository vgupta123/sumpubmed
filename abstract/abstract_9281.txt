BACKGROUND
pain of mild to moderate grade is difficult to detect in laboratory mice because mice are prey animals that attempt to elude predators or man by hiding signs of weakness, injury or pain. in this study, we investigated the use of telemetry to identify indicators of mild-to-moderate post-laparotomy pain.


RESULTS
adult mice were subjected to laparotomy, either combined with pain treatment  or without pain relief. controls received anesthesia and analgesics or vehicle only. telemetrically measured locomotor activity was undisturbed in all animals, thus confirming that any pain experienced was of the intended mild level. no symptoms of pain were registered in any of the groups by scoring the animals' outer appearance or spontaneous and provoked behavior. in contrast, the group receiving no analgesic treatment after laparotomy demonstrated significant changes in telemetry electrocardiogram recordings: increased heart rate and decreased heart rate variability parameters pointed to sympathetic activation and pain lasting for  <dig> hours. in addition, core body temperature was elevated. body weight and food intake were reduced for  <dig> and  <dig> days, respectively. moreover, unstructured cage territory and destroyed nests appeared for 1â€“ <dig> days in an increased number of animals in this group only. in controls these parameters were not affected.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, real-time telemetric recordings of heart rate and heart rate variability were indicative of mild-to-moderate post-laparotomy pain and could define its duration in our mouse model. this level of pain cannot easily be detected by direct observation.
