BACKGROUND
changes in promoter dna methylation pattern of genes involved in key biological pathways have been reported in glioblastoma. genome-wide assessments of dna methylation levels are now required to decipher the epigenetic events involved in the aggressive phenotype of glioblastoma, and to guide new treatment strategies.


RESULTS
we performed a whole-genome integrative analysis of methylation and gene expression profiles in  <dig> newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients. we also screened for associations between the level of methylation of cpg sites and overall survival in a cohort of  <dig> patients uniformly treated by surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide . the methylation analysis identified  <dig> cpg sites differentially methylated between glioblastoma and control brain, a quarter of which was differentially expressed in a concordant way. thirteen of the genes with concordant cpg sites displayed an inverse correlation between promoter methylation and expression level in glioblastomas: b3gnt <dig>  fabp <dig>  znf <dig>  bst <dig>  oas <dig>  slc13a <dig>  gstm <dig>  me <dig>  ubxd <dig>  tspyl <dig>  faah, c7orf <dig>  and c3orf <dig>  survival analysis identified six cpg sites associated with overall survival. sox <dig> promoter methylation status  stratified patients similarly to mgmt status, but with a higher area under the curve . the methylation status of the fndc3b, tbx <dig>  dgki, and fsd <dig> promoters identified patients with mgmt-methylated tumors that did not respond to stupp treatment .


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides the first genome-wide integrative analysis of dna methylation and gene expression profiles obtained from the same gbm cohort. we also present a methylome-based survival analysis for one of the largest uniformly treated gbm cohort ever studied, for more than  <dig>  cpg sites. we have identified genes whose expression may be tightly regulated by epigenetic mechanisms and markers that may guide treatment decisions.
