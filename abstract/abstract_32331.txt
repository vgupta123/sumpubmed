BACKGROUND
in order to develop a framework for the analysis of sex-biased genes, we present a characterization of microarray data comparing male and female gene expression in  <dig> day chicken embryos for brain, gonad, and heart tissue.


RESULTS
from the  <dig> significantly expressed coding regions that have been assigned to either the autosomes or the z chromosome , roughly 18% were significantly sex-biased in any one tissue, though only  <dig> gene targets were biased in all tissues. the gonad was the most sex-biased tissue, followed by the brain. sex-biased autosomal genes tended to be expressed at lower levels and in fewer tissues than unbiased gene targets, and autosomal somatic sex-biased genes had more expression noise than similar unbiased genes. sex-biased genes linked to the z-chromosome showed reduced expression in females, but not in males, when compared to unbiased z-linked genes, and sex-biased z-linked genes were also expressed in fewer tissues than unbiased z coding regions. third position gc content, and codon usage bias showed some sex-biased effects, primarily for autosomal genes expressed in the gonad. finally, there were several over-represented gene ontology terms in the sex-biased gene sets.


CONCLUSIONS
on the whole, this analysis suggests that sex-biased genes have unique genomic and organismal properties that delineate them from genes that are expressed equally in males and females.
