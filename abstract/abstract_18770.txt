BACKGROUND
complex species-specific, developmental- and tissue-dependent mechanisms regulate alternative splicing of tau, thereby diversifying tau protein synthesis. the functional role of alternative splicing of tau e.g. exon  <dig> has never been examined in vivo, although genetic studies suggest that it is important to neurodegenerative disease.


RESULTS
gene-targeting was used to delete exon  <dig> in murine tau on both alleles  to study its functional role. moreover, mice devoid of exon  <dig>  on one allele were generated to investigate the effects of 1: <dig> balanced expression of 4r-/3r-tau protein, since equal amounts of 4r-/3r-tau protein are synthesized in human brain. middle-aged e10−/− mice displayed sensorimotor disturbances in the rotarod when compared to age-matched e10+/− and wild-type mice, and their muscular grip strength was less than that of e10+/− mice. the performance of e10+/− mice and wild-type mice  was similar in sensorimotor tests. cognitive abilities or anxiety-like behaviours did not depend on exon  <dig> in tau, and neither pathological inclusions nor gene-dependent morphological abnormalities were found.


CONCLUSIONS
ablation of exon  <dig> in the murine tau gene alters alternative splicing and tau protein synthesis which results in mild sensorimotor phenotypes with aging. presumably related microtubule-stabilizing genes rescue other functions.
