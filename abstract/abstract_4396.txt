BACKGROUND
dicer is an rnase iii family endoribonuclease that processes precursor micrornas  and long double-stranded rnas, generating microrna  duplexes and short interfering rna duplexes with 20~ <dig> nucleotides  in length. the typical form of pre-mirna processed by the drosha protein is a hairpin rna with 2-nt 3' overhangs. on the other hand, production of mature mirna from an endogenous hairpin rna with 5' overhangs has also been reported, although the mechanism for this process is unknown.


RESULTS
in this study, we show that human recombinant dicer protein  processes a hairpin rna with 5' overhangs in vitro and generates an intermediate duplex with a  <dig> nt-5' strand and a  <dig> nt-3' strand, which was eventually cleaved into a canonical mirna duplex via a two-step cleavage. the previously identified endogenous pre-mirna with 5' overhangs, pre-mmu-mir- <dig> rna, is also determined to be a substrate of rdicer through the same two-step cleavage.


CONCLUSIONS
the two-step cleavage of a hairpin rna with 5' overhangs shows that dicer releases double-stranded rnas after the first cleavage and binds them again in the inverse direction for a second cleavage. these findings have implications for how dicer may be able to interact with or process differing precursor structures.
