BACKGROUND
tpa induced sequence  <dig> acts as a transcriptional co-regulator controlling the expression of genes involved in differentiation of various cell types, including skeletal myoblasts. we and others have shown that tis <dig> regulates adult myogenesis through myod, one of the essential myogenic regulatory factors.


RESULTS
here, we present data identifying icln as the specific, novel protein downstream of tis <dig> controlling myogenesis. we show that tis7/icln epigenetically regulate myod expression controlling protein methyl transferase activity. in particular, icln regulates myod expression via its interaction with prmt <dig> by an epigenetic modification that utilizes symmetrical di-methylation of histone h <dig> on arginine  <dig>  we provide multiple evidences that tis <dig> directly binds dna, which is a functional feature necessary for its role in transcriptional regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
we present here a molecular insight into tis7-specific control of myod gene expression and thereby skeletal muscle differentiation.
