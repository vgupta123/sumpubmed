BACKGROUND
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease  is a major health problem and a leading cause of chronic liver disease in the united states and western countries. in humans, genetic factors greatly influence individual susceptibility to nafld; nonetheless, the effect of inter-individual differences in the normal liver epigenome with regard to the susceptibility to nafld has not been determined.


RESULTS
in the present study, we investigated the association between the dna methylation status in the livers of a/j and wsb/eij mice and the severity of nafld-associated liver injury. we demonstrate that a/j and wsb/eij mice, which are characterized by significant differences in the severity of liver injury induced by a choline- and folate-deficient  diet exhibit substantial differences in cytosine dna methylation in their normal livers. furthermore, feeding a/j and wsb/eij mice a cfd diet for 12 weeks resulted in different trends and changes in hepatic cytosine dna methylation.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate a primary role of hepatic dna methylation in the pathogenesis of nafld and suggest that individual variations in dna methylation across the genome may be a factor determining and influencing the vulnerability to nafld.
