BACKGROUND
the creation of lymphoblastoid cell lines  through epstein-barr virus  transformation of b-lymphocytes can result in a valuable biomaterial for cell biology research and a renewable source of dna. while lcls have been used extensively in cellular and genetic studies, the process of cell transformation and expansion during culturing may introduce genomic changes that may impact their use and the interpretation of subsequent genetic findings.


RESULTS
we performed whole exome sequencing on a tetrad family using dna derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells  and lcls from each individual. we generated over  <dig>  gb of mappable sequence to a 125x read coverage per sample. an average of  <dig>  genetic variants were identified. comparison of the two dna sources from each individual showed an average concordance rate of  <dig> %. by lowering the variant calling parameters, the concordance rate between the paired samples increased to  <dig> %. sanger sequencing of a subset of the remaining discordant variants did confirm the presence of de novo mutations arising in lcls.


CONCLUSIONS
by varying software stringency parameters, we identified 99% concordance between dna sequences derived from the two different sources from the same donors. these results suggest that lcls are an appropriate representation of the genetic material of the donor and suggest that ebv transformation can result in low-level generation of de novo mutations. therefore, use of pbmc or early passage ebv-transformed cells is recommended. these findings have broad-reaching implications, as there are thousands of lcls in public biorepositories and individual laboratories.
