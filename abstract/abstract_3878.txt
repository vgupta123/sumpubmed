BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small rna molecules that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. recent studies have suggested that mirnas and transcription factors are primary metazoan gene regulators; however, the crosstalk between them still remains unclear.

methods
we proposed a novel model utilizing functional annotation information to identify significant coregulation between transcriptional and post-transcriptional layers. based on this model, function-enriched coregulation relationships were discovered and combined into different kinds of functional coregulation networks.


RESULTS
we found that mirnas may engage in a wider diversity of biological processes by coordinating with transcription factors, and this kind of cross-layer coregulation may have higher specificity than intra-layer coregulation. in addition, the coregulation networks reveal several types of network motifs, including feed-forward loops and massive upstream crosstalk. finally, the expression patterns of these coregulation pairs in normal and tumour tissues were analyzed. different coregulation types show unique expression correlation trends. more importantly, the disruption of coregulation may be associated with cancers.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings elucidate the combinatorial and cooperative properties of transcription factors and mirnas regulation, and we proposes that the coordinated regulation may play an important role in many biological processes.
