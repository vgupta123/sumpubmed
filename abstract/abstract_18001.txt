BACKGROUND
although microbiota play a critical role in the normal development and function of host immune systems, the underlying mechanisms, especially those involved in the large intestine , remain unknown. in the present study, we performed transcriptome analysis of the li of germ-free  and specific pathogen-free  mice of the iqi strain, an inbred strain established from icr mice.


RESULTS
genechip analysis, quantitative real-time rt-pcr, and reconfirmation using bacteria-inoculated gf mice revealed differences in the expression levels of several immune-related genes, such as cryptdin-related sequences , certain subsets of type  <dig> interferon -related genes, class ib mhc molecules, and certain complements. li expressed no authentic cryptdins but predominantly expressed crs <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the mrna levels of ifn-related genes, including irf <dig>  isgf3g, ifit <dig> and stat <dig>  were lower in spf- and flora-reconstituted mice. when an oral ifn-α inducer tilorone analog, r11567da, was administered to spf mice, ifn-α was induced rapidly in the li at  <dig> h, whereas no ifn-α protein was detected in the small intestine  or blood. in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry suggested that the ifn-α production originated from paneth cells in the si, and portions of lamina proprial cd11b- or mpdca1-positive cells in the li.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study suggests that microbial colonization, while inducing the expression of anti-microbial peptides, results in the down-regulation of certain genes responsible for immune responses, especially for type i ifn synthesis. this may reflect the adaptation process of the immune system in the li to prevent excessive inflammation with respect to continuous microbial exposure. further, the repertoire of anti-microbial peptides and the extraordinary role of interferon producing cells in the li have been found to be distinct from those in the si.
