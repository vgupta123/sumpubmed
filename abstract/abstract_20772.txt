BACKGROUND
inference of evolutionary trees using the maximum likelihood principle is np-hard. therefore, all practical methods rely on heuristics. the topological transformations often used in heuristics are nearest neighbor interchange , subtree prune and regraft  and tree bisection and reconnection . however, these topological transformations often fall easily into local optima, since there are not many trees accessible in one step from any given tree. another more exhaustive topological transformation is p-edge contraction and refinement . however, due to its high computation complexity, p-ecr has rarely been used in practice.


RESULTS
to make the p-ecr move more efficient, this paper proposes a new method named p-ecrnj. the main idea of p-ecrnj is to use neighbor joining  to refine the unresolved nodes produced in p-ecr.


CONCLUSIONS
experiments with real datasets show that p-ecrnj can find better trees than the best known maximum likelihood methods so far and can efficiently improve local topological transforms in reasonable time.
