BACKGROUND
the nucleolus is a multi-domain enriched with proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, cell cycle and apoptosis control, viral replication and differentiation of stem cells. several authors have suggested a role for the nucleolus also in malignant transformation. we have recently demonstrated that under specific circumstances the transcriptional factor egr <dig> is shuttled to the nucleolus where it functions as a negative regulator of rna polymerase i. since this activity is hampered in arf −/− cells, and arf transcription is regulated by egr <dig> while the turnover of arf protein is under the control of b <dig>  we speculated that some sort of cooperation between egr <dig> and b <dig> might also exist.


RESULTS
in this work we identified a canonical egr <dig> binding site on the b <dig> promoter through experiments of transactivation and in vitro dna binding assay. we then found that the levels of b <dig> expression are directly correlated with those of egr <dig>  and that this correlation applies to several cellular types and to different stress conditions. furthermore, we showed that egr <dig> stability and accumulation within the nucleolus is in turn regulated by b <dig> through proteasome involvement, similarly to arf turnover.


CONCLUSIONS
our results highlight egr <dig> as a regulator of b <dig> expression actively playing within the newly discovered nucleolar b23-arf-egr <dig> network.
