BACKGROUND
previously, we have reported the ability of thiamine  to induce resistance against plasmopara viticola in a susceptible grapevine cv. chardonnay. however, mechanisms underlying vitamins, especially, thiamine-induced disease resistance in grapevine are still largely unknown. here, we assessed whether thiamine could modulate phenylpropanoid pathway-derived phytoalexins in grapevine plants, as well as, the role of such secondary metabolites in thiamine-induced resistance process to p. viticola.


RESULTS
our data show that thiamine treatment elicited the expression of phenylpropanoid pathway genes in grapevine plants. the expression of these genes correlated with an accumulation of stilbenes, phenolic compounds, flavonoids and lignin. furthermore, the total anti-oxidant potential of thiamine-treaded plants was increased by  <dig> -fold higher level as compared with untreated-control plants. four phenolic compounds are responsible of 97% of the total anti-oxidant potential of thiamine-treated plants. among these compounds, is the caftaric acid, belonging to the hydroxy-cinnamic acids family. this element contributed, by its own, by 20% of this total anti-oxidant potential. epifluorescence microscopy analysis revealed a concomitant presence of unbranched-altered p. viticola mycelia and stilbenes production in the leaf mesophyll of thiamine-treated inoculated plants, suggesting that stilbenes are an important component of thiamine-induced resistance in grapevine.


CONCLUSIONS
this work is the first to show the role of thiamine, as a vitamin, in the modulation of grapevine plant secondary metabolism contributing to an enhanced resistance to p. viticola, the most destructive fungal disease in vineyards.
