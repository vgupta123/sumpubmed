BACKGROUND
cdk <dig> is a component of the mediator complex which facilitates transcription by rna polymerase ii and has been shown to play an important role in development of dictyostelium discoideum. this eukaryote feeds as single cells but starvation triggers the formation of a multicellular organism in response to extracellular pulses of camp and the eventual generation of spores. strains in which the gene encoding cdk <dig> have been disrupted fail to form multicellular aggregates unless supplied with exogenous pulses of camp and later in development, cdk8- cells show a defect in spore production.


RESULTS
microarray analysis revealed that the cdk8- strain previously described  contained genome duplications. regeneration of the strain in a background lacking detectable gene duplication generated strains  with identical defects in growth and early development, but a milder defect in spore generation, suggesting that the severity of this defect depends on the genetic background. the failure of cdk8- cells to aggregate unless rescued by exogenous pulses of camp is consistent with a failure to express the catalytic subunit of protein kinase a. however, overexpression of the gene encoding this protein was not sufficient to rescue the defect, suggesting that this is not the only important target for cdk <dig> at this stage of development. proteomic analysis revealed two potential targets for cdk <dig> regulation, one regulated post-transcriptionally ) and one transcriptionally ).


CONCLUSIONS
this analysis has confirmed the importance of cdk <dig> at multiple stages of dictyostelium development, although the severity of the defect in spore production depends on the genetic background. potential targets of cdk8-mediated gene regulation have been identified in dictyostelium which will allow the mechanism of cdk <dig> action and its role in development to be determined.
