BACKGROUND
the central role of type iii secretion systems  in bacteria-plant interactions is well established, yet unexpected findings are being uncovered through bacterial genome sequencing. some pseudomonas syringae strains possess an uncharacterized cluster of genes encoding putative components of a second t3ss  in addition to the well characterized hrc <dig> t3ss which is associated with disease lesions in host plants and with the triggering of hypersensitive response in non-host plants. the aim of this study is to perform an in silico analysis of t3ss- <dig>  and to compare it with other known t3sss.


RESULTS
based on phylogenetic analysis and gene organization comparisons, the t3ss- <dig> cluster of the p. syringae pv. phaseolicola strain is grouped with a second t3ss found in the pngr234b plasmid of rhizobium sp. these additional t3ss gene clusters define a subgroup within the rhizobium t3ss family. although, t3ss- <dig> is not distributed as widely as the hrc <dig> t3ss in p. syringae strains, it was found to be constitutively expressed in p. syringae pv phaseolicola through rt-pcr experiments.


CONCLUSIONS
the relatedness of the p. syringae t3ss- <dig> to a second t3ss from the pngr234b plasmid of rhizobium sp., member of subgroup ii of the rhizobial t3ss family, indicates common ancestry and/or possible horizontal transfer events between these species. functional analysis and genome sequencing of more rhizobia and p. syringae pathovars may shed light into why these bacteria maintain a second t3ss gene cluster in their genome.
