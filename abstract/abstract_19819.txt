BACKGROUND
grapevine  is one of the most important and ancient horticultural plants in the world. domesticated about 8– <dig>  years ago in the eurasian region, grapevine evolved from its wild relative  into very diverse and heterozygous cultivated forms. in this work we study grapevine genetic structure in a large sample of cultivated varieties, to interpret the wide diversity at morphological and molecular levels and link it to cultivars utilization, putative geographic origin and historical events.


RESULTS
we analyzed the genetic structure of cultivated grapevine using a dataset of  <dig>  multi-locus genotypes defined by  <dig> microsatellite markers. we used the bayesian approach implemented in the structure program and a hierarchical clustering procedure based on ward’s method to assign individuals to sub-groups. the analysis revealed three main genetic groups defined by human use and geographic origin: a) wine cultivars from western regions, b) wine cultivars from the balkans and east europe, and c) a group mainly composed of table grape cultivars from eastern mediterranean, caucasus, middle and far east countries. a second structure level revealed two additional groups, a geographic group from the iberian peninsula and maghreb, and a group comprising table grapes of recent origins from italy and central europe. a large number of admixed genotypes were also identified. structure clusters regrouped together a large proportion of family-related genotypes. in addition, ward’s method revealed a third level of structure, corresponding either to limited geographic areas, to particular grape use or to family groups created through artificial selection and breeding.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides evidence that the cultivated compartment of vitis vinifera l. is genetically structured. genetic relatedness of cultivars has been shaped mostly by human uses, in combination with a geographical effect. the finding of a large portion of admixed genotypes may be the trace of both large human-mediated exchanges between grape-growing regions throughout history and recent breeding.
