BACKGROUND
epigenetic regulation is necessary for maintaining gene expression patterns in multicellular organisms. the polycomb group  proteins form several complexes with important and deeply conserved epigenetic functions in both the plant and animal kingdoms. one such complex, the polycomb repressive complex  <dig> , is critical to many developmental processes in plants including the regulation of major developmental transitions. in addition, prc <dig> restricts the expression domain of various transcription factor families in arabidopsis, including the class i knox genes and several of the abce class mads box genes. while the functions of these transcription factors are known to be deeply conserved, whether or not their regulation by prc <dig> is similarly conserved remains an open question.


RESULTS
here we use virus-induced gene silencing  to characterize the function of the prc <dig> complex in lateral organ development of aquilegia x coerulea ‘origami’, a member of the lower eudicot order ranunculales. leaves with prc <dig> down-regulation displayed a range of phenotypes including ruffled or curled laminae, additional lobing, and an increased frequency of higher order branching. sepals and petals were also affected, being narrowed, distorted, or, in the case of the sepals, exhibiting partial homeotic transformation. many of the petal limbs also had a particularly intense yellow coloration due to an accumulation of carotenoid pigments. we show that the a. x coerulea floral mads box genes agamous <dig> , apetala3- <dig>  and sepallata <dig>  are up-regulated in many tissues, while expression of the class i knox genes and several candidate genes involved in carotenoid production or degradation are largely unaffected.


CONCLUSIONS
prc <dig> targeting of several floral mads box genes may be conserved in dicots, but other known targets do not appear to be. in the case of the type i knox genes, this may reflect a regulatory shift associated with the evolution of compound leaves.
