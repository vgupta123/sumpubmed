BACKGROUND
rye  belongs to tribe triticeae and is an important temperate cereal. it is one of the parents of man-made species triticale and has been used as a source of agronomically important genes for wheat improvement. the short arm of rye chromosome  <dig> , in particular is rich in useful genes, and as it may increase yield, protein content and resistance to biotic and abiotic stress, it has been introgressed into wheat as the 1bl.1rs translocation. a better knowledge of the rye genome could facilitate rye improvement and increase the efficiency of utilizing rye genes in wheat breeding.


RESULTS
here, we report on bac end sequencing of  <dig>  clones from two 1rs-specific bac libraries. we obtained  <dig>   useful sequences with a cumulative length of  <dig> , <dig> bp and an average read length of  <dig> bp. these sequences represent  <dig> % of 1rs arm. the gc content of the sequenced fraction of 1rs is  <dig> %, and at least 84% of the 1rs arm consists of repetitive dna. we identified transposable element junctions in bess and developed insertion site based polymorphism markers . out of the  <dig> primer pairs tested,  <dig>  were specific for 1rs. we also identified bess carrying microsatellites suitable for development of 1rs-specific ssr markers.


CONCLUSIONS
this work demonstrates the utility of chromosome arm-specific bac libraries for targeted analysis of large triticeae genomes and provides new sequence data from the rye genome and molecular markers for the short arm of rye chromosome  <dig>
