BACKGROUND
endocardiosis is the most common heart disease in dachshunds and is therefore an important cause of cardiac morbidity and death. in recent years we have observed an increasing interest in the development of new genetic and genomic markers of heart disease. the discovery of mirnas circulating in biofluids such as plasma or serum aroused researchers’ interest in using them as potential biomarkers. in the present study we analysed the expression of  <dig> mirnas described in literature as being involved in cardiovascular pathology in the plasma of dogs suffering from endocardiosis.


RESULTS
expression analysis using the real-time pcr method revealed that two out of nine mirnas were significantly downregulated: the expression of mir-30b differed between acvim stage b and stage a  dogs; the expression of mi-133b differed acvim stage c and stage a dogs.  <dig> mirnas  showed a trend of downregulation in the acvim c group. levels of mir- <dig> were the same in healthy and diseased dogs. expression of mir-208a and 208b was not detected.


CONCLUSIONS
mir-30b could be a potential biomarker of acvim stage b heart failure in dachshunds with endocardiosis and mir-133b could be a potential biomarker of acvim stage c. the lack of expression or lack of significant changes in expression in  <dig> mirnas which are potential biomarkers of heart diseases in humans proves that findings from human medicine are not always directly reflected in veterinary medicine.
