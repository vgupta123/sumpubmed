BACKGROUND
fatty acid composition contributes importantly to meat quality and is essential to the nutritional value of the meat. identification of genetic factors underlying levels of fatty acids can be used to breed for pigs with healthier meat. the aim of this study was to conduct genome-wide association studies  to identify qtl regions affecting fatty acid composition in backfat from the pig breeds duroc and landrace.


RESULTS
using data from the axiom porcine 660 k array, we performed gwas on  <dig> duroc and  <dig> landrace boars for fatty acid phenotypes measured by near-infrared spectroscopy  technology . two qtl regions on ssc <dig> and ssc <dig> were identified in duroc for the de novo synthesized fatty acids traits, whereas one qtl on ssc <dig> was detected in landrace for c16:1n- <dig>  the qtl region on ssc <dig> has been reported in previous studies and a putative causative mutation has been suggested in the promoter region of the scd gene. whole genome re-sequencing data was used for genotype imputation and to fine map the ssc <dig> qtl region in norwegian duroc. this effort confirms the location of the qtl on this chromosome as well as suggesting other putative candidate genes in the region. the most significant single nucleotide polymorphisms  located on ssc <dig> explain between  <dig> and 76% of the genetic variance and between  <dig> and 54% of the phenotypic variance for the de novo synthesized fatty acid traits in norwegian duroc. for the qtl region on ssc <dig> in landrace, the most significant snp explained 19% of the genetic variance and 5% of the phenotypic variance for c16:1n- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this study confirms a major qtl affecting fatty acid composition on ssc <dig> in duroc, which can be used in genetic selection to increase the level of fatty acid desaturation. the ssc <dig> qtl was not segregating in the landrace population, but another qtl on ssc <dig> affecting c16:1n- <dig> was identified and might be used to increase the level of desaturation in meat products from this breed.
