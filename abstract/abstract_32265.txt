BACKGROUND
many bacteria modulate and evade the immune defenses of their hosts through peptidoglycan  deacetylation. the pg deacetylases from streptococcus pneumonia, listeria monocytogenes and lactococcus lactis have been characterized. however, thus far, the pg deacetylase of mycobacterium tuberculosis has not been identified.


RESULTS
in this study, we cloned the rv <dig> gene from the m. tuberculosis h37rv strain and expressed rv <dig> protein in both escherichia coli and m. smegmatis. the results showed that the purified rv <dig> protein possessed metallo-dependent pg deacetylase activity, which increased in the presence of co2+. the kinetic parameters of the pg deacetylase towards m. smegmatis pg as a substrate were as follows: km,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm; vmax,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmmin-1; and kcat =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . additionally, the viability of m. smegmatis in the presence of over-expressed rv <dig> protein was 109-fold higher than that of wild-type m. smegmatis after lysozyme treatment. additionally, light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy showed that in the presence of over-expressed rv <dig> protein, m. smegmatis kept its regular shape, with an undamaged cell wall and smooth surface. these results indicate that rv <dig> caused deacetylation of cell wall pg, leading to lysozyme resistance in m. smegmatis.


CONCLUSIONS
we have determined that m. tuberculosis rv <dig> is a pg deacetylase. the pg deacetylase activity of rv <dig> contributed to lysozyme resistance in m. smegmatis. our findings suggest that deacetylation of cell wall pg may be involved in evasion of host immune defenses by m. tuberculosis.
