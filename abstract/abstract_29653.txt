BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica serovar pullorum  causes pullorum disease , a severe systemic disease of poultry and results in considerable economic losses in developing countries. in order to develop a safe and immunogenic vaccine, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of s06004Δspi <dig>  a salmonella pathogenicity island  <dig>  deleted mutant of s. pullorum was evaluated in 2-day old chickens.


RESULTS
single intramuscular vaccination with s06004Δspi <dig>  of chickens revealed no differences in body weight or clinical symptoms compared to control group. s06004Δspi <dig> bacteria can colonize and persistent in liver and spleen of vaccinated chickens approximately 14 days, and specific humoral and cellular immune responses were significantly induced. vaccination of chickens offered efficient protection against s. pullorum strain s <dig> and s. gallinarum strain sg <dig> challenge, respectively, at 10 days post vaccination  based on mortality and clinical symptoms compared to control group.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that s06004Δspi <dig> appears to be a highly immunogenic and efficient live attenuated vaccine candidate.
