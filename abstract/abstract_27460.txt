BACKGROUND
interactions between hosts and parasites can be substantially modulated by host nutrition. polyunsaturated fatty acids  are essential dietary nutrients; they are indispensable as structural components of cell membranes and as precursors for eicosanoids, signalling molecules which act on reproduction and immunity. here, we explored the potential of dietary pufas to affect the course of parasitic infections using a well-established invertebrate host – parasite system, the freshwater herbivore daphnia magna and its bacterial parasite pasteuria ramosa.


RESULTS
using natural food sources differing in their pufa composition and by experimentally modifying the availability of dietary arachidonic acid  and eicosapentaenoic acid  we examined pufa-mediated effects resulting from direct consumption as well as maternal effects on offspring of treated mothers. we found that both host and parasite were affected by food quality. feeding on c <dig> pufa-containing food sources resulted in higher offspring production of hosts and these effects were conveyed to a great extent to the next generation. while feeding on a diet containing high pufa concentrations significantly reduced the likelihood of becoming infected, the infection success in the next generation increased whenever the maternal diet contained pufas. we suggest that this opposing effect was caused by a trade-off between reproduction and immunity in the second generation.


CONCLUSIONS
considering the direct and maternal effects of dietary pufas on host and parasite we propose that host – parasite interactions and thus disease dynamics under natural conditions are subject to the availability of dietary pufas.
