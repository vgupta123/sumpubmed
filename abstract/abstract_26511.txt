BACKGROUND
toxic substances like heavy metals can inhibit and disrupt the normal embryonic development of organisms. exposure to platinum during embryogenesis has been shown to lead to a “one fell swoop” internalization of the shell in the ramshorn snail marisa cornuarietis, an event which has been discussed to be possibly indicative of processes in evolution which may result in dramatic changes in body plans.


RESULTS
whereas at usual cultivation temperature, 26°c, platinum inhibits the growth of both shell gland and mantle edge during embryogenesis leading to an internalization of the mantle and, thus, also of the shell, higher temperatures induce a re-start of the differential growth of the mantle edge and the shell gland after a period of inactivity. here, developing embryos exhibit a broad spectrum of shell forms: in some individuals only the ventral part of the visceral sac is covered while others develop almost “normal” shells. histological studies and scanning electron microscopy images revealed platinum to inhibit the differential growth of the shell gland and the mantle edge, and elevated temperature  to mitigate this platinum effect with varying efficiency.


CONCLUSIONS
we could show that the formation of internal, external, and intermediate shells is realized within the continuum of a developmental gradient defined by the degree of differential growth of the embryonic mantle edge and shell gland. the artificially induced internal and intermediate shells are first external and then partly internalized, similar to internal shells found in other molluscan groups.
