BACKGROUND
molecular probes are required to detect cell wall polymers in-situ to aid understanding of their cell biology and several studies have shown that cell wall epitopes have restricted occurrences across sections of plant organs indicating that cell wall structure is highly developmentally regulated. xyloglucan is the major hemicellulose or cross-linking glycan of the primary cell walls of dicotyledons although little is known of its occurrence or functions in relation to cell development and cell wall microstructure.


RESULTS
using a neoglycoprotein approach, in which a xxxg heptasaccharide of tamarind seed xyloglucan was coupled to bsa to produce an immunogen, we have generated a rat monoclonal antibody  to the xxxg structural motif of xyloglucans. the specificity of lm <dig> has been confirmed by the analysis of lm <dig> binding using glycan microarrays and oligosaccharide hapten inhibition of binding studies. the use of lm <dig> for the analysis of xyloglucan in the cell walls of tamarind and nasturtium seeds, in which xyloglucan occurs as a storage polysaccharide, indicated that the lm <dig> xyloglucan epitope occurs throughout the thickened cell walls of the tamarind seed and in the outer regions, adjacent to middle lamellae, of the thickened cell walls of the nasturtium seed. immunofluorescence analysis of lm <dig> binding to sections of tobacco and pea stem internodes indicated that the xyloglucan epitope was restricted to a few cell types in these organs. enzymatic removal of pectic homogalacturonan from equivalent sections resulted in the abundant detection of distinct patterns of the lm <dig> xyloglucan epitope across these organs and a diversity of occurrences in relation to the cell wall microstructure of a range of cell types.


CONCLUSIONS
these observations support ideas that xyloglucan is associated with pectin in plant cell walls. they also indicate that documented patterns of cell wall epitopes in relation to cell development and cell differentiation may need to be re-considered in relation to the potential masking of cell wall epitopes by other cell wall components.
