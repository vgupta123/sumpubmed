BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori causes acute and chronic gastric inflammation induced by proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines secreted by cells of the gastric mucosa, including gastric epithelial cells. previous studies have demonstrated that the bacterial arginase, rocf, is involved in inhibiting t cell proliferation and cd3Î¶ expression, suggesting that arginase could be involved in a more general dampening of the immune response, perhaps by down-regulation of certain pro-inflammatory mediators.


RESULTS
global transcriptome analysis was performed on ags gastric epithelial cells infected for  <dig> hours with a wild type helicobacter pylori strain  <dig>  an arginase mutant  or a rocf+ complemented strain. h. pylori infection triggered altered host gene expression in genes involved in cell movement, death/growth/proliferation, and cellular function and maintenance. while the wild type strain stimulates host inflammatory pathways, the rocf- mutant induced significantly more expression of il- <dig>  the results of the microarray were verified using real-time pcr, and the differential levels of protein expression were confirmed by elisa and bioplex analysis. mip-1b was also significantly secreted by ags cells after h. pylori rocf- mutant infection, as determined by bioplex. even though not explored in this manuscript, the impact that the results presented here may have on the development of gastritis, warrant further research to understand the underlying mechanisms of the relationship between h. pylori rocf and il- <dig> induction.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that h. pylori arginase modulates multiple host signaling and metabolic pathways of infected gastric epithelial cells. arginase may play a critical role in anti-inflammatory host responses that could contribute to the ability of h. pylori to establish chronic infections.
