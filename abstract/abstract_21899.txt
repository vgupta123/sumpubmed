BACKGROUND
with both shrimp and commercial insects such as honey bees, it is known that stable, persistent viral infections characterized by absence of disease can sometimes shift to overt disease states as a result of various stress triggers and that this can result in serious economic losses. the main research interest of our group is to understand the dynamics of stable viral infections in shrimp and how they can be destabilized by stress. since there are no continuous cell lines for crustaceans, we have used a c6/ <dig> mosquito cell line infected with dengue virus to test hypotheses regarding these interactions. as a result, we accidentally discovered two new cytokine-like substances in  <dig> kda extracts from supernatant solutions of acutely and persistently infected mosquito cells.


RESULTS
naïve c6/ <dig> cells were exposed for  <dig> h to  <dig> kda membrane filtrates prepared from the supernatant medium of stable c6/ <dig> mosquito cell cultures persistently-infected with dengue virus. subsequent challenge of naïve cells with a virulent stock of dengue virus  <dig>  and analysis by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-den- <dig> antibody revealed a dramatic reduction in the percentage of den- <dig> infected cells when compared to control cells. similar filtrates prepared from c6/ <dig> cells with acute den- <dig> infections were used to treat stable c6/ <dig> mosquito cell cultures persistently-infected with dengue virus. confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed destabilization in the form of an apoptosis-like response. proteinase k treatment removed the cell-altering activities indicating that they were caused by small polypeptides similar to those previously reported from insects.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of cytokine-like substances that can alter the responses of mosquito cells to dengue virus. this simple model system allows detailed molecular studies on insect cytokine production and on cytokine activity in a standard insect cell line.
