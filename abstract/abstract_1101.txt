BACKGROUND
haemophilus ducreyi, the causative agent of the sexually transmitted disease chancroid, contains a flp  operon that encodes proteins predicted to contribute to adherence and pathogenesis. h. ducreyi mutants that lack expression of flp <dig> and flp <dig> or tada, which has homology to ntpases of type iv secretion systems, have decreased abilities to attach to and form microcolonies on human foreskin fibroblasts . a tada mutant is attenuated in its ability to cause disease in human volunteers and in the temperature dependent rabbit model, but a flp1flp <dig> mutant is virulent in rabbits. whether a flp deletion mutant would cause disease in humans is not clear.


RESULTS
we constructed 35000hpΔflp1- <dig>  a deletion mutant that lacks expression of all three flp proteins but has an intact tad secretion system. 35000hpΔflp1- <dig> was impaired in its ability to form microcolonies and to attach to hff in vitro when compared to its parent . complementation of the mutant with flp1- <dig> in trans restored the parental phenotype. to test whether expression of flp1- <dig> was necessary for virulence in humans, ten healthy adult volunteers were experimentally infected with a fixed dose of 35000hp  on one arm and three doses of 35000hpΔflp1- <dig>  on the other arm. the overall papule formation rate for the parent was 80%  and for the mutant was  <dig> %  . mutant papules were significantly smaller  than were parent papules   <dig> h after inoculation . the overall pustule formation rates were  <dig> %  at  <dig> parent sites and  <dig> %  at  <dig> mutant sites .


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that production and secretion of the flp proteins contributes to microcolony formation and attachment to hff cells in vitro. expression of flp1- <dig> is also necessary for h. ducreyi to initiate disease and progress to pustule formation in humans. future studies will focus on how flp proteins contribute to microcolony formation and attachment in vivo.
