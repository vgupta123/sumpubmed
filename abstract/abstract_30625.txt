BACKGROUND
botrytis cinerea is a haploid necrotrophic ascomycete which is responsible for 'grey mold' disease in more than  <dig> plant species. broad molecular research has been conducted on this pathogen in recent years, resulting in the sequencing of two strains, which has generated a wealth of information toward developing additional tools for molecular transcriptome, proteome and secretome investigations. nonetheless, transformation protocols have remained a significant bottleneck for this pathogen, hindering functional analysis research in many labs.


RESULTS
in this study, we tested three different transformation methods for b. cinerea: electroporation, air-pressure-mediated and sclerotium-mediated transformation. we demonstrate successful transformation with three different dna constructs using both air-pressure- and sclerotium-mediated transformation.


CONCLUSIONS
these transformation methods, which are fast, simple and reproducible, can expedite functional gene analysis of b. cinerea.
