BACKGROUND
in rice, the major part of the post-embryonic root system is made of stem-derived roots named crown roots . among the few characterized rice mutants affected in root development, crown rootless <dig> mutant is unable to initiate crown root primordia. crown rootless <dig>  is induced by auxin and encodes an as2/lob-domain transcription factor that acts upstream of the gene regulatory network controlling cr development.


RESULTS
to identify genes involved in cr development, we compared global gene expression profile in stem bases of crl <dig> mutant and wild-type  plants. our analysis revealed that  <dig> and  <dig> genes are down- and up-regulated respectively in the crl <dig> mutant. auxin induces crl <dig> expression and consequently it is expected that auxin also alters the expression of genes that are early regulated by crl <dig>  to identify genes under the early control of crl <dig>  we monitored the expression kinetics of a selected subset of genes, mainly chosen among those exhibiting differential expression, in crl <dig> and wt following exogenous auxin treatment. this analysis revealed that most of these genes, mainly related to hormone, water and nutrient, development and homeostasis, were likely not regulated directly by crl <dig>  we hypothesized that the differential expression for these genes observed in the crl <dig> mutant is likely a consequence of the absence of cr formation. otherwise, three crl1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: fsm /fas <dig> , gte <dig>  and map  were identified. fsm/fas <dig> and gte <dig> are known in rice and arabidopsis to be involved in the maintenance of root meristem through chromatin remodelling and cell cycle regulation respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
our data showed that the differential regulation of most genes in crl <dig> versus wt may be an indirect consequence of crl <dig> inactivation resulting from the absence of cr in the crl <dig> mutant. nevertheless some genes, fas1/fsm, gte <dig> and map, require crl <dig> to be induced by auxin suggesting that they are likely directly regulated by crl <dig>  these genes have a function related to polarized cell growth, cell cycle regulation or chromatin remodelling. this suggests that these genes are controlled by crl <dig> and involved in cr initiation in rice.
