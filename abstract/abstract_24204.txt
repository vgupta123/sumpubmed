BACKGROUND
deidentified newborn screening bloodspot samples  represent a valuable potential resource for genomic research if impediments to whole exome sequencing of nbs deoxyribonucleic acid , including the small amount of genomic dna in nbs material, can be overcome. for instance, genomic analysis of nbs could be used to define allele frequencies of disease-associated variants in local populations, or to conduct prospective or retrospective studies relating genomic variation to disease emergence in pediatric populations over time. in this study, we compared the recovery of variant calls from exome sequences of amplified nbs genomic dna to variant calls from exome sequencing of non-amplified nbs dna from the same individuals.


RESULTS
using a standard alignment-based genome analysis toolkit , we find  <dig> – <dig>  additional variants in amplified samples. after application of a unique kmer enumeration and variant detection method , only  <dig> – <dig>  additional variants are observed in amplified gdna. this result suggests that roughly half of the amplification-introduced variants identified using gatk may be the result of mapping errors and read misalignment.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that it is possible to obtain informative, high-quality data from exome analysis of whole genome amplified nbs with the important caveat that different data generation and analysis methods can affect variant detection accuracy, and the concordance of variant calls in whole-genome amplified and non-amplified exomes.
