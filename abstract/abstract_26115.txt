BACKGROUND
the incidence of invasive disease caused by encapsulated haemophilus influenzae type f  has increased in the post-h. influenzae type b  vaccine era. we previously annotated the first complete hif genome from a clinical isolate  that caused septic shock and necrotizing myositis. here, the full genome of hif kr <dig> was compared to sequenced reference strains hib  <dig>  capsule type d  rd kw <dig>  and finally nontypeable h. influenzae  <dig>  the goal was to identify possible genomic characteristics that may shed light upon the pathogenesis of hif.


RESULTS
the hif kr <dig> genome exhibited large regions of synteny with other h. influenzae, but also distinct genome rearrangements. a predicted hif core genome of  <dig> genes was shared with the reference strains, and  <dig> unique genomic regions comprising half of the  <dig> unique coding sequences were revealed. the majority of these regions were inserted genetic fragments, most likely derived from the closely-related haemophilus spp. including h. aegyptius, h. haemolyticus and h. parainfluenzae. importantly, the kr <dig> genome possessed several putative virulence genes that were distinct from non-type f strains. these included the sap <dig> operon, aef <dig> fimbriae, and genes for kanamycin nucleotidyltranserase, iron-utilization proteins, and putative yada-like trimeric autotransporters that may increase the bacterial virulence. furthermore, hif kr <dig> lacked a hisabcdefgh operon for de novo histidine biosynthesis, hmg locus for lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis and biofilm formation, the haemophilus antibiotic resistance island and a haemophilus secondary molybdate transport system. we confirmed the histidine auxotrophy and kanamycin resistance in hif by functional experiments. moreover, the pattern of unique or missing genes of hif kr <dig> was similar in  <dig> hif clinical isolates obtained from different years and geographical areas. a cross-species comparison revealed that the hif genome shared more characteristics with h. aegyptius than hid and nthi.


CONCLUSIONS
the genomic comparative analyses facilitated identification of genotypic characteristics that may be related to the specific virulence of hif. in relation to non-type f h. influenzae strains, the hif genome contains differences in components involved in metabolism and survival that may contribute to its invasiveness.
