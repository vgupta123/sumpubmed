BACKGROUND
ap <dig> is a prominent adhesin of trichomonas vaginalis that mediates binding of parasites to host vaginal epithelial cells . ap <dig> with no secretion signal sequence, membrane targeting peptide, and anchoring motif was recently found to be secreted.


RESULTS
we first wanted to demonstrate surface association of ap <dig> to the parasite followed by the identification of the binding epitope interacting with both organisms and vecs. ap <dig> was found to bind to trichomonads, but not to trypsin-treated parasites, in an auto-ligand assay, suggesting the existence of a surface protein associating with ap <dig>  since rabbit antiserum igg antibodies reactive with epitopes localized to the n-terminal region of ap <dig> inhibit the attachment of live parasites to vecs, we hypothesized that the binding domain was localized to this region. we subcloned five overlapping fragments of ap <dig> called c <dig> through c <dig>  and expression of recombinant clones was confirmed with antibodies to ap <dig>  each purified recombinant protein was then tested for binding activity using an established ligand assay, and fragment c <dig> with the first twenty-five amino acids in the n-terminal domain was required for binding to vecs and, surprisingly, also to parasites. importantly, c <dig> competed with the binding of ap <dig> to both cells types.


CONCLUSIONS
t. vaginalis ap <dig> is a secreted, surface-associated protein and a model is proposed to explain how this secreted protein functions as an adhesin.
