BACKGROUND
the centrosome is the cell's microtubule organising centre, an organelle with important roles in cell division, migration and polarity. however, cells can divide and flies can, for a large part of development, develop without them. many centrosome proteins have been identified but the roles of most are still poorly understood. the centrioles of the centrosome are similar to the basal bodies of cilia, hair-like extensions of many cells that have important roles in cell signalling and development. in a number of human diseases, such bardet-biedl syndrome, centrosome/cilium proteins are mutated, leading to polycystic kidney disease, situs inversus, and neurological problems, amongst other symptoms.


RESULTS
we describe zebrafish  embryos depleted for two uncharacterised, centrosome proteins, cep <dig> and cep <dig>  the phenotype of these embryos resembles that of zebrafish mutants for intraflagellar transport proteins , with kidney and ear development affected and left-right asymmetry randomised. these organs and processes are those affected in bardet-biedl syndrome and other similar diseases. like these diseases, the root cause of the phenotype lies, in fact, in dysfunctional cilia, which are shortened but not eliminated in several tissues in the morphants. centrosomes and basal bodies, on the other hand, are present. both cep <dig> and cep <dig> possess a putative hdac  interacting domain. however, we could not detect in yeast two-hybrid assays any interaction with the deacetylase that controls cilium length, hdac <dig>  or any of the ifts that we tested.


CONCLUSIONS
cep <dig> and cep <dig> contribute to ciliogenesis in many tissues in the zebrafish embryo: cilia are made in cep <dig> and cep <dig> morphant zebrafish embryos but are shortened. we propose that the role of these centrosomal/basal body proteins is in making the cilium and that they are involved in determination of the length of the axoneme.
