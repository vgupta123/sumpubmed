BACKGROUND
the fermented dried seeds of theobroma cacao  are the main ingredient in chocolate. world cocoa production was estimated to be  <dig> million tons in  <dig> with an annual estimated average growth rate of  <dig> %. the cacao bean production industry is currently under threat from a rise in fungal diseases including black pod, frosty pod, and witches' broom. in order to address these issues, genome-sequencing efforts have been initiated recently to facilitate identification of genetic markers and genes that could be utilized to accelerate the release of robust t. cacao cultivars. however, problems inherent with assembly and resolution of distal regions of complex eukaryotic genomes, such as gaps, chimeric joins, and unresolvable repeat-induced compressions, have been unavoidably encountered with the sequencing strategies selected.


RESULTS
here, we describe the construction of a bac-based integrated genetic-physical map of the t. cacao cultivar matina 1- <dig> which is designed to augment and enhance these sequencing efforts. three bac libraries, each comprised of 10Ã— coverage, were constructed and fingerprinted.  <dig> genetic markers from a high-resolution genetic recombination map and  <dig> arabidopsis-derived conserved ortholog set  ii markers were anchored using pooled overgo hybridization. a dense tile path consisting of  <dig>  bacs was selected and end-sequenced. the physical map consists of  <dig> contigs and  <dig>  singletons. forty-nine contigs are genetically anchored and ordered to chromosomes for a total span of  <dig>  mbp. the unanchored contigs  span  <dig>  mbp and therefore the estimated genome size of t. cacao is  <dig>  mbp. a comparative analysis with a. thaliana, v. vinifera, and p. trichocarpa suggests that comparisons of the genome assemblies of these distantly related species could provide insights into genome structure, evolutionary history, conservation of functional sites, and improvements in physical map assembly. a comparison between the two t. cacao cultivars matina 1- <dig> and criollo indicates a high degree of collinearity in their genomes, yet rearrangements were also observed.


CONCLUSIONS
the results presented in this study are a stand-alone resource for functional exploitation and enhancement of theobroma cacao but are also expected to complement and augment ongoing genome-sequencing efforts. this resource will serve as a template for refinement of the t. cacao genome through gap-filling, targeted re-sequencing, and resolution of repetitive dna arrays.
