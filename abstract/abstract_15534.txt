BACKGROUND
eventing is generally recognized as a challenging equestrian discipline and wastage figures for this discipline are relatively high. there is a need for information that provides insight into the causes of wastage and withdrawal from competition, for animal welfare and economic reasons. the aim of the present investigation was to conduct a prospective study following the entire national selection of event horses  and ponies  in the netherlands that prepared for the european championship in  <dig>  and  <dig> , noting causes of withdrawal and monitoring fitness using standardized exercise tests , with heart rate , speed  and plasma lactate concentrations  as measured parameters.


RESULTS
in set-i, performed at the beginning of the season, horses  had a mean vla <dig>  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  m/s with a mean v <dig>  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  m/s and ponies  a mean vla <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  m/s and v <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  m/s. before set-ii, performed six weeks before the european championship, 16/ <dig> horses and 6/ <dig> ponies were withdrawn. the most common reason for withdrawal was locomotor injury . other reasons included an animal ‘not meeting the competition criteria’  and being sold . animals were divided on the basis of vla <dig> and recovery-hr during set-i into good and average performers. average performers were significantly more likely to be injured  than good performers . in a subpopulation of ten horses, in which all condition training sessions were evaluated for hr and speed, hrpeak was significantly lower in horses that stayed sound  compared with horses withdrawn from training and competition because of injury .


CONCLUSIONS
of the national selection, 45% of all animals were unavailable for the european championship because of locomotor injuries. field tests were useful in assessing the potential injury risk, as individuals with better fitness indices  were less likely to become injured than average performers. furthermore, monitoring of training sessions showed predictive value for future injuries, as horses withdrawn because of injury later on showed already higher peak hrs during condition training than horses that stayed sound. therefore the increase in peak hr seemed to precede visible lameness in a horse.
