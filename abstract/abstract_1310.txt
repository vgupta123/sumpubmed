BACKGROUND
lotus is a diploid plant with agricultural, medicinal, and ecological significance. genetic linkage maps are fundamental resources for genome and genetic study, and also provide molecular markers for breeding in agriculturally important species. genotyping by sequencing revolutionized genetic mapping, the restriction-site associated dna sequencing  allowed rapid discovery of thousands of snps markers, and a crucial aspect of the sequence based mapping strategy is the reference sequences used for marker identification.


RESULTS
we assessed the effectiveness of linkage mapping using three types of references for scoring markers: the unmasked genome, repeat masked genome, and gene models. overall, the repeat masked genome produced the optimal genetic maps. a high-density genetic map of american lotus was constructed using an f <dig> population derived from a cross between nelumbo nucifera ‘china antique’ and n. lutea ‘al1’. a total of  <dig>  radseq markers were used to construct the american lotus ‘al1’ genetic map, and  <dig> markers were used to construct the chinese lotus ‘china antique’ genetic map. the american lotus map has  <dig> linkage groups, and spans  <dig>  cm, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. the american lotus map was used to anchor scaffold sequences in the n. nucifera ‘china antique’ draft genome.  <dig>  radseq markers anchored  <dig> individual scaffold sequences into  <dig> megascaffolds spanning 67% of the 804 mb draft genome.


CONCLUSIONS
among the unmasked genome, repeat masked genome and gene models, the optimal reference sequences to call radseq markers for map construction is repeat masked genome. this high density genetic map is a valuable resource for genomic research and crop improvement in lotus.
