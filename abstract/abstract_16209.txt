BACKGROUND
brd <dig> belongs to the bromodomain-extraterminal domain  family of transcriptional co-regulators, and functions as a pivotal histone-directed recruitment scaffold in chromatin modification complexes affecting signal-dependent transcription. brd <dig> facilitates expression of genes promoting proliferation and is implicated in apoptosis and in egg maturation and meiotic competence in mammals; it is also a susceptibility gene for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy  in humans. the brd <dig> ortholog in drosophila is a maternal effect, embryonic lethal gene that regulates several homeotic loci, including ultrabithorax. despite its importance, there are few systematic studies of brd <dig> developmental expression in any organism. to help elucidate both conserved and novel gene functions, we cloned and characterized expression of brd <dig> cdnas in zebrafish, a vertebrate system useful for genetic analysis of development and disease, and for study of the evolution of gene families and functional diversity in chordates.


RESULTS
we identify cdnas representing two paralogous brd <dig> loci in zebrafish, brd2a on chromosome  <dig> and brd2b on chromosome  <dig>  by sequence similarity, syntenic and phylogenetic analyses, we present evidence for structural divergence of brd <dig> after gene duplication in fishes. brd <dig> paralogs show potential for modular domain combinations, and exhibit distinct rna expression patterns throughout development. rna in situ hybridizations in oocytes and embryos implicate brd2a and brd2b as maternal effect genes involved in egg polarity and egg to embryo transition, and as zygotic genes important for development of the vertebrate nervous system and for morphogenesis and differentiation of the digestive tract. patterns of brd <dig> developmental expression in zebrafish are consistent with its proposed role in homeobox gene regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
expression profiles of zebrafish brd <dig> paralogs support a role in vertebrate developmental patterning and morphogenesis. our study uncovers both maternal and zygotic contributions of brd <dig>  the analysis of which may provide insight into the earliest events in vertebrate development, and the etiology of some forms of epilepsy, for which zebrafish is an important model. knockdowns of brd <dig> paralogs in zebrafish may now test proposed function and interaction with homeotic loci in vertebrates, and help reveal the extent to which functional novelty or partitioning has occurred after gene duplication.
