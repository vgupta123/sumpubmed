BACKGROUND
parainfluenza virus type  <dig>  was isolated from dairy buffaloes  naturally affected with respiratory and reproductive clinical conditions.


RESULTS
examination of nasal and vaginal swabs collected from  <dig> diseased buffaloes led to the isolation of three paramyxovirus isolates from two animals. antigenic, morphological and biological characteristics of these three isolates were essentially similar to those of members of the paramyxoviridae family. antigenic analysis by direct immunofluorescence and cross neutralization test placed these isolates together with bovine parainfluenza virus type  <dig> . nucleotide and amino acid phylogenetic analysis of partial matrix gene sequences of the buffalo isolates and six field bpiv <dig> isolates from bovines in argentina were studied. buffalo isolates were similar to genotype b  while the six bpiv <dig> isolates were similar to genotypes a  and c .


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first characterization of bpiv <dig> in water buffalo.

according to the samples analyzed, in argentina, the genotype b was found in buffalo and the genotypes a and c were found in cattle.
