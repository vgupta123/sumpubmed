BACKGROUND
a thermal tolerant stereo-complex poly-lactic acid  can be made by mixing poly-d-lactic acid  and poly-l-lactic acid  at a defined ratio. this environmentally friendly biodegradable polymer could replace traditional recalcitrant petroleum-based plastics. to achieve this goal, however, it is imperative to produce optically pure lactic acid isomers using a cost-effective substrate such as cellulosic biomass. the roadblock of this process is that: 1) xylose derived from cellulosic biomass is un-fermentable by most lactic acid bacteria; 2) the glucose effect results in delayed and incomplete xylose fermentation. an alternative strain devoid of the glucose effect is needed to co-utilize both glucose and xylose for improved d-lactic acid production using a cellulosic biomass substrate.


RESULTS
a previously engineered l-lactic acid escherichia coli strain, wl <dig> , was reengineered for production of d-lactic acid, by replacing the recombinant l-lactate dehydrogenase gene  with a d-lactate dehydrogenase gene . the glucose effect  of the resulting strain, jh <dig>  was eliminated by deletion of the ptsg gene which encodes for iibcglc . the derived strain, jh <dig>  was metabolically evolved through serial transfers in screw-cap tubes containing glucose. the evolved strain, jh <dig>  regained improved anaerobic cell growth using glucose. in fermentations using a mixture of glucose  and xylose , jh <dig> co-utilized both glucose and xylose, achieving an average sugar consumption rate of  <dig>  g l−1h− <dig>  a d-lactic acid titer of 83 g l− <dig>  and a productivity of  <dig>  g l− <dig> h− <dig>  this result represents a 46 % improved sugar consumption rate, a 26 % increased d-lactic acid titer, and a 48 % enhanced productivity, compared to that achieved by jh <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrated that jh <dig> has the potential for fermentative production of d-lactic acid using cellulosic biomass derived substrates, which contain a mixture of c <dig> and c <dig> sugars.
