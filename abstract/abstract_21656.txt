BACKGROUND
nuclear factor kappa b  is a transcription factor typically expressed with two specific subunits . investigators have reported that nf-κb is activated during the induction of in vitro long term potentiation , a paradigm of synaptic plasticity and correlate of memory, suggesting that nf-κb may be necessary for some aspects of memory encoding. furthermore, nf-κb has been implicated as a potential requirement in behavioral tests of memory. unfortunately, very little work has been done to explore the effects of deleting specific nf-κb subunits on memory. studies have shown that nf-κb p <dig> subunit deletion  leads to memory deficits, however some recent studies suggest the contrary where p50−/− mice show enhanced memory in the morris water maze . to more critically explore the role of the nf-κb p <dig> subunit in synaptic plasticity and memory, we assessed long term spatial memory in vivo using the mwm, and synaptic plasticity in vitro utilizing high frequency stimuli capable of eliciting ltp in slices from the hippocampus of nf-κb p50−/− versus their controls .


RESULTS
we found that the lack of the nf-κb p <dig> subunit led to significant decreases in late ltp and in selective but significant alterations in mwm tests .


CONCLUSIONS
these results support the hypothesis that the nf-κ p <dig> subunit is required in long term spatial memory in the hippocampus.
