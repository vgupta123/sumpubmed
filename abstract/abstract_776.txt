BACKGROUND
the nucleus, a highly organized organelle, plays important role in cellular homeostasis. the nuclear proteins are crucial for chromosomal maintenance/segregation, gene expression, rna processing/export, and many other processes. several methods have been developed for predicting the nuclear proteins in the past. the aim of the present study is to develop a new method for predicting nuclear proteins with higher accuracy.


RESULTS
all modules were trained and tested on a non-redundant dataset and evaluated using five-fold cross-validation technique. firstly, support vector machines  based modules have been developed using amino acid and dipeptide compositions and achieved a mathews correlation coefficient  of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. secondly, we have developed svm modules using split amino acid compositions  and achieved the maximum mcc of  <dig> . thirdly, a hidden markov model  based module/profile was developed for searching exclusively nuclear and non-nuclear domains in a protein. finally, a hybrid module was developed by combining svm module and hmm profile and achieved a mcc of  <dig>  with an accuracy of  <dig> %. this method performs better than the existing methods when evaluated on blind/independent datasets. our method estimated  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the proteins as nuclear proteins in saccharomyces cerevisiae, caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster, mouse and human proteomes respectively. based on the above modules, we have developed a web server nppred for predicting nuclear proteins .


CONCLUSIONS
this study describes a highly accurate method for predicting nuclear proteins. svm module has been developed for the first time using saac for predicting nuclear proteins, where amino acid composition of n-terminus and the remaining protein were computed separately. in addition, our study is a first documentation where exclusively nuclear and non-nuclear domains have been identified and used for predicting nuclear proteins. the performance of the method improved further by combining both approaches together.
