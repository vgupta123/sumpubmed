BACKGROUND
micrornas  are involved in carcinogenesis and tumor progression by regulating post-transcriptional gene expression. however, the mirna-mrna regulatory network is far from being fully understood. the objective of this study is to identify the colorectal cancer  specific mirnas and their target mrnas using a multi-step approach.


RESULTS
a multi-step approach combining microarray mirna and mrna expression profile and bioinformatics analysis was adopted to identify the crc specific mirna-mrna regulatory network. first,  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas and  <dig> mrnas from crc samples and their corresponding normal epithelial tissues were identified by mirna and mrna microarray, respectively. secondly,  <dig> dysregulated mirnas and their  <dig> target mrnas  were identified by a combination of pearsonâ€™s correlation analysis and prediction by databases targetscan and miranda. bioinformatics analysis revealed that these mirna-mrnas pairs were involved in wnt signaling pathway. additionally,  <dig> up-regulated mirnas  and  <dig> down-regulated predicted target mrnas  were selected to validate the expression level and their anti-correlationship in an extended cohort of crc patients by qrt-pcr. except for mir-27a, the differential expression and their anti-correlationship were proven. finally, a transfection assay was performed to validate a regulatory relationship between mir-29a and klf <dig> at both rna and protein levels.


CONCLUSIONS
seventy-two mirna-mrna pairs combined by  <dig> dysregulated mirnas and their  <dig> target mrnas identified by the multi-step approach appear to be involved in crc tumorigenesis. the results in our study were worthwhile to further investigation via a functional study to fully understand the underlying regulatory mechanisms of mirna in crc.
