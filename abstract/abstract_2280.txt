BACKGROUND
graph analysis algorithms such as pagerank and hits have been successful in web environments because they are able to extract important inter-document relationships from manually-created hyperlinks. we consider the application of these techniques to biomedical text retrieval. in the current pubmed® search interface, a medline® citation is connected to a number of related citations, which are in turn connected to other citations. thus, a medline record represents a node in a vast content-similarity network. this article explores the hypothesis that these networks can be exploited for text retrieval, in the same manner as hyperlink graphs on the web.


RESULTS
we conducted a number of reranking experiments using the trec  <dig> genomics track test collection in which scores extracted from pagerank and hits analysis were combined with scores returned by an off-the-shelf retrieval engine. experiments demonstrate that incorporating pagerank scores yields significant improvements in terms of standard ranked-retrieval metrics.


CONCLUSIONS
the link structure of content-similarity networks can be exploited to improve the effectiveness of information retrieval systems. these results generalize the applicability of graph analysis algorithms to text retrieval in the biomedical domain.
