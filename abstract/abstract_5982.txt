BACKGROUND
a great deal is known about the morphological endpoints of plant cell death, but relatively little is known about its sequence of events and / or its execution at the biochemical level. live cell imaging using gfp-tagged markers is a powerful way to provide dynamic portraits of a cellular process that can in turn provide a descriptive foundation valuable for future biochemical and genetic investigations.


RESULTS
while characterizing a collection of random gfp-protein fusion markers we discovered that mechanical wounding induces rapid aggregation of a gfp-nitrilase  <dig> fusion protein in arabidopsis cells directly abutting wound sites. time-lapse imaging of this response shows that the aggregation occurs in cells that subsequently die  <dig> â€“  <dig> minutes post-wounding, indicating that gfp-nit <dig> aggregation is an early marker of cell death at wound sites. time-lapse confocal imaging was used to characterize wound-induced cell death using gfp-nit <dig> and markers of the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum. these analyses provide dynamic portraits of well-known death-associated responses such as nuclear contraction and cellular collapse and reveal novel features such as nuclear envelope separation, er vesiculation and loss of nuclear-lumen contents. as a parallel system for imaging cell death, we developed a chemical method for rapidly triggering cell death using the herbicides bromoxynil or chloroxynil which cause rapid gfp-nit <dig> aggregation, loss of nuclear contents and cellular collapse, but not nuclear contraction, separating this response from others during plant cell death.


CONCLUSIONS
our observations place aggregation of nitrilase  <dig> as one of the earliest events associated with wound and herbicide-induced cell death and highlight several novel cellular events that occur as plant cells die. our data create a detailed descriptive framework for future investigations of plant cell death and provide new tools for both its cellular and biochemical analysis.
