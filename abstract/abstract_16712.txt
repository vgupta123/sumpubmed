BACKGROUND
next-generation dna sequencing technologies such as illumina's solexa platform and roche's  <dig> approach provide new avenues for investigating genome-scale questions. however, they also present novel analytical challenges that must be met for their effective application to biological questions.


RESULTS
here we report the availability of tileqc, a tile-based quality control system for solexa data written in the r language. tileqc provides a means of recognizing bias and error in solexa output by graphically representing data generated by flow cell tiles. the data represented in the images is then made available in the r environment for further analysis and automation of error detection.


CONCLUSIONS
tileqc offers a highly adaptable and powerful tool for the quality control of solexa-based dna sequence data.
