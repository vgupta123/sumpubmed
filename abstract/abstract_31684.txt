BACKGROUND
grain length, as a critical trait for rice grain size and shape, has a great effect on grain yield and appearance quality. although several grain size/shape genes have been cloned, the genetic interaction among these genes and the molecular mechanisms of grain size/shape architecture have not yet to be explored.


RESULTS
to investigate the genetic interaction between two major grain length loci of rice, gs <dig> and qgl <dig>  we developed two near-isogenic lines , nil-gs <dig>  and nil-qgl <dig> , in the genetic background of 93– <dig>  by conventional backcrossing and marker-assisted selection . another nil-gs3/qgl <dig>  was developed by crossing nil-gs <dig> with nil-qgl <dig> and using mas. by comparing the grain lengths of 93– <dig>  nil-gs <dig>  nil-qgl <dig> and nil-gs3/qgl <dig>  we investigated the effects of gs <dig>  qgl <dig> and gs3 × qgl <dig> interaction on grain length based on two-way anova. we found that gs <dig> and qgl <dig> had additive effects on rice grain length regulation. comparative analysis of primary panicle transcriptomes in the four nils revealed that the genes affected by gs <dig> and qgl <dig> partially overlapped, and both loci might be involved in brassinosteroid signaling.


CONCLUSIONS
our data provide new information to better understand the rice grain length regulation mechanism and help rice breeders improve rice yield and appearance quality by molecular design breeding.
