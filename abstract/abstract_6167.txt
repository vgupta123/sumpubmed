BACKGROUND
interleukin  <dig>  is a pleiotropic cytokine with anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and hematopoietic potential. the il- <dig> activity is determined by the expression of the il-11r receptor alpha  and the signal transducing subunit β  on the cell membrane. a recombinant soluble form of the il-11rα  in combination with il- <dig> acts as an agonist on cells expressing the gp <dig> molecule. we constructed a designer cytokine hyper il- <dig> , which is exclusively composed of naturally existing components. it contains the full length sil-11rα connected with the mature il- <dig> protein using their natural sequences only. such a construct has two major advantages:  its components are as close as possible to the natural forms of both proteins and  it lacks an artificial linker what should avoid induction of antibody production.


RESULTS
the h <dig> construct was generated, the protein was produced in a baculovirus expression system and was then purified by using ion exchange chromatography. the h <dig> protein displayed activity in three independent bioassays,  it induced acute phase proteins production in hepg <dig> cells expressing il- <dig>  il-11rα and gp <dig>   it stimulated the proliferation of b <dig> cells  and  proliferation of baf/3-gp <dig> cells . moreover, the preliminary data indicated that h <dig> was functionally distinct from hyper-il- <dig>  a molecule which utilizes the same homodimer of signal transducing receptor .


CONCLUSIONS
the biologically active h <dig> may be potentially useful for treatment of thrombocytopenia, infertility, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular diseases or inflammatory disorders.
