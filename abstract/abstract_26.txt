BACKGROUND
haptic sensing with the fingers represents a unique class of manipulative actions, engaging motor, somatosensory and associative areas of the cortex while requiring only minimal forces and relatively simple movement patterns. using transcranial magnetic stimulation , we investigated task-related changes in motor evoked potential  amplitude associated with unimanual haptic sensing in two related experiments. in experiment i, we contrasted changes in the excitability of the hemisphere controlling the task hand in young and old adults under two trial conditions, i.e. when participants either touched a fine grating  or touched a coarse grating to detect its groove orientation . in experiment ii, the same contrast between tasks was performed but with tms applied over the hemisphere controlling the resting hand, while also addressing hemispheric  and age differences.


RESULTS
in experiment i, a main effect of trial type on mep amplitude was detected , meps in the task hand being ~50% larger during grating than smooth trials. no interaction with age was detected. similar results were found for experiment ii, trial type having a large effect on mep amplitude in the resting hand  owing to selective increase in mep size  for grating trials. no interactions with age or side  were detected.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, these results indicate that adding a haptic component to a simple unilateral finger action can elicit robust corticomotor facilitation not only in the working hemisphere but also in the opposite hemisphere. the fact that this facilitation seems well preserved with age, when task difficulty is adjusted, has some potential clinical implications.
