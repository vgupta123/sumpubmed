BACKGROUND
estimates of demographic parameters, such as age-specific survival and fecundity, age at first pregnancy and litter size, are required for roaming dogs  to assess the likely effect of proposed methods of population control. data resulting from individual identification of dogs spayed as part of an animal birth control  programme in jaipur, india, are used to derive such parameters for the roaming dog population of that city.


RESULTS
the percentage of females becoming pregnant in any given year was estimated by inspection of over  <dig>  females caught for spaying from  <dig> to  <dig>  the point estimate is  <dig> % with a 95% confidence interval from 44% to 51%. adult annual survival of spayed females was estimated by recapture of  <dig> spayed females from  <dig> to  <dig>  the point estimate is  <dig>  , corresponding to an expected total lifespan of  <dig>  years for a spayed female at one year old.


CONCLUSIONS
recording the pregnancy status of dogs collected for spaying and individual marking of dogs released following spaying can provide estimates of some of the demographic parameters essential for predicting the future effectiveness of an abc programme. further, we suggest that recording the number and location of spayed and unspayed dogs encountered by the catching teams could be the most effective way to monitor the size and composition of the roaming dog population.
