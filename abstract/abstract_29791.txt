BACKGROUND
to assess the impact of disease activity on health-related quality of life  in systemic lupus erythematosus .

methods
cross-sectional study of patients included in the swiss sle cohort study between april  <dig> and june  <dig>  hrqol outcomes were based on the medical outcome study short form  <dig> . disease activity was assessed by the sle disease activity index score with the safety of estrogens in sle national assessment modification  and by the physican’s global assessment .


RESULTS
of the  <dig> patients included,  <dig>  were women. median  age was  <dig>  years. sle was active in  <dig> patients . median  mental component summary  in active vs inactive sle was  <dig>   compared to  <dig>    and median  physical component summary   <dig>   compared to  <dig>  , respectively . increase in selena-sledai or increase in pga were negatively correlated with pcs and/or mcs. after adjusting for gender, age and disease duration, disease activity impacted on both pcs and mcs and all subscales except general health. active lupus nephritis and musculoskeletal involvement were associated with physical limitations and emotional problems, increased bodily pain and poor social functioning. low complement and/or presence of anti-dsdna antibodies were associated with increased fatigue and reduced mental health.


CONCLUSIONS
in patients with sle, hrqol is reduced in those with active disease. impact of disease activity on hrqol dimensions depends on selena-sledai system components.
