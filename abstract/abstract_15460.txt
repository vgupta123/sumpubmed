BACKGROUND
diagnostics and disease-management strategies require technologies to enable the simultaneous detection and quantification of a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms. most multiplex, quantitative detection methods available suffer from compromises between the level of multiplexing, throughput and accuracy of quantification. here, we demonstrate the efficacy of a novel, high-throughput, ligation-based assay for simultaneous quantitative detection of multiple plant pathogens. the ligation probes, designated plant research international-lock probes , are long oligonucleotides with target complementary regions at their 5' and 3' ends. upon perfect target hybridization, the pri-lock probes are circularized via enzymatic ligation, subsequently serving as template for individual, standardized amplification via unique probe-specific primers. adaptation to openarrays™, which can accommodate up to  <dig>  <dig> nl pcr amplifications, allowed high-throughput real-time quantification. the assay combines the multiplex capabilities and specificity of ligation reactions with high-throughput real-time pcr in the openarray™, resulting in a flexible, quantitative multiplex diagnostic system.


RESULTS
the performance of the pri-lock detection system was demonstrated using  <dig> probes targeting several significant plant pathogens at different taxonomic levels. all probes specifically detected their corresponding targets and provided perfect discrimination against non-target organisms with very similar ligation target sites. the nucleic acid targets could be reliably quantified over  <dig> orders of magnitude with a dynamic detection range of more than  <dig>  pathogen quantification was equally robust in single target versus mixed target assays.


CONCLUSIONS
this novel assay enables very specific, high-throughput, quantitative detection of multiple pathogens over a wide range of target concentrations and should be easily adaptable for versatile diagnostic purposes.
