BACKGROUND
s <dig> proteins are a family of small, ef-hand containing calcium-binding signaling proteins that are implicated in many cancers. while the majority of human s <dig> proteins share 25-65% sequence similarity, s100a <dig> and its recently identified paralog, s100a <dig>  display 93% sequence identity. intriguingly, however, s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> serve distinct roles in inflammatory skin disease; s100a <dig> signals through the receptor for advanced glycation products  in a zinc-dependent manner, while s100a <dig> signals through a yet unidentified g-protein coupled receptor in a zinc-independent manner. of the seven divergent residues that differentiate s100a <dig> and s100a <dig>  four cluster in a zinc-binding region and the remaining three localize to a predicted receptor-binding surface.


RESULTS
to investigate the structural and functional consequences of these divergent clusters, we report the x-ray crystal structures of s100a <dig> and s100a7d24g, a hybrid variant where the zinc ligand asp <dig> of s100a <dig> has been substituted with the glycine of s100a <dig>  to  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å resolution, respectively. remarkably, despite replacement of the asp ligand, zinc binding is retained at the s100a <dig> dimer interface with distorted tetrahedral geometry and a chloride ion serving as an exogenous fourth ligand. zinc binding was confirmed using anomalous difference maps and solution binding studies that revealed similar affinities of zinc for s100a <dig> and s100a <dig>  additionally, the predicted receptor-binding surface on s100a <dig> is substantially more basic in s100a <dig> without incurring structural rearrangement.


CONCLUSIONS
here we demonstrate that s100a <dig> retains the ability to coordinate zinc through incorporation of an exogenous ligand resulting in a unique zinc-binding site among s <dig> proteins. the altered surface chemistry between s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> that localizes to the predicted receptor binding site is likely responsible for the differential recognition of distinct protein targets. collectively, these data provide novel insight into the structural and functional consequences of the divergent surfaces between s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> that may be exploited for targeted therapies.
