BACKGROUND
the challenge of gene expression studies is to reliably quantify levels of transcripts, but this is hindered by a number of factors including sample availability, handling and storage. the paxgene™ blood rna system includes a stabilizing additive in a plastic evacuated tube, but requires  <dig>  ml blood, which makes routine implementation impractical for paediatric use.

the aim of this study was to modify the paxgene™ blood rna system kit protocol for application to small, sick chidren, without compromising rna integrity, and subsequently to perform quantitative analysis of icam and interleukin- <dig> gene expression.

aliquots of  <dig>  ml paxgene™ reagent were put into microtubes and  <dig>  ml whole blood added to maintain the same recommended proportions as in the paxgene™ evacuated tube system. rna quality was assessed using the agilent bioanalyser  <dig> and an in-house taqman™ assay which measures gapdh transcript integrity by determining 3' to 5' ratios. qpcr analysis was performed on an additional panel of  <dig> housekeeping genes. three reference genes  were identified using the genorm algorithm, which were subsequently used to normalising target gene expression levels. icam- <dig> and il- <dig> gene expression were measured in  <dig> malawian children with invasive pneumococcal disease.


RESULTS
total rna yield was between  <dig>  and  <dig>  ng and the bioanalyser  <dig> demonstrated discernible 18s and 28s bands. the cycle threshold values obtained for the seven housekeeping genes were between  <dig> and  <dig> and showed good consistency. median relative icam and il- <dig> gene expression were significantly reduced in non-survivors compared to survivors .


CONCLUSIONS
we have successfully modified the paxgene™ blood collection system for use in small children and demonstrated preservation of rna integrity and successful quantitative real-time pcr analysis.
