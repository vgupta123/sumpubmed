BACKGROUND
h. pylori infection may trigger smad <dig> and nfκb expression in the stomach, whereas probiotics promote gastrointestinal health and improve intestinal inflammation caused by pathogens. this study examines if probiotics can improve h. pylori-induced gastric inflammation by inactivating the smad <dig> and nfκb pathways.


RESULTS
challenge with h. pylori increased il- <dig> and tnf-α expressions but not tgf-β <dig> in mkn <dig> cells. the rna levels of smad <dig> in ags cells increased after h. pylori infection in a dose-dependent manner. a higher dose  of l. acidophilus pre-treatment attenuated the h. pylori-induced il- <dig> expressions, but not tgf-β <dig>  such anti-inflammatory effect was mediated via increased cytoplasmic iκbα and depletion of nuclear nfκb. l. acidophilus also inhibited h. pylori-induced smad <dig> transcription by inactivating the jak <dig> and stat <dig> pathways, which might activate the tgf-β1/smad pathway. l. acidophilus pre-treatment ameliorated ifn-γ-induced smad <dig> translation level and subsequently reduced nuclear nf-κb production, as detected by western blotting.


CONCLUSIONS
h. pylori infection induces smad <dig>  nfκb, il- <dig>  and tnf-α production in vitro. higher doses of l. acidophilus pre-treatment reduce h. pylori-induced inflammation through the inactivation of the smad <dig> and nfκb pathways.
