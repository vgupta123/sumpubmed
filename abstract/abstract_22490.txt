BACKGROUND
under drought, plants accumulate the signaling hormone abscisic acid , which induces the rapid closure of stomatal pores to prevent water loss. this event is trigged by a series of signals produced inside guard cells which finally reduce their turgor. many of these events are tightly regulated at the transcriptional level, including the control exerted by myb proteins. in a previous study, while identifying the grapevine r2r <dig> myb family, two closely related genes, vvmyb <dig> and vvmyb <dig> were found with high similarity to atmyb <dig>  an arabidopsis guard cell-related drought responsive gene.


RESULTS
promoter-gus transcriptional fusion assays showed that expression of vvmyb <dig> was restricted to stomatal guard cells and was attenuated in response to aba. unlike vvmyb <dig>  vvmyb <dig> was able to complement the loss-of-function atmyb60- <dig> mutant, indicating that vvmyb <dig> is the only true ortholog of atmyb <dig> in the grape genome. in addition, vvmyb <dig> was differentially regulated during development of grape organs and in response to aba and drought-related stress conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
these results show that vvmyb <dig> modulates physiological responses in guard cells, leading to the possibility of engineering stomatal conductance in grapevine, reducing water loss and helping this species to tolerate drought under extreme climatic conditions.
