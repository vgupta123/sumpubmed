BACKGROUND
tandem repeat  variants in the human genome play key roles in a number of diseases. however, current models predicting variability are based on limited training sets. we conducted a systematic analysis of trs of unit lengths 2– <dig> nucleotides in whole genome shotgun  sequences to define the extent of variation of  <dig>  unique repeat loci throughout the genome.


RESULTS
we applied a multivariate statistical model to predict tr variability. predicted heterozygosity correlated with heterozygosity in the ceph polymorphism database  better than the correlation between the ceph and wgs data , presumably because the model smoothes noise from small sample sizes. a multivariate logistic model of  <dig> parameters accounted for 36% of the variation in the wgs data. validation studies of  <dig> experimentally investigated trs revealed high concordance with the model's predictions .


CONCLUSIONS
variability among 2–12-mer trs in the genome can be modeled by a few parameters, which do not markedly differ according to unit length, consistent with a common mechanism for the generation of variability among such trs. analysis of the distributions of observed and predicted variants across the genome showed a general concordance, indicating that the repeat variation dataset does not exhibit strong regional ascertainment biases. this revealed a deficit of variant repeats in chromosomes  <dig> and y – likely to reflect a reduction in 2-mer repeats in the former and a reduced level of recombination in the latter – and excesses in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>
