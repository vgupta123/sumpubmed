BACKGROUND
the chickrh <dig> whole chicken genome radiation hybrid  panel recently produced has already been used to build radiation hybrid maps for several chromosomes, generating comparative maps with the human and mouse genomes and suggesting improvements to the chicken draft sequence assembly. here we present the construction of a rh map of chicken chromosome  <dig>  markers from the genetic map were used for alignment to the existing gga <dig>  linkage group and est were used to provide valuable comparative mapping information. finally, all markers from the rh map were localised on the chicken draft sequence assembly to check for eventual discordances.


RESULTS
eighty eight microsatellite markers,  <dig> genes and  <dig> est were selected from the genetic map or on the basis of available comparative mapping information. out of these  <dig> markers,  <dig> gave reliable amplifications on the radiation hybrid panel and  <dig> were effectively assigned to gga <dig>  the final rh map is  <dig> cr <dig> long and is composed of  <dig> framework markers distributed in  <dig> groups. conservation of synteny was found between gga <dig> and eight human chromosomes, with segments of conserved gene order of varying lengths.


CONCLUSIONS
we obtained a radiation hybrid map of chicken chromosome  <dig>  comparison to the human genome indicated that most of the  <dig> groups of conserved synteny studied underwent internal rearrangements. the alignment of our rh map to the first draft of the chicken genome sequence assembly revealed a good agreement between both sets of data, indicative of a low error rate.
