BACKGROUND
a modification of a standard method of fluorescence in situ hybridisation  is described, by which a combination of several substrates and probes on single microscope slides enables more accurate comparisons of the distribution and abundance of chromosomal sequences and improves the relatively low throughput of standard fish methods.


RESULTS
the utility and application of multi-colour, multi-substrate fish is illustrated by the simultaneous physical mapping of retrotransposon sequences to three species of avena, and single locus bac  clones and rdna probes to three species of brachypodium, demonstrating how this would enable better understanding of complex phylogenetic relationships among some of the species belonging to these two genera.


CONCLUSIONS
the results show that use of multi-substrate chromosome preparations significantly increases the utility of fish in comparative analyses of the distribution and abundance of chromosomal sequences in closely related plant species.
