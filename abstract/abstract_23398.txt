BACKGROUND
the increasing popularity gained by pet birds over recent decades has highlighted the role of avian medicine and surgery in the global veterinary scenario; such a need for speciality avian medical practice reflects the rising expectation for high-standard diagnostic imaging procedures. the aim of this study is to provide an atlas of matched anatomical cross-sections and contrast-enhanced ct images of the coelomic cavity in three highly diffused psittacine species.


RESULTS
contrast-enhanced computed tomographic studies of the coelomic cavity were performed in  <dig> blue-and-gold macaws,  <dig> african grey parrots and  <dig> monk parakeets by means of a 4-multidetector-row ct scanner. both pre- and post-contrast scans were acquired. anatomical reference cross-sections were obtained from  <dig> blue-and-gold macaw,  <dig> african grey parrot, and  <dig> monk parakeet cadavers. the specimens were stored in a −20 °c freezer until completely frozen and then sliced at 5-mm intervals by means of a band saw. all the slices were photographed on both sides. individual anatomical structures were identified by means of the available literature. pre- and post-contrast attenuation reference values for the main coelomic organs are reported in hounsfield units .


CONCLUSIONS
the results provide an atlas of matched anatomical cross-sections and contrast-enhanced ct images of the coelomic cavity in three highly diffused psittacine species.
