BACKGROUND
actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> is known as the wild type producer of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose, a potent drug used worldwide in the treatment of type- <dig> diabetes mellitus. as the incidence of diabetes is rapidly rising worldwide, an ever increasing demand for diabetes drugs, such as acarbose, needs to be anticipated. consequently, derived actinoplanes strains with increased acarbose yields are being used in large scale industrial batch fermentation since  <dig> and were continuously optimized by conventional mutagenesis and screening experiments. this strategy reached its limits and is generally superseded by modern genetic engineering approaches. as a prerequisite for targeted genetic modifications, the complete genome sequence of the organism has to be known.


RESULTS
here, we present the complete genome sequence of actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> , the first publicly available genome of the genus actinoplanes, comprising various producers of pharmaceutically and economically important secondary metabolites. the genome features a high mean g + c content of  <dig> % and consists of one circular chromosome with a size of  <dig> , <dig> bp hosting  <dig>  predicted protein coding sequences. phylogenetic analysis of the core genome revealed a rather distant relation to other sequenced species of the family micromonosporaceae whereas actinoplanes utahensis was found to be the closest species based on 16s rrna gene sequence comparison. besides the already published acarbose biosynthetic gene cluster sequence, several new non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-, polyketide synthase- and hybrid-clusters were identified on the actinoplanes genome. another key feature of the genome represents the discovery of a functional actinomycete integrative and conjugative element.


CONCLUSIONS
the complete genome sequence of actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> marks an important step towards the rational genetic optimization of the acarbose production. in this regard, the identified actinomycete integrative and conjugative element could play a central role by providing the basis for the development of a genetic transformation system for actinoplanes sp. se50/ <dig> and other actinoplanes spp. furthermore, the identified non-ribosomal peptide synthetase- and polyketide synthase-clusters potentially encode new antibiotics and/or other bioactive compounds, which might be of pharmacologic interest.
