BACKGROUND
macrosatellites are some of the largest variable number tandem repeats in the human genome, but what role these unusual sequences perform is unknown. their importance to human health is clearly demonstrated by the 4q <dig> macrosatellite d4z <dig> that is associated with the onset of the muscle degenerative disease facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. nevertheless, many other macrosatellite arrays in the human genome remain poorly characterized.


RESULTS
here we describe the organization, tandem repeat copy number variation, transmission stability and expression of four macrosatellite arrays in the human genome: the taf11-like array located on chromosomes 5p <dig> , the sst <dig> arrays on 4q <dig>  and 19q <dig> , the prr <dig> array located on chromosome 13q <dig> , and the zav array at 9q <dig>  all are polymorphic macrosatellite arrays that at least for taf11-like and sst <dig> show evidence of meiotic instability. with the exception of the sst <dig> array that is ubiquitously expressed, all are expressed at high levels in the testis and to a lesser extent in the brain.


CONCLUSIONS
our results extend the number of characterized macrosatellite arrays in the human genome and provide the foundation for formulation of hypotheses to begin assessing their functional role in the human genome.
