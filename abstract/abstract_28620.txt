BACKGROUND
using gene co-expression analysis, researchers were able to predict clusters of genes with consistent functions that are relevant to cancer development and prognosis. we applied a weighted gene co-expression network  analysis algorithm on glioblastoma multiforme  data obtained from the tcga project and predicted a set of gene co-expression networks which are related to gbm prognosis.

methods
we modified the quasi-clique merger algorithm  into edge-covering quasi-clique merger algorithm  for mining weighted sub-network in wgcn. each sub-network is considered a set of features to separate patients into two groups using k-means algorithm. survival times of the two groups are compared using log-rank test and kaplan-meier curves. simulations using random sets of genes are carried out to determine the thresholds for log-rank test p-values for network selection. sub-networks with p-values less than their corresponding thresholds were further merged into clusters based on overlap ratios . the functions for each cluster are analyzed using gene ontology enrichment analysis.


RESULTS
using the eqcm algorithm, we identified  <dig>  sub-networks in the wgcn, out of which  <dig> sub-networks show p-values less than their corresponding thresholds. they were then merged into  <dig> clusters.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> gene clusters associated with gbm prognosis using the eqcm algorithm. our results not only confirmed previous findings including the importance of cell cycle and immune response in gbm, but also suggested important epigenetic events in gbm development and prognosis.
