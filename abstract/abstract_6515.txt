BACKGROUND
since prion gene-knockout mice do not contract prion diseases and animals in which production of prion protein  is reduced by half are resistant to the disease, we hypothesized that bovine animals with reduced prp would be tolerant to bse. hence, attempts were made to produce bovine prnp  that could be knocked down by rna interference  technology. before an in vivo study, optimal conditions for knocking down bprnp were determined in cultured mammalian cell systems. factors examined included sirna  expression plasmid vectors, target sites of prnp, and lengths of sirnas.


RESULTS
four sirna expression plasmid vectors were used: three harboring different cloning sites were driven by the human u <dig> promoter , and one by the human trnaval promoter. six target sites of bovine prnp were designed using an algorithm. from  <dig>  to  <dig>  sirna expression vectors were constructed for each target site. as targets of sirna, the entire bprnp coding sequence was connected to the reporter gene of the fluorescent egfp, or of firefly luciferase or renilla luciferase. target plasmid dna was co-transfected with sirna expression vector dna into helas <dig> cells, and fluorescence or luminescence was measured. the activities of sirnas varied widely depending on the target sites, length of the sirnas, and vectors used. longer sirnas were less effective, and  <dig> mer or  <dig> mer was generally optimal. although  <dig> mer ggggagaacttcaccgaaact expressed by a hu6-driven plasmid with a bsp mi cloning site was best under the present experimental conditions, the corresponding trna promoter-driven plasmid was almost equally useful. the effectiveness of this sirna was confirmed by immunostaining and western blotting.


CONCLUSIONS
four sirna expression plasmid vectors, six target sites of bprnp, and various lengths of sirnas from  <dig> mer to  <dig> mer were examined to establish optimal conditions for knocking down of bprnp in vitro. the most effective sirna so far tested was  <dig> mer ggggagaacttcaccgaaact driven either by a hu <dig> or trna promoter, a finding that provides a basis for further studies in vivo.
