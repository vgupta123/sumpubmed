BACKGROUND
recently, we introduced the complete genome sequence of mycobacterium massiliense clinical isolates, asan  <dig> belonging to type ii genotype with rough colony morphology. here, to address the issue of whether the rough colony morphotype of m. massiliense type ii genotype is genetically determined or not, we compared polymorphisms of the glycopeptidolipid  gene locus between m. massiliense type ii asan  <dig> and other rapidly growing mycobacteria  strains via analysis of genome databases.


RESULTS
we found deletions of  <dig> genes , in the gpl biosynthesis related gene cluster of asan  <dig> genome, but no deletions in those of other smooth rgms. to check the presence of deletions of gpl biosynthesis related genes in mycobacterium abscessus − complex strains, pcrs targeting  <dig> different gpl genes  were applied into  <dig> clinical strains of the m. abscessus complex strains . no strains of the type ii genotype produced pcr amplicons in a total of  <dig> deleted gpl genes, suggesting loss of gpl biosynthesis genes in the genome of m. massiliense type ii genotype strains.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggested that the rough colony morphotype of the m. massiliense type ii genotype may be acquired via deletion events at the gpl gene locus for evolutionary adaptation between the host and pathogen.
