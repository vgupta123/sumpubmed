BACKGROUND
on porcine chromosome  <dig>  the region surrounding the major histocompatibility complex  contains several quantitative trait loci  influencing many traits including growth, back fat thickness and carcass composition. previous studies highlighted that a fragment of ~ <dig>  mb is located within the swine leucocyte antigen  complex. internal rearrangements of this fragment were suggested, and partial contigs had been built, but further characterization of this region and identification of all human chromosomal fragments orthologous to this porcine fragment had to be carried out.


RESULTS
a whole physical map of the region was constructed by integrating radiation hybrid  mapping, bac fingerprinting data of the inra bac library and anchoring bac end sequences on the human genome.  <dig> genes and  <dig> reference microsatellites were ordered on the high resolution imnprh212000rad radiation hybrid panel. a 1000: <dig> framework map covering  <dig> cr <dig> was established and a complete contig of the region was developed. new micro rearrangements were highlighted between the porcine and human genomes. a bovine rh map was also developed in this region by mapping  <dig> genes. comparison of the organization of this region in pig, cattle, human, mouse, dog and chicken genomes revealed that 1) the translocation of the fragment described previously is observed only on the bovine and porcine genomes and 2) the new internal micro rearrangements are specific of the porcine genome.


CONCLUSIONS
we estimate that the region contains several rearrangements and covers  <dig>  mb of the porcine genome. the study of this complete bac contig showed that human chromosomal fragments homologs of this heavily rearranged qtl region are all located in the region of hsa <dig> that surrounds the centromere. this work allows us to define a list of all candidate genes that could explain these qtl effects.
