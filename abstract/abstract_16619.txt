BACKGROUND
protein tertiary structure comparisons are employed in various fields of contemporary structural biology. most structure comparison methods involve generation of an initial seed alignment, which is extended and/or refined to provide the best structural superposition between a pair of protein structures as assessed by a structure comparison metric. one such metric, the tm-score, was recently introduced to provide a combined structure quality measure of the coordinate root mean square deviation between a pair of structures and coverage. using the tm-score, the tm-align structure alignment algorithm was developed that was often found to have better accuracy and coverage than the most commonly used structural alignment programs; however, there were a number of situations when this was not true.


RESULTS
to further improve structure alignment quality, the fr-tm-align algorithm has been developed where aligned fragment pairs are used to generate the initial seed alignments that are then refined using dynamic programming to maximize the tm-score. for the assessment of the structural alignment quality from fr-tm-align in comparison to other programs such as ce and tm-align, we examined various alignment quality assessment scores such as psi and tm-score. the assessment showed that the structural alignment quality from fr-tm-align is better in comparison to both ce and tm-align. on average, the structural alignments generated using fr-tm-align have a higher tm-score  and coverage  in comparison to those generated by tm-align. fr-tm-align uses an exhaustive procedure to generate initial seed alignments. hence, the algorithm is computationally more expensive than tm-align.


CONCLUSIONS
fr-tm-align, a new algorithm that employs fragment alignment and assembly provides better structural alignments in comparison to tm-align. the source code and executables of fr-tm-align are freely downloadable at: .
