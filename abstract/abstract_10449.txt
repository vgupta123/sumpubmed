BACKGROUND
bovine tuberculosis  and bovine brucellosis are two important milk-borne zoonoses that have been shown to be prevalent to various degrees in ethiopian cattle.

the study was carried out in four woredas  around asella town, arsi zone between october  <dig> and march  <dig> and included  <dig> small-holders in  <dig> dairy cooperatives that marketed the delivered milk. the aims of the study were i) to assess the prevalence of the two diseases in cattle in a cross-sectional study, ii) to assess potential risk factors of btb and brucellosis to humans as well as the knowledge-attitude-practice  among these farmers towards these diseases.


RESULTS
btb testing using the comparative intradermal skin test  was done on  <dig> milking cows, out of which  <dig> were serologically tested for brucellosis using the rose bengal plate test and reactors confirmed with an indirect elisa test . the individual animal prevalence was  <dig> %  for btb,  <dig> %  for brucellosis and  <dig> %  for mac . of the  <dig> milk cooperatives, two had at least one positive btb reactor and five had animals positive for brucellosis.

cross-breeds accounted for 100% and  <dig> % of the btb and brucellosis reactors respectively. for both diseases, there were prevalence variations depending on woreda. no animal was concomitant reactor for btb and brucellosis.

raw milk was consumed by  <dig> % of the respondents.  <dig> % of the respondents reported touching the afterbirth with bare hands. the latter was fed to dogs in 83% of the households. one cow among the herds of the  <dig> interviewees had aborted in the last  <dig> months. among the interviewees, 77% stated knowing tuberculosis in general but  <dig> out of the  <dig> respondents  did not know that btb was transmitted by livestock. less than half  of the respondents knew about brucellosis.


CONCLUSIONS
low prevalence of both diseases reflected the potential for the area to compete with the growing milk demand. the authors discussed the possible control strategies for the area.
