BACKGROUND
autophagy-related atg <dig> proteins are pleiotropic proteins functioning in autophagy and the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-signaling pathways. arabidopsis atg <dig> regulates normal plant growth, pollen development and germination, and plant responses to biotic/abiotic stresses. however, the atg <dig> functions in wheat , an important food crop, are lacking.


RESULTS
we identified three members, taatg6a-6c, of the atg <dig> family from common wheat. taatg6a, 6b and 6c were localized on homeologous chromosomes 3dl, 3bl and 3al, respectively, of the allo-hexaploid wheat genome, and evidence was provided for their essential role in autophagy. the taatg6a-gfp fusion protein was found in punctate pre-autophagosomal structures. the expression of each taatg <dig> gene restored the accumulation of autophagic bodies in atg6-mutant yeast. additionally, taatg <dig> knockdown plants showed impaired constitutive and pathogen-induced autophagy and growth abnormalities under normal conditions. we also examined the expression patterns of wheat atg6s for clues to their physiological roles, and found that their expression was induced by the fungus blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici , the causal agent of powdery mildew, and by abiotic stress factors. a role for taatg6s in wheat immunity to powdery mildew was further implied when knockdowns of taatg6s weakly compromised the broad-spectrum powdery mildew resistance gene pm21-triggered resistance response and, conversely and significantly, enhanced the basal resistance of susceptible plants. in addition, leaf cell death was sometimes induced by growth-retarded small bgt mycelia on susceptible taatg <dig> knockdown plants after a long period of interaction. thus, we provide an important extension of the previous characterization of plant atg <dig> genes in wheat, and observed a role for autophagy genes in wheat immune responses to fungal pathogens.


CONCLUSIONS
three wheat atg6s were identified and shown to be essential for autophagy biogenesis. wheat atg6s are implicated in immunity to powdery mildew, playing a weak, positive role in the pm21-triggered resistance response and a negative role in the basal resistance of susceptible plants.
