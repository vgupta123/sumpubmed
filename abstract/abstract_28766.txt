BACKGROUND
lim domain binding protein  <dig>  is a transcriptional co-factor, which interacts with multiple transcription factors and other proteins containing lim domains. complete inactivation of ldb <dig> in mice resulted in early embryonic lethality with severe patterning defects during gastrulation. tissue-specific deletions using a conditional knockout allele revealed additional roles of ldb <dig> in the development of the central nervous system, hematopoietic system, and limbs. the goal of the current study was to determine the importance of ldb <dig> function during craniofacial development in mouse embryos.


RESULTS
we generated tissue-specific ldb <dig> mutants using wnt1-cre, which causes deletion of a floxed allele in the neural crest; neural crest-derived cells contribute to most of the mesenchyme of the developing face. all examined wnt1-cre;ldb1

 mutants suffered from cleft secondary palate. therefore, we performed a series of experiments to investigate how ldb <dig> regulated palate development. first, we examined the expression of ldb <dig> during normal development, and found that ldb <dig> was expressed broadly in the palatal mesenchyme during early stages of palate development. second, we compared the morphology of the developing palate in control and ldb <dig> mutant embryos using sections. we found that the mutant palatal shelves had abnormally blunt appearance, and failed to elevate above the tongue at the posterior domain. an in vitro head culture experiment indicated that the elevation defect was not due to interference by the tongue. finally, in the ldb <dig> mutant palatal shelves, cell proliferation was abnormal in the anterior, and the expression of wnt5a, pax <dig> and osr <dig>  which regulate palatal shelf elevation, was also altered.


CONCLUSIONS
the function of ldb <dig> in the neural crest-derived palatal mesenchyme is essential for normal morphogenesis of the secondary palate.
