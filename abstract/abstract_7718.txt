BACKGROUND
two previously uncharacterized arabidopsis genes that encode proteins with acyltransferase plsc regions were selected for study based on their sequence similarity to a recently identified lung lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase . to identify their substrate specificity and biochemical properties, the two arabidopsis acyltransferases, designated atlpeat <dig>  , and atlpeat <dig>  were expressed in yeast knockout lines ale <dig> and slc <dig> that are deficient in microsomal lysophosphatidyl acyltransferase activities.


RESULTS
expression of atlpeat <dig> in the yeast knockout ale <dig> background exhibited strong acylation activity of lysophosphatidylethanolamine  and lysophosphatidate  with lower activity on lysophosphatidylcholine  and lysophosphatidylserine . atlpeat <dig> had specificities in the order of lpe > lpc > lps and had no or very low activity with lpa. both acyltransferases preferred 18:1-lpe over 16:0-lpe as acceptor and preferred palmitoyl-coa as acyl donor in combination with 18:1-lpe. both acyltransferases showed no or minor responses to ca2+, despite the presence of a calcium binding ef-hand region in atlpeat <dig>  atlpeat <dig> was more active at basic ph while atlpeat <dig> was equally active between ph  <dig>  â€“  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the first description of plant acyltransferases with a preference for lpe. in conclusion it is suggested that the two atlpeats, with their different biochemical and expression properties, have different roles in membrane metabolism/homoeostasis.
