BACKGROUND
invariant natural killer t  cells have been implicated in lung inflammation in humans and also shown to be a key cell type in inducing allergic lung inflammation in mouse models. inkt cells differentiate and acquire functional characteristics during development in the thymus. however, the correlation between development of inkt cells in the thymus and role in lung inflammation remains unknown. in addition, transcriptional control of differentiation of inkt cells into inkt cell effector subsets in the thymus during development is also unclear. in this report we show that β-catenin dependent mechanisms direct differentiation of inkt <dig> and inkt <dig> subsets but not inkt <dig> cells.

methods
to study the role for β-catenin in lung inflammation we utilize mice with conditional deletion and enforced expression of β-catenin in a well-established mouse model for il-25-dependen lung inflammation.


RESULTS
specifically, we demonstrate that conditional deletion of β-catenin permitted development of mature inkt <dig> cells while impeding maturation of inkt <dig> and  <dig> cells. a role for β-catenin expression in promoting inkt <dig> and inkt <dig> subsets was confirmed when we noted that enforced transgenic expression of β-catenin in inkt cell precursors enhanced the frequency and number of inkt <dig> and inkt <dig> cells at the cost of inkt <dig> cells. this effect of expression of β-catenin in inkt cell precursors was cell autonomous. furthermore, inkt <dig> cells acquired greater capability to produce type- <dig> cytokines when β-catenin expression was enhanced.

discussion
this report shows that β-catenin deficiency resulted in a profound decrease in inkt <dig> and inkt <dig> subsets of inkt cells whereas inkt <dig> cells developed normally. by contrast, enforced expression of β-catenin promoted the development of inkt <dig> and inkt <dig> cells. it was important to note that the majority of inkt cells in the thymus of c57bl/ <dig> mice were inkt <dig> cells and enforced expression of β-catenin altered the pattern to inkt <dig> and inkt <dig> cells suggesting that β-catenin may be a major factor in the distinct pathways that critically direct differentiation of inkt effector subsets.


CONCLUSIONS
thus, we demonstrate that β-catenin expression in inkt cell precursors promotes differentiation toward inkt <dig> and inkt <dig> effector subsets and supports enhanced capacity to produce type  <dig> and  <dig> cytokines which in turn augment lung inflammation in mice.
