BACKGROUND
selecting stably expressed reference genes is essential for proper reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction gene expression analysis. however, this choice is not always straightforward. in the case of differentiating human embryonic stem  cells, differentiation itself introduces changes whereby reference gene stability may be influenced.


RESULTS
in this study, we evaluated the stability of various references during retinoic acid-induced  differentiation of hes cells. out of  <dig> candidate references, beta-2-microglobulin, ribosomal protein l13a and alu repeats are found to be the most stable for this experimental set-up.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that some of the commonly used reference genes are actually not amongst the most stable loci during hes cell differentiation promoted by retinoic acid. moreover, a novel normalization strategy based on expressed alu repeats is validated for use in hes cell experiments.
