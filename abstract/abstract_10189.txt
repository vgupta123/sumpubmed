BACKGROUND
gender differences in gene expression were estimated in liver samples from  <dig> males and  <dig> females. the study tested  <dig>  genes for a gender difference using a design that adjusted for sources of variation associated with cdna arrays, normalization, hybridizations and processing conditions.


RESULTS
the genes were split into  <dig>  that were clearly expressed  and  <dig>  that had expression levels in the background range . the distribution of p-values from the 'not expressed' group was consistent with no gender differences. the distribution of p-values from the 'expressed' group suggested that  <dig> % of these genes differed by gender, but the estimated fold-changes  were small. the largest observed fold-change was  <dig> . the  <dig> % confidence bounds on the estimated fold-changes were less than  <dig>  fold for  <dig>  %, and few  exceed 2-fold.


CONCLUSIONS
observed gender differences in gene expression were small. when selecting genes with gender differences based upon their p-values, false discovery rates exceed  <dig> % for any set of genes, essentially making it impossible to identify any specific genes with a gender difference.
