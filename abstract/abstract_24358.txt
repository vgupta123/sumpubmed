BACKGROUND
olfactory receptors are key components in signal transduction. mutations in olfactory receptors alter the odor response, which is a fundamental response of organisms to their immediate environment. understanding the relationship between odorant response and mutations in olfactory receptors is an important problem in bioinformatics and computational biology. in this work, we have systematically analyzed the relationship between various physical, chemical, energetic and conformational properties of amino acid residues, and the change of odor response/compound's potency/half maximal effective concentration  due to amino acid substitutions.


RESULTS
we observed that both the characteristics of odorant molecule  and amino acid properties are important for odor response and ec <dig>  additional information on neighboring and surrounding residues of the mutants enhanced the correlation between amino acid properties and ec <dig>  further, amino acid properties have been combined systematically using multiple regression techniques and we obtained a correlation of  <dig> - <dig>  with odor response/ec <dig> of goldfish, mouse and human olfactory receptors. in addition, we have utilized machine learning methods to discriminate the mutants, which enhance or reduce ec <dig> values upon mutation and we obtained an accuracy of 93% and 79% for self-consistency and jack-knife tests, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis provides deep insights for understanding the odor response of olfactory receptor mutants and the present method could be used for identifying the mutants with enhanced specificity.
