BACKGROUND
human blood coagulation factor viii  is a large plasma glycoprotein with sequential domain arrangement in the order a1-a1-a2-a2-b-a3-a3-c1-c <dig>  the a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> domains are interconnected by long linker peptides  that possess the activation sites. proteolysis of fviii zymogen by thrombin or factor xa results in the generation of the activated form  which serves as a critical co-factor for factor ixa  enzyme in the intrinsic coagulation pathway.


RESULTS
in our efforts to elucidate the structural differences between fviii and fviiia, we developed the solution structural models of both forms, starting from an incomplete  <dig>  Ã… x-ray crystal structure of fviii zymogen, using explicit solvent md simulations. the full assembly of b-domainless single-chain fviii was built between the a1-a <dig>  and a3-c1-c <dig>  domains. the structural dynamics of fviii and fviiia, simulated for over  <dig> ns of time scale, enabled us to evaluate the integral motions of the multi-domain assembly of the co-factor and the possible coordination pattern of the functionally important calcium and copper ion binding in the protein.


CONCLUSIONS
md simulations predicted that the acidic linker peptide  between the a <dig> and a <dig> domains is largely flexible and appears to mask the exposure of putative fixa enzyme binding loop  region in the a <dig> domain. the simulation of fviiia, generated from the zymogen structure, predicted that the linker peptide  undergoes significant conformational reorganization upon activation by relocating completely to the a1-domain. the conformational transition led to the exposure of the tyr555-asp <dig> loop and the surrounding region in the a <dig> domain. while the proposed linker peptide conformation is predictive in nature and warrants further experimental validation, the observed conformational differences between the zymogen and activated forms may explain and support the large body of experimental data that implicated the critical importance of the cleavage of the peptide bond between the arg <dig> and ser <dig> residues for the full co-factor activity of fviii.
