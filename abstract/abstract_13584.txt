BACKGROUND
many components of the rna polymerase ii transcription machinery have been identified in kinetoplastid protozoa, but they diverge substantially from other eukaryotes. furthermore, protein-coding genes in these organisms lack individual transcriptional regulation, since they are transcribed as long polycistronic units. the transcription initiation sites are assumed to lie within the 'divergent strand-switch' regions at the junction between opposing polycistronic gene clusters. however, the mechanism by which kinetoplastidae initiate transcription is unclear, and promoter sequences are undefined.


RESULTS
the chromosomal location of tata-binding protein , small nuclear activating protein complex , and h <dig> histones were assessed in leishmania major using microarrays hybridized with dna obtained through chromatin immunoprecipitation . the tbp and snap <dig> binding patterns were almost identical and high intensity peaks were associated with trnas and snrnas. only  <dig> peaks of acetylated h <dig> histone were found in the entire genome, with substantially higher intensity in rapidly-dividing cells than stationary-phase. the majority of the acetylated h <dig> peaks were found at divergent strand-switch regions, but some occurred at chromosome ends and within polycistronic gene clusters. almost all these peaks were associated with lower intensity peaks of tbp/snap <dig> binding a few kilobases upstream, evidence that they represent transcription initiation sites.


CONCLUSIONS
the first genome-wide maps of dna-binding protein occupancy in a kinetoplastid organism suggest that h <dig> histones at the origins of polycistronic transcription of protein-coding genes are acetylated. global regulation of transcription initiation may be achieved by modifying the acetylation state of these origins.
