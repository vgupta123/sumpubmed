BACKGROUND
despite decades of extensive studies, the morbidity and mortality for acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome  remained high. particularly, biomarkers essential for its early diagnosis and prognosis are lacking.

methods
recent studies suggest that alveolar macrophages  at the exudative phase of ali/ards initiate, amplify and perpetuate inflammatory responses, while they resolve inflammation in the recovery phase to prevent further tissue injury and perpetuated inflammation in the lung. therefore, proteins relevant to this functional switch could be valuable biomarkers for ali/ards diagnosis and prognosis. we thus conducted comparative analysis of the am proteome to assess its dynamic proteomic changes during ali/ards progression and recovery.


RESULTS
 <dig> proteins were characterized to be differentially expressed between ams at the exudative and recovery phase. maldi-tof-ms and peptide mass fingerprint  analysis characterized  <dig> informative proteins, in which  <dig> proteins were found with a marked increase at the recovery phase, while the rest of  <dig> proteins were manifested by the significantly higher levels of expression at the exudative phase.


CONCLUSIONS
given the role of above identified proteins played in the regulation of inflammatory responses, cell skeleton organization, oxidative stress, apoptosis and metabolism, they have the potential to serve as biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis in the setting of patients with ali/ards.
