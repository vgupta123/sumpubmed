BACKGROUND
inversions and other structural polymorphisms often reduce the rate of recombination between sex chromosomes, making it impossible to fine map sex-determination loci using traditional genetic mapping techniques. here we compare distantly related species of tilapia that each segregate an xy system of sex-determination on linkage group  <dig>  we use whole genome sequencing to identify shared sex-patterned polymorphisms, which are candidates for the ancestral sex-determination mutation.


RESULTS
we found that sarotherodon melanotheron segregates an xy system on lg <dig> in the same region identified in oreochromis niloticus. both species have higher densities of sex-patterned snps, as well as elevated number of ancestral copy number variants in this region when compared to the rest of the genome, but the pattern of differentiation along lg <dig> differs between species. the number of sex-patterned snps shared by the two species is small, but larger than expected by chance, suggesting that a novel y-chromosome arose just before the divergence of the two species. we identified a shared sex-patterned snp that alters a gata <dig> binding site near wilms tumor protein that might be responsible for sex-determination.


CONCLUSIONS
shared sex-patterned snps, insertions and deletions suggest an ancestral sex-determination system that is common to both s. melanotheron and o. niloticus. functional analyses are needed to evaluate shared snps near candidate genes that might play a role in sex-determination of these species. interspecific variation in the sex chromosomes of tilapia species provides an excellent model system for understanding the evolution of vertebrate sex chromosomes.
