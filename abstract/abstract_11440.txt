BACKGROUND
previous magnetoencephalography  studies have demonstrated speaking-induced suppression  in the auditory cortex during vocalization tasks wherein the m <dig> response to a subject's own speaking is reduced compared to the response when they hear playback of their speech.


RESULTS
the present meg study investigated the effects of utterance rapidity and complexity on sis: the greatest difference between speak and listen m <dig> amplitudes  was found in the simple speech task. as the utterances became more rapid and complex, sis was significantly reduced .


CONCLUSIONS
these findings are highly consistent with our model of how auditory feedback is processed during speaking, where incoming feedback is compared with an efference-copy derived prediction of expected feedback. thus, the results provide further insights about how speech motor output is controlled, as well as the computational role of auditory cortex in transforming auditory feedback.
