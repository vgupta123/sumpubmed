BACKGROUND
adult plant rust resistance genes lr <dig> and lr <dig> confer race non-specific resistance to multiple fungal pathogens of wheat. induced, susceptible mutants were characterised for both genes.


RESULTS
three categories of lr <dig> mutants were identified that were either partial susceptible, fully susceptible or hyper-susceptible to stripe rust and leaf rust. the likely impact of the mutational change on the predicted lr <dig> protein correlated with differences in response to rust infection. four independent lr <dig> mutants were recovered that were susceptible to stripe rust, leaf rust and stem rust pathogens, including one possible hyper-susceptible lr <dig> mutant.


CONCLUSIONS
detailed study of lr <dig> mutants revealed that subtle changes in resistance response to multiple pathogens were correlated with mutational changes in the predicted protein. recovery of independent lr <dig> mutants indicates that as for lr <dig>  a single gene at the lr <dig> locus is likely to confer resistance to multiple pathogens. the infection phenotypes of lr <dig> mutants closely resembled that of lr <dig> mutants.
