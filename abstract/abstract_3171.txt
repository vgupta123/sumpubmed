BACKGROUND
water-soluble quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase  from acinetobacter calcoaceticus has a great potential for application as a glucose sensor constituent. because this enzyme shows no activity in its monomeric form, correct quaternary structure is essential for the formation of active enzyme. we have previously reported on the increasing of the stability of pqqgdh-b by preventing the subunit dissociation. previous studies were based on decreasing the entropy of quaternary structure dissociation but not on increasing the interaction between the two subunits. we therefore attempted to introduce a hydrophobic interaction in the dimeric interface to increase the stability of pqqgdh-b.


RESULTS
amino acid residues asn <dig> and tyr <dig> face each other at the dimer interface of pqqgdh-b, however no interaction exists between their side chains. we simultaneously substituted asn <dig> to phe and tyr <dig> to phe or ile, to create the two mutants asn340phe/tyr418phe and asn340phe/tyr418ile. furthermore, residues leu <dig>  val <dig> and val <dig> form a hydrophobic region that faces, on the other subunit, residues thr <dig> and thr <dig>  again without any specific interaction. we simultaneously substituted thr <dig> and thr <dig> to val, to create the mutant thr416val/thr417val. the temperatures resulting in lose of half of the initial activity of the constructed mutants were increased by 3–4°c higher over wild type. all mutants showed 2-fold higher thermal stability at 55°c than the wild-type enzyme, without decreasing their catalytic activities. from the 3d models of all the mutant enzymes, the predicted binding energies were found to be significantly greater that in the wild-type enzyme, consistent with the increases in thermal stabilities.


CONCLUSIONS
we have achieved via site-directed mutagenesis the improvement of the thermal stability of pqqgdh-b by increasing the dimer interface interaction. through rational design based on the quaternary structure of the enzyme, we selected residues located at the dimer interface that do not contribute to the intersubunit interaction. by substituting these residues to hydrophobic ones, the thermal stability of pqqgdh-b was increased without decreasing its catalytic activity.
