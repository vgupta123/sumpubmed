BACKGROUND
paralog reduction, the loss of duplicate genes after whole genome duplication  is a pervasive process. whether this loss proceeds gene by gene or through deletion of multi-gene dna segments is controversial, as is the question of fractionation bias, namely whether one homeologous chromosome is more vulnerable to gene deletion than the other.


RESULTS
as a null hypothesis, we first assume deletion events, on one homeolog only, excise a geometrically distributed number of genes with unknown mean µ, and these events combine to produce deleted runs of length l, distributed approximately as a negative binomial with unknown parameter r, itself a random variable with distribution π. a more realistic model requires deletion events on both homeologs distributed as a truncated geometric. we simulate the distribution of run lengths l in both models, as well as the underlying π, as a function of µ, and show how sampling l allows us to estimate µ. we apply this to data on a total of  <dig> genomes descended from  <dig> distinct wgd events and show how to correct the bias towards shorter runs caused by genome rearrangements. because of the difficulty in deriving π analytically, we develop a deterministic recurrence to calculate each π as a function of µ and the proportion of unreduced paralog pairs.


CONCLUSIONS
the parameter µ can be estimated based on run lengths of single-copy regions. estimates of µ in real data do not exclude the possibility that duplicate gene deletion is largely gene by gene, although it may sometimes involve longer segments.
