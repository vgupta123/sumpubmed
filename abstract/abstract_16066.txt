BACKGROUND
sorghum  is an important dry-land cereal of the world providing food, fodder, feed and fuel. stay-green  is a key attribute in sorghum determining its adaptation to terminal drought stress. the objective of this study was to validate sorghum stay-green quantitative trait loci  identified in the past, and to identify new qtl in the genetic background of a post-rainy adapted genotype m35- <dig> 


RESULTS
a genetic linkage map based on 245 f <dig> recombinant inbred lines  derived from a cross between m35- <dig>  and b <dig>  with  <dig> markers consisting of  <dig> genomic,  <dig> genic and  <dig> morphological markers was used. the phenotypic data collected for three consecutive post-rainy crop seasons on the ril population  was used for qtl analysis. sixty-one qtl were identified for various measures of stay-green trait and each trait was controlled by one to ten qtl. the phenotypic variation explained by each qtl ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. co-localization of qtl for more than five traits was observed on two linkage groups i.e. on sbi-09- <dig> flanked by s <dig> and xgap <dig> markers and, on sbi- <dig> flanked by xnhsbsfcilp <dig> and xtxp <dig>  qtl identified in this study were stable across environments and corresponded to sorghum stay-green and grain yield qtl reported previously. of the  <dig> genic ssrs mapped,  <dig> were closely linked with qtl for ten traits. a genic marker, xnhsbsfcilp <dig>  encoding indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase gh <dig> , was co-located with qtl for glb, glm, pglm and glam on sbi- <dig>  genes underlying key enzymes of chlorophyll metabolism were also found in the stay-green qtl regions.


CONCLUSIONS
we validated important stay-green qtl reported in the past in sorghum and detected new qtl influencing the stay-green related traits consistently. stg <dig>  stg <dig> and stgb were prominent in their expression. collectively, the qtl/markers identified are likely candidates for subsequent verification for their involvement in stay-green phenotype using nils and to develop drought tolerant sorghum varieties through marker-assisted breeding for terminal drought tolerance in sorghum.
