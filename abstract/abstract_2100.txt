BACKGROUND
genetic experiments have clarified that p <dig> is a key transcription factor governing the establishment and maintenance of multilayered epithelia. key to our understanding of p <dig> strategy is the identification of target genes. we perfomed an rnai screening in keratinocytes for p <dig>  followed by profiling analysis.


RESULTS
c/ebpδ, member of a family with known roles in differentiation pathways, emerged as a gene repressed by p <dig>  we validated c/ebpδ as a primary target of Δnp63α by rt-pcr and chip location analysis in hacat and primary cells. c/ebpδ is differentially expressed in stratification of human skin and it is up-regulated upon differentiation of hacat and primary keratinocytes. it is bound to and activates the Δnp <dig> promoter. overexpression of c/ebpδ leads to alteration in the normal profile of p <dig> isoforms, with the emergence of Δnp63β and γ, and of the ta isoforms, with different kinetics. in addition, there are changes in the expression of most p <dig> targets. inactivation of c/ebpδ leads to gene expression modifications, in part due to the concomitant repression of Δnp63α. finally, c/ebpδ is found on the p <dig> targets in vivo by chip analysis, indicating that coregulation is direct.


CONCLUSIONS
our data highlight a coherent cross-talk between these two transcription factors in keratinocytes and a large sharing of common transcriptional targets.
