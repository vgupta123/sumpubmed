BACKGROUND
growth, development, and pigment synthesis in brassica rapa subsp. rapa cv. tsuda, a popular vegetable crop, are influenced by light. although micrornas  have vital roles in the metabolic processes and abiotic stress responses of plants, whether mirnas play a role in anthocyanin biosynthesis and development of tsuda seedlings exposed to light is unknown.


RESULTS
seventeen conserved and  <dig> novel mirnas differed at least 2-fold in response to blue and uv-a light compared with levels after a dark treatment. real time pcr showed that brmir <dig>  brmirc <dig>  brmirc <dig>  brmirc <dig>  brmirc <dig>  brmirc <dig> were blue light-induced and northern blot revealed that the transcription level of brmir <dig> did not differ significantly among seedlings treated with dark, blue or uv-light. brmir <dig> and brmir <dig> were present in the greatest amount  and among their  <dig> putative targets in the spl gene family, only spl <dig>  and spl <dig>  increased in expression after blue or uv-a exposure. in addition, mir157-guided cleavage of target spl <dig> mrnas  and spl <dig> mrnas  took place  <dig> or  <dig> bases from the 5′ ends of the binding region in the mir <dig> sequence.


CONCLUSIONS
a set of mirnas and their targets involved in the regulation of the light-induced photomorphogenic phenotype in seedlings of brassica rapa was identified, providing new insights into blue and uv-a light-responsive mirnas in seedlings of tsuda and evidence of multiple targets for the mirnas and their diverse roles in plant development.
