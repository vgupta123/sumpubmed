BACKGROUND
the promyelocytic leukemia  protein participates in a number of cellular processes, including transcription regulation, apoptosis, differentiation, virus defense and genome maintenance. this protein is structurally organized into a tripartite motif  at its n-terminus, a nuclear localization signal  at its central region and a c-terminus that varies between alternatively spliced isoforms. most pml splice variants target the nucleus where they define sub-nuclear compartments termed pml nuclear bodies . however, pml variants that lack the nls are also expressed, suggesting the existence of pml isoforms with cytoplasmic functions. in the present study we expressed pml isoforms with a mutated nls in u2os cells to identify potential cytoplasmic compartments targeted by this protein.


RESULTS
expression of nls mutated pml isoforms in u2os cells revealed that pml i targets early endosomes, pml ii targets the inner nuclear membrane , and pml iii, iv and v target late endosomes/lysosomes. clustering of pml at all of these subcellular locations depended on a functional trim domain.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates the capacity of pml to form macromolecular protein assemblies at several different subcellular sites. further, it emphasizes a role of the variable c-terminus in subcellular target selection and a general role of the n-terminal trim domain in promoting protein clustering.
