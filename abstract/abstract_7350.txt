BACKGROUND
the programmed cell death  <dig>  gene on mouse chromosome  <dig> was evaluated as a member of a highly conserved synteny, a candidate for an imprinted locus, and a candidate for the hybrid sterility  <dig>  gene.


RESULTS
new mouse transcripts were identified at this locus: an alternative pdcd <dig> mrna skipping the last two coding exons and two classes of antisense rnas. one class of the antisense rna overlaps the alternative exon and the other the entire pdcd <dig> gene. the antisense rnas are alternative transcripts of the neighboring tata-binding protein gene  that are located mainly in the cell nucleus. analogous alternative pdcd <dig> forms truncating the c-terminal domain were also detected in human and chicken. alternative transcripts of the chicken pdcd <dig> and tbp genes also overlap. no correlation in the transcription of the alternative and overlapping mrnas was detected. allelic sequencing and transcription studies did not reveal any support for the candidacy of pdcd <dig> for hst <dig>  no correlated expression of pdcd <dig> with the other two genes of the highly conserved synteny was observed. pdcd <dig>  chd <dig>  and four other genes from this region were not imprinted in the embryo.


CONCLUSIONS
the conservation of alternative transcription of the pdcd <dig> gene in mouse, human and chicken suggests the biological importance of such truncated protein. the biological function of the alternative pdcd <dig> is likely to be opposite to that of the constitutive form. the ratio of the constitutive and alternative pdcd <dig> mrnas differs in the tissues, suggesting a developmental role.

the identified tbp-alternative pdcd2-antisense transcripts may interfere with the transcription of the pdcd <dig> gene, as they are transcribed at a comparable level. the conservation of the pdcd2/tbp sense-antisense overlap in the mouse and chicken points out its biological relevance. our results also suggest that some cdnas in databases labeled as noncoding are incomplete alternative cdnas of neighboring protein-coding genes.
