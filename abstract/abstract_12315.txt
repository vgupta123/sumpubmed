BACKGROUND
mhc class ii proteins bind oligopeptide fragments derived from proteolysis of pathogen antigens, presenting them at the cell surface for recognition by cd4+ t cells. human mhc class ii alleles are grouped into three loci: hla-dp, hla-dq and hla-dr. in contrast to hla-dr and hla-dq, hla-dp proteins have not been studied extensively, as they have been viewed as less important in immune responses than drs and dqs. however, it is now known that hla-dp alleles are associated with many autoimmune diseases. quite recently, the x-ray structure of the hla-dp <dig> molecule  in complex with a self-peptide derived from the hla-dr Î±-chain has been determined. in the present study, we applied a validated molecular docking protocol to a library of  <dig> modelled peptide-dp <dig> complexes, seeking to assess the contribution made by each of the  <dig> naturally occurred amino acids at each of the nine binding core peptide positions and the four flanking residues .


RESULTS
the free binding energies  derived from the docking experiments were normalized on a position-dependent  and on an overall basis , and two docking score-based quantitative matrices  were derived: qmnpp and qmnap. they reveal the amino acid preferences at each of the  <dig> positions considered in the study. apart from the leading role of anchor positions p <dig> and p <dig>  the binding to hla-dp <dig> depends on the preferences at p <dig>  no effect of the flanking residues was found on the peptide binding predictions to dp <dig>  although all four of them show strong preferences for particular amino acids. the predictive ability of the ds-qms was tested using a set of  <dig> known binders to hla-dp <dig>  originating from  <dig> proteins. the sensitivities of the predictions at five different thresholds  were calculated and compared to the predictions made by the netmhcii and iedb servers. analysis of the ds-qms indicated an improvement in performance. additionally, ds-qms identified the binding cores of several known dp <dig> binders.


CONCLUSIONS
the molecular docking protocol, as applied to a combinatorial library of peptides, models the peptide-hla-dp <dig> protein interaction effectively, generating reliable predictions in a quantitative assessment. the method is structure-based and does not require extensive experimental sequence-based data. thus, it is universal and can be applied to model any peptide - protein interaction.
