BACKGROUND
the hydrogenosomes of the anaerobic ciliate nyctotherus ovalis show how
                  mitochondria can evolve into hydrogenosomes because they possess a mitochondrial
                  genome and parts of an electron-transport chain on the one hand, and a hydrogenase
                  on the other hand. the hydrogenase permits direct reoxidation of nadh because it
                  consists of a  hydrogenase module that is fused to two modules, which are
                  homologous to the  <dig> kda and the  <dig> kda subunits of a mitochondrial complex i.


RESULTS
the  hydrogenase belongs to a clade of hydrogenases that are different from
                  well-known eukaryotic hydrogenases. the  <dig> kda and the  <dig> kda modules are most
                  closely related to homologous modules that function in bacterial 
                  hydrogenases. paralogous, mitochondrial  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda modules function in the
                  mitochondrial complex i in n. ovalis. the different hydrogenase modules
                  have been fused to form a polyprotein that is targeted into the hydrogenosome.


CONCLUSIONS
the hydrogenase and their associated modules have most likely been acquired by
                  independent lateral gene transfer from different sources. this scenario for a
                  concerted lateral gene transfer is in agreement with the evolution of the
                  hydrogenosome from a genuine ciliate mitochondrion by evolutionary tinkering.
