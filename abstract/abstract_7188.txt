BACKGROUND
dna replication and transcription are dynamic processes regulating plant development that are dependent on the chromatin accessibility. proteins belonging to the agenet/tudor domain family are known as histone modification “readers” and classified as chromatin remodeling proteins. histone modifications and chromatin remodeling have profound effects on gene expression as well as on dna replication, but how these processes are integrated has not been completely elucidated. it is clear that members of the agenet/tudor family are important regulators of development playing roles not well known in plants.

methods
bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses of the agenet/tudor family domain in the plant kingdom were carried out with sequences from available complete genomes databases. 3d structure predictions of agenet/tudor domains were calculated by i-tasser server. protein interactions were tested in two-hybrid, gst pulldown, semi-in vivo pulldown and tandem affinity purification assays. gene function was studied in a t-dna insertion gabi-line.


RESULTS
in the present work we analyzed the family of agenet/tudor domain proteins in the plant kingdom and we mapped the organization of this family throughout plant evolution. furthermore, we characterized a member from arabidopsis thaliana named aip <dig> that harbors agenet/tudor and duf <dig> domains. aip <dig> interacts with abap <dig>  a plant regulator of dna replication licensing and gene transcription, with a plant histone modification “reader”  and with non modified histones. aip <dig> is expressed in reproductive tissues and its down-regulation delays flower development timing. also, expression of abap <dig> and lhp <dig> target genes were repressed in flower buds of plants with reduced levels of aip <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
aip <dig> is a novel agenet/tudor domain protein in plants that could act as a link between dna replication, transcription and chromatin remodeling during flower development.
