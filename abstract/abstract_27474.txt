BACKGROUND
conventional newcastle disease  vaccination strategies in village chicken production settings is impractical due to shortage of cold-chain, unsuitability of vaccine administration routes and demanding trained personnel and hence affected its adoption. results from earlier works elsewhere showed that the heat stable vaccines such as ndi <dig> are thought to be promising for village chickens. this study investigated the suitability and efficacy of ethiopian cereal grains as carriers for the orally administrated ndi <dig> vaccine in chickens.


RESULTS
of the  <dig> treatment groups, drinking water, cracked maize and parboiled barley induced significantly higher hi antibody titer than the other carrier grains and naive control. the higher mean hi titer of chickens in drinking-water, cracked maize and parboiled barley group resulted in 100 % survival rate. in general, there was an inverse relationship between chicken mortality  and mean hi titer. chickens with higher hi antibody titers had better survival rate to the challenge experiment. booster vaccination at age of day  <dig> and  <dig> induced progressively higher hi antibodies titers in all treatment groups.


CONCLUSIONS
vaccine coated parboiled grains could be a good carrier followed by cracked grains while untreated vaccine carrier grains had lower serological responses and protection levels. the current finding gives insights on suitable vaccine delivery system in villages with weak health and transportation infrastructure, unreliable electricity, and minimally trained health workers without catching chickens individually.
