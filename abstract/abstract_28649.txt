BACKGROUND
the distribution area of pearl millet in west and central africa  harbours a wide range of climatic and environmental conditions as well as diverse farmer preferences and pearl millet utilization habits which have the potential to lead to local adaptation and thereby to population structure. the objectives of our research were to  assess the geographical distribution of genetic diversity in pearl millet inbreds derived from landraces,  assess the population structure of pearl millet from wca, and  identify those geographical parameters and environmental factors from the location at which landraces were sampled, as well as those phenotypic traits that may have affected or led to this population structure. our study was based on a set of  <dig> inbred lines derived from  <dig> different pearl millet landraces from wca.


RESULTS
five sub-groups were detected within the entire germplasm set by structure. we observed that the phenotypic traits flowering time, relative response to photoperiod, and panicle length were significantly associated with population structure but not the environmental factors which are expected to influence these traits in natural populations such as latitude, temperature, or precipitation.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggested that for pearl millet natural selection is compared to artificial selection less important in shaping populations.
