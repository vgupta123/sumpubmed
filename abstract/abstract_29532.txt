BACKGROUND
disorazoles are polyene macrodiolides isolated from a myxobacterium fermentation broth. disorazole c <dig> was newly synthesized and found to depolymerize microtubules and cause mitotic arrest. here we examined the cellular responses to disorazole c <dig> in both non-cancer and cancer cells and compared our results to vinblastine and taxol.


RESULTS
in non-cancer cells, disorazole c <dig> induced a prolonged mitotic arrest, followed by mitotic slippage, as confirmed by live cell imaging and cell cycle analysis. this mitotic slippage was associated with cyclin b degradation, but did not require p <dig>  four assays for apoptosis, including western blotting for poly polymerase cleavage, microscopic analyses for cytochrome c release and annexin v staining, and gel electrophoresis examination for dna laddering, were conducted and demonstrated little induction of apoptosis in non-cancer cells treated with disorazole c <dig>  on the contrary, we observed an activated apoptotic pathway in cancer cells, suggesting that normal and malignant cells respond differently to disorazole c <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our studies demonstrate that non-cancer cells undergo mitotic slippage in a cyclin b-dependent and p53-independent manner after prolonged mitotic arrest caused by disorazole c <dig>  in contrast, cancer cells induce the apoptotic pathway after disorazole c <dig> treatment, indicating a possibly significant therapeutic window for this compound.
