BACKGROUND
filamentous m <dig> phage extrude from infected escherichia coli with a tip structure composed of gp <dig> and gp <dig>  this tip structure is extended by the assembly of the filament composed of the major coat protein gp <dig>  finally, gp <dig> and gp <dig> terminate the phage structure at the proximal end. up to now, gp <dig> has been the primary tool for phage display technology. however, gp <dig>  gp <dig> and gp <dig> could also be used for phage display and these phage particles should bind to two different or more surfaces when the modified coat proteins are combined. therefore, we tested here if the amino-terminal end of gp <dig> can be modified and whether the modified portion is exposed and detectable on the m <dig> phage particles.


RESULTS
the amino-terminal region of gp <dig> was modified by inserting short sequences that encode antigenic epitopes. we show here that the modified gp <dig> proteins correctly integrate into the membrane using the membrane insertase yidc exposing the modified epitope into the periplasm. the proteins are then efficiently assembled onto the phage particles. also extensions up to  <dig> amino acid residues at the amino-terminal end of gp <dig> did not interfere with membrane integration and phage assembly. the exposure of the antigenic tags on the phage was visualised with immunogold labelling by electron microscopy and verified by dot blotting with antibodies to the tags.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that gp <dig> at the phage tip is suitable for the phage display technology. the modified gp <dig> can be supplied in trans from a plasmid and fully complements m <dig> phage with an amber mutation in gene  <dig>  the modified phage tip is very well accessible to antibodies.
