BACKGROUND
although hizentra is indicated for immunoglobulin replacement therapy in patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, phase iii trials have focused on patients with primary immunodeficiencies. in this 9-month, real-life, prospective, non-interventional, longitudinal, multicenter study of patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies in france, treatment modalities , efficacy, safety, tolerability, quality of life, and treatment satisfaction were evaluated using descriptive statistics.


RESULTS
starting in january  <dig>   <dig> patients were enrolled . secondary immunodeficiencies were present in  <dig>  % of patients. at follow-up, injections were administered every 7 days in  <dig>  % of patients. nine patients  were taking hizentra every 10– <dig> days. the median dose of hizentra administered was  <dig>  g/kg/injection. fifty-six patients were administered doses < <dig>  g/kg/injection and  <dig> patients were administered doses > <dig>  g/kg/injection. mean trough igg titers were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l . the mean yearly rate of infection was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . mean scores on the short form- <dig> physical and mental component summaries were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. scores on the treatment satisfaction questionnaire for medication ranged from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  depending on the domain. treatment with hizentra was well tolerated. no single drug-related systemic reaction occurred in more than one patient and few local reactions were reported .


CONCLUSIONS
under real-life conditions and in a cohort that included patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, treatment with hizentra was effective and well tolerated and patients were generally satisfied with the treatment.
