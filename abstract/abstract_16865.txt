BACKGROUND
for most cruciferous plants, which are known as important crops and a number of weeds, hybrid breeding is hampered by the unavailability of a pollination control system. male sterility induced by a gametocide can be useful for the utilization of plant heterosis.


RESULTS
the gametocidal effect of sulfonylurea herbicide tribenuron-methyl was tested across seventeen cruciferous species or subspecies including brassica juncea, b. carinata, b. oleracea ssp. capitata, b. oleracea ssp. acephala, b. rapa ssp. pekinensis, b. rapa ssp. chinensis, b. rapa ssp. parachinensis, b. nigra, orychophragmus violaceus, matthiola incana, raphanus sativa, sisymbrium altissimum, eruca sativa, sinapis alba, sinapis arvensis, capsella bursa-pastoris and camelina sativa. the plants of  <dig> cultivars in these species or subspecies were foliar sprayed with 10 ml of  <dig>  or  <dig>  mg/l of tribenuron-methyl before the vacuolated microspore formed in the largest flower buds; the application was repeated ten to twelve days afterwards. tribenuron-methyl exposure significantly changed the flowering phenology and reproductive function. the treated plants demonstrated a one to four day delay in flowering time and a shortened duration of flowering, as well as other slight phytotoxic effects including a reduction in plant height and floral organ size. approximately 80% to 100% male sterility, which was estimated by both pollen staining and selfing seed-set rate, was induced in the plants. as a result, plants were rendered functionally able to out-cross, with an average 87% and 54% manually pollinated seed-set rate compared to the corresponding controls at the  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  mg/l doses, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggested that male reproductive function was much more sensitive to tribenuron-methyl exposure than female function. this sulfonylurea herbicide has a promising use as the gametocide for hybrid production in cruciferous plants.
