BACKGROUND
we investigate the evolving molecular epidemiology of metallo-β-lactamase -producing pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates collected in a  <dig> institution, nationwide surveillance study in japan from  <dig> to  <dig> 


RESULTS
mbl-producers were detected in 23/ <dig> isolates  in  <dig> and 21/ <dig>  in  <dig>  antimicrobial resistance  rates between two periods did not differ significantly. mbl-producers were more prevalent in urinary tract isolates. blaimp- <dig> group was the most predominant , followed by  <dig> blaimp- <dig>   <dig> blaimp- <dig> group, and  <dig> blavim- <dig>  all mbl genes were identified in  <dig> different class  <dig> integrons, most of which were novel to integrall database. a total of  <dig> isolates of sequence type   <dig>  a recognized worldwide drug-resistant lineage, were distributed in  <dig> geographic regions across japan. st <dig> isolates included a sublineage associated with in113-like integron. st <dig> was identified in  <dig> isolates,  <dig> of which harboring a sole blaimp- <dig> gene cassette  were recovered from chugoku region in  <dig>  st <dig> isolates with blaimp- <dig> group or st <dig> with blaimp- <dig> emerged in  <dig>  we also report for the first time the presence of novel fosi gene cassette in strains other than mycobacterium spp.


CONCLUSIONS
our data give an important “snapshot” of the molecular characteristics and dynamics of mbl-producing lineages in p. aeruginosa in japan. the significant association of specific genotypes and integrons implies that dissemination and transmission of the preexisting resistant lineage, rather than horizontal gene transfer in situ, might largely explain their endemicity.
