BACKGROUND
cowpea  is an important food and fodder legume of the semiarid tropics and subtropics worldwide, especially in sub-saharan africa. high density genetic linkage maps are needed for marker assisted breeding but are not available for cowpea. a single feature polymorphism  is a microarray-based marker which can be used for high throughput genotyping and high density mapping.


RESULTS
here we report detection and validation of sfps in cowpea using a readily available soybean  genome array. robustified projection pursuit  was used for statistical analysis using rna as a surrogate for dna. using a 15% outlying score cut-off,  <dig> potential sfps were enumerated between two parents of a recombinant inbred line  population segregating for several important traits including drought tolerance, fusarium and brown blotch resistance, grain size and photoperiod sensitivity. sequencing of  <dig> putative polymorphism-containing amplicons yielded a sfp probe set validation rate of 68%.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the affymetrix soybean genome array is a satisfactory platform for identification of some 1000's of sfps for cowpea. this study provides an example of extension of genomic resources from a well supported species to an orphan crop. presumably, other legume systems are similarly tractable to sfp marker development using existing legume array resources.
