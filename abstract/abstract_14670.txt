BACKGROUND
dwarf cottons are more resistant to damage from wind and rain and associated with stable, increased yields, and also desirable source for breeding the machine harvest varieties. in an effort to uncover the transcripts and mirna networks involved in plant height, the transcriptome and small rna sequencing were performed based on dwarf mutant ari <dig> , tall-culm mutant ari <dig>  and wild type ari <dig>  in gossypium hirsutum.

methods
the stem apexes of wild-type upland cotton  and its dwarf mutant  and tall-culm mutant  at the fifth true leaf stage were extracted for rna, respectively. transcriptome and small rna libraries were constructed and subjected to next generation sequencing.


RESULTS
the transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that the enriched pathways of top  <dig> differentially expressed genes  were categorized as carotenoid biosynthesis, plant-pathogen interaction and plant hormone signal transduction in both a1–a <dig> and a3–a <dig>  the aba and iaa related factors were differentially expressed in the mutants. importantly, we found the lower expressed saur and elevated expressed gh <dig>  and aba related genes such as nced and pp2c maybe relate to reduced growth of the plant height in ari <dig> which was consistent with the higher auxin and aba content in this mutant. furthermore, mirna <dig> targeted to the auxin response factor  and mirna <dig>  targeted to aba responsive element binding factor were related to the mutation in cotton. we have noticed that the cell growth related factors , the redox reactions related factors  and myb genes targeted by mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were also involved in plant height of the cotton mutants. a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas representing  <dig> known mirna families were obtained, and  <dig> novel mirnas corresponding to  <dig> unique rna sequences were identified. total  <dig> targets for  <dig> conserved mirnas were obtained. using paresnip,  <dig> and  <dig> mirna/target conserved interactions were validated in a1–a <dig> and a3–a <dig>  respectively. furthermore, mirna <dig>  mirna <dig> and mirna <dig> were validated to be up-regulated in a1–a <dig> but down-regulated in a3–a <dig>  whereas mirna <dig> showed the opposite regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
this comprehensive interaction of the transcriptome and mirna at tall-culm and dwarf mutant led to the discovery of regulatory mechanisms in plant height. it also provides the basis for in depth analyses of dwarf mutant genes for further breeding of dwarf cotton.
