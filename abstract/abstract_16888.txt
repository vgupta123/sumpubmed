BACKGROUND
human blood platelets are essential to maintaining normal hemostasis, and platelet dysfunction often causes bleeding or thrombosis. estimates of genome-wide platelet rna expression using microarrays have provided insights to the platelet transcriptome but were limited by the number of known transcripts. the goal of this effort was to deep-sequence rna from leukocyte-depleted platelets to capture the complex profile of all expressed transcripts.


RESULTS
from each of four healthy individuals we generated long rna  profiles from total and ribosomal-rna depleted rna preparations, as well as short rna  profiles. analysis of ~ <dig> billion reads revealed that coding and non-coding platelet transcripts span a very wide dynamic range , a result we validated through qrt-pcr on many dozens of platelet messenger rnas. surprisingly, ribosomal-rna depletion significantly and adversely affected estimates of the relative abundance of transcripts. of the known protein-coding loci, ~ <dig>  are present in human platelets. we observed a strong correlation between mrnas identified by rna-seq and microarray for well-expressed mrnas, but rnaseq identified many more transcripts of lower abundance and permitted discovery of novel transcripts.


CONCLUSIONS
our analyses revealed diverse classes of non-coding rnas, including: pervasive antisense transcripts to protein-coding loci; numerous, previously unreported and abundant micrornas; retrotransposons; and thousands of novel un-annotated long and short intronic transcripts, an intriguing finding considering the anucleate nature of platelets. the data are available through a local mirror of the ucsc genome browser and can be accessed at:
