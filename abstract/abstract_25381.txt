BACKGROUND
in mammals, sex determination is genetically controlled. the sry gene, located on y chromosome, functions as the dominant genetic switch for testis development. the sry gene is specifically expressed in a subpopulation of somatic cells  of the developing urogenital ridge for a brief period during gonadal differentiation. despite this tight spatiotemporal expression pattern, the molecular mechanisms that regulate sry transcription remain poorly understood. sry expression has been shown to be markedly reduced in transgenic mice harboring a mutant gata <dig> protein  disrupted in its ability to interact with its transcriptional partner fog <dig>  suggesting that gata <dig> is involved in sry gene transcription.


RESULTS
although our results show that gata <dig> directly targets the pig sry promoter, we did not observe similar action on the mouse and human sry promoters. in the mouse, wilms' tumor  <dig>  is an important regulator of both sry and m√ºllerian inhibiting substance  expression and in humans, wt <dig> mutations are associated with abnormalities of sex differentiation. gata <dig> transcriptionally cooperated with wt <dig> on the mouse, pig, and human sry promoters. maximal gata4/wt <dig> synergism was dependent on wt <dig> but not gata <dig> binding to their consensus regulatory elements in the sry promoter and required both the zinc finger and c-terminal regions of the gata <dig> protein. although both isoforms of wt <dig> synergized with gata <dig>  synergism was stronger with the +kts rather than the -kts isoform. wt1/gata <dig> synergism was also observed on the amh promoter. in contrast to sry, wt1/gata <dig> action on the mouse amh promoter was specific for the -kts isoform and required both wt <dig> and gata <dig> binding.


CONCLUSIONS
our data therefore provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the tissue-specific expression of the sry and amh genes in both normal development and certain syndromes of abnormal sex differentiation.
