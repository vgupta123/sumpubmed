BACKGROUND
previous electrophysiological studies have identified a "voice specific response"  peaking around  <dig> ms after stimulus onset, a latency markedly longer than the  <dig> ms needed to discriminate living from non-living sound sources and the  <dig> ms to  <dig> ms needed for the processing of voice paralinguistic qualities. in the present study, we investigated whether an early electrophysiological difference between voice and non-voice stimuli could be observed.


RESULTS
erps were recorded from  <dig> healthy volunteers who listened to  <dig> ms long stimuli from three sound categories - voices, bird songs and environmental sounds - whilst performing a pure-tone detection task. erp analyses revealed voice/non-voice amplitude differences emerging as early as  <dig> ms post stimulus onset and peaking around  <dig> ms on fronto-temporal  and occipital  electrodes.


CONCLUSIONS
our electrophysiological results suggest a rapid brain discrimination of sounds of voice, termed the "fronto-temporal positivity to voices" , at latencies comparable to the well-known face-preferential n <dig>
