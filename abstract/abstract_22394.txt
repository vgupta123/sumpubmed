BACKGROUND
pseudomonas fluorescens strain mfe <dig> secretes in abundance two hcp proteins  hcp <dig> and hcp <dig>  characteristic of a functional type  <dig> secretion system. phenotypic studies have shown that mfe <dig> has antibacterial activity against a wide range of competitor bacteria, including rhizobacteria and clinically relevant bacteria. mutagenesis of the hcp <dig> gene abolishes or reduces, depending on the target strain, mfe <dig> antibacterial activity. hcp <dig>  encoded by hcp <dig>  may also be involved in bacterial competition. we therefore assessed the contribution of hcp <dig> to competition of p. fluorescens mfe <dig> with other bacteria, by studying mfe <dig> mutants in various competitive conditions.


RESULTS
mutation of hcp <dig> had pleiotropic effects on the mfe <dig> phenotype. it affected mucoidy of the strain and its motility and was associated with the loss of flagella, which were restored by introduction of plasmid expressing hcp <dig>  the hcp <dig> mutation had no effect on bacterial competition during incubation in solid medium. mfe <dig> was able to sequester another p. fluorescens strain, mfn <dig>  under swimming conditions. the hcp <dig> mutant but not the hcp <dig> mutant conserved this ability. in competition assays on swarming medium, mfe <dig> impaired mfn <dig> swarming and displayed killing activity. the hcp <dig> mutant, but not the hcp <dig> mutant, was able to reduce mfn <dig> swarming. the hcp <dig> and hcp <dig> mutations each abolished killing activity in these conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings implicate type  <dig> secretion of hcp <dig> in mucoidy and motility of mfe <dig>  our study is the first to establish a link between a type  <dig> secretion system and flagellin and mucoidy. hcp <dig> also appears to contribute to limiting the motility of prey cells to facilitate killing mediated by hcp <dig>  inhibition of motility associated with an hcp protein has never been described. with this work, we illustrate the importance and versatility of type  <dig> secretion systems in bacterial adaptation and fitness.
