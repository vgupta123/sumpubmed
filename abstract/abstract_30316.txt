BACKGROUND
in both schizophrenia and addiction, pathological changes in dopamine release appear to induce alterations in the circuitry of the nucleus accumbens that affect coordinated thought and motivation. dopamine acts principally on medium-spiny gaba neurons, which comprise 95% of accumbens neurons and give rise to the majority of inhibitory synapses in the nucleus. to examine dopamine action at single medium-spiny neuron synapses, we imaged ca2+ levels in their presynaptic varicosities in the acute brain slice using two-photon microscopy.


RESULTS
presynaptic ca2+ rises were differentially modulated by dopamine. the d1/d <dig> selective agonist skf <dig> was exclusively facilitatory. the d2/d <dig> selective agonist quinpirole was predominantly inhibitory, but in some instances it was facilitatory. studies using d <dig> and d <dig> receptor knockout mice revealed that quinpirole inhibition was either d <dig> or d <dig> receptor-mediated, while facilitation was mainly d <dig> receptor-mediated. subsets of varicosities responded to both d <dig> and d <dig> agonists, showing that there was significant co-expression of these receptor families in single medium-spiny neurons. neighboring presynaptic varicosities showed strikingly heterogeneous responses to da agonists, suggesting that da receptors may be differentially trafficked to individual varicosities on the same medium-spiny neuron axon.


CONCLUSIONS
dopamine receptors are present on the presynaptic varicosities of medium-spiny neurons, where they potently control gabaergic synaptic transmission. while there is significant coexpression of d <dig> and d <dig> family dopamine receptors in individual neurons, at the subcellular level, these receptors appear to be heterogeneously distributed, potentially explaining the considerable controversy regarding dopamine action in the striatum, and in particular the degree of dopamine receptor segregation on these neurons. assuming that post-receptor signaling is restricted to the microdomains of medium-spiny neuron varicosities, the heterogeneous distribution of dopamine receptors on individual varicosities is likely to encode patterns in striatal information processing.
