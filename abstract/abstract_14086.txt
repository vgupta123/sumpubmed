BACKGROUND
b-thalassaemia and sickle cell disease  are two of the most common monogenic diseases that are found in many populations worldwide. in both disorders the clinical severity is highly variable, with the persistence of fetal haemoglobin  being one of the major ameliorating factors. hbf levels are affected by, amongst other factors, single nucleotide polymorphisms  at the bcl11a gene and the hbs1l-myb intergenic region, which are located outside the Î²-globin locus. for this reason, we developed two multiplex assays that allow the genotyping of snps at these two genomic regions which have been shown to be associated with variable hbf levels in different populations.


RESULTS
two multiplex assays based on the snapshot minisequencing approach were developed. the two assays can be used to simultaneous genotype twelve snps at the bcl11a gene and sixteen snps at hbs1l-myb intergenic region which were shown to modify hbf levels. the different genotypes can be determined based on the position and the fluorescent colour of the peaks in a single electropherogram. dna sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism  assays were used to verify genotyping results obtained by snapshot minisequencing.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we propose two multiplex assays based on the snapshot minisequencing approach for the simultaneous identification of snps located at the bcl11a gene and hbs1l-myb intergenic region which have an effect on hbf levels. the assays can be easily applied for accurate, time and cost efficient genotyping of the selected snps in various populations.
