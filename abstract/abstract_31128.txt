BACKGROUND
germline mutations or large-scale deletions in the coding region and splice sites of stk11/lkb <dig> do not account for all cases of peutz-jeghers syndrome . it is conceivable that, on the basis of data from other diseases, inherited variation in promoter elements of stk11/lkb <dig> may cause pjs.


RESULTS
phylogenetic foot printing and transcription factor binding site prediction of sequence 5' to the coding sequence of stk11/lkb <dig> was performed to identify non-coding sequences of dna indicative of regulatory elements. a series of  <dig> pjs cases in whom no mutation in stk11/lkb <dig> could be identified were screened for sequence changes in the putative promoter defined by nucleotides - <dig> to - <dig>  two novel sequence changes were identified, but were found to be present in healthy individuals.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings indicate that promoter sequence changes are unlikely to contribute to pjs.
