BACKGROUND
for treating a complex disease such as cancer, we need effective means to control the biological network that underlies the disease. however, biological networks are typically robust to external perturbations, making it difficult to beneficially alter the network dynamics by controlling a single target. in fact, multi-target therapeutics is often more effective compared to monotherapies, and combinatory drugs are commonly used these days for treating various diseases. a practical challenge in combination therapy is that the number of possible drug combinations increases exponentially, which makes the prediction of the optimal drug combination a difficult combinatorial optimization problem. recently, a stochastic optimization algorithm called the gur game algorithm was proposed for drug optimization, which was shown to be very efficient in finding potent drug combinations.


RESULTS
in this paper, we propose a novel stochastic optimization algorithm that can be used for effective optimization of combinatory drugs. the proposed algorithm analyzes how the concentration change of a specific drug affects the overall drug response, thereby making an informed guess on how the concentration should be updated to improve the drug response. we evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm based on various drug response functions, and compared it with the gur game algorithm.


CONCLUSIONS
numerical experiments clearly show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the original gur game algorithm, in terms of reliability and efficiency. this enhanced optimization algorithm can provide an effective framework for identifying potent drug combinations that lead to optimal drug response.
