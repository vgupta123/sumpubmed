BACKGROUND
whole genome amplification  promises to eliminate practical molecular genetic analysis limitations associated with genomic dna  quantity. we evaluated the performance of multiple displacement amplification  wga using gdna extracted from lymphoblastoid cell lines  with a range of starting gdna input of 1– <dig> ng into the wga reaction. yield and composition analysis of whole genome amplified dna  was performed using three dna quantification methods . two panels of n =  <dig> str  and n =  <dig> snp  genotyping assays were performed on each gdna and wgadna sample in duplicate. gdna and wgadna masses of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ng were used in the snp assays to evaluate the effects of dna mass on snp genotyping assay performance. a total of n =  <dig>  str and n =  <dig>  snp genotype attempts provided adequate power to detect differences in str and snp genotyping performance between gdna and wgadna, and among wgadna produced from a range of gdna templates inputs.


RESULTS
the proportion of double-stranded wgadna and human-specific pcr amplifiable wgadna increased with increased gdna input into the wga reaction. increased amounts of gdna input into the wga reaction improved wgadna genotyping performance. genotype completion or genotype concordance rates of wgadna produced from all gdna input levels were observed to be reduced compared to gdna, although the reduction was not always statistically significant. reduced wgadna genotyping performance was primarily due to the increased variance of allelic amplification, resulting in loss of heterozygosity or increased undetermined genotypes. mda wga produces wgadna from no template control samples; such samples exhibited substantial false-positive genotyping rates.


CONCLUSIONS
the amount of gdna input into the mda wga reaction is a critical determinant of genotyping performance of wgadna. at least  <dig> ng of lymphoblastoid gdna input into mda wga is required to obtain wgadna taqman® snp assay genotyping performance equivalent to that of gdna. over  <dig> ng of lymphoblastoid gdna input into mda wga is required to obtain optimal str genotyping performance using the ampflstr® identifiler® panel from wgadna equivalent to that of gdna.
