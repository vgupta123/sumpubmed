BACKGROUND
cell transdifferentiation is characterized by loss of some phenotypes along with acquisition of new phenotypes in differentiated cells. the differentiated state of a given cell is not irreversible. it depends on the up- and downregulation exerted by specific molecules.


RESULTS
we report here that hccr- <dig>  previously shown to play an oncogenic role in human cancers, induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition  in human and mouse, respectively. the stem cell factor receptor cd117/c-kit was induced in this transdifferentiated  sarcoma tissues. this met occurring in hccr- <dig> transfected cells is reminiscent of the transdifferentiation process during nephrogenesis. indeed, expression of hccr- <dig> was observed during the embryonic development of the kidney. this suggests that hccr- <dig> might be involved in the transdifferentiation process of cancer stem cell.


CONCLUSIONS
therefore, we propose that hccr- <dig> may be a regulatory factor that stimulates morphogenesis of epithelia or mesenchyme during neoplastic transformation.
