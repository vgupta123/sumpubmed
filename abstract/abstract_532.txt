BACKGROUND
small secreted proteins  are employed by plant pathogenic fungi as essential strategic tools for their successful colonization. ssps are often species-specific and so far only a few widely phylogenetically distributed ssps have been identified.


RESULTS
a novel fungal ssp family consisting of  <dig> members was identified in the poplar tree fungal pathogen marssonina brunnea, which accounts for over 17% of its secretome. we named these proteins igy proteins  based on the conserved three amino acids at the n-terminus. in spite of overall low sequence similarity among igyps; they showed conserved n- and c-terminal motifs and a unified gene structure. by rt-pcr-seq, we analyzed the igyp gene models and validated their expressions as active genes during infection. igyp homologues were also found in  <dig> other dikarya fungal species, all of which shared conserved motifs and the same gene structure. furthermore,  <dig> igyps from  <dig> fungi also shared similar genomic contexts. real-time rt-pcr showed that  <dig> mbigyps were highly expressed in the biotrophic stage. interestingly, transient assay of  <dig> mbigyps showed that the mbigyp <dig> protein induced cell death in resistant poplar clones.


CONCLUSIONS
in total,  <dig> igyps in  <dig> fungi of the dikarya subkingdom were discovered. gene structure and genomic context analyses indicated that igyps originated from a common ancestor. in m. brunnea, the expansion of highly divergent mbigyps possibly is associated with plant-pathogen arms race.
