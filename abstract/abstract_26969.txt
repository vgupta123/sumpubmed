BACKGROUND
neurovirulent venezuelan equine encephalitis virus  causes lethal encephalitis in equines and is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. veev is highly infectious when transmitted by aerosol and has been developed as a bio-warfare agent, making it an important pathogen to study from a military and civilian standpoint. molecular mechanisms of vee pathogenesis are poorly understood. to study these, the gene expression profile of veev infected mouse brains was investigated. changes in gene expression were correlated with histological changes in the brain. in addition, a molecular framework of changes in gene expression associated with progression of the disease was studied.


RESULTS
our results demonstrate that genes related to important immune pathways such as antigen presentation, inflammation, apoptosis and response to virus  were upregulated as a result of virus infection. the number of over-expressed genes  increased as the disease progressed .


CONCLUSIONS
identification of differentially expressed genes in brain will help in the understanding of veev-induced pathogenesis and selection of biomarkers for diagnosis and targeted therapy of veev-induced neurodegeneration.
