BACKGROUND
the arabidopsis thaliana constitutive expressor of pathogenesis-related genes <dig>  gene has been previously implicated in disease resistance, cell proliferation, cell death, and sugar sensing, and encodes a putative membrane protein of unknown biochemical function. trichome development is also affected in cpr <dig> plants, which have leaf trichomes that are reduced in size and branch number.


RESULTS
in the work presented here, the role of cpr <dig> in trichome development was examined. trichomes on cpr <dig> mutants had reduced birefringence, suggesting a difference in cell wall structure between cpr <dig> and wild-type trichomes. consistent with this, leaf cell walls of cpr <dig> plants contained significantly less paracrystalline cellulose and had an altered wall carbohydrate composition. we also found that the effects of cpr <dig> on trichome size and endoreplication of trichome nuclear dna were epistatic to the effects of mutations in triptychon  or overexpression of glabra <dig>  indicating that these trichome developmental regulators are dependant on cpr <dig> function for their effects on trichome expansion and endoreplication.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that cpr <dig> is unlikely to be a specific regulator of pathogen response pathways or senescence, but rather functions either in cell wall biogenesis or in multiple cell signaling or transcription response pathways.
