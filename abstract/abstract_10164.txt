BACKGROUND
the activity of eukaryotic dna polymerase delta  plays an essential role in genome stability through its effects on dna replication and repair. the p <dig> catalytic subunit of pol δ is encoded by pold <dig> gene in human cells. to clarify biological functions of pold <dig>  we investigated the effects of pold <dig> overexpression or downregulation on cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, dna synthesis and oxidative dna damage induced by h2o <dig> 

methods
hek <dig> cells were transfected with pold <dig> expression plasmid or shrna, cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and dna synthesis in hek <dig> cells were analyzed.


RESULTS
hek <dig> cells were transfected with pold <dig> expression plasmid or shrna. pold <dig> downregulation by shrna suppressed cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and dna synthesis in hek <dig> cells. however, pold <dig> overexpression had no significant effects on these processes. finally, comet assay showed that pold <dig> downregulation led to increased dna damage.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that human pold <dig> plays important role in the regulation of cell cycle progression and dna damage repair.
