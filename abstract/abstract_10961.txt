BACKGROUND
although agmatine therapy in a mouse model of transient focal cerebral ischemia is highly protective against neurological injury, the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of agmatine are not fully elucidated. this study aimed to investigate the effects of agmatine on brain apoptosis, astrogliosis and edema in the rats with transient cerebral ischemia.

methods
following surgical induction of middle cerebral artery occlusion  for  <dig> min, agmatine  was injected  <dig> min after beginning of reperfusion and again once daily for the next  <dig> post-operative days. four days after reperfusion, both motor and proprioception functions were assessed and then all rats were sacrificed for determination of brain infarct volume , apoptosis , edema , gliosis , and neurotoxicity .


RESULTS
the results showed that agmatine treatment was found to accelerate recovery of motor  and proprioception  deficits and to prevent brain infarction , gliosis , edema , apoptosis , and neurotoxicity  during mcao ischemic injury in rats.


CONCLUSIONS
the data suggest that agmatine may improve outcomes of transient cerebral ischemia in rats by reducing brain apoptosis, astrogliosis and edema.
