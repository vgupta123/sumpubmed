BACKGROUND
histone deacetylases  are key enzymes catalyzing the removal of acetyl groups from histones. hdacs act in concert with histone acetyltransferases  to regulate histone acetylation status, which modifies chromatin structure, affecting gene transcription and thus regulating multiple biological processes such as plant growth and development. over a decade, certain hdacs in herbaceous plants have been deeply studied. however, functions of hdacs in woody plants are not well understood.


RESULTS
histone deacetylase specific inhibitor trichostatin a  was used to investigate the role of hdacs in organogenesis of roots and root development in populus trochocarpa. the adventitious roots were regenerated and grown on medium supplemented with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  μm tsa. tsa treatment delayed root regeneration and inhibited primary root growth. to examine the genes modified by tsa in the regenerated roots, tag-based digital gene expression  analysis was performed using illumina hiseqtm  <dig>  approximately  <dig>  million total clean tags were mapped per library. the distinct clean tags for the three libraries corresponding to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  μm tsa treatment were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  from which  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % were mapped unambiguously to the unigene database, respectively. most of the tags were expressed at similar levels, showing a < 5-fold difference after 1 μm and  <dig>  μm tsa treatments and the maximum fold-change of the tag copy number was around  <dig>  the expression levels of many genes in roots were significantly altered by tsa. a total of  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated after 1 μm tsa treatment, while  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated after  <dig>  μm tsa treatment. gene ontology  and pathway analyses indicated that the differentially expressed genes were related to many kinds of molecular functions and biological processes. the genes encoding key enzymes catalyzing gibberellin biosynthesis were significantly down-regulated in the roots exposed to  <dig>  μm tsa and their expression changes were validated by using real-time pcr.


CONCLUSIONS
hdacs were required for de novo organogenesis and normal growth of populus roots. dge data provides the gene profiles in roots probably regulated by histone acetylation during root growth and development, which will lead to a better understanding of the mechanism controlling root development.
