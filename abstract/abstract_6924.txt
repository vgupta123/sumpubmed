BACKGROUND
lettuce  is the major crop from the group of leafy vegetables. several types of molecular markers were developed that are effectively used in lettuce breeding and genetic studies. however only a very limited number of microsattelite-based markers are publicly available. we have employed the method of enriched microsatellite libraries to develop  <dig> genomic ssr markers.


RESULTS
testing of newly developed markers on a set of  <dig> lactuca accession  revealed that both the genetic heterozygosity  and the number of loci per ssr  are significantly higher for genomic ssr markers than for previously developed est-based ssr markers . fifty-four genomic ssr markers were placed on the molecular linkage map of lettuce. distribution of markers in the genome appeared to be random, with the exception of possible cluster on linkage group  <dig>  any combination of  <dig> genomic ssrs was able to distinguish genotypes of all  <dig> accessions. fourteen of newly developed ssr markers originate from fragments with high sequence similarity to resistance gene candidates  and rgc pseudogenes. analysis of molecular variance  of l. sativa accessions showed that approximately 3% of genetic diversity was within accessions, 79% among accessions, and 18% among horticultural types.


CONCLUSIONS
the newly developed genomic ssr markers were added to the pool of previously developed est-ssrs markers. these two types of ssr-based markers provide useful tools for lettuce cultivar fingerprinting, development of integrated molecular linkage maps, and mapping of genes.
