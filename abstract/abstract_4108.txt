BACKGROUND
previous studies compared evoked potentials  between several sleep stages but only one uniform wake state. however, using electroencephalography , several arousal states can be distinguished before sleep onset. recently, the vigilance algorithm leipzig  has been developed, which automatically attributes one out of seven eeg-vigilance stages to each 1-s eeg segment, ranging from stage  <dig> , to stages a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> , to stages b <dig> and b2/ <dig>  up to stage c . applying vigall, we specified the effects of these finely differentiated eeg-vigilance stages  on eps  and behavioral performance. subjects underwent an ignored and attended condition of a 2-h eyes-closed oddball-task. final analysis included  <dig> subjects in the ignored and  <dig> subjects in the attended condition. first, the effect of brain arousal states on eps and performance parameters were analyzed between eeg-vigilance stages a , b <dig> and b2/3&c . then, in a second step, the effects of the finely differentiated eeg-vigilance stages were further specified.


RESULTS
comparing stages a versus b <dig> versus b2/3&c, a significant effect of eeg-vigilance stages on all behavioral parameters and all eps, with exception of mmn and p <dig>  was found. by applying vigall, a more detailed view of arousal effects on ep and performance was possible, such as the finding that the p <dig> showed no further significant increase in stages deeper than b <dig>  stage  <dig> did not differ from any of the a-stages. within more fine-graded stages, such as the a-substages, eps and performance only partially differed. however, these analyses were partly based on small sample sizes and future studies should take effort to get enough epochs of rare stages .


CONCLUSIONS
a clear impact of arousal on eps and behavioral performance was obtained, which emphasize the necessity to consider arousal effects when interpreting eps.
