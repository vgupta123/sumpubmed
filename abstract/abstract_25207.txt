BACKGROUND
skip is a transcription cofactor in many eukaryotes. it can regulate plant stress tolerance in rice and arabidopsis. but the homolog of skip protein in soybean has been not reported up to now.


RESULTS
in this study, the expression patterns of soybean gamyb binding protein gene  encoding a homolog of skip protein were analyzed in soybean under abiotic stresses and different day lengths. the expression of gmgbp <dig> was induced by polyethyleneglycol  <dig>  nacl, gibberellin, abscisic acid and heat stress. gmgbp <dig> had transcriptional activity in c-terminal. gmgbp <dig> could interact with r2r <dig> domain of gmgamyb <dig> in skip domain to take part in gibberellin flowering pathway. in long-day  condition, transgenic arabidopsis with the ectopic overexpression of gmgbp <dig> exhibited earlier flowering and less number of rosette leaves; suppression of atskip in arabidopsis resulted in growth arrest, flowering delay and down-regulation of many flowering-related genes ; arabidopsis myb <dig> mutant plants with ectopic overexpression of gmgbp <dig> showed the same flowering phenotype with wild type. in short-day  condition, transgenic arabidopsis plants with gmgbp <dig> flowered later and showed a higher level of flowering locus c compared with wild type. when treated with abiotic stresses, transgenic arabidopsis with the ectopic overexpression of gmgbp <dig> enhanced the tolerances to heat and drought stresses but reduced the tolerance to high salinity, and affected the expressions of several stress-related genes.


CONCLUSIONS
in arabidopsis, gmgbp <dig> might positively regulate the flowering time by affecting constans, flowering locus t, leafy and gamyb directly or indirectly in photoperiodic and gibberellin pathways in lds, but gmgbp <dig> might represse flowering by affecting flowering locus c and short vegetative phase in autonomous pathway in sds. gmgbp <dig> might regulate the activity of ros-eliminating to improve the resistance to heat and drought but reduce the high-salinity tolerance.
