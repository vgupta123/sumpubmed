BACKGROUND
members of the genus rhodococcus are frequently found in soil and other natural environments and are highly resistant to stresses common in those environments. the accumulation of storage compounds permits cells to survive and metabolically adapt during fluctuating environmental conditions. the purpose of this study was to perform a genome-wide bioinformatic analysis of key genes encoding metabolism of diverse storage compounds by rhodococcus jostii rha <dig> and to examine its ability to synthesize and accumulate triacylglycerols , wax esters, polyhydroxyalkanoates , glycogen and polyphosphate .


RESULTS
we identified in the rha <dig> genome:  <dig> genes encoding putative wax ester synthase/acyl-coa:diacylglycerol acyltransferase enzymes  likely involved in tag and wax esters biosynthesis; a total of  <dig> genes coding for putative lipase/esterase enzymes possibly involved in tag and wax ester degradation;  <dig> sets of genes encoding pha synthases and pha depolymerases;  <dig> genes encoding key enzymes for glycogen metabolism, one gene coding for a putative polyphosphate kinase and  <dig> putative exopolyphosphatase genes. where possible, key amino acid residues in the above proteins  were identified in order to support gene identification. rha <dig> cells grown under n-limiting conditions, accumulated tag as the main storage compounds plus wax esters, pha , glycogen and polyp. rhodococcus members were previously known to accumulate tag, wax esters, phas and polyp, but this is the first report of glycogen accumulation in this genus.


CONCLUSIONS
rha <dig> possess key genes to accumulate diverse storage compounds. under nitrogen-limiting conditions lipids are the principal storage compounds. an extensive capacity to synthesize and metabolize storage compounds appears to contribute versatility to rha <dig> in its responses to environmental stresses.
