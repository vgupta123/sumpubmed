BACKGROUND
the starting material for rna sequencing  studies is usually total rna or polya+ rna. both forms of rna represent heterogeneous pools of rna molecules at different levels of maturation and processing. such heterogeneity, in addition to the biases associated with polya+ purification steps, may influence the analysis, sensitivity and the interpretation of rna-seq data. we hypothesize that subcellular fractions of rna may provide a more accurate picture of gene expression.


RESULTS
we present results for sequencing of cytoplasmic and nuclear rna after cellular fractionation of tissue samples. in comparison with conventional polya+ rna, the cytoplasmic rna contains a significantly higher fraction of exonic sequence, providing increased sensitivity in expression analysis and splice junction detection, and in improved de novo assembly of rna-seq data. conversely, the nuclear fraction shows an enrichment of unprocessed rna compared with total rna-seq, making it suitable for analysis of nascent transcripts and rna processing dynamics.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that cellular fractionation is a more rapid and cost effective approach than conventional polya+ enrichment when studying mature rnas. thus, rna-seq of separated cytosolic and nuclear rna can significantly improve the analysis of complex transcriptomes from mammalian tissues.
