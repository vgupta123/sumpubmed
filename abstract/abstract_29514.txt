BACKGROUND
the arabidopsis var <dig> mutant displays a unique green and white/yellow leaf variegation phenotype and lacks var <dig>  a chloroplast ftsh metalloprotease. we are characterizing second-site var <dig> genetic suppressors as means to better understand var <dig> function and to study the regulation of chloroplast biogenesis.


RESULTS
in this report, we show that the suppression of var <dig> variegation in suppressor line tag- <dig> is due to the disruption of the suppressor of variegation <dig>  gene, encoding a putative typa-like translation elongation factor. svr <dig> is targeted to the chloroplast and svr <dig> single mutants have uniformly pale green leaves at 22Â°c. consistent with this phenotype, most chloroplast proteins and rrna species in svr <dig> have close to normal accumulation profiles, with the notable exception of the photosystem ii reaction center d <dig> protein, which is present at greatly reduced levels. when svr <dig> is challenged with chilling temperature , it develops a pronounced chlorosis that is accompanied by abnormal chloroplast rrna processing and chloroplast protein accumulation. double mutant analysis indicates a possible synergistic interaction between svr <dig> and svr <dig>  which is defective in a chloroplast pentatricopeptide repeat  protein.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings, on one hand, reinforce the strong genetic link between var <dig> and chloroplast translation, and on the other hand, point to a critical role of svr <dig>  and possibly some aspects of chloroplast translation, in the response of plants to chilling stress.
