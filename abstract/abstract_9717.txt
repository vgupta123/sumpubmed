BACKGROUND
polycomb group  proteins are a set of chromatin-modifying proteins that play a key role in epigenetic gene regulation. the pcg proteins form large multiprotein complexes with different activities. the two best-characterized pcg complexes are the pcg repressive complex  <dig>  and  <dig>  that respectively possess histone 2a lysine  <dig> e <dig> ubiquitin ligase and histone  <dig> lysine  <dig> methyltransferase activities. while prc2-like complexes are conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdoms, prc1-like complexes have only been described in drosophila and vertebrates. since both complexes are required for the gene silencing mechanism in drosophila and vertebrates, how prc <dig> function is realized in organisms that apparently lack prc <dig> such as plants, is so far unknown. in vertebrates, prc <dig> includes three proteins, ring1b, ring1a, and bmi- <dig> that form an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase complex. these prc <dig> proteins have an n-terminally located ring finger domain associated to a poorly characterized conserved c-terminal region.


RESULTS
we obtained statistically significant evidences of sequence similarity between the c-terminal region of the prc <dig> ring finger proteins and the ubiquitin -like family proteins, thus defining a new ubq-like domain, the rawul domain. in addition, our analysis revealed the existence of plant and worm proteins that display the conserved combination of a ring finger domain at the n-terminus and a rawul domain at the c-terminus.


CONCLUSIONS
analysis of the conserved domain architecture among prc <dig> ring finger proteins revealed the existence of long sought prc <dig> protein orthologs in these organisms, suggesting the functional conservation of prc <dig> throughout higher eukaryotes.
