BACKGROUND
leaf red coloration is an important characteristic in many plant species, including cultivars of ornamental peach . peach leaf color is controlled by a single gr gene on linkage group  <dig>  with a red allele dominant over the green allele. here, we report the identification of a candidate gene of gr in peach.


RESULTS
the red coloration of peach leaves is due to accumulation of anthocyanin pigments, which is regulated at the transcriptional level. based on transcriptome comparison between red- and green-colored leaves, an myb transcription regulator ppmyb <dig>  in the gr interval was identified to regulate anthocyanin pigmentation in peach leaf. transient expression of ppmyb <dig>  in tobacco and peach leaves can induce anthocyain accumulation. moreover, a functional myb gene ppmyb <dig>  on linkage group  <dig>  which is homologous to ppmyb <dig> , is also expressed in both red- and green-colored leaves, but plays no role in leaf red coloration. this suggests a complex mechanism underlying anthocyanin accumulation in peach leaf. in addition, ppmyb <dig>  and other anthocyanin-activating myb genes in rosaceae responsible for anthocyanin accumulation in fruit are dated to a common ancestor about  <dig> million years ago . however, ppmyb <dig>  has diverged from these anthocyanin-activating mybs to generate a new gene family, which regulates anthocyanin accumulation in vegetative organs such as leaves.


CONCLUSIONS
activation of an ancient duplicated myb gene ppmyb <dig>  in the gr interval on lg  <dig>  which represents a novel branch of anthocyanin-activating myb genes in rosaceae, is able to activate leaf red coloration in peach.
