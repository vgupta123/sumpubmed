BACKGROUND
flower phylogenetics and genetically controlled development have been revolutionised during the last two decades. however, some of these evolutionary aspects are still debatable. mads-box genes are known to play essential role in specifying the floral organogenesis and differentiation in numerous model plants like petunia hybrida, arabidopsis thaliana and antirrhinum majus. sepallata  genes, belonging to the mads-box gene family, are members of the abcde and quartet models of floral organ development and play a vital role in flower development. however, few studies of the genes in prunus mume have yet been conducted.


RESULTS
in this study, we cloned four pmseps and investigated their phylogenetic relationship with other species. expression pattern analyses and yeast two-hybrid assays of these four genes indicated their involvement in the floral organogenesis with pmsep <dig> specifically related to specification of the prolificated flowers in p. mume. it was observed that the flower meristem was specified by pmsep <dig> and pmsep <dig>  the sepal by pmsep <dig> and pmsep <dig>  petals by pmsep <dig> and pmsep <dig>  stamens by pmsep <dig> and pmsep <dig> and pistils by pmsep <dig> and pmsep <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
with the above in mind, flower development in p. mume might be due to an expression of sep genes. our findings can provide a foundation for further investigations of the transcriptional factors governing flower development, their molecular mechanisms and genetic basis.
