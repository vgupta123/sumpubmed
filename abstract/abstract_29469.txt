BACKGROUND
currently established methods to identify viable and non-viable cells of cyanobacteria are either time-consuming  or preparation-intensive . in this paper we present a new and fast viability assay for unicellular cyanobacteria, which uses red chlorophyll fluorescence and an unspecific green autofluorescence for the differentiation of viable and non-viable cells without the need of sample preparation.


RESULTS
the viability assay for unicellular cyanobacteria using red and green autofluorescence was established and validated for the model organism synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  both autofluorescence signals could be observed simultaneously allowing a direct classification of viable and non-viable cells. the results were confirmed by plating/colony count, absorption spectra and chlorophyll measurements. the use of an automated fluorescence microscope and a novel imagej based image analysis plugin allow a semi-automated analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
the new method simplifies the process of viability analysis and allows a quick and accurate analysis. furthermore results indicate that a combination of the new assay with absorption spectra or chlorophyll concentration measurements allows the estimation of the vitality of cells.
