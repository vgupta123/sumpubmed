BACKGROUND
rice cebip recognizes chitin oligosaccharides on the fungal cell surface or released into the plant apoplast, leading to the expression of plant disease resistance against fungal infection. however, it has not yet been reported whether cebip is actually required for restricting the growth of fungal pathogens. here we evaluated the involvement of a putative chitin receptor gene in the basal resistance of barley to the ssd <dig> mutant of magnaporthe oryzae, which induces multiple host defense responses.


RESULTS
the mossd <dig> mutant showed attenuated pathogenicity on barley and appressorial penetration was restricted by the formation of callose papillae at attempted entry sites. when conidial suspensions of mossd <dig> mutant were spotted onto the leaves of hvcebip-silenced plants, small brown necrotic flecks or blast lesions were produced but these lesions did not expand beyond the inoculation site. wild-type m. oryzae also produced slightly more severe symptoms on the leaves of hvcebip-silenced plants. cytological observation revealed that these lesions resulted from appressorium-mediated penetration into plant epidermal cells.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that hvcebip is involved in basal resistance against appressorium-mediated infection and that basal resistance might be triggered by the recognition of chitin oligosaccharides derived from m. oryzae.
