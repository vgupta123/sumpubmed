BACKGROUND
arabidopsis thaliana transthyretin-like  protein is a potential substrate in the brassinosteroid signalling cascade, having a role that moderates plant growth. moreover, sequence homology revealed two sequence domains similar to 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline  decarboxylase  and 5-hydroxyisourate  hydrolase . ttl is a member of the transthyretin-related protein family , which comprises a number of proteins with sequence homology to transthyretin  and the characteristic c-terminal sequence motif tyr-arg-gly-ser. trps are single domain proteins that form tetrameric structures with 5-hiu hydrolase activity. experimental evidence is fundamental for knowing if ttl is a tetrameric protein, formed by the association of the 5-hiu hydrolase domains and, in this case, if the structural arrangement allows for ohcu decarboxylase activity. this work reports about the biochemical and functional characterization of ttl.


RESULTS
the ttl gene was cloned and the protein expressed and purified for biochemical and functional characterization. the results show that ttl is composed of four subunits, with a moderately elongated shape. we also found evidence for 5-hiu hydrolase and ohcu decarboxylase activities in vitro, in the full-length protein.


CONCLUSIONS
the arabidopsis thaliana transthyretin-like  protein is a tetrameric bifunctional enzyme, since it has 5-hiu hydrolase and ohcu decarboxylase activities, which were simultaneously observed in vitro.
