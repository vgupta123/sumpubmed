BACKGROUND
bioinformatics data analysis toolbox needs general-purpose, fast and easily interpretable preprocessing tools that perform data integration during exploratory data analysis. our focus is on vector-valued data sources, each consisting of measurements of the same entity but on different variables, and on tasks where source-specific variation is considered noisy or not interesting. principal components analysis of all sources combined together is an obvious choice if it is not important to distinguish between data source-specific and shared variation. canonical correlation analysis  focuses on mutual dependencies and discards source-specific "noise" but it produces a separate set of components for each source.


RESULTS
it turns out that components given by cca can be combined easily to produce a linear and hence fast and easily interpretable feature extraction method. the method fuses together several sources, such that the properties they share are preserved. source-specific variation is discarded as uninteresting. we give the details and implement them in a software tool. the method is demonstrated on gene expression measurements in three case studies: classification of cell cycle regulated genes in yeast, identification of differentially expressed genes in leukemia, and defining stress response in yeast. the software package is available at .


CONCLUSIONS
we introduced a method for the task of data fusion for exploratory data analysis, when statistical dependencies between the sources and not within a source are interesting. the method uses canonical correlation analysis in a new way for dimensionality reduction, and inherits its good properties of being simple, fast, and easily interpretable as a linear projection.
