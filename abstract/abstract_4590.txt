BACKGROUND
during apoptosis cells become profoundly restructured through concerted cleavage of cellular proteins by caspases. in epithelial tissues, apoptotic cells loose their apical/basal polarity and are extruded from the epithelium. we used the drosophila embryo as a system to investigate the regulation of components of the zonula adherens during apoptosis. since armadillo/beta-catenin  is a major regulator of cadherin-mediated adhesion, we analyzed the mechanisms of arm proteolysis in apoptosis.


RESULTS
we define early and late apoptotic stages and find that early in apoptosis dÎ±-catenin remains relatively stable, while arm and de-cadherin protein levels are strongly reduced. arm is cleaved by caspases in embryo extracts and we provide evidence that the caspase- <dig> homolog drice cleaves arm in vitro and in vivo. cleavage by drice creates a stable protein fragment that remains associated with the plasma membrane early in apoptosis. to further understand the role of caspase-mediated cleavage of arm, we examined potential caspase cleavage sites and found that drice cleaves arm at a unique dqvd motif in the n-terminal domain of the protein. mutation of the drice cleavage site in arm results in a protein that is not cleaved in vitro and in vivo. furthermore we provide evidence that cleavage of arm plays a role in the removal of de-cadherin from the plasma membrane during apoptosis.


CONCLUSIONS
this study defines the specificity of caspase cleavage of arm in drosophila apoptotic cells. our data suggest that n-terminal truncation of arm by caspases is evolutionarily conserved and thus might provide a principal mechanism involved in the disassembly of adherens junctions during apoptosis.
