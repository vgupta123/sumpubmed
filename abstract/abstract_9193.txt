BACKGROUND
although several chloroplast rna splicing and ribosome maturation  domain-containing proteins have been characterized for intron splicing and rrna processing during chloroplast gene expression, the functional role of a majority of crm domain proteins in plant growth and development as well as chloroplast rna metabolism remains largely unknown. here, we characterized the developmental and stress response roles of a nuclear-encoded chloroplast protein harboring a single crm domain , designated cfm <dig>  in arabidopsis thaliana.


RESULTS
analysis of cfm4-gfp fusion proteins revealed that cfm <dig> is localized to chloroplasts. the loss-of-function t-dna insertion mutants for cfm <dig>  displayed retarded growth and delayed senescence, suggesting that cfm <dig> plays a role in growth and development of plants under normal growth conditions. in addition, cfm <dig> mutants showed retarded seed germination and seedling growth under stress conditions. no alteration in the splicing patterns of intron-containing chloroplast genes was observed in the mutant plants, but the processing of 16s and  <dig> s rrnas was abnormal in the mutant plants. importantly, cfm <dig> was determined to possess rna chaperone activity.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that the chloroplast-targeted cfm <dig>  one of two arabidopsis genes encoding a single crm domain-containing protein, harbors rna chaperone activity and plays a role in the arabidopsis growth and stress response by affecting rrna processing in chloroplasts.
