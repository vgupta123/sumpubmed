BACKGROUND
accidental autoclaving of l-glutamine was found to facilitate the agrobacterium infection of a non host plant like tea in an earlier study. in the present communication, we elucidate the structural changes in l-glutamine due to autoclaving and also confirm the role of heat transformed l-glutamine in agrobacterium mediated genetic transformation of host/non host plants.


RESULTS
when autoclaved at 121°c and  <dig> psi for  <dig> or  <dig> min, l-glutamine was structurally modified into 5-oxo proline and 3-amino glutarimide , respectively. of the two autoclaved products, only α-amino glutarimide facilitated agrobacterium infection of a number of resistant to susceptible plants. however, the compound did not have any vir gene inducing property.


CONCLUSIONS
we report a one pot autoclave process for the synthesis of 5-oxo proline and α-amino glutarimide from l-glutamine. xenobiotic detoxifying property of α-amino glutarimide is also proposed.
