BACKGROUND
polyploid species contribute to oryza diversity. however, the mechanisms underlying gene and genome evolution in oryza polyploids remain largely unknown. the allotetraploid oryza minuta, which is estimated to have formed less than one million years ago, along with its putative diploid progenitors , are quite suitable for the study of polyploid genome evolution using a comparative genomics approach.


RESULTS
here, we performed a comparative study of a large genomic region surrounding the shattering <dig> locus in o. minuta, as well as in o. punctata and o. officinalis. duplicated genomes in o. minuta have maintained the diploid genome organization, except for several structural variations mediated by transposon movement. tandem duplicated gene clusters are prevalent in the sh <dig> region, and segmental duplication followed by random deletion is illustrated to explain the gene gain-and-loss process. both copies of most duplicated genes still persist in o. minuta. molecular evolution analysis suggested that these duplicated genes are equally evolved and mostly manipulated by purifying selection. however, cdna-sscp analysis revealed that the expression patterns were dramatically altered between duplicated genes: nine of  <dig> duplicated genes exhibited expression divergence in o. minuta. we further detected one gene silencing event that was attributed to gene structural variation, but most gene silencing could not be related to sequence changes. we identified one case in which dna methylation differences within promoter regions that were associated with the insertion of one hat element were probably responsible for gene silencing, suggesting a potential epigenetic gene silencing pathway triggered by te movement.


CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involved in duplicated gene silencing in the allotetraploid o. minuta.
