BACKGROUND
while an increase in bone marrow adiposity is associated with age-related bone disease, the function of bone marrow adipocytes has not been studied. the aim of this study was to characterize and compare the age-related gene expression profiles in bone marrow adipocytes and epididymal adipocytes.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed in bone marrow adipocytes compared to epididymal adipocytes. bone marrow adipocytes revealed a distinct gene profile with low expression of adipocyte-specific genes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma , fatty acid binding protein  <dig> , perilipin , adipsin  and high expression of genes associated with early adipocyte differentiation , regulator of g-protein signaling  <dig> . in addition, a number of genes including secreted frizzled related protein  <dig> , tumor necrosis factor Î± , transforming growth factor beta  <dig>  g-protein coupled receptor 109a  and interleukin  <dig> , that could affect adipose-derived signaling to bone are markedly increased in bone marrow adipocytes. age had a substantial effect on genes associated with mitochondria function and inflammation in bone marrow adipocytes. twenty seven genes were significantly changed with age in both adipocyte depots. among these genes, il <dig> and gpr109a were significantly reduced with age in both adipocyte depots.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, gene profiling reveals a unique phenotype for primary bone marrow adipocytes characterized by low adipose-specific gene expression and high expression of inflammatory response genes. bone marrow and epididymal adipocytes share a common pathway in response to aging in mice, but age has a greater impact on global gene expression in epididymal than in bone marrow adipocytes. genes that are differentially expressed at greater levels in the bone marrow are highly regulated with age.
