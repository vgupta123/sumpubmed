BACKGROUND
resistance of soybean  cultivars to populations of cyst nematode  was complicated by the diversity of hg types , the multigenic nature of resistance and the temperature dependence of resistance to biotypes. the objective here was to identify qtl for broad-spectrum resistance to scn and examine the transcript abundances of some genes within the qtl.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> f <dig> derived f <dig> recombinant inbred lines  were advanced by single-seed-descent from a cross between 'l-10'  and 'heinong 37' . associated qtl were identified by winqtl <dig> . qtl qscn3- <dig> on linkage group  e, qscn3- <dig> on lg g, qscn3- <dig> on lg j and qscn14- <dig> on lg o were associated with scn resistance in both year data . qscn14- <dig> on lg o was identified to be associated with scn resistance in  <dig>  qscn14- <dig> on lg d <dig> was identified to be associated with scn resistance in  <dig>  qscn14- <dig> on lg j was identified to be associated with scn resistance in  <dig>  the qscn3- <dig> on lg g was linked to satt <dig> , and explained  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation in  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. qscn3- <dig> was less than  <dig> cm from satt <dig> on lg j, and explained  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variations in  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. qscn14- <dig> could explain  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation for the scn race  <dig> resistance in  <dig> and was located in the same region as qscn3- <dig>  the total phenotypic variation explained by qscn3- <dig> and qscn3- <dig> together was  <dig> % and  <dig> % in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. further, the flanking markers satt <dig>  satt <dig>  sat_ <dig> and satt <dig> were used for the selection of resistant lines to scn race  <dig>  and the accuracy of selection was about 73% in this ril population. four genes in the predicted resistance gene cluster of lg j  were successfully cloned by rt-pcr. the transcript encoded by the gene glyma16g <dig>  was abundant in the scn resistant cultivar 'l-10' but absent in susceptible cultivar 'heinong 37'. further, the abundance was higher in root than in leaf for 'l-10'. therefore, the gene was a strong candidate to underlie part of the resistance to scn.


CONCLUSIONS
satt <dig>  satt <dig>  sat_ <dig> and satt <dig>  which were tightly linked to the major qtl for resistance to scn on lg g and j, would be candidates for marker-assisted selection of lines resistant to the scn race  <dig>  among the six rlk genes, glyma16g <dig>  was found to accumulate transcripts in the scn resistance cultivar 'l-10' but not in 'heinong 37'. the transcript abundance was higher in root than in leaf for l- <dig>
