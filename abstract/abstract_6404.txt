BACKGROUND
triacylglycerides  are a class of neutral lipids that represent the most important storage form of energy for eukaryotic cells. dgat  is a transmembrane enzyme that acts in the final and committed step of tag synthesis, and it has been proposed to be the rate-limiting enzyme in plant storage lipid accumulation. in fact, two different enzymes identified in several eukaryotic species, dgat <dig> and dgat <dig>  are the main enzymes responsible for tag synthesis. these enzymes do not share high dna or protein sequence similarities, and it has been suggested that they play non-redundant roles in different tissues and in some species in tag synthesis. despite a number of previous studies on the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> genes, which have emphasized their importance as potential obesity treatment targets to increase triacylglycerol accumulation, little is known about their evolutionary timeline in eukaryotes. the goal of this study was to examine the evolutionary relationship of the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> genes across eukaryotic organisms in order to infer their origin.


RESULTS
we have conducted a broad survey of fully sequenced genomes, including representatives of amoebozoa, yeasts, fungi, algae, musses, plants, vertebrate and invertebrate species, for the presence of dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> gene homologs. we found that the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> genes are nearly ubiquitous in eukaryotes and are readily identifiable in all the major eukaryotic groups and genomes examined. phylogenetic analyses of the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> amino acid sequences revealed evolutionary partitioning of the dgat protein family into two major dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> clades. protein secondary structure and hydrophobic-transmembrane analysis also showed differences between these enzymes. the analysis also revealed that the mgat <dig> and awat genes may have arisen from dgat <dig> duplication events.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified several dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> homologs in eukaryote taxa. overall, the data show that dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> are present in most eukaryotic organisms and belong to two different gene families. the phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses revealed that dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> evolved separately, with functional convergence, despite their wide molecular and structural divergence.
