BACKGROUND
p <dig> is a key tumor suppressor protein. in response to dna damage, p <dig> accumulates to high levels in differentiated cells and activates target genes that initiate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. since stem cells provide the proliferative cell pool within organisms, an efficient dna damage response is crucial.


RESULTS
in proliferating embryonic stem cells, p <dig> is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. dna damage-induced nuclear accumulation of p <dig> in embryonic stem cells activates transcription of the target genes mdm <dig>  p <dig>  puma and noxa. we observed bi-phasic kinetics for nuclear accumulation of p <dig> after ionizing radiation. during the first wave of nuclear accumulation, p <dig> levels were increased and the p <dig> target genes mdm <dig>  p <dig> and puma were transcribed. transcription of noxa correlated with the second wave of nuclear accumulation. transcriptional activation of p <dig> target genes resulted in an increased amount of proteins with the exception of p <dig>  while p <dig> transcripts were efficiently translated in 3t <dig> cells, we failed to see an increase in p <dig> protein levels after ir in embryonal stem cells.


CONCLUSIONS
in embryonic stem cells where  p <dig> activity is not necessary, or even unfavorable, p <dig> is retained in the cytoplasm and prevented from activating its target genes. however, if its activity is beneficial or required, p <dig> is allowed to accumulate in the nucleus and activates its target genes, even in embryonic stem cells.
