BACKGROUND
mast cell -derived serine proteases have been implicated in a variety of inflammatory processes. we have previously shown that rat peritoneal mc  express mrna for protease activated receptor  <dig> , a g-coupled receptor activated by trypsin-like proteases. recent evidence also suggests that mc-induced inflammation can be mediated through par. therefore, we hypothesized that specific par- <dig> agonist peptides  induce protease release from pmc.


RESULTS
western blot analysis of pmc supernatants revealed that a par-2ap, tc-ligrlo , stimulated the release of rat mc protease - <dig>  rmcp- <dig> and carboxypeptidase-a. the release was evident by  <dig> min but further increased up to  <dig> h. to study the biological effects of protease release we tested supernatants from tc-ligrlo, tc-olrgil  and antigen-activated pmc for proteolytic activity by seeding with tnf , incubating for  <dig> h at 37Â°c, and measuring tnf remaining in the supernatants. supernatants from tc-ligrlo-stimulated pmc degraded  <dig> % of seeded tnf . moreover, this tnf proteolysis was dependent on the concentration of tc-ligrlo used to stimulate pmc, and was significantly inhibited  by soybean trypsin inhibitor. antigen and tc-olrgil induced no significant release of such proteolytic activity.


CONCLUSIONS
these data indicate that a par-2ap induces the release of proteases from mast cells, which may degrade extracellular cytokines and other substrates thus modulating the inflammatory response.
