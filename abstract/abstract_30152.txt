BACKGROUND
mapping of dnase i hypersensitive sites  is a powerful tool to experimentally identify cis-regulatory elements . among cres, enhancers are abundant and predominantly act in driving cell-specific gene expression. krüppel-like factors  are a family of eukaryotic transcription factors. several klfs have been demonstrated to play important roles in hematopoiesis. however, transcriptional regulation of klfs via cres, particularly enhancers, in erythroid cells has been poorly understood.


RESULTS
in this study,  <dig> erythroid-specific or putative erythroid-specific dhss were identified by dnase-seq in the genomic regions of  <dig> human klfs, and their enhancer activities were evaluated using dual-luciferase reporter  assay. of the  <dig> erythroid-specific dhss, the enhancer activities of  <dig> dhss were comparable to that of the classical enhancer hs <dig> in driving minimal promoter . fifteen dhss, some overlapping those that increased minp activities, acted as enhancers when driving the corresponding klf promoters  in erythroid cells; of these,  <dig> dhss were finally characterized as erythroid-specific klf enhancers. these  <dig> erythroid-specific klf enhancers were further confirmed using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to sequencing  data-based bioinformatic and biochemical analyses.


CONCLUSIONS
our present findings provide a feasible strategy to extensively identify gene- and cell-specific enhancers from dhss obtained by high-throughput sequencing, which will help reveal the transcriptional regulation and biological functions of genes in some specific cells.
