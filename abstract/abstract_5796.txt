BACKGROUND
bacterial penicillin-binding proteins and β-lactamases  constitute a large family of serine proteases that perform essential functions in the synthesis and maintenance of peptidoglycan. intriguingly, genes encoding pbp-βl homologs occur in many metazoan genomes including humans. the emerging role of lactb, a mammalian mitochondrial pbp-βl homolog, in metabolic signaling prompted us to investigate the evolutionary history of metazoan pbp-βl proteins.


RESULTS
metazoan pbp-βl homologs including lactb share unique structural features with bacterial class b low molecular weight penicillin-binding proteins. the amino acid residues necessary for enzymatic activity in bacterial pbp-βl proteins, including the catalytic serine residue, are conserved in all metazoan homologs. phylogenetic analysis indicated that metazoan pbp-βl homologs comprise four alloparalogus protein lineages that derive from α-proteobacteria.


CONCLUSIONS
while most components of the peptidoglycan synthesis machinery were dumped by early eukaryotes, a few pbp-βl proteins were conserved and are found in metazoans including humans. metazoan pbp-βl homologs are active-site-serine enzymes that probably have distinct functions in the metabolic circuitry. we hypothesize that pbp-βl proteins in the early eukaryotic cell enabled the degradation of peptidoglycan from ingested bacteria, thereby maximizing the yield of nutrients and streamlining the cell for effective phagocytotic feeding.
