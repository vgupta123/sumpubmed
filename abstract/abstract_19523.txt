BACKGROUND
this paper examines the use of bulk milk antibody , youngstock  serology  and bulk milk pcr  for determining the presence or absence of animals persistently infected  with bovine viral diarrhoea virus  within a herd. data is presented from  <dig> herds where average herd sizes were  <dig> and  <dig> animals for dairy and beef units respectively. seventeen herds had sufficient data to analyse using receiver operating characteristic  and probability curves enabling calculation of the sensitivity and specificity of bm ab and ys check tests for determining the presence of pi animals within herds in this dataset.


RESULTS
using bm ab to screen a herd for the presence of pi animals, achieved a herd level sensitivity and specificity of  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  respectively . sensitivity and specificity of ys check tests at a cut off of 3/ <dig> ab positive ys were  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  respectively . these results were achieved by comparing the screening tests to whole herd pi searches that took place 1– <dig> months after the initial screen with a mean interval of 8 months. removal of this delay by taking bm samples on the day of a whole herd test and simulating a ys check test from the herd test data produced improvements in the reliability of the check tests. bm ab sensitivity and specificity remained unchanged. however, the check test sensitivity and specificity improved to  <dig>  %  and 100 %  respectively  at a cut of off  <dig> / <dig> ab positive animals. our limited bm pcr results identified 5/ <dig> dairy farms with a positive bm pcr result; two contained milking pis, two had non-milking pis and another had no pis identified.


CONCLUSIONS
delaying a pi search following an initial herd screen decreased the diagnostic accuracy and relevance of our results. with careful interpretation, longitudinal surveillance using a combination of the techniques discussed can successfully determine farm status and therefore allow changes in bvdv status to be detected early, thus enabling prompt action in the event of a bvdv incursion.
