BACKGROUND
plant growth is greatly affected by low temperatures, and the expression of a number of genes is induced by cold stress. although many genes in the cold signaling pathway have been identified in arabidopsis, little is known about the transcription factors involved in the cold stress response in apple.


RESULTS
here, we show that the apple bhlh  gene mdcibhlh <dig> , which encodes an ice-like protein, was noticeably induced in response to cold stress. the mdcibhlh <dig> protein specifically bound to the myc recognition sequences in the atcbf <dig> promoter, and mdcibhlh <dig> overexpression enhanced cold tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis. in addition, the mdcibhlh <dig> protein bound to the promoters of mdcbf <dig> and favorably contributed to cold tolerance in transgenic apple plants by upregulating the expression of mdcbf <dig> through the cbf  pathway. our findings indicate that mdcibhlh <dig> functions in stress tolerance in different species. for example, ectopic mdcibhlh <dig> expression conferred enhanced chilling tolerance in transgenic tobacco. finally, we observed that cold induces the degradation of the mdcibhlh <dig> protein in apple and that this degradation was potentially mediated by ubiquitination and sumoylation.


CONCLUSIONS
based on these findings, mdcibhlh <dig> encodes a transcription factor that is important for the cold tolerance response in apple.
