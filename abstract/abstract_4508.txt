BACKGROUND
genome-wide association studies  have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms  associated with diseases of the colon including inflammatory bowel diseases  and colorectal cancer . however, the functional role of many of these snps is largely unknown and tissue-specific resources are lacking. expression quantitative trait loci  mapping identifies target genes of disease-associated snps. this study provides a comprehensive eqtl map of distal colonic samples obtained from  <dig> healthy african americans and demonstrates their relevance for gwas of colonic diseases.


RESULTS
 <dig>  million imputed snps were tested for their associations with  <dig>  expression probes representing  <dig>  unique genes.  <dig>  significant cis-eqtl, corresponding to  <dig> independent signals, were identified at a false discovery rate  of  <dig> . overall, among colon cis-eqtl, there was significant enrichment for gwas variants for ibd  and crc as well as type  <dig> diabetes and body mass index. erap <dig>  adcy <dig>  inpp5e, uba <dig>  sfmbt <dig>  nxpe <dig> and rexo <dig> were identified as target genes for ibd-associated variants. the crc-associated eqtl rs <dig> was associated with the expression of c11orf <dig> . enrichment of colon eqtl near transcription start sites and for active histone marks was demonstrated, and eqtl with high population differentiation were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
through the comprehensive study of eqtl in the human colon, this study identified novel target genes for ibd- and crc-associated genetic variants. moreover, bioinformatic characterization of colon eqtl provides a tissue-specific tool to improve understanding of biological differences in diseases between different ethnic groups.
