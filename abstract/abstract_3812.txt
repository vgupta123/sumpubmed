BACKGROUND
histone lysine methylation has a pivotal role in regulating the chromatin. histone modifiers, including histone methyl transferases , have clear roles in human carcinogenesis but the extent of their functions and regulation are not well understood. the nsd family of hmtases comprised of three members  are oncogenes aberrantly expressed in several cancers, suggesting their potential to serve as novel therapeutic targets. however, the substrate specificity of the nsds and the molecular mechanism of histones h <dig> and h <dig> recognition and methylation have not yet been established.


RESULTS
herein, we investigated the in vitro mechanisms of histones h <dig> and h <dig> recognition and modifications by the catalytic domain of nsd family members. in this study, we quantified in vitro mono-, di- and tri- methylations on h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h4k <dig> by the carboxyl terminal domain  of nsd <dig>  nsd <dig> and nsd <dig>  using histone as substrate. next, we used a molecular modelling approach and docked 6-mer peptides h3k <dig> a.a. 1-7; h3k <dig> a.a. 5-11; h3k <dig> a.a. 23-29; h3k <dig> a.a. 32-38; h3k <dig> a.a. 75-81; h4k <dig> a.a. 16- <dig> with the catalytic domain of the nsds to provide insight into lysine-marks recognition and methylation on histones h <dig> and h <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our data highlight the versatility of nsd <dig>  nsd <dig>  and nsd <dig> for recognizing and methylating several histone lysine marks on histones h <dig> and h <dig>  our work provides a basis to design selective and specific nsds inhibitors. we discuss the relevance of our findings for the development of nsd inhibitors amenable for novel chemotherapies.
