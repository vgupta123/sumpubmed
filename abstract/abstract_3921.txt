BACKGROUND
korean ginseng  is a highly effective medicinal plant containing ginsenosides with various pharmacological activities, whose roots are produced commercially for crude drugs.


RESULTS
here, we used the illumina platform to generate over  <dig> million rna sequencing reads from four root samples, including whole roots from one-year-old plants and three types of root tissue from six-year-old plants . through de novo assembly and reference-assisted selection, we obtained a non-redundant unigene set consisting of  <dig>  transcripts with an average length of  <dig>  bp. among transcripts in the unigene set,  <dig> % were functionally annotated via similarity searches against protein databases. approximately  <dig>  % of the transcripts represent novel gene sequences that have not previously been reported for p. ginseng. digital expression profiling revealed  <dig> genes showing differential expression patterns among the four root samples. additionally,  <dig> were uniquely expressed in one-year-old roots, while seven were uniquely expressed in six-year-old root tissues. we identified  <dig> transcripts encoding enzymes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis pathways and  <dig> encoding udp-glycosyltransferases.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis provides new insights into the role of the root transcriptome in development and secondary metabolite biosynthesis in p. ginseng.
