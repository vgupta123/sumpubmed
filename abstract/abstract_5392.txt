BACKGROUND
the pseudomonas aeruginosa major constitutive outer membrane porin protein f  has been shown to be a protective antigen and was previously used to activate an immunological response in a mouse model of lung pneumonia. the purpose of our study was to demonstrate the ability of mouse dendritic cells pulsed with purified or recombinant oprf to protect mice against p. aeruginosa infection and inflammation.

both native , isolated and purified from pao <dig> bacterial strain, and recombinant  oprf , obtained by cloning of the oprf gene into the pet28a expression vector, were used to stimulate dendritic cells in vitro before adoptive transfer into prospective recipient mice with p. aeruginosa pulmonary infection.


RESULTS
similar to n-oprf, his-oprf activated dendritic cells in vitro, inducing the costimulatory molecule expression as well as cytokine production. upon adoptive transfer in vivo, porin-pulsed dendritic cells  induced th1-mediated resistance to infection and associated inflammatory pathology caused by either the pao <dig> strain or a clinically-isolated mucoid strain.


CONCLUSIONS
this study highlights the pivotal contribution of dcs to vaccine-induced protection against p. aeruginosa infection and associated inflammation.
