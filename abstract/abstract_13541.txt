BACKGROUND
cabbage fusarium wilt is a major disease worldwide that can cause severe yield loss in cabbage . although markers linked to the resistance gene foc <dig> have been identified, no candidate gene for it has been determined so far. in this study, we report the fine mapping and analysis of a candidate gene for foc <dig> using a double haploid  population with  <dig> lines and a f <dig> population of  <dig> individuals derived from the same parental lines.


RESULTS
we confirmed that the resistance to fusarium wilt was controlled by a single dominant gene based on the resistance segregation ratio of the two populations. using indel primers designed from whole-genome re-sequencing data for the two parental lines  and the dh population, we mapped the resistance gene to a 382-kb genomic region on chromosome c <dig>  using the f <dig> population, we narrowed the region to an 84-kb interval that harbored ten genes, including four probable resistance genes : bol <dig>  bol <dig>  bol <dig> and bol <dig> according to the gene annotations from brad, the genomic database for b. oleracea. after correcting the model of the these genes, we re-predicted two r genes in the target region: re-bol <dig> and re-bol <dig>  the latter was excluded after we compared the two genes’ sequences between ten resistant materials and ten susceptible materials. for re-bol <dig>  we found high identity among the sequences of the resistant lines, while among the susceptible lines, there were two types of indels , each of which caused a frameshift and terminating mutation in the cdna sequences. further sequence analysis of the two indel loci from  <dig> lines  also showed that all  <dig> r lines had no indel mutation while  <dig> out of 40 s lines matched the two types of loci. thus re-bol <dig> was identified as a likely candidate gene for foc <dig> in cabbage.


CONCLUSIONS
this work may lay the foundation for marker-assisted selection as well as for further function analysis of the foc <dig> gene.
