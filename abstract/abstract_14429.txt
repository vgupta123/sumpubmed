BACKGROUND
serial analysis of gene expression  is a new technique that allows a detailed and profound quantitative and qualitative knowledge of gene expression profile, without previous knowledge of sequence of analyzed genes. we carried out a modification of sage methodology , useful for the analysis of limited quantities of tissue samples, on normal human cervical tissue obtained from a donor without histopathological lesions. cervical epithelium is constituted mainly by cervical keratinocytes which are the targets of human papilloma virus , where persistent hpv infection of cervical epithelium is associated with an increase risk for developing cervical carcinomas .


RESULTS
we report here a transcriptome analysis of cervical tissue by sage, derived from  <dig>  sequenced tags that provide a wealth of information about the gene products involved in normal cervical epithelium physiology, as well as genes not previously found in uterine cervix tissue involved in the process of epidermal differentiation.


CONCLUSIONS
this first comprehensive and profound analysis of uterine cervix transcriptome, should be useful for the identification of genes involved in normal cervix uterine function, and candidate genes associated with cervical carcinoma.
