BACKGROUND
the new world monkey  subfamily pitheciinae is represented by the genera pithecia, chiropotes and cacajao. in this work we studied the karyotypes of pithecia irrorata  and cacajao calvus rubicundus  by g- and c-banding, nor staining and chromosome painting using human and saguinus oedipus whole chromosome probes. the karyotypes of both species were compared with each other and with chiropotes utahicki  from the literature.


RESULTS
our results show that members of the pitheciinae have conserved several chromosome forms found in the inferred ancestral platyrrhini karyotype . further, the monophyly of this subfamily is supported by three chromosomal synapomorphies . in addition, each species presents several autapomorphies. from this data set we established a chromosomal phylogeny of pitheciinae, resulting in a single most parsimonious tree.


CONCLUSIONS
in our chromosomal phylogeny, the genus pithecia occurred in a more basal position close to the inferred ancestor of platyrrhini, while c. c. rubicundus and c. utahicki are closely related and are linked by exclusive synapomorphies.
