BACKGROUND
benzo pyrene  exposure induces dna adducts at all stages of spermatogenesis and in testis, and removal of these lesions is less efficient in nucleotide excision repair deficient xpc-/- mice than in wild type mice. in this study, we investigated by using microarray technology whether compromised dna repair in xpc-/- mice may lead to a transcriptional reaction of the testis to cope with increased levels of bp induced dna damage.


RESULTS
two-way anova revealed only  <dig> genes differentially expressed between wild type and xpc-/- mice, and  <dig> genes between testes of bp treated and untreated mice irrespective of the mouse genotype. however, the level in which these bp regulated genes are expressed differs between wt and xpc-/- mice , and were predominantly involved in the regulation of cell cycle, translation, chromatin structure and spermatogenesis, indicating a general stress response. in addition, analysis of cell cycle phase dependent gene expression revealed that expression of genes involved in g1-s and g2-m phase arrest was increased after bp exposure in both genotypes. a slightly higher induction of average gene expression was observed at the g2-m checkpoint in xpc-/- mice, but this did not reach statistical significance . other processes that were expected to have changed by exposure, like apoptosis and dna repair, were not found to be modulated at the level of gene expression.


CONCLUSIONS
gene expression in testis of untreated xpc-/- and wild type mice were very similar, with only  <dig> genes differentially expressed. exposure to benzopyrene affected the expression of genes that are involved in cell cycle regulation in both genotypes, indicating that the presence of unrepaired dna damage in testis blocks cell proliferation to protect dna integrity in both dna repair proficient and deficient animals.
