BACKGROUND
monkey 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  is a catabolic enzyme responsible for converting progesterone into biologically inactive 20α-hydroxyprogesterone, thereby playing a key role in the estrous cycle or pregnancy and allowing ovulation and parturition to occur in most mammalian animals. monkey 20α-hsd was highly abundant in ovarian and placental tissues during the pre-ovulation and pre-parturition phase and was primarily localized in the syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta. in this study, we focused on the molecular characterization of the monkey 20α-hsd promoter region by conducting reporter assays in chinese hamster ovary  k <dig> cells.


RESULTS
a reporter assay using constructs of various lengths of the 5′-flanking region  revealed that a region corresponding to the activator protein  <dig>  located between - <dig> and -274 bp was essential for the transcriptional activity. absence of the ap- <dig> site in -273-luc dramatically decreased the transcription levels to the control levels. when the reporter constructs were co-transfected with ap- <dig>  and specificity protein  genes, the transcription activities of the constructs increased with the exception of - <dig> and - <dig>  while that of the double construct was reduced compared to that of ap- <dig> alone. furthermore, mutational analysis demonstrated that a putative ap- <dig> site played an important role in the expression of the reporter gene. these findings were confirmed by emsa examining the interactions of the protein ap- <dig> in a nuclear extract from cho-k <dig> cells and the expression levels of the ap- <dig> transcription factor in pre-parturition placenta and cho-k <dig> cells. although mut- <dig> and mut- <dig> of ap- <dig> bound with nuclear extracts from cho-k <dig> cells, the transcriptional activity of mut- <dig> was almost completely suppressed.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the ap- <dig> site   plays a crucial role in the activation of the monkey 20α-hsd gene. thus, we demonstrated that monkey 20α-hsd promoter activity is regulated by the transcription factor ap- <dig> in cho-k <dig> cells.
