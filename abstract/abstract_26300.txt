BACKGROUND
the polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins  of plant cell wall limit the invasion of phytopathogenic organisms by interacting with the enzyme polygalacturonase  they secrete to degrade pectin present in the cell walls. pgips from different or same plant differ in their inhibitory activity towards the same pg. pgip <dig> from phaseolus vulgaris  inhibits the pg from fusarium moniliforme  although pgip <dig>  another member of the multigene family from the same plant sharing 99% sequence similarity, cannot. interestingly, pgip <dig> from glycine max  which is a homologue of pgip <dig> is capable of inhibiting the same pg although the extent of similarity is lower and is 88%. it therefore appears that subtle changes in the sequence of plant pgips give rise to different specificity for inhibiting pathogenic pgs and there exists no direct dependence of function on the extent of sequence similarity.


RESULTS
structural information for any pgip-pg complex being absent, we resorted to molecular modelling to gain insight into the mechanism of recognition and discrimination of pgs by pgips. we have built homology models of pvpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> using the crystal structure of pvpgip <dig>  as template. these pgips were then docked individually to fmpg to elucidate the characteristics of their interactions. the mode of binding for pvpgip <dig> to fmpg considerably differs from the mode observed for pvpgip2-fmpg complex, regardless of the high sequence similarity the two pgips share. both pvpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> despite being relatively less similar, interact with residues of fmpg that are known from mutational studies to constitute the active site of the enzyme. pvpgip <dig> tends to interact with residues not located at the active site of fmpg. looking into the electrostatic potential surface for individual pgips, it was evident that a portion of the interacting surface for pvpgip <dig> differs from the corresponding region of pvpgip <dig> or gmpgip <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
van der waals and eletrostatic interactions play an active role in pgips for proper recognition and discrimination of pgs. docking studies reveal that pvpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> interact with the residues constituting the active site of fmpg with implications that the proteins bind/block fmpg at its active site and thereby inhibit the enzyme.
