BACKGROUND
postprandial lipidemia is important in the development of coronary artery disease . consumption of a meal high in monounsaturated fat was correlated with acute impairment of endothelial function. however, the mechanisms underlying impaired endothelial function in the postprandial state have not yet been elucidated. the effects of polyunsaturated fat  and monounsaturated fat  on vascular dysfunction in intestinal postcapillary venules and arterioles were examined in wild-type  mice, mice genetically deficient in tlr <dig>  and mice pre-treated with antibiotics by intravital microscopy which was performed  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  hours after oil administration. after intravital microscopy, samples of jejunum were therefore collected to test tlr <dig>  pnf-kb p <dig> and sirt <dig> protein expression by western blotting.


RESULTS
our findings showed that feeding mono-unsaturated olive oil or polyunsaturated corn oil promoted leukocyte and platelet trafficking in the gut microvasculature, and impaired endothelium-dependent arteriolar vasodilator responses during postprandial lipidemia. the expression of tlr <dig>  pnf-kb p <dig> was significantly increased in mice gavaged with olive oil at 2 h and was significantly reduced in mice gavaged for 7 days with antibiotics and in tlr <dig> knockout  mice. at the same time, sirt <dig> protein expression is diminished by feeding olive oil for 2 h, a phenomenon that is attenuated in mice pre-treated with antibiotics and in tlr4-/- mice. corn oil treated mice exhibited a pattern of response similar to olive oil.


CONCLUSIONS
dietary oils may be negative regulators of sirt <dig> which activate the innate immune response through the endotoxin/tlr <dig> axis. our findings establish a link between innate immunity  and epigenetic controls mediated by sirt <dig> in the genesis of diet associated vascular stress.
