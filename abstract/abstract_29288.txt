BACKGROUND
glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig>  β-glucosidases have been implicated in physiologically important processes in plants, such as response to biotic and abiotic stresses, defense against herbivores, activation of phytohormones, lignification, and cell wall remodeling. plant gh <dig> β-glucosidases are encoded by a multigene family, so we predicted the structures of the genes and the properties of their protein products, and characterized their phylogenetic relationship to other plant gh <dig> members, their expression and the activity of one of them, to begin to decipher their roles in rice.


RESULTS
forty gh <dig> genes could be identified in rice databases, including  <dig> possible endophyte genes,  <dig> likely pseudogenes,  <dig> gene fragments, and  <dig> apparently competent rice glycosidase genes. phylogenetic analysis revealed that gh <dig> members with closely related sequences have similar gene structures and are often clustered together on the same chromosome. most of the genes appear to have been derived from duplications that occurred after the divergence of rice and arabidopsis thaliana lineages from their common ancestor, and the two plants share only  <dig> common gene lineages. at least  <dig> gh <dig> genes are expressed in a range of organs and stages of rice, based on the cdna and est sequences in public databases. the cdna of the os4bglu <dig> gene, which encodes a protein identical at  <dig> of  <dig> amino acid residues with the n-terminal sequence of a cell wall-bound enzyme previously purified from germinating rice, was isolated by rt-pcr from rice seedlings. a thioredoxin-os4bglu <dig> fusion protein expressed in escherichia coli efficiently hydrolyzed β--linked oligosaccharides of 3– <dig> glucose residues and laminaribiose.


CONCLUSIONS
careful analysis of the database sequences produced more reliable rice gh <dig> gene structure and protein product predictions. since most of these genes diverged after the divergence of the ancestors of rice and arabidopsis thaliana, only a few of their functions could be implied from those of gh <dig> enzymes from arabidopsis and other dicots. this implies that analysis of gh <dig> enzymes in monocots is necessary to understand their function in the major grain crops. to begin this analysis, os4bglu <dig> β-glucosidase was characterized and found to have high exoglucanase activity, consistent with a role in cell wall metabolism.
