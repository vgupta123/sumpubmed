BACKGROUND
background: cytolethal distending toxin  is one of the well-characterized virulence factors of campylobacter jejuni, but it is unknown how cdt becomes surface-exposed or is released from the bacterium to the surrounding environment.


RESULTS
our data suggest that cdt is secreted to the bacterial culture supernatant via outer membrane vesicles  released from the bacteria. all three subunits  were detected by immunogold labeling and electron microscopy of omvs. subcellular fractionation of the bacteria indicated that, apart from the majority of cdt detected in the cytoplasmic compartment, appreciable amounts  of the cellular pool of cdt proteins were present in the periplasmic compartment. in the bacterial culture supernatant, we found that a majority of the extracellular cdt was tightly associated with the omvs. isolated omvs could exert the cell distending effects typical of cdt on a human intestinal cell line, indicating that cdt is present there in a biologically active form.


CONCLUSIONS
our results strongly suggest that the release of outer membrane vesicles is functioning as a route of c. jejuni to deliver all the subunits of cdt toxin  to the surrounding environment, including infected host tissue.
