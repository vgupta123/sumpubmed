BACKGROUND
in this paper we explored thalamocortical functional connectivity in a group of eight patients suffering from peripheral neuropathic pain , and compared it with that of a group of healthy subjects. we hypothesized that functional interconnections between the thalamus and cortex can be altered after years of ongoing chronic neuropathic pain.


RESULTS
functional connectivity was studied through a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging  paradigm: temporal correlations between predefined regions of interest  and the rest of the brain were systematically investigated. the patient group showed decreased resting state functional connectivity between the thalamus and the cortex.


CONCLUSIONS
this supports the idea that chronic pain can alter thalamocortical connections causing a disruption of thalamic feedback, and the view of chronic pain as a thalamocortical dysrhythmia.
