BACKGROUND
tail anchored  membrane proteins target subcellular structures via a c-terminal transmembrane domain and serve prominent roles in membrane fusion and vesicle transport. sarcolemmal membrane associated protein  possesses two alternatively spliced tail anchors  but their specificity of subcellular targeting remains unknown.


RESULTS
ta <dig> or ta <dig> can direct slmap to reticular structures including the endoplasmic reticulum , whilst ta <dig> directs slmap additionally to the mitochondria. despite the general structural similarity of slmap to other vesicle trafficking proteins, we found no evidence for its localization with the vesicle transport machinery or a role in vesicle transport. the predicted transmembrane region of ta <dig> is flanked on either side by a positively charged amino acid and is itself less hydrophobic than the transmembrane helix present in ta <dig>  substitution of the positively charged amino acids, in the regions flanking the transmembrane helix of ta <dig>  with leucine did not alter its subcellular targeting. the targeting of slmap to the mitochondria was dependent on the hydrophobic nature of ta <dig> since targeting of slmap-ta <dig> was prevented by the substitution of leucine  for moderately hydrophobic amino acid residues within the transmembrane region. the slmap-ta2-4l mutant had a hydrophobic profile that was comparable to that of slmap-ta <dig> and had identical targeting properties to slmap-ta <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
thus the overall hydrophobicity of the two alternatively spliced tas in slmap determines its subcellular targeting and ta <dig> predominantly directs slmap to the mitochondira where it may serve roles in the function of this organelle.
