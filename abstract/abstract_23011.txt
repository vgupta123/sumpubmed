BACKGROUND
cardiovascular disease is the chief cause of death in taiwan and many countries, of which myocardial infarction  is the most serious condition. hyperlipidemia appears to be a significant cause of myocardial infarction, because it causes atherosclerosis directly. in recent years, copy number variation  has been analyzed in genomewide association studies of complex diseases. in this study, cnv was analyzed in blood samples and snp arrays from  <dig> myocardial infarction patients with hyperlipidemia.


RESULTS
we identified seven cnv regions that were associated significantly with hyperlipidemia and myocardial infarction in our patients through multistage analysis , at 1p <dig> , 1q <dig>  , 1q <dig>  , 3p <dig>  , 10q <dig>   12p <dig>   and 16q <dig>  , respectively. in particular, the cnv region at 10q <dig>  was examined by quantitative real-time pcr, the results of which were consistent with microarray findings.


CONCLUSIONS
our preliminary results constitute an alternative method of evaluating the relationship between cnv regions and cardiovascular disease. these susceptibility cnv regions may be used as biomarkers for early-stage diagnosis of hyperlipidemia and myocardial infarction, rendering them valuable for further research and discussion.
