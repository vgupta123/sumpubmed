BACKGROUND
the evolutionary highly conserved neurohypophyseal hormones oxytocin and arginine vasopressin play key roles in regulating social cognition and behaviours. the effects of these two peptides are meditated by their specific receptors, which are encoded by the oxytocin receptor  and arginine vasopressin receptor 1a genes , respectively. in several species, polymorphisms in these genes have been linked to various behavioural traits. little, however, is known about whether positive selection acts on sequence variants in genes influencing variation in human behaviours.


RESULTS
we identified, in both neuroreceptor genes, signatures of balancing selection in the cis-regulative acting sequences such as transcription factor binding and enhancer sequences, as well as in a transcriptional repressor sequence motif. additionally, in the intron  <dig> of the oxtr gene, the snp rs <dig> appears to be under positive directional selection. for rs <dig>  only one phenotypical association is known so far, but it is in high ld’  with loci of known association; i.e., variants associated with key pro-social behaviours and mental disorders in humans.


CONCLUSIONS
only for one snp on the oxtr gene  was a sign of positive directional selection detected with all three methods of selection detection. for rs <dig>  however, only one phenotypical association is known, but rs <dig> is in high ld’ , with variants associated with important pro-social behaviours and mental disorders in humans. we also detected various signatures of balancing selection on both neuroreceptor genes.
