BACKGROUND
in this study, we addressed whether a single  <dig> life science gs <dig> sequencing run provides new gene discovery from a normalized cdna library, and whether the short reads produced via this technology are of value in gene structure annotation.


RESULTS
a single  <dig> gs <dig> sequencing run on adapter-ligated cdna, from a normalized cdna library, generated  <dig>  reads that were reduced to  <dig>  reads with an average read length of  <dig> nucleotides after cleaning. after clustering and assembly, a total of  <dig>  unique sequences were generated containing over  <dig> ssrs. the  <dig> sequences generated hits to more genes than a comparable amount of sequence from mtgi. although short, the  <dig> reads are of sufficient length to map to a unique genome location as effectively as longer ests produced by conventional sequencing. functional interpretation of the sequences was carried out by gene ontology assignments from matches to arabidopsis and was shown to cover a broad range of go categories.  <dig>  assemblies and singletons  had no match in the existing mtgi. within the previously unobserved medicago transcripts, thousands had matches in a comprehensive protein database and one or more of the tigr plant gene indices. approximately 20% of these novel sequences could be found in the medicago genome sequence. a total of  <dig>  reads generated by the  <dig> technology were mapped to  <dig> medicago finished bacs using pasa and over  <dig>  gene models required modification. in parallel to  <dig> sequencing,  <dig>  5'-prime reads were generated by conventional sequencing using the same library and from the assembled sequences it was shown to contain about 52% full length cdnas encoding proteins from  <dig> to over  <dig> amino acids in length.


CONCLUSIONS
due to the large number of reads afforded by the  <dig> dna sequencing technology, it is effective in revealing the expression of transcripts from a broad range of go categories and contains many rare transcripts in normalized cdna libraries, although only a limited portion of their sequence is uncovered. as with longer ests,  <dig> reads can be mapped uniquely onto genomic sequence to provide support for, and modifications of, gene predictions.
