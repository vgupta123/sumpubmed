BACKGROUND
vibrio vulnificus is the leading cause of reported death from consumption of seafood in the united states. despite several decades of research on molecular pathogenesis, much remains to be learned about the mechanisms of virulence of this opportunistic bacterial pathogen. the two complete and annotated genomic dna sequences of v. vulnificus belong to strains of clade  <dig>  which is the predominant clade among clinical strains. clade  <dig> strains generally possess higher virulence potential in animal models of disease compared with clade  <dig>  which predominates among environmental strains. solid sequencing of four v. vulnificus strains representing different clades  and biotypes  was used for comparative genomic analysis.


RESULTS
greater than  <dig> , <dig> bases were sequenced of each strain, yielding approximately 100-fold coverage for each of the four genomes. although the read lengths of solid genomic sequencing were only  <dig> nt, we were able to make significant conclusions about the unique and shared sequences among the genomes, including identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms. comparative analysis of the newly sequenced genomes to the existing reference genomes enabled the identification of  <dig>  core v. vulnificus genes shared among all six strains and  <dig> clade 2-specific genes. we identified  <dig>  snps among the six genomes.


CONCLUSIONS
we were able to glean much information about the genomic content of each strain using next generation sequencing. flp pili, ggdef proteins, and genomic island xii were identified as possible virulence factors because of their presence in virulent sequenced strains. genomic comparisons also point toward the involvement of sialic acid catabolism in pathogenesis.
