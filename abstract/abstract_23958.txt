BACKGROUND
to obtain insights into escherichia coli o157:h <dig>  survival mechanisms in the bovine rumen, we defined the growth characteristics and proteome of o <dig> cultured in rumen fluid  obtained from rumen-fistulated cattle fed low protein content “maintenance diet” under diverse in vitro conditions.


RESULTS
bottom-up proteomics  of whole cell-lysates of o <dig> cultured under anaerobic conditions in filter-sterilized rf  and nutrient-depleted and filtered rf  resulted in an anaerobic o <dig> frf-and drf-proteome comprising  <dig> proteins functionally associated with cell structure, motility, transport, metabolism and regulation, but interestingly, not with o <dig> virulence. shotgun proteomics-based analysis using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation used to further study differential protein expression in unfiltered rf  complemented these results.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that in the rumen, the first anatomical compartment encountered by this human pathogen within the cattle gastrointestinal tract , o <dig> initiates a program of specific gene expression that enables it to adapt to the in vivo environment, and successfully transit to its colonization sites in the bovine git. further experiments in vitro using urf from animals fed different diets and with additional o <dig> strains, and in vivo using rumen-fistulated cattle will provide a comprehensive understanding of the adaptive mechanisms involved, and help direct evolution of novel modalities for blocking o <dig> infection of cattle.
