BACKGROUND
podoplanin is a membrane mucin that, among a series of tissues, is expressed on late osteoblasts and osteocytes. since recent findings have focussed on podoplanin's potential role as a tumour progression factor, we aimed at identifying regulatory elements conferring pdpn promoter activity. here, we characterized the molecular mechanism controlling basal pdpn transcription in human osteoblast-like mg <dig> versus saos- <dig> cells.


RESULTS
we cloned and sequenced  <dig> nucleotides from the 5'-flanking region of the pdpn gene and a computational search revealed that the tata and caat box-lacking promoter possesses features of a growth-related gene, such as a gc-rich 5' region and the presence of multiple putative sp <dig>  ap- <dig> and nf- <dig> sites. reporter gene assays demonstrated a functional promoter in mg <dig> cells exhibiting 30-fold more activity than in saos- <dig> cells. in vitro dnase i footprinting revealed eight protected regions flanked by dnasei hypersensitive sites within the region bp - <dig> to - <dig> present in mg <dig>  but not in saos- <dig> cells. among these regions, mutation and supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assays  identified four sp1/sp <dig> binding sites and two binding sites for yet unknown transcription factors. deletion studies demonstrated the functional importance of two sp1/sp <dig> sites for pdpn promoter activity. overexpression of sp <dig> and sp <dig> independently increased the stimulatory effect of the promoter and podoplanin mrna levels in mg <dig> and saos- <dig> cells. in sl <dig> cells, sp <dig> functioned as a repressor, while sp <dig> and sp <dig> acted positively synergistic. weak pdpn promoter activity of saos- <dig> cells correlated with low sp1/sp <dig> nuclear levels, which was confirmed by sp1/sp <dig> chromatin immunoprecipitations in vivo. moreover, methylation-sensitive southern blot analyses and bisulfite sequencing detected strong methylation of cpg sites upstream of bp - <dig> in mg <dig> cells, but hypomethylation of these sites in saos- <dig> cells. concomitantly, treatment with the dna methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacdr in combination with trichostatin a  downregulated podoplanin mrna levels in mg <dig> cells, and region-specific in vitro methylation of the distal promoter suggested that dna methylation rather enhanced than hindered pdpn transcription in both cell types.


CONCLUSIONS
these data establish that in human osteoblast-like mg <dig> cells, sp <dig> and sp <dig> stimulate basal pdpn transcription in a concerted, yet independent manner, whereas saos- <dig> cells lack sufficient nuclear sp protein amounts for transcriptional activation. moreover, a highly methylated chromatin conformation of the distal promoter region confers cell-type specific podoplanin upregulation versus saos- <dig> cells.
