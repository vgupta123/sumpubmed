BACKGROUND

salmonella typhimurium  inactivated by a regulated autolysis system was genetically engineered to express the homo-pentameric b subunit of shiga toxin 2e  on its surface. to prepare a strain able to yield autolyzed salmonella bearing stx2eb, the plasmid pjhl <dig> harboring stx
2eb gene was transformed into the attenuated s. typhimurium strain, jol <dig>  stx2eb subcloned into the antigen delivery cassette of the plasmid was expressed as fusion protein with the outer membrane protein


RESULTS
the expression of stx2eb fused to the signal peptide in jol <dig> was validated by immunoblot analysis. to determine the immunogenicity of jol <dig>  female balb/c mice were intramuscularly injected with 1 × 108 cfu of the inactivated cells at weeks  <dig> and  <dig>  significantly elevated levels of igg and iga specific to stx2eb was observed at weeks  <dig> and  <dig> post-immunization  . proportion of cd3+cd4+ t lymphocyte subpopulation was also significantly augmented in in vivo stimulated splenocytes relative to that in the control group. the increased titers of igg <dig> and igg2a, and of immunomodulatory cytokines indicated that the immunization elicited th <dig> and th <dig> immune responses. further, immunomodulatory cytokine genes  efficiently upregulated in naïve porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells  pulsed with jol <dig>  at week  <dig> pi, following the challenge with a virulent stx2e-producing escherichia coli in the mice, all immunized mice survived whereas approximately 30% of the mice in the control group died.


CONCLUSIONS
jol <dig> provided superior immunogenicity and effective protection against challenge with a sublethal dose, which demonstrates its potential as a candidate vaccine against edema disease.
