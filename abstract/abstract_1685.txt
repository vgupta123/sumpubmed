BACKGROUND
yb- <dig> is a major regulator of gene expression in eukaryotic cells. in addition to its role in transcription, yb- <dig> plays a key role in translation and stabilization of mrnas.


RESULTS
we show here that yb- <dig> interacts with tubulin and microtubules and stimulates microtubule assembly in vitro. high resolution imaging via electron and atomic force microscopy revealed that microtubules assembled in the presence of yb- <dig> exhibited a normal single wall ultrastructure and indicated that yb- <dig> most probably coats the outer microtubule wall. furthermore, we found that yb- <dig> also promotes the assembly of maps-tubulin and subtilisin-treated tubulin. finally, we demonstrated that tubulin interferes with rna:yb- <dig> complexes.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that yb- <dig> may regulate microtubule assembly in vivo and that its interaction with tubulin may contribute to the control of mrna translation.
