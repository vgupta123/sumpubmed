BACKGROUND
microarray normalizations typically apply methods that assume absence of global transcript shifts, or absence of changes in internal control features such as housekeeping genes. these normalization approaches are not appropriate for focused arrays with small sets of genes where a large portion may be expected to change. furthermore, many microarrays lack control features that can be used for quality assurance . here, we describe a novel external control series integrated with a design feature that addresses the above issues.


RESULTS
an ec dilution series that involves spike-in of a single concentration of the a. thaliana chlorophyll synthase gene to hybridize against spotted dilutions  of a single complimentary oligonucleotide representing the gene was developed. the ec series is printed in duplicate within each subgrid of the microarray and covers the full range of signal intensities from background to saturation. the design and placement of the series allows for qa examination of frequently encountered problems in hybridization  and printing . additionally, we demonstrate that the series can be integrated with a lowess normalization to improve the detection of differential gene expression  over lowess normalization on its own.


CONCLUSIONS
the quality of microarray experiments and the normalization methods used affect the ability to measure accurate changes in gene expression. novel methods are required for normalization of small focused microarrays, and for incorporating measures of performance and quality. we demonstrate that dilution of oligonucleotides on the microarray itself provides an innovative approach allowing the full dynamic range of the scanner to be covered with a single gene spike-in. the dilution series can be used in a composite normalization to improve detection of differential gene expression and to provide quality control measures.
