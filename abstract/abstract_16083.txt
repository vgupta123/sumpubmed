BACKGROUND
rapid diagnosis and surveillance for h <dig> subtype viruses are critical for the control of h5n <dig> infection.


RESULTS
in this study, h <dig> dot elisa, a rapid test for the detection of avian h5n <dig> influenza virus, was developed with two complementary h <dig> monoclonal antibodies. ha sequencing of escape mutants followed by epitope mapping revealed that the two mabs target the epitope component  on the ha protein but are specific for different amino acids . gene alignment indicated that these two amino acids are the most frequent types on this position among all of the h <dig> aiv reported in genebank. these two h <dig> mabs were used together in a dot elisa to detect h <dig> viral antigen. the detection limit of the developed test for multiple clades of h5n <dig> viruses, including clades  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  was less than  <dig>  hemagglutinin units. the specificity of the optimized dot elisa was examined by using  <dig> h <dig> strains, including h5n <dig> hpai strains from multiple clades,  <dig> non-h5n <dig> viruses, and  <dig> influenza b viruses. no cross-reactivity was observed for any of the non-h5n <dig> viruses tested. among  <dig> random poultry samples, the test gave 100% positive results for all of the twelve rt-pcr-positive samples.


CONCLUSIONS
considering that the test is convenient for field use, this h <dig> dot elisa can be used for on-site detection of h5n <dig> infection in clinical or environmental specimens and facilitate the investigation of h5n <dig> influenza outbreaks and surveillance in poultry.
