BACKGROUND
sesame is an important high-quality oil seed crop. the sesame genome was de novo sequenced and assembled in  <dig> ; however, the number of anchored pseudomolecules was higher than the chromosome number  due to the lack of a high-density genetic map with  <dig> linkage groups.


RESULTS
we resequenced a permanent population consisting of  <dig> recombinant inbred lines and constructed a genetic map to improve the sesame genome assembly. we successfully anchored  <dig> scaffolds onto  <dig> pseudomolecules. the new genome assembly  included  <dig>  % of the scaffolds greater than 150 kb in size present in assembly version  <dig>  and increased the total pseudomolecule length from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb with  <dig>  % of the genome assembled and  <dig>  % of the predicted gene models anchored. based on the new genome assembly, a bin map including  <dig>  bins spanning  <dig>  cm was generated and used to identified  <dig> quantitative trait loci  for sesame plant height and  <dig> for seed coat color. the plant height-related qtls explained 3–24 % the phenotypic variation , and  <dig> of them were detected in at least two field trials. two major loci  that contributed  <dig> and 18 % of the plant height were located in  <dig> and 928-kb spaces on chr <dig> and chr <dig>  respectively. qph- <dig> , is predicted to be responsible for the semi-dwarf sesame plant phenotype and contains  <dig> candidate genes. this is the first report of a sesame semi-dwarf locus and provides an interesting opportunity for a plant architecture study of the sesame. for the sesame seed coat color, the qtls of the color spaces l*, a*, and b* were detected with contribution rates of 3–46 %. qscb- <dig>  contributed approximately 39 % of the b* value and was located on chr <dig> in a  <dig> -kb space. a list of  <dig> candidate genes for the locus, including a predicted black seed coat-related gene, was determined by screening the newly anchored genome.


CONCLUSIONS
this study offers a high-density genetic map and an improved assembly of the sesame genome. the number of linkage groups and pseudomolecules in this assembly equals the number of sesame chromosomes for the first time. the map and updated genome assembly are expected to serve as a platform for future comparative genomics and genetic studies.
