BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori colonizes the human stomach and is the etiological agent of peptic ulcer disease. all three h. pylori strains that have been sequenced to date contain a potential operon whose products share homology with the subunits of acetone carboxylase  from xanthobacter autotrophicus strain py <dig> and rhodobacter capsulatus strain b <dig>  acetone carboxylase catalyzes the conversion of acetone to acetoacetate. genes upstream of the putative acxabc operon encode enzymes that convert acetoacetate to acetoacetyl-coa, which is metabolized further to generate two molecules of acetyl-coa.


RESULTS
to determine if the h. pylori acxabc operon has a role in host colonization the acxb homolog in the mouse-adapted h. pylori ss <dig> strain was inactivated with a chloramphenicol-resistance  cassette. in mouse colonization studies the numbers of h. pylori recovered from mice inoculated with the acxb:cat mutant were generally one to two orders of magnitude lower than those recovered from mice inoculated with the parental strain. a statistical analysis of the data using a wilcoxin rank test indicated the differences in the numbers of h. pylori isolated from mice inoculated with the two strains were significant at the 99% confidence level. levels of acetone associated with gastric tissue removed from uninfected mice were measured and found to range from 10– <dig> μmols per gram wet weight tissue.


CONCLUSIONS
the colonization defect of the acxb:cat mutant suggests a role for the acxabc operon in survival of the bacterium in the stomach. products of the h. pylori acxabc operon may function primarily in acetone utilization or may catalyze a related reaction that is important for survival or growth in the host. h. pylori encounters significant levels of acetone in the stomach which it could use as a potential electron donor for microaerobic respiration.
