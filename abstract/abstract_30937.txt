BACKGROUND
new methods are needed for research into non-model organisms, to monitor the effects of toxic disruption at both the molecular and functional organism level. we exposed earthworms  to sub-lethal levels of copper  for  <dig> days as a real-world situation, and monitored both molecular  and ecological/functional endpoints .


RESULTS
both of the molecular endpoints, metabolomics and transcriptomics, were highly sensitive, with clear copper-induced differences even at levels below those that caused a reduction in reproductive parameters. the microarray and metabolomic data provided evidence that the copper exposure led to a disruption of energy metabolism: transcripts of enzymes from oxidative phosphorylation were significantly over-represented, and increases in transcripts of carbohydrate metabolising enzymes  had corresponding decreases in small-molecule metabolites . treating both enzymes and metabolites as functional cohorts led to clear inferences about changes in energetic metabolism , which would not have been possible by taking a 'biomarker' approach to data analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
multiple post-genomic techniques can be combined to provide mechanistic information about the toxic effects of chemical contaminants, even for non-model organisms with few additional mechanistic toxicological data. with 70-day no-observed-effect and lowest-observed-effect concentrations  of  <dig> and  <dig> mg kg- <dig> for metabolomic and microarray profiles, copper is shown to interfere with energy metabolism in an important soil organism at an ecologically and functionally relevant level.
