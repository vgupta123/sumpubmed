BACKGROUND
collagen-like surface proteins scl <dig> and scl <dig> on streptococcus pyogenes contain contiguous gly-x-x triplet amino acid motifs, the characteristic structure of human collagen. although the potential role of scl <dig> in adhesion has been studied, the conclusions may be affected by the use of different s. pyogenes strains and their carriages of various adhesins. to explore the bona fide nature of scl <dig> in adherence to human epithelial cells without the potential interference of other streptococcal surface factors, we constructed a scl <dig> isogenic mutant from the scl2-defective s. pyogenes strain and a scl1-expressed escherichia coli.


RESULTS
loss of scl <dig> in a scl2-defective s. pyogenes strain dramatically decreased the adhesion of bacteria to hep- <dig> human epithelial cells. expression of scl <dig> on the surface of the heterologous bacteria e. coli significantly increased adhesion to hep- <dig>  the increase in adhesion was nullified when scl1-expressed e. coli was pre-incubated with proteases or antibodies against recombinant scl <dig>  protein. treatment of hep- <dig> cells with rscl protein or pronase drastically reduced the binding capability of scl1-expressed e. coli. these findings suggest that the adhesion is mediated through scl <dig> on bacterial surface and protein receptor on epithelial cells. further blocking of potential integrins revealed significant contributions of α <dig> and β <dig> integrins in scl1-mediated binding to epithelial cells.


CONCLUSIONS
together, these results underscore the importance of scl <dig> in the virulence of s. pyogenes and implicate scl <dig> as an adhesin during pathogenesis of streptococcal infection.
