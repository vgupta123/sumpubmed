BACKGROUND
glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, primarily through n-methyl-d-aspartate  receptors, may be an important cause of retinal ganglion cells  death in glaucoma and several other retinal diseases. bis-tacrine is a noncompetitive nmda receptors antagonist that can prevent glutamate-induced hippocampal neurons damage. we tested the effects of bis-tacrine against glutamate-induced rat rgcs damage in vitro and in vivo.


RESULTS
in cultured neonatal rats rgcs, the mtt assay showed that glutamate induced a concentration- and time-dependent toxicity. bis-tacrine and memantine prevented glutamate-induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner with ic <dig> values of  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm, respectively. the anti-apoptosis effects of bis-tacrine were confirmed by annexin v-fitc/pi staining. in vivo, tunel analysis and retrograde labeling analysis found that pretreatment with bis-tacrine induced a significant neuroprotective effect against glutamate-induced rgcs damage.


CONCLUSIONS
our results showed that bis-tacrine had neuroprotective effects against glutamate-induced rgcs damage in vitro and in vivo, possibly through the drug's anti-nmda receptor effects. these findings make bis-tacrine potentially useful for treating a variety of ischemic or traumatic retinopathies inclusive of glaucoma.
