BACKGROUND
epifluorescence microscopy is a common method used to enumerate virus-like particles  from environmental samples and relies on the use of filter membranes with pore sizes <  <dig>  μm; the most commonly used protocols employ  <dig> mm anodisc™ membranes with a built-in support ring. other filters with small pore sizes exist, including the  <dig> mm anodisc™ membranes without a support ring. however, the use of these membranes for viral enumeration has not been previously reported.


RESULTS
here we describe a modified protocol for  <dig> mm anodisc membranes that uses a custom filter holder that can be readily constructed in individual investigators' laboratories from commercially available swinnex® filter holders. we compared vlp concentrations obtained from phage lysates and seawater samples using both anodisc membranes, as well as nuclepore™ small pore-size membranes . the  <dig> mm anodisc membranes gave comparable estimates of vlp abundance to those obtained with the  <dig> mm anodisc membranes when similar staining methods were employed. both nuclepore membranes typically gave an order of magnitude lower vlp abundance values for environmental samples.


CONCLUSIONS
the  <dig> mm anodisc membranes are less costly and require smaller sample volumes than their  <dig> mm counterpart making them ideal for large-scale studies and sample replication. this method increases the options of reliable approaches available for quantifying vlp from environmental samples.
