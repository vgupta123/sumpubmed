BACKGROUND
the arginine of the d/e/nry motif in rhodopsin family g protein-coupled receptors  is conserved in 96% of these proteins. in some gpcrs, this arginine in transmembrane  <dig> can form a salt bridge with an aspartic acid or glutamic acid in transmembrane  <dig>  the drosophila melanogaster gpcr trapped in endoderm- <dig>  is required for normal primordial germ cell migration. in a mutant form of the protein, tre1sctt, eight amino acids ryiliach are missing, resulting in a severe disruption of primordial germ cell development. the impact of the loss of these amino acids on tre <dig> structure is unknown. since the missing amino acids in tre1sctt include the arginine that is part of the d/e/nry motif in tre <dig>  molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore the hypothesis that these amino acids are involved in salt bridge formation and help maintain tre <dig> structure.


RESULTS
structural predictions of wild type tre <dig>  and tre1sctt were subjected to over 250Â ns of molecular dynamics simulations. the ability of the model systems to form a salt bridge between the arginine of the d/e/nry motif and an aspartic acid residue in transmembrane  <dig> was analyzed. the results indicate that a stable salt bridge can form in the tre1+ systems and a weak salt bridge or no salt bridge, using an alternative arginine, is likely in the tre1sctt systems.


CONCLUSIONS
the weak salt bridge or lack of a salt bridge in the tre1sctt systems could be one possible explanation for the disrupted function of tre1sctt in primordial germ cell migration. these results provide a framework for studying the importance of the arginine of the d/e/nry motif in the structure and function of other gpcrs that are involved in cell migration, such as cxcr <dig> in the mouse, zebrafish, and chicken.
