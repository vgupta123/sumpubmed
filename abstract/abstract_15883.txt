BACKGROUND
the engineering of ontologies, especially with a view to a text-mining use, is still a new research field. there does not yet exist a well-defined theory and technology for ontology construction. many of the ontology design steps remain manual and are based on personal experience and intuition. however, there exist a few efforts on automatic construction of ontologies in the form of extracted lists of terms and relations between them.


RESULTS
we share experience acquired during the manual development of a lipoprotein metabolism ontology  to be used for text-mining. we compare the manually created ontology terms with the automatically derived terminology from four different automatic term recognition  methods. the top  <dig> predicted terms contain up to 89% relevant terms. for the top  <dig> terms the best method still generates 51% relevant terms. in a corpus of  <dig> documents 53% of lmo terms are contained and 38% can be generated with one of the methods.


CONCLUSIONS
given high precision, automatic methods can help decrease development time and provide significant support for the identification of domain-specific vocabulary. the coverage of the domain vocabulary depends strongly on the underlying documents. ontology development for text mining should be performed in a semi-automatic way; taking atr results as input and following the guidelines we described.
