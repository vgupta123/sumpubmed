BACKGROUND
mfn <dig> is a clinical pseudomonas fluorescens strain able to grow at 37°c. mfn <dig> cells induce necrosis and apoptosis in rat glial cells at this temperature. this strain displays secretion-mediated hemolytic activity involving phospholipase c and cyclolipopeptides. under laboratory conditions, this activity is not expressed at 37°c. this activity is tightly regulated and is subject to phase variation.


RESULTS
we found that mfn <dig> displays a cell-associated hemolytic activity distinct from the secreted hemolytic activity. cell-associated hemolysis was expressed at 37°c and was only detected in vitro in mid log growth phase in the presence of erythrocytes. we studied the regulation of this activity in the wild-type strain and in a mutant defective in the gac two-component pathway. gacs/gaca is a negative regulator of this activity. in contrast to the pseudomonas fluorescens strains pfo- <dig> and pf <dig>  whose genomes have been sequenced, the mfn <dig> strain has the type iii secretion-like genes hrcrst belonging to the hrpu operon. we showed that disruption of this operon abolished cell-associated hemolytic activity. this activity was not detected in p.fluorescens strains carrying similar hrc genes, as for the p. fluorescens psychrotrophic strain mf <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge this the first demonstration of cell-associated hemolytic activity of a clinical strain of pseudomonas fluorescens. moreover, this activity seems to be related to a functional hrpu operon and is independent of biosurfactant production. precise link between a functional hrpu operon and cell-associated hemolytic activity remains to be elucidated.
