BACKGROUND
genomic diversity of h. pylori from many different human populations is largely unknown. we compared genomes of  <dig> h. pylori strains from nottingham, england. molecular analysis was carried out to identify rearrangements within and outside the cag-pathogenicity-island  and dna sequence divergence in candidate genes. phylogenetic analysis was carried out based on various high-resolution genotyping techniques.


RESULTS
analyses of virulence genes  revealed that h. pylori strains from england are genetically distinct from strains obtained from other countries. the toxigenic vaca s1m <dig> genotype was found to be less common and the plasticity region cluster was found to be disrupted in all the isolates. english isolates showed a predominance of icea <dig> alleles and a functional proinflammatory oipa gene. the english h. pylori gene pool revealed several asian/oriental features. this included the predominance of caga â€“ glr  motif types iii and ii , presence of vaca m1c alleles and phylogenetic affinity towards east asian / amerindian gene pools based on fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism  analysis and glmm sequence analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, our results demonstrated genetic affinities of h. pylori in england with both european and the asian gene pools and some distinctive genetic features of virulence genes that may have evolved in this important european population.
