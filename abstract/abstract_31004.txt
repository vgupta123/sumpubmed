BACKGROUND
serine–arginine rich splicing factor  <dig>  is a protein known for its role in rna splicing and genome stability. it has been recently discovered that srsf <dig>  along with other splicing regulators, is frequently mutated in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome . the most common mds mutations in srsf <dig> occur at proline 95; the mutant proteins are shown to have different rna binding preferences, which may contribute to splicing changes detected in mutant cells. however, the influence of these srsf <dig> mds-associated mutations on specific splicing events remains poorly understood.


RESULTS
a tetracycline-inducible tf- <dig> erythroleukemia cell line was transduced with retroviruses to create cell lines expressing ha-tagged wildtype srsf <dig>  srsf <dig> with proline  <dig> point mutations found in mds, or srsf <dig> with a deletion of one of the four major domains of the protein. effects of these mutants on apoptosis and specific alternative splicing events were evaluated. cells were also treated with dna damaging drugs for comparison. mds-related p <dig> point mutants of srsf <dig> were expressed and phosphorylated at similar levels as wildtype srsf <dig>  however, cells expressing mutant srsf <dig> exhibited higher levels of apoptosis than cells expressing wildtype srsf <dig>  regarding alternative splicing events, in nearly all examined cases, srsf <dig> p <dig> mutants acted in a similar fashion as the wildtype srsf <dig>  however, cells expressing srsf <dig> p <dig> mutants had a percent increase in the c <dig> spliced isoform of cell division cycle 25c . the same alternative splicing of cdc25c was detected by treating cells with dna damaging drugs, such as cisplatin, camptothecin, and trichostatin a at appropriate dosage. however, unlike dna damaging drugs, srsf <dig> p <dig> mutants did not activate the ataxia telangiectasia mutated  pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
srsf <dig> p <dig> mutants lead to alternative splicing of cdc25c in a manner that is not dependent on the dna damage response.
