BACKGROUND
microvascular alterations contribute to the development of stroke and vascular dementia. the goal of this study was to evaluate age and hypertension related changes of the basal lamina in cerebral microvessels of individuals, who died from non-cerebral causes.


RESULTS
we examined  <dig> human brains:  <dig> young and  <dig> old patients. old patients were divided into two subgroups, those with hypertension  and those without hypertension . basal lamina changes of the cerebral microvessels were determined in the putamen using antibodies against collagen type iv and by quantitative analysis of vessel number, total stained area of collagen, thickness of the vessel wall and lumen, and relative staining intensity using immunofluorescence. the total number of collagen positive vessels per microscopic field was reduced in old compared to young subjects . the relative collagen content per vessel  and the relative collagen intensity  shown by immunofluorescence were higher in the older compared to the younger patients with a consecutive reduction of the lumen / wall ratio . no differences were observed for these parameters between old hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients.


CONCLUSIONS
the present data show age-related changes of the cerebral microvessels in sections of human putamen for the first time. due to the accumulation of collagen, microvessels thicken and show a reduction in their lumen. besides this, the number of vessels decreases. these findings might represent a precondition for the development of vascular cognitive impairment. however, hypertension was not proven to modulate these changes.
