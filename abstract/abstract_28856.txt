BACKGROUND
the ramachandran plot is a fundamental tool in the analysis of protein structures. of the  <dig> basic types of ramachandran plots, the interactions that determine the generic and proline ramachandran plots are well understood. the interactions of the glycine and pre-proline ramachandran plots are not.


RESULTS
in glycine, the ψ angle is typically clustered at ψ = 180° and ψ = 0°. we show that these clusters correspond to conformations where either the ni+ <dig> or o atom is sandwiched between the two hα atoms of glycine. we show that the shape of the  <dig> distinct regions of density  can be reproduced with electrostatic dipole-dipole interactions. in pre-proline, we analyse the origin of the ζ region of the ramachandran plot, a region unique to pre-proline. we show that it is stabilized by a coi-1···cδhδi+ <dig> weak hydrogen bond. this is analogous to the coi-1···nhi+ <dig> hydrogen bond that stabilizes the γ region in the generic ramachandran plot.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified the specific interactions that affect the backbone of glycine and pre-proline. knowledge of these interactions will improve current force-fields, and help understand structural motifs containing these residues.
