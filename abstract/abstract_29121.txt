BACKGROUND

porphyromonas gingivalis is strongly associated with the development, progression, severity and recurrence of periodontitis. periodontal ligament stem cells  play an important role in the maintenance of periodontal tissue self-renewal and repair. the purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of p. gingivalis to infect pdlscs using an in vitro monolayer model.

methods
we separated and cultured primary pdlscs using the tissue block with limiting dilution method. the efficiency of p. gingivalis  infection of pdlscs was measured using agar plate culture and quantitative polymerase chain reaction  methods. pdlscs infected with p. gingivalis were also observed by transmission electron microscopy.


RESULTS
we assessed stem cell properties including cell morphology, clone formation, growth activity, cell surface antigens and multiple differentiation capacity. the infection rates of p. gingivalis in pdlsc at mois of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % according to the agar plate culture method. by q-pcr, the efficiencies of p. gingivalis infection of pdlscs at mois of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. overall, the infection efficiency based on q-pcr was higher than that according to agar plate culture. using transmission electron microscopy, we verified that p. gingivalis  could infect and invade pdlscs after 2 h of incubation, and endocytic vacuoles were not found surrounding the internalized bacteria.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our data demonstrate that p. gingivalis can invade pdlscs.
