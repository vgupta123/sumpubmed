BACKGROUND
as context is important to gene expression, so is the preprocessing of microarray to transcriptomics. microarray data suffers from several normalization and significance problems. arbitrary fold change  cut-offs of > <dig> and significance p-values of < <dig>  lead data collection to look only at genes which vary wildly amongst other genes. therefore, questions arise as to whether the biology or the statistical cutoff are more important within the interpretation. in this paper, we reanalyzed a zebrafish  microarray data set using genespring and different differential gene expression cut-offs and found the data interpretation was drastically different. furthermore, despite the advances in microarray technology, the array captures a large portion of genes known but yet still leaving large voids in the number of genes assayed, such as leptin a pleiotropic hormone directly related to hypoxia-induced angiogenesis.


RESULTS
the data strongly suggests that the number of differentially expressed genes is more up-regulated than down-regulated, with many genes indicating conserved signalling to previously known functions. recapitulated data from marques et al.  was similar but surprisingly different with some genes showing unexpected signalling which may be a product of tissue  or that the intended response was transient.


CONCLUSIONS
our analyses suggest that based on the chosen statistical or fold change cut-off; microarray analysis can provide essentially more than one answer, implying data interpretation as more of an art than a science, with follow up gene expression studies a must. furthermore, gene chip annotation and development needs to maintain pace with not only new genomes being sequenced but also novel genes that are crucial to the overall gene chips interpretation.
