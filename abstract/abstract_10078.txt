BACKGROUND
webtag is a tool providing oligonucleotide sequences  that are absent from a specified genome. these tags/anchors can be appended to gene specific primers for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction experiments, circumventing genomic dna contamination.


RESULTS
the use of a relational database, in conjunction with a series of scripts written in php and perl, allows the user to rapidly obtain tags that are: 1) suitable for a specific organism, and 2) compatible with other oligonucleotides to be used in the experimental procedures.


CONCLUSIONS
this new web tool allows scientists to easily and rapidly obtain suitable tags for rt-pcr experiments, and is available at .
