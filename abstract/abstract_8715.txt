BACKGROUND
ubiquitination is mediated by the sequential action of at least three enzymes: the e <dig> , e <dig>  and e <dig>  proteins. polyubiquitination of target proteins is also implicated in several critical cellular processes. although arabidopsis genome research has estimated more than  <dig>  proteins involved in ubiquitination, little is known about the biochemical functions of these proteins. here we demonstrate a novel, simple and high-sensitive method for in vitro analysis of ubiquitination and polyubiquitination based on wheat cell-free protein synthesis and luminescent detection.


RESULTS
using wheat cell-free synthesis,  <dig> e <dig> proteins from arabidopsis full-length cdna templates were produced. these proteins were analyzed either in the translation mixture or purified recombinant protein from the translation mixture. in our luminescent method using flag- or his-tagged and biotinylated ubiquitins, the polyubiquitin chain on atubc <dig>  upl <dig> and upl <dig>  and cip <dig>  was detected. also, binding of ubiquitin to these proteins was detected using biotinylated ubiquitin and flag-tagged recombinant protein. furthermore, screening of the ring  <dig> subgroup demonstrated that at1g <dig> was capable of polyubiquitin chain formation like cip <dig>  interestingly, these ubiquitinations were carried out without the addition of exogenous e <dig> and/or e <dig> proteins, indicating that these enzymes were endogenous to the wheat cell-free system. the amount of polyubiquitinated proteins in the crude translation reaction mixture was unaffected by treatment with mg <dig>  suggesting that our system does not contain 26s proteasome-dependent protein degradation activity.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we developed a simple wheat cell-free based luminescence method that could be a powerful tool for comprehensive ubiquitination analysis.
