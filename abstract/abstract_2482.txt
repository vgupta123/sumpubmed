BACKGROUND
mecp <dig> null mice model rett syndrome  a human neurological disorder affecting females after apparent normal pre- and peri-natal developmental periods. neuroanatomical studies in cerebral cortex of rtt mouse models revealed delayed maturation of neuronal morphology and autonomous as well as non-cell autonomous reduction in dendritic complexity of postnatal cortical neurons. however, both morphometric parameters and high-resolution expression profile of cortical neurons at embryonic developmental stage have not yet been studied. here we address these topics by using embryonic neuronal primary cultures from mecp <dig> loss of function mouse model.


RESULTS
we show that embryonic primary cortical neurons of mecp <dig> null mice display reduced neurite complexity possibly reflecting transcriptional changes. we used rna-sequencing coupled with a bioinformatics comparative approach to identify and remove the contribution of variable and hard to quantify non-neuronal brain cells present in our in vitro cell cultures.


CONCLUSIONS
our results support the need to investigate both mecp <dig> morphological as well as molecular effect in neurons since prenatal developmental stage, long time before onset of rett symptoms.
