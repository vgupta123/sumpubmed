BACKGROUND
the use of self-generated and externally provided information in performance monitoring is reflected by the appearance of error-related and feedback-related negativities , respectively. several authors proposed that ern and frn are supported by similar neural mechanisms residing in the anterior cingulate cortex  and the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. the present study is aimed to test the functional relationship between ern and frn. using an eriksen-flanker task with a moving response deadline we tested  <dig> young healthy subjects. subjects received feedback with respect to their response accuracy and response speed. to fulfill both requirements of the task, they had to press the correct button and had to respond in time to give a valid response.


RESULTS
when performance monitoring based on self-generated information was sufficient to detect a criterion violation an ern was released, while the subsequent feedback became redundant and therefore failed to trigger an frn. in contrast, an frn was released if the feedback contained information which was not available before and action monitoring processes based on self-generated information failed to detect an error.


CONCLUSIONS
the described pattern of results indicates a functional interrelationship of response and feedback related negativities in performance monitoring.
