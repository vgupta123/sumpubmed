BACKGROUND
bovicin hc <dig> is an antimicrobial peptide that shows a broad spectrum of activity and potential for biotechnological and therapeutic applications. to gain insight about the safety of bovicin hc <dig> application, the histological and immunostimulatory effects of orally administrated bovicin hc <dig> to balb/c mice were evaluated. balb/c mice were divided into three groups: negative control ; mice given purified bovicin hc <dig> ; mice given ovalbumin . the mice were initially pre-sensitized, and pbs, bovicin hc <dig> or ovalbumin were administered for 30 days by daily gavages. histological and morphometric analysis were performed and the relative expression of cytokines was analyzed by real-time rt-pcr.


RESULTS
the oral administration of bovicin hc <dig> to balb/c mice reduced weight gain and caused alterations in the small intestine, although absorptive changes have not been detected. the number of total goblet cells and the mucopolysaccharides production were not affected by bovicin hc <dig> administration. a hypertrophy of paneth cells and an increase in the number of mitotic cells were observed in bov group, while the number of mast cells remained unaltered. increased expression of tnf-α, inf-γ and il- <dig> was observed in the small intestine upon bovicin hc <dig> administration.


CONCLUSIONS
bovicin hc <dig> has only minor effects on intestinal permeability and did not elicit an allergenic response upon oral administration to animal models. considering the low in vivo toxicity of bovicin hc <dig>  it might be a good candidate for enteral applications.
