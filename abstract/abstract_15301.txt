BACKGROUND
early in mammalian brain development cell proliferation generates a population of progenitor cells whose subsequent divisions produce increasing numbers of postmitotic neurons. pax <dig> affects both processes and it has been suggested that this changing role is due at least in part to changes in the relative concentrations of its two main isoforms,  pax <dig> and  pax <dig>  created by insertion of a  <dig> bp exon  into one of the two dna-binding domains. crucially, however, no previous study has determined whether the ratio between pax <dig> and pax <dig> transcripts alters during mammalian neurogenesis in vivo.


RESULTS
using rnase protection assays, we show that pax <dig> transcripts are 6â€“ <dig> times more prevalent than pax <dig> transcripts early in neurogenesis in the murine telencephalon, diencephalon and hindbrain and that the ratio later falls significantly to about 3: <dig> in these regions.


CONCLUSIONS
these changes in vivo are similar in magnitude to those shown previously to alter target gene activity in vitro and might, therefore, allow the single mammalian pax <dig> gene to carry out different functions at different times in mammalian brain development.
