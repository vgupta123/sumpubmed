BACKGROUND
many pathogenic e. coli strains secrete virulence factors using type ii secretory systems, homologs of which are widespread in gram-negative bacteria. recently, the enteropathogenic escherichia coli strain e2348/ <dig> was shown to secrete and surface-anchor ssle, a biofilm-promoting virulence factor, via a type ii secretion system. genes encoding ssle and its associated secretion system are conserved in some non-pathogenic e. coli, including the commonly-used w  strain.


RESULTS
we report here that e. coli w uses its type ii secretion system to export a cognate ssle protein. ssle secretion is temperature- and nutrient-dependent, being robust at 37Â°c in rich medium but strongly repressed by lower temperatures or nutrient limitation. fusing either of two glycosyl hydrolases to the c-terminus of ssle prevented it from being secreted or surface-exposed. we screened mutations that inactivated the type ii secretion system for stress-related phenotypes and found that inactivation of the secretion system conferred a modest increase in tolerance to high concentrations of urea. additionally, we note that the genes encoding this secretion system are present at a hypervariable locus and have been independently lost or gained in different lineages of e. coli.


CONCLUSIONS
the non-pathogenic e. coli w strain shares the extracellular virulence factor ssle, and its associated secretory system, with pathogenic e. coli strains. the pattern of regulation of ssle secretion we observed suggests that ssle plays a role in colonization of mammalian hosts by non-pathogenic as well as pathogenic e. coli. our work provides a non-pathogenic model system for the study of ssle secretion, and informs future research into the function of ssle during host colonization.
