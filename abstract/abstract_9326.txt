BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  is a continuous threat to the pig industry, causing high economic losses worldwide. current vaccines have specific limitations in terms of their safety and efficacy, so the development of novel antiviral drugs is urgently required. the aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of the antimicrobial peptide cecropin p <dig>  against prrsv infection in vitro.


RESULTS
cp <dig> not only displayed extracellular virucidal activity against prrsv, but also exerted a potent inhibitory effect when added either before, simultaneously with, or after viral inoculation. the inhibitory effect of cp <dig> occurred during viral attachment, but not at viral entry into marc- <dig> cells. cp <dig> also inhibited viral particle release and attenuated virus-induced apoptosis during the late phase of infection. cp <dig> exerted similar inhibitory effects against prrsv infection in porcine alveolar macrophages, the cells targeted by the virus in vivo during its infection of pigs. the expression of interleukin  <dig> was elevated by cp <dig> in porcine alveolar macrophages, which might contribute to its inhibition of prrsv infection.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our findings provide a new direction for the development of potential therapeutic drugs against prrsv infection.
