BACKGROUND
the lactating mammary gland responds to changes in milking frequency by modulating milk production. this response is locally regulated and, in dairy cows, the udder is particularly sensitive during early lactation. relative to cows milked twice-daily throughout lactation, those milked four-times-daily for just the first 3 weeks of lactation produce more milk throughout that lactation. we hypothesized that the milk yield response would be associated with increased mammary cell turnover and changes in gene expression during frequent milking and persisting thereafter. cows were assigned to unilateral frequent milking  on days  <dig> to  <dig> of lactation, followed by twice-daily milking for the remainder of lactation. relative to udder halves milked twice-daily, those milked four-times produced more milk during ufm; the difference in milk yield declined acutely upon cessation of ufm after day  <dig>  but remained significantly elevated thereafter. we obtained mammary biopsies from both udder halves on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of lactation.


RESULTS
mammary cell proliferation and apoptosis were not affected by milking frequency. we identified  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed between paired udder halves on day  <dig> but exhibited a reversal of differential expression on day  <dig>  among those genes, we identified four clusters characterized by similar temporal patterns of differential expression. two clusters  were positively correlated with changes in milk yield and were differentially expressed on day  <dig> of lactation only, indicating involvement in the initial milk yield response. two other clusters  were negatively correlated with changes in milk yield. twenty-nine of the  <dig> genes were also differentially expressed on day  <dig> of lactation.


CONCLUSIONS
changes in milking frequency during early lactation did not alter mammary cell population dynamics, but were associated with coordinated changes in mammary expression of at least  <dig> genes. twenty-nine of those genes were differentially expressed 19 days after cessation of treatment, implicating them in the persistent milk yield response. we conclude that we have identified a novel transcriptional signature that may mediate the adaptive response to changes in milking frequency.
