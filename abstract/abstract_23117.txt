BACKGROUND
the duplication-degeneration-complementation  model has been proposed as an explanation for the unexpectedly high retention of duplicate genes. the hypothesis proposes that, following gene duplication, the two gene copies degenerate to perform complementary functions that jointly match that of the single ancestral gene, a process also known as subfunctionalization. we distinguish between subfunctionalization at the regulatory level and at the product level .


RESULTS
in contrast to what is expected under the ddc model, we use in silico modeling to show that regulatory subfunctionalization is expected to peak and then decrease significantly. at the same time, neofunctionalization  increases monotonically, eventually affecting the regulatory elements of the majority of genes. furthermore, since this process occurs under conditions of stabilizing selection, there is no need to invoke positive selection. at the product level, the frequency of subfunctionalization is no higher than would be expected by chance, a finding that was corroborated using yeast microarray time-course data. we also find that product subfunctionalization is not necessarily caused by regulatory subfunctionalization.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest a more complex picture of post-duplication evolution in which subfunctionalization plays only a partial role in conjunction with redundancy and neofunctionalization. we argue that this behavior is a consequence of the high evolutionary plasticity in gene networks.
