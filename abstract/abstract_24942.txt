BACKGROUND
by screening a plasmid library for proteins that could cause silencing when targeted to the hmr locus in saccharomyces cerevisiae, we previously reported the identification of rtt107/esc <dig> based on its ability to establish silent chromatin. in this study we aimed to determine the mechanism of rtt107/esc <dig> targeted silencing and also learn more about its biological functions.


RESULTS
targeted silencing by rtt107/esc <dig> was dependent on the sir genes, which encode obligatory structural and enzymatic components of yeast silent chromatin. based on its sequence, rtt107/esc <dig> was predicted to contain six brct motifs. this motif, originally identified in the human breast tumor suppressor gene brca <dig>  is a protein interaction domain. the targeted silencing activity of rtt107/esc <dig> resided within the c-terminal two brct motifs, and this region of the protein bound to sir <dig> in two-hybrid tests. deletion of rtt107/esc <dig> caused sensitivity to the dna damaging agent mms as well as to hydroxyurea. a two-hybrid screen showed that the n-terminal brct motifs of rtt107/esc <dig> bound to slx <dig>  a protein previously shown to be involved in dna repair and required for viability in a strain lacking the dna helicase sgs <dig>  like slx genes, rtt107esc <dig> interacted genetically with sgs1; esc4Δ sgs1Δ mutants were viable, but exhibited a slow-growth phenotype and also a synergistic dna repair defect.


CONCLUSIONS
rtt107/esc <dig> binds to the silencing protein sir <dig> and the dna repair protein slx <dig> via different brct motifs, thus providing a bridge linking silent chromatin to dna repair enzymes.
