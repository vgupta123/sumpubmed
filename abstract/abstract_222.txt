BACKGROUND
traditional fermented dairy products are major components of the typical mongolian diet since ancient times. however, almost all the previous studies on the microbial composition of traditional mongolian fermented dairy products analyzed food samples from the chinese mongolian region and mongolia but not the russian mongolian region. in this study, the bacterial and fungal community diversity of nineteen naturally fermented cow’s milk  samples from local mongolian families residing in kalmykia and chita of russia was investigated with pyrosequencing.


RESULTS
firmicutes and ascomycota were the predominant phyla respectively for bacteria and fungi. the abundance of the bacterial phylum acidobacteria was considerably different between the samples from the two regions. at genus level, lactobacillus and pichia were the predominating bacterial and fungal genera, respectively, while six bacterial genera significantly differed between the kalmykia  and chita  samples. the results of principal coordinate analysis  based on the bacterial or fungal composition of the kalmykia and chita samples revealed a different microbiota structure between the samples collected in these two locations. the redundancy analysis  identified  <dig> bacterial and  <dig> fungal otus as the key variables responsible for such microbiota structural difference.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that structural differences existed in the microbiota of nfcm between kalmykia and chita. the difference in geographic environment may be an important factor influencing the microbial diversity of nfcm made by the mongolians in russia.
