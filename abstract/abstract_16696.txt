BACKGROUND
sinorhizobium meliloti is a model system for the studies of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. an extensive polymorphism at the genetic and phenotypic level is present in natural populations of this species, especially in relation with symbiotic promotion of plant growth. ak <dig> and bl225c are two nodule-isolated strains with diverse symbiotic phenotypes; bl225c is more efficient in promoting growth of the medicago sativa plants than strain ak <dig>  in order to investigate the genetic determinants of the phenotypic diversification of s. meliloti strains ak <dig> and bl225c, we sequenced the complete genomes for these two strains.


RESULTS
with sizes of  <dig>  mbp and  <dig>  mbp, respectively, the genomes of ak <dig> and bl225c are larger than the laboratory strain rm <dig>  the core genome of rm <dig>  ak <dig>  bl225c strains included  <dig> orthologous groups, while the accessory genome was composed by  <dig> orthologous groups. while rm <dig> and bl225c have only three replicons , ak <dig> has also two plasmids,  <dig> and  <dig> kbp long. we found  <dig> interesting orthologous groups of genes that were present only in the accessory genome, consequently responsible for phenotypic diversity and putatively involved in plant-bacterium interaction. notably, the symbiosis inefficient ak <dig> lacked several genes required for microaerophilic growth inside nodules, while several genes for accessory functions related to competition, plant invasion and bacteroid tropism were identified only in ak <dig> and bl225c strains. presence and extent of polymorphism in regulons of transcription factors involved in symbiotic interaction were also analyzed. our results indicate that regulons are flexible, with a large number of accessory genes, suggesting that regulons polymorphism could also be a key determinant in the variability of symbiotic performances among the analyzed strains.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusions, the extended comparative genomics approach revealed a variable subset of genes and regulons that may contribute to the symbiotic diversity.
