BACKGROUND
alkyl hydroperoxidase activity provides an important antioxidant defense for bacterial cells. the catalytic mechanism requires two peroxidases, ahpc and ahpd, where ahpd plays the role of an essential adaptor protein.


RESULTS
the crystal structure of a putative ahpd from pseudomonas aeruginosa has been determined at  <dig>  Å. the protein has an all-helical fold with a chain topology similar to a known ahpd from mycobacterium tuberculosis despite a low overall sequence identity of 9%. a conserved two α-helical motif responsible for function is present in both. however, in the p. aeruginosa protein, helices h <dig>  h <dig> of this motif are located at the n-terminal part of the chain, while in m. tuberculosis ahpd, the corresponding helices h <dig>  h <dig> are situated at the c-terminus. residues 24- <dig> of the putative catalytic region of p. aeruginosa have a higher sequence identity of 33% where the functional activity is supplied by a proton relay system of five residues, glu <dig>  cys <dig>  tyr <dig>  cys <dig>  and his <dig>  and one structural water molecule. a comparison of five other related hypothetical proteins from various species, assigned to the alkyl hydroperoxidase d-like protein family, shows they contain the same conserved structural motif and catalytic sequence cys-x-x-cys. we have shown that ahpd from p. aeruginosa exhibits a weak ability to reduce h2o <dig> as tested using a ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange  assay, and this activity is blocked by thiol alkylating reagents.


CONCLUSIONS
thus, this hypothetical protein was assigned to the ahpd-like protein family with peroxidase-related activity. the functional relationship of specific oligomeric structures of ahpd-like structural family is discussed.
