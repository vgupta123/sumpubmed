BACKGROUND
variation within individual genomes ranges from single nucleotide polymorphisms  to kilobase, and even megabase, sized structural variants , such as deletions, insertions, inversions, and more complex rearrangements. although much is known about the extent of svs in humans and mice, species in which they exert significant effects on phenotypes, very little is known about the extent of svs in the  <dig> -times smaller and less repetitive genome of the chicken.


RESULTS
we identified hundreds of shared and divergent svs in four commercial chicken lines relative to the reference chicken genome. the majority of svs were found in intronic and intergenic regions, and we also found svs in the coding regions. to identify the svs, we combined high-throughput short read paired-end sequencing of genomic reduced representation libraries  of pooled samples from  <dig> individuals and computational mapping of dna sequences from a reference genome.


CONCLUSIONS
we provide a first glimpse of the high abundance of small structural genomic variations in the chicken. extrapolating our results, we estimate that there are thousands of rearrangements in the chicken genome, the majority of which are located in non-coding regions. we observed that structural variation contributes to genetic differentiation among current domesticated chicken breeds and the red jungle fowl. we expect that, because of their high abundance, svs might explain phenotypic differences and play a role in the evolution of the chicken genome. finally, our study exemplifies an efficient and cost-effective approach for identifying structural variation in sequenced genomes.
