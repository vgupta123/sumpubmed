BACKGROUND
debaryomyces hansenii is one of the most salt tolerant species of yeast and has become a model organism for the study of tolerance mechanisms against salinity. the goal of this study was to identify key upregulated genes that are involved in its adaptation to high salinity.


RESULTS
by using forward subtractive hybridization we have cloned and sequenced dhahp from d. hansenii that is significantly upregulated during salinity stress. dhahp is orthologous to the alkly hydroperoxide reductase of the peroxiredoxin gene family, which catalyzes the reduction of peroxides at the expense of thiol compounds. the full-lengthed cdna of dhahp has  <dig> bp of nucleotide and contains a  <dig> bp open reading frame  encoding a deduced protein of  <dig> amino acid residues . d. hansenii ahp is a cytosolic protein that belongs to the ahp of the 1-cys type peroxiredoxins. phylogentically, the dhahp and candida albicans ahp <dig>  share a common ancestry but show divergent evolution. silence of its expression in d. hansenii by rnai resulted in decreased tolerance to salt whereas overexpression of dhahp in d. hansenii and the salt-sensitive yeasts saccharomyces cereviasiae and pichia methanolica conferred a higher tolerance with a reduced level of reactive oxygen species.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, for the first time our study has identified alkly hydroperoxide reductase as a key protein involved in the salt tolerance of the extremely halophilic d. hansenii. apparently, this enzyme plays a multi-functional role in the yeast's adaptation to salinity; it serves as a peroxidase in scavenging reactive oxygen species, as a molecular chaperone in protecting essential proteins from denaturation, and as a redox sensor in regulating h2o2-mediated cell defense signaling.
