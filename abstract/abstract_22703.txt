BACKGROUND
automated extraction systems have become a time saving necessity in systems biology. considerable human effort is needed to model, analyse and simulate biological networks. thus, one of the challenges posed to biomedical text mining tools is that of learning to recognise a wide variety of biological concepts with different functional roles to assist in these processes.


RESULTS
here, we present a novel corpus concerning the integrated cellular responses to nutrient starvation in the model-organism escherichia coli. our corpus is a unique resource in that it annotates biomedical concepts that play a functional role in expression, regulation and metabolism. namely, it includes annotations for genetic information carriers , proteins , small metabolites, physiological states and laboratory techniques. the corpus consists of  <dig> full-text papers with a total of  <dig> annotations for  <dig> different biomedical concepts; the two dominant classes are genes  and compounds , whereas other important cellular concepts such as proteins account for no more than 10% of the annotated concepts.


CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge, a corpus that details such a wide range of biological concepts has never been presented to the text mining community. the inter-annotator agreement statistics provide evidence of the importance of a consolidated background when dealing with such complex descriptions, the ambiguities naturally arising from the terminology and their impact for modelling purposes.

availability is granted for the full-text corpora of  <dig> freely accessible documents, the annotation scheme and the annotation guidelines. also, we include a corpus of  <dig> abstracts.
