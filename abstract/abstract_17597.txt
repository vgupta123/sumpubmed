BACKGROUND
the objective of this research was to investigate the variation of gene expression in the blood transcriptome profile of chinese holstein cows associated to the milk yield traits.


RESULTS
we used rna-seq to generate the bovine transcriptome from the blood of  <dig> lactating chinese holstein cows with extremely high and low milk yield. a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes   were revealed between the high and low groups. gene ontology  analysis demonstrated that the  <dig> degs were enriched in specific biological processes with regard to defense response, immune response, inflammatory response, icosanoid metabolic process, and fatty acid metabolic process . the kegg pathway analysis with  <dig> degs revealed that the most statistically-significant metabolic pathway was related with toll-like receptor signaling pathway . the expression level of four selected degs was analyzed by qrt-pcr, and the results indicated that the expression patterns were consistent with the deep sequencing results by rna-seq. furthermore, alternative splicing analysis of  <dig> degs demonstrated that there were different splicing pattern between high and low yielders. the alternative 3’ splicing site was the major splicing pattern detected in high yielders. however, in low yielders the major type was exon skipping.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a non-invasive method to identify the degs in cattle blood using rna-seq for milk yield. the revealed  <dig> degs between holstein cows with extremely high and low milk yield, and immunological pathway are likely involved in milk yield trait. finally, this study allowed us to explore associations between immune traits and production traits related to milk production.
