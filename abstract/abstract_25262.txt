BACKGROUND
nontypeable haemophilus influenzae colonizes and infects the airways of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the fourth most common cause of death worldwide.thus, h. influenzae, an exclusively human pathogen, has adapted to survive in the hostile environment of the human airways.to characterize proteins expressed by h. influenzae in the airways, a prototype strain was grown in pooled human sputum to simulate conditions in the human respiratory tract.the proteins from whole bacterial cell lysates were solubilized with a strong buffer and then quantitatively cleaned with an optimized precipitation/on-pellet enzymatic digestion procedure.proteomic profiling was accomplished by nano-flow liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy with low void volume and high separation efficiency with a shallow, long gradient.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> proteins were identified with high confidence, including  <dig> proteins that were encoded by genes that are annotated as conserved hypothetical proteins.thirty-one proteins were present in greater abundance in sputum-grown conditions at a ratio of >  <dig>  compared to chemically defined media.these included  <dig> anti-oxidant and  <dig> stress-related proteins, suggesting that expression of antioxidant activity and stress responses is important for survival in the airways.four proteins involved in uptake of divalent anions and  <dig> proteins that function in uptake of various molecules were present in greater abundance in sputum-grown conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
proteomic expression profiling of h. influenzae grown in pooled human sputum revealed increased expression of antioxidant, stress-response proteins and cofactor and nutrient uptake systems compared to media grown cells.these observations suggest that h. influenzae adapts to the oxidative and nutritionally limited conditions of the airways in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by increasing expression of molecules necessary for survival in these conditions.
