BACKGROUND
the tomato kinase pto confers resistance to bacterial speck disease caused by pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato in a gene for gene manner. upon recognition of specific avirulence factors the pto kinase activates multiple signal transduction pathways culminating in induction of pathogen defense. the soluble cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase pti <dig> is one target of pto phosphorylation and is involved in the hypersensitive response  reaction. however, a clear role of pti <dig> in plant pathogen resistance is uncertain. so far, no pti <dig> homologues from monocotyledonous species have been studied.


RESULTS
here we report the identification and molecular analysis of four pti1-like kinases from maize . these kinase genes showed tissue-specific expression and their corresponding proteins were targeted to different cellular compartments. sequence similarity, expression pattern and cellular localization of zmpti1b suggested that this gene is a putative orthologue of pti <dig> from tomato. in contrast, zmpti1a was specifically expressed in pollen and sequestered to the plasma membrane, evidently owing to n-terminal modification by myristoylation and/or s-acylation. the zmpti1a:gfp fusion protein was not evenly distributed at the pollen plasma membrane but accumulated as an annulus-like structure which co-localized with callose  deposition. in addition, co-localization of zmpti1a and callose was observed during stages of pollen mitosis i and pollen tube germination. maize plants in which zmpti1a expression was silenced by rna interference  produced pollen with decreased competitive ability. hence, our data provide evidence that zmpti1a plays an important part in a signalling pathway that accelerates pollen performance and male fitness.


CONCLUSIONS
zmpti1a from maize is involved in pollen-specific processes during the progamic phase of reproduction, probably in crucial signalling processes associated with regions of callose deposition. pollen-sporophyte interactions and pathogen induced hr show certain similarities. for example, hr has been shown to be associated with cell wall reinforcement through callose deposition. hence, it is hypothesized that pti <dig> kinases from maize act as general components in evolutionary conserved signalling processes associated with callose, however during different developmental programs and in different tissue types.
