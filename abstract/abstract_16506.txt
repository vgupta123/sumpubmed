BACKGROUND
circadian rhythms have a profound effect on human health. their disruption can lead to serious pathologies, such as cancer and obesity. gene expression studies in these pathologies are often studied in different mouse strains by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction . selection of reference genes is a crucial step of qpcr experiments. recent studies show that reference gene stability can vary between species and tissues, but none has taken circadian experiments into consideration.


RESULTS
in the present study the expression of ten candidate reference genes  was measured in  <dig> liver and  <dig> adrenal gland samples taken from three mouse strains  every  <dig> h in a  <dig> h period. expression stability was evaluated by genorm and normfinder programs. differences in ranking of the most stable reference genes were observed both between individual mouse strains as well as between tissues within each mouse strain. we show that selection of reference gene  that is often used for analyses in individual mouse strains leads to errors if used for normalization when different mouse strains are compared. we identified alternative reference genes that are stable in these comparisons.


CONCLUSIONS
genetic background and circadian time influence the expression stability of reference genes. differences between mouse strains and tissues should be taken into consideration to avoid false interpretations. we show that the use of a single reference gene can lead to false biological conclusions. this manuscript provides a useful reference point for researchers that search for stable reference genes in the field of circadian biology.
