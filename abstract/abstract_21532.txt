BACKGROUND
the mosquito, armigeres subalbatus, mounts a distinctively robust innate immune response when infected with the nematode brugia malayi, a causative agent of lymphatic filariasis. in order to mine the transcriptome for new insight into the cascade of events that takes place in response to infection in this mosquito,  <dig> cdna libraries were generated from tissues of adult female mosquitoes subjected to immune-response activation treatments that lead to well-characterized responses, and from aging, na√Øve mosquitoes. expressed sequence tags  from each library were produced, annotated, and subjected to comparative analyses.


RESULTS
six libraries were constructed and used to generate  <dig>  expressed sequence tags, of which  <dig>  passed quality filters to be included in the annotation project and subsequent analyses. all of these sequences were collapsed into clusters resulting in  <dig>  unique sequence clusters or singletons. est clusters were annotated and curated manually within asap  web portal according to blast results from comparisons to genbank, and the anopheles gambiae and drosophila melanogaster genome projects.


CONCLUSIONS
the resulting dataset is the first of its kind for this mosquito vector and provides a basis for future studies of mosquito vectors regarding the cascade of events that occurs in response to infection, and thereby providing insight into vector competence and innate immunity.
