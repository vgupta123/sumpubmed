BACKGROUND
prediction of protein solvent accessibility, also called accessible surface area  prediction, is an important step for tertiary structure prediction directly from one-dimensional sequences. traditionally, predicting solvent accessibility is regarded as either a two-  or three-state  classification problem. however, the states of solvent accessibility are not well-defined in real protein structures. thus, a number of methods have been developed to directly predict the real value asa based on evolutionary information such as position specific scoring matrix .


RESULTS
this study enhances the pssm-based features for real value asa prediction by considering the physicochemical properties and solvent propensities of amino acid types. we propose a systematic method for identifying residue groups with respect to protein solvent accessibility. the amino acid columns in the pssm profile that belong to a certain residue group are merged to generate novel features. finally, support vector regression  is adopted to construct a real value asa predictor. experimental results demonstrate that the features produced by the proposed selection process are informative for asa prediction.


CONCLUSIONS
experimental results based on a widely used benchmark reveal that the proposed method performs best among several of existing packages for performing asa prediction. furthermore, the feature selection mechanism incorporated in this study can be applied to other regression problems using the pssm. the program and data are available from the authors upon request.
