BACKGROUND
allosteric coupling, which can be defined as propagation of a perturbation at one region of the protein molecule  to distant sites in the same molecule, constitutes the most general mechanism of regulation of protein function. however, unlike molecular details of ligand binding, structural elements involved in allosteric effects are difficult to diagnose. here, we identified allosteric linkages in the α-subunits of heterotrimeric g proteins, which were evolved to transmit membrane receptor signals by allosteric mechanisms, by using two different approaches that utilize fundamentally different and independent information.


RESULTS
we analyzed: 1) correlated mutations in the family of g protein α-subunits, and 2) cooperativity of the native state ensemble of the gαi <dig> or transducin. the combination of these approaches not only recovered already-known details such as the switch regions that change conformation upon nucleotide exchange, and those regions that are involved in receptor, effector or gβγ interactions , but also predicted new sites that are potentially involved in allosteric communication in the gα protein. a summary of the new sites found in the present analysis, which were not apparent in crystallographic data, is given along with known functional and structural information. implications of the results are discussed.


CONCLUSIONS
a set of residues and/or structural elements that are potentially involved in allosteric communication in gα is presented. this information can be used as a guide to structural, spectroscopic, mutational, and theoretical studies on the allosteric network in gα proteins, which will provide a better understanding of g protein-mediated signal transduction.
