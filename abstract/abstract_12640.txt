BACKGROUND
systems approaches to studying drug-side-effect  associations are emerging as an active research area for both drug target discovery and drug repositioning. however, a comprehensive drug-se association knowledge base does not exist. in this study, we present a novel knowledge-driven  approach to effectively extract a large number of drug-se pairs from published biomedical literature.

data and methods
for the text corpus, we used  <dig> , <dig> medline records . first, we used known drug-se associations derived from fda drug labels as prior knowledge to automatically find se-related sentences and abstracts. we then extracted a total of  <dig>  drug-se pairs from medline sentences and  <dig>  pairs from abstracts.


RESULTS
on average, the kd approach has achieved a precision of  <dig> , a recall of  <dig> , and an f <dig> of  <dig> , which is significantly better than a svm-based machine learning approach  with a  <dig> % increase in f <dig> score. through integrative analysis, we demonstrate that the higher-level phenotypic drug-se relationships reflects lower-level genetic, genomic, and chemical drug mechanisms. in addition, we show that the extracted drug-se pairs can be directly used in drug repositioning.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we automatically constructed a large-scale higher-level drug phenotype relationship knowledge, which can have great potential in computational drug discovery.
