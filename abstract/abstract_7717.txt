BACKGROUND
studies of mycobacterium bovis bcg strains used in different countries and vaccination programs show clear variations in the genomes and immune protective properties of bcg strains. the aim of this study was to characterise the genomic and immune proteomic profile of the bcg  <dig> strain used in mexico.


RESULTS
bcg mexico  <dig> has a circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> bp with a g+c content and numbers of genes and pseudogenes similar to those of bcg tokyo and bcg pasteur. bcg mexico  <dig> lacks region of difference  <dig> , rd <dig> and n-rd <dig> and one copy of is <dig>  indicating that bcg mexico  <dig> belongs to du <dig> group iv within the bcg vaccine genealogy. in addition, this strain contains three new rds, which are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp  long, and  <dig> single-nucleotide polymorphisms representing non-synonymous mutations compared to bcg pasteur and bcg tokyo. in a comparative proteomic analysis, the bcg mexico  <dig>  danish, phipps and tokyo strains showed  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> protein spots, respectively. the same analysis showed that bcg mexico  <dig> shares 62% of its protein spots with the bcg danish strain, 61% with the bcg phipps strain and only 48% with the bcg tokyo strain. thirty-nine reactive spots were detected in bcg mexico  <dig> using sera from subjects with active tuberculosis infections and positive tuberculin skin tests.


CONCLUSIONS
bcg mexico  <dig> has a smaller genome than the bcg pasteur and bcg tokyo strains. two specific deletions in bcg mexico  <dig> are described . the loss of rdmex <dig>  is associated with enhanced macrophage binding and rdmex <dig> contains genes that may be involved in regulatory pathways. we also describe new antigenic proteins for the first time.
