BACKGROUND
production of a variety of finger-key touches in the piano is essential for expressive musical performance. however, it remains unknown how expert pianists control multi-joint finger and arm movements for manipulating the touch. the present study investigated differences in kinematics and kinetics of the upper-limb movements while expert pianists were depressing a key with two different touches: pressed and struck. the former starts key-depression with the finger-tip contacting the key, whereas the latter involves preparatory arm-lift before striking the key. to determine the effect of individual muscular torque  as well as non-muscular torques on joint acceleration, we performed a series of inverse and forward dynamics computations.


RESULTS
the pressed touch showed smaller elbow extension velocity, and larger shoulder and finger flexion velocities during key-depression compared with the struck touch. the former touch also showed smaller elbow extension acceleration directly attributed to the shoulder mus. in contrast, the shoulder flexion acceleration induced by elbow and wrist mus was greater for the pressed touch than the struck touch. towards the goal of producing the target finger-key contact dynamics, the pressed and struck touches effectively took advantage of the distal-to-proximal and proximal-to-distal inter-segmental dynamics, respectively. furthermore, a psychoacoustic experiment confirmed that a tone elicited by the pressed touch was perceived softer than that by the struck touch.


CONCLUSIONS
the present findings suggest that manipulation of tone timbre depends on control of inter-segmental dynamics in piano keystroke.
