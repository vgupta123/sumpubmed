BACKGROUND
the pig, sus scrofa domestica includes both the miniature and commercial domestic breed. these animals have influenced the human life and economies and have been studied throughout history. although the miniature breeds are more recent and have increasingly been used in a variety of biomedical studies, their cell lines have rarely been established. therefore, we sought to establish primary and immortal cell lines derived from both the miniature and domestic pig to better enable insight into possible in vivo growth differences.


RESULTS
the in vitro lifespan of primary domestic pig fibroblast  and miniature pig fibroblast  cells using a standard 3t <dig> protocol was determined. both of the primary pf and mpf cells were shown to have a two-step replicative senescence barrier. primary mpf cells exhibited a relatively shorter lifespan and slower proliferation rate compared to those of primary pf cells. beyond senescence barriers, lifespan-extended pf and mpf cells were eventually established and indicated spontaneous cellular immortalization. in contrast to the immortalized pf cells, immortal mpf cells showed a transformed phenotype and possessed more frequent chromosomal abnormalities and loss of p <dig> regulatory function. the lifespan of primary mpf and pf cells was extended by inactivation of the p <dig> function using transduction by sv40lt without any detectable senescent phenotype.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that p <dig> signaling might be a major determinant for the replicative senescence in the mpf cells that have the shorter lifespan and slower growth rate compared to pf cells in vitro.
