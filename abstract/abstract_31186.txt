BACKGROUND
maintaining proper adhesion between neighboring cells depends on the ability of cells to mechanically respond to tension at cell-cell junctions through the actin cytoskeleton. thus, identifying the molecules involved in responding to cell tension would provide insight into the maintenance, regulation, and breakdown of cell-cell junctions during various biological processes. vinculin, an actin-binding protein that associates with the cadherin complex, is recruited to cell-cell contacts under increased tension in a myosin ii-dependent manner. however, the precise role of vinculin at force-bearing cell-cell junctions and how myosin ii activity alters the recruitment of vinculin at quiescent cell-cell contacts have not been demonstrated.


RESULTS
we generated vinculin knockdown cells using shrna specific to vinculin and mdck epithelial cells. these vinculin-deficient mdck cells form smaller cell clusters in a suspension than wild-type cells. in wound healing assays, gfp-vinculin accumulated at cell-cell junctions along the wound edge while vinculin-deficient cells displayed a slower wound closure rate compared to vinculin-expressing cells. in the presence of blebbistatin , vinculin localization at quiescent cell-cell contacts was unaffected while in the presence of jasplakinolide , vinculin recruitment increased in mature mdck cell monolayers.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate that vinculin plays an active role at adherens junctions under increased tension at cell-cell contacts where vinculin recruitment occurs in a myosin ii activity-dependent manner, whereas vinculin recruitment to the quiescent cell-cell junctions depends on f-actin stabilization.
