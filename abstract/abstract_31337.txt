BACKGROUND
in cancer cells the three-dimensional  telomere organization of interphase nuclei into a telomeric disk is heavily distorted and aggregates are found. in hodgkin's lymphoma quantitative fish  reveals a major impact of nuclear telomere dynamics during the transition form mononuclear hodgkin  to diagnostic multinuclear reed-sternberg  cells. in vitro and in vivo formation of rs-cells is associated with the increase of very short telomeres including "t-stumps", telomere loss, telomeric aggregate formation and the generation of "ghost nuclei".


RESULTS
here we analyze the 3d telomere dynamics by q-fish in the novel hodgkin cell line u-ho <dig> and its non-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase n <dig>  stable transfectant u-ho1-ptpn <dig>  derived from a primary refractory hodgkin's lymphoma. both cell lines show equally high telomerase activity but u-ho1-ptpn differs from u-ho <dig> by a three times longer doubling time, low stat5a expression, accumulation of rs-cells  and a fourfold increased number of apoptotic cells.

as expected, multinuclear u-ho1-rs-cells and multinuclear u-ho1-ptpn1-rs-cells differ from their mononuclear h-precursors by their nuclear volume , the number of telomeres  and the increase in telomere aggregates . surprisingly, u-ho1-rs cells differ from u-ho1-ptpn1-rs-cells by a highly significant increase of very short telomeres including "t-stumps" .


CONCLUSIONS
abundant rs-cells without additional very short telomeres including "t-stumps", high rate of apoptosis, but low stat5a expression, are hallmarks of the u-ho1-ptpn <dig> cell line. these characteristics are independent of telomerase activity. thus, ptpn <dig> induced dephosphorylation of stat <dig> with consecutive lack of akt/pkb activation and cellular arrest in g <dig>  promoting induction of apoptosis, appears as a possible pathogenetic mechanism deserving further experimental investigation.
