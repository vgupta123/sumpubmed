BACKGROUND
using whole exome sequencing to predict aberrations in tumours is a cost effective alternative to whole genome sequencing, however is predominantly used for variant detection and infrequently utilised for detection of somatic copy number variation.


RESULTS
we propose a new method to infer copy number and genotypes using whole exome data from paired tumour/normal samples. our algorithm uses two hidden markov models to predict copy number and genotypes and computationally resolves polyploidy/aneuploidy, normal cell contamination and signal baseline shift. our method makes explicit detection on chromosome arm level events, which are commonly found in tumour samples. the methods are combined into a package named adtex . we applied our algorithm to a cohort of  <dig> in-house generated and  <dig> tcga paired ovarian cancer/normal exomes and evaluated the performance by comparing against the copy number variations and genotypes predicted using affymetrix snp  <dig>  data of the same samples. further, we carried out a comparison study to show that adtex outperformed its competitors in terms of precision and f-measure.


CONCLUSIONS
our proposed method, adtex, uses both depth of coverage ratios and b allele frequencies calculated from whole exome sequencing data, to predict copy number variations along with their genotypes. adtex is implemented as a user friendly software package using python and r statistical language. source code and sample data are freely available under gnu license  at http://adtex.sourceforge.net/.
