BACKGROUND
this study describes how the complete mitogenome of a terrestrial snail, cylindrus obtusus  was sequenced without pcrs from a collection specimen that had been in 70% ethanol for  <dig> years. the mitogenome was obtained with illumina gaiix shot gun sequencing. although the used specimen was collected relatively recently and kept in a dna-friendly preservative , we believe that the exclusion of pcrs as facilitated by ngs  removes a great obstacle in dna sequencing of collection specimens. a brief comparison is made between our illumina gaiix approach and a similar study that made use of the roche 454-flx platform.


RESULTS
the mtdna sequence of c. obtusus is  <dig>  bases in length  and contains the  <dig> genes  typical for metazoans. except for a swap between the position of trna-pro and trna-ala, the gene arrangement of c. obtusus is identical to that reported for cepaea nemoralis. the 'aberrant' rearrangement of trna-thr and coiii compared to that of other sigmurethra , is not unique for c. nemoralis , but is also shown to occur in c. obtusus  and might be a synapomorphy for the family helicidae.


CONCLUSIONS
natural history collections potentially harbor a wealth of information for the field of evolutionary genetics, but it can be difficult to amplify dna from such specimens . because ngs techniques do not rely on primer-directed amplification  and allow dna to be fragmented , ngs could be a valuable tool for retrieving dna sequence data from such specimens. a comparison between illumina gaiix and the roche  <dig> platform suggests that the former might be more suited for de novo sequencing of mitogenomes.
