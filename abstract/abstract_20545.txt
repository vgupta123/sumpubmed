BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile is the leading cause of hospital-borne infections occurring when the natural intestinal flora is depleted following antibiotic treatment. current treatments for clostridium difficile infections present high relapse rates and new hyper-virulent and multi-resistant strains are emerging, making the study of this nosocomial pathogen necessary to find novel therapeutic targets.


RESULTS
we present imltc806cdf, an extensively curated reconstructed metabolic network for the c. difficile pathogenic strain  <dig>  imltc806cdf contains  <dig> genes,  <dig> metabolites and  <dig> metabolic,  <dig> exchange and  <dig> transport reactions. imltc806cdf is the most complete and accurate metabolic reconstruction of a gram-positive anaerobic bacteria to date. we validate the model with simulated growth assays in different media and carbon sources and use it to predict essential genes. we obtain  <dig> % accuracy in the prediction of gene essentiality when compared to experimental data for b. subtilis homologs . we predict the existence of  <dig> essential genes and  <dig> essential gene pairs, a number of which are unique to c. difficile and have non-existing or predicted non-essential human homologs. for  <dig> of these potential therapeutic targets, we find  <dig> inhibitors of homologous proteins including approved drugs with the potential for drug repositioning, that when validated experimentally could serve as starting points in the development of new antibiotics.


CONCLUSIONS
we created a highly curated metabolic network model of c. difficile strain  <dig> and used it to predict essential genes as potential new therapeutic targets in the fight against clostridium difficile infections.
