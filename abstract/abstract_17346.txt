BACKGROUND
the bovine rumen hosts a diverse and complex community of eukarya, bacteria, archea and viruses . the rumen viral population  has received little attention compared to the rumen microbial population . we used massively parallel sequencing of virus like particles to investigate the diversity of the rumen virome in thirteen lactating australian holstein dairy cattle all housed in the same location,  <dig> of which were sampled on the same day.


RESULTS
fourteen putative viral sequence fragments over  <dig> kbp in length were assembled and annotated. many of the putative genes in the assembled contigs showed no homology to previously annotated genes, highlighting the large amount of work still required to fully annotate the functions encoded in viral genomes. the abundance of the contig sequences varied widely between animals, even though the cattle were of the same age, stage of lactation and fed the same diets. additionally the twelve animals which were co-habited shared a number of their dominant viral contigs. we compared the functional characteristics of our bovine viromes with that of other viromes, as well as rumen microbiomes. at the functional level, we found strong similarities between all of the viral samples, which were highly distinct from the rumen microbiome samples.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest a large amount of between animal variation in the bovine rumen virome and that co-habiting animals may have more similar viromes than non co-habited animals. we report the deepest sequencing to date of the rumen virome. this work highlights the enormous amount of novelty and variation present in the rumen virome.
