BACKGROUND
mammary tumours frequently develop in female domestic cats being highly malignant in a large percentage of cases. chemokines regulate many physiological and pathological processes including organogenesis, chemotaxis of inflammatory cells, as well as tumour progression and metastasization. in particular, the chemokine/receptor pair sdf-1/cxcr <dig> has been involved in the regulation of metastatic potential of neoplastic cells, including breast cancer. the aim of this study was the immunohistochemical defininition of the expression profile of cxcr <dig> in primary and metastatic feline mammary carcinomas and the evaluation of the role of sdf- <dig> in feline mammary tumour cell proliferation.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> mammary surgical samples, including  <dig> primary tumours ,  <dig> metastases, and  <dig> normal mammary tissues were anlyzed. tumor samples were collected from a total number of  <dig> animals, as in some cases concurrent occurrence of neoplasm in more than one mammary gland was observed. tissues were processed for standard histological examination, and all lesions were classified according to the world health organization criteria. cxcr <dig> expression in neoplastic cells was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. the level of cxcr <dig> immunoreactivity was semi-quantitatively estimated as cxcr <dig> score evaluating both the number of positive cells and the intensity of staining. six primary, fibroblast-free primary cultures were obtained from fresh feline mammary carcinomas and characterized by immunofluorescence for cxcr <dig> and malignant mammary cell marker expression. sdf-1-dependent in vitro proliferative effects were also assayed. cxcr <dig> expression was observed in  <dig> out of  <dig> malignant tissues with a higher cxcr <dig> score observed in  <dig> out of  <dig> metastatic lesions than in the respective primary tumours. in  <dig> benign lesions analyzed, only the single basaloid adenoma showed a mild positive immunostaining against cxcr <dig>  normal tissue did not show cxcr <dig> immunoreactivity. cxcr <dig> score was statistically significantly associated with the histological features of the samples, showing an increase accordingly with the degree of neoplastic transformation . finally, in the primary cultures obtained from  <dig> primary feline mammary carcinomas cxcr <dig> expression was detected in all cells and its activation by sdf- <dig> in vitro treatment caused a significant increase in the proliferation rate in  <dig> out of  <dig> tumours.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that malignant feline mammary tumours commonly express cxcr <dig>  with a higher level in malignant tumours, and, in most of the cases analysed, metastatic cells display stronger immunoreactivity for cxcr <dig> than the corresponding primary tumours. moreover, cxcr <dig> activation in primary cultures of feline mammary carcinomas causes increase in the proliferative rate. thus, sdf-1/cxcr <dig> system seems to play a tumorigenic in feline mammary gland malignancy and in vitro cultures from these tumour samples may represent an experimental model to investigate the biological and pharmacological role of this chemokinergic axis.
