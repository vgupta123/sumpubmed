BACKGROUND
myf <dig> is one member of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors, and it functions as a myogenic factor that is important for the specification and differentiation of muscle cells. the expression of myf <dig> is somite- and stage-dependent during embryogenesis through a delicate regulation. however, this complex regulatory mechanism of myf <dig> is not clearly understood.


RESULTS
we isolated a 156-kb bacterial artificial chromosome clone that includes an upstream 80-kb region and a downstream 70-kb region of zebrafish myf <dig> and generated a transgenic line carrying this 156-kb segment fused to a green fluorescent protein  reporter gene. we find strong gfp expression in the most rostral somite and in the presomitic mesoderm during segmentation stages, similar to endogenous myf <dig> expression. later, the gfp signals persist in caudal somites near the tail bud but are down-regulated in the older, rostral somites. during the pharyngula period, we detect gfp signals in pectoral fin buds, dorsal rostral myotomes, hypaxial myotomes, and inferior oblique and superior oblique muscles, a pattern that also corresponds well with endogenous myf <dig> transcripts. to characterize the specific upstream cis-elements that regulate this complex and dynamic expression pattern, we also generated several transgenic lines that harbor various lengths within the upstream 80-kb segment. we find that  the - <dig> kb/- <dig> segment contains a fin and cranial muscle element and a notochord repressor;  the -9977/- <dig> segment contains a strong repressive element that does not include the notochord-specific repressor;  the -6212/- <dig> segment contains tissue-specific elements for bone and spinal cord;  the -2937/- <dig> segment contains an eye enhancer, and the -2937/- <dig> segment is required for notochord and myocyte expression; and  the -290/- <dig> segment is responsible for basal transcription in somites and the presomitic mesoderm.


CONCLUSIONS
we suggest that the cell lineage-specific expression of myf <dig> is delicately orchestrated by multiple modules within the distal upstream region. this study provides an insight to understand the molecular control of myf <dig> and myogenesis in the zebrafish.
