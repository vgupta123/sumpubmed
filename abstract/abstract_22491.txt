BACKGROUND
huntington disease  is an adult onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin  protein. htt function is essential for embryonic survival as well as normal function during the postnatal period. in addition to having roles in transcription and transport, recent evidence demonstrates that wild-type htt is neuroprotective in vivo. to determine whether treatment with wild-type htt would be beneficial in hd, we crossed the yac <dig> mouse model of hd with mice that over-express wild-type htt  to generate yac <dig> mice that over-express wild-type htt .


RESULTS
yac18/ <dig> mice were found to express mutant htt at the same level as yac <dig> mice and wild-type htt at the same level as yac <dig> mice. yac18/ <dig> mice show no significant behavioural improvement compared to yac <dig> mice in the rotarod test of motor coordination or in an automated open field test. in the brain, yac18/ <dig> mice show no significant improvement in striatal volume, striatal neuronal numbers or striatal darpp- <dig> expression compared to yac <dig> mice. in contrast, striatal neuronal cross-sectional area showed significant improvement in yac18/ <dig> mice compared to yac <dig> mice.


CONCLUSIONS
while the over-expression of wild-type htt results in a mild improvement in striatal neuropathology in yac <dig> mice, our findings suggest that treatment with wild-type htt may not be sufficient to ameliorate the symptoms of hd in this model.
