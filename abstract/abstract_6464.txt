BACKGROUND
one of the major obstacles in the design of an effective vaccine against hiv- <dig> is the hypervariability of the hiv- <dig> envelope glycoprotein. most hiv- <dig> vaccine candidates have utilized envelope glycoprotein from a single virus isolate, but to date, none of them elicited broadly reactive humoral immunity. herein, we hypothesised that a cocktail of hiv- <dig> gp <dig> proteins containing multiple epitopes may increase the breadth of immune responses against hiv- <dig>  we compared and evaluated the immunogenicity of hiv- <dig> vaccines containing either gp <dig> protein alone or in combinations of four or fourteen gp120s from different primary hiv- <dig> isolates in immunized hamsters.


RESULTS
we amplified and characterized  <dig> different gp120s from primary subtype b isolates with both syncytium and non-syncytium inducing properties, and expressed the proteins in chinese hamster ovary  cell lines. purified proteins were used either alone or in combinations of four or fourteen different gp120s to vaccinate golden hamsters. the polyvalent vaccine showed higher antibody titers to hiv- <dig> subtype b isolates mn and sf <dig> compared to the groups that received one or four gp <dig> proteins. however, the polyvalent vaccine was not able to show higher neutralizing antibody responses against hiv- <dig> primary isolates. interestingly, the polyvalent vaccine group had the highest proliferative immune responses and showed a substantial proportion of cross-subtype cd <dig> reactivity to hiv- <dig> subtypes b, c, and a/e


CONCLUSIONS
although the polyvalent approach achieved only a modest increase in the breadth of humoral and cellular immunity, the qualitative change in the vaccine  resulted in a quantitative improvement in vaccine-induced immunity.
