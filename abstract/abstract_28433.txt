BACKGROUND
the brucella genome contains an insertion sequence  element called is <dig> or is <dig>  which is specific to the genus. the copy number of is <dig> varies in the genome of the different brucella species, ranging from  <dig> in b. abortus, b. melitensis and b. suis to more than  <dig> in b. ovis and in brucella strains isolated from marine mammals. at present, there is no experimental evidence of transposition of is <dig>  but the occurrence of this element with a high copy number in some species, and the isolation of brucella strains with "ectopic" copies of is <dig> suggested that this is could still transpose.


RESULTS
in this study we obtained evidence of transposition of is <dig> from the b. ovis and b. pinnipedialis chromosomes by using the "transposon trap" plasmid pgbg <dig>  this plasmid expresses resistance to tetracycline only if the repressor gene that it contains is inactivated. the strains b. melitensis  <dig> m, b. abortus rb <dig>  b. ovis boc <dig>  and b. pinnipedialis b2/ <dig>  all containing the plasmid pgbg <dig>  were grown in culture media with tetracycline until the appearance of tetracycline resistant mutants . tcr mutants due to is <dig> transposition were only detected in b. ovis and b. pinnipedialis strains.


CONCLUSIONS
four different copies of is <dig> were found to transpose to the same target sequence in the plasmid pgbg <dig>  this demonstrated that is <dig> are active in vivo, specially in brucella species with a high number of is <dig> copies as b. ovis and b. pinnipedialis.
