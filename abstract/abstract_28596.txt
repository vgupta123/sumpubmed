BACKGROUND
although there has been considerable progress made towards understanding the molecular mechanisms of bud dormancy, the roles of protein phosphorylation in the process of dormancy regulation in woody plants remain unclear.


RESULTS
we used mass spectrometry combined with tio <dig> phosphopeptide-enrichment strategies to investigate the phosphoproteome of dormant terminal buds  in poplar . there were  <dig> unique phosphorylated sites in  <dig> phosphopeptides from  <dig> proteins;  <dig> proteins have orthologs in arabidopsis, and  <dig> proteins are unique to poplar. only  <dig> sites in proteins in poplar did not match well with the equivalent phosphorylation sites of their orthologs in arabidopsis, indicating that regulatory mechanisms are well conserved between poplar and arabidopsis. further functional classifications showed that most of these phosphoproteins were involved in binding and catalytic activity. extraction of the phosphorylation motif using motif-x indicated that proline-directed kinases are a major kinase group involved in protein phosphorylation in dormant poplar tissues.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides evidence about the significance of protein phosphorylation during dormancy, and will be useful for similar studies on other woody plants.
