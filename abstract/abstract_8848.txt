BACKGROUND
cultivated peanut , an important source of edible oil and protein, is widely grown in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. genetic improvement of yield-related traits is essential for improving yield potential of new peanut varieties. genomics-assisted breeding  can accelerate the process of genetic improvement but requires linked markers for the traits of interest. in this context, we developed a recombinant inbred line  mapping population  with  <dig> individuals and used to map quantitative trait loci  associated with three important pod features, namely pod length, pod width and hundred-pod weight.


RESULTS
qtl analysis using the phenotyping data generated across four environments in two locations and genotyping data on  <dig> mapped loci identified  <dig> qtls for pod length,  <dig> qtls for pod width and  <dig> qtls for hundred-pod weight. the phenotypic variation explained  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. thirteen qtls were consistently detected in at least two environments and three qtls  were detected in all four environments indicating their consistent and stable expression. three major qtls, detected in at least three environments, were found to be co-localized to a  <dig>  cm interval on chromosome a <dig>  and they were qpla <dig>  for pod length , qpwa <dig>  for pod width , and qhpwa <dig>  for hundred-pod weight . this  <dig>  cm linkage interval corresponds to ~ <dig>  mb genomic region of the pseudomolecule a <dig> of a. duranensis, including  <dig> annotated genes related to catalytic activity and metabolic process.


CONCLUSIONS
this study identified three major consistent and stable qtls for pod size and weight which were co-localized in a  <dig>  cm interval on chromosome a <dig>  these qtl regions not only offer further investigation for gene discovery and development of functional markers but also provide opportunity for deployment of these qtls in gab for improving yield in peanut.
