BACKGROUND
developmental cues to start meiosis occur late in plants. ameiotic <dig>  encodes a plant-specific nuclear protein  required for meiotic entry and progression through early prophase i. pollen mother cells  remain mitotic in most am <dig> mutants including am1- <dig>  while am1-prai permits meiotic entry but pmcs arrest at the leptotene/zygotene  transition, defining the roles of am <dig> protein in two distinct steps of meiosis. to gain more insights into the roles of am <dig> in the transcriptional pre-meiotic and meiotic programs, we report here an in depth analysis of gene expression alterations in carefully staged anthers at  <dig> mm  and  <dig>  mm  caused by each of these am <dig> alleles.


RESULTS
 <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm anthers of am1- <dig> and am1-prai were profiled in comparison to fertile siblings on agilent®  <dig> ×  <dig> k microarrays. both am1- <dig> and am1-prai anthers are cytologically normal at  <dig>  mm and show moderate transcriptome alterations. at the  <dig> -mm stage both mutants are aberrant cytologically, and show more drastic transcriptome changes. there are substantially more absolute on/off and twice as many differentially expressed genes  in am1- <dig> than in am1-prai. at  <dig>  mm a total of  <dig>  genes are up- or down-regulated in either am1- <dig> or am1-prai anthers. these are predominantly stage-specific transcripts. many putative meiosis-related genes were found among them including a small subset of allele-specific, mis-regulated genes specific to the pmcs. nearly 60% of transcriptome changes in the set of transcripts mis-regulated in both mutants  are enriched in pmcs, and only 1% are enriched in the tapetal cell transcriptome. all array data reported herein will be deposited and accessible at maizegdb http://www.maizegdb.org/.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis of anther transcriptome modulations by two distinct am <dig> alleles, am1- <dig> and am1-prai, redefines the role of am <dig> as a modulator of expression of a subset of meiotic genes, important for meiotic progression and provided stage-specific insights into the genetic networks associated with meiotic entry and early prophase i progression.
