BACKGROUND
variations in genome size within and between species have been observed since the  <dig> s in diverse taxonomic groups. serving as model organisms, smooth pufferfish possess the smallest vertebrate genomes. interestingly, spiny pufferfish from its sister family have genome twice as large as smooth pufferfish. therefore, comparative genomic analysis between smooth pufferfish and spiny pufferfish is useful for our understanding of genome size evolution in pufferfish.


RESULTS
ten bac clones of a spiny pufferfish diodon holocanthus were randomly selected and shotgun sequenced. in total,  <dig> kb of non-redundant sequences without gap representing  <dig> % of the d. holocanthus genome were identified, and  <dig> distinct genes were predicted. in the sequenced d. holocanthus genome,  <dig> kb is homologous with  <dig> kb of the takifugu rubripes genome, and  <dig> kb is homologous with  <dig> kb of the tetraodon nigroviridis genome. the repetitive dna accounts for 8% of the sequenced d. holocanthus genome, which is higher than that in the t. rubripes genome  and that in the te. nigroviridis genome . in the repetitive dna, 76% is retroelements which account for 6% of the sequenced d. holocanthus genome and belong to known families of transposable elements. more than half of retroelements were distributed within genes. in the non-homologous regions, repeat element proportion in d. holocanthus genome increased to  <dig> % compared with t. rubripes and increased to  <dig> % compared with te. nigroviridis. a comparison of  <dig> well-defined orthologous genes showed that the average intron size  in d. holocanthus genome is significantly longer than that in the smooth pufferfish genome .


CONCLUSIONS
compared with the smooth pufferfish, d. holocanthus has a low gene density and repeat elements rich genome. genome size variation between d. holocanthus and the smooth pufferfish exhibits as length variation between homologous region and different accumulation of non-homologous sequences. the length difference of intron is consistent with the genome size variation between d. holocanthus and the smooth pufferfish. different transposable element accumulation is responsible for genome size variation between d. holocanthus and the smooth pufferfish.
