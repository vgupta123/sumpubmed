BACKGROUND
shotgun sequencing of environmental dna is an essential technique for characterizing uncultivated microbes in situ. however, the taxonomic and functional assignment of the obtained sequence fragments remains a pressing problem.


RESULTS
existing algorithms are largely optimized for speed and coverage; in contrast, we present here a software framework that focuses on a restricted set of informative gene families, using maximum likelihood to assign these with the best possible accuracy. this framework  uses raw nucleotide sequences as input, and includes hand-curated, extensible reference information.


CONCLUSIONS
we discuss how we validated our pipeline using complete genomes as well as simulated and actual environmental sequences.
