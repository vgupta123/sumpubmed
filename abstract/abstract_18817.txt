BACKGROUND
bean-nodulating rhizobium etli originated in mesoamerica, while soybean-nodulating sinorhizobium fredii evolved in east asia. s. fredii strains, such as gr <dig>  have been isolated from bean nodules in spain, suggesting the occurrence of conjugative transfer events between introduced and native strains. in r. etli cfn <dig>  transfer of the symbiotic plasmid  requires cointegration with the endogenous self-transmissible plasmid pret42a. aiming at further understanding the generation of diversity among bean nodulating strains, we analyzed the plasmids of s. fredii gr64: psfr64a and psfr64b .


RESULTS
the conjugative transfer of the plasmids of strain gr <dig> was analyzed. plasmid psfr64a was self-transmissible, and required for transfer of the symbiotic plasmid. we sequenced psfr64a, finding  <dig> orfs. psfr64a showed three large segments of different evolutionary origins; the first one presented  <dig> orfs that were highly similar to genes located on the chromosome of sinorhizobium strain ngr234; the second one harbored  <dig> orfs with highest similarity to genes from pret42d, including the replication, but not the symbiosis genes. accordingly, psfr64a was incompatible with the r. etli cfn <dig> symbiotic plasmid, but did not contribute to symbiosis. the third segment contained  <dig> orfs with highest similarity to genes localized on pret42a,  <dig> of them involved in conjugative transfer. plasmid pret42a was unable to substitute psfr64a for induction of psym transfer, and its own transfer was significantly diminished in gr <dig> background. the symbiotic plasmid psfr64b was found to differ from typical r. etli symbiotic plasmids.


CONCLUSIONS
s. fredii gr <dig> contains a chimeric transmissible plasmid, with segments from two r. etli plasmids and a s. fredii chromosome, and a symbiotic plasmid different from the one usually found in r. etli bv phaseoli. we infer that these plasmids originated through the transfer of a symbiotic-conjugative-plasmid cointegrate from r. etli to a s. fredii strain, and at least two recombination events among the r. etli plasmids and the s. fredii genome. as in r. etli cfn <dig>  the s. fredii gr <dig> transmissible plasmid is required for the conjugative transfer of the symbiotic plasmid. in spite of the similarity in the conjugation related genes, the transfer process of these plasmids shows a host-specific behaviour.
