BACKGROUND
lrp <dig> is a membrane protein crucial in the initiation of canonical wnt/β-catenin signalling. its function is dependent on its proline-serine rich intracellular domain. lrp <dig> has five pppp motifs that are phosphorylated during activation, starting with the site closest to the membrane. like all long proline rich regions, there is no stable 3d structure for this isolated, contiguous region.


RESULTS
in our study, we use a computational simulation tool to sample the conformational space of the lrp <dig> intracellular domain, under the spatial constraints imposed by  the membrane and  the close approach of the neighboring intracellular molecular complex, which is assembled on frizzled when wnt binds to both lrp <dig> and frizzled on the opposite side of the membrane. we observe that an elongated form dominates in the lrp <dig> intracellular domain structure ensemble. this elongation could relieve conformational auto-inhibition of the ppppx motif binding sites and allow gsk <dig> and ck <dig> to approach their phosphorylation sites, thereby activating lrp <dig> and the downstream pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose a model in which the conformation of the lrp <dig> intracellular domain is elongated before activation. this is based on the intrusion of the frizzled complex into the ensemble space of the proline rich region of lrp <dig>  which alters the shape of its available ensemble space. to test whether this observed ensemble conformational change is sequence dependent, we did a control simulation with a hypothetical sequence with 50% proline and 50% serine in alternating residues. we confirm that this ensemble neighbourhood-based conformational change is independent of sequence and conclude that it is likely found in all proline rich sequences. these observations help us understand the nature of proline rich regions which are both unstructured and which seem to evolve at a higher rate of mutation, while maintaining sequence composition.
