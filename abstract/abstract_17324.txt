BACKGROUND
nitrogen and light are two major regulators of plant metabolism and development. while genes involved in the control of each of these signals have begun to be identified, regulators that integrate gene responses to nitrogen and light signals have yet to be determined. here, we evaluate the role of bzip <dig>  a transcription factor involved in light and nitrogen sensing, by exposing wild-type  and bzip <dig> t-dna null mutant plants to a combinatorial space of nitrogen  and light  treatment conditions and performing transcriptome analysis. we use anova analysis combined with clustering and boolean modeling, to evaluate the role of bzip <dig> in mediating l and n signaling genome-wide.


RESULTS
this transcriptome analysis demonstrates that a mutation in the bzip <dig> gene can alter the l and/or n-regulation of several gene clusters. more surprisingly, the bzip <dig> mutation can also trigger n and/or l regulation of genes that are not normally controlled by these signals in wt plants. this analysis also reveals that bzip <dig> can, to a large extent, invert gene regulation .


CONCLUSIONS
these findings demonstrate that the bzip <dig> mutation triggers a genome-wide de-regulation in response to l and/or n signals that range from i) a reduction of the l signal effect, to ii) unlocking gene regulation in response to l and n combinations. this systems biology approach demonstrates that bzip <dig> tunes l and n signaling relationships genome-wide, and can suppress regulatory mechanisms hypothesized to be needed at different developmental stages and/or environmental conditions.
