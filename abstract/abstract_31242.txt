BACKGROUND
the declining cost of dna sequencing is making genome sequencing a feasible option for more organisms, including many of interest to ecologists and evolutionary biologists. while obtaining high-depth, completely assembled genome sequences for most non-model organisms remains challenging, low-coverage genome survey sequences  can provide a wealth of biologically useful information at low cost. here, using a random pyrosequencing approach, we sequence the genome of the scuttle fly megaselia scalaris and evaluate the utility of our low-coverage gss approach.


RESULTS
random pyrosequencing of the m. scalaris genome provided a depth of coverage  much lower than typical gss studies. we demonstrate that, even with extremely low-coverage sequencing, bioinformatics approaches can yield extensive information about functional and repetitive elements. we also use our gss data to develop genomic resources such as a nearly complete mitochondrial genome sequence and microsatellite markers for m. scalaris.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that low-coverage genome surveys are effective at generating useful information about organisms currently lacking genomic sequence data.
