BACKGROUND
bioinformatics often leverages on recent advancements in computer science to support biologists in their scientific discovery process. such efforts include the development of easy-to-use web interfaces to biomedical databases. recent advancements in interactive web technologies require us to rethink the standard submit-and-wait paradigm, and craft bioinformatics web applications that share analytical and interactive power with their desktop relatives, while retaining simplicity and availability.


RESULTS
we have developed dictyexpress, a web application that features a graphical, highly interactive explorative interface to our database that consists of more than  <dig> dictyostelium discoideum gene expression experiments. in dictyexpress, the user can select experiments and genes, perform gene clustering, view gene expression profiles across time, view gene co-expression networks, perform analyses of gene ontology term enrichment, and simultaneously display expression profiles for a selected gene in various experiments. most importantly, these tasks are achieved through web applications whose components are seamlessly interlinked and immediately respond to events triggered by the user, thus providing a powerful explorative data analysis environment.


CONCLUSIONS
dictyexpress is a precursor for a new generation of web-based bioinformatics applications with simple but powerful interactive interfaces that resemble that of the modern desktop. while dictyexpress serves mainly the dictyostelium research community, it is relatively easy to adapt it to other datasets. we propose that the design ideas behind dictyexpress will influence the development of similar applications for other model organisms.
