BACKGROUND
the sequence read archive  is the largest public repository of sequencing data from the next generation of sequencing platforms including illumina , roche  <dig> gs system, applied biosystems solid system, helicos heliscope, pacbio rs, and others.


RESULTS
sradb is an attempt to make queries of the metadata associated with sra submission, study, sample, experiment and run more robust and precise, and make access to sequencing data in the sra easier. we have parsed all the sra metadata into a sqlite database that is routinely updated and can be easily distributed. the sradb r/bioconductor package then utilizes this sqlite database for querying and accessing metadata. full text search functionality makes querying metadata very flexible and powerful. fastq files associated with query results can be downloaded easily for local analysis. the package also includes an interface from r to a popular genome browser, the integrated genomics viewer.


CONCLUSIONS
sradb bioconductor package provides a convenient and integrated framework to query and access sra metadata quickly and powerfully from within r.
