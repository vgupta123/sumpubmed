BACKGROUND
the lancelet asymmetron inferum  was recently discovered on the ocean floor off the southwest coast of japan at a depth of  <dig> m, in an anaerobic and sulfide-rich environment caused by decomposing bodies of the sperm whale physeter macrocephalus. this deep sulfide-rich habitat of a. inferum is unique among the lancelets. the distinguishing adaptation of this species to such an extraordinary habitat can be considered in a phylogenetic framework. as the first step of reconstruction of the evolutionary processes in this species, we investigated its phylogenetic position based on  <dig> whole mitochondrial genome sequences including the newly determined ones of the whale-fall lancelet a. inferum and two coral-reef congeners.


RESULTS
our phylogenetic analyses showed that extant lancelets are clustered into two major clades, the asymmetron clade and the epigonichthys + branchiostoma clade. a. inferum was in the former and placed in the sister group to a. lucayanum complex. the divergence time between a. inferum and a. lucayanum complex was estimated to be  <dig> mya using the penalized likelihood  method or  <dig> mya using the nonparametric rate smoothing  method . these are far older than the first appearance of large whales . we also discovered that a. inferum mitogenome  has been subjected to large-scale gene rearrangements, one feature of rearrangements being unique among the lancelets and two features shared with a. lucayanum complex.


CONCLUSIONS
our study supports the monophyly of genus asymmetron assumed on the basis of the morphological characters. furthermore, the features of the a. inferum mitogenome expand our knowledge of variation within cephalochordate mitogenomes, adding a new case of transposition and inversion of the trnq gene. our divergence time estimation suggests that a. inferum remained a member of the mesozoic and the early cenozoic large vertebrate-fall communities before shifting to become a whale-fall specialist.
