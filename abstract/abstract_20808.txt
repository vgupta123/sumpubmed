BACKGROUND
regulatory t cells  play a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis and self-tolerance. the immune suppressive effects of tregs should however be limited in case effective immunity is required against pathogens or cancer cells. we previously found that the toll-like receptor  <dig>  agonist, pam3cyssk <dig>  directly stimulated tregs to expand and temporarily abrogate their suppressive capabilities. in this study, we evaluate the effect of pam3cyssk <dig> and legionella pneumophila, a natural tlr <dig> containing infectious agent, on effector t  cells and dendritic cells  individually and in co-cultures with tregs.


RESULTS
tlr <dig> agonists can directly provide a co-stimulatory signal inducing enhanced proliferation and cytokine production of naive cd4+ teff cells. with respect to cytokine production, dcs appear to be most sensitive to low amounts of tlr agonists. using wild type and tlr2-deficient cells in treg suppression assays, we accordingly show that all cells  contributed to overcome treg-mediated suppression of teff cell proliferation. furthermore, while tlr2-stimulated tregs readily lost their ability to suppress teff cell proliferation, cytokine production by teff cells was still suppressed. similar results were obtained upon stimulation with tlr <dig> ligand containing bacteria, legionella pneumophila.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings indicate that both synthetic and natural tlr <dig> agonists affect dcs, teff cells and treg directly, resulting in multi-modal modulation of treg-mediated suppression of teff cells. moreover, treg-mediated suppression of teff cell proliferation is functionally distinct from suppression of cytokine secretion.
