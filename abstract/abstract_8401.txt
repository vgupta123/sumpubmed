BACKGROUND
outbreaks in poultry involving influenza virus from h <dig> subtype have resulted in human infections, thus causing a major concern for public health, as well as for the poultry industry. currently, no efficient rapid test is available for large-scale detection of either antigen or antibody of h <dig> avian influenza viruses.


RESULTS
in the present study, a dual function elisa was developed for the effective detection of antigen and antibody against h <dig> aivs. the test was established based on antigen-capture-elisa and epitope blocking elisa. the two mabs  <dig> and  <dig> which were exploited in the assay were identified to recognize two conformational neutralizing epitopes on h <dig> ha <dig>  both of the epitopes exist in all of the human h <dig> strains, including the recent h7n <dig> strain from china and >  <dig> % of avian h <dig> strains. the dual elisa was able to detect all of the five h <dig> antigens tested without any cross reaction to other influenza subtypes. the antigen detection limit was less than  <dig> ha unit of h <dig>  for antibody detection, the sensitivity and specificity of the dual elisa was evaluated and compared to hi and microneutralization using immunized animal sera to different h <dig> strains and different subtypes of aivs. results indicated that antibodies to h <dig> were readily detected in immunized animal sera by the dual elisa whereas specimens with antibodies to other aivs yielded negative results.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first dual-function elisa reported for either antigen or antibody detection against h <dig> aivs. the assay was highly sensitive and 100% specific in both functions rendering it effective for h <dig> diagnosis.
