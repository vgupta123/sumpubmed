BACKGROUND
in an earlier study, we hypothesized that genomic segments with different sequence
organization patterns  might display functional specificity despite their
similar gc content. here we tested this hypothesis by dividing the human genome
into 100 kb segments, classifying these segments into five compositional
groups according to gc content, and then characterizing each segment within the
five groups by oligonucleotide counting , to examine the distribution of sequence
ops in the segments. we performed the csa on the entire dna, i.e., its coding and
non-coding parts the latter being much more abundant in the genome than the
former.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> op-type clusters of segments that differ in their compositional
spectrum  organization. many of the segments that shared the same op type were
enriched with genes related to the same biological processes , components of biochemical complexes, or organelles. thirteen
op-type clusters showed significant enrichment in genes connected to specific
gene-ontology terms. some of these clusters seemed to reflect certain events
during periods of horizontal gene transfer and genome expansion, and subsequent
evolution of genomic regions requiring coordinated regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
there may be a tendency for genes that are involved in the same biological
process, complex or organelle to use the same op, even at a distance of ~
100 kb from the genes. although the intergenic dna is non-coding, the general
pattern of sequence organization  may be important and were protected, to some
extent, in the course of evolution.
