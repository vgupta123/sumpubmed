BACKGROUND
glutaredoxins  are small proteins which bind glutathione to either reduce disulfide bonds or to coordinate iron sulfur clusters. whereas these well-established functions are associated with ubiquitously occurring grxs that encode variants of a cpyc or a cgfs motif in the active center, land plants also possess ccxc/s-type grxs  for which the biochemical functions are yet unknown. roxys physically and genetically interact with bzip transcription factors of the tga family. in arabidopsis, ectopically expressed roxy <dig>  negatively regulates expression of jasmonic acid/ethylene-induced defense genes through an unknown mechanism that requires at least one of the redundant transcription factors tga <dig>  tga <dig> or tga <dig> 


RESULTS
ectopically expressed roxy <dig> interferes with the activation of tga-dependent detoxification genes. similar to the tga <dig> tga <dig> tga <dig> mutant, 35s:roxy <dig> plants are more susceptible to the harmful chemical tiba . the repressive function of roxy <dig> depends on the integrity of the active site, which can be either ccmc or cpyc but not ssms. ectopic expression of the related grx roxy18/grxs <dig> also led to increased susceptibility to tiba, indicating potential functional redundancy of members of the roxy gene family. this redundancy might explain why roxy <dig> knock-out plants did not show a phenotype with respect to the regulation of the tiba-induced detoxification program. complementation of the tga <dig> tga <dig> tga <dig> mutant with either tga <dig> or tga5c186s, in which the single potential target-site of roxy <dig> had been eliminated, did not reveal any evidence for a critical redox modification that might be important for controlling the detoxification program.


CONCLUSIONS
roxy <dig> and related proteins of the roxy gene family can function as negative regulators of tga-dependent promoters controlling detoxification genes.
