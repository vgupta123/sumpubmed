BACKGROUND
stripe rust, a highly destructive foliar disease of wheat , causes severe losses, which may be accompanied by reduced photosynthetic activity and accelerated leaf senescence.

methods
we used suppression subtractive hybridization  to examine the mechanisms of resistance in the resistant wheat line l <dig> , which was derived from a lineage that includes a wide cross between common and thinopyrum intermedium. sequencing of an ssh cdna library identified  <dig> expressed sequence tags.


RESULTS
in silico mapping placed one of these tags  on chromosome 1a. primers based on  amplified a polymorphic band, which co-segregated with yrl <dig>  we cloned a candidate gene encoding wheat copper-binding protein  by amplifying the polymorphic region, and we mapped wcbp <dig> to a  <dig>  cm genetic interval. brachypodium, rice, and sorghum have genes and genomic regions syntenic to this region.

discussion
sequence analysis suggested that the resistant wcbp <dig> allele might have resulted from a deletion of 36-bp sequence of the wheat genomic sequence, rather than direct transfer from th. intermedium. qrt-pcr confirmed that wcbp <dig> expression changes in response to pathogen infection.


CONCLUSIONS
the unique chromosomal location and expression mode of wcbp <dig> suggested that wcbp <dig> is the putative candidate gene of yrl <dig>  which was involved in leaf senescence and photosynthesis related to plant responses to stripe rust infection during the grain-filling stage.
