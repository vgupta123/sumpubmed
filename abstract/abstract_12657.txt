BACKGROUND
genetic studies of the arabian peninsula are scarce even though the region was the center of ancient trade routes and empires and may have been the southern corridor for the earliest human migration from africa to asia. a total of  <dig> mtdna saudi arab lineages were analyzed for hvsi/ii sequences and for haplogroup confirmatory coding diagnostic positions. a phylogeny of the most abundant haplogroup  <dig>  was constructed based on  <dig> whole mtdna genomes.


RESULTS
the saudi arabian group showed greatest similarity to other arabian peninsula populations  and to levantine populations. nearly all the main western asia haplogroups were detected in the saudi sample, including the rare u <dig> clade. saudi arabs had only a minority sub-saharan africa component , similar to the specific north-african contribution . in addition, a small indian influence  was also detected.


CONCLUSIONS
the majority of the saudi-arab mitochondrial dna lineages  have a western asia provenance. although the still large confidence intervals, the coalescence and phylogeography of  <dig> haplogroup  matches a neolithic expansion in saudi arabia.
