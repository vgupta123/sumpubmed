BACKGROUND
synaptic loss strongly correlates with memory deterioration. local accumulation of amyloid β  peptide, and neurotoxic aβ <dig> in particular, due to abnormal neuronal activity may underlie synaptic dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and memory impairments. to gain an insight into molecular events underlying neuronal activity-regulated aβ production at the synapse, we explored functional outcomes of the newly discovered calcium-dependent interaction between alzheimer’s disease-associated presenilin  <dig> /γ-secretase and synaptic vesicle proteins.


RESULTS
mass spectrometry screen of mouse brain lysates identified synaptotagmin  <dig>  as a novel synapse-specific ps1-binding partner that shows ca2+-dependent ps <dig> binding profiles in vitro and in vivo. we found that aβ level, and more critically, conformation of the ps <dig> and the aβ42/ <dig> ratio, are affected by syt <dig> overexpression or knockdown, indicating that syt <dig> and its interaction with ps <dig> might regulate aβ production at the synapse. moreover, β-secretase  <dig>  stability, β- and γ-secretase activity, as well as intracellular compartmentalization of ps <dig> and bace <dig>  but not of amyloid precursor protein , nicastrin , presenilin enhancer  <dig> , or synaptophysin  were altered in the absence of syt <dig>  suggesting a selective effect of syt <dig> on ps <dig> and bace <dig> trafficking.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings identify syt <dig> as a novel ca2+-sensitive ps <dig> modulator that could regulate synaptic aβ, opening avenues for novel and selective synapse targeting therapeutic strategies.
