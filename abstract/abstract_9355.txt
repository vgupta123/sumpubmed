BACKGROUND
several transgenic animal models genetically predisposed to develop alzheimer's disease -like pathology have been engineered to facilitate the study of disease pathophysiology and the vetting of potential disease-modifying therapeutics. the triple transgenic mouse model of ad  harbors three ad-related genetic loci: human ps1m146v, human appswe, and human taup301l. these mice develop both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle-like pathology in a progressive and age-dependent manner, while these pathological hallmarks are predominantly restricted to the hippocampus, amygdala, and the cerebral cortex the main foci of ad neuropathology in humans. this model represents, at present, one of the most advanced preclinical tools available and is being employed ever increasingly in the study of mechanisms underlying ad, yet a detailed regional and temporal assessment of the subtleties of disease-related pathologies has not been reported.

methods and 
RESULTS
in this study, we immunohistochemically documented the evolution of ad-related transgene expression, amyloid deposition, tau phosphorylation, astrogliosis, and microglial activation throughout the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, primary motor cortex, and amygdala over a 26-month period in male 3xtg-ad mice. intracellular amyloid-beta accumulation is detectable the earliest of ad-related pathologies, followed temporally by phospho-tau, extracellular amyloid-beta, and finally paired helical filament pathology. pathology appears to be most severe in medial and caudal hippocampus. while astrocytic staining remains relatively constant at all ages and regions assessed, microglial activation appears to progressively increase temporally, especially within the hippocampal formation.


CONCLUSIONS
these data fulfill an unmet need in the ever-widening community of investigators studying 3xtg-ad mice and provide a foundation upon which to design future experiments that seek to examine stage-specific disease mechanisms and/or novel therapeutic interventions for ad.
