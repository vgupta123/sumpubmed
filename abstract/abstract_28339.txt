BACKGROUND
high-throughput technologies, such as dna microarray, have significantly advanced biological and biomedical research by enabling researchers to carry out genome-wide screens. one critical task in analyzing genome-wide datasets is to control the false discovery rate  so that the proportion of false positive features among those called significant is restrained. recently a number of fdr control methods have been proposed and widely practiced, such as the benjamini-hochberg approach, the storey approach and significant analysis of microarrays .

methods
this paper presents a straight-forward yet powerful fdr control method termed mifdr, which aims to minimize fdr when calling a fixed number of significant features. we theoretically proved that the strategy used by mifdr is able to find the optimal number of significant features when the desired fdr is fixed.


RESULTS
we compared mifdr with the bh approach, the storey approach and sam on both simulated datasets and public dna microarray datasets. the results demonstrated that mifdr outperforms others by identifying more significant features under the same fdr cut-offs. literature search showed that many genes called only by mifdr are indeed relevant to the underlying biology of interest.


CONCLUSIONS
fdr has been widely applied to analyzing high-throughput datasets allowed for rapid discoveries. under the same fdr threshold, mifdr is capable to identify more significant features than its competitors at a compatible level of complexity. therefore, it can potentially generate great impacts on biological and biomedical research.
