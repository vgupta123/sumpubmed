BACKGROUND
castration of male cattle has been shown to elicit inflammatory reactions and acute inflammation is initiated and sustained by the participation of cytokines.

methods
sixty continental × beef bulls   <dig>  months; mean weight  <dig> ±   <dig>  kg) were blocked by weight and randomly assigned to one of three treatments : 1) untreated control ; 2) banding castration at  <dig> min ; 3) burdizzo castration at  <dig> min . samples of the testis, epididymis and scrotal skin were collected surgically from  <dig> animals from each group at  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> d, and  <dig> d post-treatment, and analysed using real-time pcr. a repeated measurement analysis  was performed using sas. if there was no treatment and time interaction, main effects of treatment by time were tested by anova.


RESULTS
electrophoresis data showed that by  <dig> d post-castration rna isolated from all the testicle samples of the burd castrated animals, the epididymis and middle scrotum samples from band castrates were degraded. transitory effects were observed in the gene expression of ifn-γ, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tnf-α at  <dig> h and  <dig> h post treatment. burd castrates had greater  testicular ifn-γ mrna levels compared with band and con animals, but lower  testicular tnf-α mrna levels compared with con animals. band castrates had greater  testicular il- <dig> mrna levels than burd castrates at  <dig> h post-castration. burd castrates had greater  testicular il- <dig> mrna levels than band and con animals at  <dig> h post-castration. in the epididymis, burd castrates had greater  il- <dig> mrna  and il- <dig> mrna  levels compared with band and con animals; burd castrates had greater  il- <dig> mrna levels than band castrates at  <dig> h post-castration.


CONCLUSIONS
banding castration caused more inflammatory associated gene expression changes to the epididymis and scrotum than burdizzo. burdizzo caused more severe acute inflammatory responses, in terms of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression, in the testis and epididymis than banding.
