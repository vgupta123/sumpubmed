BACKGROUND
human papillomaviruses  are a worldwide burden as they are a widespread group of tumour viruses in humans. having a tropism for mucosal tissues, high-risk hpvs are detected in nearly all cervical cancers. hpv <dig> is the most common high-risk type but not all women infected with high-risk hpv develop a malignant tumour. likely relevant, hpv genomes are polymorphic and some hpv <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  are under evolutionary constraint instigating variable oncogenicity and immunogenicity in the infected host.


RESULTS
to investigate the tumourigenicity of two common hpv <dig> variants, we used our recently developed, three-dimensional organotypic model reminiscent of the natural hpv infectious cycle and conducted various “omics” and bioinformatics approaches. based on epidemiological studies we chose to examine the hpv <dig> asian-american  and hpv <dig> european prototype  variants. they differ by three non-synonymous snps in the transforming and virus-encoded e <dig> oncogene where aae <dig> is classified as a high- and epe <dig> as a low-risk variant. remarkably, the high-risk aae <dig> variant genome integrated into the host dna, while the low-risk epe <dig> variant genome remained episomal as evidenced by highly sensitive capt-hpv sequencing. rna-seq experiments showed that the truncated form of aae <dig>  integrated in chromosome 5q <dig>  produced a local gene over-expression and a large variety of viral-human fusion transcripts, including long distance spliced transcripts. in addition, differential enrichment of host cell pathways was observed between both hpv <dig> e <dig> variant-containing epithelia. finally, in the high-risk variant, we detected a molecular signature of host chromosomal instability, a common property of cancer cells.


CONCLUSIONS
we show how naturally occurring snps in the hpv <dig> e <dig> oncogene cause significant changes in the outcome of hpv infections and subsequent viral and host transcriptome alterations prone to drive carcinogenesis. host genome instability is closely linked to viral integration into the host genome of hpv-infected cells, which is a key phenomenon for malignant cellular transformation and the reason for uncontrolled e <dig> oncogene expression. in particular, the finding of variant-specific integration potential represents a new paradigm in hpv variant biology.
