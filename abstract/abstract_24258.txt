BACKGROUND
biological processes are usually distributed over various intracellular compartments. proteins from diverse cellular compartments are often involved in similar signaling networks. however, the difference in the reaction rates between similar proteins among different compartments is usually quite high. we suggest that the estimation of frequency of intracompartmental as well as intercompartmental protein-protein interactions is an appropriate approach to predict the efficiency of a pathway.


RESULTS
using data from the databases string, andsystem, intact and uniprot, a ppi frequency matrix of intra/inter-compartmental interactions efficiencies was constructed. this matrix included  <dig> human-specific cellular compartments. an approach for estimating pathway efficiency using the matrix of intra/inter-compartmental ppi frequency, based on analysis of reactions efficiencies distribution was suggested. an investigation of kegg pathway efficiencies was conducted using the developed method. the clusterization and the ranking of kegg pathways based on their efficiency were performed. "amino acid metabolism" and "genetic information processing" revealed the highest efficiencies among other functional classes of kegg pathways. "nervous system" and "signaling molecules interaction" contained the most inefficient pathways. statistically significant differences were found between efficiencies of kegg and randomly-generated pathways. based on these observations, the validity of this approach was discussed.


CONCLUSIONS
the estimation of efficiency of signaling networks is a complicated task because of the need for the data on the kinetic reactions. however, the proposed method does not require such data and can be used for preliminary analysis of different protein networks.
