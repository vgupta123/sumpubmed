BACKGROUND
to coordinate metabolite fluxes and energy availability, plants adjust metabolism and gene expression to environmental changes through employment of interacting signalling pathways.


RESULTS
comparing the response of arabidopsis wild-type plants with that of the mutants adg <dig>  pgr <dig> and vtc <dig> upon altered co2-availability, the regulatory role of the cellular energy status, photosynthetic electron transport, the redox state and concentration of ascorbate and glutathione and the assimilatory force was analyzed in relation to the transcript abundance of stress-responsive nuclear encoded genes and psaa and psba encoding the reaction centre proteins of photosystem i and ii, respectively. transcript abundance of bap <dig>  stp <dig>  psaa and psab was coupled with seven metabolic parameters. especially for psaa and psab, the complex analysis demonstrated that the assumed pq-dependent redox control is subordinate to signals linked to the relative availability of 3-pga and dhap, which define the assimilatory force. for the transcripts of sapx and csd <dig> high correlations with the calculated redox state of nadph were observed in pgr <dig>  but not in wild-type, suggesting that in wild-type plants signals depending on thylakoid acidification overlay a predominant redox-signal. strongest correlation with the redox state of ascorbate was observed for 2cpa, whose transcript abundance regulation however was almost insensitive to the ascorbate content demonstrating dominance of redox regulation over metabolite sensing.


CONCLUSIONS
in the mutants, signalling pathways are partially uncoupled, demonstrating dominance of metabolic control of photoreaction centre expression over sensing the redox state of the pq-pool. the balance between the cellular redox poise and the energy signature regulates sapx and csd <dig> transcript abundance, while 2cpa expression is primarily redox-controlled.
