BACKGROUND
with some  <dig> species, the pantropical crotalaria is among the angiosperm’s largest genera. we sampled 48% of the species from all sections  for nuclear and plastid dna markers to infer changes in climate niches, flower morphology, leaf type, and chromosome numbers.


RESULTS

crotalaria is monophyletic and most closely related to african bolusia  from which it diverged  <dig> to 30 ma ago. ancestral state reconstructions reveal that leaf and flower types are conserved in large clades and that leaf type is uncorrelated to climate as assessed with phylogenetically-informed analyses that related compound vs. simple leaves to the mean values of four bioclim parameters for  <dig> species with good occurrence data. most species occur in open habitats <1000 m alt., and trifoliolate leaves are the ancestral condition, from which unifoliolate and simple leaves each evolved a few times, the former predominantly in humid, the latter mainly in dry climates. based on chromosome counts for 36% of the  <dig> sequenced species, most polyploids are tetraploid and belong to a neotropical clade.


CONCLUSIONS
an unexpected finding of our study is that in crotalaria, simple leaves predominate in humid climates and compound leaves in dry climates, which points to a different adaptive value of these morphologies, regardless of whether these two leaf types evolved rarely or frequently in our focal group.
