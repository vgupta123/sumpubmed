BACKGROUND
the genus saccharothrix is a representative of the family pseudonocardiaceae, known to include producer strains of a wide variety of potent antibiotics. saccharothrix espanaensis produces both saccharomicins a and b of the promising new class of heptadecaglycoside antibiotics, active against both bacteria and yeast.


RESULTS
to better assess its capabilities, the complete genome sequence of s. espanaensis was established. with a size of  <dig> ,653 bp, coding for  <dig>  genes, it stands alongside other pseudonocardiaceae with large genomes. besides a predicted core genome of  <dig> genes shared in the family, s. espanaensis has a large number of accessory genes:  <dig>  singletons when compared to the family, of which  <dig>  have no clear orthologs in the refseq database. the genome analysis revealed the presence of  <dig> biosynthetic gene clusters potentially encoding secondary metabolites. among them, the cluster coding for the saccharomicins could be identified.


CONCLUSIONS
s. espanaensis is the first completely sequenced species of the genus saccharothrix. the genome discloses the cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of the saccharomicins, the largest oligosaccharide antibiotic currently identified. moreover, the genome revealed  <dig> additional putative secondary metabolite gene clusters further suggesting the strain’s potential for natural product synthesis.
