BACKGROUND
the myxomycete physarum polycephalum appears to have remarkable potential as a lipid source for biodiesel production. the present study evaluated the use of rice bran as a carbon source and determined the medium components for optimum growth and lipid production for this organism.


RESULTS
optimization of medium components by response surface methodology showed that rice bran and yeast extract had significant influences on lipid and biomass production. the optimum medium consisted of  <dig>  g/l rice bran,  <dig>  g/l yeast extract and  <dig>  g/l agar, and this yielded  <dig>  g/l dry biomass and  <dig>  g/l lipid after 5 days. the biomass and lipid production profiles revealed that these parameters increased over time and reached their maximum values  after 7 days. physarum polycephalum growth decreased on the spent medium but using the latter increased total biomass and lipid concentrations to  <dig>  and  <dig>  g/l, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
an effective method for inoculum preparation was developed for biomass and lipid production by p. polycephalum on a low-cost medium using rice bran as the main carbon source. these results also demonstrated the feasibility of scaling up and reusing the medium for additional biomass and lipid production.
