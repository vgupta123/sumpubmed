BACKGROUND
integrative genomics approaches that combine genotyping and transcriptome profiling in segregating populations have been developed to dissect complex traits. the most common approach is to identify genes whose eqtl colocalize with qtl of interest, providing new functional hypothesis about the causative mutation. another approach includes defining subtypes for a complex trait using transcriptome profiles and then performing qtl mapping using some of these subtypes. this approach can refine some qtl and reveal new ones.

in this paper we introduce factor analysis for multiple testing  to define subtypes more accurately and reveal interaction between qtl affecting the same trait. the data used concern hepatic transcriptome profiles for  <dig> half sib male chicken of a sire known to be heterozygous for a qtl affecting abdominal fatness  on chromosome  <dig> distal region around  <dig> cm.


RESULTS
using this methodology which accounts for hidden dependence structure among phenotypes, we identified  <dig> genes that are significantly correlated to the af trait and we distinguished  <dig> subtypes for af trait, which are not observed with gene lists obtained by classical approaches. after exclusion of one of the two lean bird subtypes, linkage analysis revealed a previously undetected qtl on chromosome  <dig> around  <dig> cm. interestingly, the animals of this subtype presented the same q paternal haplotype at the  <dig> cm qtl. this result strongly suggests that the two qtl are in interaction. in other words, the "q configuration" at the  <dig> cm qtl could hide the qtl existence in the proximal region at  <dig> cm. we further show that the proximal qtl interacts with the previous one detected on the chromosome  <dig> distal region.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that stratifying genetic population by molecular phenotypes followed by qtl analysis on various subtypes can lead to identification of novel and interacting qtl.
