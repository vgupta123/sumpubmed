BACKGROUND
tularemia was reported in china over  <dig> years ago, however, many epidemical characteristics remain unclear. in the present study, the prevalence of francisella tularensis in ticks was investigated during an epidemiological surveillance in china and then we measured their genetic diversity by conducting multiple-locus variable- number tandem repeat analysis .


RESULTS
 <dig> ticks from  <dig> endemic areas  and  <dig> non-endemic areas  were collected and tested for evidence of tularemia by nested pcr. the prevalence of francisella tularensis in ticks averaged  <dig> %. the positive rates were significantly different among tick species, with dermacentor silvarum and ixodes persulatus responsible for all positive numbers. all f. tularensis that were detected in ticks belonged to f. tularensis subsp. holarctica and mlva disclosed genetic diversity. one subtype was identified in  <dig> of  <dig> positive tick samples in three different study areas. another subtype belonging to f. tularensis subsp. holarctica genotype was described for the first time in the current study.


CONCLUSIONS
the study showed two tick species, d. silvarum and i. persulatus harboring the pathogen of tularemia in natural environment, indicating these two tick species might have a role in tularemia existence in china. mlva results disclosed the genetic diversity f. tularensis and identified one genotype as the most prevalent among the investigated ticks in china.
