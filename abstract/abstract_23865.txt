BACKGROUND
previous studies have implicated continuous or intermittent hyperglycemia in altered endothelium-derived nitric oxide  synthesis. no can regulate both the f-actin cytoskeleton and endothelial cell membrane stiffness. atomic force microscopy  is a powerful tool that can be used to study plasma membrane deformability at the single cell level. as membrane stiffness is partially dependent on filamentous f-actin, the interdependence of these parameters can be studied through the combined approaches of afm and laser scanning confocal microscopy . in the present study, we evaluated the effects of constant or fluctuating hyperglycemia on endothelial-derived no synthesis, the cytoskeletal contribution and endothelial cell membrane stiffness.


RESULTS
compared to control cells cultured in low glucose , constant  or fluctuating  high glucose significantly decreased no release along with stiffening of endothelial cell membranes and f-actin rearrangement. the non-selective nitric oxide synthase  inhibitor, ng-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester  exerted similar effects on endothelial cells. increasing concentrations of l-name  exacerbated these effects in a concentration-dependent manner.


CONCLUSIONS
result from the present study suggest that stiffening endothelial cell membranes are associated with decreased no synthesis, which was established through the f-actin cytoskeletal redistribution. the precise mechanisms of hyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction require further investigation.
