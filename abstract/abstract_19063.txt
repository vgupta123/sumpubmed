BACKGROUND
rapid clonal expansion of t cells occurs in response to antigenic challenges. the kinetics of the t cell response has previously been described using tissue-based studies performed at defined time points. luciferase bioluminescence has recently been utilized for non-invasive analysis of in vivo biologic processes in real-time.


RESULTS
we have created a novel transgenic mouse model  using a human cd <dig> mini-gene to direct luciferase expression specifically to the t cell compartment. t-lux t cells demonstrated normal homing patterns within the intact mouse and following adoptive transfer. bioluminescent signal correlated with t cell numbers in the whole body images as well as within specific organ regions of interest. following transfer into lymphopenic  recipients, homeostatic proliferation of t-lux t cells was visualized using bioluminescent imaging. real-time bioluminescent analysis of cd4+ t cell antigen-specific responses enabled real-time comparison of the kinetics and magnitude of clonal expansion and contraction in the inductive lymph node and tissue site of antigen injection. t cell expansion was dose-dependent despite the presence of supraphysiologic numbers of ova-specific ot-ii transgenic tcr t-lux t cells. cd4+ t cells subsequently underwent a rapid  contraction phase in the draining lymph node, with a delayed contraction in the antigen delivery site, with bioluminescent signal diminished below initial levels, representing tcr clonal frequency control.


CONCLUSIONS
the t-lux mouse provides a novel, efficient model for tracking in vivo aspects of the cd4+ t cell response to antigen, providing an attractive approach for studies directed at immunotherapy or vaccine design.
