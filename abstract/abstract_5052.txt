BACKGROUND
species of the genus pediococcus are known to produce antimicrobial peptides such as pediocin-like bacteriocins that contain ygngvxc as a conserved motif at their n-terminus. until now, the molecular weight of various bacteriocins produced by different strains of the genus pediococcus have been found to vary between  <dig>  to  <dig>  kd. in the present study, we characterized an antimicrobial peptide produced by p. pentosaceus strain ie- <dig> 


RESULTS
antimicrobial peptide was isolated and purified from the supernatant of p. pentosaceus strain ie- <dig> grown for 48 h using cation exchange chromatography and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography  techniques. while maldi-tof ms experiments determined the precise molecular mass of the peptide to be  <dig>  da, the de novo sequence  of the peptide revealed no similarity with reported pediocins and did not contain the ygngvxc conserved motif. unlike pediocin-like bacteriocins, the low molecular weight peptide  showed resistance to different proteases. moreover, peptide treated with reducing agent like dithiothreitol  exhibited increased activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative test strains in comparison to native peptide. however, peptide treated with oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide  did not show any antimicrobial activity.


CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge this is the lowest molecular weight peptide produced by members of the genus pediococcus. the low molecular weight peptide shared amino acid arrangement with n-terminal sequence of class iia, pediocin-like bacteriocins and showed increased activity under reducing conditions. antimicrobial peptides active under reduced conditions are valuable for the preservation of processed foods like meat, dairy and canned foods where low redox potential prevails.
