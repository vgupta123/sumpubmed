BACKGROUND
sexual morphological features are known to be associated with the mating systems of several animal groups. however, it has been suggested that morphological features other than sexual characteristics could also be constrained by the mating system as a consequence of negative associations. schistosomatidae are parasitic organisms that vary in mating system and can thus be used to explore links between the mating system and negative associations with morphological features.


RESULTS
a comparative analysis of schistosomatidae morphological features revealed an association between the mating system  and morphological characteristics of reproduction, nutrition, and locomotion.


CONCLUSIONS
the mating system drives negative associations between somatic and sexual morphological features. in monogamous species, males display a lower investment in sexual tissues and a higher commitment of resources to tissues involved in female transport, protection, and feeding assistance. in contrast, males of polygynandrous species invest to a greater extent in sexual tissues at the cost of reduced commitment to female care.
