BACKGROUND
the study used a set of  <dig> human extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli strains  isolated from  skin and soft tissue infections,  respiratory infections,  intra-abdominal infections, and  genital smears. the set was tested for bacteriocin production, for prevalence of bacteriocin and virulence determinants, and for phylogenetic typing. results obtained from the group of expec strains were compared to data from our previously published analyses of  <dig> fecal commensal e. coli strains.


RESULTS
the frequency of bacteriocinogeny was significantly higher in the set of expec strains , compared to fecal e. coli . microcin producers and microcin determinants dominated in expec strains, while colicin producers and colicin determinants were more frequent in fecal e. coli . higher production of microcin m and lower production of microcin b <dig>  colicin ib, and js was detected in the set of expec strains. expec strains had a significantly higher prevalence of phylogenetic group b <dig>  compared to fecal e. coli strains .


CONCLUSIONS
human expec strains were shown to differ from human fecal strains in a number of parameters including bacteriocin production, prevalence of several bacteriocin and virulence determinants, and prevalence of phylogenetic groups. differences in these parameters were also identified within subgroups of expec strains of diverse origin. while some microcin determinants  were associated with virulent strains, other bacteriocin types  were associated with fecal flora.
