BACKGROUND
the object of this study was to describe and contrast the kinetics of the humoral response in serum and oral fluid specimens during acute porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  infection. the study involved three trials of  <dig> boars each. boars were intramuscularly inoculated with a commercial modified live virus  vaccine , a type  <dig> prrsv field isolated , or a type  <dig> prrsv field isolate . oral fluid samples were collected from individual boars on day post inoculation  - <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig>  serum samples were collected from all boars on dpi âˆ’ <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and from  <dig> randomly selected boars on dpi  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  thereafter, serum and oral fluid were assayed for prrsv antibody using antibody isotype-specific elisas  adapted to serum or oral fluid.


RESULTS
statistically significant differences in viral replication and antibody responses were observed among the three trials in both serum and oral fluid specimens. prrsv serum igm, iga, and igg were first detected in samples collected on dpi  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. oral fluid igm, iga, and igg were detected in samples collected between dpi  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
this study enhanced our knowledge of the prrsv humoral immune response and provided a broader foundation for the development and application of oral fluid antibody-based diagnostics.
