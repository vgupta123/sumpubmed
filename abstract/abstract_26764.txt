BACKGROUND
mutations in herg and kcnq <dig> potassium channels have been associated with long qt syndrome and atrial fibrillation, and more recently with sudden infant death syndrome and sudden unexplained death. in other proteins, disease-associated amino acid mutations have been analyzed according to the chemical severity of the changes and the locations of the altered amino acids according to their conservation over metazoan evolution. here, we present the first such analysis of arrhythmia-associated mutations  in the herg and kcnq <dig> potassium channels.


RESULTS
using evolutionary analyses, aams in herg and kcnq <dig> were preferentially found at evolutionarily conserved sites and unevenly distributed among functionally conserved domains. non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms  are under-represented at evolutionarily conserved sites in herg, but distribute randomly in kcnq <dig>  aams are chemically more severe, according to grantham's scale, than changes observed in evolution and their severity correlates with the expected chemical severity of the involved codon. expected chemical severity of a given amino acid also correlates with its relative contribution to arrhythmias. at evolutionarily variable sites, the chemical severity of the changes is also correlated with the expected chemical severity of the involved codon.


CONCLUSIONS
unlike nssnps, aams preferentially locate to evolutionarily conserved, and functionally important, sites and regions within herg and kcnq <dig>  and are chemically more severe than changes which occur in evolution. expected chemical severity may contribute to the overrepresentation of certain residues in aams, as well as to evolutionary change.
