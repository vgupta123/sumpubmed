BACKGROUND
in this work we present evidence that the p <dig> tumor suppressor protein and nf-κb transcription factors could be related through common descent from a family of ancestral transcription factors regulating cellular proliferation and apoptosis. p <dig> is a homotetrameric transcription factor known to interact with the ankyrin protein 53bp <dig> . nf-κb is also regulated by ankyrin proteins, the prototype of which is the iκb family. the dna binding sequences of the two transcription factors are similar, sharing  <dig> out of  <dig> nucleotides. interactions between the two proteins, both direct and indirect, have been noted previously and the two proteins play central roles in the control of proliferation and apoptosis.


RESULTS
using previously published structure data, we noted a significant degree of structural alignment between p <dig> and nf-κb p <dig>  we also determined that iκbα and p <dig> bind in vitro through a specific interaction in part involving the dna binding region of p <dig>  or a region proximal to it, and the amino terminus of iκbα independently or cooperatively with the ankyrin  <dig> domain of iκbα in cotransfection experiments, κbα could significantly inhibit the transcriptional activity of p <dig>  inhibition of p53-mediated transcription was increased by deletion of the ankyrin  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> domains of iκbα co-precipitation experiments using the stably transfected ankyrin  <dig> deletion mutant of κbα and endogenous wild-type p <dig> further support the hypothesis that p <dig> and iκbα can physically interact in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
the aggregate results obtained using bacterially produced iκbα and p <dig> as well as reticulocyte lysate produced proteins suggest a correlation between in vitro co-precipitation in at least one of the systems and in vivo p <dig> inhibitory activity. these observations argue for a mechanism involving direct binding of iκbα to p <dig> in the inhibition of p <dig> transcriptional activity, analogous to the inhibition of nf-κb by κbα and p <dig> by 53bp2/aspp <dig>  these data furthermore suggest a role for ankyrin proteins in the regulation of p <dig> activity. taken together, the nfκb and p <dig> proteins share similarities in structure, dna binding sites and binding and regulation by ankyrin proteins in support of our hypothesis that the two proteins share common descent from an ancestral transcriptional factor.
