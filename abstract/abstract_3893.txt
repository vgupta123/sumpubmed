BACKGROUND
chromothripsis is a recently discovered phenomenon of genomic rearrangement, possibly arising during a single genome-shattering event. this could provide an alternative paradigm in cancer development, replacing the gradual accumulation of genomic changes with a “one-off” catastrophic event. however, the term has been used with varying operational definitions, with the minimal consensus being a large number of locally clustered copy number aberrations. the mechanisms underlying these chromothripsis-like patterns  and their specific impact on tumorigenesis are still poorly understood.


RESULTS
here, we identified ctlp in  <dig> cancer samples, from a dataset of more than  <dig>  oncogenomic arrays covering  <dig> cancer types. fragmentation hotspots were found to be located on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  among the various cancer types, soft-tissue tumors exhibited particularly high ctlp frequencies. genomic context analysis revealed that ctlp rearrangements frequently occurred in genomes that additionally harbored multiple copy number aberrations . an investigation into the affected chromosomal regions showed a large proportion of arm-level pulverization and telomere related events, which would be compatible to a number of underlying mechanisms. we also report evidence that these genomic events may be correlated with patient age, stage and survival rate.


CONCLUSIONS
through a large-scale analysis of oncogenomic array data sets, this study characterized features associated with genomic aberrations patterns, compatible to the spectrum of “chromothripsis”-definitions as previously used. while quantifying clustered genomic copy number aberrations in cancer samples, our data indicates an underlying biological heterogeneity behind these chromothripsis-like patterns, beyond a well defined “chromthripsis” phenomenon.
