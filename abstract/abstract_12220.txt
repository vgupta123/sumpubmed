BACKGROUND
small rnas  are widespread among bacteria and have diverse regulatory roles. most of these srnas have been discovered by a combination of computational and experimental methods. in pseudomonas aeruginosa, a ubiquitous gram-negative bacterium and opportunistic human pathogen, the gacs/gaca two-component system positively controls the transcription of two srnas , which are crucial for the expression of genes involved in virulence. in the biocontrol bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens cha <dig>  three gaca-controlled srnas  regulate the response to oxidative stress and the expression of extracellular products including biocontrol factors. rsmx, rsmy and rsmz contain multiple unpaired gga motifs and control the expression of target mrnas at the translational level, by sequestration of translational repressor proteins of the rsma family.


RESULTS
a combined computational and experimental approach enabled us to identify  <dig> intergenic regions encoding srnas in p. aeruginosa. eight of these regions encode newly identified srnas. the intergenic region  <dig> was found to specify a novel gaca-controlled srna termed rgsa. gaca regulation appeared to be indirect. in p. fluorescens cha <dig>  an rgsa homolog was also expressed under positive gaca control. this 120-nt srna contained a single gga motif and, unlike rsmx, rsmy and rsmz, was unable to derepress translation of the hcna gene , but contributed to the bacterium's resistance to hydrogen peroxide. in both p. aeruginosa and p. fluorescens the stress sigma factor rpos was essential for rgsa expression.


CONCLUSIONS
the discovery of an additional srna expressed under gaca control in two pseudomonas species highlights the complexity of this global regulatory system and suggests that the mode of action of gaca control may be more elaborate than previously suspected. our results also confirm that several gga motifs are required in an srna for sequestration of the rsma protein.
