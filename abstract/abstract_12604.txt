BACKGROUND
asian rust  is a common disease in brazilian soybean fields and it is difficult to control. to identify a biochemical candidate with potential to combat this disease, a new chitinase-like xylanase inhibitor protein  from coffee   leaves was cloned into the pgapzα-b vector for expression in pichia pastoris.


RESULTS
a cdna encoding a chitinase-like xylanase inhibitor protein  from coffee  , was isolated from leaves. the amino acid sequence predicts a  <dig> topology common to class iii chitinases , and shares similarity with other gh <dig> members, although it lacks the glutamic acid residue essential for catalysis, which is replaced by glutamine. caclxip was expressed as a recombinant protein in pichia pastoris. enzymatic assay showed that purified recombinant caclxip had only residual chitinolytic activity. however, it inhibited xylanases from acrophialophora nainiana by approx. 60% when present at 12: <dig>  enzyme:inhibitor ratio. additionally, caclxip at  <dig>  μg/μl inhibited the germination of spores of phakopsora pachyrhizi by 45%.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggests that caclxip belongs to a class of naturally inactive chitinases that have evolved to act in plant cell defence as xylanase inhibitors. its role on inhibiting germination of fungal spores makes it an eligible candidate gene for the control of asian rust.
