BACKGROUND
cellulose binding domains  were conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate . the surface concentration of the binding domains adsorbed on cellulose fibres was determined by fluorescence image analysis.


RESULTS
for a cbd-fitc concentration of  <dig> mg/l, a coating fraction of 78% and 110% was estimated for portucel and whatman fibres, respectively. for a saturating cbd concentration, using whatman cf <dig> fibres, a surface concentration of  <dig>  Ã— 10- <dig> mol/mm <dig> was estimated, the equivalent to  <dig> protein monolayers. this result does not imply the existence of several adsorbed protein layers.


CONCLUSIONS
it was verified that cbds were able to penetrate the fibres, according to confocal microscopy and tem-immunolabelling analysis. the surface concentration of adsorbed cbds was greater on amorphous fibres  than on more crystalline ones .
