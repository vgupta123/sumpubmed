BACKGROUND
soybean  is one of the most important legumes cultivated worldwide, and brazil is one of the main producers of this crop. since the sequencing of its reference genome, interest in structural and allelic variations of cultivated and wild soybean germplasm has grown. to investigate the genetics of the brazilian soybean germplasm, we selected soybean cultivars based on the year of commercialization, geographical region and maturity group and resequenced their genomes.


RESULTS
we resequenced the genomes of  <dig> brazilian soybean cultivars with an average genome coverage of  <dig> x. a total of  <dig> , <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  and  <dig> , <dig> indels were identified across the  <dig> soybean chromosomes, with  <dig>  snps,  <dig>  indels and  <dig>  cnvs that were exclusive to the  <dig> brazilian cultivars. in addition,  <dig> allelic variations of  <dig> genes were shared among all of the brazilian cultivars, including genes related to dna-dependent transcription-elongation, photosynthesis, atp synthesis-coupled electron transport, cellular respiration, and precursors of metabolite generation and energy. a very homogeneous structure was also observed for the brazilian soybean germplasm, and we observed  <dig> regions putatively influenced by positive selection. finally, we detected  <dig>  regions with copy-number variations  that could help to explain the divergence among the accessions evaluated.


CONCLUSIONS
the large number of allelic and structural variations identified in this study can be used in marker-assisted selection programs to detect unique snps for cultivar fingerprinting. the results presented here suggest that despite the diversification of modern brazilian cultivars, the soybean germplasm remains very narrow because of the large number of genome regions that exhibit low diversity. these results emphasize the need to introduce new alleles to increase the genetic diversity of the brazilian germplasm.
