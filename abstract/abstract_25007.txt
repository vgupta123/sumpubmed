BACKGROUND
estrogen therapy has positively impact the treatment of several cancers, such as prostate, lung and breast cancers. moreover, several groups have reported the importance of estrogen induced gene regulation in esophageal cancer . this suggests that there could be a potential for estrogen therapy for ec. the efficient design of estrogen therapies requires as complete as possible list of genes responsive to estrogen. our study develops a systems biology methodology using esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  as a model to identify estrogen responsive genes. these genes, on the other hand, could be affected by estrogen therapy in escc.


RESULTS
based on different sources of information we identified  <dig> genes implicated in escc. putative estrogen responsive elements  mapped to the promoter region of the escc genes were used to initially identify candidate estrogen responsive genes. eres mapped to the promoter sequence of  <dig> %  of escc genes of which  <dig> %  are known to be estrogen responsive, while  <dig> %  are new candidate estrogen responsive genes. eres did not map to  <dig> escc genes. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> %  are known to be estrogen responsive. by analyzing transcription factor binding sites  in the promoters of the  <dig>  known estrogen responsive escc genes under study, we found that their regulatory potential may be characterized by  <dig> significantly over-represented co-localized tfbss . we were able to map these ctfbss to promoters of  <dig> of the  <dig> new candidate estrogen responsive escc genes, thereby increasing confidence that these  <dig> escc genes are responsive to estrogen since their promoters contain both: a/mapped eres, and b/at least four ctfbss characteristic of escc genes that are responsive to estrogen. recent publications confirm that 47%  of these  <dig> predicted genes are indeed responsive to estrogen.


CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge our study is the first to use a cancer disease model as the framework to identify hormone responsive genes. although we used escc as the disease model and estrogen as the hormone, the methodology can be extended analogously to other diseases as the model and other hormones. we believe that our results provide useful information for those interested in genes responsive to hormones and in the design of hormone-based therapies.
