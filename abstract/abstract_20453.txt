BACKGROUND
small rna mediated gene silencing is a well-conserved regulatory pathway. in
the parasite entamoeba histolytica an endogenous rnai pathway
exists, however, the depth and diversity of the small rna population remains
unknown.


RESULTS
to characterize the small rna population that associates with e.
histolytica argonaute- <dig> , we immunoprecipitated small
rnas that associate with it and performed one full pyrosequencing run. data
analysis revealed new features of the 27nt small rnas including the
5′-g predominance, distinct small rna distribution
patterns on protein coding genes, small rnas mapping to both introns and
exon-exon junctions, and small rna targeted genes that are clustered
particularly in sections of genome duplication. characterization of genomic
loci to which both sense and antisense small rnas mapped showed that both
sets of small rnas have 5′-polyphosphate termini;
strand-specific rt-pcr detected transcripts in both directions at these loci
suggesting that both transcripts may serve as template for small rna
generation. in order to determine whether small rna abundance patterns
account for strain-specific gene expression profiles of e.
histolytica virulent and non-virulent strains, we sequenced small
rnas from a non-virulent strain and found that small rnas mapped to genes in
a manner consistent with their regulation of strain-specific virulence
genes.


CONCLUSIONS
we provided a full spectrum analysis for e. histolytica ago2-2
associated 27nt small rnas. additionally, comparative analysis of small rna
populations from virulent and non-virulent amebic strains indicates that
small rna populations may regulate virulence genes.
