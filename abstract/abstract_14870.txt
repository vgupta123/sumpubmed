BACKGROUND
puccinia striiformis is a plant pathogenic fungus causing stripe rust, one of the most important diseases on cereal crops and grasses worldwide. however, little is know about its genome and genes involved in the biology and pathogenicity of the pathogen. we initiated the functional genomic research of the fungus by constructing a full-length cdna and determined functions of the first group of genes by sequence comparison of cdna clones to genes reported in other fungi.


RESULTS
a full-length cdna library, consisting of  <dig>  clones with an average cdna insert of  <dig>  kb, was constructed using urediniospores of race pst- <dig> of p. striiformis f. sp. tritici. from  <dig> sequenced cdna clones, we determined functions of  <dig> clones . in addition,  <dig> clones  had significant homology to hypothetical proteins,  <dig> clones  had some homology to genes in other fungi, and the remaining  <dig> clones  did not produce any hits. from the  <dig> clones with functions, we identified  <dig> different genes encoding protein products that are involved in amino acid metabolism, cell defense, cell cycle, cell signaling, cell structure and growth, energy cycle, lipid and nucleotide metabolism, protein modification, ribosomal protein complex, sugar metabolism, transcription factor, transport metabolism, and virulence/infection.


CONCLUSIONS
the full-length cdna library is useful in identifying functional genes of p. striiformis.
