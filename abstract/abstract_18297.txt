BACKGROUND
following practice of skilled movements, changes continue to take place in the brain that both strengthen and modify memory for motor learning. these changes represent motor memory consolidation a process whereby new memories are transformed from a fragile to a more permanent, robust and stable state. in the present study, the neural correlates of motor memory consolidation were probed using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation  to the dorsal premotor cortex . participants engaged in four days of continuous tracking practice that immediately followed either excitatory  <dig> hz, inhibitory  <dig> hz or control, sham rtms. a delayed retention test assessed motor learning of repeated and random sequences of continuous movement; no rtms was applied at retention.


RESULTS
we discovered that  <dig> hz excitatory rtms to pmd stimulated motor memory consolidation as evidenced by off-line learning, whereas only memory stabilization was noted following  <dig> hz inhibitory or sham stimulation.


CONCLUSIONS
our data support the hypothesis that pmd is important for continuous motor learning, specifically via off-line consolidation of learned motor behaviors.
