BACKGROUND
aliivibrio wodanis and moritella viscosa have often been isolated concurrently from fish with winter-ulcer disease. little is known about the interaction between the two bacterial species and how the presence of one bacterial species affects the behaviour of the other.


RESULTS
the impact on bacterial growth in co-culture was investigated in vitro, and the presence of a. wodanis has an inhibitorial effect on m. viscosa. further, we have sequenced the complete genomes of these two marine gram-negative species, and have performed transcriptome analysis of the bacterial gene expression levels from in vivo samples. using bacterial implants in the fish abdomen, we demonstrate that the presence of a. wodanis is altering the gene expression levels of m. viscosa compared to when the bacteria are implanted separately.


CONCLUSIONS
from expression profiling of the transcriptomes, it is evident that the presence of a. wodanis is altering the global gene expression of m. viscosa. co-cultivation studies showed that a. wodanis is impeding the growth of m. viscosa, and that the inhibitorial effect is not contact-dependent.
