BACKGROUND
miscanthus is a promising biomass crop for temperate regions. despite the increasing interest in this plant, limited sequence information has constrained research into its biology, physiology, and breeding. the whole genome transcriptomes of m. sinensis and m. sacchariflorus presented in this study may provide good resources to understand functional compositions of two important miscanthus genomes and their evolutionary relationships.


RESULTS
for m. sinensis, a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  were produced from leaf and rhizome tissues, respectively, which were assembled into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons for leaf, and  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons for rhizome. for m. sacchariflorus, a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  ests from leaf and rhizome tissues, respectively, were assembled into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons for leaf, and  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons for rhizome. based on the distributions of synonymous nucleotide substitution , sorghum and miscanthus diverged about  <dig>  million years ago , saccharum and miscanthus diverged  <dig>  mya, and m. sinensis and m. sacchariflorus diverged  <dig>  mya. the pairwise alignment of predicted protein sequences from sorghum-miscanthus and two miscanthus species found a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  nssnps, respectively. the impacts of striking mutations found by nssnps were much lower between sorghum and miscanthus than those between the two miscanthus species, perhaps as a consequence of the much higher level of gene duplication in miscanthus and resulting ability to buffer essential functions against disturbance.


CONCLUSIONS
the ests generated in the present study represent a significant addition to miscanthus functional genomics resources, permitting us to discover some candidate genes associated with enhanced biomass production. ks distributions based on orthologous ests may serve as a guideline for future research into the evolution of miscanthus species as well as its close relatives sorghum and saccharum.
