BACKGROUND
the brown planthopper , nilaparvata lugens , is a serious insect pests of rice plants. major means of bph control are application of agricultural chemicals and cultivation of bph resistant rice varieties. nevertheless, bph strains that are resistant to agricultural chemicals have developed, and bph strains have appeared that are virulent against the resistant rice varieties. expressed sequence tag  analysis and related applications are useful to elucidate the mechanisms of resistance and virulence and to reveal physiological aspects of this non-model insect, with its poorly understood genetic background.


RESULTS
more than  <dig>  high-quality ests, excluding sequences of mitochondrial genome, microbial genomes, and rdna, have been produced from  <dig> libraries of various bph tissues and stages. about  <dig>  clusters have been made from whole est sequences, with average est size of  <dig> bp. among the top ten most abundantly expressed genes, three are unique and show no homology in blast searches. the actin gene was highly expressed in bph, especially in the thorax. tissue-specifically expressed genes were extracted based on the expression frequency among the libraries. an est database is available at our web site.


CONCLUSIONS
the est library will provide useful information for transcriptional analyses, proteomic analyses, and gene functional analyses of bph. moreover, specific genes for hemimetabolous insects will be identified. the microarray fabricated based on the est information will be useful for finding genes related to agricultural and biological problems related to this pest.
