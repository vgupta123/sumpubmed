BACKGROUND
a major outbreak of bloody diarrhea associated with shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli o104:h <dig> occurred early in  <dig>  to which an unusual number of hemolytic uremic syndrome cases were linked. due to limited information regarding pathogenesis and/or virulence properties of this particular serotype, we investigated the contribution of the aerobactin iron transport system during in vitro and in vivo conditions.


RESULTS
a bioluminescent reporter construct was used to perform real-time monitoring of e. coli o104:h <dig> in a mouse model of infection. we verified that our reporter strain maintained characteristics and growth kinetics that were similar to those of the wild-type e. coli strain. we found that the intestinal cecum of icr  mice was colonized by o104:h <dig>  with bacteria persisting for up to 7â€‰days after intragastric inoculation. maldi-tof analysis of heat-extracted proteins was performed to identify putative surface-exposed virulence determinants. a protein with a high similarity to the aerobactin iron receptor was identified and further demonstrated to be up-regulated in e. coli o104:h <dig> when grown on macconkey agar or during iron-depleted conditions. because the aerobactin iron acquisition system is a key virulence factor in enterobacteriaceae, an isogenic aerobactin receptor  mutant was created and its intestinal fitness assessed in the murine model. we demonstrated that the aerobactin mutant was out-competed by the wild-type e. coli o104:h <dig> during in vivo competition experiments, and the mutant was unable to persist in the cecum.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings demonstrate that bioluminescent imaging is a useful tool to monitor e. coli o104:h <dig> colonization properties, and the murine model can become a rapid way to evaluate bacterial factors associated with fitness and/or colonization during e. coli o104:h <dig> infections.
