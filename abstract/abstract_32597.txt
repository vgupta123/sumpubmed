BACKGROUND
the release of lps by bacteria stimulates both immune and specific epithelial cell types to release inflammatory mediators. it is known that lps induces the release of il- <dig> by intestinal mucosal cells. because it is now emerging that bacteria may induce alteration of epigenetic patterns in host cells, we have investigated whether lps-induced il- <dig> activation in human intestinal epithelial cells involves changes of histone modifications and/or dna methylation at il- <dig> gene regulatory region.


RESULTS
rt-pcr analysis showed that il- <dig> mrna levels rapidly increase after exposure of ht- <dig> cells to lps. dna demethylating agents had no effects on il- <dig> expression, suggesting that dna methylation was not involved in il- <dig> gene regulation. consistently we found that  <dig> cpg sites located around il- <dig> transcription start site  were unmethylated on both lower and upper strand either in lps treated or in untreated ht- <dig> cells, as well as in normal intestinal mucosa.

conversely, pretreatment of ht- <dig> cells with deacetylase inhibitors strengthened the lps-mediated il- <dig> activation. inhibitors of histone deacetylases could induce il- <dig> mrna expression also in the absence of lps, suggesting that chromatin modifications could be involved in il- <dig> gene regulation. chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that, concurrently with il- <dig> activation, transient specific changes in h <dig> acetylation and h3k <dig>  h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> methylation occurred at il- <dig> gene promoter during lps stimulation. changes of h3-acetyl, h3k4me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> levels occurred early, transiently and corresponded to transcriptional activity, while changes of h3k27me <dig> levels at il- <dig> gene occurred later and were long lasting.


CONCLUSIONS
the results showed that specific chromatin modifications occurring at il- <dig> gene, including histone h <dig> acetylation and methylation, mark lps-mediated il- <dig> activation in intestinal epithelial cells while it is unlikely that dna methylation of il- <dig> promoter is directly involved in il- <dig> gene regulation in these cells.
