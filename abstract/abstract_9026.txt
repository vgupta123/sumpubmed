BACKGROUND
trichoderma is one of the most common fungi in soil. however, little information is available concerning the diversity of trichoderma in soil with no previous history of cultivation. this study was conducted to investigate the most common species and the level of genetic relatedness of trichoderma species from uncultivated soil in relation to cultivated soil and potting media.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> trichoderma isolates were recovered from  <dig> potting media samples,  <dig> cultivated soil samples and  <dig> uncultivated soil samples, respectively. analysis based on the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal rna  and the translation elongation factor gene  indicated the presence of  <dig> trichoderma species: t. harzianum , t. asperellum , t. citrinoviride , t. orientalis , t. ghanense , t. hamatum , t. longibrachiatum , t. atroviride , and t. viride . all species were found to occur in potting media samples, while five trichoderma species were recovered from the cultivated soils and four from the uncultivated soils. aflp analysis of the  <dig> trichoderma isolates produced  <dig> genotypes and  <dig> polymorphic loci. low to moderate levels of genetic diversity were found within populations of trichoderma species . analysis of molecular variance indicated the presence of very low levels of genetic differentiation  among populations of the same trichoderma species obtained from the potting media, cultivated soil and uncultivated soil.


CONCLUSIONS
the study provides evidence for occurrence of trichoderma isolates in soil with no previous history of cultivation. the lack of genetic differentiation among trichoderma populations from potting media, cultivated soil and uncultivated soil suggests that some factors could have been responsible for moving trichoderma propagules among the three substrates. the study reports for the first time the presence of  <dig> trichoderma species in oman: t. asperellum, t. ghanense, t. longibrachiatum and t. orientalis.
