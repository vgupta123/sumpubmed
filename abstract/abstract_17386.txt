BACKGROUND
inside bluegill  retinal pigment epithelial cells, pigment granules move in response to extracellular signals. during the process of aggregation, pigment motility is directed toward the cell nucleus; in dispersion, pigment is directed away from the nucleus and into long apical processes. a number of different chemicals have been found to initiate dispersion, and carbachol  is one example. previous research indicates that the carbachol-receptor interaction activates a gq-mediated pathway which is commonly linked to ca2+ mobilization. the purpose of the present study was to test for involvement of calcium and to probe calcium-dependent mediators to reveal their role in carbachol-mediated dispersion.


RESULTS
carbachol-induced pigment granule dispersion was blocked by the calcium chelator bapta. in contrast, the calcium channel antagonist verapamil, and incubation in ca2+-free medium failed to block carbachol-induced dispersion. the calcineurin inhibitor cypermethrin blocked carbachol-induced dispersion; whereas, two protein kinase c inhibitors  failed to block carbachol-induced dispersion, and the protein kinase c activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate failed to elicit dispersion.


CONCLUSIONS
a rise in intracellular calcium is necessary for carbachol-induced dispersion; however, the ca2+ requirement is not dependent on extracellular sources, implying that intracellular stores are sufficient to enable pigment granule dispersion to occur. calcineurin is a likely ca2+-dependent mediator involved in the signal cascade. although the pathway leads to the generation of diacylglycerol and calcium , our evidence does not support a significant role for pkc.
