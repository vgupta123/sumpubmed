BACKGROUND
though microarray experiments are very popular in life science research, managing and analyzing microarray data are still challenging tasks for many biologists. most microarray programs require users to have sophisticated knowledge of mathematics, statistics and computer skills for usage. with accumulating microarray data deposited in public databases, easy-to-use programs to re-analyze previously published microarray data are in high demand.


RESULTS
ezarray is a web-based affymetrix expression array data management and analysis system for researchers who need to organize microarray data efficiently and get data analyzed instantly. ezarray organizes microarray data into projects that can be analyzed online with predefined or custom procedures. ezarray performs data preprocessing and detection of differentially expressed genes with statistical methods. all analysis procedures are optimized and highly automated so that even novice users with limited pre-knowledge of microarray data analysis can complete initial analysis quickly. since all input files, analysis parameters, and executed scripts can be downloaded, ezarray provides maximum reproducibility for each analysis. in addition, ezarray integrates with gene expression omnibus  and allows instantaneous re-analysis of published array data.


CONCLUSIONS
ezarray is a novel affymetrix expression array data analysis and sharing system. ezarray provides easy-to-use tools for re-analyzing published microarray data and will help both novice and experienced users perform initial analysis of their microarray data from the location of data storage. we believe ezarray will be a useful system for facilities with microarray services and laboratories with multiple members involved in microarray data analysis. ezarray is freely available from .
