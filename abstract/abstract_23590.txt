BACKGROUND
the activator protein- <dig>  family of transcription factors contributes to regulation of numerous genes involved in proliferation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. a wide array of stimuli can activate ap- <dig>  including pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, tumor promoters and stress. numerous plant polyphenols have been shown to inhibit the activation of ap- <dig>  which often is ascribed to the anti-oxidant properties of these natural products.

methods
in the present study, a library of substituted trans-stilbenes, including polyphenols, was screened for activity against the tpa-induced activation of ap- <dig> using the panomics ap- <dig> reporter  <dig> stable cell line, which is designed for screening potential inhibitors or activators.


RESULTS
several trans-stilbenes were identified that inhibit tpa-induced activation of ap- <dig>  with ic <dig> values as low as  <dig>  Î¼m. moreover, some other trans-stilbenes were able to enhance the effects of tpa  <dig> to 3-fold. many of the trans-stilbenes identified as inhibitors or enhancers are devoid of anti-oxidant properties.


CONCLUSIONS
the ability of trans-stilbenes to inhibit or enhance the effects of tpa does not depend upon their anti-oxidant properties.
