BACKGROUND
snp genotyping microarrays have revolutionized the study of complex disease. the current range of commercially available genotyping products contain extensive catalogues of low frequency and rare variants. existing snp calling algorithms have difficulty dealing with these low frequency variants, as the underlying models rely on each genotype having a reasonable number of observations to ensure accurate clustering.


RESULTS
here we develop krlmm, a new method for converting raw intensities into genotype calls that aims to overcome this issue. our method is unique in that it applies careful between sample normalization and allows a variable number of clusters k  for each snp, where k is predicted using the available data. we compare our method to four genotyping algorithms  on several illumina data sets that include samples from the hapmap project where the true genotypes are known in advance. all methods were found to have high overall accuracy , with krlmm consistently amongst the best. at low minor allele frequency, the krlmm, opticall and genosnp algorithms were observed to be consistently more accurate than gencall and illuminus on our test data.


CONCLUSIONS
methods that tailor their approach to calling low frequency variants by either varying the number of clusters  or using information from other snps  offer improved accuracy over methods that do not . the krlmm algorithm is implemented in the open-source crlmm package distributed via the bioconductor project .
