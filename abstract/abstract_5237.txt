BACKGROUND
enterocin as- <dig> is produced by enterococcus faecalis s <dig> to compete with other bacteria in their environment. due to its activity against various gram positive and some gram negative bacteria it has clear potential for use as a food preservative. here, we studied the effect of enterocin as- <dig> challenges on vegetative cells of bacillus cereus atcc  <dig> by use of transcriptome analysis.


RESULTS
of the  <dig> genes analysed, expression of  <dig> genes was found to change significantly after a  <dig> min treatment with a subinhibitory bacteriocin concentration of  <dig>  Î¼g/ml. most of up-regulated genes encode membrane-associated or secreted proteins with putative transmembrane segments or signal sequences, respectively. one operon involved in arginine metabolism was significantly downregulated. the bc4206-bc <dig> operon was found to be the most upregulated target in our experiments. bc <dig> codes for a padr type transcriptional regulator, while bc <dig> codes for a hypothetical membrane protein. the operon structure and genes are conserved in b. cereus and b. thuringiensis species, but are not present in b. anthracis and b. subtilis. using real-time qpcr, we show that these genes are upregulated when we treated the cells with as- <dig>  but not upon nisin treatment. upon overexpression of bc <dig> in b. cereus, we observed an increased resistance against as- <dig>  expression of bc <dig> in b. subtilis  <dig>  which lacks this operon also showed increased resistance against as- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
bc <dig> membrane protein is involved in the resistance mechanism of b. cereus cells against as- <dig>
