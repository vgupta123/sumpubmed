BACKGROUND
arginine methylation is a post-translational modification that expands the functional diversity of proteins. kinetoplastid parasites contain a relatively large group of protein arginine methyltransferases  compared to other single celled eukaryotes. several t. brucei proteins have been shown to serve as tbprmt substrates in vitro, and a great number of proteins likely to undergo methylation are predicted by the t. brucei genome. this indicates that a large number of proteins whose functions are modulated by arginine methylation await discovery in trypanosomes. here, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen using as bait the major t. brucei type i prmt, tbprmt <dig>  to identify potential substrates of this enzyme.


RESULTS
we identified a protein containing n-lip and c-lip domains that we term tblpn. these domains are usually present in a family of proteins known as lipins, and involved in phospholipid biosynthesis and gene regulation. far western and co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the tbprmt1-tblpn interaction. we also demonstrated that tblpn is localized mainly to the cytosol, and is methylated in vivo. in addition, we showed that, similar to mammalian and yeast proteins with n-lip and c-lip domains, recombinant tblpn exhibits phosphatidic acid phosphatase activity, and that two conserved aspartic acid residues present in the c-lip domain are critical for its enzymatic activity.


CONCLUSIONS
this study reports the characterization of a novel trypanosome protein and provides insight into its enzymatic activity and function in phospholipid biosynthesis. it also indicates that tblpn functions may be modulated by arginine methylation.
