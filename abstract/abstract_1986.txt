BACKGROUND
it has been estimated that more than  <dig> million workers in the united states are exposed to cobalt. occupational exposure to  <dig> co occurs mainly via inhalation and leads to various lung diseases. cobalt is classified by the iarc as a possible human carcinogen . although there is evidence for in vivo and in vitro toxicity, the mechanisms of cobalt-induced lung toxicity are not fully known. the purpose of this work was to identify potential signatures of acute cobalt exposure using a toxicogenomic approach. data analysis focused on some cellular processes and protein targets that are thought to be relevant for carcinogenesis, transport and biomarker research.


RESULTS
a time course transcriptome analysis was performed on a <dig> human pulmonary cells, leading to the identification of  <dig> genes which are repressed or induced in response to soluble  <dig> co. a group of  <dig> of these genes, representing the main biological functions, was assessed by quantitative rt-pcr. the expression profiles of six of them were then tested by quantitative rt-pcr in a time-dependent manner and three modulations were confirmed by western blotting. the  <dig> modulated genes include potential cobalt carriers , tumor suppressors or transcription factors  and genes linked to the stress response . we also identified nine genes coding for secreted proteins as candidates for biomarker research. of those, timp <dig> was found to be down-regulated and this modulation was confirmed, in a dose-dependent manner, at protein level in the supernatant of exposed cells.


CONCLUSIONS
most of these genes have never been described as related to cobalt stress and provide original hypotheses for further study of the effects of this metal ion on human lung epithelial cells. a putative biomarker of cobalt toxicity was identified.
