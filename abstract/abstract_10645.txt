BACKGROUND
among the coagulase-positive, potentially pathogenic staphylococci, staphylococcus pseudintermedius has been frequently isolated from bitches’ milk. this organism colonizes the mammary gland or causes infection, while s. aureus has been only occasionally reported. the objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence and persistence of coagulase-positive staphylococci in the colostrum and milk of postpartum bitches, either treated or untreated with antimicrobials, and to assess the incidence, antibiotic resistance profile and genetic type of the methicillin-resistant strains.

on postpartum d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  drops of secretion were collected from the mammary glands of  <dig> postpartum bitches, nine of which were treated with antimicrobials. coagulase-positive staphylococci were identified, antimicrobial susceptibility and the presence of meca were tested and the genetic profile of methicillin-resistant strains was assessed.


RESULTS
staphylococcus pseudintermedius was the only coagulase-positive staphylococcus isolated, and its presence was detected in  <dig> out of  <dig> bitches and in  <dig> out of  <dig> swabs. in a single bitch, it caused puerperal mastitis. in untreated bitches, the frequency of isolation was lower in colostrum than in milk. all of the isolates except one were resistant to at least three antimicrobial classes, while  <dig> out of 66 s. pseudintermedius strains were methicillin-resistant meca positive  and were isolated from eight bitches housed in the same breeding kennel. a significant association was found between antimicrobial treatment and the presence of mrsp. six of the  <dig> typed isolates belonged to spa-type t <dig> carrying sccmec ii/iii, and another six were non-typeable with spa carrying sccmec iv. the t02-sccmec ii/iii isolates were sequence type  71; four nt-sccmec iv isolates were st <dig> and two were st <dig>  pfge showed that isolates from the same dog had identical band patterns, while isolates from different dogs had unique band patterns. mrsp strains showed multidrug resistance profiles.


CONCLUSIONS
our results confirm that s. pseudintermedius is the most frequently isolated coagulase-positive staphylococcus from bitches’ milk. the isolation of several different strains of mrsp with different genetic characteristics in the same kennel and the fact that two of the strains belonged to a sequence type  described for the first time are noteworthy findings.
