BACKGROUND
neutral networks or sets consist of all genotypes with a given phenotype. the size and structure of these sets has a strong influence on a biological system's robustness to mutations, and on its evolvability, the ability to produce phenotypic variation; in the few studied cases of molecular phenotypes, the larger this set, the greater both robustness and evolvability of phenotypes. unfortunately, any one neutral set contains generally only a tiny fraction of genotype space. thus, current methods cannot measure neutral set sizes accurately, except in the smallest genotype spaces.


RESULTS
here we introduce a generalized monte carlo approach that can measure neutral set sizes in larger spaces. we apply our method to the genotype-to-phenotype mapping of rna molecules, and show that it can reliably measure neutral set sizes for molecules up to  <dig> bases. we also study neutral set sizes of rna structures in a publicly available database of functional, noncoding rnas up to a length of  <dig> bases. we find that these neutral sets are larger than the neutral sets in  <dig> % of random phenotypes. software to estimate neutral network sizes is available at .


CONCLUSIONS
the biological rna structures we examined are more abundant than random structures. this indicates that their robustness and their ability to produce new phenotypic variants may also be high.
