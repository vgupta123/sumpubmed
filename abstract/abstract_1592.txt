BACKGROUND
the yeast and human pcf <dig> functions in both constitutive and regulated transcription and pre-mrna processing. the constitutive roles of pcf <dig> are largely mediated by its direct interaction with rna polymerase ii c-terminal domain and a polyadenylation factor, clp <dig>  however, little is known about the mechanism of the regulatory roles of pcf <dig>  though similar to pcf <dig> in multiple aspects, arabidopsis pcf11-similar- <dig> protein  plays only a regulatory role in arabidopsis gene expression. towards understanding how pcfs <dig> regulates the expression of its direct target genes in a genome level, chip-seq approach was employed in this study to identify pcfs <dig> enrichment sites  and the es-linked genes within the arabidopsis genome.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> pcfs <dig> es sites linked to  <dig> genes were identified. distribution analysis of the es sites along the gene bodies suggested that pcfs <dig> is preferentially located on the coding sequences of the genes, consistent with its regulatory role in transcription and pre-mrna processing. gene ontology  analysis revealed that the es-linked genes were specifically enriched in a few go terms, including those categories of known pcfs <dig> functions in arabidopsis development. more interestingly, go analysis suggested novel roles of pcfs <dig>  an example is its role in circadian rhythm, which was experimentally verified herein. es site sequences analysis identified some over-represented sequence motifs shared by subsets of es sites. the motifs may explain the specificity of pcfs <dig> on its target genes and the pcfs4's functions in multiple aspects of arabidopsis development and behavior.


CONCLUSIONS
arabidopsis pcfs <dig> has been shown to specifically target on, and physically interact with, the subsets of genes. its targeting specificity is likely mediated by cis-elements shared by the genes of each subset. the potential regulation on both transcription and mrna processing levels of each subset of the genes may explain the functions of pcfs <dig> in multiple aspects of arabidopsis development and behavior.
