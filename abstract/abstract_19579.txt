BACKGROUND
the flat bones of the skull  normally form through intramembranous ossification. at these sites cranial mesenchymal cells directly differentiate into osteoblasts without the formation of a cartilage intermediate. this type of ossification is distinct from endochondral ossification, a process that involves initial formation of cartilage and later replacement by bone.


RESULTS
we have analyzed a line of transgenic mice that expresses fgf <dig>  a member of the fibroblast growth factor family , in cranial mesenchymal cells. the parietal bones in these mice show a switch from intramembranous to endochondral ossification. cranial cartilage precursors are induced to proliferate, then hypertrophy and are later replaced by bone. these changes are accompanied by upregulation of sox <dig>  ihh, col2a <dig>  col10a <dig> and downregulation of cbfai and osteocalcin. fate mapping studies show that the cranial mesenchymal cells in the parietal region that show a switch in cell fate are likely to be derived from the mesoderm.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate that fgf <dig> expression is sufficient to convert the differentiation program of  mesoderm-derived cranial mesenchyme cells from intramembranous to endochondral ossification.
