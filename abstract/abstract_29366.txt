BACKGROUND
the cell wall of mycobacterium tuberculosis contains a wide range of phosphatidyl inositol-based glycolipids that play critical structural roles and, in part, govern pathogen-host interactions. synthesis of phosphatidyl inositol is dependent on free myo-inositol, generated through dephosphorylation of myo-inositol-1-phosphate by inositol monophosphatase . human impase, the putative target of lithium therapy, has been studied extensively, but the function of four impase-like genes in m. tuberculosis is unclear.


RESULTS
we determined the crystal structure, to  <dig>  Ã… resolution, of the impase m. tuberculosis suhb in the apo form, and analysed self-assembly by analytical ultracentrifugation. contrary to the paradigm of constitutive dimerization of impases, suhb is predominantly monomeric in the absence of the physiological activator mg2+, in spite of a conserved fold and apparent dimerization in the crystal. however, mg2+ concentrations that result in enzymatic activation of suhb decisively promote dimerization, with the inhibitor li+ amplifying the effect of mg2+, but failing to induce dimerization on its own.


CONCLUSIONS
the correlation of mg2+-driven enzymatic activity with dimerization suggests that catalytic activity is linked to the dimer form. current models of lithium inhibition of impases posit that li+ competes for one of three catalytic mg2+ sites in the active site, stabilized by a mobile loop at the dimer interface. our data suggest that mg2+/li+-induced ordering of this loop may promote dimerization by expanding the dimer interface of suhb. the dynamic nature of the monomer-dimer equilibrium may also explain the extended concentration range over which mg2+ maintains suhb activity.
