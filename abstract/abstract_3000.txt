BACKGROUND
tgif and tgif <dig> are homeodomain proteins, which act as tgfβ specific smad transcriptional corepressors. tgif recruits general repressors including msin <dig> and ctbp. the related tgif <dig> protein functions in a similar manner, but does not bind ctbp. in addition to repressing tgfβ activated gene expression, tgif and tgif <dig> repress gene expression by binding directly to dna. tgif and tgif <dig> share two major blocks of similarity, encompassing the homeodomain, and a conserved carboxyl terminal repression domain. here we characterize two splice variants of the tgif <dig> gene from mouse and demonstrate that the tgif <dig> gene contains a retained intron.


RESULTS
by pcr from mouse cdna, we identified two alternate splice forms of the tgif <dig> gene. one splice variant encodes the full length  <dig> amino acid tgif <dig>  whereas the shorter form results in the removal of  <dig> codons from the centre of the coding region. the generation of this alternate splice form occurs with the mouse rna, but not the human, and both splice forms are present in all mouse tissues analyzed. human and mouse tgif <dig> coding sequences contain a retained intron, which in mouse tgif <dig> is removed by splicing from around 25–50% of rnas, as assessed by rt-pcr. this splicing event is dependent on sequences within the mouse tgif <dig> coding sequence. both splice forms of mouse tgif <dig> encode proteins which are active transcriptional repressors, and can repress both tgfβ dependent and independent transcription. in addition, we show that human and mouse tgif <dig> interact with the transcriptional corepressor msin <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these data demonstrate that the tgif <dig> gene contains a retained intron, within the second coding exon. this retained intron is not removed from the human mrna at a detectable level, but is spliced out in a significant proportion of mouse rnas. this alternate splicing is dependent entirely on sequences within the mouse tgif <dig> coding sequence, suggesting the presence of an exonic splicing enhancer. both splice forms of mouse tgif <dig> produce proteins which are functional transcriptional repressors.
