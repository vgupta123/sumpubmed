BACKGROUND
plants contain a range of aquaporin  proteins, which act as transporter of water and nutrient molecules through living membranes. aqps also participate in water uptake through the roots and contribute to water homeostasis in leaves.


RESULTS
in this study, we identified  <dig> aqp genes in the b. rapa database and br135k microarray dataset. phylogenetic analysis revealed four distinct subfamilies of aqp genes: plasma membrane intrinsic proteins , tonoplast intrinsic proteins , nod26-like intrinsic proteins  and small basic intrinsic proteins . microarray analysis showed that the majority of pip subfamily genes had differential transcript abundance between two b. rapa inbred lines chiifu and kenshin that differ in their susceptibility to cold. in addition, all brpip genes showed organ-specific expression. out of  <dig> genes,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were up-regulated in response to cold, drought and salt stresses, respectively. in addition,  <dig> brpip genes were up-regulated under aba treatment and  <dig> brpip genes were up-regulated upon f. oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans infection. moreover, all brpip genes showed down-regulation under waterlogging stress, reflecting likely the inactivation of aqps controlling symplastic water movement.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a comprehensive analysis of aqps in b. rapa and details the expression of  <dig> members of the brpip subfamily. these results provide insight into stress-related biological functions of each pip gene of the aqp family, which will promote b. rapa breeding programs.
