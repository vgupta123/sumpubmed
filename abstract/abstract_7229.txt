BACKGROUND
a metagenomic sample is a set of dna fragments, randomly extracted from multiple cells in an environment, belonging to distinct, often unknown species. unsupervised metagenomic clustering aims at partitioning a metagenomic sample into sets that approximate taxonomic units, without using reference genomes. since samples are large and steadily growing, space-efficient clustering algorithms are strongly needed.


RESULTS
we design and implement a space-efficient algorithmic framework that solves a number of core primitives in unsupervised metagenomic clustering using just the bidirectional burrows-wheeler index and a union-find data structure on the set of reads. when run on a sample of total length n, with m reads of maximum length ℓ each, on an alphabet of total size σ, our algorithms take o) time and just 2n+o+o bits of space in addition to the index and to the union-find data structure, where k is a measure of the redundancy of the sample and t is the query time of the union-find data structure.


CONCLUSIONS
our experimental results show that our algorithms are practical, they can exploit multiple cores by a parallel traversal of the suffix-link tree, and they are competitive both in space and in time with the state of the art.
