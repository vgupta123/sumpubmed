BACKGROUND
histone modifications play an important role in gene regulation. their genomic locations are of great interest. usually, the location is measured by chip-seq and analyzed with a peak-caller. replicated chip-seq experiments become more and more available. however, their analysis is based on single-experiment peak-calling or on tools like pepr which allows peak-calling of replicates but whose underlying model might not be suitable for the conditions under which the experiments are performed.


RESULTS
we propose a new peak-caller called ‘sierra platinum’ that allows peak-calling of replicated chip-seq experiments. moreover, it provides a variety of quality measures together with integrated visualizations supporting the assessment of the replicates and the resulting peaks, as well as steering the peak-calling process.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that sierra platinum outperforms currently available methods using a newly generated benchmark data set and using real data from the nih roadmap epigenomics project. it is robust against noisy replicates.
