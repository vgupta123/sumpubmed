BACKGROUND
the determination of structural haplotypes at copy number variable regions can indicate the mechanisms responsible for changes in copy number, as well as explain the relationship between gene copy number and expression. however, obtaining spatial information at regions displaying extensive copy number variation, such as the defa1a <dig> locus, is complex, because of the difficulty in the phasing and assembly of these regions. the defa1a <dig> locus is intriguing in that it falls within a region of high linkage disequilibrium, despite its high variability in copy number ; hence, the mechanisms responsible for changes in copy number at this locus are unclear.


RESULTS
in this study, a region flanking the defa1a <dig> locus was sequenced across  <dig> independent haplotypes with european ancestry, identifying five common classes of defa1a <dig> haplotype. assigning defa1a <dig> class to haplotypes within the  <dig> genomes project highlights a significant difference in defa1a <dig> class frequencies between populations with different ancestry. the features of each defa1a <dig> class, for example, the associated defa1a <dig> copy numbers, were initially assessed in a european cohort  and replicated in the  <dig> genomes samples, showing within-class similarity, but between-class and between-population differences in the features of the defa1a <dig> locus. emulsion haplotype fusion-pcr was used to generate  <dig> structural haplotypes at the defa1a <dig> locus, showing a high within-class similarity in structure.


CONCLUSIONS
structural haplotypes across the defa1a <dig> locus indicate that intra-allelic rearrangement is the predominant mechanism responsible for changes in defa1a <dig> copy number, explaining the conservation of linkage disequilibrium across the locus. the identification of common structural haplotypes at the defa1a <dig> locus could aid studies into how defa1a <dig> copy number influences expression, which is currently unclear.
