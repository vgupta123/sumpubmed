BACKGROUND
in the post-genome era, most research scientists working in the field of proteomics are confronted with difficulties in management of large volumes of data, which they are required to keep in formats suitable for subsequent data mining. therefore, a well-developed open source laboratory information management system  should be available for their proteomics research studies.


RESULTS
we developed an open source lims appropriately customized for 2-d gel electrophoresis-based proteomics workflow. the main features of its design are compactness, flexibility and connectivity to public databases. it supports the handling of data imported from mass spectrometry software and 2-d gel image analysis software. the lims is equipped with the same input interface for 2-d gel information as a clickable map on public 2dpage databases. the lims allows researchers to follow their own experimental procedures by reviewing the illustrations of 2-d gel maps and well layouts on the digestion plates and ms sample plates.


CONCLUSIONS
our new open source lims is now available as a basic model for proteome informatics, and is accessible for further improvement. we hope that many research scientists working in the field of proteomics will evaluate our lims and suggest ways in which it can be improved.
