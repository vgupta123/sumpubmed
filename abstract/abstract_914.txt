BACKGROUND
biofilm formation is an important survival strategy of salmonella in all environments. by mutant screening, we showed a knock-out mutant of fabr, encoding a repressor of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis , to have impaired biofilm formation. in order to unravel how this regulator impinges on salmonella biofilm formation, we aimed at elucidating the s. typhimurium fabr regulon. hereto, we applied a combinatorial high-throughput approach, combining chip-chip with transcriptomics.


RESULTS
all the previously identified e. coli fabr transcriptional target genes  were shown to be direct s. typhimurium fabr targets as well. as we found a fabb overexpressing strain to partly mimic the biofilm defect of the fabr mutant, the effect of fabr on biofilms can be attributed at least partly to fabb, which plays a key role in ufa biosynthesis. additionally, chip-chip identified a number of novel direct fabr targets  and yet putative direct targets . next to ufa biosynthesis, a number of these direct targets and other indirect targets identified by transcriptomics , could possibly contribute to the effect of fabr on biofilm formation.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, our results point at the importance of fabr and ufa biosynthesis in salmonella biofilm formation and their role as potential targets for biofilm inhibitory strategies.
