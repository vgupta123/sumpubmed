BACKGROUND
preliminary studies showed the prevalence of a virus similar to human hepatitis b virus  in swine from farms in china and the molecular evidence of hepadnavirus infection in domestic pigs herds in brazil. in this study, we genetically characterize the swine hepadnavirus strains in swine from slaughterhouses located in certified abattoirs from rio de janeiro state, brazil and evaluate its hepatotropic potential.


RESULTS
bile and liver samples from swine were positive for partial genome amplification , direct sequencing and viral load quantification. sequencing of the gene encoding the surface antigen allowed classification of hepadnavirus into genotypes, similar to hbv genotype classification. indirect immunofluorescence confirmed the presence of hbsag antigen in liver tissue sections.


CONCLUSIONS
so far our data suggest that commercial swine house an hbv-like virus and this relevant finding should be considered in studies on the origin and viral evolution.
