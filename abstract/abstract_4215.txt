BACKGROUND
apobec <dig>  proteins deaminate dna cytosines and block the replication of retroviruses and retrotransposons. each a <dig> gene encodes a protein with one or two conserved zinc-coordinating motifs . the presence of one a <dig> gene in mice  and seven in humans, a3a-h , suggests extraordinary evolutionary flexibility. to gain insights into the mechanism and timing of a <dig> gene expansion and into the functional modularity of these genes, we analyzed the genomic sequences, expressed cdnas and activities of the full a <dig> repertoire of three artiodactyl lineages: sheep, cattle and pigs.


RESULTS
sheep and cattle have three a <dig> genes, a3z <dig>  a3z <dig> and a3z <dig>  whereas pigs only have two, a3z <dig> and a3z <dig>  a comparison between domestic and wild pigs indicated that a3z <dig> was deleted in the pig lineage. in all three species, read-through transcription and alternative splicing also produced a catalytically active double domain a3z2-z <dig> protein that had a distinct cytoplasmic localization. thus, the three a <dig> genes of sheep and cattle encode four conserved and active proteins. these data, together with phylogenetic analyses, indicated that a similar, functionally modular a <dig> repertoire existed in the common ancestor of artiodactyls and primates . this mammalian ancestor therefore possessed the minimal a <dig> gene set, z1-z2-z <dig>  required to evolve through a remarkable series of eight recombination events into the present day eleven z domain human repertoire.


CONCLUSIONS
the dynamic recombination-filled history of the mammalian a <dig> genes is consistent with the modular nature of the locus and a model in which most of these events  were selected by ancient pathogenic retrovirus infections.
