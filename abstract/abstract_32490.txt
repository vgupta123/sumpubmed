BACKGROUND
some studies have shown that nasally administered immunobiotics had the potential to improve the outcome of influenza virus infection. however, the capacity of immunobiotics to improve protection against respiratory syncytial virus  infection was not investigated before.

objective
the aims of this study were: a) to evaluate whether the nasal administration of lactobacillus rhamnosus crl <dig>  and l. rhamnosus crl <dig>  are able to improve respiratory antiviral defenses and beneficially modulate the immune response triggered by tlr3/rig-i activation; b) to investigate whether viability of lr <dig> or lr <dig> is indispensable to modulate respiratory immunity and; c) to evaluate the capacity of lr <dig> and lr <dig> to improve the resistance of infant mice against rsv infection.


RESULTS
nasally administered lr <dig> and lr <dig> differentially modulated the tlr3/rig-i-triggered antiviral respiratory immune response. lr <dig> administration significantly modulated the production of ifn-α, ifn-β and il- <dig> in the response to poly challenge, while nasal priming with lr <dig> was more effective to improve levels of ifn-γ and il- <dig>  both viable lr <dig> and lr <dig> strains increased the resistance of infant mice to rsv infection while only heat-killed lr <dig> showed a protective effect similar to those observed with viable strains.


CONCLUSIONS
the present work demonstrated that nasal administration of immunobiotics is able to beneficially modulate the immune response triggered by tlr3/rig-i activation in the respiratory tract and to increase the resistance of mice to the challenge with rsv. comparative studies using two lactobacillus rhamnosus strains of the same origin and with similar technological properties showed that each strain has an specific immunoregulatory effect in the respiratory tract and that they differentially modulate the immune response after poly or rsv challenges, conferring different degree of protection and using distinct immune mechanisms. we also demonstrated in this work that it is possible to beneficially modulate the respiratory defenses against rsv by using heat-killed immunobiotics.
