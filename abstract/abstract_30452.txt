BACKGROUND
snp microarrays are designed to genotype single nucleotide polymorphisms . these microarrays report hybridization of dna fragments and therefore can be used for the purpose of detecting genomic fragments.


RESULTS
here, we demonstrate that a snp microarray can be effectively used in this way to perform chromatin immunoprecipitation  on chip as an alternative to tiling microarrays. we illustrate this novel application by mapping whole genome histone h <dig> hyperacetylation in human myoblasts and myotubes. we detect clusters of hyperacetylated histone h <dig>  often spanning across up to  <dig> kilobases of genomic sequence. using complementary genome-wide analyses of gene expression by dna microarray we demonstrate that these clusters of hyperacetylated histone h <dig> tend to be associated with expressed genes.


CONCLUSIONS
the use of a snp array for a chip-on-chip application  will be of great value to laboratories whose interest is the determination of general rules regarding the relationship of specific chromatin modifications to transcriptional status throughout the genome and to examine the asymmetric modification of chromatin at heterozygous loci.
