BACKGROUND
the fungus colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomene produces high levels of indole-3-acetic acid  in axenic cultures and during plant infection. we generated a suppression subtractive hybridization library enriched for iaa-induced genes and identified a clone, which was highly expressed in iaa-containing medium.


RESULTS
the corresponding gene showed similarity to oligopeptide transporters of the opt family and was therefore named cgopt <dig>  expression of cgopt <dig> in mycelia was low, and was enhanced by external application of iaa. cgopt1-silenced mutants produced less spores, had reduced pigmentation, and were less pathogenic to plants than the wild-type strain. iaa enhanced spore formation and caused changes in colony morphology in the wild-type strain, but had no effect on spore formation or colony morphology of the cgopt1-silenced mutants.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that iaa induces developmental changes in c. gloeosporioides. these changes are blocked in cgopt1-silenced mutants, suggesting that this protein is involved in regulation of fungal response to iaa. cgopt <dig> is also necessary for full virulence, but it is unclear whether this phenotype is related to auxin.
