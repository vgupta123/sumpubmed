BACKGROUND
expression of exogenous sequences in plants is often suppressed through one of the earliest described rna silencing pathways, sense post-transcriptional gene silencing . this type of suppression has made significant contributions to our knowledge of the biology of rna silencing pathways and has important consequences in plant transgenesis applications. although significant progress has been made in recent years, factors affecting the stability of transgene expression are still not well understood. it has been shown before that the efficiency of rna silencing in plants is influenced by various environmental factors.


RESULTS
here we report that a major environmental factor, light intensity, significantly affects the induction and systemic spread of s-ptgs. moreover, we show that photoadaptation to high or low light intensity conditions differentially affects mrna levels of major components of the rna silencing machinery.


CONCLUSIONS
light intensity is one of the previously unknown factors that affect transgene stability at the post-transcriptional level. our findings demonstrate an example of how environmental conditions could affect rna silencing.
