BACKGROUND
oscillatory activity, which can be separated in background and oscillatory burst pattern activities, is supposed to be representative of local synchronies of neural assemblies. oscillatory burst events should consequently play a specific functional role, distinct from background eeg activity â€“ especially for cognitive tasks , binding mechanisms and perceptual dynamics , or in clinical contexts . however extracting oscillatory events in single trials, with a reliable and consistent method, is not a simple task.


RESULTS
in this work we propose a user-friendly stand-alone toolbox, which models in a reasonable time a bump time-frequency model from the wavelet representations of a set of signals. the software is provided with a matlab toolbox which can compute wavelet representations before calling automatically the stand-alone application.


CONCLUSIONS
the tool is publicly available as a freeware at the address:
