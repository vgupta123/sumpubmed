BACKGROUND
adam <dig> is a member of the adam gene family, but the fact that it is expressed only in the nervous systems makes it unique. adam22's sequence similarity to other adams suggests it to be an integrin binder and thus to have a role in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. to elucidate the physiological functions of adam <dig>  we employed gene targeting to generate adam <dig> knockout mice.


RESULTS
adam22-deficient mice were produced in a good accordance with the mendelian ratio and appeared normal at birth. after one week, severe ataxia was observed, and all homozygotes died before weaning, probably due to convulsions. no major histological abnormalities were detected in the cerebral cortex or cerebellum of the homozygous mutants; however, marked hypomyelination of the peripheral nerves was observed.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of our study demonstrate that adam <dig> is closely involved in the correct functioning of the nervous system. further analysis of adam <dig> will provide clues to understanding the mechanisms of human diseases such as epileptic seizures and peripheral neuropathy.
