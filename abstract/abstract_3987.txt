BACKGROUND
thermophilic proteins sustain themselves and function at higher temperatures. despite their structural and functional similarities with their mesophilic homologues, they show enhanced stability. various comparative studies at genomic, protein sequence and structure levels, and experimental works highlight the different factors and dominant interacting forces contributing to this increased stability.

methods
in this comparative structure based study, we have used interaction energies between amino acids, to generate structure networks called as protein energy networks . these pens are used to compute network, sub-graph, and node specific parameters. these parameters are then compared between the thermophile-mesophile homologues.


RESULTS
the results show an increased number of clusters and low energy cliques in thermophiles as the main contributing factors for their enhanced stability. further more, we see an increase in the number of hubs in thermophiles. we also observe no community of electrostatic cliques forming in pens.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study we were able to take an energy based network approach, to identify the factors responsible for enhanced stability of thermophiles, by comparative analysis. we were able to point out that the sub-graph parameters are the prominent contributing factors. the thermophiles have a better-packed hydrophobic core. we have also discussed how thermophiles, although increasing stability through higher connectivity retains conformational flexibility, from a cliques and communities perspective.
