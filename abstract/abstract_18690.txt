BACKGROUND
resiniferatoxin  is a potent analog of capsaicin and activates transient receptor potential  vanilloid type   <dig>  in the current study, we investigated the preventive effect of perineural rtx on the development of cold hypersensitivity induced by spinal nerve ligation  in rats. furthermore, we examined the association between the expression level of trpv <dig>  trp ankyrin type   <dig> and trp melastatin type   <dig> in the dorsal root ganglion  and cold hypersensitivity after snl.


RESULTS
rtx pretreatment prevented the development of snl-induced hypersensitivity to mechanical, thermal, and cold stimuli. western blot analysis 4 weeks after rtx pretreatment showed that rtx pretreatment decreased the protein expression level of snl-induced trpm <dig>  but not trpv <dig> or trpa <dig>  in the drg of snl rats. immunofluorescent analysis revealed that up-regulated trpm8-stained neurons after snl co-localized with neurofilament 200-positive neurons located in the drg.


CONCLUSIONS
pretreatment with perineural rtx significantly inhibits snl-induced mechanical, thermal, and cold hypersensitivity. the antinociceptive effect of perineural rtx, especially on cold hypersensitivity, may be related to the suppression of trpm <dig> expression in drg.
