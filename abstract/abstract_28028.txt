BACKGROUND
triptolide is a therapeutic diterpenoid derived from the chinese herb tripterygium wilfordii hook f. triptolide has been shown to induce apoptosis by activation of pro-apoptotic proteins, inhibiting nfkb and c-kit pathways, suppressing the jak <dig> transcription, activating mapk8/jnk signaling and modulating the heat shock responses.


RESULTS
in the present study, we used lymphoblast cell lines  derived from  <dig> unrelated caucasian subjects to identify genetic markers predictive of cellular sensitivity to triptolide using genome wide association study. our results identified snps on chromosome  <dig> associated with triptolide ic <dig> . this region included biologically interesting genes as cflar, ppil <dig>  caspase 8/ <dig>  nfkb and stat <dig>  identification of a splicing-snp rs <dig>  which regulates cflar alternatively spliced isoforms predictive of the triptolide cytotoxicity suggests its role in triptolides action. our results from functional studies in panc- <dig> cell lines further demonstrate potential role of cflar in triptolide toxicity. analysis of gene-expression with cytotoxicity identified jak <dig> expression to be a significant predictor of triptolide sensitivity.


CONCLUSIONS
overall out results identified genetic factors associated with triptolide chemo-sensitivity thereby opening up opportunities to better understand its mechanism of action as well as utilize these biomarkers to predict therapeutic response in patients.
