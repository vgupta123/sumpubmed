BACKGROUND
the commercial oil palm  produces a mesocarp oil  with approximately equal proportions of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids . an increase in unsaturated fas content or iodine value  as a measure of the degree of unsaturation would help to open up new markets for the oil. one way to manipulate the fatty acid composition  in palm oil is through introgression of favourable alleles from the american oil palm, e. oleifera, which has a more unsaturated oil.


RESULTS
in this study, a segregating e. oleifera x e. guineensis  hybrid population for fac is used to identify quantitative trait loci  linked to iv and various fas. qtl analysis revealed  <dig> major and two putative qtls for iv and six fas, c14: <dig>  c16: <dig>  c16: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c18: <dig> distributed across six linkage groups , ot <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  ot <dig>  ot <dig> and t <dig>  the major qtls for iv and c16: <dig> on lgot <dig> explained  <dig>  –  <dig>  % of the phenotypic trait variation and were validated in two independent bc <dig> populations. the genomic interval contains several key structural genes in the fa and oil biosynthesis pathways such as pate/fatb, hibch, bass <dig>  lacs <dig> and dgat <dig> and also a relevant transcription factor , wri <dig>  the literature suggests that some of these genes can exhibit pleiotropic effects in the regulatory networks of these traits. using the whole genome sequence data, markers tightly linked to the candidate genes were also developed. clustering trait values according to the allelic forms of these candidate markers revealed significant differences in the iv and fas of the palms in the mapping and validation crosses.


CONCLUSIONS
the candidate gene approach described and exploited here is useful to identify the potential causal genes linked to fac and can be adopted for marker-assisted selection  in oil palm.
