BACKGROUND
a number of spider species within the family theridiidae exhibit a dramatic abdominal  color polymorphism. the polymorphism is inherited in a broadly mendelian fashion and in some species consists of dozens of discrete morphs that are convergent across taxa and populations. few genomic resources exist for spiders. here, as a first necessary step towards identifying the genetic basis for this trait we present the near complete transcriptomes of two species: the hawaiian happy-face spider theridion grallator and theridion californicum. we mined the gene complement for pigment-pathway genes and examined differential expression  between morphs that are unpatterned  and patterned .


RESULTS
by deep sequencing both rna-seq and normalized cdna libraries from pooled specimens of each species we were able to assemble a comprehensive gene set for both species that we estimate to be 98-99% complete. it is likely that these species express more than  <dig>  protein-coding genes, perhaps  <dig> %  of which might be unique to spiders. mining for pigment-associated drosophila melanogaster genes indicated the presence of all ommochrome pathway genes and most pteridine pathway genes and de analyses further indicate a possible role for the pteridine pathway in theridiid color patterning.


CONCLUSIONS
based upon our estimates, t. grallator and t. californicum express a large inventory of protein-coding genes. our comprehensive assembly illustrates the continuing value of sequencing normalized cdna libraries in addition to rna-seq in order to generate a reference transcriptome for non-model species. the identification of pteridine-related genes and their possible involvement in color patterning is a novel finding in spiders and one that suggests a biochemical link between guanine deposits and the pigments exhibited by these species.
