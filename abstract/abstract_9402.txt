BACKGROUND
decision-making is a fundamental capacity which is crucial to many higher-order psychological functions. we recorded event-related potentials  during a visual target-identification task that required go-nogo choices. targets were identified on the basis of cross-dimensional conjunctions of particular colors and forms. color discriminability was manipulated in three conditions to determine the effects of color distinctiveness on component processes of decision-making.


RESULTS
target identification was accompanied by the emergence of prefrontal p2a and p3b. selection negativity  revealed that target-compatible features captured attention more than target-incompatible features, suggesting that intra-dimensional attentional capture was goal-contingent. no changes of cross-dimensional selection priorities were measurable when color discriminability was altered. peak latencies of the color-related sn provided a chronometric measure of the duration of attention-related neural processing. erps recorded over the frontocentral scalp  revealed that color-overlap distractors, more than form-overlap distractors, required additional late selection. the need for additional response selection induced by color-overlap distractors was severely reduced when color discriminability decreased.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose a simple model of cross-dimensional perceptual decision-making. the temporal synchrony of separate color-related and form-related choices determines whether or not distractor processing includes post-perceptual stages. erp measures contribute to a comprehensive explanation of the temporal dynamics of component processes of perceptual decision-making.
