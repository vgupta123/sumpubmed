BACKGROUND
systemic acquired resistance  is induced in non-inoculated leaves following infection with certain pathogenic strains. sar is effective against many pathogens. salicylic acid  is a signaling molecule of the sar pathway. the development of sar is associated with the induction of pathogenesis related  genes. arabidopsis non-expressor of pr <dig>  is a regulatory gene of the sa signal pathway  <cit> . sar in soybean was first reported following infection with colletotrichum trancatum that causes anthracnose disease. we investigated if sar in soybean is regulated by a pathway, similar to the one characterized in arabidopsis.


RESULTS
pathogenesis-related gene gmpr <dig> is induced following treatment of soybean plants with the sar inducer,  <dig> -dichloroisonicotinic acid  or infection with the oomycete pathogen, phytophthora sojae. in p. sojae-infected plants, sar was induced against the bacterial pathogen, pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea. soybean gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig> genes showed high identities to arabidopsis npr <dig>  they showed similar expression patterns among the organs, studied in this investigation. gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig> are the only soybean homologues of npr1and are located in homoeologous regions. in gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig> transformed arabidopsis npr1- <dig> mutant plants, sar markers:  pr- <dig> was induced following ina treatment and  bgl <dig> following infection with pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato , and sar was induced following pst infection. of the five cysteine residues, cys <dig>  cys <dig>  cys <dig>  cys <dig>  and cys <dig> involved in oligomer-monomer transition in npr <dig>  cys <dig> in gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig> proteins was substituted to ser and leu, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
complementation analyses in arabidopsis npr1- <dig> mutants revealed that homoeologous gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig> genes are orthologous to arabidopsis npr <dig>  therefore, sar pathway in soybean is most likely regulated by gmnpr <dig> genes. substitution of cys <dig> residue, essential for oligomer-monomer transition of arabidopsis npr <dig>  with ser and leu residues in gmnpr1- <dig> and gmnpr1- <dig>  respectively, suggested that there may be differences between the regulatory mechanisms of gmnpr <dig> and arabidopsis npr proteins.
