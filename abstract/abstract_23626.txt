BACKGROUND
recent publications concerning the interordinal phylogeny of placental mammals have converged on a common signal, consisting of four major radiations with some ambiguity regarding the placental root. the dna data with which these relationships have been reconstructed are easily accessible from public databases; access to morphological characters is much more difficult. here, i present a graphical web-database of morphological characters focusing on placental mammals, in tandem with a combined-data phylogenetic analysis of placental mammal phylogeny.


RESULTS
the results reinforce the growing consensus regarding the extant placental mammal clades of afrotheria, xenarthra, euarchontoglires, and laurasiatheria. unweighted parsimony applied to all dna sequences and insertion-deletion  characters of extant taxa alone support a placental root at murid rodents; combined with morphology this shifts to afrotheria. bayesian analyses of morphology, indels, and dna support both a basal position for afrotheria and the position of cretaceous eutherians outside of crown placentalia. depending on treatment of third codon positions, the affinity of several fossils  vary, highlighting the potential effect of sequence data on fossils for which such data are missing.


CONCLUSIONS
the combined dataset supports the location of the placental mammal root at afrotheria or xenarthra, not at erinaceus or rodents. even a small morphological dataset can have a marked influence on the location of the root in a combined-data analysis. additional morphological data are desirable to better reconstruct the position of several fossil taxa; and the graphic-rich, web-based morphology data matrix presented here will make it easier to incorporate more taxa into a larger data matrix.
