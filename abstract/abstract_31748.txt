BACKGROUND
although it is possible to recover the complete mitogenome directly from shotgun sequencing data, currently reported methods and pipelines are still relatively time consuming and costly. using a sample of the australian freshwater crayfish engaeus lengana, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve three-day turnaround time  from tissue sample to ncbi-ready submission file through the integration of miseq sequencing platform, nextera sample preparation protocol, mitobim assembly algorithm and mitos annotation pipeline.


RESULTS
the complete mitochondrial genome of the parastacid freshwater crayfish, engaeus lengana, was recovered by modest shotgun sequencing  using the illumina miseq benchtop sequencing platform. genome assembly using the mitobim mitogenome assembler recovered the mitochondrial genome as a single contig with a 97-fold mean coverage . the mitogenome consists of  <dig>  base pairs and contains the typical  <dig> mitochondrial genes and a non-coding at-rich region. the genome arrangement is similar to the only other published parastacid mitogenome from the australian genus cherax.


CONCLUSIONS
we infer that the gene order arrangement found in cherax destructor is common to australian crayfish and may be a derived feature of the southern hemisphere family parastacidae. further, we report to our knowledge, the simplest and fastest protocol for the recovery and assembly of complete mitochondrial genomes using the miseq benchtop sequencer.
