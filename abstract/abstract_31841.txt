BACKGROUND
the cytochrome p <dig> system is important in fungal evolution for adapting to novel ecological niches. to elucidate the evolutionary process of cytochrome p <dig> genes in fungi with different life styles, we studied the patterns of gene gains and losses in the genomes of four filamentous ascomycetes, including two saprotrophs  and neurospora crassa ) and two plant pathogens  and magnaporthe grisea ).


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> p <dig> genes were assigned to  <dig> families according to standard nomenclature. on average, only  <dig> to  <dig> genes per family were in each genome. to resolve conflicting results between different clustering analyses and standard family designation, a higher order relationship was formulated.  <dig> genes were clustered into  <dig> clans. subsequently a novel approach based on parsimony was developed to build the evolutionary models. based on these analyses, a core of  <dig> distinct clans of p450s was defined. the core clans experienced contraction in all four fungal lineages while new clans expanded in all with exception of nc. mg experienced more genes and clans gains compared to the other fungi. parsimonious analyses unanimously supported one species topology for the four fungi.


CONCLUSIONS
the four studied fungi exhibit unprecedented diversity in their p450omes in terms of coding sequence, intron-exon structures and genome locations, suggesting a complicated evolutionary history of p450s in filamentous ascomycetes. clan classification and a novel strategy were developed to study evolutionary history. contraction of core clans and expansion of novel clans were identified. the exception was the nc lineage, which exhibited pure p <dig> gene loss.
