BACKGROUND
the acetylation of the core histone nh2-terminal tails is catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases. histone acetyltransferases can be classified into two distinct groups  on the basis of cellular localization and substrate specificity. type b histone acetyltransferases, originally defined as cytoplasmic enzymes that acetylate free histones, have been proposed to play a role in the assembly of chromatin through the acetylation of newly synthesized histones h <dig> and h <dig>  to date, the only type b histone acetyltransferase activities identified are specific for histone h <dig> 


RESULTS
to better understand the role of histone acetylation in the assembly of chromatin structure, we have identified additional type b histone acetyltransferase activities specific for histone h <dig>  one such activity, termed hatb <dig> , acetylated histone h <dig> with a strong preference for free histones relative to chromatin substrates. deletion of the gcn <dig> and ada <dig> genes resulted in the loss of hatb <dig>  activity while deletion of ada <dig> had no effect. in addition, gcn5p and ada3p co-fractionated with partially purified hatb <dig>  activity while ada2p did not.


CONCLUSIONS
yeast extracts contain several histone acetyltransferase activities that show a strong preference for free histone h <dig>  one such activity, termed hatb <dig> , appears to be a novel gcn5p-containing complex which does not depend on the presence of ada2p.
