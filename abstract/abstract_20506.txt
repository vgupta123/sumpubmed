BACKGROUND
infectious bronchitis virus , a prototype of the coronaviridae family, is an economically important causative agent of infectious bronchitis in chickens and causes an acute and highly contagious upper respiratory tract infections that may lead to nephritis. however, the molecular antiviral mechanisms of chickens to ibv infection remain poorly understood. in this study, we conducted global gene expression profiling of chicken kidney tissue after nephropathogenic ibv infection to better understand the interactions between host and virus.


RESULTS
ibv infection contributed to differential expression of  <dig> genes, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated in the kidney compared to those of control chickens and  <dig> associated with immune and inflammatory responses may play important roles in the host defense response during ibv infection. twelve of the altered immune-related genes were confirmed by real-time rt-pcr. gene ontology category, kegg pathway, and gene interaction networks  were analyzed to identify relationships among differentially expressed genes involved in signal transduction, cell adhesion, immune responses, apoptosis regulation, positive regulation of the i-kappab kinase/nf-kappab cascade and response to cytokine stimulus. most of these genes were related and formed a large network, in which il <dig>  stat <dig>  myd <dig>  irf <dig> and nfkb <dig> were key genes.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provided comprehensive knowledge regarding the host transcriptional response to ibv infection in chicken kidney tissues, thereby providing insight into ibv pathogenesis, particularly the involvement of innate immune pathway genes associated with ibv infection.
