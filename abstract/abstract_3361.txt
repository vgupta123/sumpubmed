BACKGROUND
f-spondin is a multi-domain extracellular matrix  protein and a contact-repellent molecule that directs axon outgrowth and cell migration during development. the reelin_n domain and the f-spondin domain  comprise a proteolytic fragment that interacts with the cell membrane and guides the projection of commissural axons to floor plate. the fs domain is found in f-spondins, mindins, m-spondin and amphif-spondin.


RESULTS
we present the crystal structure of human f-spondin fs domain at  <dig> Å resolution. the structure reveals a ca2+-binding c <dig> domain variant with an 8-stranded antiparallel β-sandwich fold. though the primary sequences of the fs domains of f-spondin and mindin are less than 36% identical, their overall structures are very similar. the unique feature of f-spondin fs domain is the presence of three disulfide bonds associated with the n- and c-termini of the domain and a highly conserved n-linked glycosylation site. the integrin-binding motif found in mindin is not conserved in the f-spondin fs domain.


CONCLUSIONS
the structure of the f-spondin fs domain completes the structural studies of the multiple-domain ecm molecule. the homology of its core structure to a common ca2+- and lipid-binding c <dig> domain suggests that the f-spondin fs domain may be responsible for part of the membrane targeting of f-spondin in its regulation of axon development. the structural properties of the fs domain revealed in this study pave the way for further exploration into the functions of f-spondin.
