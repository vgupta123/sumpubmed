BACKGROUND
the arabidopsis thaliana protein attic <dig> is a key component of the protein import machinery at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts. as a component of the tic complex, it is believed to form a preprotein-conducting channel across the inner membrane.


RESULTS
we report a method for producing large amounts of recombinant attic <dig> using a codon-optimized strain of e. coli coupled with an autoinduction method of protein expression. this method resulted in the recombinant protein being directed to the bacterial membrane without the addition of a bacterial targeting sequence. using biochemical and biophysical approaches, we were able to demonstrate that attic <dig> homo-oligomerizes in vitro when solubilized in detergents or reconstituted into liposomes. furthermore, we present evidence that the extramembranous n-terminus of the mature protein displays characteristics that are consistent with it being an intrinsically disordered protein domain.


CONCLUSIONS
our work strengthens the hypothesis that attic <dig> functions similarly to other small α-helical integral membrane proteins, such as tim <dig>  that are involved in protein transport across membranes.
