BACKGROUND
stagonospora nodorum, a fungal ascomycete in the class dothideomycetes, is a damaging pathogen of wheat. it is a model for necrotrophic fungi that cause necrotic symptoms via the interaction of multiple effector proteins with cultivar-specific receptors. a draft genome sequence and annotation was published in  <dig>  a second-pass gene prediction using a training set of  <dig> fully est-supported genes predicted a total of  <dig> version  <dig> nuclear-encoded genes, with an additional  <dig> less reliable version  <dig> genes also retained.


RESULTS
in this study, we subjected soluble mycelial proteins to proteolysis followed by 2d lc maldi-ms/ms. comparison of the detected peptides with the gene models validated  <dig> genes. 62% of these genes  were not supported by prior est evidence. of the  <dig> validated genes, all but  <dig> were version  <dig> annotations. statistical analysis of the validated gene models revealed a preponderance of cytoplasmic and nuclear localised proteins, and proteins with intracellular-associated go terms. these statistical associations are consistent with the source of the peptides used in the study. comparison with a 6-frame translation of the s. nodorum genome assembly confirmed  <dig> existing gene annotations  and provided evidence supporting  <dig> genes with coding exon frameshift modifications,  <dig> genes with extensions of coding exons into annotated introns or untranslated regions ,  <dig> new gene annotations which were supported by tblastn to nr, and  <dig> potential new genes residing within un-assembled regions of the genome.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that 2d lc maldi-ms/ms is a powerful, rapid and economical tool to aid in the annotation of fungal genomic assemblies.
