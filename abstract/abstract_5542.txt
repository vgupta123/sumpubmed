BACKGROUND
oct <dig> is a pou-domain transcriptional factor which is essential for maintaining pluripotency in several mammalian species. the mouse, human, and bovine oct <dig> orthologs display a high conservation of nucleotide sequence and genomic organization.


RESULTS
here we report an isolation of a common vole  oct <dig> ortholog. organization and exon-intron structure of vole oct <dig> gene are similar to the gene organization in other mammalian species. it consists of five exons and a regulatory region including the minimal promoter, proximal and distal enhancers. promoter and regulatory regions of the vole oct <dig> gene also display a high similarity to the corresponding regions of oct <dig> in other mammalian species, and are active during the transient transfection within luciferase reporter constructs into mouse p <dig> embryonic carcinoma cells and tg-2a embryonic stem cells. the vole oct <dig> gene expression is detectable starting from the morula stage and until day  <dig> of embryonic development.


CONCLUSIONS
genomic organization of this gene and its intron-exon structure in vole are identical to those in all previously studied species: it comprises five exons and the regulatory region containing several conserved elements. the activity of the oct <dig> gene in vole, as well as in mouse, is confined only to pluripotent cells.
