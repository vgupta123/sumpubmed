BACKGROUND
the cellular response to dna damage is immediate and highly coordinated in order to maintain genome integrity and proper cell division. during the dna damage response , the sensor kinases tel <dig> and mec <dig> in saccharomyces cerevisiae and atm and atr in human, phosphorylate multiple mediators which activate effector proteins to initiate cell cycle checkpoints and dna repair. a subset of kinase substrates are recognized by the s/t-q cluster domain , which contains motifs of serine  or threonine  followed by a glutamine . however, the full repertoire of proteins and pathways controlled by tel <dig> and mec <dig> is unknown.


RESULTS
to identify all putative scd-containing proteins, we analyzed the distribution of s/t-q motifs within verified tel1/mec <dig> targets and arrived at a unifying scd definition of at least  <dig> s/t-q within a stretch of  <dig> residues. this new scd definition was used in a custom bioinformatics pipeline to generate a census of scd-containing proteins in both yeast and human. in yeast,  <dig> proteins were identified, a significantly larger number of hits than were expected by chance. these scd-containing proteins did not distribute equally across go-ontology terms, but were significantly enriched for those involved in processes related to the ddr. we also found a significant enrichment of proteins involved in telophase and cytokinesis, protein transport and endocytosis suggesting possible novel tel1/mec <dig> targets in these pathways. in the human proteome, a wide range of similar proteins were identified, including homologs of some scd-containing proteins found in yeast. this list also included high concentrations of proteins in the mediator, spindle pole body/centrosome and actin cytoskeleton complexes.


CONCLUSIONS
using a bioinformatic approach, we have generated a census of scd-containing proteins that are involved not only in known ddr pathways but several other pathways under tel1/mec <dig> control suggesting new putative targets for these kinases.
