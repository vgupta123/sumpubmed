BACKGROUND
a growing body of evidence has shown that krüppel-like transcription factors play a crucial role in maintaining embryonic stem cell  pluripotency and in governing esc fate decisions. krüppel-like factor  <dig>  appears to play a critical role in these processes, but detailed knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of this function is still not completely addressed.


RESULTS
by combining genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis, we have identified  <dig> putative primary targets of klf <dig> in escs. we address three main points:  the relevance of the pathways governed by klf <dig>  demonstrating that suppression or constitutive expression of single klf <dig> targets robustly affect the esc undifferentiated phenotype;  the specificity of klf <dig> compared to factors belonging to the same family, demonstrating that many klf <dig> targets are not regulated by klf <dig> and klf4; and  the specificity of klf <dig> function in escs, demonstrated by the significant differences between klf <dig> targets in escs compared to adult cells, such as keratinocytes.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these results, through the definition of a detailed list of klf <dig> transcriptional targets in mouse escs, support the important and specific functional role of klf <dig> in the maintenance of the undifferentiated esc phenotype.
