BACKGROUND
male infertility is an increasing problem in all domestic species including man. localization and identification of genes involved in defects causing male infertility provide valuable information of specific events in sperm development. sperm development is a complex process, where diploid spermatogonia develop into haploid, highly specialized spermatozoa. correct expression and function of various genes and their protein products are required for production of fertile sperm. we have identified an infertility defect in finnish yorkshire boars caused by spermatogenic arrest. the aim of this study was to locate the disease associated region using genome wide screen with the porcinesnp <dig> beadchip and identify the causal mutation by candidate gene approach.


RESULTS
in the finnish yorkshire pig population the spermatogenic arrest  defect appears to be of genetic origin and causes severe degeneration of germ cells and total absence of spermatozoa. genome wide scan with the porcinesnp <dig> beadchip localized the sa defect to porcine chromosome  <dig> in a  <dig> mbp region. sequencing of a candidate gene tex <dig> revealed a  <dig> bp insertion within exon  <dig>  which caused differential splicing of the exon and created a premature translation stop codon. the expression of tex <dig> was markedly down regulated in the testis of a sa affected boar compared to control boars and no protein product was identified by western blotting. the sa insertion sequence was also found within intron  <dig> in all analyzed animals, thus the insertion appears to be a possible duplication event.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study we report the identification of a causal mutation for infertility caused by spermatogenic arrest at an early meiotic phase. our results highlight the role of tex <dig> specifically in spermatogenesis and the importance of specific genomic remodeling events as causes for inherited defects.
