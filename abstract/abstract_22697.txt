BACKGROUND
the plant nuclear pore complex has strongly attracted the attention of the scientific community during the past few years, in particular because of its involvement in hormonal and pathogen/symbiotic signalling. in arabidopsis thaliana, more than  <dig> nucleoporins have been identified, but only a few of them have been characterized. among these, atnup <dig>  atnup <dig>  atnup <dig>  and attpr have been reported to modulate auxin signalling, since corresponding mutants are suppressors of the auxin resistance conferred by the axr <dig>  mutation. the present work is focused on atnup <dig>  which is essential for embryo and plant development. this protein is one of the three nucleoporins  of the central channel of the nuclear pore complex.


RESULTS
atnup <dig> promoter activity was detected in many organs, and particularly in the embryo sac, young germinating seedlings and at the adult stage in stipules of cauline leaves. the atnup62- <dig> mutant, harbouring a t-dna insertion in intron  <dig>  was identified as a knock-down mutant. it displayed developmental phenotypes that suggested defects in auxin transport or responsiveness. atnup <dig> mutant plantlets were found to be hypersensitive to auxin, at the cotyledon and root levels. the phenotype of the atnup62-gfp overexpressing line further supported the existence of a link between atnup <dig> and auxin signalling. furthermore, the atnup <dig> mutation led to an increase in the activity of the dr <dig> auxin-responsive promoter, and suppressed the auxin-resistant root growth and leaf serration phenotypes of the axr <dig> mutant.


CONCLUSIONS
atnup <dig> appears to be a major negative regulator of auxin signalling. auxin hypersensitivity of the atnup <dig> mutant, reminding that of atnup <dig> , is in agreement with the reported interaction between atnup <dig> and atnup <dig> proteins, and suggests closely related functions. the effect of atnup <dig> on auxin signalling likely occurs in relation to scaffold proteins of the nuclear pore complex .
