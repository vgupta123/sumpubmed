BACKGROUND
one of the key goals of oak genomics research is to identify genes of adaptive significance. this information may help to improve the conservation of adaptive genetic variation and the management of forests to increase their health and productivity. deep-coverage large-insert genomic libraries are a crucial tool for attaining this objective. we report herein the construction of a bac library for quercus robur, its characterization and an analysis of bac end sequences.


RESULTS
the ecori library generated consisted of  <dig>  clones, 7% of which had no insert. levels of chloroplast and mitochondrial contamination were below 3% and 1%, respectively. mean clone insert size was estimated at  <dig> kb. the library represents  <dig> haploid genome equivalents and, the likelihood of finding a particular oak sequence of interest is greater than 99%. genome coverage was confirmed by pcr screening of the library with  <dig> unique genetic loci sampled from the genetic linkage map. in total, about  <dig>  high-quality bac end sequences  were generated by sequencing  <dig>  clones. roughly  <dig> % of the combined bac end sequence length corresponded to known retroelements while ab initio repeat detection methods identified  <dig> additional repeats. collectively, characterized and novel repeats account for roughly  <dig> % of the genome. further analysis of the bess revealed  <dig>  putative genes suggesting at least  <dig>  genes in the oak genome. bess were aligned with the genome sequences of arabidopsis thaliana, vitis vinifera and populus trichocarpa. one putative collinear microsyntenic region encoding an alcohol acyl transferase protein was observed between oak and chromosome  <dig> of v. vinifera.


CONCLUSIONS
this bac library provides a new resource for genomic studies, including ssr marker development, physical mapping, comparative genomics and genome sequencing. bes analysis provided insight into the structure of the oak genome. these sequences will be used in the assembly of a future genome sequence for oak.
