BACKGROUND
the dense phytoplankton blooms that characterize productive regions and seasons in the oceans are dominated, from high to low latitudes and from coast line to open ocean, by comparatively few, often cosmopolitan species of diatoms. these key dominant species may undergo dramatic changes due to global climate change.


RESULTS
in order to identify molecular stress-indicators for the ubiquitous diatom species skeletonema marinoi, we tested stress-related genes in different environmental conditions  using rt-qpcr. the data show that these stressors impact algal growth rate, inducing early aging and profound changes in expression levels of the genes of interest.


CONCLUSIONS
most analyzed genes  were strongly down-regulated which may indicate a strategy to avoid unnecessary over-investment in their respective proteins. by contrast, key genes were activated  which may allow the diatom species to better cope with adverse conditions. we propose the use of this panel of genes as early bio-indicators of environmental stress factors in a changing ocean.
