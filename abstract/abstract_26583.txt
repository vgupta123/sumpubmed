BACKGROUND
estrogens are reported to increase type i and type iii collagen deposition and to regulate metalloproteinase  <dig>  expression. these proteins are reported to be dysregulated in incisional hernia formation resulting in a significantly decreased type i to iii ratio. we aimed to evaluate the β-estradiol mediated regulation of type i and type iii collagen genes as well as mmp- <dig> gene expression in fibroblasts derived from patients with or without history of recurrent incisional hernia disease. we compared primary fibroblast cultures from male/female subjects without/without incisional hernia disease.


RESULTS
incisional hernia fibroblasts  revealed a decreased type i/iii collagen mrna ratio. whereas fibroblasts from healthy female donors responded to β-estradiol, type i and type iii gene transcription is not affected in fibroblasts from males or affected females. furthermore β-estradiol had no influence on the impaired type i to iii collagen ratio in fibroblasts from recurrent hernia patients.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that β-estradiol does not restore the imbaired balance of type i/iii collagen in incisional hernia fibroblasts. furthermore, the individual was identified as an independent factor for the β-estradiol induced alterations of collagen gene expression. the observation of gender specific β-estradiol-dependent changes of collagen gene expression in vitro is of significance for future studies of cellular response.
