BACKGROUND
cation-chloride cotransporters  are indispensable for maintaining chloride homeostasis in multiple cell types, but k–cl cotransporter kcc <dig> is the only ccc member with an exclusively neuronal expression in mammals. kcc <dig> is critical for rendering fast hyperpolarizing responses of ionotropic γ-aminobutyric acid and glycine receptors in adult neurons, for neuronal migration in the developing central nervous system, and for the formation and maintenance of small dendritic protrusions—dendritic spines. deficit in kcc <dig> expression and/or activity is associated with epilepsy and neuropathic pain, and effective strategies are required to search for novel drugs augmenting kcc <dig> function.


RESULTS
we revised current methods to develop a noninvasive optical approach for assessing kcc <dig> transport activity using a previously characterized genetically encoded chloride sensor. our protocol directly assesses dynamics of kcc2-mediated chloride efflux and allows measuring genuine kcc <dig> activity with good spatial and temporal resolution. as a proof of concept, we used this approach to compare transport activities of the two known kcc <dig> splice isoforms, kcc2a and kcc2b, in mouse neuronal neuro-2a cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our noninvasive optical protocol proved to be efficient for assessment of furosemide-sensitive chloride fluxes. transport activities of the n-terminal splice isoforms kcc2a and kcc2b obtained by the novel approach matched to those reported previously using standard methods for measuring chloride fluxes.
