BACKGROUND
cultivated flax  is widely used for production of textile, food, chemical and pharmaceutical products. however, various stresses decrease flax production. search for genes, which are involved in stress response, is necessary for breeding of adaptive cultivars. imbalanced concentration of nutrient elements in soil decrease flax yields and also results in heritable changes in some flax lines. the appearance of linum insertion sequence  <dig>  is the most studied modification. however, lis- <dig> function is still unclear.


RESULTS
high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome of flax plants grown under normal , phosphate deficient , and nutrient excess  conditions was carried out using illumina platform. the assembly of transcriptome was performed, and a total of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> unique transcripts for n, p, and npk sequencing libraries were identified, respectively. we have not revealed any lis- <dig> derived mrna in our sequencing data. the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data allowed us to identify genes with potentially differential expression under imbalanced nutrition. for further investigation with qpcr,  <dig> genes were chosen and their expression levels were evaluated in the extended sampling of  <dig> flax plants. significant expression alterations were revealed for genes encoding wrky and jaz protein families under p and npk conditions. moreover, the alterations of wrky family genes differed depending on lis- <dig> presence in flax plant genome. besides, we revealed slight and lis- <dig> independent mrna level changes of krp <dig> and ing <dig> genes, which are adjacent to lis- <dig>  under nutrition stress.


CONCLUSIONS
differentially expressed genes were identified in flax plants, which were grown under phosphate deficiency and excess nutrition, on the basis of high-throughput sequencing and qpcr data. we showed that wrky and jas gene families participate in flax response to imbalanced nutrient content in soil. besides, we have not identified any mrna, which could be derived from lis- <dig>  in our transcriptome sequencing data. expression of lis- <dig> flanking genes, ing <dig> and krp <dig>  was suggested not to be nutrient stress-induced. obtained results provide new insights into edaphic stress response in flax and the role of lis- <dig> in these process.
