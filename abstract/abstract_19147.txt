BACKGROUND
canine hemangiosarcoma  is a malignant tumor with poor long-term prognosis due to development of metastasis despite aggressive treatment. the phosphatidyl-inositol- <dig> kinase/akt/mammalian target of rapamycin  pathway is involved in its endothelial pathologies; however, it remains unknown how this pathway plays a role in canine hsa. here, we characterized new canine hsa cell lines derived from nude mice-xenografted canine hsas and investigated the deregulation of the signaling pathways in these cell lines.


RESULTS
seven canine hsa cell lines were established from  <dig> xenograft canine hsas and showed characteristics of endothelial cells , that is, uptake of acetylated low-density lipoprotein and expression of canine-specific cd <dig> mrna. they showed varied morphologies and mrna expression levels for vegf-a, bfgf, hgf, igf-i, egf, pdgf-b, and their receptors. cell proliferation was stimulated by these growth factors and fetal bovine serum  in  <dig> cell line and by fbs alone in  <dig> cell lines. however, cell proliferation was not stimulated by growth factors and fbs in the remaining  <dig> cell lines. phosphorylated p44/ <dig> erk1/ <dig> was increased by fbs stimulation in  <dig> cell lines. in contrast, phosphorylation of akt at ser <dig>  mtor complex  <dig>  at ser <dig>  and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e-binding protein  <dig>  at ser <dig> was high in serum-starved condition and not altered by fbs stimulation in  <dig> cell lines, despite increased phosphorylation of these residues in normal canine ecs. this suggested that the mtorc2/akt/4e-bp <dig> pathway was constitutively activated in these  <dig> canine hsa cell lines. after cell inoculation into nude mice, canine hsa tumors were formed from  <dig> cell lines and showed akt and 4e-bp <dig> phosphorylation identical to the parental cell lines.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that the present cell lines may be useful tools for investigating the role of the mtorc2/akt/4e-bp <dig> pathway in canine hsa formation both in vivo and in vitro.
