BACKGROUND
the clinical course of cystic fibrosis  is characterized by recurrent pulmonary infections and chronic inflammation. we have recently shown that decreased methylation of the toll-like receptor- <dig>  promoter leads to an apparent cf-related up-regulation of tlr <dig>  this up-regulation could be responsible, in part, for the cf-associated enhanced proinflammatory responses to various bacterial products in epithelial cells. however, the molecular mechanisms underlying dna hypomethylation-dependent enhancement of tlr <dig> expression in cf cells remain unknown.


RESULTS
the present study indicates that there is a specific cpg region , adjacent to the sp <dig> binding site that is significantly hypomethylated in several cf epithelial cell lines. these cpgs encompass a minimal promoter region required for basal tlr <dig> expression, and suggests that cpg#18- <dig> methylation regulates tlr <dig> expression in epithelial cells. furthermore, reporter gene analysis indicated that the sp <dig> binding site is involved in the methylation-dependent regulation of the tlr <dig> promoter. inhibition of sp <dig> with mithramycin a decreased tlr <dig> expression in both cf and 5-azacytidine-treated non-cf epithelial cells. moreover, even though sp <dig> binding was not affected by cpg methylation, sp1-dependent transcription was abolished by cpg methylation.


CONCLUSIONS
this report implicates sp <dig> as a critical component of dna demethylation-dependent up-regulation of tlr <dig> expression in cf epithelial cells.
