BACKGROUND
small rna  has been described as a regulator of gene expression. in order to understand the role of maize srna  during association with endophytic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, we analyzed the srna regulated by its association with two diazotrophic bacteria, herbaspirillum seropedicae and azospirillum brasilense.


RESULTS
deep sequencing analysis was done with rna extracted from plants inoculated with h. seropedicae, allowing the identification of mirna and sirna. a total of  <dig> conserved mirna families and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified. a dynamic regulation in response to inoculation was also observed. a hypothetical model involving copper-mirna is proposed, emphasizing the fact that the up-regulation of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  which is followed by inhibition of their targets, can facilitate association with diazotrophic bacteria. similar expression patterns were observed in samples inoculated with a. brasilense. moreover, novel mirna and sirna were classified in the transposable elements  database, and an enrichment of sirna aligned with te was observed in the inoculated samples. in addition, an increase in 24-nt sirna mapping to genes was observed, which was correlated with an increase in methylation of the coding regions and a subsequent reduction in transcription.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that maize has rna-based silencing mechanisms that can trigger specific responses when plants interact with beneficial endophytic diazotrophic bacteria. our findings suggest important roles for srna regulation in maize, and probably in other plants, during association with diazotrophic bacteria, emphasizing the up-regulation of cu-mirna.
