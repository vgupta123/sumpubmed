BACKGROUND
the developing mouse kidney is currently the best-characterized model of organogenesis at a transcriptional level. detailed spatial maps have been generated for gene expression profiling combined with systematic in situ screening. these studies, however, fall short of capturing the transcriptional complexity arising from each locus due to the limited scope of microarray-based technology, which is largely based on "gene-centric" models.


RESULTS
to address this, the polyadenylated rna and microrna transcriptomes of the  <dig>  dpc mouse kidney were profiled using strand-specific rna-sequencing  to a depth sufficient to complement spatial maps from pre-existing microarray datasets. the transcriptional complexity of rnas arising from mouse refseq loci was catalogued; including  <dig> alternatively spliced transcripts and  <dig> uncharacterized alternate 3' utrs. antisense expressions for 60% of refseq genes was also detected including uncharacterized non-coding transcripts overlapping kidney progenitor markers, six <dig> and sall <dig>  and were validated by section in situ hybridization. analysis of genes known to be involved in kidney development, particularly during mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, showed an enrichment of non-coding antisense transcripts extended along protein-coding rnas.


CONCLUSIONS
the resulting resource further refines the transcriptomic cartography of kidney organogenesis by integrating deep rna sequencing data with locus-based information from previously published expression atlases. the added resolution of rna-seq has provided the basis for a transition from classical gene-centric models of kidney development towards more accurate and detailed "transcript-centric" representations, which highlights the extent of transcriptional complexity of genes that direct complex development events.
