BACKGROUND
p <dig> is recognized as a critical regulator of the cell cycle and apoptosis. mounting evidence also suggests a role for p <dig> in differentiation of cells including neuronal precursors. we studied the transcriptional role of p <dig> during nerve growth factor-induced differentiation of the pc <dig> line into neuron-like cells. we hypothesized that p <dig> contributed to pc <dig> differentiation through the regulation of gene targets distinct from its known transcriptional targets for apoptosis or dna repair.


RESULTS
using a genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation cloning technique, we identified and validated  <dig> novel p53-regulated genes following ngf treatment. the data show p <dig> protein was transcriptionally activated and contributed to ngf-mediated neurite outgrowth during differentiation of pc <dig> cells. furthermore, we describe stimulus-specific regulation of a subset of these target genes by p <dig>  the most salient differentiation-relevant target genes included wnt7b involved in dendritic extension and the tfcp2l4/grhl <dig> grainyhead homolog implicated in ectodermal development. additional targets included brk, sdk <dig>  sesn <dig>  txnl <dig>  dusp <dig>  pon <dig>  lect <dig>  pkcbpb <dig> and other genes.


CONCLUSIONS
within the pc <dig> neuronal context, putative p53-occupied genomic loci spanned the entire rattus norvegicus genome upon ngf treatment. we conclude that receptor-mediated p <dig> transcriptional activity is involved in pc <dig> differentiation and may suggest a contributory role for p <dig> in neuronal development.
