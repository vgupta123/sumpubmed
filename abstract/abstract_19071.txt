BACKGROUND
yersiniosis is a zoonotic disease reported worldwide. culture and pcr based protocols are the most common used methods for detection of pathogenic yersinia species in animal samples. pcr sensitivity could be increased by an initial enrichment step. this step is particularly useful in surveillance programs, where pcr is applied to samples from asymptomatic animals. the aim of this study was to evaluate the improvement in pathogenic yersinia species detection using a suitable enrichment method prior to the real time pcr . nine different enrichment protocols were evaluated including six different broth mediums .


RESULTS
the analysis of variance showed significant differences in yersinia detection by rtpcr according to the enrichment protocol used. these differences were higher for y. pseudotuberculosis than for y. enterocolitica. in general, samples incubated at lower temperatures yielded the highest detection rates. the best results were obtained with pbsmsb and pbs <dig>  application of pbsmsb protocol to free-ranging wild board samples improved the detection of y. enterocolitica by  <dig> % when compared with direct rtpcr. y. pseudotuberculosis detection was improved by  <dig> % when results obtained by direct rtpcr and by pbsmsb enrichment before rtpcr were analyzed in combination.


CONCLUSIONS
the data obtained in the present study indicate a difference in yersinia detection by rtpcr related to the enrichment protocol used, being pbsmsb enrichment during 15 days at 4°c and pbs during 7 days at 4°c the most efficient. the use of direct rtpcr in combination with pbsmsb enrichment prior to rtpcr resulted in an improvement in the detection rates of pathogenic yersinia in wild boar and could be useful for application in other animal samples.
