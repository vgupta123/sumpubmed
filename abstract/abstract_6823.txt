BACKGROUND
multi-drug resistant forms of pseudomonas aeruginosa  are a major source of nosocomial infections and when discharged into streams and rivers from hospital wastewater treatment plants  they are known to be able to persist for extended periods. in the city of manaus , the effluent of three hwwtps feed into the urban mindu stream which crosses the city from its rainforest source before draining into the rio negro. the stream is routinely used by manaus residents for bathing and cleaning  and, during periods of flooding, can contaminate wells used for drinking water.


RESULTS
16s rrna metagenomic sequence analysis of  <dig> cloned pcr fragments, detected an abundance of pseudomonas aeruginosa  at the stream’s rio negro drainage site, but failed to detect it at the stream’s source. an array of antimicrobial resistance profiles and resistance to all  <dig> tested antimicrobials was detected among p. aeruginosa cultures prepared from wastewater samples taken from water entering and being discharged from a manaus hwwtp. just one p. aeruginosa antimicrobial resistance profile, however, was detected from cultures made from mindu stream isolates. comparisons made between p. aeruginosa isolates’ genomic dna restriction enzyme digest fingerprints, failed to determine if any of the p. aeruginosa found in the mindu stream were of hwwtp origin, but suggested that mindu stream p. aeruginosa are from diverse origins. culturing experiments also showed that p. aeruginosa biofilm formation and the extent of biofilm formation produced were both significantly higher in multi drug resistant forms of p. aeruginosa.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that a diverse range of mdrpa are being discharged in an urban stream from a hwwtp in manaus and that p. aeruginosa strains with ampicillin and amikacin can persist well within it.
