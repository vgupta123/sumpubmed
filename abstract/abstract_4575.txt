BACKGROUND
the pepper fruit is the second most consumed vegetable worldwide. however, low temperature affects the vegetative development and reproduction of the pepper, resulting in economic losses. to identify cold-related genes regulated by abscisic acid  in pepper seedlings, cdna representational difference analysis was previously performed using a suppression subtractive hybridization method. one of the genes cloned from the subtraction was homologous to solanum tuberosum mbf <dig>  encoding the coactivator multiprotein bridging factor  <dig>  here, we have characterized this stmbf <dig> homolog  from capsicum annuum and investigated its role in abiotic stress tolerance.


RESULTS
tissue expression profile analysis using quantitative rt-pcr showed that cambf <dig> was expressed in all tested tissues, and high-level expression was detected in the flowers and seeds. the expression of cambf <dig> in pepper seedlings was dramatically suppressed by exogenously supplied salicylic acid, high salt, osmotic and heavy metal stresses. constitutive overexpression of cambf <dig> in arabidopsis aggravated the visible symptoms of leaf damage and the electrolyte leakage of cell damage caused by cold stress in seedlings. furthermore, the expression of rd29a, erd <dig>  kin <dig>  and rd <dig> in the transgenic plants was lower than that in the wild-type plants. on the other hand, seed germination, cotyledon greening and lateral root formation were more severely influenced by salt stress in transgenic lines compared with wild-type plants, indicating that cambf1-overexpressing arabidopsis plants were hypersensitive to salt stress.


CONCLUSIONS
overexpression of cambf <dig> in arabidopsis displayed reduced tolerance to cold and high salt stress during seed germination and post-germination stages. cambf <dig> transgenic arabidopsis may reduce stress tolerance by downregulating stress-responsive genes to aggravate the leaf damage caused by cold stress. cambf <dig> may be useful for genetic engineering of novel pepper cultivars in the future.
