BACKGROUND
brucellosis is primarily a zoonotic disease caused by brucella species. there are currently ten brucella spp. including the recently identified novel b. inopinata sp. isolated from a wound associated with a breast implant infection. in this study we report on the identification of an unusual brucella-like strain  isolated from a lung biopsy in a 52-year-old patient in australia with a clinical history of chronic destructive pneumonia.


RESULTS
standard biochemical profiles confirmed that the unusual strain was a member of the brucella genus and the full-length 16s rrna gene sequence was 100% identical to the recently identified b. inopinata sp. nov. . additional sequence analysis of the reca, omp2a and 2b genes; and multiple locus sequence analysis  demonstrated that strain bo <dig> exhibited significant similarity to the b. inopinata sp. compared to any of the other brucella or ochrobactrum species. genotyping based on multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis  established that the bo <dig> and bo1tstrains form a distinct phylogenetic cluster separate from the other brucella spp.


CONCLUSIONS
based on these molecular and microbiological characterizations, we propose that the bo <dig> strain is a novel lineage of the newly described b. inopinata species.
