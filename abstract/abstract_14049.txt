BACKGROUND
msx originated early in animal evolution and is implicated in human genetic disorders. to reconstruct the functional evolution of msx and inform the study of human mutations, we analyzed the phylogeny and synteny of  <dig> metazoan msx proteins and tracked the duplication, diversification and loss of conserved motifs.


RESULTS
vertebrate msx sequences sort into distinct msx <dig>  msx <dig> and msx <dig> clades. the sister-group relationship between msx <dig> and msx <dig> reflects their derivation from the 4p/5q chromosomal paralogon, a derivative of the original "metahox" cluster. we demonstrate physical linkage between msx and other metahox genes  in a cnidarian. seven conserved domains, including two groucho repression domains , were present in the ancestral msx. in cnidarians, the groucho domains are highly similar. in vertebrate msx <dig>  the n-terminal groucho domain is conserved, while the c-terminal domain diverged substantially, implying a novel function. in vertebrate msx <dig> and msx <dig>  the c-terminal domain was lost. msx <dig> mutations associated with ectodermal dysplasia or orofacial clefting disorders map to conserved domains in a non-random fashion.


CONCLUSIONS
msx originated from a metahox ancestor that also gave rise to tlx, demox, nk, and possibly ehgbox, hox and parahox genes. duplication, divergence or loss of domains played a central role in the functional evolution of msx. duplicated domains allow pleiotropically expressed proteins to evolve new functions without disrupting existing interaction networks. human missense sequence variants reside within evolutionarily conserved domains, likely disrupting protein function. this phylogenomic evaluation of candidate disease markers will inform clinical and functional studies.
