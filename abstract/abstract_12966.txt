BACKGROUND
we have developed a new computational algorithm, shape-it, to infer haplotypes under the genetic model of coalescence with recombination developed by stephens et al in phase v <dig> . it runs much faster than phase v <dig>  while exhibiting the same accuracy. the major algorithmic improvements rely on the use of binary trees to represent the sets of candidate haplotypes for each individual. these binary tree representations:  speed up the computations of posterior probabilities of the haplotypes by avoiding the redundant operations made in phase v <dig> , and  overcome the exponential aspect of the haplotypes inference problem by the smart exploration of the most plausible pathways  in the binary trees.


RESULTS
our results show that shape-it is several orders of magnitude faster than phase v <dig>  while being as accurate. for instance, shape-it runs  <dig> times faster than phase v <dig>  to compute the haplotypes of  <dig> subjects on  <dig>  segments of  <dig> snps extracted from a standard illumina  <dig> k chip . we also compared shape-it with other widely used software, gerbil, pl-em, fastphase, 2snp, and ishape in various tests: shape-it and phase v <dig>  were the most accurate in all cases, followed by ishape and fastphase. as a matter of speed, shape-it was faster than ishape and fastphase for datasets smaller than  <dig> snps, but fastphase became faster -but still less accurate- to infer haplotypes on larger snp datasets.


CONCLUSIONS
shape-it deserves to be extensively used for regular haplotype inference but also in the context of the new high-throughput genotyping chips since it permits to fit the genetic model of phase v <dig>  on large datasets. this new algorithm based on tree representations could be used in other hmm-based haplotype inference software and may apply more largely to other fields using hmm.
