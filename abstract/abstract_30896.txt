BACKGROUND
phalaenopsis orchids are popular floral crops, and development of new cultivars is economically important to floricultural industries worldwide. analysis of orchid genes could facilitate orchid improvement. bacterial artificial chromosome  end sequences  can provide the first glimpses into the sequence composition of a novel genome and can yield molecular markers for use in genetic mapping and breeding.


RESULTS
we used two bac libraries  of phalaenopsis equestris to generate pair-end sequences from  <dig>  bac clones , at a success rate of  <dig> %. a total of  <dig>  bess were generated, representing  <dig>  mb, or about  <dig> % of the phalaenopsis genome. the trimmed sequences ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  base pairs  in size, with an average edited read length of  <dig> bp. when these bess were subjected to sequence homology searches, it was found that  <dig>  were predicted to represent protein-encoding regions, whereas  <dig>   contained repetitive dna. most of the repetitive dna sequences were gypsy- and copia-like retrotransposons , whereas only  <dig> % were dna transposons. further,  <dig> potential simple sequence repeats  were discovered. dinucleotides were the most abundant repeat motifs; at/ta dimer repeats were the most frequent ssrs, representing  <dig>  of all identified ssrs. microsynteny analysis revealed that more bess mapped to the whole-genome sequences of poplar than to those of grape or arabidopsis, and even fewer mapped to the rice genome. this work will facilitate analysis of the phalaenopsis genome, and will help clarify similarities and differences in genome composition between orchids and other plant species.


CONCLUSIONS
using bes analysis, we obtained an overview of the phalaenopsis genome in terms of gene abundance, the presence of repetitive dna and ssr markers, and the extent of microsynteny with other plant species. this work provides a basis for future physical mapping of the phalaenopsis genome and advances our knowledge thereof.
