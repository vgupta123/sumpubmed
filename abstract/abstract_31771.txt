BACKGROUND
secretion stress is caused by compromised folding, modification or transport of proteins in the secretory pathway. in fungi, induction of genes in response to secretion stress is mediated mainly by the unfolded protein response  pathway. this study aims at uncovering transcriptional responses occurring in the filamentous fungi trichoderma reesei exposed to secretion stress and comparing these to those found in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.


RESULTS
chemostat cultures of t. reesei expressing human tissue plasminogen activator  and batch bioreactor cultures treated with dithiothreitol  to prevent correct protein folding were analysed with cdna subtraction and cdna-amplified fragment length polymorphism  experiments. ests corresponding to  <dig> unique genes putatively induced under secretion stress were isolated and the expression pattern of  <dig> genes was confirmed by northern analysis. expression of these genes was also studied in a strain over-expressing inositol-requiring enzyme  <dig>  protein, a sensor for the upr pathway. to compare the data with that of s. cerevisiae, published transcriptome profiling data on various stress responses in s. cerevisiae was reanalysed. the genes up-regulated in response to secretion stress included a large number of secretion related genes in both organisms. in addition, analysis of t. reesei revealed up regulation of the cpc <dig> transcription factor gene and nucleosomal genes. the induction of the cpca and histone gene h <dig> were shown to be induced also in cultures of aspergillus nidulans treated with dtt.


CONCLUSIONS
analysis of the genes induced under secretion stress has revealed novel features in the stress response in t. reesei and in filamentous fungi. we have demonstrated that in addition to the previously rather well characterised induction of genes for many er proteins or secretion related proteins also other types of responses exist.
