BACKGROUND
several strain-specific klebsiella pneumoniae virulence determinants have been described, though these have almost exclusively been linked with hypervirulent liver abscess-associated strains. through pcr interrogation of integration hotspots, chromosome walking, island-tagging and fosmid-based marker rescue we captured and sequenced kpgi- <dig>  a novel genomic island integrated into the met <dig> trna gene of k. pneumoniae kr <dig>  a bloodstream isolate from a patient with pneumonia and neutropenic sepsis.


RESULTS
the  <dig>  kb kpgi- <dig> island exhibited a genome-anomalous g + c content, possessed near-perfect  <dig> bp direct repeats, encoded a γ1-chaperone/usher fimbrial cluster  and harboured seven other predicted genes of unknown function. transcriptional analysis demonstrated expression of three fim <dig> genes, and suggested that the fim2a-fim2k cluster comprised an operon. as fimbrial systems are frequently implicated in pathogenesis, we examined the role of fim <dig> by analysing kr <dig>  a streptomycin-resistant derivative of kr <dig>  and three isogenic mutants  using biofilm assays, human cell adhesion assays and pair-wise competition-based murine models of intestinal colonization, lung infection and ascending urinary tract infection. although no statistically significant role for fim <dig> was demonstrable, liver and kidney cfu counts for lung and urinary tract infection models, respectively, hinted at an ordered gradation of virulence: kr <dig> , kr2107∆fim <dig>  kr2107∆fim and kr2107∆fim∆fim <dig> . thus, despite lack of statistical evidence there was a suggestion that fim and fim <dig> contribute additively to virulence in these murine infection models. however, further studies would be necessary to substantiate this hypothesis.


CONCLUSIONS
although fim <dig> was present in 13% of klebsiella spp. strains investigated, no obvious in vitro or in vivo role for the locus was identified, although there were subtle hints of involvement in urovirulence and bacterial dissemination from the respiratory tract. based on our findings and on parallels with other fimbrial systems, we propose that fim <dig> has the potential to contribute beneficially to pathogenesis and/or environmental persistence of klebsiella strains, at least under specific yet-to-be identified conditions.
