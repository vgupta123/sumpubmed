BACKGROUND
e. coli o <dig> is a bacterial pathogen that is shed by cattle and can cause severe disease in humans. phage type  21/ <dig> is a subtype of e. coli o <dig> that is found across scotland and is associated with particularly severe human morbidity.

methods
a cross-sectional survey of scottish cattle farms was conducted in the period feb 2002-feb  <dig> to determine the prevalence of e. coli o <dig> in cattle herds. data from  <dig> farms on which e. coli o <dig> was present were analysed using generalised linear mixed models to identify risk factors for the presence of pt 21/ <dig> specifically.


RESULTS
the analysis identified private water supply, and northerly farm location as risk factors for pt 21/ <dig> presence. there was a significant association between the presence of pt 21/ <dig> and an increased number of e. coli o <dig> positive pat samples from a farm, and pt 21/ <dig> was significantly associated with larger e. coli o <dig> counts than non-pt 21/ <dig> e. coli o <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
pt 21/ <dig> has significant risk factors that distinguish it from other phage types of e. coli o <dig>  this finding has implications for the control of e. coli o <dig> as a whole and suggests that control could be tailored to target the locally dominant pt.
