BACKGROUND
the human zinc finger protein  <dig>  is a member of the scan domain family of kr√ºppel-like zinc finger transcription factors. znf <dig> shows 94% identity to its mouse homologue zinc finger protein  <dig>  which is the most highly conserved among the human-mouse scan family member orthologues pairs. zfp <dig> is widely expressed during early embryogenesis and in adult organs. moreover, zfp191-/- embryos have been shown to be severely retarded in development and die approximately at embryonic day e <dig> . znf <dig> can specifically interact with the widespread tcat motif which constitutes the humth <dig> microsatellite in the tyrosine hydroxylase  gene. allelic variations of humth <dig> have been stated to have a quantitative silencing effect on th gene expression and to correlate with quantitative and qualitative changes in the binding by znf <dig>  in addition, znf <dig> displays a suppressive effect on the transcription; however, little downstream targets have identified.


RESULTS
we searched for znf <dig> target genes by using a transient overexpression and knockdown strategy in the human embryo kidney  cells. microarray analyses identified  <dig> genes modulated by overexpression of znf <dig> and  <dig> genes regulated by knockdown of znf <dig>  using a threshold of  <dig> -fold. several interested candidate genes, validated by real time rt-pcr, were correlated well with the array data. interestingly,  <dig> genes were identified in both transient overexpression and transient knockdown strategies. the genmapp and mappfinder software packages were further used for pathway analysis of these significantly altered genes. several gene pathways were found to be involved in processes of the regulation of kinase activity, transcription, angiogenesis, brain development and response to dna damage.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis reveals for the first time that znf <dig> is a pleiotropic factor that has a role in hematopoiesis, brain development and cancers.
