BACKGROUND
exon arrays provide a way to measure the expression of different isoforms of genes in an organism. most of the procedures to deal with these arrays are focused on gene expression or on exon expression. although the only biological analytes that can be properly assigned a concentration are transcripts, there are very few algorithms that focus on them. the reason is that previously developed summarization methods do not work well if applied to transcripts. in addition, gene structure prediction, i.e., the correspondence between probes and novel isoforms, is a field which is still unexplored.


RESULTS
we have modified and adapted a previous algorithm to take advantage of the special characteristics of the affymetrix exon arrays. the structure and concentration of transcripts -some of them possibly unknown- in microarray experiments were predicted using this algorithm. simulations showed that the suggested modifications improved both specificity  and sensitivity  of the predictions. the algorithm was also applied to different real datasets showing its effectiveness and the concordance with pcr validated results.


CONCLUSIONS
the proposed algorithm shows a substantial improvement in the performance over the previous version. this improvement is mainly due to the exploitation of the redundancy of the affymetrix exon arrays. an r-package of space with the updated algorithms have been developed and is freely available.
