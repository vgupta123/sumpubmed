BACKGROUND
the metabolic network is an aggregation of enzyme catalyzed reactions that converts one compound to another. paths in a metabolic network are a sequence of enzymes that describe how a chemical compound of interest can be produced in a biological system. as the number of such paths is quite large, many methods have been developed to score paths so that the k-shortest paths represent the set of paths that are biologically meaningful or efficient. however, these approaches do not consider whether the sequence of enzymes can be manufactured in the same pathway/species/localization. as a result, a predicted sequence might consist of groups of enzymes that operate in distinct pathway/species/localization and may not truly reflect the events occurring within cell.


RESULTS
we propose a path weighting method cmpf  to search for routes in a metabolic network which minimizes pathway switching. in biological terms, a pathway is a series of chemical reactions which define a specific function . we conjecture that routes that cross many pathways are inefficient since different pathways define different metabolic functions. in addition, native routes are also well characterized within pathways, suggesting that reasonable paths should not involve too many pathway switches. our method can be generalized when reactions participate in a class set  so that the paths predicted have minimal class crossings.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that our method generates k-paths that involve the least number of class switching. in addition, we also show that native paths are recoverable and alternative paths deviates less from native paths compared to other methods. this suggests that paths ranked by our method could be a way to predict paths that are likely to occur in biological systems.
