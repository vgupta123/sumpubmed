BACKGROUND
although plasmid dna encoding an antigen from pathogens or tumor cells has been widely studied as vaccine, the use of plasmid vector  as therapeutic agent requires further investigation.


RESULTS
here, we showed that plasmid dna  at low doses inhibits the production of il- <dig> and tnf-α by lipopolysaccharide -stimulated macrophage cell line j <dig>  these findings led us to evaluate whether plasmid dna could act as an anti-inflammatory agent in a wistar rat endotoxemia model. rats injected simultaneously with  <dig>  mg/kg of lps and  <dig> or  <dig> μg of plasmid dna had a remarkable attenuation of mean arterial blood pressure  drop at  <dig> hours after treatment when compared with rats injected with lps only. the beneficial effect of the plasmid dna on map was associated with decreased expression of il- <dig> in liver and increased concentration of plasma vasopressin , a known vasoconstrictor that has been investigated in hemorrhagic shock management. no difference was observed in relation to nitric oxide  production.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate for the first time that plasmid dna vector at low doses presents anti-inflammatory property and constitutes a novel approach with therapeutic potential in inflammatory diseases.
