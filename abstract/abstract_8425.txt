BACKGROUND
the ubiquitous, non-proteinaceous amino acid gaba  accumulates in plants subjected to abiotic stresses such as chilling, o <dig> deficiency and elevated co <dig>  recent evidence indicates that controlled atmosphere storage causes the accumulation of gaba in apple  fruit, and now there is increasing interest in the biochemical mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon. here, we investigated whether this phenomenon could be mediated via ca2+/calmodulin  activation of glutamate decarboxylase  activity.


RESULTS
gad activity in cell-free extracts of apple fruit was stimulated by ca2+/cam at physiological ph, but not at the acidic ph optimum. based on bioinformatics analysis of the apple genome, three apple gad genes were identified and their expression determined in various apple organs, including fruit. like recombinant arabidopsis gad <dig>  the activity and spectral properties of recombinant mdgad <dig> and mdgad <dig> were regulated by ca2+/cam at physiological ph and both enzymes possessed a highly conserved cam-binding domain that was autoinhibitory. in contrast, the activity and spectral properties of recombinant mdgad <dig> were not affected by ca2+/cam and they were much less sensitive to ph than mdgad <dig>  mdgad <dig> and arabidopsis gad1; furthermore, the c-terminal region neither bound cam nor functioned as an autoinhibitory domain.


CONCLUSIONS
plant gads typically differ from microbial and animal gad enzymes in possessing a c-terminal 30– <dig> amino acid residue cam-binding domain. to date, rice gad <dig> is the only exception to this generalization; notably, the c-terminal region of this enzyme still functions as an autoinhibitory domain. in the present study, apple fruit were found to contain two cam-dependent gads, as well as a novel cam-independent gad that does not possess a c-terminal autoinhibitory domain.
