BACKGROUND
array genomic hybridization is being used clinically to detect pathogenic copy number variants in children with intellectual disability and other birth defects. however, there is no agreement regarding the kind of array, the distribution of probes across the genome, or the resolution that is most appropriate for clinical use.


RESULTS
we performed  <dig> k affymetrix genechip® array genomic hybridization in  <dig> idiopathic intellectual disability trios, each comprised of a child with intellectual disability of unknown cause and both unaffected parents. we found pathogenic genomic imbalance in  <dig> of these  <dig> individuals with idiopathic intellectual disability. in comparison, we had found pathogenic genomic imbalance in  <dig> of  <dig> children with idiopathic intellectual disability in a previous cohort who had been studied by  <dig> k genechip® array genomic hybridization. among  <dig> intellectual disability trios selected from the previous cohort who were re-tested with  <dig> k genechip® array genomic hybridization, we identified all  <dig> previously-detected pathogenic genomic alterations and at least one additional pathogenic copy number variant that had not been detected with  <dig> k genechip® array genomic hybridization. many benign copy number variants, including one that was de novo, were also detected with  <dig> k array genomic hybridization, but it was possible to distinguish the benign and pathogenic copy number variants with confidence in all but  <dig>  of the  <dig> intellectual disability trios studied.


CONCLUSIONS
affymetrix genechip®  <dig> k array genomic hybridization detected pathogenic genomic imbalance in  <dig> of  <dig> patients with idiopathic developmental disability in whom  <dig> k genechip® array genomic hybridization had found genomic imbalance,  <dig> of  <dig> patients in whom  <dig> k genechip® array genomic hybridization had found no abnormality, and  <dig> of  <dig> patients who had not previously been tested. effective clinical interpretation of these studies requires considerable skill and experience.
