BACKGROUND
stromal derived factor , an alpha chemokine, is a widely known chemoattractant in the immune system. a growing body of evidence now suggests multiple regulatory roles for sdf- <dig> in the developing nervous system.


RESULTS
to investigate the role of sdf- <dig> signaling in the growth and differentiation of cortical cells, we performed numerous in vitro experiments, including gene chip and quantitative rt-pcr analysis. using sdf- <dig> medium and amd <dig>  a receptor antagonist, we demonstrate that the chemokine signaling regulates key events during early cortical development. first, sdf- <dig> signaling maintains cortical progenitors in proliferation, possibly through a mechanism involving connexin  <dig> mediated intercellular coupling. second, sdf- <dig> signaling upregulates the differentiation of cortical gabaergic neurons, independent of sonic signaling pathway. third, sdf- <dig> enables the elongation and branching of axons of cortical glutamatergic neurons. finally, cortical cultures derived from cxcr4-/- mutants show a close parallel to amd <dig> treatment with reduced cell proliferation and differentiation of gabaergic neurons.


CONCLUSIONS
results from this study show that sdf- <dig> regulates distinct cortical cell populations in vitro.
