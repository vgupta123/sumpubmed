BACKGROUND
amorphophallus is a genus of perennial plants widely distributed in the tropics or subtropics of west africa and south asia. its corms contain a high level of water-soluble glucomannan; therefore, it has long been used as a medicinal herb and food source. genetic studies of amorphophallus have been hindered by a lack of genetic markers. a large number of molecular markers are required for genetic diversity study and improving disease resistance in amorphophallus. here, we report large scale of transcriptome sequencing of two species: amorphophallus konjac and amorphophallus bulbifer using deep sequencing technology, and microsatellite  markers were identified based on these transcriptome sequences.


RESULTS
cdnas of a. konjac and a. bulbifer were sequenced using illumina hiseq™  <dig> sequencing technology. a total of  <dig>  non-redundant unigenes were assembled from about  <dig>  gigabases, and  <dig>  ssrs were identified in  <dig>  non-redundant unigenes. di-nucleotide ssrs were the most abundant motif , followed by tri- , tetra- , penta- , and hexa-nucleotides  repeats. the top di- and tri-nucleotide repeat motifs included ag/ct  and agg/cct , respectively. a total of  <dig>  primer pairs were designed for marker development. of these,  <dig> primers were synthesized and used for validation of amplification and assessment of polymorphisms in  <dig> individual plants. the total of  <dig> primer pairs yielded pcr amplification products, of which  <dig> were polymorphic. the number of alleles ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> and the polymorphism information content valued ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . genetic diversity analysis was done using  <dig> highly polymorphic ssr markers. a phenogram based on jaccard’s similarity coefficients was constructed, which showed a distinct cluster of  <dig> amorphophallus individuals.


CONCLUSIONS
a total of  <dig>  ssr markers have been identified in amorphophallus using transcriptome sequencing. one hundred and seventy-seven polymorphic markers were successfully validated in  <dig> individuals. the large number of genetic markers developed in the present study should contribute greatly to research into genetic diversity and germplasm characterization in amorphophallus.
