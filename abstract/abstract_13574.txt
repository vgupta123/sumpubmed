BACKGROUND
microarray technology is commonly used as a simple screening tool with a focus on selecting genes that exhibit extremely large differential expressions between different phenotypes. it lacks the ability to select genes that change their relationships with other genes in different biological conditions . we intend to enrich the above procedure by proposing a nonparametric selection procedure that selects differentially correlated genes.


RESULTS
using both simulations and resampling techniques, we found that our procedure correctly detected genes that were not differentially expressed but differentially correlated. we also applied our procedure to a set of biological data and found some potentially important genes that were not selected by the traditional method.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
microarray technology yields multidimensional information on the function of the whole genome. rather than treating intergene correlation as a nuisance to the traditional gene selection procedures which are essentially univariate, our method utilizes the rich information contained in the correlation as a new selection criterion. it can provide additional useful candidate genes for the biologists.
