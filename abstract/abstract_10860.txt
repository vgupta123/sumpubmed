BACKGROUND
embryogenesis is the process by which the embryo is formed, develops, and establishes developmental hierarchies of tissues. the recent advance in microarray technology made it possible to investigate the tissue specific patterns of gene expression and their relationship with tissue lineages. this study is focused on how tissue specific functions, tissue lineage, and cell differentiation are correlated, which is essential to understand embryonic development and organism complexity.


RESULTS
we performed individual gene and gene set based analysis on multiple tissue expression data, in association with the classic topology of mammalian fate maps of embryogenesis. for each sub-group of tissues on the fate map, conservatively, differentially and correlatively expressed genes or gene sets were identified. tissue distance was found to correlate with gene expression divergence. tissues of the ectoderm or mesoderm origins from the same segments on the fate map shared more similar expression pattern than those from different origins. conservatively expressed genes or gene sets define common functions in a tissue group and are related to tissue specific diseases, which is supported by results from gene ontology and kegg pathway analysis. gene expression divergence is larger in certain human tissues than in the mouse homologous tissues.


CONCLUSIONS
the results from tissue lineage and gene expression analysis indicate that common function features of neighbor tissue groups were defined by the conservatively expressed genes and were related to tissue specific diseases, and differentially expressed genes contribute to the functional divergence of tissues. the difference of gene expression divergence in human and mouse homologous tissues reflected the organism complexity, i.e. distinct neural development levels and different body sizes.
