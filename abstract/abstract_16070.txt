BACKGROUND
epstein-barr virus  infection immortalizes primary b cells in vitro and generates lymphoblastoid cell lines , which are used for several purposes in immunological and genetic studies. purinergic receptors, consisting of p2x and p2y, are activated by extracellular nucleotides in most tissues and exert various physiological effects. in b cells, especially ebv-induced lcls, their expression and function have not been well studied. we investigated the expression of p <dig> receptors on primary human b cells and lcls using the quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  method for revealing the gene expression profile of the p <dig> receptor subtypes and their changes during transformation.


RESULTS
the mrna transcripts of most p <dig> receptors were detected in primary b cells; the expression of p2x <dig> and p2x <dig> receptors was the lowest of all the p <dig> receptors. by contrast, lcls expressed several dominant p <dig> receptors – p2x <dig>  p2x <dig>  and p2y <dig> – in amounts similar to those seen in b cells infected with ebv for  <dig> weeks. the amount of most p <dig> subtypes in lcls or ebv-infected b cells was lower than in normal b cells. however, the amount of p2x <dig> receptor expressed in lcls was higher. protein expression was studied using western blotting to confirm the mrna findings for p2x <dig>  p2x <dig>  p2x <dig>  p2y <dig>  and p2y <dig> receptors. atp increased the intracellular free ca2+ concentration  by enhancing the ca2+ influx in both b cells and lcls in a dose-dependent manner.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings describe p <dig> receptor expression profiles and the effects of purinergic stimuli on b cells and suggest some plasticity in the expression of the p <dig> receptor phenotype. this may help explain the nature and effect of p <dig> receptors on b cells and their role in altering the characteristics of lcls.
