BACKGROUND
previous studies have shown that microrna precursors  have considerably more stable secondary structures than other native rnas  and artificial rna sequences. however, pre-mirnas with ultra stable secondary structures have not been investigated. it is not known if there is a tendency in pre-mirna sequences towards or against ultra stable structures? furthermore, the relationship between the structural thermodynamic stability of pre-mirna and their evolution remains unclear.


RESULTS
we investigated the correlation between pre-mirna sequence conservation and structural stability as measured by adjusted minimum folding free energies in pre-mirnas isolated from human, mouse, and chicken. the analysis revealed that conserved and non-conserved pre-mirna sequences had structures with similar average stabilities. however, the relatively ultra stable and unstable pre-mirnas were more likely to be non-conserved than pre-mirnas with moderate stability. non-conserved pre-mirnas had more g+c than a+u nucleotides, while conserved pre-mirnas contained more a+u nucleotides. notably, the u content of conserved pre-mirnas was especially higher than that of non-conserved pre-mirnas. further investigations showed that conserved and non-conserved pre-mirnas exhibited different structural element features, even though they had comparable levels of stability.


CONCLUSIONS
we proposed that there is a correlation between structural thermodynamic stability and sequence conservation for pre-mirnas from human, mouse, and chicken genomes. our analyses suggested that pre-mirnas with relatively ultra stable or unstable structures were less favoured by natural selection than those with moderately stable structures. comparison of nucleotide compositions between non-conserved and conserved pre-mirnas indicated the importance of u nucleotides in the pre-mirna evolutionary process. several characteristic structural elements were also detected in conserved pre-mirnas.
