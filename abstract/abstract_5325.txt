BACKGROUND
rhizopus oryzae is a zygomycete filamentous fungus, well-known as a saprobe ubiquitous in soil and as a pathogenic/spoilage fungus, causing rhizopus rot and mucomycoses.


RESULTS
carbohydrate active enzyme  annotation of the r. oryzae identified, in contrast to other filamentous fungi, a low number of glycoside hydrolases  and a high number of glycosyl transferases  and carbohydrate esterases . a detailed analysis of cazy families, supported by growth data, demonstrates highly specialized plant and fungal cell wall degrading abilities distinct from ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. the specific genomic and growth features for degradation of easily digestible plant cell wall mono- and polysaccharides , chitin, chitosan, Î²- <dig> -glucan and fungal cell wall fractions suggest specific adaptations of r. oryzae to its environment.


CONCLUSIONS
cazy analyses of the genome of the zygomycete fungus r. oryzae and comparison to ascomycetes and basidiomycete species revealed how evolution has shaped its genetic content with respect to carbohydrate degradation, after divergence from the ascomycota and basidiomycota.
