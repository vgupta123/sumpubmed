BACKGROUND
cultivated peanut  is an important crop worldwide, valued for its edible oil and digestible protein. it has a very narrow genetic base that may well derive from a relatively recent single polyploidization event. accordingly molecular markers have low levels of polymorphism and the number of polymorphic molecular markers available for cultivated peanut is still limiting.


RESULTS
here, we report a large set of bac-end sequences , use them for developing ssr  markers, and apply them in genetic linkage mapping. the majority of bess had no detectable homology to known genes  followed by sequences with similarity to known genes , and miscellaneous sequences  such as transposable element, retroelement, and organelle sequences. a total of  <dig>  ssrs were identified from  <dig>  bess. among these identified ssrs, dinucleotide  and trinucleotide  ssrs were predominant. the new set of  <dig>  ssrs as well as about  <dig>  published or unpublished ssrs were screened against two parents of a mapping population, generating  <dig> polymorphic loci. a genetic linkage map was constructed, consisting of  <dig> loci onto  <dig> linkage groups and covering a total of  <dig> . <dig> cm, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent loci. two markers related to resistance gene homologs  were mapped to two different groups, thus anchoring  <dig> rgh-bac contig and  <dig> singleton.


CONCLUSIONS
the ssrs mined from bess will be of use in further molecular analysis of the peanut genome, providing a novel set of markers, genetically anchoring bac clones, and incorporating gene sequences into a linkage map. this will aid in the identification of markers linked to genes of interest and map-based cloning.
