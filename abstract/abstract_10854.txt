BACKGROUND
arginase is significantly upregulated in the lungs in murine models of asthma, as well as in human asthma, but its role in allergic airway inflammation has not been fully elucidated in mice.


RESULTS
in order to test the hypothesis that arginase has a role in allergic airway inflammation we generated arginase i-deficient bone marrow  chimeric mice. following transfer of arginase i-deficient bm into irradiated recipient mice, arginase i expression was not required for hematopoietic reconstitution and baseline immunity. arginase i deficiency in bone marrow-derived cells decreased allergen-induced lung arginase by  <dig>  Â±  <dig> %. in contrast, arginase ii-deficient mice had increased lung arginase activity following allergen challenge to a similar level to wild type mice. bm-derived arginase i was not required for allergen-elicited sensitization, recruitment of inflammatory cells in the lung, and proliferation of cells. furthermore, allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and collagen deposition were similar in arginase-deficient and wild type mice. additionally, arginase ii-deficient mice respond similarly to their control wild type mice with allergen-induced inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, proliferation and collagen deposition.


CONCLUSIONS
bone marrow cell derived arginase i is the predominant source of allergen-induced lung arginase but is not required for allergen-induced inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness or collagen deposition.
