BACKGROUND
targeting induced local lesions in genomes  is a reverse genetics approach to directly identify point mutations in specific genes of interest in genomic dna from a large chemically mutagenized population. classical tilling processes, based on enzymatic detection of mutations in heteroduplex pcr amplicons, are slow and labor intensive.


RESULTS
here we describe a new tilling strategy in zebrafish using direct next generation sequencing  of 250bp amplicons followed by paired-end low-error  sequence analysis. by pooling a genomic dna library made from over  <dig>  n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea  mutagenized f <dig> fish into  <dig> equal pools of  <dig> fish, each with a unique illumina barcode, we reduce the complexity of the template to a level at which we can detect mutations that occur in a single heterozygous fish in the entire library. miseq sequencing generates  <dig> base-pair overlapping paired-end reads, and pele analysis aligns the overlapping sequences to each other and filters out any imperfect matches, thereby eliminating variants introduced during the sequencing process. we find that this filtering step reduces the number of false positive calls 50-fold without loss of true variant calls. after pele we were able to validate  <dig> % of the mutant calls that occurred at a frequency between  <dig> mutant call: <dig> wildtype calls and  <dig> mutant call: <dig> wildtype calls in a pool of  <dig> fish. we then use high-resolution melt analysis to identify the single heterozygous mutation carrier in the 288-fish pool in which the mutation was identified.


CONCLUSIONS
using this ngs-tilling protocol we validated  <dig> nonsense or splice site mutations in  <dig> genes, at a two-fold higher efficiency than using traditional cel <dig> screening. we conclude that this approach significantly increases screening efficiency and accuracy at reduced cost and can be applied in a wide range of organisms.
