BACKGROUND
allosteric disulfide bonds regulate protein function when they break and/or form. they typically have a -rhstaple configuration, which is defined by the sign of the five chi angles that make up the disulfide bond.


RESULTS
all disulfides in nmr and x-ray protein structures as well as in refined structure datasets were compared and contrasted for configuration and strain energy.


CONCLUSIONS
the mean dihedral strain energy of  <dig>  nmr structure disulfides was twice that of  <dig>  x-ray structure disulfides. moreover, the energies of all twenty types of disulfide bond was higher in nmr structures than x-ray structures, where there was an exponential decrease in the mean strain energy as the incidence of the disulfide type increased. evaluation of protein structures for which there are x-ray and nmr models shows that the same disulfide bond can exist in different configurations in different models. a disulfide bond configuration that is rare in x-ray structures is the -lhstaple. in nmr structures, this disulfide is characterised by a particularly high potential energy and very short Î±-carbon distance. the hiv envelope glycoprotein gp <dig>  for example, is regulated by thiol/disulfide exchange and contains allosteric -rhstaple bonds that can exist in the -lhstaple configuration. it is an open question which form of the disulfide is the functional configuration.
