BACKGROUND
lychas mucronatus is one scorpion species widely distributed in southeast asia and southern china. anything is hardly known about its venom components, despite the fact that it can often cause human accidents. in this work, we performed a venomous gland transcriptome analysis by constructing and screening the venom gland cdna library of the scorpion lychas mucronatus from yunnan province and compared it with the previous results of hainan-sourced lychas mucronatus.


RESULTS
a total of sixteen known types of venom peptides and proteins are obtained from the venom gland cdna library of yunnan-sourced lychas mucronatus, which greatly increase the number of currently reported scorpion venom peptides. interestingly, we also identified nineteen atypical types of venom molecules seldom reported in scorpion species. surprisingly, the comparative transcriptome analysis of yunnan-sourced lychas mucronatus and hainan-sourced lychas mucronatus indicated that enormous diversity and vastly abundant difference could be found in venom peptides and proteins between populations of the scorpion lychas mucronatus from different geographical regions.


CONCLUSIONS
this work characterizes a large number of venom molecules never identified in scorpion species. this result provides a comparative analysis of venom transcriptomes of the scorpion lychas mucronatus from different geographical regions, which thoroughly reveals the fact that the venom peptides and proteins of the same scorpion species from different geographical regions are highly diversified and scorpion evolves to adapt a new environment by altering the primary structure and abundance of venom peptides and proteins.
