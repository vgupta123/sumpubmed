BACKGROUND
ki <dig> index, tumor associated macrophages  and mast cells  are associated with malignancies in animal and human neoplasms including colorectal carcinomas . this has not been assessed in canine crc. given similar genetic abnormalities between human and canine crc, we assessed ki- <dig> and mitotic indices, tams and mc count  in canine crc . tams and mcc were compared with those in adenomas  and control .


RESULTS
ki- <dig> index in crc  was strongly correlated  with mitotic index . mcc was higher  in crc  than in adenomas  and control . the results suggest that ki- <dig> index and mcc are associated with malignancy in canine crc. higher average tams were counted in adenomas  and in crc  than in the control , although the differences were not significant .


CONCLUSIONS
ki- <dig> index, tams and mcc in canine crc were recorded for the first time in this study. ki- <dig> index and mcc are associated with malignancy in canine crc. quantitative assessment of mcs and ki- <dig> coupled with mitotic index and other clinical parameters may help in evaluating malignancy in canine crc. tams likely play a role in the development of canine colorectal tumors. further studies to determine the clinical significance of these parameters for prognostic, chemo-preventive and chemotherapeutic purposes in canine colorectal tumors are recommended.
