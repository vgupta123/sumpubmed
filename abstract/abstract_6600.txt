BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is a common human and animal opportunistic pathogen. in humans nasal carriage of s. aureus is a risk factor for various infections. methicillin-resistant s. aureus st <dig> is highly prevalent in pigs in europe and north america. the mechanism of successful pig colonization by mrsa st <dig> is poorly understood. previously, we developed a nasal colonization model of porcine nasal mucosa explants to identify molecular traits involved in nasal mrsa colonization of pigs.


RESULTS
we report the analysis of changes in the transcription of mrsa st <dig> strain s <dig> during colonization on the explant epithelium. major regulated genes were encoding metabolic processes and regulation of these genes may represent metabolic adaptation to nasal mucosa explants. colonization was not accompanied by significant changes in transcripts of the main virulence associated genes or known human colonization factors. here, we documented regulation of two genes which have potential influence on s. aureus colonization; cysteine extracellular proteinase  and von willebrand factor-binding protein . colonization with isogenic-deletion strains  did not alter the ex vivo nasal s. aureus colonization compared to wild type.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that nasal colonization with mrsa st <dig> is a complex event that is accompanied with changes in bacterial gene expression regulation and metabolic adaptation.
