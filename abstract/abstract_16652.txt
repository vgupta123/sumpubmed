BACKGROUND
the p2x <dig> receptor plays an important role in cytokine release during the inflammatory response in vivo. polymorphisms within the p2x <dig> receptor gene that lead to loss of receptor function may contribute to impaired cytokine release by immune cells. therefore, we investigated whether a known loss-of-function polymorphism  in the p2x <dig> receptor gene leads to alterations in cytokine release in response to atp.


RESULTS
an ex vivo whole blood model was used to induce an inflammatory reaction with the pro-inflammatory stimuli lps and pha . blood from n= <dig> subjects with the glu496ala p2x <dig> snp  and n= <dig> ‘wild-type’ subjects  was used.

addition of atp  to lps/pha-stimulated whole blood induced an increase in il-1β release in p2x7mut subjects, whereas decreased release was observed in p2x7wt subjects. decreased levels of il- <dig> and tnf-α in response to atp were shown in both p2x7mut and p2x7wt subjects, which was less pronounced in p2x7mut subjects. atp at  <dig> mm also significantly decreased levels of lactate dehydrogenase  in p2x7mut subjects compared to p2x7wt subjects.


CONCLUSIONS
the presence of the non-synonymous glu496ala loss-of-function polymorphism within the p2x <dig> receptor gene is likely to be of importance in the release of cytokines during inflammation. furthermore, this study suggests that carriers of the glu496ala loss-of-function polymorphism are protected against the cytotoxic effects of high atp-levels.
