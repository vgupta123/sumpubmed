BACKGROUND
the combination of time-lapse imaging of live cells with high-throughput perturbation assays is a powerful tool for genetics and cell biology. the mitocheck project employed this technique to associate thousands of genes with transient biological phenotypes in cell division, cell death and migration. the original analysis of these data proceeded by assigning nuclear morphologies to cells at each time-point using automated image classification, followed by description of population frequencies and temporal distribution of cellular states through event-order maps. one of the choices made by that analysis was not to rely on temporal tracking of the individual cells, due to the relatively low image sampling frequency, and to focus on effects that could be discerned from population-level behaviour.


RESULTS
here, we present a variation of this approach that employs explicit modelling by dynamic differential equations of the cellular state populations. model fitting to the time course data allowed reliable estimation of the penetrance and time of appearance of four types of disruption of the cell cycle: quiescence, mitotic arrest, polynucleation and cell death. model parameters yielded estimates of the duration of the interphase and mitosis phases. we identified  <dig> sirnas that induced a disruption of the cell cycle at reproducible times, or increased the durations of the interphase or mitosis phases.


CONCLUSIONS
we quantified the dynamic effects of the sirnas and compiled them as a resource that can be used to characterize the role of their target genes in cell death, mitosis and cell cycle regulation. the described population-based modelling method might be applicable to other large-scale cell-based assays with temporal readout when only population-level measures are available.
