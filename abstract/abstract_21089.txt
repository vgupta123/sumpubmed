BACKGROUND
mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the major events responsible for activation of neuronal cell death pathways during cerebral ischemia. trace element selenium has been shown to protect neurons in various diseases conditions. present study is conducted to demonstrate that selenium preserves mitochondrial functional performance, activates mitochondrial biogenesis and prevents hypoxic/ischemic cell damage.


RESULTS
the study conducted on ht <dig> cells exposed to glutamate or hypoxia and mice subjected to 60-min focal cerebral ischemia revealed that selenium  pretreatment  significantly attenuated cell death induced by either glutamate toxicity or hypoxia. the protective effects were associated with reduction of glutamate and hypoxia-induced ros production and alleviation of hypoxia-induced suppression of mitochondrial respiratory complex activities. the animal studies demonstrated that selenite pretreatment  ameliorated cerebral infarct volume and reduced dna oxidation. furthermore, selenite increased protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ coactivator 1alpha  and nuclear respiratory factor  <dig> , two key nuclear factors that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. finally, selenite normalized the ischemia-induced activation of beclin  <dig> and microtubule-associated protein  <dig> light chain 3-ii , markers for autophagy.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that selenium protects neurons against hypoxic/ischemic damage by reducing oxidative stress, restoring mitochondrial functional activities and stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis.
