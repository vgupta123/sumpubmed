BACKGROUND
retraction, atrophy and fatty infiltration are signs subsequent to chronic rotator cuff tendon tears. they are associated with an increased pennation angle and a shortening of the muscle fibers in series. these deleterious changes of the muscular architecture are not reversible with current repair techniques and are the main factors for failed rotator cuff tendon repair. whereas fast stretching of the retracted musculotendinous unit results in proliferation of non-contractile fibrous tissue, slow stretching may lead to muscle regeneration in terms of sarcomerogenesis. to slowly stretch the retracted musculotendinous unit in a sheep model, two here described tensioning devices have been developed and mounted on the scapular spine of the sheep using an expandable threaded rod, which has been interposed between the retracted tendon end and the original insertion site at the humeral head. traction is transmitted in line with the musculotendinous unit by sutures knotted on the expandable threaded rod. the threaded rod of the tensioner is driven within the body through a rotating axis, which enters the body on the opposite side. the tendon end, which was previously released  from its insertion site with a bone chip, was elongated with a velocity of 1â€‰mm/day.


RESULTS
after several steps of technical improvements, the tensioner proved to be capable of actively stretching the retracted and degenerated muscle back to the original length and to withstand the external forces acting on it.


CONCLUSIONS
this technical report describes the experimental technique for continuous elongation of the musculotendinous unit and reversion of the length of chronically shortened muscle.
