BACKGROUND
the milk-derived protein human casein alpha s <dig>  has recently been detected in blood cells and was shown to possess proinflammatory properties. in the present study, we investigated the effect of csn1s <dig> on the differentiation of monocytes.

methods
primary human monocytes were stimulated with recombinant csn1s <dig> and compared to cells stimulated with gm-csf/il- <dig> or m-csf/ifnγ. morphological changes were assessed by microscopy and quantification of surface markers of differentiation by facs analysis. phagocytic activity of csn1s <dig> stimulated cells was measured by quantification of zymosan labeled particle uptake. the role of mitogen activated protein kinases for csn1s1-induced differentiation of monocytes and proinflammatory cytokine expression was assessed by supplementation of specific inhibitors.


RESULTS
csn1s <dig> at a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml resulted in morphological changes  and aggregation of cells, comparable to changes observed in m-csf/ifnγ differentiated macrophages. surface marker expression was altered after  <dig> h with an upregulation of cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  in csn1s <dig> stimulated cells. csn1s <dig> treated cells showed a characteristic surface marker pattern for macrophages after  <dig> h of incubation  comparable to changes observed in m-csf/ifnγ treated monocytes. furthermore, phagocytic activity was increased  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold following stimulation with  <dig> μg/ml csn1s <dig> after  <dig> and  <dig> h, respectively. early gm-csf, but not gm-csf/il- <dig> induced differentiation of monocytes towards dendritic cells  was inhibited by addition of csn1s <dig>  finally, csn1s <dig> induced upregulation of cd <dig> was impeded by inhibition of erk1/ <dig>  while inhibition of the mitogen activated protein kinases jnk and p <dig> did not influence cellular differentiation. however, jnk and p <dig> inhibitors impeded csn1s <dig> induced secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines il-1b or il- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
csn1s <dig> skews in vitro differentiation of monocytes towards a macrophage-like phenotype. data is accumulating that functions of csn1s <dig> are beyond nutritional properties and include immunomodulatory effects.
