BACKGROUND
many studies have been published outlining the global effects of 17Î²-estradiol  on gene expression in human epithelial breast cancer derived mcf- <dig> cells. these studies show large variation in results, reporting between ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> genes regulated by e <dig>  with poor overlap.


RESULTS
we performed a meta-analysis of these expression studies, using the rank product method to obtain a more accurate and stable list of the differentially expressed genes, and of pathways regulated by e <dig>  we analyzed  <dig> time-series data sets, concentrating on response at 3- <dig> hrs  and at  <dig> hrs . we found > <dig> statistically significant probe sets after correction for multiple testing at 3- <dig> hrs, and > <dig> significant probe sets at  <dig> hrs. differentially expressed genes were examined by pathway analysis. this revealed  <dig> early response pathways, mostly related to cell signaling and proliferation, and  <dig> late response pathways, mostly related to breast cancer, cell division, dna repair and recombination.


CONCLUSIONS
our results confirm that meta-analysis identified more differentially expressed genes than the individual studies, and that these genes act together in networks. these results provide new insight into e <dig> regulated mechanisms, especially in the context of breast cancer.
