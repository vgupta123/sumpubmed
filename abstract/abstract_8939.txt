BACKGROUND
multilineage differentiation, immunomodulation and secretion of trophic factors render mesenchymal stromal cells  highly attractive for clinical application. human platelet derivatives such as pooled human platelet lysate  and thrombin-activated platelet releasate in plasma  have been introduced as alternatives to fetal bovine serum  to achieve gmp-compliance. however, whereas both phpl and tprp support similar proliferation kinetics of lipoaspirate-derived msc , only phpl significantly accelerates bone marrow-derived msc  expansion. to identify functionally bioactive factors affecting ex vivo msc expansion, a differential proteomic approach was performed and identified candidate proteins were evaluated within a bioassay.


RESULTS
two dimensional difference gel electrophoresis , maldi-tof analyses and complementary western blotting revealed  <dig> differential protein species.  <dig> candidate proteins occured at higher concentrations in phpl compared to tprp and  <dig> at higher concentrations in tprp. the candidate proteins fibrinogen and apolipoprotein a <dig> differentially affected la- and bm-msc proliferation.

in a second set of experiments, reference cytokines known to foster proliferation in fbs were tested for their effects in the human supplements. interestingly although these cytokines promoted proliferation in fbs, they failed to do so when added to the humanized system.


CONCLUSIONS
the differential proteomic approach identified novel platelet derived factors differentially acting on human msc proliferation. complementary testing of reference cytokines revealed a lack of stimulation in the human supplements compared to fbs. the data describe a new coherent approach to combine proteomic technologies with functional testing to develop novel, humanized, gmp-compliant conditions for msc expansion.
