BACKGROUND
ebola is a filovirus  that induces a highly communicable and deadly hemorrhagic fever. currently, there are no approved vaccines to treat fv infections. protection from fv infection requires cell mediated and humoral immunity. glycoprotein gp <dig>  fc zaire, a recombinant fv human fc fusion protein, has been shown to confer protection against mouse adapted zaire ebola virus. the present studies are focused upon identifying immunodominant epitopes using in silico methods and developing tetramers as a diagnostic reagent to detect cell mediated immune responses to gp <dig>  fc.

methods
the gp <dig>  ebola zaire sequence from the  <dig> outbreak was analyzed by both bimas and syfpeithi algorithms to identify potential immuno-dominant epitopes. several peptides were synthesized and screened in flow-based mhc stability studies. three candidate peptides, p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  were identified and, following immunization in balb/c mice, all three peptides induced ifn-γ as detected by elispot and intracellular staining.


RESULTS
significantly, p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> generated robust cytotoxic t-cell responses  as determined by a flow cytometry-based caspase assay. antigen specific cells were also detected, using tetramers. both p <dig> and p <dig> have sequence homology with highly conserved regions of several strains of fv.


CONCLUSIONS
in sum, three immunodominant sequences of the ebola gp <dig>  have been identified using in silico methods that may confer protection against mouse adapted ebola zaire. the development of tetramer reagents will provide unique insight into the potency and durability of medical countermeasure vaccines for known bioterrorism threat agents in preclinical models.
