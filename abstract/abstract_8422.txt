BACKGROUND
fatty liver is a major metabolic disorder in dairy cows and is believed to result in major economic losses in dairy farming due to decreased health status, reproductive performance and fertility. currently, the definitive means for diagnosing fatty liver is determining the fat content of hepatic tissue by liver biopsy, which is an invasive and costly procedure, making it poorly suited to dairy farms. therefore, the key aim of this study was to investigate the measurement of serum paraoxonase- <dig> , an enzyme exclusively synthesized by the liver, as a sensitive noninvasive biomarker for diagnosis of fatty liver in dairy cows.


RESULTS
a comparative cohort study using serum specimens from holstein–friesian dairy cows  was conducted. serum pon <dig>  activity and other biochemical and hematological parameters were measured. we found that serum pon <dig> activity was lower  in cows suffering from fatty liver. the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve  of pon <dig> activity for diagnosis of fatty liver was  <dig> – <dig>   which was higher than the auc-roc of aspartate aminotransferase , lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase , alkaline phosphatase , non-esterified fatty acids , beta-hydroxybutyrate , total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein  and low-density lipoprotein . we found that adding serum pon <dig> measurement to different batteries of serum diagnostic panels showed a combination of high sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value , negative predictive value , positive likelihood ratio , negative likelihood ratio , diagnostic odd ratio  and overall diagnostic accuracy in diagnosing fatty liver.


CONCLUSIONS
the present results indicate that addition of serum pon <dig> activity measurement to the biochemical profile could improve the diagnosis of fatty liver in dairy cows, which would have a considerable clinical impact and lead to greater profitability in the dairy industry.
