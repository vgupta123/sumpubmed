BACKGROUND
neonatal dried blood spots  represent an inexpensive method for long-term biobanking worldwide and are considered gold mines for research for several human diseases, including those of metabolic, infectious, genetic and epigenetic origin. however, the utility of dbs is restricted by the limited amount and quality of extractable biomolecules , especially for genome wide profiling. degradation of dna in dbs often occurs during storage and extraction. moreover, amplifying small quantities of dna often leads to a bias in subsequent data, particularly in methylome profiles. thus it is important to develop methodologies that maximize both the yield and quality of dna from dbs for downstream analyses.


RESULTS
using combinations of in-house-derived and modified commercial extraction kits, we developed a robust and efficient protocol, compatible with methylome studies, many of which require stringent bisulfite conversion steps. several parameters were tested in a step-wise manner, including blood extraction, cell lysis, protein digestion, and dna precipitation, purification and elution. dna quality was assessed based on spectrophotometric measurements, dna detectability by pcr, and dna integrity by gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analyses. genome scale infinium humanmethylation <dig> and locus-specific pyrosequencing data generated using the refined dbs extraction protocol were of high quality, reproducible and consistent.


CONCLUSIONS
this study may prove useful to meet the increased demand for research on prenatal, particularly epigenetic, origins of human diseases and for newborn screening programs, all of which are often based on dna extracted from dbs.
