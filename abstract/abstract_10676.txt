BACKGROUND
pax2;5; <dig> transcription factors play diverse roles in vertebrate and invertebrate organogenesis, including the development of the inner ear. past research has suggested various cochlear defects and some vestibular defects in pax <dig> null mice but the details of the cochlear defects and the interaction with other pax family members in ear development remain unclear.


RESULTS
we show that pax2; <dig> double null mice do not develop an ear past the otocyst stage and show little to no sensory as well as limited and transient neuronal development, thus indicating that these two family members are essential for overall ear morphogenesis and sustained neurosensory development. in support of functional redundancy between pax proteins, pax <dig> can be substituted by a pax <dig> minigene, a gene normally not expressed in the embryonic mouse ear. there is no detectable morphological defect in pax <dig> null mice suggesting that pax <dig> expression can compensate for pax <dig>  conversely, pax <dig> cannot compensate for pax <dig> leading to a cochlear phenotype not fully appreciated previously: cochlear development is delayed until e <dig>  when the cochlea extrudes as a large sack into the brain case. immunocytochemistry and tracing from the brain show that a cochlear spiral ganglia form as a small addition to the inferior vestibular ganglion. however, the empty cochlear sack, devoid of any sensory epithelium development as indicated by the absence of sox <dig> or myovii expression, nevertheless develop a dense innervation network of small neurons situated in the wall of the cochlear sack.


CONCLUSIONS
combined these data suggest that pax <dig> is needed for organ of corti formation and is directly or indirectly involved in the coordination of spiral ganglion formation which is partially disrupted in the pax <dig> null ears. all three pax genes can signal redundantly in the ear with their function being determined primarily by the spatio-temporal expression driven by the three distinct promoters of these genes.
