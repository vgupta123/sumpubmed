BACKGROUND
castration is one of the most common procedures performed on beef and dairy cattle. the objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of meloxicam oral suspension in reducing pain and inflammation in calves following band or surgical castration.

methods
two identical trials with the exception of the method of castration  were conducted. sixty  healthy holstein calves  <dig> to 5 months of age  were used. animals received either meloxicam oral suspension at a dose of 1 mg/kg bw  or saline  2 h before castration. physiological  and behavioral , accelerometers and tail pedometers) evaluations were conducted before  and after castration . inflammation was evaluated daily by providing an individual animal score  or with a measurement of scrotal thickness .


RESULTS
heart rates were significantly greater in control animals following band and surgical castration. plasma cortisol and substance p were significantly reduced in animals receiving meloxicam oral suspension. control animals had significantly greater vas scores. accelerometers showed that meloxicam treated animals had a significantly greater motion index and number of steps as well as less % time lying and number of lying bouts. the scrotal inflammation  was significantly decreased in the meloxicam treated animals compared to the control animals on day  <dig>  day  <dig> and  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
meloxicam oral suspension was able to significantly reduce the display of painful behaviors and physiological responses to pain in band castrated and surgical castrated calves for up to 72 h following a single oral treatment of 1 mg/kg body weight. meloxicam oral suspension was able to significantly reduce scrotal inflammation in band castrated and surgical castrated calves.
