BACKGROUND
phanerochaete chrysosporium, the model white rot basidiomycetous fungus, has the extraordinary ability to mineralize  lignin and detoxify a variety of chemical pollutants. its cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases have recently been implied in several of these biotransformations. our initial p <dig> cloning efforts in p. chrysosporium and its subsequent whole genome sequencing have revealed an extraordinary p <dig> repertoire  containing at least  <dig> p <dig> genes with yet unknown function. in order to understand the functional diversity and the evolutionary mechanisms and significance of these hemeproteins, here we report a genome-wide structural and evolutionary analysis of the p450ome of this fungus.


RESULTS
our analysis showed that p. chrysosporium p450ome could be classified into  <dig> families and  <dig> sub-families and is characterized by the presence of multigene families. a genome-level structural analysis revealed  <dig> organizationally homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters of tandem p <dig> genes. analysis of our cloned cdnas revealed structurally conserved characteristics  among members of the two representative multigene p <dig> families cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> . considering the unusually complex structural features of the p <dig> genes in this genome, including microexons  and frequent small introns , alternative splicing, as experimentally observed for cyp <dig>  may be a more widespread event in the p450ome of this fungus. clan-level phylogenetic comparison revealed that p. chrysosporium p <dig> families fall under  <dig> fungal clans and the majority of these multigene families appear to have evolved locally in this genome from their respective progenitor genes, as a result of extensive gene duplications and rearrangements.


CONCLUSIONS
p. chrysosporium p450ome, the largest known todate among fungi, is characterized by tandem gene clusters and multigene families. this enormous p <dig> gene diversity has evolved by extensive gene duplications and intragenomic recombinations of the progenitor genes presumably to meet the exceptionally high metabolic demand of this biodegradative group of basidiomycetous fungi in ecological niches. in this context, alternative splicing appears to further contribute to the evolution of functional diversity of the p450ome in this fungus. the evolved p <dig> diversity is consistent with the known vast biotransformation potential of p. chrysosporium. the presented analysis will help design future p <dig> functional studies to understand the underlying mechanisms of secondary metabolism and oxidative biotransformation pathways in this model white rot fungus.
