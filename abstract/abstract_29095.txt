BACKGROUND
members of the makorin  gene family encode ring/c3h zinc finger proteins with u <dig> ubiquitin ligase activity. although these proteins have been described in a variety of eukaryotes such as plants, fungi, invertebrates and vertebrates including human, almost nothing is known about their structural and functional evolution.


RESULTS
via partial sequencing of a testis cdna library from the poeciliid fish xiphophorus maculatus, we have identified a new member of the makorin gene family, that we called mkrn <dig>  in addition to the already described mkrn <dig> and mkrn <dig>  mkrn <dig> is the third example of a makorin gene present in both tetrapods and ray-finned fish. however, this gene was not detected in mouse and rat, suggesting its loss in the lineage leading to rodent murids. mkrn <dig> and mkrn <dig> are located in large ancient duplicated regions in tetrapod and fish genomes, suggesting the possible involvement of ancestral vertebrate-specific genome duplication in the formation of these genes. intriguingly, many mkrn <dig> and mkrn <dig> intronless retrocopies have been detected in mammals but not in other vertebrates, most of them corresponding to pseudogenes. the nature and number of zinc fingers were found to be conserved in mkrn <dig> and mkrn <dig> but much more variable in mkrn <dig>  with lineage-specific differences. rt-qpcr analysis demonstrated a highly gonad-biased expression pattern for makorin genes in medaka and zebrafish  and amphibians, but a strong relaxation of this specificity in birds and mammals. all three mkrn genes were maternally expressed before zygotic genome activation in both medaka and zebrafish early embryos.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis demonstrates that the makorin gene family has evolved through large-scale duplication and subsequent lineage-specific retroposition-mediated duplications in vertebrates. from the three major vertebrate mkrn genes, mkrn <dig> shows the highest evolutionary dynamics, with lineage-specific loss of zinc fingers and even complete gene elimination from certain groups of vertebrates. comparative expression analysis strongly suggests that the ancestral e <dig> ubiquitin ligase function of the single copy mkrn gene before duplication in vertebrates was gonad-specific, with maternal expression in early embryos.
