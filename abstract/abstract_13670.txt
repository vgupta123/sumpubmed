BACKGROUND
the role of hybridization in generating diversity in animals is an active area of discovery and debate. we assess hybridization across a contact zone of northern  and southern  red-backed voles using variation in skeletal features and both mitochondrial and nuclear loci. this transect extends approximately  <dig> km along the north pacific coast of north america and encompasses  <dig> populations . we establish the history, geographic extent and directionality of hybridization, determine whether hybridization is ongoing, and assess the evolutionary stability of novel genomic combinations.


RESULTS
identification of m. rutilus and m. gapperi based on the degree of closure of the post-palatal bridge was concordant with the distribution of diagnostic nuclear myh <dig> alleles; however, an  <dig> km zone of introgressed populations was identified. the introgressant form is characterized by having mitochondrial haplotypes closely related to the northern m. rutilus on a nuclear background and morphological characteristics of southern m. gapperi.


CONCLUSIONS
introgression appears to have been historic as pure populations of m. rutilus are now isolated to the north from introgressants or pure m. gapperi by the leconte glacier. as we do not find pure m. rutilus or m. gapperi individuals throughout the distribution of the introgressant form, it appears that the introgressants are a self-sustaining entity not requiring continued hybridization between pure parental forms to generate this novel combination of characters.
