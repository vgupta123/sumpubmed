BACKGROUND
previous studies on insect dna barcoding provide contradictory results and suggest not consistent performances across orders. this work aims at providing a general evaluation of insect dna barcoding and "mini-barcoding" by performing simulations on a large database of  <dig>  dna barcodes. we compared the proportions of correctly identified queries across a) six insect orders , b) four identification criteria , and c) reference databases with different taxon coverage .


RESULTS
analysis of variance revealed highly significant differences among id criteria and insect orders. a posteriori comparisons of means showed that njt had always a significantly lower identification success  compared to both bm and bcm . njt showed significant variations among orders, with the highest proportion of correctly identified queries in hymenoptera and orthoptera and the lowest in diptera. conversely, the proportions of correct matches of bm and bcm were consistent across orders but a progressive increase in false identification was observed when larger reference databases were used.


CONCLUSIONS
regardless the relatively low proportion of type i errors  of bm and bcm, the lack of reference dna barcodes for 98% of the known insect species implies that insect dna barcoding is heavily biased by type ii errors . the detrimental effects of type ii errors could be circumvented if insect dna barcoding is used to verify the lack of correspondence between a query and a list of properly referenced target species . this "negative identification" would only be subjected to type i errors and could be profitably adopted in insect quarantine procedures.
