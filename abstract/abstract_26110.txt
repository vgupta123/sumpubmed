BACKGROUND
red coloration of fruit is an important trait in apple, and it is mainly attributed to the accumulation of anthocyanins, a class of plant flavonoid metabolites. anthocyanin biosynthesis is genetically determined by structural and regulatory genes. plant tissue pigmentation patterns are mainly controlled by expression profiles of regulatory genes. among these regulatory genes are myb transcription factors , wherein the class of two-repeats  is deemed the largest, and these are associated with the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. although three mdmyb genes, almost identical in nucleotide sequences, have been identified in apple, it is likely that there are other r2r <dig> myb tfs that are present in the apple genome that are also involved in the regulation of coloration of red color pigmentation of the skin of apple fruits.


RESULTS
in this study, a novel r2r <dig> myb gene has been isolated and characterized in apple. this myb gene is closely related to the arabidopsis thaliana atmyb <dig>  and has been designated as mdmyb <dig>  this tf belongs to the subgroup  <dig> r2r <dig> family of plant myb transcription factors. this apple mdmyb <dig> gene is mapped onto linkage group  <dig> of the integrated apple genetic map. transcripts of mdmyb <dig> are detected in all analyzed tissues including leaves, flowers, and fruits. however, transcripts of mdmyb <dig> are higher in excocarp of red-skinned apple cultivars than that in yellowish-green skinned apple cultivars. when this gene is ectopically expressed in nicotiana tabacum cv. petite havana sr <dig>  flowers of transgenic tobacco lines carrying mdmyb <dig> have exhibited increased pigmentation and accumulate higher levels of anthocyanins and flavonols than wild-type flowers. overexpression of mdmyb <dig> has resulted in transcriptional activation of several flavonoid pathway genes, including chs, chi, ufgt, and fls. moreover, peduncles of flowers and styles of pistils of transgenic plants overexpressing mdmyb <dig> are longer than those of wild-type plants, thus suggesting that this tf is involved in regulation of flower development.


CONCLUSIONS
this study has identified a novel myb transcription factor in the apple genome. this tf, designated as mdmyb <dig>  is involved in transcriptional activation of several flavonoid pathway genes. moreover, this tf not only regulates the accumulation of anthocyanin in the skin of apple fruits, but it is also involved in the regulation of flower development, particularly that of pistil development.
