BACKGROUND
vertebrates show clear asymmetry in left-right  patterning of their organs and associated vasculature. during mammalian development a cilia driven leftwards flow of liquid leads to the left-sided expression of nodal, which in turn activates asymmetric expression of the transcription factor pitx <dig>  while pitx <dig> asymmetry drives many aspects of asymmetric morphogenesis, it is clear from published data that additional asymmetrically expressed loci must exist.


RESULTS
a l-r expression screen identified the cytoskeletally-associated gene, actin binding lim protein  <dig> , as asymmetrically expressed in both the node and left lateral plate mesoderm . lpm expression closely mirrors that of nodal. significantly, ablim <dig> lpm asymmetry was detected in the absence of detectable nodal. in the node, ablim <dig> was initially expressed symmetrically across the entire structure, resolving to give a peri-nodal ring at the headfold stage in a flow and pkd2-dependent manner. the peri-nodal ring of ablim <dig> expression became asymmetric by the mid-headfold stage, showing stronger right than left-sided expression. node asymmetry became more apparent as development proceeded; expression retreated in an anticlockwise direction, disappearing first from the left anterior node. indeed, at early somite stages ablim <dig> shows a unique asymmetric expression pattern, in the left lateral plate and to the right side of the node.


CONCLUSIONS
left lpm ablim <dig> is expressed in the absence of detectable lpm nodal, clearly revealing existence of a pitx <dig> and nodal-independent left-sided signal in mammals. at the node, a previously unrecognised action of early nodal flow and pkd <dig> activity, within the pit of the node, influences gene expression in a symmetric manner. subsequent ablim <dig> expression in the peri-nodal ring reveals a very early indication of l-r asymmetry. ablim <dig> expression analysis at the node acts as an indicator of nodal flow. together these results make ablim <dig> a candidate for controlling aspects of l-r identity and patterning.
