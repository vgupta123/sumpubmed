BACKGROUND
the eastern oyster, crassostrea virginica , is an economically important species cultured in many areas in north america. it is also ecologically important because of the impact of its filter feeding behaviour on water quality. populations of c. virginica have been threatened by overfishing, habitat degradation, and diseases. through genome research, strategies are being developed to reverse its population decline. however, large-scale expressed sequence tag  resources have been lacking for this species. efficient generation of est resources from this species has been hindered by a high redundancy of transcripts. the objectives of this study were to construct a normalized cdna library for efficient est analysis, to generate thousands of ests, and to analyze the ests for microsatellites and potential single nucleotide polymorphisms .


RESULTS
a normalized and subtracted c. virginica cdna library was constructed from pooled rna isolated from hemocytes, mantle, gill, gonad and digestive tract, muscle, and a whole juvenile oyster. a total of  <dig>  clones were sequenced from this library generating  <dig>  high-quality est sequences. cluster analysis indicated the presence of  <dig> contigs and  <dig>  singletons, generating a total of  <dig>  unique sequences. about 46%  of the unique ests had significant hits  to the non-redundant protein database;  <dig>  of which were annotated using gene ontology  terms. a total of  <dig> microsatellites were identified from the ests, with  <dig> having sufficient flanking sequences for primer design. a total of  <dig>  putative snps were also identified using all existing and the newly generated est resources of the eastern oysters.


CONCLUSIONS
a high quality normalized cdna library was constructed. a total of  <dig>  ests were generated representing  <dig>  unique sequences. putative microsatellite and snp markers were identified. these genome resources provide the material basis for future microarray development, marker validation, and genetic linkage and qtl analysis.
