BACKGROUND
although homology-based methods are among the most widely used methods for predicting the structure and function of proteins, the question as to whether interface sequence conservation can be effectively exploited in predicting protein-protein interfaces has been a subject of debate.


RESULTS
we studied more than  <dig>  pair-wise alignments of protein sequences from structurally characterized protein complexes, including both obligate and transient complexes. we identified sequence similarity criteria required for accurate homology-based inference of interface residues in a query protein sequence.

based on these analyses, we developed homppi, a class of sequence homology-based methods for predicting protein-protein interface residues. we present two variants of homppi:  nps-homppi , which can be used to predict interface residues of a query protein in the absence of knowledge of the interaction partner; and  ps-homppi , which can be used to predict the interface residues of a query protein with a specific target protein.

our experiments on a benchmark dataset of obligate homodimeric complexes show that nps-homppi can reliably predict protein-protein interface residues in a given protein, with an average correlation coefficient  of  <dig> , sensitivity of  <dig> , and specificity of  <dig> , when sequence homologs of the query protein can be reliably identified. nps-homppi also reliably predicts the interface residues of intrinsically disordered proteins. our experiments suggest that nps-homppi is competitive with several state-of-the-art interface prediction servers including those that exploit the structure of the query proteins. the partner-specific classifier, ps-homppi can, on a large dataset of transient complexes, predict the interface residues of a query protein with a specific target, with a cc of  <dig> , sensitivity of  <dig> , and specificity of  <dig> , when homologs of both the query and the target can be reliably identified. the homppi web server is available at http://homppi.cs.iastate.edu/.


CONCLUSIONS
sequence homology-based methods offer a class of computationally efficient and reliable approaches for predicting the protein-protein interface residues that participate in either obligate or transient interactions. for query proteins involved in transient interactions, the reliability of interface residue prediction can be improved by exploiting knowledge of putative interaction partners.
