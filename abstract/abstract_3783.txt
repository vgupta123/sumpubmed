BACKGROUND
identification of causal snps in most genome wide association studies relies on approaches that consider each snp individually. however, there is a strong correlation structure among snps that needs to be taken into account. hence, increasingly modern computationally expensive regression methods are employed for snp selection that consider all markers simultaneously and thus incorporate dependencies among snps.


RESULTS
we develop a novel multivariate algorithm for large scale snp selection using car score regression, a promising new approach for prioritizing biomarkers. specifically, we propose a computationally efficient procedure for shrinkage estimation of car scores from high-dimensional data. subsequently, we conduct a comprehensive comparison study including five advanced regression approaches  and a univariate approach  to determine the effectiveness in finding true causal snps.


CONCLUSIONS
simultaneous snp selection is a challenging task. we demonstrate that our car score-based algorithm consistently outperforms all competing approaches, both uni- and multivariate, in terms of correctly recovered causal snps and snp ranking. an r package implementing the approach as well as r code to reproduce the complete study presented here is available from
