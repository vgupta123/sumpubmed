BACKGROUND
congenital stationary night-blindness  is a recessive autosomal defect in low-light vision in appaloosa and other horse breeds. this condition has been mapped by linkage analysis to a gene coding for the transient receptor potential cation channel member  <dig> . trpm <dig> is normally expressed in the on-bipolar cells of the inner nuclear layer of the retina. down-regulation of trpm <dig> expression in csnb results from a transposon-like insertion in intron  <dig> of the trpm <dig> gene. stop transcription signals in this transposon significantly reduce trpm <dig> primary transcript levels in csnb horses. this study describes additional contributions by a second mutation of the trpm <dig> gene, the eca <dig>  <dig> , <dig> c > t snp, to down-regulation of transcription of the trpm <dig> gene in night-blind horses. this trpm <dig> snp introduces a consensus binding site for neuro-oncological ventral antigen  <dig>  protein in the primary transcript. nova- <dig> binding disrupts normal splicing signals, producing unstable, non-functional mrna transcripts.


RESULTS
retinal bipolar cells express both trpm <dig> and nova- <dig> proteins. in vitro addition of nova- <dig> protein retards electrophoretic migration of trpm <dig> rna containing the eca <dig>  <dig> , <dig> c > t snp. up-regulating nova- <dig> expression in primary cultures of choroidal melanocytes carrying the intron  <dig> snp caused an average log 2-fold reduction of ~ <dig>  of trpm <dig> mrna expression.


CONCLUSIONS
these finding suggest that the equine trpm <dig> snp can act independently to reduce survival of trpm <dig> mrna escaping the intron  <dig> transcriptional stop signals in csnb horses. coexistence and co-inheritance of two independent trpm <dig> mutations across  <dig> equine generations suggests a selective advantage for the apparently deleterious csnb trait.
