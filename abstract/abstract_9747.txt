BACKGROUND
elicobacter pylori infection is associated with several gastro-duodenal inflammatory diseases of various levels of severity. to determine whether certain combinations of genetic markers can be used to predict the clinical source of the infection, we analyzed well documented and geographically homogenous clinical isolates using a comparative genomics approach.


RESULTS
a set of  <dig> h. pylori genes was used to perform array-based comparative genomic hybridization among  <dig> french h. pylori strains associated with chronic gastritis , duodenal ulcers , intestinal metaplasia  or gastric extra-nodal marginal zone b-cell malt lymphoma . hierarchical cluster analyses of the dna hybridization values allowed us to identify a homogeneous subpopulation of strains that clustered exclusively with cagpai minus malt lymphoma isolates. the genome sequence of b <dig>  a representative of this malt lymphoma strain-cluster, was completed, fully annotated, and compared with the six previously released h. pylori genomes . b <dig> has the smallest h. pylori genome described thus far ; it contains the vacas2m <dig> allele and lacks the genes encoding the major virulence factors . comparative genomics led to the identification of very few sequences that are unique to the b <dig> strain . pair-wise genomic synteny comparisons between b <dig> and the  <dig> h. pylori sequenced genomes revealed an almost complete co-linearity, never seen before between the genomes of strain shi <dig>  and b <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these isolates are deprived of the main h. pylori virulence factors characterized previously, but are nonetheless associated with gastric neoplasia.
