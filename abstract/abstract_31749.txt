BACKGROUND
micrornas  are short non-coding regulatory rnas that control gene expression usually producing translational repression and gene silencing. high-throughput sequencing technologies have revealed heterogeneity at length and sequence level for the majority of mature mirnas . most isomirs can be explained by variability in either dicer <dig> or drosha cleavage during mirna biogenesis at 5’ or 3’ of the mirna . although isomirs have been described in different tissues and organisms, their functional validation as modulators of gene expression remains elusive. here we have characterized the expression and function of a highly abundant mir- <dig> 5’-trimming variant .


RESULTS
the analysis of small rna sequencing data in several human tissues and cell lines indicates that 5’-isomir- <dig> is ubiquitously detected and a highly abundant, especially in the brain. 5’-isomir- <dig> was found in ago- <dig> immunocomplexes and complementary approaches showed that 5’-isomir- <dig> interacted with different members of the silencing  complex. in addition, 5’-isomir- <dig> decreased the expression of five validated mir- <dig> targets, suggesting that it is a functional variant. both the binding to risc members and the degree of silencing were less efficient for 5’-isomir- <dig> compared with mir- <dig>  for some targets, both mir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig> significantly decreased protein expression with no changes in the respective mrna levels. although a high number of overlapping predicted targets suggest similar targeted biological pathways, a correlation analysis of the expression profiles of mir- <dig> variants and predicted mrna targets in human brains at different ages, suggest specific functions for mir-101- and 5’-isomir- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that isomirs are functional variants and further indicate that for a given mirna, the different isomirs may contribute to the overall effect as quantitative and qualitative fine-tuners of gene expression.
