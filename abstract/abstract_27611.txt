BACKGROUND
genome-wide gene-gene interaction analysis using single nucleotide polymorphisms  is an attractive way for identification of genetic components that confers susceptibility of human complex diseases. individual hypothesis testing for snp-snp pairs as in common genome-wide association study  however involves difficulty in setting overall p-value due to complicated correlation structure, namely, the multiple testing problem that causes unacceptable false negative results. a large number of snp-snp pairs than sample size, so-called the large p small n problem, precludes simultaneous analysis using multiple regression. the method that overcomes above issues is thus needed.


RESULTS
we adopt an up-to-date method for ultrahigh-dimensional variable selection termed the sure independence screening  for appropriate handling of numerous number of snp-snp interactions by including them as predictor variables in logistic regression. we propose ranking strategy using promising dummy coding methods and following variable selection procedure in the sis method suitably modified for gene-gene interaction analysis. we also implemented the procedures in a software program, episis, using the cost-effective gpgpu  technology. episis can complete exhaustive search for snp-snp interactions in standard gwas dataset within several hours. the proposed method works successfully in simulation experiments and in application to real wtccc  data.


CONCLUSIONS
based on the machine-learning principle, the proposed method gives powerful and flexible genome-wide search for various patterns of gene-gene interaction.
