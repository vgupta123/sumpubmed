BACKGROUND
heme oxygenase- <dig>  catalizes heme degradation, and is considered one of the most sensitive indicators of cellular stress. previous work in human fibroblasts has shown that ho- <dig> expression is induced by no, and that transcriptional induction is only partially responsible; instead, the ho- <dig> mrna half-life is substantially increased in response to no. the mechanism of this stabilization remains unknown.


RESULTS
in nih3t <dig> murine fibroblasts, no exposure increased the half-life of the ho- <dig> transcript from ~ <dig>  h to  <dig> h, while treatments with cdcl <dig>  naaso <dig> or h2o <dig> increased the half-life only up to  <dig> h. although poly tail shortening can be rate-limiting in mrna degradation, the ho- <dig> mrna deadenylation rate in no-treated cells was ~65% of that in untreated controls. in untreated cells, ho- <dig> poly removal proceeded until 30– <dig> nt remained, followed by rapid mrna decay. in no-treated cells, ho- <dig> deadenylation stopped with the mrna retaining poly tails 30– <dig> nt long. we hypothesize that no treatment stops poly tail shortening at the critical 30- to 50-nt length. this is not a general mechanism for the post-transcriptional regulation of ho- <dig> mrna. methyl methane sulfonate also stabilized ho- <dig> mrna, but that was associated with an 8-fold decrease in the deadenylation rate compared to that of untreated cells. another ho- <dig> inducer, cdcl <dig>  caused a strong increase in the mrna level without affecting the ho- <dig> mrna half-life.


CONCLUSIONS
the regulation of ho- <dig> mrna levels in response to cellular stress can be induced by transcriptional and different post-transcriptional events that act independently, and vary depending on the stress inducer. while no appears to stabilize ho- <dig> mrna by preventing the final steps of deadenylation, methyl methane sulfonate achieves stabilization through the regulation of earlier stages of deadenylation.
