BACKGROUND
voltage-gated na+ channel β <dig>  subunits are multi-functional proteins that play roles in current modulation, channel cell surface expression, cell adhesion, cell migration, and neurite outgrowth. we have shown previously that β <dig> modulates electrical excitability in vivo using a mouse model. scn1b null mice exhibit spontaneous seizures and ataxia, slowed action potential conduction, decreased numbers of nodes of ranvier in myelinated axons, alterations in nodal architecture, and differences in na+ channel α subunit localization. the early death of these mice at postnatal day  <dig>  however, make them a challenging model system to study. as a first step toward development of an alternative model to investigate the physiological roles of β <dig> subunits in vivo we cloned two β1-like subunit cdnas from d. rerio.


RESULTS
two β1-like subunit mrnas from zebrafish, scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig>  arise from alternative splicing of scn1ba. the deduced amino acid sequences of scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> are identical except for their c-terminal domains. the c-terminus of scn1ba_tv <dig> contains a tyrosine residue similar to that found to be critical for ankyrin association and na+ channel modulation in mammalian β <dig>  in contrast, scn1ba_tv <dig> contains a unique, species-specific c-terminal domain that does not contain a tyrosine. immunohistochemical analysis shows that, while the expression patterns of scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> overlap in some areas of the brain, retina, spinal cord, and skeletal muscle, only scn1ba_tv <dig> is expressed in optic nerve where its staining pattern suggests nodal expression. both scn1ba splice forms modulate na+ currents expressed by zebrafish scn8aa, resulting in shifts in channel gating mode, increased current amplitude, negative shifts in the voltage dependence of current activation and inactivation, and increases in the rate of recovery from inactivation, similar to the function of mammalian β <dig> subunits. in contrast to mammalian β <dig>  however, neither zebrafish subunit produces a complete shift to the fast gating mode and neither subunit produces complete channel inactivation or recovery from inactivation.


CONCLUSIONS
these data add to our understanding of structure-function relationships in na+ channel β <dig> subunits and establish zebrafish as an ideal system in which to determine the contribution of scn1ba to electrical excitability in vivo.
