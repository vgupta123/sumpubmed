BACKGROUND
digital gene expression  profiling has become an established tool to study rna expression. here, we provide an in-depth analysis of small rna dge profiles from two different rat strains  from six different rat tissues . we describe the expression patterns of known and novel micro rnas and piwi-interacting rnas.


RESULTS
we confirmed the expression of  <dig> known mirnas  and identified  <dig> mirnas homologous to known human or mouse mirnas, as well as  <dig> new rat mirnas. furthermore, we confirmed specific a to i editing in brain for mir-376a/b/c and identified mir- <dig> as a novel editing target. in accordance with earlier findings, we observed a highly tissue-specific expression pattern for all tissues analyzed. the brain was found to express the highest number of tissue-specific mirnas, followed by testis. notably, our experiments also revealed robust strain-specific differential mirna expression in the liver that is caused by genetic variation between the strains. finally, we identified two types of germline-specific pirnas in testis, mapping either to transposons or in strand-specific clusters.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the small rna compendium described here advances the annotation of small rnas in the rat genome. strain and tissue-specific expression patterns furthermore provide a strong basis for studying the role of small rnas in regulatory networks as well as biological process like physiology and neurobiology that are extensively studied in this model system.
