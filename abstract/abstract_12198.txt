BACKGROUND
krab-zfps  are vertebrate-restricted transcriptional repressors encoded in the hundreds by the mouse and human genomes. they act via an essential cofactor, kap <dig>  which recruits effectors responsible for the formation of facultative heterochromatin. we have recently shown that krab/kap <dig> can mediate long-range transcriptional repression through heterochromatin spreading, but also demonstrated that this process is at times countered by endogenous influences.

method
to investigate this issue further we used an ectopic krab-based repressor. this system allowed us to tether krab/kap <dig> to hundreds of euchromatic sites within genes, and to record its impact on gene expression. we then correlated this krab/kap1-mediated transcriptional effect to pre-existing genomic and chromatin structures to identify specific characteristics making a gene susceptible to repression.


RESULTS
we found that genes that were susceptible to krab/kap1-mediated silencing carried higher levels of repressive histone marks both at the promoter and over the transcribed region than genes that were insensitive. in parallel, we found a high enrichment in euchromatic marks within both the close and more distant environment of these genes.


CONCLUSIONS
together, these data indicate that high levels of gene activity in the genomic environment and the pre-deposition of repressive histone marks within a gene increase its susceptibility to krab/kap1-mediated repression.
