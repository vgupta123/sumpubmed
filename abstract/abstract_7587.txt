BACKGROUND
gene conversion depends upon the same factors that carry out more general process of homologous recombination, including homologous gene targeting and recombinational repair. among these are the rad <dig> paralogs, conserved factors related to the key recombination factor, rad <dig>  in chicken and other fowl, gene conversion  diversifies immunoglobulin variable region sequences. this allows gene conversion and recombinational repair to be studied using the chicken dt <dig> b cell line, which carries out constitutive gene conversion and provides a robust and physiological model for homology-directed repair in vertebrate cells.


RESULTS
we show that dt <dig> contains constitutive nuclear foci of the repair factors rad51d and xrcc <dig>  consistent with activated homologous recombination. single-cell imaging of a dt <dig> derivative in which the rearranged and diversifying immunoglobulin λr light chain gene is tagged with polymerized lactose operator, dt <dig> polylaco-λr, showed that rad51d and xrcc <dig> localize to the diversifying λr gene. colocalizations correlate both functionally and physically with active immunoglobulin gene conversion. ectopic expression of either rad51d or xrcc <dig> accelerated the clonal rate of gene conversion, and conversion tracts were significantly longer in rad51d than xrcc <dig> transfectants.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate direct functions of rad51d and xrcc <dig> in immunoglobulin gene conversion, and also suggest that modulation of levels of repair factors may be a useful strategy to promote gene correction in other cell types.
