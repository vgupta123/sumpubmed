BACKGROUND
sirt <dig>  a member of the nad+-dependent histone/protein deacetylase family, regulates genomic stability, metabolism, and lifespan. myh glycosylase and ape <dig> are two base excision repair  enzymes involved in mutation avoidance from oxidative dna damage. rad9–rad1–hus <dig>  checkpoint clamp promotes cell cycle checkpoint signaling and dna repair. ber is coordinated with the checkpoint machinery and requires chromatin remodeling for efficient repair. sirt <dig> is involved in dna double-strand break repair and has been implicated in ber. here we investigate the direct physical and functional interactions between sirt <dig> and ber enzymes.


RESULTS
we show that sirt <dig> interacts with and stimulates myh glycosylase and ape <dig>  in addition, sirt <dig> interacts with the 9-1- <dig> checkpoint clamp. these interactions are enhanced following oxidative stress. the interdomain connector of myh is important for interactions with sirt <dig>  ape <dig>  and 9–1– <dig>  mutagenesis studies indicate that sirt <dig>  ape <dig>  and hus <dig> bind overlapping but different sequence motifs on myh. however, there is no competition of ape <dig>  hus <dig>  or sirt <dig> binding to myh. rather, one myh partner enhances the association of the other two partners to myh. moreover, ape <dig> and hus <dig> act together to stabilize the myh/sirt <dig> complex. within human cells, myh and sirt <dig> are efficiently recruited to confined oxidative dna damage sites within transcriptionally active chromatin, but not within repressive chromatin. in addition, myh foci induced by oxidative stress and sirt <dig> depletion are frequently localized on mouse telomeres.


CONCLUSIONS
although sirt <dig>  ape <dig>  and 9-1- <dig> bind to the interdomain connector of myh, they do not compete for myh association. our findings indicate that sirt <dig> forms a complex with myh, ape <dig>  and 9-1- <dig> to maintain genomic and telomeric integrity in mammalian cells.
