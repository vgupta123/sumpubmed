BACKGROUND
the aryl hydrocarbon receptor  is a ligand-activated transcription factor  that mediates responses to  <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin . integration of tcdd-induced genome-wide ahr enrichment, differential gene expression and computational dioxin response element  analyses further elucidate the hepatic ahr regulatory network.


RESULTS
global chip-chip and gene expression analyses were performed on hepatic tissue from immature ovariectomized mice orally gavaged with  <dig> μg/kg tcdd. chip-chip analysis identified  <dig>  and  <dig> ahr enriched regions  at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs, respectively. enrichment density was greatest in the proximal promoter, and more specifically, within ±  <dig>  kb of a transcriptional start site . ahr enrichment also occurred distal to a tss , extending the potential gene expression regulatory roles of the ahr. although tf binding site analyses identified over-represented dre sequences within enriched regions, approximately 50% of all ahr enriched regions lacked a dre core . microarray analysis identified  <dig>  number of tcdd-responsive genes  >  <dig> ). integrating this gene expression data with our chip-chip and dre analyses only identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes that involved an ahr interaction at a dre. functional annotation analysis of differentially regulated genes associated with ahr enrichment identified overrepresented processes related to fatty acid and lipid metabolism and transport, and xenobiotic metabolism, which are consistent with tcdd-elicited steatosis in the mouse liver.


CONCLUSIONS
details of the ahr regulatory network have been expanded to include ahr-dna interactions within intragenic and intergenic genomic regions. moreover, the ahr can interact with dna independent of a dre core suggesting there are alternative mechanisms of ahr-mediated gene regulation.
