BACKGROUND
superantigens  of mouse mammary tumor viruses  play a crucial role in t cell selection in the thymus in a t cell receptor  vβ-specific manner and sags presented by b cells activate t cells in the periphery. the peripheral t cell repertoire is dynamically shaped by the steady induction of t cell tolerance against self antigens throughout the lifespan. we hypothesize that de novo somatic mutation of endogenous mmtv sags contributes to the modulation of the peripheral t cell repertoire.


RESULTS
sag coding sequences were cloned from the genomic dnas and/or cdnas of various tissues of female c57bl/6j mice. a total of  <dig> unique sag sequences  were identified from the genomic dnas of liver, lungs, and bone marrow, which are presumed to harbor only three endogenous mmtv loci . similarly,  <dig> unique sag sequences  were cloned from the cdnas of  <dig> different tissues. examination of putative tcr vβ specificity suggested that some of the sag isoforms identified in this study have vβ specificities different from the reference sags of mtv- <dig>  mtv- <dig>  or mtv- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the pool of diverse sag isoforms, generated by de novo somatic mutation, may play a role in the shaping of the peripheral t cell repertoire including the autoimmune t cell population.
