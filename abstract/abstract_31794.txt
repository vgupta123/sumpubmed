BACKGROUND
hemolytic uremic syndrome  leading to acute kidney failure, is a condition linked to the production of primarily shiga toxin  <dig>  by some e. coli serotypes. we have previously shown that stx <dig> a subunit-specific human monoclonal antibody  5c <dig>  and b subunit-specific humab 5h <dig> inhibit cultured cell death, and protect mice and piglets from fatal stx2-intoxication. we have also shown that 5h <dig> blocks binding of stx <dig> to its cell-surface receptor globotriaosyl ceramide , whereas stx <dig> when complexed with 5c <dig> binds gb <dig> with higher affinity than stx <dig>  the mechanism by which 5c <dig> neutralizes stx <dig> in vitro involves trapping of stx <dig> in the recycling endosomes and releasing it into the extracellular environment. because of the clinical implications associated with the formation of stx2/antibody complexes and the potential for trapping and clearance through a severely damaged kidney associated with hus, we investigated the likely site of stx2/antibody localization and clearance in intoxicated mice treated with antibody or placebo.


RESULTS
mice were injected with radiolabeled stx <dig>   <dig> hours after administration of 5c <dig>  5h <dig>  or phosphate buffered saline  and the sites of localization of labeled stx <dig>  were investigated  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours later. the liver recorded statistically much higher concentrations of labeled stx <dig> for groups receiving 5c <dig> and 5h <dig> antibodies after  <dig>   <dig> and 48â€‰hours, as compared with the pbs group. in contrast, highest levels of labeled stx <dig> were detected in the kidneys of the pbs group at all  <dig> sampling times. mice receiving either of the two humabs were fully protected against the lethal effect of stx <dig>  as compared with the fatal outcome of the control group.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that humabs 5c <dig> and 5h <dig> promoted hepatic accumulation and presumably clearance of toxin/antibody complexes, significantly diverting stx <dig> localization in the kidneys, the target of stx <dig> and the cause of hus. this is in contrast to the fatal outcome of the control group receiving pbs. the results also confirm earlier observations that both humabs are highly and equally protective against stx <dig> intoxication in mice.
