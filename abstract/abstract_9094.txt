BACKGROUND
the outermost layer of the bacterial surface is of crucial importance because it is in constant interaction with the host. glycopeptidolipids  are major surface glycolipids present on various mycobacterial species. in the fast-grower model organism mycobacterium smegmatis, gpl biosynthesis involves approximately  <dig> genes all mapping to a single region of  <dig> kb.


RESULTS
we have recently sequenced the complete genomes of two fast-growers causing human infections, mycobacterium abscessus  and m. chelonae . we show here that these two species contain genes corresponding to all those of the m. smegmatis "gpl locus", with extensive conservation of the predicted protein sequences consistent with the production of gpl molecules indistinguishable by biochemical analysis. however, the gpl locus appears to be split into several parts in m. chelonae and m. abscessus. one large cluster  comprises all genes involved in the synthesis of the tripeptide-aminoalcohol moiety, the glycosylation of the lipopeptide and methylation/acetylation modifications. we provide evidence that a duplicated acetyltransferase  in m. abscessus and m. chelonae has evolved through specialization, being able to transfer one acetyl at once in a sequential manner. there is a second smaller and distant  cluster of six genes involved in the synthesis of the fatty acyl moiety and its attachment to the tripeptide-aminoalcohol moiety. the other genes are scattered throughout the genome, including two genes encoding putative regulatory proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
although these three species produce identical gpl molecules, the organization of gpl genes differ between them, thus constituting species-specific signatures. an hypothesis is that the compact organization of the gpl locus in m. smegmatis represents the ancestral form and that evolution has scattered various pieces throughout the genome in m. abscessus and m. chelonae.
