BACKGROUND
enterobacter sakazakii is an emergent pathogen that has been associated with neonatal infections through contaminated powdered infant milk formula. the species was defined by farmer et al.  who described  <dig> biogroups according to the biochemical characterization of  <dig> strains. this present study compares genotypes  with the biochemical traits for  <dig> e. sakazakii strains.


RESULTS
analysis of partial 16s rdna sequences gave  <dig> well defined phylogenetic groups. cluster group  <dig> was composed of the majority of strains  and included biogroups 1– <dig>  7– <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  cluster  <dig> corresponded with biogroup  <dig> and cluster  <dig> with biogroups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  cluster group  <dig> comprised a new biogroup  <dig>  for the isolates in this study, the four dna cluster groups can be distinguished using the inositol, dulcitol and indole tests.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates an agreement between genotyping  and biotyping and describes a new biogroup of e. sakazakii.
