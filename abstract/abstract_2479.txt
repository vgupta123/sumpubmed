BACKGROUND
the processing of verbal fluency tasks relies on the coordinated activity of a number of brain areas, particularly in the frontal and temporal lobes of the left hemisphere. recent studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging  to study the neural networks subserving verbal fluency functions have yielded divergent results especially with respect to a parcellation of the inferior frontal gyrus for phonemic and semantic verbal fluency. we conducted a coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation  meta-analysis on brain activation during the processing of phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks involving  <dig> individual studies with  <dig> healthy volunteers.


RESULTS
for phonemic as well as for semantic verbal fluency, the most prominent clusters of brain activation were found in the left inferior/middle frontal gyrus  and the anterior cingulate gyrus. ba  <dig> was only involved in the processing of phonemic verbal fluency tasks, ba  <dig> and  <dig> in the processing of phonemic and semantic fluency tasks.


CONCLUSIONS
our comparison of brain activation during the execution of either phonemic or semantic verbal fluency tasks revealed evidence for spatially different activation in ba  <dig>  but not other regions of the lifg/lmfg  during phonemic and semantic verbal fluency processing.
