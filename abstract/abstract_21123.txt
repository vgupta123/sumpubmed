BACKGROUND
studies of symmetric structures have made important contributions to evolutionary biology, for example, by using fluctuating asymmetry as a measure of developmental instability or for investigating the mechanisms of morphological integration. most analyses of symmetry and asymmetry have focused on organisms or parts with bilateral symmetry. this is not the only type of symmetry in biological shapes, however, because a multitude of other types of symmetry exists in plants and animals. for instance, some organisms have two axes of reflection symmetry  or rotational symmetry . so far, there is no general method for the shape analysis of these types of symmetry.


RESULTS
we generalize the morphometric methods currently used for the shape analysis of bilaterally symmetric objects so that they can be used for analyzing any type of symmetry. our framework uses a mathematical definition of symmetry based on the theory of symmetry groups. this approach can be used to divide shape variation into a component of symmetric variation among individuals and one or more components of asymmetry. we illustrate this approach with data from a colonial coral that has ambiguous symmetry and thus can be analyzed in multiple ways. our results demonstrate that asymmetric variation predominates in this dataset and that its amount depends on the type of symmetry considered in the analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
the framework for analyzing symmetry and asymmetry is suitable for studying structures with any type of symmetry in two or three dimensions. studies of complex symmetries are promising for many contexts in evolutionary biology, such as fluctuating asymmetry, because these structures can potentially provide more information than structures with bilateral symmetry.
