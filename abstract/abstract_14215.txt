BACKGROUND
genome-wide association studies  with metabolic traits and metabolome-wide association studies  with traits of biomedical relevance are powerful tools to identify the contribution of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors to the etiology of complex diseases. hypothesis-free testing of ratios between all possible metabolite pairs in gwas and mwas has proven to be an innovative approach in the discovery of new biologically meaningful associations. the p-gain statistic was introduced as an ad-hoc measure to determine whether a ratio between two metabolite concentrations carries more information than the two corresponding metabolite concentrations alone. so far, only a rule of thumb was applied to determine the significance of the p-gain.


RESULTS
here we explore the statistical properties of the p-gain through simulation of its density and by sampling of experimental data. we derive critical values of the p-gain for different levels of correlation between metabolite pairs and show that b/ is a conservative critical value for the p-gain, where Î± is the level of significance and b the number of tested metabolite pairs.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that the p-gain is a well defined measure that can be used to identify statistically significant metabolite ratios in association studies and provide a conservative significance cut-off for the p-gain for use in future association studies with metabolic traits.
