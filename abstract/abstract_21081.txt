BACKGROUND
the risks during early growth on becoming overweight in adulthood are widely studied in humans. however, early-life predictive factors for canine adult overweight and obesity have not yet been studied.

to identify factors that may help explain the development of overweight and obesity at adulthood in dogs, a longitudinal study of 2 years was conducted in  <dig> female beagle dogs of the same age, sexual status, and raised under identical environmental conditions. by means of a hierarchical classification on principal components with the following quantitative values: fat-free mass , percentage fat mass and pelvic circumference at 2 years of age, three groups of dogs were established and were nominally named: ideal weight , slightly overweight  and overweight . with the aim of identifying predictive factors of development of obesity at adulthood parental characteristics, growth pattern, energy balance and plasma factors were analysed by logistic regression analysis.


RESULTS
at 24 months, the group compositions were in line with the body condition scores  values of the iw , the ow <dig>  and the ow <dig>  groups. logistic regression analysis permitted the identification of neonatal growth rate during the first 2 weeks of life  and bcs at 7 months as predictors for the development of obesity at adulthood. seventy percent of dogs with either gr2w >125% or with bcs > 6/ <dig> at 7 months belonged to the ow <dig> group. results from energy intake and expenditure, corrected for ffm, showed that there was a greater positive energy imbalance between  <dig> and 10 months for the ow <dig>  compared to the iw group.


CONCLUSIONS
this study expands the understanding of previously reported risk factors for being overweight or obese in dogs, establishing that   <dig> out of  <dig> of the studied dogs became overweight and  gr2w and bcs at 7 months of age could be used as predictive factors as overweight adult dogs in the ow <dig> group had higher values compared the other groups of dogs.
