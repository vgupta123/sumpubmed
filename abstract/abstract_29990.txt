BACKGROUND
the potential of mesenchymal stromal cells  to differentiate into functional bone forming cells provides an important tool for bone regeneration. the identification of factors that trigger osteoblast differentiation in mscs is therefore critical to promote the osteogenic potential of human mscs. in this study, we used microarray analysis to identify signalling molecules that promote osteogenic differentiation in human bone marrow stroma derived mscs.


RESULTS
microarray analysis and validation experiments showed that the expression of igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> was increased together with integrin alpha <dig>  during dexamethasone-induced osteoblast differentiation in human mscs. this effect was functional since we found that igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> enhanced the expression of osteoblast phenotypic markers and in vitro osteogenic capacity of hmscs. interestingly, we showed that downregulation of endogenous itga <dig> using specific shrna decreased igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expression in hmscs. conversely, itga <dig> overexpression upregulated igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expression in hmscs, which indicates tight crosstalks between these molecules. consistent with this concept, activation of endogenous itga <dig> using a specific antibody that primes the integrin, or a peptide that specifically activates itga <dig> increased igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expression in hmscs. finally, we showed that pharmacological inhibition of fak/erk1/2-mapks or pi3k signalling pathways that are enhanced by itga <dig> activation, blunted igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expression in hmscs.


CONCLUSIONS
the results show that itga <dig> is a key mediator of igf <dig> and igfbp <dig> expression that promotes osteoblast differentiation in human mscs, and reveal that crosstalks between itga <dig> and igf2/igfbp <dig> signalling are important mechanisms that trigger osteogenic differentiation in human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells.
