BACKGROUND
enteropathogenic escherichia coli  is an attaching and effacing  pathogen that possesses a type iii secretion system  encoded within the locus of enterocyte effacement . the lee is essential for a/e lesion formation and directs the secretion and translocation of multiple lee-encoded and non-lee encoded effector proteins into the cytosol of infected cells. in this study we used proteomics to compare proteins exported to the culture supernatant by wild type epec e2348/ <dig>  a Δespadb mutant and a Δescf t3ss mutant.


RESULTS
we observed that flagellin was consistently and strongly present in the secretome of wild type epec and the Δespadb mutant but present only weakly in the secretome of the Δescf mutant. given the ancestral relationship between the flagella export apparatus and virulence associated t3sss, we investigated whether flic could utilise the lee-encoded t3ss for export. in the absence of a functional flagella export apparatus, we showed that flic could be secreted by the lee-encoded t3ss and stimulate  tlr <dig> signalling but could not confer motility.


CONCLUSIONS
since the secretion of flic during a/e lesion formation would presumably be disadvantageous for the pathogen, we propose that virulence associated t3sss and flagella t3sss have evolved through a system of chaperones and complex regulatory pathways to be functional at different times to ensure that flic secretion does not occur during t3ss effector translocation.
