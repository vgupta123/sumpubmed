BACKGROUND
rnf <dig> is a recently discovered ring finger protein that is associated with hek293t cell viability and is overexpressed in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells. rnf <dig> owns a ring finger domain in c terminus and transmembrane domain in n terminus. however, the biological mechanism underlying rnf <dig> action remains unknown.


RESULTS
in this study, we characterized rnf <dig> both biochemically and intracellularly in order to gain an understanding of its biological role. rnf <dig> was identified as a new ubiquitin ligase that can ubiquitinate itself and undergoes degradation in a ring finger-dependent manner. from a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand  as an rnf122-interacting protein. to examine the interaction between caml and rnf <dig>  we performed co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization experiments using intact cells. what is more, we found that caml is not a substrate of ubiquitin ligase rnf <dig>  but that, instead, it stabilizes rnf <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
rnf <dig> can be characterized as a c3h2c3-type ring finger-containing e <dig> ubiquitin ligase localized to the er. rnf <dig> promotes its own degradation in a ring finger-and proteasome-dependent manner. rnf <dig> interacts with caml, and its e <dig> ubiquitin ligase activity was noted to be dependent on the ring finger domain.
