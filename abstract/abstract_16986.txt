BACKGROUND
recent work has shown that the chaperone resistant to inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase  is critical for the folding, maturation and functional expression of a variety of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. α <dig> nicotinic receptors can only assemble and functionally express in select lines of cells, provided that ric- <dig> is present. in contrast, α4β <dig> nicotinic receptors can functionally express in many cell lines even without the presence of ric- <dig>  depending on the cell line, ric- <dig> has differential effects on α4β <dig> receptor function – enhancement in mammalian cells but inhibition in xenopus oocytes. other differences between the two receptor types include nicotine-induced upregulation. when expressed in cell lines, α4β <dig> receptors readily and robustly upregulate with chronic nicotine exposure. however, α <dig> nicotinic receptors appear more resistant and require higher concentrations of nicotine to induce upregulation. could the coexpression of ric- <dig> modulate the extent of nicotine-induced upregulation not only for α <dig> receptors but also α4β <dig> receptors? we compared and contrasted the effects of ric- <dig> on assembly, trafficking, protein expression and nicotine-induced upregulation on both α <dig> and α4β <dig> receptors using fluorescent protein tagged nicotinic receptors and förster resonance energy transfer  microscopy imaging.


RESULTS
ric- <dig> increases assembly and cell surface trafficking of α <dig> receptors but does not alter α <dig> protein expression in transfected hek293t cells. in contrast, ric- <dig> does not affect assembly of α4β <dig> receptors but increases α <dig> and β <dig> subunit protein expression. acute nicotine  was sufficient to upregulate fret between α <dig> and β <dig> subunits. surprisingly, when ric- <dig> was coexpressed with α4β <dig> receptors nicotine-induced upregulation was prevented. α <dig> receptors did not upregulate with acute nicotine in the presence or absence of ric- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these results provide interesting novel data that ric- <dig> differentially regulates assembly and expression of different nicotinic receptor subunits. these results also show that nicotine-mediated upregulation of α4β <dig> receptors can be dynamically regulated by the presence of the chaperone, ric- <dig>  this could explain a novel mechanism why high affinity α4β <dig> receptors are upregulated in specific neuronal subtypes in the brain and not others.
