BACKGROUND
this study describes the pattern of ultrasonographic contrast enhancement of the pancreatic body and left lobe using a second-generation commercial contrast medium  in  <dig> clinically healthy cats.


RESULTS
following contrast medium administration, microbubbles were observed within the splenic artery. this was followed by an inflow of contrast medium into the pancreatic capillary beds, providing a uniformly contrast-enhanced pancreas at peak intensity . at the time of pi, a replenishment of the splenic and portal veins started and increased progressively during the wash-out phase. during the wash-out phase, the echogenicity of the pancreatic parenchyma decreased progressively. perfusion parameters included arrival time , time to peak from injection , time to peak from initial rise , peak intensity , and wash-in rate .


CONCLUSIONS
this perfusion pattern of normal pancreatic parenchyma may be useful for characterising cats with exocrine pancreatic disorders.
