BACKGROUND
oryza longistaminata, an aa genome type , originates from africa and is closely related to asian cultivated rice . it contains various valuable traits with respect to tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress, qtls with agronomically important traits and high ability to use nitrogen efficiently . however, only limited genomic or transcriptomic data of o. longistaminata are currently available.


RESULTS
in this study we present the first comprehensive characterization of the o. longistaminata root transcriptome using  <dig> pyrosequencing. one sequencing run using a normalized cdna library from o. longistaminata roots adapted to low n conditions generated  <dig>  reads, which assembled into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. by similarity search against protein databases, putative functions were assigned to over  <dig>  uni-ests. comparison with ests derived from cultivated rice collections revealed expressed genes across different plant species, however  <dig> % of the o. longistaminata ests had not been detected as expressed in o. sativa. additionally,  <dig> % had no significant similarity to known sequences. rt-pcr and southern blot analyses confirmed the expression of selected novel transcripts in o. longistaminata.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that one run using a genome sequencer flx from  <dig> life science/roche generates sufficient genomic information for adequate de novo assembly of a large number of transcripts in a wild rice species, o. longistaminata. the generated sequence data are publicly available and will facilitate gene discovery in o. longistaminata and rice functional genomic studies. the large number of abundant of novel ests suggests different metabolic activity in o. longistaminata roots in comparison to o. sativa roots.
