BACKGROUND
caseous lymphadenitis  is a disease of small ruminants caused by corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. the pathogenesis of cla is a slow process, and produces a chronic rather than an acute disease state. acute phase proteins  such as haptoglobin  serum amyloid a  and α <dig> acid glycoprotein  are produced by the liver and released into the circulation in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines. the concentration of hp in serum increases in experimental cla but it is not known if saa and agp respond in parallel or have differing response profiles.


RESULTS
the concentration in serum of hp, saa and agp in  <dig> sheep challenged with  <dig> ×  <dig> cells of c. pseudotuberculosis showed significant increases  compared to  <dig> unchallenged control sheep. by day  <dig> post infection.  the hp and saa concentrations reached mean  values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/l respectively. thereafter, their concentrations fell with no significant difference to those of the control sheep by day  <dig> p.i.. in contrast, the serum agp concentration in infected sheep continued to rise to a peak of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l on day  <dig> p.i., after which a slow decline occurred, although the mean concentration remained significantly higher  than the control group up to  <dig> days p.i.. specific igg to phospholidase d of c. pseudotuberculosis became detectable at  <dig> days p.i. and continued to rise throughout the experiment.


CONCLUSIONS
the serum concentrations of hp, saa and agp were raised in sheep in an experimental model of cla. an extended response was found for agp which occurred at a point when the infection was likely to have been transforming from an acute to a chronic phase. the results suggest that agp could have a role as a marker for chronic conditions in sheep.
