BACKGROUND
recognition of pathogenic microorganisms triggers in plants comprehensive transcriptional reprogramming. in order to identify transcriptome-level control elements required for plant immune responses we are examining several sets of genes found by microarray experiments to be co-activated in arabidopsis thaliana  seedlings infected with the oomycete hyaloperonospora parasitica. promoter motifs conserved in clusters of co-expressed genes may be involved in mediating coordinated gene activity patterns. although numerous studies identified such conserved promoter motifs in co-expressed gene sets, reports confirming their function as regulatory elements are rare.


RESULTS
forca is a hexameric promoter motif that is conserved in clusters of arabidopsis genes co-expressed in response to fungal or oomycete pathogens as well as defined light treatments. forca is generally more frequently present in arabidopsis promoter regions than statistically expected. it constitutively interacts in a dna-sequence specific manner with nuclear arabidopsis proteins. these interactions are suppressed by defense-related stimuli and enhanced by prolonged exposure to constant light. furthermore forca mediates constitutive reporter gene expression in transiently transformed nicotiana benthamiana leaves as well as in stably transformed arabidopsis plants. its responsiveness to defense-stimuli is modulated by the duration of light exposure. in plants grown under normal light conditions or constant darkness defense-related stimuli result in suppression of forca-mediated reporter gene expression, while in plants grown under constant light exposure, defense-induction results in enhanced forca-mediated expression. in addition, we found plants subjected to constant light exposure to exhibit reduced susceptibility to virulent h. parasitica.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that forca is a regulatory cis-element that is present in a wide variety of arabidopsis promoters. it integrates light- and defense-related signals and participates in adjusting the transcriptome to changes in environmental conditions.
