BACKGROUND
clear examples of ecological speciation exist, often involving divergence in trophic morphology. however, substantial variation also exists in how far the ecological speciation process proceeds, potentially linked to the number of ecological axes, traits, or genes subject to divergent selection. in addition, recent studies highlight how differentiation might occur between the sexes, rather than between populations. we examine variation in trophic morphology in two host-plant ecotypes of walking-stick insects , known to have diverged in morphological traits related to crypsis and predator avoidance, and to have reached an intermediate point in the ecological speciation process. here we test how host plant use, sex, and rearing environment affect variation in trophic morphology in this species using traditional multivariate, novel kernel density based and bayesian morphometric analyses.


RESULTS
contrary to expectations, we find limited host-associated divergence in mandible shape. instead, the main predictor of shape variation is sex, with secondary roles of population of origin and rearing environment.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that trophic morphology does not strongly contribute to host-adapted ecotype divergence in t. cristinae and that traits can respond to complex selection regimes by diverging along different intraspecific lines, thereby impeding progress toward speciation.
