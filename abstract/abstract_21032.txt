BACKGROUND
actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, a gram-negative bacterium, is the causative agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, a highly contagious and often fatal disease. because current vaccines confer limited protection against a. pleuropneumoniae infection, the development of more effective vaccines is urgently required. the identification of immunogenic and protective antigens, such as an outer-membrane lipoprotein, will advance this purpose.


RESULTS
sixty putative lipoproteins were predicted from the genomic sequence of a. pleuropneumoniae using multiple algorithms. here, we focused on the characteristics of the putative lipoprotein lip <dig> from a. pleuropneumoniae strain slw <dig> . lip <dig> shares sequence similarity with many bacterial lipoproteins, and the structural prediction of lip <dig> suggests that it is similar to a. pleuropneumoniae tbpb. the n-terminus of lip <dig> contains an interesting tandemly repeated sequence, qqpk. real-time rt–pcr indicated that the expression of lip <dig> was significantly upregulated at 42 °c, at 16 °c, and under anaerobic conditions. recombinant lip <dig>  produced in escherichia coli bl <dig> was specifically recognized by porcine convalescent serum directed against a. pleuropneumoniae. lip <dig> was confirmed to localize at the bacterial outer membrane, and its expression was significantly stimulated when a. pleuropneumoniae was cultured under various stress conditions. lip <dig> also protected 75 % of mice from fatal virulent a. pleuropneumoniae infection.


CONCLUSIONS
the immunogenic outer-membrane protein lip <dig> is stress responsive, protects mice against infection, and might be a virulence determinant. further investigation of lip <dig> should expedite vaccine development and provide insight into the pathogenesis of a. pleuropneumoniae.
