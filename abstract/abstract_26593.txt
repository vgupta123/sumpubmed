BACKGROUND
the ap2/erf transcription factor, one of the largest gene families in plants, plays a crucial role in the regulation of growth and development, metabolism, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. castor bean  is one of most important non-edible oilseed crops and its seed oil is broadly used for industrial applications. the available genome provides a great chance to identify and characterize the global information on ap2/erf transcription factors in castor bean, which might provide insights in understanding the molecular basis of the ap2/erf family in castor bean.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> ap2/erf transcription factors were identified based on the genome in castor bean. according to the number of the ap2/erf domain, the conserved amino acid residues within ap2/erf domain, the conserved motifs and gene organization in structure, and phylogenetical analysis, the identified  <dig> ap2/erf transcription factors were characterized. global expression profiles among different tissues using high-throughput sequencing of digital gene expression profiles  displayed diverse expression patterns that may provide basic information in understanding the function of the ap2/erf gene family in castor bean.


CONCLUSIONS
the current study is the first report on identification and characterization of the ap2/erf transcription factors based on the genome of castor bean in the family euphobiaceae. results obtained from this study provide valuable information in understanding the molecular basis of the ap2/erf family in castor bean.
