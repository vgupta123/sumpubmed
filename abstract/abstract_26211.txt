BACKGROUND
copy number variation , a complex genomic rearrangement, has been extensively studied in humans and other organisms. in plants, cnvs of several genes were found to be responsible for various important traits; however, the cause and consequence of cnvs remains largely unknown. recently released next-generation sequencing  data provide an opportunity for a genome-wide study of cnvs in rice.


RESULTS
here, by an ngs-based approach, we generated a cnv map comprising  <dig>  deletions compared to the reference genome ‘nipponbare’. using oryza glaberrima as the outgroup, 80 % of the cnv events turned out to be insertions in nipponbare. there were  <dig>  annotated genes affected by these cnv events. we experimentally validated  <dig> functional cnv genes including osmads <dig>  bph <dig>  osdcl2b and osmads <dig>  implying that cnvs might have contributed to phenotypic variations in rice. most cnv genes were found to be located in non-co-linear positions by comparison to o. glaberrima. one of the origins of these non-co-linear genes was genomic duplications caused by transposon activity or double-strand break repair. comprehensive analysis of mutation mechanisms suggested an abundance of cnvs formed by non-homologous end-joining and mobile element insertion.


CONCLUSIONS
this study showed the impact and origin of copy number variations in rice on a genomic scale.
