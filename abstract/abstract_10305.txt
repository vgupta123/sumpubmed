BACKGROUND
vaccination generating a robust memory population of cd8+ t cells may provide protection against cancer. however, immune therapies for cancer are influenced by the local tumour immune microenvironment. an infiltrate of t cells into tumours of people with colorectal cancer has proven to be a significant indicator of good prognosis.

methods
we used an intracaecal mouse model of cancer to determine whether a protective immune response against a mucosal gut tumour could be generated using a systemic intervention. we investigated the generation of murine memory cd8+ t cells using a sustained antigen release vaccine vehicle  containing the model antigen ovalbumin, chitosan gel alone  or conventional dendritic cell vaccination  using the same protein antigen.


RESULTS
following vaccination with gel + ova, cd8+ t cell memory populations specific for ovalbumin protein were detected. only vaccination with gel + ova gave decreased tumour burden compared to unvaccinated or dc + ova-vaccinated mice in the intracaecal cancer challenge model.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that subcutaneous vaccination with gel + ova generates a population of functional cd8+ memory t cells in lymphoid tissue able to protect against intracaecal tumour challenge. vaccination with chitosan gel may be valuable in anti-cancer treatment at both peripheral and mucosal sites.
