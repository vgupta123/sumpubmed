BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is the major cause of hospital-acquired and community-acquired pneumonia. host defense to s.aureus infection is largely mediated by the innate immune system. γδ t cells play an important role in innate immunity to many infectious diseases. however, less is known about the role of these cells during s.aureus-induced pneumonia. in this study, we examined the response and the role of γδ t cells to pulmonary s.aureus infection.


RESULTS
mice infected with s. aureus intranasally showed rapid γδ t cells accumulation in the lung. deficiency of γδ t cells led to attenuated bacterial clearance and less tissue damage in lung compared with wt mice. moreover, tcr-δ−/− mice exhibited impaired neutrophil recruitment and reduced cytokine production at the site of infection. the γδ t cells in response to pulmonary s. aureus infection mainly secreted il- <dig> and γδ t cells deficiency reduced il- <dig> production, which might regulate the production of neutrophil-inducing cytokine/chemokine in the s. aureus-infected lungs.


CONCLUSIONS
accumulation of γδ t cells in the lungs to s. aureus infection is beneficial for bacteria clearance and also contributes to the tissue damage. these cells were the primary source of il- <dig>  which might influence the recruitment of neutrophils at the early stage of infection.
