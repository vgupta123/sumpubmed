BACKGROUND
the combined use of restriction enzymes with pcr has revolutionized molecular cloning, but is inherently restricted by the content of the manipulated dna sequences. uracil-excision based cloning is ligase and sequence independent and allows seamless fusion of multiple dna sequences in simple one-tube reactions, with higher accuracy than overlapping pcr.


RESULTS
here, the addition of a highly efficient dna polymerase and a low-background-, large-insertion- compatible site-directed mutagenesis protocol is described, largely expanding the versatility of uracil-excision dna engineering.


CONCLUSIONS
the different uracil-excision based molecular tools that have been developed in an open-source fashion, constitute a comprehensive, yet simple and inexpensive toolkit for any need in molecular cloning.
