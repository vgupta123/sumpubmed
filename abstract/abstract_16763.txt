BACKGROUND
mesenchymal stromal/stem cells , isolated under the criteria established by the isct, still have a poorly characterized phenotype that is difficult to distinguish from similar cell populations. although the field of transcriptomics and functional genomics has quickly grown in the last decade, a deep comparative analysis of human mscs expression profiles in a meaningful cellular context has not been yet performed. there is also a need to find a well-defined mscs gene-signature because many recent biomedical studies show that key cellular interaction processes  are dependent on the mesenchymal stem cells within the stromal niche.


RESULTS
in this work we define a core mesenchymal lineage signature of  <dig> genes based on a deep comparative analysis of multiple transcriptomic expression data series that comprise:  mscs of different tissue origins;  mscs in different states of commitment;  other related non-mesenchymal human cell types. the work integrates several public datasets, as well as de-novo produced microarray and rna-seq datasets. the results present tissue-specific signatures for adipose tissue, chorionic placenta, and bone marrow mscs, as well as for dermal fibroblasts; providing a better definition of the relationship between fibroblasts and mscs. finally, novel cd marker patterns and cytokine-receptor profiles are unravelled, especially for bm-mscs; with mcam  revealed as a prevalent marker in this subtype of mscs.


CONCLUSIONS
the improved biomolecular characterization and the released genome-wide expression signatures of human mscs provide a comprehensive new resource that can drive further functional studies and redesigned cell therapy applications.
