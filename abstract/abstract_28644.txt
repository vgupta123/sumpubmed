BACKGROUND
the spike  protein is a major structural glycoprotein of coronavirus , the causal agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome . the s protein is a potent target for sars-specific cell-mediated immune responses. however, the mechanism cov pathogenesis in sars and the role of special ctls in virus clearance are still largely uncharacterized. here, we describe a study that leads to the identification of a novel hla-a*0201-restricted epitope from conserved regions of s protein.


RESULTS
first, different sars-cov sequences were analyzed to predict eight candidate peptides from conserved regions of the s protein based upon hla-a* <dig> binding and proteosomal cleavage. four of eight candidate peptides were tested by hla-a* <dig> binding assays. among the four candidate peptides, sp <dig>  induced specific ctls both ex vivo in pbls of healthy hla-a2+ donors and in hla-a <dig> /kb transgenic mice immunized with a plasmid encoding full-length s protein. the immunized mice released ifn-Î³ and lysed target cells upon stimulation with sp <dig> peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells in comparison to other candidates.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that sp <dig> is a naturally processed epitope. we propose that sp <dig> epitope should help in the characterization of mechanisms of virus control and immunopathology in sars-cov infection.
