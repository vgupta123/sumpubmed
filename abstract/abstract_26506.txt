BACKGROUND
identification and characterization of intervening sequences  within 23s rrna genes from campylobacter organisms including atypical campylobacters were carried out using two pcr primer pairs, designed to generate helix  <dig> and  <dig> regions.


RESULTS
only c. sputorum biovar sputorum lmg <dig> and fecalis lmg <dig>  lmg <dig> and lmg <dig> of a total of  <dig> campylobacter isolates  were shown to carry ivss in helix  <dig> region. c. sputorum biovar fecalis lmg <dig> and lmg <dig>  interestingly, carried two different kinds of the 23s rrna genes with and without the ivs, respectively. consequently, in a total of  <dig> isolates of  <dig>  including  <dig> c. lari isolates examined previously, the absence of ivss was identified in the helix  <dig> region. in the helix  <dig> region, all the c. hyointestinalis, c. sputorum and c. concisus isolates were shown not to carry any ivss. however, the  <dig> of  <dig> c. jejuni isolates ,  <dig> of  <dig> c. coli ,  <dig> of  <dig> c. fetus ,  <dig> of  <dig> c. upsaliensis  and  <dig> of  <dig> c. curvus  were shown to carry ivss. in c. jejuni and c. upsaliensis isolates, two different kinds of the 23s rrna genes were also identified to occur with and without ivss in the helix  <dig> region, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
secondary structure models were also constructed with all the ivss identified in the present study. in the purified rna fractions from the isolates which carried the 16s or 23s rrna genes with the ivss, no 16s or 23s rrna was evident, respectively.
