BACKGROUND
saffron  flowers have been used as a spice and medicinal plant ever since the greek-minoan civilization. the edible part – the stigmas – are commonly considered the most expensive spice in the world and are the site of a peculiar secondary metabolism, responsible for the characteristic color and flavor of saffron.


RESULTS
we produced  <dig>  high quality expressed sequence tags  from a saffron stigma cdna library. this collection is accessible and searchable through the saffron genes database http://www.saffrongenes.org. the ests have been grouped into  <dig>  clusters, each corresponding to a different expressed gene, and annotated. the complete set of raw est sequences, as well as of their electopherograms, are maintained in the database, allowing users to investigate sequence qualities and est structural features . the saffron stigma transcriptome contains a series of interesting sequences .


CONCLUSIONS
the saffron genes database represents the first reference collection for the genomics of iridaceae, for the molecular biology of stigma biogenesis, as well as for the metabolic pathways underlying saffron secondary metabolism.
