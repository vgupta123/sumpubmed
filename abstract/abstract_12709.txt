BACKGROUND
phosphate <dig>  gene family members have diverse roles in plant growth and development, and they have been studied in arabidopsis, rice, and physcomitrella. however, it has yet to be described in other plants. therefore, we surveyed the evolutionary patterns of genomes within the plant pho <dig> gene family, focusing on soybean  due to its economic importance.


RESULTS
our data show that pho <dig> genes could be classified into two major groups . class i genes were only present and expanded in dicotyledonous plants and selaginella moellendorffii; class ii genes were found in all land plants. class i sequence losses in other lineages may be attributed to gene loss after duplication events in land plant evolution. introns varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  and ancestral state reconstruction analyses revealed that genes with  <dig> introns were ancestral, thus suggesting that the intron loss was a chief constituent of pho <dig> gene evolution. in the soybean genome, only  <dig> pho1-like genes  were detected at the mrna level. these genes display tissue-specific or tissue-preferential expression patterns during soybean plant and fruit development. class i genes were more broadly expressed than class ii. gmapho <dig> genes had altered expression in response to salt, osmotic, and inorganic phosphate stresses.


CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed that pho <dig> genes originated from a eukaryotic ancestor and that two major classes formed in land plants. class i genes are only present in dicots and lycophytes. gmapho1genes had diverse expression patterns in soybean, indicating their dramatic functional diversification.
