BACKGROUND
the open reading frames of subab genes and their flanking regions of  <dig> food-borne shiga toxin-producing e. coli  strains were analyzed.


RESULTS
all but one subab open reading frames  were complete in all stec strains. the subab <dig> genes of nine stec strains were located on large plasmids. the subab <dig> allele , which was recently described by others to be present in the subtilase-encoding pai  was found in  <dig> stec strains. a new chromosomal subab <dig> variant, designated subab2- <dig> was detected in  <dig> strains and was linked to a chromosomal gene hypothetically encoding an outer membrane efflux protein . three stec strains contained both subab <dig> variants. dna analysis indicated sequence conservation in the plasmid-located alleles and sequence heterogeneity among the chromosomal subab <dig> genes.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study have shown that  <dig> subab-pcr positive stec strains contain complete subab open reading frames. furthermore, the new allelic variant subab2- <dig> was described, which can occur in addition to subab2- <dig> on a new chromosomal locus.
