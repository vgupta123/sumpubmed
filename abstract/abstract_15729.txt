BACKGROUND
the basal forebrain  regulates cortical activity by the action of cholinergic projections to the cortex. at the same time, it also sends substantial gabaergic projections to both cortex and thalamus, whose functional role has received far less attention. we used deep brain stimulation  in the bf, which is thought to activate both types of projections, to investigate the impact of bf activation on v <dig> neural activity.


RESULTS
bf stimulation robustly increased v <dig> single and multi-unit activity, led to moderate decreases in orientation selectivity and a remarkable increase in contrast sensitivity as demonstrated by a reduced semi-saturation contrast. the spontaneous v <dig> local field potential often exhibited spectral peaks centered at  <dig> and  <dig> hz as well as reliably showed a broad γ-band  increase following bf stimulation, whereas effects in a low frequency band  were less consistent. the broad γ-band, rather than low frequency activity or spectral peaks was the best predictor of both the firing rate increase and contrast sensitivity increase of v <dig> unit activity.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that bf activation has a strong influence on contrast sensitivity in v <dig>  we suggest that, in addition to cholinergic modulation, the bf gabaergic projections play a crucial role in the impact of bf dbs on cortical activity.
