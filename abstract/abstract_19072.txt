BACKGROUND
many biological processes involve the physical interaction between protein domains. understanding these functional associations requires knowledge of the molecular structure. experimental investigations though present considerable difficulties and there is therefore a need for accurate and reliable computational methods. in this paper we present a novel method that seeks to dock protein domains using a contact map representation. rather than providing a full three dimensional model of the complex, the method predicts contacting residues across the interface. we use a scoring function that combines structural, physicochemical and evolutionary information, where each potential residue contact is assigned a value according to the scoring function and the hypothesis is that the real configuration of contacts is the one that maximizes the score. the search is performed with a simulated annealing algorithm directly in contact space.


RESULTS
we have tested the method on interacting domain pairs that are part of the same protein . we show that it correctly predicts some contacts and that predicted residues tend to be significantly closer to each other than other pairs of residues in the same domains. moreover we find that predicted contacts can often discriminate the best model  among a set of optimal solutions generated by a standard docking procedure.


CONCLUSIONS
contact docking appears feasible and able to complement other computational methods for the prediction of protein-protein interactions. with respect to more standard docking algorithms it might be more suitable to handle protein conformational changes and to predict complexes starting from protein models.
