BACKGROUND
dna transposons have emerged as indispensible tools for manipulating vertebrate genomes with applications ranging from insertional mutagenesis and transgenesis to gene therapy. to fully explore the potential of two highly active dna transposons, piggybac and tol <dig>  as mammalian genetic tools, we have conducted a side-by-side comparison of the two transposon systems in the same setting to evaluate their advantages and disadvantages for use in gene therapy and gene discovery.


RESULTS
we have observed that  the tol <dig> transposase  is highly sensitive to molecular engineering;  the piggybac donor with only the  <dig> bp 3'-and  <dig> bp 5'-terminal repeat domain is sufficient for effective transposition; and  a small amount of piggybac transposases results in robust transposition suggesting the piggybac transpospase is highly active. performing genome-wide target profiling on data sets obtained by retrieving chromosomal targeting sequences from individual clones, we have identified several piggybac and tol <dig> hotspots and observed that  piggybac and tol <dig> display a clear difference in targeting preferences in the human genome. finally, we have observed that  only sites with a particular sequence context can be targeted by either piggybac or tol <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the non-overlapping targeting preference of piggybac and tol <dig> makes them complementary research tools for manipulating mammalian genomes. piggybac is the most promising transposon-based vector system for achieving site-specific targeting of therapeutic genes due to the flexibility of its transposase for being molecularly engineered. insights from this study will provide a basis for engineering piggybac transposases to achieve site-specific therapeutic gene targeting.
