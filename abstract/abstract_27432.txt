BACKGROUND
clinical isolates of the gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori display a high level of genetic macro- and microheterogeneity, featuring a panmictic, rather than clonal structure. the ability of h. pylori to survive the stomach acid is due, in part, to the arginase-urease enzyme system. arginase  hydrolyzes l-arginine to l-ornithine and urea, and urease hydrolyzes urea to carbon dioxide and ammonium, which can neutralize acid.


RESULTS
the degree of variation in arginase was explored at the dna sequence, enzyme activity and protein expression levels. to this end, arginase activity was measured from  <dig> minimally-passaged clinical isolates and six laboratory-adapted strains of h. pylori. the rocf gene from  <dig> of the strains was cloned into genetically stable e. coli and the enzyme activities measured. arginase activity was found to substantially vary  in both different h. pylori strains and in the e. coli model. western blot analysis revealed a positive correlation between activity and amount of protein expressed in most h. pylori strains. several h. pylori strains featured altered arginase activity upon in vitro passage. pairwise alignments of the  <dig> rocf genes plus strain j <dig> revealed extensive microheterogeneity in the promoter region and 3' end of the rocf coding region. amino acid s <dig>  which was i <dig> in the arginase-negative clinical strain a <dig>  was critical for arginase activity.


CONCLUSIONS
these studies demonstrated that h. pylori arginase exhibits extensive genotypic and phenotypic variation which may be used to understand mechanisms of microheterogeneity in h. pylori.
