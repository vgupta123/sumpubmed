BACKGROUND
identifying protein-protein interactions  from literature is an important step in mining the function of individual proteins as well as their biological network. since it is known that ppis have distinctive patterns in text, machine learning approaches have been successfully applied to mine these patterns. however, the complex nature of ppi description makes the extraction process difficult.


RESULTS
our approach utilizes both word and syntactic features to effectively capture ppi patterns from biomedical literature. the proposed method automatically identifies gene names by a priority model, then extracts grammar relations using a dependency parser. a large margin classifier with huber loss function learns from the extracted features, and unknown articles are predicted using this data-driven model. for the biocreative iii act evaluation, our official runs were ranked in top positions by obtaining maximum  <dig> % accuracy,  <dig> % f <dig> score,  <dig>  mcc score, and  <dig> % auc ip/r score.


CONCLUSIONS
even though problems still remain, utilizing syntactic information for article-level filtering helps improve ppi ranking performance. the proposed system is a revision of previously developed algorithms in our group for the act evaluation. our approach is valuable in showing how to use grammatical relations for ppi article filtering, in particular, with a limited training corpus. while current performance is far from satisfactory as an annotation tool, it is already useful for a ppi article search engine since users are mainly focused on highly-ranked results.
