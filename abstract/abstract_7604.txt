BACKGROUND
rex1/zfp <dig> has been extensively used as a marker for the undifferentiated state of pluripotent stem cells. however, its function in pluripotent stem cells including embryonic stem  cells remained unclear although its involvement in visceral endoderm differentiation in f <dig> embryonal carcinoma  cells was reported.


RESULTS
we showed the function of rex <dig> in mouse es cells as well as in embryos using the conventional gene targeting strategy. our results clearly indicated that rex <dig> function is dispensable for both the maintenance of pluripotency in es cells and the development of embryos. however, rex1-/- es cells showed the defect to induce a subset of the marker genes of visceral endoderm, when differentiated as embryoid body, as found in ec cells.


CONCLUSIONS
rex <dig> should be regarded just as a marker of pluripotency without functional significance like the activity of alkaline phosphatase.
