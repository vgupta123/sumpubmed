BACKGROUND
the outer membrane protein m <dig> is a conserved porin of type  <dig> strains of the respiratory pathogen moraxella catarrhalis. it was previously shown that m <dig> is involved in the uptake of essential nutrients required for bacterial growth and for nasal colonization in mice. the aim of this study was  to characterize the potential roles of m <dig> in the host-pathogen interactions considering the known multifunctionality of porins and  to characterize the degree of conservation in the phylogenetic older subpopulation  of m. catarrhalis.


RESULTS
isogenic m <dig> mutants of the type  <dig> strains o35e,  <dig> and  <dig> were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibility against  <dig> different agents. differences in the mic  between wild-type and mutant strains were found for eight antibiotics. for ampicillin and amoxicillin, we observed a statistically significant  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold mic increase  in the m <dig> mutants. immunoblot analysis demonstrated that human saliva contains anti-m <dig> iga. wild-type strains and their respective m <dig> mutants were indistinguishable with respect to the phenotypes of autoagglutination, serum resistance, iron acquisition from human lactoferrin, adherence to and invasion of respiratory tract epithelial cells, and proinflammatory stimulation of human monocytes. dna sequencing of m <dig> from the phylogenetic subpopulation type  <dig> strain  <dig> revealed  <dig> % and  <dig> % identity on the dna and amino acid levels, respectively, in comparison with type  <dig> strains.


CONCLUSIONS
the increase in mic for ampicillin and amoxicillin, respectively, in the m35-deficient mutants indicates that this porin affects the outer membrane permeability for aminopenicillins in a clinically relevant manner. the presence of iga antibodies in healthy human donors indicates that m <dig> is expressed in vivo and recognized as a mucosal antigen by the human host. however, immunoblot analysis of human saliva suggests the possibility of antigenic variation of immunoreactive epitopes, which warrants further analysis before m <dig> can be considered a potential vaccine candidate.
