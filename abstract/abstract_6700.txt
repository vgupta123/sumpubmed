BACKGROUND
genetic populations provide the basis for a wide range of genetic and genomic studies and have been widely used in genetic mapping, gene discovery and genomics-assisted breeding. chromosome segment substitution lines  are the most powerful tools for the detection and precise mapping of quantitative trait loci , for the analysis of complex traits in plant molecular genetics.


RESULTS
in this study, a wide population consisting of  <dig> cssls was developed, derived from the crossing and back-crossing of two sequenced rice cultivars:  <dig>  an elite indica cultivar as the recipient and nipponbare, a japonica cultivar as the donor. first, a physical map of the  <dig> cssls was constructed on the basis of estimates of the lengths and locations of the substituted chromosome segments using  <dig> pcr-based molecular markers. from this map, the total size of the  <dig> substituted segments in the population was  <dig>  mb, was  <dig>  times that of the rice genome. second, every cssl underwent high-throughput genotyping by whole-genome re-sequencing with a  <dig> Ã— genome sequence, and an ultrahigh-quality physical map was constructed. this sequencing-based physical map indicated that  <dig> new segments were detected; almost all were shorter than  <dig> mb and were not apparent in the molecular marker map. furthermore, relative to the molecular marker-based map, the sequencing-based map yielded more precise recombination breakpoint determination and greater accuracy of the lengths of the substituted segments, and provided more accurate background information. third, using the  <dig> cssls combined with the bin-map converted from the sequencing-based physical map, a multiple linear regression qtl analysis mapped nine qtls, which explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance for culm length. a large-effect qtl was located in a  <dig>  bp region that contained the rice 'green revolution' gene.


CONCLUSIONS
the present results demonstrated that high throughput genotyped cssls combine the advantages of an ultrahigh-quality physical map with high mapping accuracy, thus being of great potential value for gene discovery and genetic mapping. these cssls may provide powerful tools for future whole genome large-scale gene discovery in rice and offer foundations enabling the development of superior rice varieties.
