BACKGROUND
diacylglycerol kinase  is a key enzyme that regulates diacylglycerol  turnover and is involved in a variety of physiological functions. the isoform dgkθ has a unique domain structure and is the sole member of type v dgk. to reveal the spatial and temporal expression of dgkθ we performed immunohistochemical staining on paraffin sections of mouse embryos.


RESULTS
at an early stage of development , the expression of dgkθ was prominently detected in the brain, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglion, and limb bud, and was also moderately detected in the bulbus cordis and the primordium of the liver and gut. at later stages , dgkθ expression persisted or increased in the neocortex, epithalamus, hypothalamus, medulla oblongata, and pons. dgkθ was also evident in the epidermis, and nearly all epithelia of the oropharyngeal membrane, digestive tract, and bronchea. at prenatal developmental stages , the expression pattern of dgkθ was maintained in the central nervous system, intestine, and kidney, but was attenuated in the differentiated epidermis.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that dgkθ may play important physiological roles not only in the brain, but also in diverse organs and tissues during the embryonic stages.
