BACKGROUND
aggregation of the amyloid peptides, aβ <dig> and aβ <dig>  is known to be involved in the pathology of alzheimer's disease . here we investigate the relationship between peptide aggregation and cell surface binding of three forms of aβ .


RESULTS
using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry with fluorescently labelled aβ, we demonstrate a correlation between the aggregation propensity of the alzheimer amyloid peptides and their neuronal cell surface association. we find that the highly aggregation prone aβ <dig> associates with the surface of neuronal cells within one hour, while the less aggregation prone aβ <dig> associates over  <dig> hours. we show that a double mutation in aβ <dig> that reduces its aggregation propensity also reduces its association with the cell surface. furthermore, we find that a cell line that is resistant to aβ cytotoxicity, the non-neuronal human lymphoma cell line u <dig>  does not bind either aβ <dig> or aβ <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our findings reveal that amyloid peptide aggregation propensity is an essential determinant of neuronal cell surface association. we anticipate that our approach, involving aβ imaging in live cells, will be highly useful for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic drugs that prevent toxic aβ association with neuronal cells.
