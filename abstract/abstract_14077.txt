BACKGROUND
the mammalian inner ear contains the organ of corti which is responsible for the conversion of sound into neuronal signals. this specialised epithelial tissue is the product of a complex developmental process where a common precursor cell type differentiates into the sound transducing hair cells and the non-innervated supporting cells. we hypothesised that integrin proteins, which are involved in cell attachment to extracellular matrix proteins and cellular signalling, play a role in the differentiation process of the precursor inner ear epithelial cells. to test our hypothesis we have utilised a cell line  derived from e <dig> embryonic immortomouse inner ears. in vitro, by switching the incubation temperature from 33°c to 39°c, the oc- <dig> cells can be induced to differentiate and express hair cells markers, such as myosin viia. the oc- <dig> cells are thus a useful model system for testing mechanism of hair cells differentiation.


RESULTS
we have identified  <dig> integrin subunits which are expressed in oc- <dig> cells: α <dig>  αv, β <dig> and β <dig>  among these, the relative level of expression of the αv, β <dig> and β <dig> subunits increased in a time dependent manner when the cells were exposed to the differentiating temperature of 39°c, most notably so for β <dig> which was not detectable at 33°c. treatment of fully differentiated oc- <dig> cells with sirna against the four integrin subunits reduced the expression of not only the respective integrin proteins but also of the hair cell marker myosin viia. conversely over-expression of β <dig> was sufficient to induce the expression of myosin viia at 33°c.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate that modulation of integrin expression is associated with the differentiation process of the oc- <dig> cells. this suggests that the maturation of the organ of corti, from where oc- <dig> cells are derived, may also depend on changes of gene expression associated with integrin expression.
