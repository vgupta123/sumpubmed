BACKGROUND
within-generational plasticity  and transgenerational plasticity  are mechanisms allowing rapid adaptive responses to fluctuating environments without genetic change. these forms of plasticity have often been viewed as independent processes. recent evidence suggests that wgp is altered by the environmental conditions experienced by previous generations . in the context of inducible defenses, one of the most studied cases of plasticity, the wgp x tgp interaction has been poorly investigated.


RESULTS
we provide evidence that tgp can alter the reaction norms of inducible defenses in a freshwater snail. the wgp x tgp interaction patterns are trait-specific and lead to decreased slope of reaction norms . offspring from induced parents showed a higher predator avoidance behaviour and a thicker shell than snails from non-induced parents in no predator-cue environment while they reached similar defenses in predator-cue environment. the wgp x tgp interaction further lead to a switch from a plastic towards a constitutive expression of defenses for shell dimensions .


CONCLUSIONS
wgp-alteration by tgp may shape the adaptive responses to environmental change and then has a substantial importance to understand the evolution of plasticity.
