BACKGROUND
the prevalence of type  <dig> diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate. various complications are associated with type  <dig> diabetes, with diabetic nephropathy being the leading cause of renal failure among diabetics. often, when patients are diagnosed with diabetic nephropathy, their renal functions have already been significantly damaged. therefore, a risk prediction tool may be beneficial for the implementation of early treatment and prevention.


RESULTS
in the present study, we developed a decision tree-based model integrating genetic and clinical features in a gender-specific classification for the identification of diabetic nephropathy among type  <dig> diabetic patients. clinical and genotyping data were obtained from a previous genetic association study involving  <dig> type  <dig> diabetic patients . using a five-fold cross-validation approach, the performance of using clinical or genetic features alone in various classifiers  was compared with that of utilizing a combination of attributes. the inclusion of genetic features and the implementation of an additional gender-based rule yielded better classification results.


CONCLUSIONS
the current model supports the notion that genes and gender are contributing factors of diabetic nephropathy. further refinement of the proposed approach has the potential to facilitate the early identification of diabetic nephropathy and the development of more efficient treatment in a clinical setting.
