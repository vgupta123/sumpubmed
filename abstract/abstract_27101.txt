BACKGROUND
examination of complex biological systems has long been achieved through methodical investigation of the system’s individual components. while informative, this strategy often leads to inappropriate conclusions about the system as a whole. with the advent of high-throughput “omic” technologies, however, researchers can now simultaneously analyze an entire system at the level of molecule  and process . this strategy reduces the likelihood of improper conclusions, provides a framework for elucidation of genotype-phenotype relationships, and brings finer resolution to comparative genomic experiments. here, we apply a multi-omic approach to analyze the gene expression profiles of two closely related pseudomonas aeruginosa strains grown in n-alkanes or glycerol.


RESULTS
the environmental p. aeruginosa isolate atcc  <dig> consumed medium-length  n-alkanes more rapidly than the laboratory strain pao <dig>  despite high genome sequence identity . our data shows that atcc  <dig> induces a characteristic set of genes at the transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels during growth on alkanes, many of which differ from those expressed by pao <dig>  of particular interest was the lack of expression from the rhl operon of the quorum sensing  system, resulting in no measurable rhamnolipid production by atcc  <dig>  further examination showed that atcc  <dig> lacked the entire lasi/lasr arm of the qs response. instead of promoting expression of qs genes, atcc  <dig> up-regulates a small subset of its genome, including operons responsible for specific alkaline proteases and sphingosine metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
this work represents the first time results from rna-seq, microarray, ribosome footprinting, proteomics, and small molecule lc-ms experiments have been integrated to compare gene expression in bacteria. together, these data provide insights as to why strain atcc  <dig> is better adapted for growth and survival on n-alkanes.
