BACKGROUND
plasmalemmal vesicle associated protein- <dig>  is selectively expressed in human brain microvascular endothelial cells derived from clinical specimens of primary and secondary malignant brain tumors, cerebral ischemia, and other central nervous system  diseases associated with blood-brain barrier breakdown. in this study, we characterize the murine cns expression pattern of pv- <dig> to determine whether localized pv- <dig> induction is conserved across species and disease state.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that pv- <dig> is selectively upregulated in mouse blood vessels recruited by brain tumor xenografts at the rna and protein levels, but is not detected in non-neoplastic brain. additionally, pv- <dig> is induced in a mouse model of acute ischemia. expression is confined to the cerebovasculature within the region of infarct and is temporally regulated.


CONCLUSIONS
our results confirm that pv- <dig> is preferentially induced in the endothelium of mouse brain tumors and acute ischemic brain tissue and corresponds to blood-brain barrier disruption in a fashion analogous to human patients. characterization of pv- <dig> expression in mouse brain is the first step towards development of rodent models for testing anti-edema and anti-angiogenesis therapeutic strategies based on this molecule.
