BACKGROUND
axons from the visceral motor neurons  project from nuclei in the hindbrain to innervate autonomic ganglia and branchial arch-derived muscles. although much is known about the events that govern specification of somatic motor neurons, the genetic pathways responsible for the development of vmns are less well characterized. we know that vmns, like all motor neurons, depend on sonic hedgehog signaling for their generation. similarly, the paired-like homeobox 2b  gene, which is expressed in both proliferating progenitors and post-mitotic motor neurons, is essential for the development of vmns. given that our previous study identified a novel role for the short stature homeobox  <dig>  gene in the hindbrain, and since shox <dig> has been shown to regulate transcription of islet  <dig> , an important regulator of vmn development, we sought to determine whether shox <dig> is required for the proper development of the facial motor nucleus.


RESULTS
using a nestin-cre driver, we show that elimination of shox <dig> throughout the brain results in elevated cell death in the facial motor nucleus at embryonic day  <dig>   and e <dig> , which correlates with impaired axonal projection properties of vmns. we also observed changes in the spatial expression of the vmn cell fate factors isl <dig> and phox2b, and concomitant defects in shh and ptch <dig> expression in shox <dig> mutants. furthermore, we demonstrate that elimination of shox <dig> results in the loss of dorsomedial and ventromedial subnuclei by postnatal day  <dig> , which may explain the changes in physical activity and impaired feeding/nursing behavior in shox <dig> mutants.


CONCLUSIONS
combined, our data show that shox <dig> is required for development of the facial motor nucleus and its associated facial  nerves, and serves as a new molecular tool to probe the genetic programs of this understudied hindbrain region.
