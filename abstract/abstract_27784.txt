BACKGROUND
the serine protease thrombin catalyzes fibrin clot formation by converting fibrinogen into fibrin. additionally, thrombin stimulation leads to an activation of stimulus-responsive transcription factors in different cell types, indicating that the gene expression pattern is changed in thrombin-stimulated cells. the objective of this study was to analyze the signaling cascade leading to the expression of the zinc finger transcription factor egr- <dig> in thrombin-stimulated lung fibroblasts.


RESULTS
stimulation of 39m1- <dig> fibroblasts with thrombin induced a robust and transient biosynthesis of egr- <dig>  reporter gene analysis revealed that the newly synthesized egr- <dig> was biologically active. the signaling cascade connecting thrombin stimulation with egr- <dig> gene expression required elevated levels of cytosolic ca2+, the activation of diacylgycerol-dependent protein kinase c isoenzymes, and the activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase . stimulation of the cells with thrombin triggered the phosphorylation of the transcription factor elk- <dig>  expression of a dominant-negative mutant of elk- <dig> completely prevented egr- <dig> expression in stimulated 39m1- <dig> cells, indicating that elk- <dig> or related ternary complex factors connect the intracellular signaling cascade elicited by activation of protease-activated receptors with transcription of the egr- <dig> gene. lentiviral-mediated expression of map kinase phosphatase- <dig>  a dual-specific phosphatase that dephosphorylates and inactivates erk in the nucleus, prevented elk- <dig> phosphorylation and egr- <dig> biosynthesis in thrombin stimulated 39m1- <dig> cells, confirming the importance of nuclear erk and elk- <dig> for the upregulation of egr- <dig> expression in thrombin-stimulated lung fibroblasts. 39m1- <dig> cells additionally express m <dig> muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. a comparison between the signaling cascades induced by thrombin or carbachol showed no differences, except that signal transduction via m <dig> muscarinic acetylcholine receptors required the transactivation of the egf receptor, while thrombin signaling did not.


CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that stimulus-transcription coupling in thrombin-treated lung fibroblasts relies on the elevation of the intracellular ca2+-concentration and the activation of pkc and erk. in the nucleus, ternary complex factors function as key proteins linking the intracellular signaling cascade with enhanced transcription of the egr- <dig> gene. this study further shows that the dominant-negative elk- <dig> mutant is a valuable tool to study elk-1-mediated gene transcription.
