BACKGROUND
many pathogens secrete toxins that target key host processes resulting in the activation of immune pathways. the secreted pseudomonas aeruginosa toxin exotoxin a  disrupts intestinal protein synthesis, which triggers the induction of a subset of p. aeruginosa-response genes in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans.


RESULTS
we show here that one toxa-induced c. elegans gene, the tribbles pseudokinase ortholog nipi- <dig>  is essential for host survival following exposure to p. aeruginosa or toxa. we find that nipi- <dig> mediates the post-developmental expression of intestinal immune genes and proteins and primarily functions in parallel to known immune pathways, including p <dig> mapk signaling. through mutagenesis screening, we identify mutants of the bzip c/ebp transcription factor cebp- <dig> that suppress the hypersusceptibility defects of nipi- <dig> mutants.


CONCLUSIONS
nipi- <dig> is a negative regulator of cebp- <dig>  which in turn negatively regulates protective immune mechanisms. this pathway represents a previously unknown innate immune signaling pathway in intestinal epithelial cells that is involved in the surveillance of cellular homeostasis. because nipi- <dig> and cebp- <dig> are also essential for c. elegans development, nipi- <dig> is analogous to other key innate immune signaling molecules such as the toll receptors in drosophila that have an independent role during development.
