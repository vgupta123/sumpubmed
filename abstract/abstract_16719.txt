BACKGROUND
the prediction of transcription factor binding sites is difficult for many reasons. thus, filtering methods are needed to enrich for biologically relevant  matches in the large amount of computational predictions that are frequently generated from promoter sequences.


RESULTS
rexspecies  <dig> filters predictions of transcription factor binding sites and generates a set of figures displaying them in evolutionary context. more specifically, it uses position specific scoring matrices to search for motifs that specify transcription factor binding sites. it removes redundant matches and filters the remaining matches by the phylogenetic group that the matrices belong to. it then identifies potential transcriptional modules, and generates figures that highlight such modules, taking evolution into consideration. module formation, scoring by evolutionary criteria and visual clues reduce the amount of predictions to a manageable scale. identification of transcription factor binding sites of particular functional importance is left to expert filtering. rexspecies  <dig> interacts with genome browsers to enable scientists to filter predictions together with other sequence-related data.


CONCLUSIONS
based on rexspecies  <dig>  we derive plausible hypotheses about the regulation of pluripotency. our tool is designed to analyze transcription factor binding site predictions considering their common pattern of occurrence, highlighting their evolutionary history.
