BACKGROUND
characterisation of plastid genome  polymorphisms is commonly used for phylogeographic, population genetic and forensic analyses in plants, but detecting cpdna variation is sometimes challenging, limiting the applications of such an approach. in the present study, we screened cpdna polymorphism in the olive tree  by sequencing the complete plastid genome of trees with a distinct cpdna lineage. our objective was to develop new markers for a rapid genomic profiling  of cpdna haplotypes in the mediterranean olive tree.


RESULTS
eight complete cpdna genomes of olea were sequenced de novo. the nucleotide divergence between olive cpdna lineages was low and not exceeding  <dig> %. based on these sequences, markers were developed for studying two single nucleotide substitutions and length polymorphism of  <dig> regions . they were then used to genotype the cpdna variation in cultivated and wild mediterranean olive trees . forty polymorphic loci were detected on this sample, allowing the distinction of  <dig> haplotypes belonging to the three mediterranean cpdna lineages known as e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig>  the discriminating power of cpdna variation was particularly low for the cultivated olive tree with one predominating haplotype, but more diversity was detected in wild populations.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose a method for a rapid characterisation of the mediterranean olive germplasm. the low variation in the cultivated olive tree indicated that the utility of cpdna variation for forensic analyses is limited to rare haplotypes. in contrast, the high cpdna variation in wild populations demonstrated that our markers may be useful for phylogeographic and populations genetic studies in o. europaea.
