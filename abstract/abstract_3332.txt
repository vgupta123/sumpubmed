BACKGROUND
linezolid is one of the most effective treatments against gram-positive pathogens. however, linezolid-resistant/intermediate strains have recently emerged in worldwide. the purpose of this study was to analyse the prevalence and resistance mechanisms of linezolid-resistant/intermediate staphylococci and enterococci in shanghai, china.


RESULTS
thirty-two linezolid-resistant/intermediate strains, including 14 staphylococcus capitis, three staphylococcus aureus,  <dig> enterococcus faecalis and one enterococcus faecium clinical isolates, were collected in this study which displayed linezolid mics of  <dig> to 512 μg/ml, 8–32 μg/ml, 4–8 μg/ml and 4 μg/ml, respectively. all linezolid-resistant s. capitis isolates had a novel c2131t mutation and a g2603t mutation in the 23s rrna region, and some had a c316t  substitution in protein l <dig> and/or harboured cfr. linezolid-resistant s. aureus isolates carried a c389g  substitution in protein l <dig>  and/or harboured cfr. the cfr gene was flanked by two copies of the is256-like element, with a downstream orf <dig> gene. linezolid-resistant/intermediate enterococci lacked major resistance mechanisms. the semi-quantitative biofilm assay showed that  <dig> linezolid-resistant e. faecalis isolates produced a larger biofilm than linezolid-susceptible e. faecalis strains. transmission electron microscopy showed the cell walls of linezolid-resistant/intermediate strains were thicker than linezolid-susceptible strains.


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicated that major resistance mechanisms, such as mutations in 23s rrna and ribosomal proteins l <dig> and l <dig>  along with cfr acquisition, played an important role in linezolid resistance. secondary resistance mechanisms, such as biofilm formation and cell wall thickness, should also be taken into account.
