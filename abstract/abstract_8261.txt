BACKGROUND
radish  is an economically important root vegetable crop, and the taproot-thickening process is the most critical period for the final productivity and quality formation. micrornas  are a family of non-coding small rnas that play an important regulatory function in plant growth and development. however, the characterization of mirnas and their roles in regulating radish taproot growth and thickening remain largely unexplored. a solexa high-throughput sequencing technology was used to identify key mirnas involved in taproot thickening in radish.


RESULTS
three small rna libraries from ‘nau-yh’ taproot collected at pre-cortex splitting stage, cortex splitting stage and expanding stage were constructed. in all,  <dig> known and  <dig> potential novel mirnas were discovered, from which  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas were found to be significantly differentially expressed during taproot thickening. furthermore, totally  <dig> target genes were identified for the differentially expressed mirnas. these target genes were annotated as transcription factors and other functional proteins, which were involved in various biological functions including plant growth and development, metabolism, cell organization and biogenesis, signal sensing and transduction, and plant defense response. rt-qpcr analysis validated mirna expression patterns for five mirnas and their corresponding target genes.


CONCLUSIONS
the small rna populations of radish taproot at different thickening stages were firstly identified by solexa sequencing. totally  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas identified from three taproot libraries might play important regulatory roles in taproot thickening. their targets encoding transcription factors and other functional proteins including nf-ya <dig>  ilr <dig>  bhlh <dig>  xth <dig>  cel <dig> and expa <dig> were involved in radish taproot thickening. these results could provide new insights into the regulatory roles of mirnas during the taproot thickening and facilitate genetic improvement of taproot in radish.
