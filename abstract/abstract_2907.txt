BACKGROUND
rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen magnaporthe grisea, is a devastating disease causing tremendous yield loss in rice production. the public availability of the complete genome sequence of m. grisea provides ample opportunities to understand the molecular mechanism of its pathogenesis on rice plants at the transcriptome level. to identify all the expressed genes encoded in the fungal genome, we have analyzed the mycelium and appressorium transcriptomes using massively parallel signature sequencing , robust-long serial analysis of gene expression  and oligoarray methods.


RESULTS
the mpss analyses identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  distinct significant tags from mycelia and appressoria, respectively, while the rl-sage analysis identified  <dig>  distinct significant tags from the mycelial library. when matching these  <dig>  mycelial and  <dig>  appressorial significant tags to the annotated cds,  <dig> bp upstream and  <dig> bp downstream of cds,  <dig>  unique genes in mycelia and  <dig>  unique genes in appressoria were identified. a total of  <dig>  mycelium-specific and  <dig>  appressorium-specific significant mpss tags were identified, which correspond to  <dig>  and  <dig>  annotated genes, respectively, when matching to the same set of reference sequences. nearly 85% of the significant mpss tags from mycelia and appressoria and 65% of the significant tags from the rl-sage mycelium library matched to the m. grisea genome. mpss and rl-sage methods supported the expression of more than  <dig>  genes, representing over 80% of the predicted genes in m. grisea. about 40% of the mpss tags and 55% of the rl-sage tags represent novel transcripts since they had no matches in the existing m. grisea est collections. over 19% of the annotated genes were found to produce both sense and antisense tags in the protein-coding region. the oligoarray analysis identified the expression of  <dig>  mycelium-specific and  <dig>  appressorium-specific genes. a total of  <dig>  mycelial genes and  <dig>  appressorial genes were identified by both mpss and oligoarray.


CONCLUSIONS
the comprehensive and deep transcriptome analysis by mpss and rl-sage methods identified many novel sense and antisense transcripts in the m. grisea genome at two important growth stages. the differentially expressed transcripts that were identified, especially those specifically expressed in appressoria, represent a genomic resource useful for gaining a better understanding of the molecular basis of m. grisea pathogenicity. further analysis of the novel antisense transcripts will provide new insights into the regulation and function of these genes in fungal growth, development and pathogenesis in the host plants.
