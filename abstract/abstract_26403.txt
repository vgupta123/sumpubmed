BACKGROUND
ago  protein participates in plant developmental processes and virus defense as a core element of transcriptional regulator or/and post-transcriptional regulator in rna induced silencing complex , which is guided by small rnas to repress target genes expression. previously, it was revealed that  <dig> putative ago genes in tomato genome.


RESULTS
in present study, out of  <dig> detected slago genes, only slago4c and slago <dig> couldn’t be detected in roots, stems, leaves, buds, flowers and fruit of tomato by  <dig> cycles of pcr. slago <dig> could be detected in early stage of fruit , but it was significantly down-regulated in fruit collected on the  <dig> days post anthesis. moreover, slago <dig> could only be detected in reproductive tissues and slago4d was specifically detected in fruit. according to blast result with mirna database, three slago genes harbored complementary sequences to mir <dig>  or mir <dig> . 5′ race  mapping was used to detect the 3′ cleavage products of slago mrnas. in addition, subcellular localization of slago proteins was detected. our results showed that most slago proteins localized to nucleus and cytoplasm. importantly, nuclear membrane localization of ago proteins was observed. furthermore, mutated mir <dig> complementary site of slago1a resulted in expanded localization of slago1a, indicating that mir <dig> regulated localization of slago1a.


CONCLUSIONS
our results contribute to demonstration of potential roles of these newly isolated ago family in tomato developmental processes and proved the conserved relationships between ago genes and mirnas in tomato, which might play important roles in tomato development and virus defense.
