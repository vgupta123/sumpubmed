BACKGROUND
freezing lesions to developing rat cortex induced between postnatal day  one and three  lead to malformations similar to human microgyria, and further correspond to reductions in brain weight and cortical volume. in contrast, comparable lesions on p <dig> do not produce microgyric malformations, nor the changes in brain weight seen with microgyria. however, injury occurring at all three ages does lead to rapid auditory processing deficits as measured in the juvenile period. interestingly, these deficits persist into adulthood only in the p <dig> lesion case  <cit> . given prior evidence that early focal cortical lesions induce abnormalities in cortical morphology and connectivity  <cit> , we hypothesized that the differential behavioral effects of focal cortical lesions on p <dig>  p <dig> or p <dig> may be associated with underlying neuroanatomical changes that are sensitive to timing of injury. clinical studies indicate that humans with perinatal brain injury often show regional reductions in corpus callosum size and abnormal symmetry, which frequently correspond to learning impairments  <cit> . therefore, in the current study the brains of p <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> lesion rats, previously evaluated for brain weight, and cortical volume changes and auditory processing impairments , were further analyzed for changes in corpus callosum volume.


RESULTS
results showed a significant main effect of treatment on corpus callosum volume , with lesion subjects showing significantly smaller callosal volumes as compared to shams. an age at treatment Ã— treatment interaction , indicated that corpus callosum size decreased as the age of injury decreased from p <dig> to p <dig>  simple effects analysis showed significant differences between p <dig> and p <dig> , and p <dig> and p <dig> , subjects. rats with p <dig> injury resulting in microgyria had the greatest reduction in corpus callosum volume , followed by the p <dig> group , which showed a significant reduction in corpus callosum volume compared to shams . finally, the p <dig> lesion group did not significantly differ from the sham subjects in callosal volume.


CONCLUSIONS
decrements in corpus callosum volume in the p <dig> and  <dig> lesion groups are consistent with the reductions in brain weight and cortical volume previously reported for microgyric rats  <cit> . current results suggest that disruption to the cortical plate during early postnatal development may lead to more widely dispersed neurovolumetric anomalies and subsequent behavioral impairments  <cit> , compared with injury that occurs later in development. further, these results suggest that in a human clinical setting decreased corpus callosum volume may represent an additional marker for long-term behavioral outcome.
