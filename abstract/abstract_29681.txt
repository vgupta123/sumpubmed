BACKGROUND
heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins , composed of gα, gβ, and gγ subunits, are positioned at the inner face of the plasma membrane and relay signals from activated g protein-coupled cell surface receptors to various signaling pathways. gβ <dig> is the most structurally divergent gβ isoform and forms tight heterodimers with regulator of g protein signalling  proteins of the r <dig> subfamily . the subcellular localization of gβ 5/r7-rgs protein complexes is regulated by the palmitoylation status of the associated r7-binding protein , a recently discovered snare-like protein. we investigate here whether r7bp controls the targeting of gβ5/r7-rgs complexes to lipid rafts, cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains where conventional heterotrimeric g proteins and some effector proteins are concentrated in neurons and brain.


RESULTS
we show that endogenous gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp protein complexes are present in native neuron-like pc <dig> cells and that a fraction is targeted to low-density, detergent-resistant membrane lipid rafts. the buoyant density of endogenous raft-associated gβ5/r7-rgs protein complexes in pc <dig> cells was similar to that of lipid rafts containing the palmitoylated marker proteins psd- <dig> and lat, but distinct from that of the membrane microdomain where flotillin was localized. overexpression of wild-type r7bp, but not its palmitoylation-deficient mutant, greatly enriched the fraction of endogenous gβ5/r7-rgs protein complexes in the lipid rafts. in hek- <dig> cells the palmitoylation status of r7bp also regulated the lipid raft targeting of co-expressed gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp proteins. a fraction of endogenous gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complexes was also present in lipid rafts in mouse brain.


CONCLUSIONS
a fraction of gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp protein complexes is targeted to low-density, detergent-resistant membrane lipid rafts in pc <dig> cells and brain. in cultured cells, the palmitoylation status of r7bp regulated the lipid raft targeting of endogenous or co-expressed gβ5/r7-rgs proteins. taken together with recent evidence that the kinetic effects of the gβ <dig> complex on gpcr signaling are greatly enhanced by r7bp palmitoylation through a membrane-anchoring mechanism, our data suggest the targeting of the gβ5/r7-rgs/r7bp complex to lipid rafts in neurons and brain, where g proteins and their effectors are concentrated, may be central to the g protein regulatory function of the complex.
