BACKGROUND
local circulatory disturbances have been implicated in the development of foot disorders in cattle. the goals of this study were to evaluate the suitability of the interdigital artery in the pastern region in both hind limbs using pulsed-wave  doppler ultrasonography and to investigate quantitative arterial blood flow variables at that site in dairy cows. an esaote mylabone ultrasound machine with a 10-mhz linear transducer was used to assess blood flow in the interdigital artery in the pastern region in both hind limbs of  <dig> healthy german holstein cows. the cows originated from three commercial farms and were restrained in a standing hoof trimming chute without sedation.


RESULTS
a pw doppler signal suitable for analysis was obtained in  <dig> of  <dig> cows. the blood flow profiles were categorised into four curve types, and the following quantitative variables were measured in three uniform cardiac cycles: vessel diameter, pulse rate, maximum systolic velocity, maximum diastolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, reverse velocity, maximum time-averaged mean velocity, blood flow rate, resistance index and persistence index. the measurements did not differ among cows from the three farms. maximum systolic velocity, vessel diameter and pulse rate did not differ but other variables differed significantly among blood flow profiles.


CONCLUSIONS
differences in weight-bearing are thought to be responsible for the normal variability of blood flow profiles in healthy cows. the scanning technique used in this report for evaluation of blood flow in the interdigital artery appears suitable for further investigations in healthy and in lame cows.
