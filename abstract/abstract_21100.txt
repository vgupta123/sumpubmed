BACKGROUND
antisense transcription is a widespread phenomenon in plants and mammals. our previous data on rice gene expression analysis by microarray indicated that the sense and antisense transcripts at the osdof <dig> locus were co-expressed in leaves. in current study, we analyzed the expression patterns in detail and looked for the possible mechanism related to their expression patterns.


RESULTS
osdof <dig>  being a single copy gene located on rice chromosome  <dig>  encodes a predicted dof protein of  <dig> amino acids with one intron of  <dig> bp. the antisense transcript, osdofl2os, overlaps with both the exonic and intronic regions of osdof <dig> and encodes a functionally unknown protein of  <dig> amino acids with no intron. the sense-antisense osdof <dig> transcripts were co-expressed within the same tissues, and their expressions were not tissue-specific in general. at different developmental stages in rice, the osdof <dig> and osdof12os transcripts exhibited reciprocal expression patterns. interestingly, the expression of both genes was significantly induced under drought treatment, and inhibited by dark treatment. in the proosdof12-gus and proosdof12os-gus transgenic rice plants, the expression profiles of gus were consistent with those of the osdof <dig> and osdof12os transcripts, respectively. in addition, the analysis of cis-regulatory elements indicated that either of the two promoters contained  <dig> classes of cis-regulatory elements predicted, of which the two promoter regions shared  <dig> classes.


CONCLUSIONS
based on the expression profiles of osdof <dig> and osdof12os, the expression patterns of gus in the proosdof12-gus and proosdof12os-gus transgenic rice plants and the predicted common cis-regulatory elements shared by the two promoters, we suggest that the co-expression patterns of osdof <dig> and osdof12os might be attributed to the basically common nature of the two promoters.
