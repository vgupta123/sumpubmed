BACKGROUND
horses and humans share a natural proclivity for athletic performance. in this respect, horses can be considered a reference species in studies designed to optimize physical training and disease prevention. in both species, interleukin- <dig>  plays a major role in regulating the inflammatory process induced during exercise as part of an integrated metabolic regulatory network. the aim of this study was to compare il- <dig> and il- <dig> receptor  mrna expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells  in trained and untrained humans and horses.


RESULTS
nine highly trained male swimmers  were compared with two age-matched control groups represented by eight lightly trained runners  and nine untrained subjects. in addition, eight trained horses  were compared with eight age-matched sedentary mares. in humans, il- <dig> mrna levels in pbmcs determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were significantly higher in highly trained subjects, whereas il-6r expression did not differ among groups. in horses, transcripts of both il- <dig> and il-6r were significantly up-regulated in the trained group.


CONCLUSIONS
up-regulation of il-6r expression in pbmcs in horses could reflect a mechanism that maintains an adequate anti-inflammatory environment at rest through ubiquitous production of anti-inflammatory cytokines throughout the body. these findings suggest that the system that controls the inflammatory response in horses is better adapted to respond to exercise than that in humans.
