BACKGROUND
the extracellular domains of cytokine receptors are released during inflammation, but little is known about the shedding of toll-like receptors  and whether they can be used as diagnostic biomarkers.

methods
the release of stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> was studied in in-vitro stimulations, as well as in-vivo during experimental human endotoxemia , and in plasma of  <dig> patients with infections  or non-infectious inflammation . using c-statistics, the value of stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> levels for discrimination between infections and non-infectious inflammatory diseases, as well as between viral and bacterial infections was analyzed.


RESULTS
in-vitro, peripheral blood mononuclear cells released stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> by exposure to microbial ligands. during experimental human endotoxemia, plasma concentrations peaked after 2 hours  and 4 hours . stlr <dig> did not correlate with cytokines, but stlr <dig> correlated positively with tnfα , il- <dig> , and il-1ra , and negatively with il- <dig> , respectively. stlr <dig> had a similar area under the roc curve  for differentiating infectious and non-infectious inflammation compared to crp:  <dig>   versus  <dig>   , while stlr <dig> had a lower auc:  <dig>   . crp differentiated bacterial infections better from viral infections than stlr <dig> and stlr4: auc  <dig>   versus  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively .


CONCLUSIONS
stlrs are released into the circulation, and suggest the possibility to use stlrs as diagnostic tool in inflammatory conditions.
