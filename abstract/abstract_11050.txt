BACKGROUND
porcine circovirus type  <dig>  is associated with post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome  in pigs. currently, there is considerable interest in the immunology of pcv2; in particular, the immunological properties of the capsid protein. this protein is involved in pcv <dig> immunogenicity and is a potential target for vaccine development. in this study, we identified one critical amino acid that determines a conformational neutralizing epitope in the capsid protein of pcv <dig> 


RESULTS
one monoclonal antibody , against the capsid protein of pcv <dig>  was generated and characterized in this study. 8e <dig> reacted with the genotype pcv2a  strains but not pcv2b  strains by an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay  and a capture elisa. furthermore, the mab had the capacity to neutralize pcv2a  strains but not pcv2b  strains. one critical amino acid that determined a conformational neutralizing epitope was identified using mab 8e <dig> and pcv <dig> infectious clone technique. amino acid residues 47- <dig> in the capsid protein of pcv2a/cl were replaced with the corresponding region of pcv2b/yj, and the reactivity of mab 8e <dig> was lost. further experiments demonstrated that one amino acid substitution, the alanine for arginine at position  <dig>  in the capsid protein of pcv2a  strains, inhibited completely the immunoreactivity of three pcv2a strains with mab 8e <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
it is concluded that the alanine at position  <dig> in the capsid protein of pcv2a  strains is a critical amino acid, which determines one neutralizing epitope of pcv2a  strains. this study provides valuable information for further in-depth mapping of the conformational neutralizing epitope, understanding antigenic difference among pcv <dig> strains, and development of a useful vaccine for control of pcv2-associated disease.
