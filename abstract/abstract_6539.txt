BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a class of short regulatory rnas encoded in the genome of dna viruses, some single cell organisms, plants and animals. with the rapid development of technology, more and more mirnas are being discovered. however, the origin and evolution of most mirnas remain obscure. here we report the origin and evolution dynamics of a human mirna family.


RESULTS
we have shown that all members of the mir- <dig> family are derived from mer <dig> elements. although the conservation scores of the mer53-derived pre-mirna sequences are low, we have identified  <dig> potential paralogs of mer53-derived mir- <dig> genes in the human genome and  <dig> potential orthologs of the human mir- <dig> family in placental mammals. we suggest that in placental species, this mirna family has evolved following the birth-and-death model of evolution. three possible mechanisms that can mediate mirna duplication in evolutionary history have been proposed: the transposition of the mer <dig> element, segmental duplications and alu-mediated recombination. finally, we have found that the target genes of mir- <dig> are over-represented in transportation, localization, and system development processes and in the positive regulation of cellular processes. many of them are predicted to function in binding and transcription regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
the members of mir- <dig> family that are derived from mer <dig> elements are placental-specific mirnas. they emerged at the early stage of the recent  <dig> million years since eutherian mammals diverged from marsupials. under the birth-and-death model, the mir- <dig> genes have experienced a complex expansion with some members evolving by segmental duplications and some by alu-mediated recombination events.
