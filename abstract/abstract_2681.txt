BACKGROUND
an outbreak of salmonella kentucky followed by a high level of sustained endemic prevalence was recently observed in a us adult dairy herd enrolled in a longitudinal study involving intensive fecal sampling. to understand the invasion ability and transmission dynamics of salmonella kentucky in dairy cattle, accurate estimation of the key epidemiological parameters from longitudinal field data is necessary. the approximate bayesian computation technique was applied for estimating the transmission rate , the recovery rate  and shape  parameters of the gamma distribution for the infectious  period, and the basic reproduction ratio , given a susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible  compartment model with a gamma distribution for the infectious period.


RESULTS
the results report that the mean transmission rate  is  <dig>  month- <dig> , the average infectious period  is  <dig>  months , the mean shape parameter  of the gamma distribution for the infectious period is  <dig> , and the mean basic reproduction ratio  is  <dig>  .


CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that salmonella kentucky in this herd was of mild infectiousness and had a long infectious period, which together provide an explanation for the observed prevalence pattern after invasion. the transmission rate and the recovery rate parameters are inferred with better accuracy than the shape parameter, therefore these two parameters are more sensitive to the model and the observed data. the estimated shape parameter  has large variability with a minimal value greater than one, indicating that the infectious period of salmonella kentucky in dairy cattle does not follow the conventionally assumed exponential distribution.
