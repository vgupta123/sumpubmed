BACKGROUND
the gaussia princeps luciferase is used as a stand-alone reporter of transgene expression for in vitro and in vivo expression systems due to the rapid and easy monitoring of luciferase activity. we sought to simultaneously quantitate production of other recombinant proteins by transcriptionally linking the gaussia princeps luciferase gene to other genes of interest through the foot-and-mouth disease virus 2a translational interrupter sequence.


RESULTS
we produced six plasmids, each encoding a single open reading frame, with the foot-and-mouth disease virus 2a sequence placed either n-terminal or c-terminal to the gaussia princeps luciferase gene. two plasmids included novel gaussia princeps luciferase variants with the position  <dig> methionine deleted. placing a foot-and-mouth disease virus 2a translational interrupter sequence on either the n- or c-terminus of the gaussia princeps luciferase gene did not prevent the secretion or luminescence of resulting chimeric luciferase proteins. we also measured the ability of another polycistronic plasmid vector with a 2a-luciferase sequence placed downstream of the foot-and-mouth disease virus p <dig> and 3c protease genes to produce of foot-and-mouth disease virus-like particles and luciferase activity from transfected cells. incorporation of the 2a-luciferase sequence into a transgene encoding foot-and-mouth disease virus structural proteins retained luciferase activity and the ability to form virus-like particles.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated a mechanism for the near real-time, sequential, non-destructive quantitative monitoring of transcriptionally-linked recombinant proteins and a valuable method for monitoring transgene expression in recombinant vaccine constructs.
