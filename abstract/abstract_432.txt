BACKGROUND
quantum dots  have been considered as a new and efficient probe for labeling cells non-invasively in vitro and in vivo, but fairly little is known about how qds are eliminated from cells after labeling. the purpose of this study is to investigate the metabolism of qds in different type of cells.


RESULTS
mouse embryonic stem cells  and mouse embryonic fibroblasts  were labeled with qd  <dig>  qd-labeling was monitored by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry for  <dig> hours. both types of cells were labeled efficiently, but a quick loss of qd-labeling in escs was observed within  <dig> hours, which was not prevented by inhibiting cell proliferation. transmission electron microscope analysis showed a dramatic decrease of qd number in vesicles of escs at  <dig> hours post-labeling, suggesting that qds might be degraded. in addition, supernatants collected from labeled escs in culture were used to label cells again, indicating that some qds were excreted from cells.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study to demonstrate that the metabolism of qds in different type of cells is different. qds were quickly degraded or excreted from escs after labeling.
