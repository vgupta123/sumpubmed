BACKGROUND
g-protein-coupled receptors  are important drug targets and a better understanding of their molecular mechanisms would be desirable. the crystallization rate of gpcrs has accelerated in recent years as techniques have become more sophisticated, particularly with respect to class a gpcrs interacting with g-proteins. these developments have made it possible for a quantitative analysis of gpcr geometrical features and binding-site conformations, including a statistical comparison between class a gpcrs in active  and inactive  states.


RESULTS
here we implement algorithms for the analysis of interhelical angles, distances, interactions and binding-site volumes in the transmembrane domains of  <dig> class a gpcrs . two interhelical angles change in a statistically significant way between average inactive and active states: tm3-tm <dig>  and tm6-tm <dig> . a third interhelical angle: tm5-tm <dig> shows a trend, changing by -9°. in the transition from inactive to active states, average van der waals interactions between tm <dig> and tm <dig> significantly increase as the average distance between them decreases by > <dig> Å. average h-bonding between tm <dig> and tm <dig> decreases but is seemingly compensated by an increase in h-bonding between tm <dig> and tm <dig>  in five class a gpcrs, crystallized in both active and inactive states, increased h-bonding of agonists to tm <dig> and tm <dig>  relative to antagonists, is observed. these protein-agonist interactions likely favour a change in the tm6-tm <dig> angle, which creates a narrowing in the binding pocket of activated receptors and an average ~ <dig> Å <dig> reduction in volume.


CONCLUSIONS
in terms of similar conformational changes and agonist binding pattern, class a gpcrs appear to share a common mechanism of activation, which can be exploited in future drug development.
