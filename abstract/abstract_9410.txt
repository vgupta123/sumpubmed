BACKGROUND
cholesterol oxidases are important enzymes for applications such as the analysis of cholesterol in clinical samples, the synthesis of steroid derived drugs, and are considered as potential antibacterial drug targets.


RESULTS
the gene choa encoding a cholesterol oxidase from chryseobacterium gleum dsm  <dig> was cloned into the pqe- <dig> expression vector and heterologously expressed in escherichia coli jm <dig> co-transformed with prare <dig>  the n-terminally his-tagged cholesterol oxidase  was assigned to be a monomer in solution by size exclusion chromatography, showed a temperature optimum of 35°c, and a ph optimum at  <dig>  using  <dig>  m mops buffer under the tested conditions. the purified protein showed a maximum activity of  <dig>  u/mg. cgchoa showed a michaelis-menten like kinetic behavior only when the substrate was dissolved in water and taurocholate . in addition, the conversion of cholesterol by cgchoa was studied via biocatalytic batches at analytical scale, and cholest-4-en-3-one was confirmed as product by hplc-ms.


CONCLUSIONS
cgchoa is a true cholesterol oxidase which activity ranges among the high performing described cholesterol oxidases from other organisms. thus, the enzyme broadens the available toolbox of cholesterol oxidases for e.g. synthetic and biosensing applications.
