BACKGROUND
the developing vertebrate hindbrain is transiently segmented into rhombomeres by a process requiring hox activity. hox genes control specification of rhombomere fates, as well as the stereotypic differentiation of rhombomere-specific neuronal populations. accordingly, germ line disruption of the paralog group  <dig>  hox genes hoxa <dig> and hoxb <dig> causes defects in hindbrain segmentation and neuron formation in mice. however, antisense-mediated interference with zebrafish hoxb1a and hoxb1b  produces phenotypes that are qualitatively and quantitatively distinct from those observed in the mouse. this suggests that pg <dig> hox genes may have species-specific functions, or that anti-sense mediated interference may not completely inactivate hox function in zebrafish.


RESULTS
using zinc finger and talen technologies, we disrupted hoxb1a and hoxb1b in the zebrafish germ line to establish mutant lines for each gene. we find that zebrafish hoxb1a germ line mutants have a more severe phenotype than reported for hoxb1a antisense treatment. this phenotype is similar to that observed in hoxb <dig> knock out mice, suggesting that hoxb1/hoxb1a have the same function in both species. zebrafish hoxb1b germ line mutants also have a more severe phenotype than reported for hoxb1b antisense treatment , but this phenotype differs from that observed in hoxa <dig> knock out mice  and r6), suggesting that hoxa1/hoxb1b have species-specific activities. we also demonstrate that hoxb1b regulates nucleosome organization at the hoxb1a promoter and that retinoic acid acts independently of hoxb1b to activate hoxb1a expression.


CONCLUSIONS
we generated several novel germ line mutants for zebrafish hoxb1a and hoxb1b. our analyses indicate that hoxb <dig> and hoxb1a have comparable functions in zebrafish and mouse, suggesting a conserved function for these genes. in contrast, while hoxa <dig> and hoxb1b share functions in the formation of r <dig> and r <dig>  they differ with regards to r <dig> and r <dig>  where hoxa <dig> appears to control formation of r <dig>  but not r <dig>  in the mouse, whereas hoxb1b regulates formation of r <dig>  but not r <dig>  in zebrafish. lastly, our data reveal independent regulation of hoxb1a expression by retinoic acid and hoxb1b in zebrafish.
