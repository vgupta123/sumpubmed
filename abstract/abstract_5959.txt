BACKGROUND
a major challenge in computational biology is to extract knowledge about the genetic nature of disease from high-throughput data. however, an important obstacle to both biological understanding and clinical applications is the "black box" nature of the decision rules provided by most machine learning approaches, which usually involve many genes combined in a highly complex fashion. achieving biologically relevant results argues for a different strategy. a promising alternative is to base prediction entirely upon the relative expression ordering of a small number of genes.


RESULTS
we present a three-gene version of "relative expression analysis" , a rigorous and systematic comparison with earlier approaches in a variety of cancer studies, a clinically relevant application to predicting germline brca <dig> mutations in breast cancer and a cross-study validation for predicting er status. in the brca <dig> study, rxa yields high accuracy with a simple decision rule: in tumors carrying mutations, the expression of a "reference gene" falls between the expression of two differentially expressed genes, ppp1cb and rnf <dig>  an analysis of the protein-protein interactions among the triplet of genes and brca <dig> suggests that the classifier has a biological foundation.


CONCLUSIONS
rxa has the potential to identify genomic "marker interactions" with plausible biological interpretation and direct clinical applicability. it provides a general framework for understanding the roles of the genes involved in decision rules, as illustrated for the difficult and clinically relevant problem of identifying brca <dig> mutation carriers.
