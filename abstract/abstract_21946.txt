BACKGROUND
since darwin's pioneering work, evolutionary changes in isolated island populations of vertebrates have continued to provide the strongest evidence for the theory of natural selection. besides macro-evolutionary changes, micro-evolutionary changes and the relative importance of natural selection vs. genetic drift are under intense investigation. our study focuses on the genetic differentiation in morphological and life-history traits in insular populations of a small mammal the bank vole myodes glareolus.


RESULTS
our results do not support the earlier findings for larger adult size or lower reproductive effort in insular populations of small mammals. however, the individuals living on islands produced larger offspring than individuals living on the mainland. genetic differentiation in offspring size was further confirmed by the analyses of quantitative genetics in lab. in insular populations, genetic differentiation in offspring size simultaneously decreases the additive genetic variation  for that trait. furthermore, our analyses of differentiation in neutral marker loci  indicate that va is less than expected on the basis of genetic drift alone, and thus, a lower va in insular populations could be caused by natural selection.


CONCLUSIONS
we believe that different selection pressures  in an insular environment might favour larger offspring size in small mammals. island selection for larger offspring could be the preliminary mechanism in a process which could eventually lead to a smaller litter size and lower reproductive effort frequently found in insular vertebrates.
