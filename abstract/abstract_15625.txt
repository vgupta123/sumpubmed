BACKGROUND
to date, the earliest stage at which the orientation of the anterior-posterior axis in the mouse embryo is distinguishable by asymmetric gene expression is shortly after e <dig> . at e <dig> , prospective anterior markers are expressed at the distal tip of the embryo, whereas prospective posterior markers are expressed more proximally, close to the boundary with the extraembryonic region.


RESULTS
to contribute to elucidating the mechanisms underlying the events involved in early patterning of the mouse embryo, we have carried out a microarray screen to identify novel genes that are differentially expressed between the distal and proximal parts of the e <dig>  embryo. secondary screening of resulting candidates by in situ hybridisation at e <dig>  and e <dig>  revealed novel expression patterns for known and previously uncharacterised genes, including peg <dig>  ctsz <dig>  cubilin, jarid1b, ndrg <dig>  sfmbt <dig>  gjb <dig>  talia and plet <dig>  the previously undescribed gene talia and recently identified plet <dig> are expressed specifically in the distal-most part of the extraembryonic ectoderm, adjacent to the epiblast, and are therefore potential candidates for regulating early patterning events. talia and the previously described gene xe <dig> define a gene family highly conserved among metazoans and with a predicted protein structure suggestive of a post-transcriptional regulative function, whilst plet <dig> appears to be mammal-specific and of unknown function.


CONCLUSIONS
our approach has allowed us to compare expression between dissected parts of the egg cylinder and has identified multiple genes with novel expression patterns at this developmental stage. these genes are potential candidates for regulating tissue interactions following implantation.
