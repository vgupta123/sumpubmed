BACKGROUND
the differentiation of naive cd 4+ helper t  cells into effector th <dig> cells is steered by extracellular cytokines that activate and control the lineage specific transcriptional program. while the inducing cytokine signals and core transcription factors driving the differentiation towards th <dig> lineage are well known, detailed mechanistic interactions between the key components are poorly understood.


RESULTS
we develop an integrative modeling framework which combines rna sequencing data with mathematical modeling and enables us to construct a mechanistic model for the core th <dig> regulatory network in a data-driven manner.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show significant evidence, for instance, for inhibitory mechanisms between the transcription factors and reveal a previously unknown dependency between the dosage of the inducing cytokine tgf β and the expression of the master regulator of competing  regulatory t cell lineage. further, our experimental validation approves this dependency in th <dig> polarizing conditions.
