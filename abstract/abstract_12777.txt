BACKGROUND
influenza neuraminidase  is an important target for antiviral inhibitors since its active site is highly conserved such that inhibitors can be cross-reactive against multiple types and subtypes of influenza. here, we discuss the crystal structure of neuraminidase subtype n <dig> complexed with a new benzoic acid based inhibitor  that was designed to add contacts by overpacking one side of the active site pocket. inhibitor  <dig> uses benzoic acid to mimic the pyranose ring, a bis--substituted 2-pyrrolidinone ring in place of the n-acetyl group of the sialic acid, and a branched aliphatic structure to fill the sialic acid c <dig> subsite.


RESULTS
inhibitor  <dig> {4--3-benzoic acid} was soaked into crystals of neuraminidase of a/tern/australia/g70c/ <dig> , and the structure refined with  <dig>  Å x-ray data. the benzene ring of the inhibitor tilted  <dig> ° compared to the previous compound , and the number of contacts, including hydrogen bonds, increased. however, the ic <dig> for compound  <dig> remained in the low micromolar range, likely because one propyl group was disordered. in this high-resolution structure of na isolated from virus grown in chicken eggs, we found electron density for additional sugar units on the n-linked glycans compared to previous neuraminidase structures. in particular, seven mannoses and two n-acetylglucosamines are visible in the glycan attached to asn <dig>  this long, branched high-mannose glycan makes significant contacts with the neighboring subunit.


CONCLUSIONS
we designed inhibitor  <dig> with an extended substituent at c4-corresponding to c <dig> of sialic acid-to increase the contact surface in the c6-subsite and to force the benzene ring to tilt to maximize these interactions while retaining the interactions of the carboxylate and the pyrolidinone substituents. the crystal structure at  <dig>  Å showed that we partially succeeded in that the ring in  <dig> is tilted relative to  <dig> and the number of contacts increased, but one hydrophobic branch makes no contacts, perhaps explaining why the ic <dig> did not decrease. future design efforts will include branches of unequal length so that both branches may be accommodated in the c6-subsite without conformational disorder. the high-mannose glycan attached to asn <dig> makes several inter-subunit contacts and appears to stabilize the tetramer.
