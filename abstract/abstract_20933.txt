BACKGROUND
dna polymerase δ plays an essential role in chromosomal dna replication in eukaryotic cells, being responsible for synthesising the bulk of the lagging strand. in fission yeast, pol δ is a heterotetrameric enzyme comprising four evolutionarily well-conserved proteins: the catalytic subunit pol <dig> and three smaller subunits cdc <dig>  cdc <dig> and cdm <dig>  pol <dig> binds directly to the b-subunit, cdc <dig>  which in turn binds the c-subunit, cdc <dig>  human pol δ comprises the same four subunits, and the crystal structure was recently reported of a complex of human p <dig> and the n-terminal domain of p <dig>  the human orthologues of cdc <dig> and cdc <dig>  respectively.


RESULTS
to gain insights into the structure and function of cdc <dig>  random and directed mutagenesis techniques were used to create a collection of thirty alleles encoding mutant cdc <dig> proteins. each allele was tested for function in fission yeast and for binding of the altered protein to pol <dig> and cdc <dig> using the two-hybrid system. additionally, the locations of the amino acid changes in each protein were mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of human p <dig>  the results obtained from these studies identify amino acid residues and regions within the cdc <dig> protein that are essential for interaction with pol <dig> and cdc <dig> and for in vivo function. mutations specifically defective in pol3-cdc <dig> interactions allow the identification of a possible pol <dig> binding surface on cdc <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
in the absence of a three-dimensional structure of the entire pol δ complex, the results of this study highlight regions in cdc <dig> that are vital for protein function in vivo and provide valuable clues to possible protein-protein interaction surfaces on the cdc <dig> protein that will be important targets for further study.
