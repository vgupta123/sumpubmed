BACKGROUND
the identification of drug characteristics is a clinically important task, but it requires much expert knowledge and consumes substantial resources. we have developed a statistical text-mining approach  to help experts screen drugs that may have important clinical characteristics of interest.


RESULTS
bicepp first retrieves medline abstracts containing drug names, then selects tokens that best predict the list of drugs which represents the characteristic of interest. machine learning is then used to classify drugs using a document frequency-based measure. evaluation experiments were performed to validate bicepp's performance on  <dig> characteristics of  <dig> drugs, identified from the australian medicines handbook  and the pharmacokinetic interaction screening  database. stratified cross-validations revealed that bicepp was able to classify drugs into all  <dig> major therapeutic classes  and  <dig>  minor drug classes  with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve  >  <dig> . similarly, auc >  <dig>  could be obtained in the classification of  <dig>  adverse events , up to  <dig>  groups of clinically significant cytochrome p <dig> enzyme  inducers or inhibitors , and up to  <dig>  groups of narrow therapeutic index drugs . interestingly, it was observed that the keywords used to describe a drug characteristic were not necessarily the most predictive ones for the classification task.


CONCLUSIONS
bicepp has sufficient classification power to automatically distinguish a wide range of clinical properties of drugs. this may be used in pharmacovigilance applications to assist with rapid screening of large drug databases to identify important characteristics for further evaluation.
