BACKGROUND
chlamydophila pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular bacterium that replicates in a biphasic life cycle within eukaryotic host cells. four published genomes revealed an identity of >  <dig> %. this remarkable finding raised questions about the existence of distinguishable genotypes in correlation with geographical and anatomical origin.


RESULTS
we studied the genetic diversity of c. pneumoniae by analysing synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms  that are under reduced selection pressure. we conducted an in silico analysis of the four sequenced genomes, chose  <dig> representative ssnps and analysed the loci in  <dig> c. pneumoniae isolates. we identified  <dig> different genotypes that were separated in four major clusters. clusters were not associated with anatomical or geographical origin. however, animal lineages are basal on the c. pneumomiae phylogeny, suggesting a recent transmission to humans through successive bottlenecks some  <dig>  years ago. a lack of detectable variation in  <dig> isolates emphasizes the extraordinary genetic conservation of this species and the high clonality of the population. moreover, the largest cluster, which encompasses 80% of all analysed strains, is an extremely young clade, that went through an important population expansion some  <dig>  years ago.


CONCLUSIONS
ssnps have proven useful as a sensitive marker to gain new insights into genetic diversity, population structure and evolutionary history of c. pneumoniae.
