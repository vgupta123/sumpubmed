BACKGROUND
the changes in t-cell morphology during immunological synapse  formation are essential for t-cell activation. previous researches have shown that t cell changed from spherical to elongated and/or flattened during in contact with b cell. as most powerful antigen presenting cell, dendritic cell  has a strong ability to activate t cells. however, the morphological change of t cell which contacts dc and the relationship between morphological change and t-cell activation are not very clear. thus, we studied the morphological change of cd4+ t cell during contact with dc.


RESULTS
using live-cell imaging, we discovered diversity in the t-cell morphological changes during contact with dcs. the elongation-flattening of cd4+ t cells correlated with a low-level ca2+ response and a loss of t-cell receptor  signalling molecules in the is, including zeta-chain associated protein kinase  <dig> , phospholipase c-γ  and protein kinase c-θ , whereas rounding-flattening correlated with sufficient cd4+ t-cell activation. different morphological changes were correlated with the different amount of accumulated filamentous actin  in the is. disruption of f-actin by cytochalasin d impaired the morphological change and the localisation of calcium microdomains in the is and decreased the calcium response in cd4+ t cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our study discovered the diversity in morphological change of t cells during contacted with dcs. during this process, the different morphological changes of t cells modulate t-cell activation by the different amount of f-actin accumulation in the is, which controls the distribution of calcium microdomains to affect t-cell activation.
