BACKGROUND
the genus brassica includes the most extensively cultivated vegetable crops worldwide. investigation of the brassica genome presents excellent challenges to study plant genome evolution and divergence of gene function associated with polyploidy and genome hybridization. a physical map of the b. rapa genome is a fundamental tool for analysis of brassica "a" genome structure. integration of a physical map with an existing genetic map by linking genetic markers and bac clones in the sequencing pipeline provides a crucial resource for the ongoing genome sequencing effort and assembly of whole genome sequences.


RESULTS
a genome-wide physical map of the b. rapa genome was constructed by the capillary electrophoresis-based fingerprinting of  <dig>  bacterial artificial chromosome  clones using the five restriction enzyme snapshot technique. the clones were assembled into contigs by means of fpc v <dig> . <dig>  after contig validation and manual editing, the resulting contig assembly consists of  <dig>  contigs and is estimated to span  <dig> mb in physical length. this map provides  <dig> anchored contigs on  <dig> linkage groups to be served as seed points from which to continue bidirectional chromosome extension for genome sequencing.


CONCLUSIONS
the map reported here is the first physical map for brassica "a" genome based on the high information content fingerprinting  technique. this physical map will serve as a fundamental genomic resource for accelerating genome sequencing, assembly of bac sequences, and comparative genomics between brassica genomes. the current build of the b. rapa physical map is available at the b. rapa genome project website for the user community.
