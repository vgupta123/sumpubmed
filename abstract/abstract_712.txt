BACKGROUND
recent molecular hypotheses suggest that some traditional suprageneric taxa of characiformes require revision, as they may not constitute monophyletic groups. this is the case for the bryconidae. various studies have proposed that this family  may be composed of different genera. however, until now, no phylogenetic study of all putative genera has been conducted.


RESULTS
in the present study, we analyzed  <dig> species  of all currently recognized genera of the bryconidae  and  <dig> species representing all other families and most genera of the characiformes . five genes were sequenced: 16srrna, cytochrome b, recombination activating gene  <dig> and  <dig> and myosin heavy chain  <dig> cardiac muscle. the final matrix contained  <dig> bp and was analyzed by maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and bayesian analyses. the results show that the bryconidae, composed of brycon, chilobrycon, henochilus and salminus, is monophyletic and is the sister group of gasteropelecidae + triportheidae. however, the genus brycon is polyphyletic. fossil studies suggest that the family originated approximately  <dig> million years ago  and that one of the two main lineages persisted only in trans-andean rivers, including central american rivers, suggesting a much older origin of mesoamerican ichthyofauna than previously accepted.


CONCLUSIONS
bryconidae is composed by five main clades, including the genera brycon, chilobrycon, henochilus and salminus, but a taxonomic review of these groups is needed. our results point to a possible ancient invasion of central america, dating about  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ma , to explain the occurrence of brycon in central america.
