BACKGROUND
panicoideae are the second largest subfamily in poaceae , with  <dig> genera and approximately  <dig> species. previous studies have begun to reveal relationships within the subfamily, but largely lack resolution and/or robust support for certain tribal and subtribal groups. this study aims to resolve these relationships, as well as characterize a putative mitochondrial insert in one linage.


RESULTS
 <dig> newly sequenced panicoideae plastomes were combined in a phylogenomic study with  <dig> other species:  <dig> panicoideae and  <dig> from outgroups. a robust panicoideae topology largely congruent with previous studies was obtained, but with some incongruences with previously reported subtribal relationships. a mitochondrial dna  to plastid dna  transfer was discovered in the paspalum lineage.


CONCLUSIONS
the phylogenomic analysis returned a topology that largely supports previous studies. five previously recognized subtribes appear on the topology to be non-monophyletic. additionally, evidence for mtdna to ptdna transfer was identified in both paspalum fimbriatum and p. dilatatum, and suggests a single rare event that took place in a common progenitor. finally, the framework from this study can guide larger whole plastome sampling to discern the relationships in cyperochloeae, steyermarkochloeae, gynerieae, and other incertae sedis taxa that are weakly supported or unresolved.
