BACKGROUND
progressive diversification of paralogs after gene expansion is essential to increase their functional specialization. however, mode and tempo of this divergence remain mostly unclear. here we report the comparative analysis of prdm genes, a family of putative transcriptional regulators involved in human tumorigenesis.


RESULTS
our analysis assessed that the prdm genes originated in metazoans, expanded in vertebrates and further duplicated in primates. we experimentally showed that fast-evolving paralogs are poorly expressed, and that the most recent duplicates, such as primate-specific prdm <dig>  acquire tissue-specificity. prdm <dig> underwent major structural rearrangements that decreased the number of encoded zn-fingers and modified gene splicing. through internal duplication and activation of a non-canonical splice site , prdm <dig> can acquire a novel intron. we also detected an alternative isoform that can retain the intron in the mature transcript and that is predominantly expressed in human melanocytes.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings show that  molecular evolution of paralogs correlates with their expression pattern;  gene diversification is obtained through massive genomic rearrangements; and  splicing modification contributes to the functional specialization of novel genes.
