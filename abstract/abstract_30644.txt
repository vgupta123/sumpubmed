BACKGROUND
clpb-cyt/hsp <dig> protein acts as chaperone, mediating disaggregation of denatured proteins. previous studies have shown that clpb-cyt/hsp <dig> gene belongs to the group class i clp atpase proteins and clpb-cyt/hsp <dig> transcript is regulated by heat stress and developmental cues.


RESULTS
nine orfs were noted to constitute rice class i clp atpases in the following manner:  <dig> clpb proteins ,  <dig> clpc proteins  and  <dig> clpd proteins . using the respective signal sequences cloned upstream to gfp/cfp reporter proteins and transient expression studies with onion epidermal cells, evidence is provided that rice clpb-m and clp-c proteins are indeed localized to their respective cell locations mitochondria and chloroplasts, respectively. associated with their diverse cell locations, domain structures of osclpb-c, osclpb-m and osclpb-cyt proteins are noted to possess a high-level conservation. osclpb-cyt transcript is shown to be enriched at milk and dough stages of seed development. while expression of osclpb-m was significantly less as compared to its cytoplasmic and chloroplastic counterparts in different tissues, this transcript showed highest heat-induced expression amongst the  <dig> clpb proteins. osclpc <dig> and osclpc <dig> are predicted to be chloroplast-localized as is the case with all known plant clpc proteins. however, the fact that osclpc <dig> protein appears mitochondrial/chloroplastic with equal probability and osclpc <dig> a plasma membrane protein reflects functional diversity of this class. different class i clp atpase transcripts were noted to be cross-induced by a host of different abiotic stress conditions. complementation assays of Δhsp <dig> mutant yeast cells showed that osclpb-cyt, osclpb-m, osclpc <dig> and osclpd <dig> have significantly positive effects. remarkably, osclpd <dig> gene imparted appreciably high level tolerance to the mutant yeast cells.


CONCLUSIONS
rice class i clp atpase gene family is constituted of  <dig> members. of these  <dig>  only  <dig> belonging to clpb group are heat stress regulated. distribution of clpb proteins to different cell organelles indicates that their functioning might be critical in different cell locations. from the complementation assays, osclpd <dig> appears to be more effective than osclpb-cyt protein in rescuing the thermosensitive defect of the yeast scΔhsp <dig> mutant cells.
