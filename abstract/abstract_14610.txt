BACKGROUND
cytokine mediated induction of the mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule- <dig> expression is associated with the onset and progression of inflammatory bowel disease .


RESULTS
using western blotting and cell-based elisa, we show in this study that troglitazone, an activator of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ , widely used in the treatment of diabetes, has as well recently been highlighted as protective in models of inflammation and cancer. we found that troglitazone , significantly reduced the tnf-α  mediated induction of endothelial madcam- <dig> in a dose-dependent manner, achieving a  <dig> % to  <dig> % reduction in induced madcam- <dig>  trogliazone  reduced tnf-α induced vcam- <dig>  icam- <dig> and e-selectin expression. moreover, troglitazone significantly reduced α4β7-integrin dependent lymphocyte adhesion to tnf-α cultured endothelial cells.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that ppar-γ agonists like troglitazone may be useful in the clinical treatment of ibd.
