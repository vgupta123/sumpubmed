BACKGROUND
population-based bacterial genetics using repeated dna loci is an efficient approach to study the biodiversity and phylogeographical structure of human pathogens, such as mycobacterium tuberculosis, the agent of tuberculosis. indeed large genetic diversity databases are available for this pathogen and are regularly updated. no population-based polymorphism data were yet available for m. tuberculosis in turkey, at the crossroads of eurasia.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> dnas from mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from tuberculosis patients residing in turkey  were genotyped by spoligotyping, a high-throughput genotyping method based on the polymorphism of the direct repeat locus. thirty-three spoligotyping-defined clusters including  <dig> patients and  <dig> unique patterns were found. the st <dig> cluster, as designated according to the international spoldb <dig> database project, represented one fourth and when gathered to three genotypes, st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig>  one half of all the isolates. out of  <dig> clinical isolates harboring st <dig> which were further genotyped by is <dig> and by miru-vntr typing, a typical 2-copy is6110-rflp pattern and a "215125113322" miru-vntr pattern were observed among  <dig> clinical isolates. further search in various databases confirms the likely turkish-phylogeographical specificity of this clonal complex.


CONCLUSIONS
we described a new phylogeographically-specific clone of m. tuberculosis, designated lam7-tur. further investigations to assess its frequency within all regions of turkey and its phylogeographical origin and phylogenetic position within the global m. tuberculosis phylogenetic tree will shed new light on its endemicity in asia minor.
