BACKGROUND
the membrane anchored kinase, lmtk <dig>  is a serine/threonine kinase predominantly localized to endosomal compartments. lmtk <dig> has been shown to be involved in the trafficking of the cftr ion channel, the androgen receptor, as well as modulating neurodegeneration. as a membrane anchored protein, lmtk <dig> must be exported from the er, yet the mechanisms whereby lmtk <dig> is sequestered within the er for efficient export are unknown.

methods
sequence analysis of the carboxyl tail of lmtk <dig> revealed a putative di-acidic er export motif. site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to ablate this potential motif. subcellular fractionation, immunofluorescence microscopy, and transferrin recycling assays were used to determine the consequence of mutating lmtk2’s export motif.


RESULTS
mutation of the di-acidic export motif led to er retention of lmtk <dig>  and an increase in protein half-life and a concomitant loss of lmtk <dig> from its appropriate terminal destination. loss of lmtk <dig> from endosomal compartments by preventing its release from the er is linked to a reduction in transferrin recycling.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a di-acidic er export motif within the carboxyl tail of the membrane anchored kinase lmtk <dig>  this sequence is used by lmtk <dig> for its efficient export from the er.
