BACKGROUND
bmp <dig> mediated osteoblast differentiation plays a key role in skeletal development and bone disease. unfortunately, the signaling pathways regulated by bmp <dig> are largely uncharacterized due to both a lack of data and the complexity of the response.


RESULTS
to better characterize the signaling pathways responsive to bmp <dig>  we conducted a time series microarray study to track bmp <dig> induced osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. these temporal data were analyzed using a customized gene set analysis approach to identify temporally coherent sets of genes that act downstream of bmp <dig>  our analysis identified bmp <dig> regulation of previously reported pathways, such as the tgf-beta pathway. we also identified previously unknown connections between bmp <dig> and pathways such as notch signaling and the myb and baf <dig> regulatory modules. in addition, we identify a super-network of pathways that are sequentially activated following bmp <dig> induction.


CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we carried out a microarray-based temporal regulatory pathway analysis of bmp <dig> induced osteoblast differentiation and mineralization using gage method. this novel temporal analysis is more informative and powerful than the classical static pathway analysis in that:  it captures the interconnections between signaling pathways or functional modules and demonstrates the even higher level organization of molecular biological systems;  it describes the temporal perturbation patterns of each pathway or module and their dynamic roles in osteoblast differentiation. the same set of experimental and computational strategies employed in our work could be useful for studying other complex biological processes.
