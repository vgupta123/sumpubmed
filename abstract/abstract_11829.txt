BACKGROUND
molecular oxygen  is one of the key metabolites of all obligate and facultative aerobic pro- and eukaryotes. it plays a fundamental role in energy homeostasis whereas oxygen deprivation, in turn, broadly affects various physiological and pathophysiological processes. therefore, real-time monitoring of cellular oxygen levels is basically a prerequisite for the analysis of hypoxia-induced processes in living cells and tissues.


RESULTS
we developed a genetically encoded f√∂rster resonance energy transfer -based biosensor allowing the observation of changing molecular oxygen concentrations inside living cells. this biosensor named flubo  consists of the yellow fluorescent protein  that is sensitive towards oxygen depletion and the hypoxia-tolerant flavin-binding fluorescent protein . since o <dig> is essential for the formation of the yfp chromophore, efficient fret from the fbfp donor domain to the yfp acceptor domain only occurs in the presence but not in the absence of oxygen. the oxygen biosensor was used for continuous real-time monitoring of temporal changes of o <dig> levels in the cytoplasm of escherichia coli cells during batch cultivation.


CONCLUSIONS
flubo represents a unique fret-based oxygen biosensor which allows the non-invasive ratiometric readout of cellular oxygen. thus, flubo can serve as a novel and powerful probe for investigating the occurrence of hypoxia and its effects on a variety of physiological processes in living cells.
