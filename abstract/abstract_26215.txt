BACKGROUND
ranaviruses  are important pathogens of lower vertebrates. however, little is known about how they circumvent the immune response of their hosts. many ranaviruses contain a predicted protein, designated vif2α, which shows homology with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α. in analogy to distantly related proteins found in poxviruses vif2α might act as an inhibitor of the antiviral protein kinase pkr.


RESULTS
we have characterized the function of vif2α from rana catesbeiana virus z . multiple sequence alignments and secondary structure prediction revealed homology of vif2α with eif2α throughout the s1-, helical- and c-terminal domains. genetic and biochemical analyses showed that vif2α blocked the toxic effects of human and zebrafish pkr in a heterologous yeast system. rather than complementing eif2α function, vif2α acted in a manner comparable to the vaccinia virus  k3l protein , a pseudosubstrate inhibitor of pkr. both vif2α and k <dig> inhibited human pkr-mediated eif2α phosphorylation, but not pkr autophosphorylation on thr <dig>  in contrast the e3l protein , another poxvirus inhibitor of pkr, inhibited both thr <dig> and eif2α ser <dig> phosphorylation. interestingly, phosphorylation of eif2α by zebrafish pkr was inhibited by vif2α and e <dig>  but not by k <dig>  effective inhibition of pkr activity coincided with increased pkr expression levels, indicative of relieved autoinhibition of pkr expression. experiments with vif2α deletion constructs, showed that both the n-terminal and helical domains were sufficient for inhibition of pkr, whereas the c-terminal domain was dispensable.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that rcv-z vif2α is a functional inhibitor of human and zebrafish pkr, and probably functions in similar fashion as vacv k <dig>  this constitutes an important step in understanding the interaction of ranaviruses and the host innate immune system.
