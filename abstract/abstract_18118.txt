BACKGROUND
although the etiology of pd remains unclear, increasing evidence has shown that oxidative stress plays an important role in its pathogenesis and that of other neurodegenerative disorders. nox <dig>  a cytochrome subunit of nox, transports electrons across the plasma membrane to generate ros, leading to physiological and pathological processes. heme oxygenase- <dig>  can be rapidly induced by oxidative stress and other noxious stimuli in the brain or other tissues. astaxanthin , a carotenoid with antioxidant properties, is 100– <dig> times more effective than vitamin e. the present study investigated the neuroprotective effects of atx on mpp+-induced oxidative stress in pc <dig> cells.


RESULTS
mpp+ significantly decreased mtt levels in a concentration-dependent manner. hemin, snppix and atx didn’t exhibit any cytotoxic effects on pc <dig> cells. pretreatment with atx , caused intracellular ros production in the mpp+ group to decrease by  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. mpp+ increased nox <dig>  nrf <dig> and ho- <dig> protein expression compared with control . co-treatment with hemin or atx suppressed nox <dig> expression , and greatly increased nrf <dig> and ho- <dig> expression . mpp+ treatment up-regulated both nox <dig>  and ho- <dig>  mrna levels. co-treatment with hemin or atx significantly increased ho- <dig> mrna levels , and decreased nox <dig> mrna levels . mpp+ increased nox <dig> and ho- <dig> expression with considerable fluorescence extending out from the perinuclear region toward the periphery; this was attenuated by dpi. co-treatment with hemin or atx significantly up-regulated ho- <dig> expression and decreased nox <dig> expression with considerable fluorescence intensity .


CONCLUSIONS
atx suppresses mpp+-induced oxidative stress in pc <dig> cells via the ho-1/nox <dig> axis. atx should be strongly considered as a potential neuroprotectant and adjuvant therapy for patients with parkinson’s disease.
