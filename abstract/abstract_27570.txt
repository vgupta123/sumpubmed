BACKGROUND
17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from the fungus cochliobolus lunatus  is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase  superfamily. sdr proteins usually function as dimers or tetramers and 17β-hsdcl is also a homodimer under native conditions.


RESULTS
we have investigated here which secondary structure elements are involved in the dimerization of 17β-hsdcl and examined the importance of dimerization for the enzyme activity. sequence similarity with trihydroxynaphthalene reductase from magnaporthe grisea indicated that arg <dig> and his <dig> from the αe-helices interact with the asp <dig>  glu <dig> and asp <dig> residues from the αe and αf-helices of the neighbouring subunit. the arg129asp and his111leu mutations both rendered 17β-hsdcl monomeric, while the mutant 17β-hsdcl-his111ala was dimeric. circular dichroism spectroscopy analysis confirmed the conservation of the secondary structure in both monomers. the three mutant proteins all bound coenzyme, as shown by fluorescence quenching in the presence of nadp+, but both monomers showed no enzymatic activity.


CONCLUSIONS
we have shown by site-directed mutagenesis and structure/function analysis that 17β-hsdcl dimerization involves the αe and αf helices of both subunits. neighbouring subunits are connected through hydrophobic interactions, h-bonds and salt bridges involving amino acid residues his <dig> and arg <dig>  since the substitutions of these two amino acid residues lead to inactive monomers with conserved secondary structure, we suggest dimerization is a prerequisite for catalysis. a detailed understanding of this dimerization could lead to the development of compounds that will specifically prevent dimerization, thereby serving as a new type of inhibitor.
