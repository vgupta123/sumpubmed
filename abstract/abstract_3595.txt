BACKGROUND
mycobacterium tuberculosis  modulates host immune response, mainly t cell responses for its own survival leading to disease or latent infection. the molecules and mechanisms utilized to accomplish immune subversion by m. tuberculosis are not fully understood. understanding the molecular mechanism of t cell response to m. tuberculosis is important for development of efficacious vaccine against tb.

methods
here, we investigated effect of m. tuberculosis antigens ag85a and esat- <dig> on t cell signalling events in cd3/cd <dig> induced peripheral blood mononuclear cells  of ppd+ve healthy individuals and pulmonary tb patients. we studied cd <dig> induced intracellular calcium mobilization in pbmcs of healthy individuals and tb patients by spectrofluorimetry, cd <dig> and cd <dig> induced activation of mitogen activated protein kinases  in pbmcs of healthy individuals and tb patients by western blotting and binding of transcription factors nfat and nfκb by electrophorectic mobility shift assay .


RESULTS
we observed cd <dig> triggered modulations in free intracellular calcium concentrations in ppd+ve healthy individuals and pulmonary tb patients after the treatment of m. tuberculosis antigens. as regards the downstream signalling events, phosphorylation of mapks, extracellular signal-regulated kinase  <dig> and  <dig>  and p <dig> was curtailed by m. tuberculosis antigens in tb patients whereas, in ppd+ve healthy individuals only erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation was inhibited. besides, the terminal signalling events like binding of transcription factors nfat and nfκb was also altered by m. tuberculosis antigens. altogether, our results suggest that m. tuberculosis antigens, specifically esat- <dig>  interfere with tcr/cd28-induced upstream as well as downstream signalling events which might be responsible for defective il- <dig> production which further contributed in t-cell unresponsiveness, implicated in the progression of disease.


CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate effect of ag85a and esat- <dig> on tcr- and tcr/cd28- induced upstream and downstream signalling events of t-cell activation in tb patients. this study showed the effect of secretory antigens of m. tuberculosis in the modulation of t cell signalling pathways. this inflection is accomplished by altering the proximal and distal events of signalling cascade which could be involved in t-cell dysfunctioning during the progression of the disease.
