BACKGROUND
bidirectional promoters are common in genomes but under-studied experimentally, particularly in plants. we describe a targeted identification and selection of a subset of putative bidirectional promoters to identify genes involved in seed development and to investigate possible coordinated responses of gene pairs to conditions important in seed maturation such as desiccation and aba-regulation.


RESULTS
we combined a search for 100–600 bp intergenic regions in the arabidopsis genome with a cis-element based selection for those containing multiple copies of the g-box motif, cacgtg. one of the putative bidirectional promoters identified also contained a ce <dig> coupling element 5 bp downstream of one g-box and is identical to that characterized previously in the hva <dig> promoter of barley. ce <dig> elements are significantly under-represented and under-studied in arabidopsis. we further characterized the pair of genes associated with this promoter and uncovered roles for two small, previously uncharacterized, plant-specific proteins in arabidopsis seed development and stress responses.


CONCLUSIONS
using bioinformatics we identified putative bidirectional promoters involved in seed development and analysed expression patterns for a pair of plant-specific genes in various tissues and in response to hormones/stress. we also present preliminary functional analysis of these genes that is suggestive of roles in seed development.
