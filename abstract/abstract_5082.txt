BACKGROUND
we tested the hypothesis that elevated homocysteine  level is causally associated with increased risk of type  <dig> diabetes mellitus .


RESULTS
the meta-analysis and mendelian randomization analysis were performed among  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls. the absolute pooled mean hcy concentration in subjects with mthfr 677tt was  <dig>  μmol/l  greater than that in subjects with mthfr 677cc in t2dm. overall, the t allele of the mthfr  <dig> c > t conferred a greater risk for t2dm . the random effect  pooled or associated with t2dm for mthfr 677tt relative to the 677cc was . the fixed-effect pooled or of the association for the mthfr  <dig> tt vs ct was  <dig>  . mthfr  <dig> tt showed a significantly higher risk for t2dm compared with mthfr  <dig> cc + ct . the absolute pooled mean hcy concentration in individuals with t2dm was  <dig>  μmol/l  greater than that in control subjects. the estimated causal or associated with t2dm was  <dig>  for 5 μmol/l increment in hcy.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings provided strong evidence on the causal association of hcy level with the development of t2dm.
