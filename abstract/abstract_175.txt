BACKGROUND
the homeodomain transcription factor ipf1/pdx <dig> exerts a dual role in the pancreas; ipf1/pdx <dig> global null mutants fail to develop a pancreas whereas conditional inactivation of ipf1/pdx <dig> in β-cells leads to impaired β-cell function and diabetes. although several putative target genes have been linked to the β-cell function of ipf1/pdx <dig>  relatively little is known with respect to genes regulated by ipf1/pdx <dig> in early pancreatic progenitor cells.


RESULTS
microarray analyses identified a total of  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed in e <dig>  pancreatic buds of ipf1/pdx1-/- embryos. the expression of one of these, spondin  <dig>  which encodes an extracellular matrix protein, has not previously been described in the pancreas. quantitative real-time rt-pcr analyses and immunohistochemical analyses also revealed that the expression of fgfr2iiib, that encodes the receptor for fgf <dig>  was down-regulated in ipf1/pdx1-/- pancreatic progenitor cells.


CONCLUSIONS
this microarray analysis has identified a number of candidate genes that are differentially expressed in ipf1/pdx1-/- pancreatic buds. several of the differentially expressed genes were known to be important for pancreatic progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation whereas others have not previously been associated with pancreatic development.
