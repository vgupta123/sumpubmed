BACKGROUND
it has long been recognized that sensitivity analysis plays a key role in modeling and analyzing cellular and biochemical processes. systems biology markup language  has become a well-known platform for coding and sharing mathematical models of such processes. however, current sbml compatible software tools are limited in their ability to perform global sensitivity analyses of these models.


RESULTS
this work introduces a freely downloadable, software package, sbml-sat, which implements algorithms for simulation, steady state analysis, robustness analysis and local and global sensitivity analysis for sbml models. this software tool extends current capabilities through its execution of global sensitivity analyses using multi-parametric sensitivity analysis, partial rank correlation coefficient, sobol's method, and weighted average of local sensitivity analyses in addition to its ability to handle systems with discontinuous events and intuitive graphical user interface.


CONCLUSIONS
sbml-sat provides the community of systems biologists a new tool for the analysis of their sbml models of biochemical and cellular processes.
