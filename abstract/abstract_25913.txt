BACKGROUND
dynamic monitoring of protein expression and localization is fundamental to the understanding of biological processes. the paired-class homeodomain-containing transcription factor otx <dig> is essential for normal head and brain development in vertebrates. recent conditional knockout studies have pointed to multiple roles of this protein during late development and post-natal life. yet, later expression and functions remain poorly characterized as specific reagents to detect the protein at any stage of development are still missing.


RESULTS
we generated a new mouse line harbouring an insertion of the gfp gene within the otx <dig> coding sequence to monitor the gene activity while preserving most of its functions. our results demonstrate that this line represents a convenient tool to capture the dynamics of otx <dig> gene expression from early embryonic stages to adulthood. in addition, we could visualize the intracellular location of otx <dig> protein. in the retina, we reinterpret the former view of protein distribution and show a further level of regulation of intranuclear protein localization, which depends on the cell type.


CONCLUSIONS
the gfp-tagged otx <dig> mouse line fully recapitulates previously known expression patterns and brings additional accuracy and easiness of detection of otx <dig> gene activity. this opens up the way to live imaging of a highly dynamic actor of brain development and can be adapted to any mutant background to probe for genetic interaction between otx <dig> and the mutated gene.
