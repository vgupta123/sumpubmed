BACKGROUND
arabidopsis zbf1/myc2bhlh transcription factor is a repressor of photomorphogenesis, and acts as a point of cross talk in light, abscisic acid  and jasmonic acid  signaling pathways. myc <dig> also functions as a positive regulator of lateral root development and flowering time under long day conditions. however, the function of myc <dig> in growth and development remains unknown in crop plants.


RESULTS
here, we report the functional analyses of lemyc <dig> in tomato . the amino acid sequence of lemyc <dig> showed extensive homology with arabidopsis myc <dig>  containing the conserved bhlh domain. to study the function of lemyc <dig> in tomato, overexpression and rna interference  lemyc <dig> tomato transgenic plants were generated. examination of seedling morphology, physiological responses and light regulated gene expression has revealed that lemyc <dig> works as a negative regulator of blue light mediated photomorphogenesis. furthermore, lemyc <dig> specifically binds to the g-box of lerbcs-3a promoter. overexpression of lemyc <dig> has led to increased root length with more number of lateral roots. the tomato plants overexpressing lemyc <dig> have reduced internode distance with more branches, and display the opposite morphology to rnai transgenic lines. furthermore, this study shows that lemyc <dig> promotes aba and ja responsiveness.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, this study highlights that working in light, aba and ja signaling pathways lemyc <dig> works as an important regulator for growth and development in tomato plants.
