BACKGROUND
neural stem cells offer potential treatment for neurodegenerative disorders, such like alzheimer's disease . while much progress has been made in understanding neural stem cell function, a precise description of the molecular mechanisms regulating neural stem cells is not yet established. this lack of knowledge is a major barrier holding back the discovery of therapeutic uses of neural stem cells. in this paper, the regulatory mechanism of mouse neural stem cell  differentiation by tmem <dig> is explored on the genome-level.


RESULTS
we identified regulators of tmem <dig> during the differentiation of mouse nscs from a compendium of expression profiles. based on the microarray experiment, we developed the parallelized swni algorithm to reconstruct gene regulatory networks of mouse neural stem cells. from the inferred tmem <dig> related gene network including  <dig> genes, pou6f <dig> was identified to regulate tmem <dig> significantly and might play an important role in the differentiation of nscs in mouse brain. there are four pathways shown in the gene network, indicating that tmem <dig> locates in the downstream of the signalling pathway. the real-time rt-pcr results shown that the over-expression of pou6f <dig> could significantly up-regulate tmem <dig> expression in c <dig>  nsc line.  <dig> out of  <dig> predicted genes in our constructed network have been reported to be ad-related, including ace, aqp <dig>  arrdc <dig>  cd <dig>  cd59a, cds <dig>  cldn <dig>  cox8b, defb <dig>  folr <dig>  gdi <dig>  mmp <dig>  mgp, myrip, ripk <dig>  rnd <dig>  and sncg. the localization of tmem <dig> related genes and functional-related gene groups based on the gene ontology  annotation was also identified.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that the expression of tmem <dig> is an important factor contributing to ad. the parallelized swni algorithm increased the efficiency of network reconstruction significantly. this study enables us to highlight novel genes that may be involved in nsc differentiation and provides a shortcut to identifying genes for ad.
