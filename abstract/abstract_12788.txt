BACKGROUND
identification of protein-protein interactions is a fundamental aspect of understanding protein function. a commonly used method for identifying protein interactions is the yeast two-hybrid system.


RESULTS
here we describe the application of next-generation sequencing to yeast two-hybrid interaction screens and develop quantitative interactor screen sequencing . qis-seq provides a quantitative measurement of enrichment for each interactor relative to its frequency in the library as well as its general stickiness . the qis-seq approach is scalable and can be used with any yeast two-hybrid screen and with any next-generation sequencing platform. the quantitative nature of qis-seq data make it amenable to statistical evaluation, and importantly, facilitates the standardization of experimental design, data collection, and data analysis. we applied qis-seq to identify the arabidopsis thaliana mlo <dig> protein as a target of the pseudomonas syringae type iii secreted effector protein hopz <dig>  we validate the interaction between hopz <dig> and mlo <dig> in planta and show that the interaction is required for hopz2-associated virulence.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that qis-seq is a high-throughput quantitative interactor screen and validate mlo <dig> as an interactor and novel virulence target of the p. syringae type iii secreted effector hopz <dig>
