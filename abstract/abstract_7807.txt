BACKGROUND
mycobacterium tuberculosis  infections are still a major cause of death among all infectious diseases. although 99% of individuals infected with mtb develop a cd4+ th <dig> and cd8+ t cell mediated immunity as measured by tuberculin skin test, this results only in partial protection and mtb vaccines are not effective. deviation of immune responses by pathogens towards a th <dig> profile is a common mechanism of immune evasion, typically leading to the persistence of the microbes.


RESULTS
here we tested the stimulatory capacity of selective mtb antigens on human monocyte-derived dendritic cell  maturation and cytokine production. dc maturation markers cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> were readily upregulated by h37ra- and h37rv-associated antigens, the 30-kda  and 38-kda mtb antigens only partially induced these markers. all mtb antigens induced variable levels of il- <dig> and low levels of il- <dig>  there was no release of il-12p <dig> detectable. substantial il-12p <dig> production was restricted to lps or h37ra and h37rv preparations. although the proliferation levels of primary t cell responses were comparable using all the differentially stimulated dc, the 30-kda and 38-kda antigens showed a bias towards il- <dig> secretion of polarized cd4+ t cells after secondary stimulation as compared to h37ra and h37rv preparations.


CONCLUSIONS
together our data indicate that 30-kda and 38-kda mtb antigens induced only partial dc maturation shifting immune responses towards a th <dig> profile.
