BACKGROUND
earlier we have shown that the mobile phone radiation  alters protein expression in human endothelial cell line. this does not mean that similar response will take place in human body exposed to this radiation. therefore, in this pilot human volunteer study, using proteomics approach, we have examined whether a local exposure of human skin to rf-emf will cause changes in protein expression in living people.


RESULTS
small area of forearm's skin in  <dig> female volunteers was exposed to rf-emf  and punch biopsies were collected from exposed and non-exposed areas of skin. proteins extracted from biopsies were separated using 2-de and protein expression changes were analyzed using pdquest software. analysis has identified  <dig> proteins that were statistically significantly affected . two of the proteins were present in all  <dig> volunteers. this suggests that protein expression in human skin might be affected by the exposure to rf-emf. the number of affected proteins was similar to the number of affected proteins observed in our earlier in vitro studies.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study showing that molecular level changes might take place in human volunteers in response to exposure to rf-emf. our study confirms that proteomics screening approach can identify protein targets of rf-emf in human volunteers.
