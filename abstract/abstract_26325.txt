BACKGROUND
squamosa promoter binding protein -box family genes encode plant-specific transcription factors that control many important biological functions, including phase transition, inflorescence branching, fruit ripening, and copper homeostasis. nevertheless, the evolutionary patterns of sbp-box genes and evolutionary forces driving them are still not well understood.

methods
 <dig> sbp-box gene candidates of five representative land plants were obtained from phytozome database . phylogenetic combined with gene structure analyses were used to identify sbp-box gene lineages in land plants. gene copy number and the sequence and structure features were then compared among these different sbp-box lineages. selection analysis, relative rate tests and expression divergence were finally used to interpret the evolutionary relationships and divergence of sbp-box genes in land plants.


RESULTS
we investigated  <dig> sbp-box genes from moss, arabidopsis, poplar, rice, and maize. these genes are divided into group i and ii, and the latter is further divided into two subgroups  based on phylogenetic analysis. interestingly, subgroup ii- <dig> genes have similar sequence and structural features to group i genes, whereas subgroup ii- <dig> genes exhibit intrinsic differences on these features, including high copy numbers and the presence of mir156/mir <dig> regulation. further analyses indicate that subgroup ii- <dig> genes are constrained by stronger purifying selection and evolve at a lower substitution rate than ii- <dig> genes, just as group i genes do when compared to ii genes. among subgroup ii- <dig> genes, mir <dig> targets evolve more rapidly than mir <dig> targets and experience comparatively relaxed purifying selection. these results suggest that group i and subgroup ii- <dig> genes under strong selective constraint are conserved. by contrast, subgroup ii- <dig> genes evolve under relaxed purifying selection and have diversified through gene copy duplications and changes in mir156/ <dig> regulation, which might contribute to morphological diversifications of land plants.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that different evolutionary rates and selection strengths lead to differing evolutionary patterns in sbp-box genes in land plants, providing a guide for future functional diversity analyses of these genes.
