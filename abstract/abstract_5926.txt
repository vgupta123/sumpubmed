BACKGROUND
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  utilizing the high-resolution power of an orbitrap is an important analytical technique for both metabolomics and proteomics. most important feature of the orbitrap is excellent mass accuracy. thus, it is necessary to convert raw data to accurate and reliable m/z values for metabolic fingerprinting by high-resolution lc-ms.


RESULTS
in the present study, we developed a novel, easy-to-use and straightforward m/z detection method, amdorap. for assessing the performance, we used real biological samples, bacillus subtilis strains  <dig> and mgb <dig>  in the positive mode by lc-orbitrap. for  <dig> identified compounds by measuring the authentic compounds, we compared obtained m/z values with other lc-ms processing tools. the errors by amdorap were distributed within Â± <dig> ppm and showed the best performance in m/z value accuracy.


CONCLUSIONS
our method can detect m/z values of biological samples much more accurately than other lc-ms analysis tools. amdorap allows us to address the relationships between biological effects and cellular metabolites based on accurate m/z values. obtaining the accurate m/z values from raw data should be indispensable as a starting point for comparative lc-orbitrap analysis. amdorap is freely available under an open-source license at http://amdorap.sourceforge.net/.
