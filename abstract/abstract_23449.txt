BACKGROUND
next-generation sequencing technologies allow researchers to obtain millions of sequence reads in a single experiment. one important use of the technology is the sequencing of small non-coding regulatory rnas and the identification of the genomic locales from which they originate. currently, there is a paucity of methods for finding small rna generative locales.


RESULTS
we describe and implement an algorithm that can determine small rna generative locales from high-throughput sequencing data. the algorithm creates a network, or graph, of the small rnas by creating links between them depending on their proximity on the target genome. for each of the sub-networks in the resulting graph the clustering coefficient, a measure of the interconnectedness of the subnetwork, is used to identify the generative locales. we test the algorithm over a wide range of parameters using rfam sequences as positive controls and demonstrate that the algorithm has good sensitivity and specificity in a range of arabidopsis and mouse small rna sequence sets and that the locales it generates are robust to differences in the choice of parameters.


CONCLUSIONS
nibls is a fast, reliable and sensitive method for determining small rna locales in high-throughput sequence data that is generally applicable to all classes of small rna.
