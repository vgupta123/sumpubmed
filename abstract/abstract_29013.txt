BACKGROUND
the large amounts of data generated by genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics have increased our understanding of the biology of anaplasma marginale. however, these data have also led to new assumptions that require testing, ideally through classical genetic mutation. one example is the definition of genes associated with virulence. here we describe the molecular characterization of a red fluorescent and spectinomycin and streptomycin resistant a. marginale mutant generated by himar <dig> transposon mutagenesis.


RESULTS
high throughput genome sequencing to determine the himar1-a. marginale genome junctions established that the transposon sequences were integrated within the coding region of the omp <dig> gene. this gene is arranged within an operon with am <dig> at the 5’ end and with omp <dig>  omp <dig>  omp <dig> and omp <dig> arranged in tandem at the 3’ end. rna analysis to determine the effects of the transposon insertion on the expression of omp <dig> and downstream genes revealed that the himar <dig> insertion not only reduced the expression of omp <dig> but also that of downstream genes. transcript expression from omp <dig>  and omp <dig> dropped by more than 90% in comparison with their counterparts in wild-type a. marginale. immunoblot analysis showed a reduction in the production of omp <dig> protein in these mutants compared to wild-type a. marginale.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate that transposon mutagenesis in a. marginale is possible and that this technology can be used for the creation of insertional gene knockouts that can be evaluated in natural host-vector systems.
