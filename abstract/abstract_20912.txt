BACKGROUND
nonhost resistance  provides immunity to all members of a plant species against all isolates of a microorganism that is pathogenic to other plant species. three arabidopsis thaliana pen  genes, pen <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have been shown to provide nhr against the barley pathogen blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei at the prehaustorial level. arabidopsis pen1- <dig> mutant lacking the pen <dig> gene is penetrated by the hemibiotrophic oomycete pathogen phytophthora sojae, the causal organism of the root and stem rot disease in soybean. we investigated if there is any novel nonhost resistance mechanism in arabidopsis against the soybean pathogen, p. sojae.


RESULTS
the p.sojaesusceptible   <dig> mutant was identified by screening a mutant population created in the arabidopsis pen1- <dig> mutant that lacks penetration resistance against the non adapted barley biotrophic fungal pathogen, blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei. segregation data suggested that pen <dig> is not epistatic to pss <dig>  responses of pss <dig> and pen1- <dig> to p. sojae invasion were distinct and suggest that pss <dig> may act at both pre- and post-haustorial levels, while pen <dig> acts at the pre-haustorial level against this soybean pathogen. therefore, pss <dig> encodes a new form of nonhost resistance. the pss <dig> mutant is also infected by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen, fusarium virguliforme, which causes sudden death syndrome in soybean. thus, a common nhr mechanism is operative in arabidopsis against both hemibiotrophic oomycetes and necrotrophic fungal pathogens that are pathogenic to soybean. however, pss <dig> does not play any role in immunity against the bacterial pathogen, pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea, that causes bacterial blight in soybean. we mapped pss <dig> to a region very close to the southern telomere of chromosome  <dig> that carries no known disease resistance genes.


CONCLUSIONS
the study revealed that arabidopsis pss <dig> is a novel nonhost resistance gene that confers a new form of nonhost resistance against both a hemibiotrophic oomycete pathogen, p. sojae and a necrotrophic fungal pathogen, f. virguliforme that cause diseases in soybean. however, this gene does not play any role in the immunity of arabidopsis to the bacterial pathogen, p. syringae pv. glycinea, which causes bacterial blight in soybean. identification and further characterization of the pss <dig> gene would provide further insights into a new form of nonhost resistance in arabidopsis, which could be utilized in improving resistance of soybean to two serious pathogens.
