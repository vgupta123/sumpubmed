BACKGROUND
the tumor suppressor p <dig> plays pivotal roles in tumorigenesis suppression. although oscillations of p <dig> have been extensively studied, the mechanism of p <dig> pulses and their physiological roles in dna damage response remain unclear.


RESULTS
to address these questions we presented an integrated model in which ataxia-telangiectasia mutated  activation and p <dig> oscillation were incorporated with downstream apoptotic events, particularly the interplays between bcl- <dig> family proteins. we first reproduced digital oscillation of p <dig> as the response of normal cells to dna damage. subsequent modeling in mutant cells showed that high basal dna damage is a plausible cause for sustained p <dig> pulses observed in tumor cells. further computational analyses indicated that p53-dependent puma accumulation and the puma-controlled bax activation switch might play pivotal roles to count p <dig> pulses and thus decide the cell fate.


CONCLUSIONS
the high levels of basal dna damage are responsible for generating sustained pulses of p <dig> in the tumor cells. meanwhile, the bax activation switch can count p <dig> pulses through puma accumulation and transfer it into death signal. our modeling provides a plausible mechanism about how cells generate and orchestrate p <dig> pulses to tip the balance between survival and death.
