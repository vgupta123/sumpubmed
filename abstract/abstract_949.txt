BACKGROUND
candida albicans water-soluble fraction , a mannoprotein-β-glucan complex obtained from the culture supernatant of c. albicans nbrc <dig>  causes caws-mediated vasculitis  in b <dig> and dba/ <dig> mice with mild and lethal symptoms, respectively. why caws is lethal only in dba/ <dig> mice remains unknown.


RESULTS
we performed dna microarray analyses using mrna obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells  of b <dig> and dba/ <dig> mice and compared their respective transcriptomes. we found that the mrna levels of interferon-γ  and several genes that regulate the complement system, such as c <dig>  c <dig>  cfb, cfh, and fcna, were increased dramatically only in dba/ <dig> mice at  <dig> and  <dig> weeks after caws administration. the dramatic increase was confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions . moreover, mrna levels of immune-related genes, such as irf <dig>  irf <dig>  irf <dig>  cebpb, ccl <dig>  itgam, icam <dig>  and il-12rb <dig>  whose expression levels are known to be increased by ifng, were also increased, but only in dba/ <dig> mice. by contrast, the mrna level of dectin- <dig>  the critical receptor for the α-mannans of caws, was increased slightly and similarly in both b <dig> and dba/ <dig> mice after caws administration.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our results suggest that caws administration induces dectin- <dig> mediated caws-vasculitis in both b <dig> and dba/ <dig> mice and the expression of ifng, but only in dba/ <dig> mice, which led to increased expression of c <dig>  c <dig>  cfb, cfh, and fcna and an associated increase in lethality in these mice. this model may contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of severe human vasculitis.
