BACKGROUND
the unfolded protein response  controls the protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum . central to this signaling pathway is the er-resident bifunctional transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease ire <dig>  the endoribonuclease  domain of ire <dig> initiates a non-conventional mrna splicing reaction, leading to the production of a transcription factor that controls upr target genes. the mrna splicing reaction is an obligatory step of ire <dig> signaling, yet its mechanism has remained poorly understood due to the absence of substrate-bound crystal structures of ire <dig>  the lack of structural similarity between ire <dig> and other rnases, and a scarcity of quantitative enzymological data. here, we experimentally define the active site of ire <dig> rnase and quantitatively evaluate the contribution of the key active site residues to catalysis.


RESULTS
this analysis and two new crystal structures suggest that ire <dig> rnase uses histidine h <dig> and tyrosine y <dig> as the general acid-general base pair contributing â‰¥  <dig>  kcal/mol and  <dig>  kcal/mol to transition state stabilization, respectively, and asparagine n <dig> and arginine r <dig> for coordination of the scissile phosphate. investigation of the stem-loop recognition revealed that additionally to the stem-loops derived from the classic ire <dig> substrates hac <dig> and xbp <dig> mrna, ire <dig> can site-specifically and rapidly cleave anticodon stem-loop  of unmodified trnaphe, extending known substrate specificity of ire <dig> rnase.


CONCLUSIONS
our data define the catalytic center of ire <dig> rnase and suggest a mechanism of rna cleavage: each rnase monomer apparently contains a separate catalytic apparatus for rna cleavage, whereas two rnase subunits contribute to rna stem-loop docking. conservation of the key residues among ire <dig> homologues suggests that the mechanism elucidated here for yeast ire <dig> applies to ire <dig> in metazoan cells, and to the only known ire <dig> homologue rnase l.
