BACKGROUND
in the retina, many of the genes that encode components of the visual transduction cascade and retinoid recycling are exclusively expressed in photoreceptor cells and show highly stereotyped temporal and spatial expression patterns. multiple transcriptional activators of photoreceptor-specific genes have been identified, but little is known about negative regulation of gene expression in the retina. we recently identified klf <dig>  a member of the sp/kr√ºppel-like factor family of zinc-finger containing transcription factors, as an in vitro repressor of the promoters of the photoreceptor-specific genes rhodopsin and irbp/rbp <dig>  to gain further insight into the mechanism of klf15-mediated regulation of gene expression, we have characterized the binding characteristics and specificity of klf15's dna binding domains and defined the klf <dig> binding sites in the rhodopsin and irbp promoters.


RESULTS
in emsa and dnasei footprinting assays, a klf15-gst fusion protein containing the c-terminal zinc-finger domains  showed zinc-dependent and sequence-specific binding to a  <dig> bp consensus sequence containing a core cg/tcccc. both the bovine rhodopsin and irbp promoters contained multiple klf <dig> binding sites that included the previously identified crs- <dig> and g-rich repressor elements. klf <dig> binding sites were highly conserved between the bovine, human, chimp and dog rhodopsin promoters, but less conserved in rodents. klf <dig> reduced luciferase expression by brho130-luc  and repressed promoter activation by crx  and/or nrl , although the magnitude of the reduction was smaller than previously reported for a longer brho225-luc .


CONCLUSIONS
klf <dig> binds to multiple  <dig> bp consensus sites in the rhodospin and irbp promoters including the crs- <dig> and g-rich repressor elements. based on the known expression pattern of klf <dig> in non-photoreceptor cells, we hypothesize an in vivo role for klf <dig> in repressing photoreceptor-specific gene expression in the inner retina.
