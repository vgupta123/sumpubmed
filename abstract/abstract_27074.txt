BACKGROUND
the c-terminal eps <dig> homology domain-containing protein  <dig>  is ubiquitously expressed and regulates the endocytic trafficking and recycling of membrane components and several transmembrane receptors. to elucidate the function of ehd <dig> in mammalian development, we generated ehd1-/- mice using a cre/loxp system.


RESULTS
both male and female ehd1-/- mice survived at sub-mendelian ratios. a proportion of ehd1-/- mice were viable and showed smaller size at birth, which continued into adulthood. ehd1-/- adult males were infertile and displayed decreased testis size, whereas ehd1-/- females were fertile. in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry of developing wildtype mouse testes revealed ehd <dig> expression in most cells of the seminiferous epithelia. histopathology revealed abnormal spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules and the absence of mature spermatozoa in the epididymides of ehd1-/- males. seminiferous tubules showed disruption of the normal spermatogenic cycle with abnormal acrosomal development on round spermatids, clumping of acrosomes, misaligned spermatids and the absence of normal elongated spermatids in ehd1-/- males. light and electron microscopy analyses indicated that elongated spermatids were abnormally phagocytosed by sertoli cells in ehd1-/- mice.


CONCLUSIONS
contrary to a previous report, these results demonstrate an important role for ehd <dig> in pre- and post-natal development with a specific role in spermatogenesis.
