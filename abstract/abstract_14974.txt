BACKGROUND
the infrarenal abdominal aorta exhibits increased disease susceptibility relative to other aortic regions. allograft studies exchanging thoracic and abdominal segments showed that regional susceptibility is maintained regardless of location, suggesting substantial roles for embryological origin, tissue composition and site-specific gene expression.


RESULTS
we analyzed gene expression with microarrays in baboon aortas, and found that members of the hox gene family exhibited spatial expression differences. hoxa <dig> was chosen for further study, since it had decreased expression in the abdominal compared to the thoracic aorta. western blot analysis from  <dig> human aortas demonstrated significantly higher hoxa <dig> protein levels in thoracic compared to abdominal tissues . immunohistochemical staining for hoxa <dig> showed nuclear and perinuclear staining in endothelial and smooth muscle cells in aorta. the hoxa <dig> transcript levels were significantly decreased in human abdominal aortic aneurysms  compared to age-matched non-aneurysmal controls . cultured human aortic endothelial and smooth muscle cells stimulated with inf-Î³  showed decreased levels of hoxa <dig> protein .


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrated spatial variation in expression of hoxa <dig> in human aortas that persisted into adulthood and that downregulation of hoxa <dig> expression was associated with aaas, an important aortic disease of the ageing population.
