BACKGROUND
gene targeting is a powerful method that can be used for examining the functions of genes. traditionally, the construction of knockout  vectors requires an amplification step to obtain two homologous, large fragments of genomic dna. restriction enzymes that cut at unique recognitions sites and numerous cloning steps are then carried out; this is often a time-consuming and frustrating process.


RESULTS
we have developed a one-step cloning method for the insertion of two arms into a ko vector using exonuclease iii. we modified an adeno-associated virus ko shuttle vector  to yield paav-lic, which contained two cassettes at the two multiple-cloning sites. the vector was digested with ecorv to give two fragments. the two homologous arms, which had an overlap of  <dig> bases with the ends of the vector fragments, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. after purification, the four fragments were mixed and treated with exonuclease iii, then transformed into escherichia coli to obtain the desired clones. using this method, we constructed sirt <dig> and hdac <dig> ko vectors, which were used to establish sirt <dig> ko cells from the colorectal cancer cell line  and hdac <dig> ko cells from the colorectal cancer cell line .


CONCLUSIONS
our method is a fast, simple, and efficient technique for cloning, and has great potential for high-throughput construction of ko vectors.
