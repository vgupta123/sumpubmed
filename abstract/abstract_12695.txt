BACKGROUND
cerebral ischemia is usually characterized by a reduction in local blood flow and metabolism and by disruption of the blood-brain barrier in the infarct region. the formation of oedema and opening of the blood-brain barrier in stroke is associated with enhanced expression of metalloproteinase- <dig>  and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- <dig> .


RESULTS
here, we found an infarct volume of  <dig>  Â± 2% and a reduced neurological function after two hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion , followed by  <dig> hours of recirculation in rat. immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy revealed enhanced expression of mmp- <dig>  timp- <dig>  and phosphorylated erk1/ <dig> in the smooth muscle cells of the ischemic mca and associated intracerebral microvessels. the specific mek1/ <dig> inhibitor u <dig>  given intraperitoneal zero or  <dig> hours after the ischemic event, reduced the infarct volume significantly , improved neurological function, normalized expression of phosphorylated erk1/ <dig>  and reduced expression of mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig> in the vessel walls. administration of u <dig>  <dig> hours after mcao did not alter the expression of mmp- <dig>  immunocytochemistry showed no overlap in expression between mmp-9/timp- <dig> and the astrocyte/glial cell marker gfap in the vessel walls.


CONCLUSIONS
these data are the first to show that the elevated vascular expression of mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig>  associated with breakdown of the blood-brain barrier following focal ischemia, are transcriptionally regulated via the mek/erk pathway.
