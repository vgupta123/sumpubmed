BACKGROUND
the lysosomal  <dig>  kda protein from mouse is a soluble, mannose 6-phosphate containing protein of so far unknown function. it is synthesized as a glycosylated  <dig> kda precursor that undergoes limited proteolysis leading to a  <dig> kda n- and a  <dig> kda c-terminal fragment.


RESULTS
in order to gain insight into the function and the post-translational maturation process of the glycosylated  <dig>  kda protein, three crystal structures were determined that represent different maturation states. these structures demonstrate that the  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda fragment which have been derived by a proteolytic cleavage remain associated. mass spectrometric analysis confirmed the subsequent trimming of the c-terminus of the  <dig> kda fragment making a large pocket accessible, at the bottom of which the putative active site is located. the crystal structures reveal a significant similarity of the  <dig>  kda protein to several bacterial hydrolases. the core αββα sandwich fold and a cysteine residue at the n-terminus of the  <dig> kda fragment  classify the  <dig>  kda protein as a member of the structurally defined n-terminal nucleophile  hydrolase superfamily.


CONCLUSIONS
due to the close resemblance of the  <dig>  kda protein to members of the ntn hydrolase superfamily a hydrolytic activity on substrates containing a non-peptide amide bond seems reasonable. the structural homology which comprises both the overall fold and essential active site residues also implies an autocatalytic maturation process of the lysosomal  <dig>  kda protein. upon the proteolytic cleavage between s <dig> and c <dig>  a deep pocket becomes solvent accessible, which harbors the putative active site of the  <dig>  kda protein.
