BACKGROUND
clostridium  perfringens is the causative agent of several diseases in animals and humans, including histotoxic and enteric infections. to gain more insight into the occurrence of its different toxin-genotypes in dairy herds, including those toxin genes previously associated with diseases in cattle or humans,  <dig> isolates cultivated from feces, rumen content and feed collected from  <dig> dairy farms were characterized by pcr .


RESULTS
isolates from feces were assigned to type a  and d . those from rumen content  and feed  were all assigned to type a. the consensus and atypical variants of the cpb <dig> gene were detected in  <dig>  and  <dig>  of all isolates from feces, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  of all isolates from rumen content, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
both allelic variants of cpb <dig> occurred frequently in animals without signs of acute enteric disease, whereby the atypical variant dominated. five  of all type a isolates were positive for the cpe gene. therefore, the present study indicates that dairy cows are no primary source for potentially human pathogenic enterotoxin gene positive strains.
