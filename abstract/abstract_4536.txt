BACKGROUND
genome-wide disease-gene finding approaches may sometimes provide us with a long list of candidate genes. since using pure experimental approaches to verify all candidates could be expensive, a number of network-based methods have been developed to prioritize candidates. such tools usually have a set of parameters pre-trained using available network data. this means that re-training network-based tools may be required when existing biological networks are updated or when networks from different sources are to be tried.


RESULTS
we developed a parameter-free method, interconnectedness , to rank candidate genes by assessing the closeness of them to known disease genes in a network. icn was tested using  <dig>  known disease-gene associations and achieved a success rate of ~44% using a protein-protein interaction network under a test scenario of simulated linkage analysis. this performance is comparable with those of other well-known methods and icn outperforms other methods when a candidate disease gene is not directly linked to known disease genes in a network. interestingly, we show that a combined scoring strategy could enable icn to achieve an even better performance  than other methods used alone.


CONCLUSIONS
icn, a user-friendly method, can well complement other network-based methods in the context of prioritizing candidate disease genes.
