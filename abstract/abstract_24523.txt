BACKGROUND
in both beef and dairy cattle, the majority of early embryo loss occurs within the first 14 days following insemination. during this time-period, embryos are completely dependent on their maternal uterine environment for development, growth and ultimately survival, therefore an optimum uterine environment is critical to their survival. the objective of this study was to investigate whether differences in endometrial gene expression during the mid-luteal phase of the estrous cycle exist between crossbred beef heifers ranked as either high  or low fertility  ) using the affymetrix® 23 k bovine gene chip.


RESULTS
conception rates for each of the four rounds of ai were within a normal range: 70– <dig> %. microarray analysis of endometrial tissue collected on day  <dig> of the estrous cycle detected  <dig> differentially expressed genes  between hf  and lf  animals. the main gene pathways affected were, cellular growth and proliferation, angiogenesis, lipid metabolism, cellular and tissue morphology and development, inflammation and metabolic exchange. deg included, fst, slc45a <dig>  mmp <dig>  fads <dig> and galnt <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this study highlights, some of the molecular mechanisms potentially controlling uterine endometrial function during the mid-luteal phase of the estrous cycle, which may contribute to uterine endometrial mediated impaired fertility in cattle. differentially expressed genes are potential candidate genes for the identification of genetic variation influencing cow fertility, which may be incorporated into future breeding programmes.
