BACKGROUND
ultraconserved elements are nucleotide or protein sequences with 100% identity  in the same organism or between two or more organisms. studies indicate that these conserved regions are associated with micro rnas, mrna processing, development and transcription regulation. the identification and characterization of these elements among genomes is necessary for the further understanding of their functionality.


RESULTS
we describe an algorithm and provide freely available software which can find all of the ultraconserved sequences between genomes of multiple organisms. our algorithm takes a combinatorial approach that finds all sequences without requiring the genomes to be aligned. the algorithm is significantly faster than blast and is designed to handle very large genomes efficiently. we ran our algorithm on several large comparative analyses to evaluate its effectiveness; one compared  <dig> vertebrate genomes where we find  <dig> ultraconserved elements longer than  <dig> bps shared by all of the organisms, and another compared the human body louse, pediculus humanus humanus, against itself and select insects to find thousands of non-coding, potentially functional sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
whole genome comparative analysis for multiple organisms is both feasible and desirable in our search for biological knowledge. we argue that bioinformatic programs should be forward thinking by assuming analysis on multiple  genomes in the design and implementation of algorithms. our algorithm shows how a compromise design with a trade-off of disk space versus memory space allows for efficient computation while only requiring modest computer resources, and at the same time providing benefits not available with other software.
