BACKGROUND
the detection of any abrupt change in the environment is important to survival. since memory of preceding sensory conditions is necessary for detecting changes, such a change-detection system relates closely to the memory system. here we used an auditory change-related n <dig> subcomponent  of event-related brain potentials to investigate cortical mechanisms underlying change detection and echoic memory.


RESULTS
change-n <dig> was elicited by a simple paradigm with two tones, a standard followed by a deviant, while subjects watched a silent movie. the amplitude of change-n <dig> elicited by a fixed sound pressure deviance  was negatively correlated with the logarithm of the interval between the standard sound and deviant sound , while positively correlated with the logarithm of the duration of the standard sound . the amplitude of change-n <dig> elicited by a deviance in sound pressure, sound frequency, and sound location was correlated with the logarithm of the magnitude of physical differences between the standard and deviant sounds.


CONCLUSIONS
the present findings suggest that temporal representation of echoic memory is non-linear and weber-fechner law holds for the automatic cortical response to sound changes within a suprathreshold range. since the present results show that the behavior of echoic memory can be understood through change-n <dig>  change-n <dig> would be a useful tool to investigate memory systems.
