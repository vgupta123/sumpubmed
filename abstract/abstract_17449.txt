BACKGROUND
enterotoxigenic escherichia coli  is a major cause of diarrhea in children and travelers to endemic areas. secretion of the heat labile ab <dig> toxin  is induced by alkaline conditions. in this study, we determined the surface proteome of etec exposed to alkaline conditions  as compared to neutral conditions  using a lpi hexalane flowcell combined with quantitative proteomics. relative quantitation with isobaric labeling  was used to compare peptide abundance and their corresponding proteins in multiple samples at ms/ms level. for protein identification and quantification samples were analyzed using either a 1d-lcms or a 2d-lcms approach.


RESULTS
strong up-regulation of the atp synthase operon encoding f1fo atp synthase and down-regulation of proton pumping proteins nuof, nuog, ndh and wrba were detected among proteins involved in regulating the proton and electron transport under alkaline conditions. reduced expression of proteins involved in osmotic stress was found at alkaline conditions while the sec-dependent transport over the inner membrane and outer membrane protein proteins such as ompa and the β-barrel assembly machinery  complex were up-regulated.


CONCLUSIONS
etec exposed to alkaline environments express a specific proteome profile characterized by up-regulation of membrane proteins and secretion of lt toxin. alkaline microenvironments have been reported close to the intestinal epithelium and the alkaline proteome may hence represent a better view of etec during infection.
