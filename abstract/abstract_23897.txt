BACKGROUND
the sulfate-reducing bacterium desulfococcus biacutus is able to utilize acetone for growth by an inducible degradation pathway that involves a novel activation reaction for acetone with co as a co-substrate. the mechanism, enzyme and gene involved in this acetone activation reaction are of great interest because they represent a novel and yet undefined type of activation reaction under strictly anoxic conditions.


RESULTS
in this study, a draft genome sequence of d. biacutus was established. sequencing, assembly and annotation resulted in  <dig> contigs with  <dig> , <dig> base pairs and  <dig> predicted genes;  <dig> were predicted protein-encoding genes, and  <dig> of these had a functional prediction. proteins and genes were identified that are specifically induced during growth with acetone. a thiamine diphosphate-requiring enzyme appeared to be highly induced during growth with acetone and is probably involved in the activation reaction. moreover, a coenzyme b12- dependent enzyme and proteins that are involved in redox reactions were also induced during growth with acetone.


CONCLUSIONS
we present for the first time the genome of a sulfate reducer that is able to grow with acetone. the genome information of this organism represents an important tool for the elucidation of a novel reaction mechanism that is employed by a sulfate reducer in acetone activation.
