BACKGROUND
as for other non-model species, genetic analyses in quail will benefit greatly from a higher marker density, now attainable thanks to the evolution of sequencing and genotyping technologies. our objective was to obtain the first genome wide panel of japanese quail snp  and to use it for the fine mapping of a qtl for a fear-related behaviour, namely tonic immobility, previously localized on coturnix japonica chromosome  <dig>  to this aim, two reduced representations of the genome were analysed through high-throughput  <dig> sequencing: aflp  fragments as representatives of genomic dna, and est  as representatives of the transcriptome.


RESULTS
the sequencing runs produced  <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads from cdna and genomic fragments, respectively. they covered over  <dig> mb of sequence in total and allowed us to detect  <dig>  putative snp. among them,  <dig> were used to genotype two advanced intercross lines  obtained from three quail lines differing for duration of tonic immobility. despite the absence of genotyping for founder individuals in the analysis, the previously identified candidate region on chromosome  <dig> was refined and led to the identification of a candidate gene.


CONCLUSIONS
these data confirm the efficiency of transcript and aflp-sequencing for snp discovery in a non-model species, and its application to the fine mapping of a complex trait. our results reveal a significant association of duration of tonic immobility with a genomic region comprising the dmd  gene. further characterization of this candidate gene is needed to decipher its putative role in tonic immobility in coturnix.
