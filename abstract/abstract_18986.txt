BACKGROUND
along with angioplasty, autologus vein grafts are commonly used for artery bypass grafting in patients with advanced arterial stenosis and drug-resistant angina pectoris. although initially a successful procedure, long-term functionality is limited due to proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells. like in atherosclerosis, common chronic infections caused by viruses and bacteria may contribute to this process of vein graft failure. here we investigated the possible role of chlamydia pneumoniae  in the pathogenesis of venous graft failure in an experimental animal model. in  <dig> groups , an epigastric vein-to-common femoral artery interposition graft was placed. immediately thereafter, rats were infected with cpn  or injected with control solutions. rats were sacrificed three weeks after surgery and the grafts were harvested for morphometrical and immunohistochemical analysis.


RESULTS
cpn administration immediately after vein grafting resulted in a significant increase in medial cross-sectional area, wall thickness and total wall area. there were no significant differences in t-cell or macrophage influx. likewise, although positive immunostaining for both hsp <dig> and crp could be detected, no differences were found between groups. based on the observation that the number of cells/Î¼m <dig> was also not altered, we conclude that cpn infection stimulates smooth muscle cell proliferation by hereunto unknown molecular mechanisms, resulting in a significant increase in intimal hyperplasia.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, in a well defined animal model we present here for the first time evidence for a role of chlamydia pneumoniae in the process of venous graft failure.
