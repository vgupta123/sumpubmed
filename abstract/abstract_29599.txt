BACKGROUND
alpha- <dig> proteinase inhibitor  is a plasma serpin superfamily member that inhibits neutrophil elastase; variant api m358r inhibits thrombin and activated protein c . fusing residues 1- <dig> of another serpin, heparin cofactor ii , to api m358r  was previously shown to accelerate thrombin inhibition over api m358r by conferring thrombin exosite  <dig> binding properties. we hypothesized that replacing hcii 1- <dig> region with the  <dig> c-terminal residues  of hirudin variant  <dig>  would further enhance the inhibitory potency of api m358r fusion proteins. we therefore expressed hv3api m358r  and hv3api rcl <dig>  api m358r) as n-terminally hexahistidine-tagged polypeptides in e. coli.


RESULTS
hv3api m358r inhibited thrombin  <dig> -fold more rapidly than api m358r; for hv3api rcl <dig> the rate enhancement was  <dig> -fold versus api rcl5; neither protein inhibited thrombin as rapidly as hapi m358r. while the thrombin/activated protein c rate constant ratio was 77-fold higher for hv3api rcl <dig> than for hv3api m358r, most of the increased specificity derived from the api f352a/l353v/e354v/a355i/i356a/i460l api rcl  <dig> mutations, since api rcl <dig> remained 3-fold more specific than hv3api rcl <dig>  an hv <dig> 54- <dig> peptide doubled the thrombin clotting time  and halved the binding of thrombin to immobilized hcii 1- <dig> at lower concentrations than free hcii 1- <dig>  hv3api rcl <dig> bound active site-inhibited fpr-chloromethyl ketone-thrombin more effectively than hapi rcl <dig>  transferring the position of the fused hv <dig> triskaidecapeptide to the c-terminus of api m358r decreased the rate of thrombin inhibition relative to that mediated by hv3api m358r by 11-to 14-fold.


CONCLUSIONS
fusing the c-terminal triskaidecapeptide of hv <dig> to api m358r-containing serpins significantly increased their effectiveness as thrombin inhibitors, but the enhancement was less than that seen in hcii 1-75â€“api m358r fusion proteins. hcii 1- <dig> was a superior fusion partner, in spite of the greater affinity of the hv <dig> triskaidecapeptide, manifested both in isolated and api-fused form, for thrombin exosite  <dig>  our results suggest that hcii 1- <dig> binds thrombin exosite  <dig> and orients the attached serpin scaffold for more efficient interaction with the active site of thrombin than the hv <dig> triskaidecapeptide.
