BACKGROUND
some species of fungi can cause serious human diseases, particularly to immuno-compromised individuals. opportunistic fungal infections are a leading cause of mortality, and present an emerging challenge that requires development of new and effective therapeutics. aminoacyl-trna synthetases  are indispensable components of cellular protein translation machinery and can be targeted for discovery of novel anti-fungal agents.


RESULTS
validation of aarss as potential drug targets in pathogenic microbes prompted us to investigate the genomic distribution of aarss within three fungi that infect humans – a. niger, c. albicans and c. neoformans. hidden markov models were built for aarss and related proteins to search for homologues in these fungal genomes. here, we provide a detailed and comprehensive annotation for  <dig> fungal genome aarss and their associated proteins. we delineate predicted localizations, subdomain architectures and prevalence of unusual motifs within these aarss. several fungal aarss have unique domain appendages of unknown function e.g. a. niger asxrs and c. neoformans tyrrs have additional domains that are absent from human homologs.


CONCLUSIONS
detailed comparisons of fungal aarss with human homologs suggest key differences that could be exploited for specific drug targeting. our cataloging and structural analyses provide a comprehensive foundation for experimentally dissecting fungal aarss that may enable development of new anti-fungal agents.
