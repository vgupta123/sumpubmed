BACKGROUND
giardia lamblia trophozoites colonize the intestines of susceptible mammals and cause diarrhea, which can be prolonged despite an intestinal immune response. the variable expression of the variant-specific surface protein  genes may contribute to this prolonged infection. only one is expressed at a time, and switching expression from one gene to another occurs by an epigenetic mechanism.


RESULTS
the wb giardia isolate has been sequenced at 10Ã— coverage and assembled into  <dig> contigs as large as  <dig> kb in size. we have used this assembly to evaluate the genomic organization and evolution of the vsp repertoire. we have identified  <dig> complete and  <dig> partial vsp gene sequences for an estimated repertoire of  <dig> to  <dig>  making up about 4% of the genome. the vsp gene diversity includes  <dig> genes containing tandem repeats, and  <dig> vsp pairs of identical genes present in either head to head or tail to tail configurations , where the two genes are separated by  <dig> to  <dig> kb of non-coding dna. interestingly, over half the total vsp repertoire is present in the form of linear gene arrays that can contain up to  <dig> vsp gene members. lastly, evidence for recombination within and across minor clades of vsp genes is provided.


CONCLUSIONS
the data we present here is the first comprehensive analysis of the vsp gene family from the genotype a <dig> wb isolate with an emphasis on vsp characterization, function, evolution and contributions to pathogenesis of this important pathogen.
