BACKGROUND
bacteria of the genus bartonella are responsible for a large variety of human and animal diseases. serological typing of bartonella is a method that can be used for differentiation and identification of bartonella subspecies.


RESULTS
we have developed a novel multiple antigenic microarray to serotype bartonella strains and to select poly and monoclonal antibodies. it was validated using mouse polyclonal antibodies against  <dig> bartonella strains. we then tested the microarray for serotyping of bartonella strains and defining the profile of monoclonal antibodies.

bartonella strains gave a strong positive signal and all were correctly identified. screening of monoclonal antibodies towards the gro el protein of b. clarridgeiae identified  <dig> groups of antibodies, which were observed with variable affinities against bartonella strains.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that microarray of spotted bacteria can be a practical tool for serotyping of unidentified strains or species  by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. this could be used in research and for identification of bacterial strains.
