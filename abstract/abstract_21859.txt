BACKGROUND
feline infectious peritonitis is a fatal disease of cats caused by infection with feline coronavirus . for detecting or genotyping of fcov, some rt-pcr plus nested pcr techniques have been reported previously. however, referring to the whole genome sequences  registered at ncbi, there are no detection methods that can tolerate the genetic diversity among fcov population. in addition, the quasispecies nature of fcov, which consists of heterogeneous variants, has been also demonstrated; thus, a universal method for heteropopulations of fcov variants in clinical specimens is desirable.


RESULTS
to develop an rt-pcr method for detection and genotyping of fcov, we performed comparative genome analysis using wgss of  <dig> fcov,  <dig> ccov and  <dig> tgev strains obtained from ncbi. as the pcr target, we focused on the nsp <dig> coding region, which is highly conserved and phylogenetically informative, and developed a pcr method targeting nsp <dig> partial sequences. among  <dig> ascites,  <dig> pleural effusion and  <dig> blood specimens from clinically ill cats, we could detect fcov in  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  specimens using the present method. direct sequencing of pcr products and phylogenetic analysis allowed discrimination between type i- and ii-fcov serotypes. our nsp <dig> amino acid sequence typing  showed that the fcov clone with sequence type   <dig>  which was the most predominant genotype of wgs strains, was prevalent in domestic cats in japan.


CONCLUSIONS
our nsp <dig> pcr scheme will contribute to virus detection, epidemiology and ecology of fcov strains.
