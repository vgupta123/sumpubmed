BACKGROUND
clostridium tetani and clostridium perfringens are among the medically important clostridial pathogens causing diseases in man and animals. several homologous open reading frames  have been identified in the genomes of the two pathogens by comparative genomic analysis. we tested a likelihood of extensive sharing of common epitopes between homologous proteins of these two medically important pathogens and the possibility of cross-protection using active immunization.


RESULTS
eight predominant cross-reactive spots were identified by mass spectrometry and had hits in the c. tetani e <dig> proteome with significant mowse scores. most of the cross-reactive proteins of c. tetani shared 65â€“78% sequence similarity with their closest homologues in c. perfringens atcc <dig>  electron transfer flavoprotein beta-subunit  was the most abundant protein , followed by methylaspartate ammonia-lyase  and 2-phosphoglycerate dehydratase . all the proteins were predicted to be cytoplasmic by psort protein localization algorithm. active immunization with c. perfringens whole cells elicited cross-protective immunity against c. tetani infection in a mouse model.


CONCLUSIONS
most of the dominant cross-reactive proteins of c. tetani belonged to the cluster of orthologous group  functional category, either of posttranslational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones  or energy production and conversion . the homologs of the identified proteins have been shown to play role in pathogenesis in other gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. our findings provide basis for the search of potential vaccine candidates with broader coverage, encompassing more than one pathogenic clostridial species.
