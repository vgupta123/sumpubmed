BACKGROUND
effective and stable knockdown of multiple gene targets by rna interference is often necessary to overcome isoform redundancy, but it remains a technical challenge when working with intractable cell systems.


RESULTS
we have developed a flexible platform using rna polymerase ii promoter-driven expression of microrna-like short hairpin rnas which permits robust depletion of multiple target genes from a single transcript. recombination-based subcloning permits expression of multi-shrna transcripts from a comprehensive range of plasmid or viral vectors. retroviral delivery of transcripts targeting isoforms of camp-dependent protein kinase in the raw <dig>  murine macrophage cell line emphasizes the utility of this approach and provides insight to camp-dependent transcription.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate functional consequences of depleting multiple endogenous target genes using mir-shrnas, and highlight the versatility of the described vector platform for multiple target gene knockdown in mammalian cells.
