BACKGROUND
microarray time series studies are essential to understand the dynamics of molecular events. in order to limit the analysis to those genes that change expression over time, a first necessary step is to select differentially expressed transcripts. a variety of methods have been proposed to this purpose; however, these methods are seldom applicable in practice since they require a large number of replicates, often available only for a limited number of samples. in this data-poor context, we evaluate the performance of three selection methods, using synthetic data, over a range of experimental conditions. application to real data is also discussed.


RESULTS
three methods are considered, to assess differentially expressed genes in data-poor conditions. method  <dig> uses a threshold on individual samples based on a model of the experimental error. method  <dig> calculates the area of the region bounded by the time series expression profiles, and considers the gene differentially expressed if the area exceeds a threshold based on a model of the experimental error. these two methods are compared to method  <dig>  recently proposed in the literature, which exploits splines fit to compare time series profiles. application of the three methods to synthetic data indicates that method  <dig> outperforms the other two both in precision and recall when short time series are analyzed, while method  <dig> outperforms the other two for long time series.


CONCLUSIONS
these results help to address the choice of the algorithm to be used in data-poor time series expression study, depending on the length of the time series.
