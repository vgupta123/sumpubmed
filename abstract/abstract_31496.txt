BACKGROUND
bacterial small rnas  regulate gene expression by base-pairing with downstream target mrnas to attenuate translation of mrna into protein at the post-transcriptional level. in response to specific environmental changes, srnas can modulate the expression levels of target genes, thus enabling adaptation of cellular physiology.


RESULTS
we profiled srna expression in the gram-negative bacteria burkholderia thailandensis cultured under  <dig> distinct growth conditions using a burkholderia-specific microarray that contains probe sets to all intergenic regions greater than  <dig> bases. we identified  <dig> novel srnas and performed experimental validation on five srnas that play a role in adaptation of burkholderia to cell stressors. in particular, the trans-encoded bth_s <dig> and s <dig> exhibited differential expression profiles dependent on growth phase and cell stimuli, such as antibiotics and serum. furthermore, knockdown of the highly-expressed bth_s <dig> by antisense transcripts reduced b. thailandensis cell growth and attenuated host immune response upon infection, indicating that bth_s <dig> functions in bacterial metabolism and adaptation to the host. in addition, expression of cis-encoded bth_s <dig> and s <dig> found in the 5′ untranslated regions of their cognate genes correlated with tight regulation of gene transcript levels. this srna-mediated downregulation of gene expression may be a conserved mechanism of post-transcriptional gene dosage control.


CONCLUSIONS
these studies provide a broad analysis of differential burkholderia srna expression profiles and illustrate the complexity of bacterial gene regulation in response to different environmental stress conditions.
