BACKGROUND
the cytochrome p <dig> aromatase , catalyses the aromatisation of androgens to estrogens, a key mechanism in vertebrate reproductive physiology. a current evolutionary hypothesis suggests that cyp <dig> gene arose at the origin of vertebrates, given that it has not been found outside this clade. the human cyp <dig> gene is located in one of the proposed mhc-paralogon regions . at present it is unclear whether this genomic location is ancestral  or derived . the distinction between these possibilities should help to clarify the timing of the cyp <dig> emergence and which taxa should be investigated.


RESULTS
here we determine the "genomic environment" around cyp <dig> in three vertebrate species homo sapiens, tetraodon nigroviridis and xenopus tropicalis. paralogy studies and phylogenetic analysis of six gene families suggests that the cyp <dig> gene region was structured through "en bloc" genomic duplication . four gene families have specifically duplicated in the vertebrate lineage. moreover, the mapping location of the different paralogues is consistent with a model of "en bloc" duplication. furthermore, we also determine that this region has retained the same gene content since the divergence of actinopterygii and tetrapods. a single inversion in gene order has taken place, probably in the mammalian lineage. finally, we describe the first invertebrate cyp <dig> sequence, from branchiostoma floridae.


CONCLUSIONS
contrary to previous suggestions, our data indicates an invertebrate origin for the aromatase gene, given the striking conservation pattern in both gene order and gene content, and the presence of aromatase in amphioxus. we propose that cyp <dig> duplicated in the vertebrate lineage to yield four paralogues, followed by the subsequent loss of all but one gene in vertebrate evolution. finally, we suggest that agnathans and lophotrocozoan protostomes should be investigated for the presence of aromatase.
