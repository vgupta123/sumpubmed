BACKGROUND
the general control nonderepressible  <dig>  kinase is a conserved member of the integrated stress response  pathway that represses protein translation and helps cells to adapt to conditions of nutrient shortage. as such, gcn <dig> is required for longevity and stress resistance induced by dietary restriction . impact is an ancient protein that inhibits gcn <dig> 


RESULTS
here, we tested whether impact down-regulation mimics the effects of dr in c. elegans. knockdown of the c. elegans impact homolog impt- <dig> activated the isr pathway and increased lifespan and stress resistance of worms in a gcn-2-dependent manner. impt- <dig> knockdown exacerbated dr-induced longevity and required several dr-activated transcription factors to extend lifespan, among them skn- <dig> and daf- <dig>  which were induced during larval development and adulthood, respectively, in response to impt- <dig> rnai.


CONCLUSIONS
impact inhibits the isr pathway, thus limiting the activation of stress response factors that are beneficial during aging and required under dr.
