BACKGROUND
prevention of a possible avian influenza pandemic necessitates the development of rapid diagnostic tests and the eventual production of a vaccine.


RESULTS
for vaccine production, hemagglutinin  from avian influenza h5n <dig> was expressed from a recombinant baculovirus. recombinant ha <dig> was expressed in monolayer or suspension culture insect cells by infection with the recombinant baculovirus. the yield of rha <dig> from the suspension culture was  <dig> mg/l, compared to  <dig> mg/l from the monolayer culture. immunization of guinea pigs with  <dig> Î¼g of rha <dig> yielded hemagglutinin inhibition and virus neutralization titers of 1: <dig> after two times vaccination with rha <dig> protein.


CONCLUSIONS
thus, the production of rha <dig> using an insect suspension cell system provides a promising basis for economical production of a h <dig> antigen.
