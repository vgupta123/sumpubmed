BACKGROUND
molecular programs employed by mycobacterium tuberculosis  for the establishment of non-replicating persistence  are poorly understood. in order to investigate mechanisms regulating entry into nrp, we asked how cell cycle regulation is linked to downstream adaptations that ultimately result in nrp. based on previous reports and our recent studies, we reason that, in order to establish nrp, cells are halted in the cell cycle at the point of septum formation by coupled regulatory mechanisms.


RESULTS
using bioinformatic consensus modeling, we identified an alternative cell cycle regulatory element, sojmtb encoded by rv <dig>  sojmtb coordinates a regulatory mechanism involving cell cycle control at the point of septum formation and elicits the induction of the mazf <dig> toxin. mazf <dig> functions as an mrna interferase leading to bacteriostasis that can be prevented by interaction with its cognate antitoxin, maze <dig>  further, mazef <dig> acts independently of other maz family toxin:antitoxin pairs. notably, soj
mtb
 and mazef <dig> transcripts where identified at  <dig>   <dig> and 100Â days post-infection in increasing abundance indicating a role in adaption during chronic infection.


CONCLUSIONS
here we present the first evidence of a coupled regulatory system in which cell cycle regulation via sojmtb is linked to downstream adaptations that are facilitated through the activity of the mazef <dig> ta pair.
