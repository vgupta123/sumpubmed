BACKGROUND
cultivated cotton is an annual fiber crop derived mainly from two perennial species, gossypium hirsutum l. or upland cotton, and g. barbadense l., extra long-staple fiber pima or egyptian cotton. these two cultivated species are among five allotetraploid species presumably derived monophyletically between g. arboreum and g. raimondii. genomic-based approaches have been hindered by the limited variation within species. yet, population-based methods are being used for genome-wide introgression of novel alleles from g. mustelinum and g. tomentosum into g. hirsutum using combinations of backcrossing, selfing, and inter-mating. recombinant inbred line populations between genetics standards tm- <dig>   Ã— 3- <dig>  have been developed to allow high-density genetic mapping of traits.


RESULTS
this paper describes a strategy to efficiently characterize genomic variation  within and among cotton species. over  <dig> snps from  <dig> loci and  <dig> indels from  <dig> loci segregating in g. hirsutum and g. barbadense were genotyped across a standard panel of  <dig> lines,  <dig> of which are elite cotton breeding lines and  <dig> mapping parents of populations from six cotton species. over  <dig> loci were genetically mapped in a core mapping population derived from tm- <dig> and 3- <dig> and in g. hirsutum breeding germplasm.


CONCLUSIONS
in this research, snp and indel diversity is characterized for  <dig> single-copy polymorphic loci in cotton. a strategy for snp discovery is defined to pre-screen loci for copy number and polymorphism. our data indicate that the a and d genomes in both diploid and tetraploid cotton remain distinct from each such that paralogs can be distinguished. this research provides mapped dna markers for intra-specific crosses and introgression of exotic germplasm in cotton.
