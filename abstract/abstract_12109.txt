BACKGROUND
computational modeling transcription factor  sequence specificity is an important research topic in regulatory genomics. a systematic comparison of  <dig> algorithms to learn tf-dna binding specificity in in vitro protein-binding microarray  data was published recently, but the quality of those examined pbms was not evaluated completely.


RESULTS
here, new quality-control parameters such as principal component analysis  ellipse is proposed to assess the data quality for either single or paired pbms. additionally, a biophysical model of tf-dna interactions including adjacent dinucleotide interdependence was implemented in a new program - bayespi <dig>  where sparse bayesian learning and relevance vector machine are used to predict unknown model parameters. then,  <dig> mouse tfs from the dream <dig> challenge were classified into two groups  based on the paired pbm quality-control parameters. subsequently, computational methods to model tf sequence specificity were evaluated between the two groups.


CONCLUSIONS
results indicate that both the algorithm performance and the predicted tf-binding energy-level of a motif are significantly influenced by pbm data quality, where poor pbm data quality is linked to specific protein domains . especially, the new dinucleotide energy-dependent model  offers great improvement in testing prediction accuracy over the simple energy-independent model, for at least 21% of analyzed the tfs.
