BACKGROUND
tumor-associated macrophages  have high impact on the cancer development because they can facilitate matrix invasion, angiogenesis, and tumor cell motility. it gives cancer cells the capacity to invade normal tissues and metastasize. the signaling of colony-stimulating factor- <dig> receptor  which is an important regulator of proliferation and differentiation of monocytes and macrophages regulates most of the tissue macrophages. however, csf-1r is expressed also in breast epithelial tissue during some physiological stages i.g.: pregnancy and lactation. its expression has been also detected in various cancers. our previous study has showed the expression of csf-1r in all examined canine mammary tumors. moreover, it strongly correlated with grade of malignancy and ability to metastasis. this study was therefore designed to characterize the role of csf-1r in canine mammary cancer cells proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. as far as we know, the study presented hereby is a pioneering experiment in this field of veterinary medicine.


RESULTS
we showed that csf-1r silencing significantly increased apoptosis , decreased proliferation  and decreased migration  of canine mammary cancer cells. treatment of these cells with csf- <dig> caused opposite effect. moreover, csf-1r knock-down changed growth characteristics of highly invasive cell lines on matrigel matrix, and significantly decreased the ability of these cells to invade matrix. csf- <dig> treatment increased invasion of cancer cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the evidence of the expression and functional role of the csf-1r in canine mammary cancer cells indicate that csf-1r targeting may be a good therapeutic approach.
