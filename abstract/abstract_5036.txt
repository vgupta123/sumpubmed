BACKGROUND
heat-induced browning  of seed coats is caused by high temperatures which discolors the seed coats of many legumes, affecting the visual appearance and quality of seeds. the genetic determinants underlying hbs in cowpea are unknown.


RESULTS
we identified three qtl associated with the heat-induced browning of seed coats trait, hbs- <dig>  hbs- <dig> and hbs- <dig>  using cowpea ril populations it93k-503- <dig>  x cb <dig>  and it84s- <dig>  x tvu <dig> . hbs- <dig> was identified in both populations, accounting for  <dig> % - <dig> % of the phenotypic variation. snp markers 1_ <dig> and 1_ <dig> co-segregated with the trait. within the syntenic regions of hbs- <dig> in soybean, medicago and common bean, several ethylene forming enzymes, ethylene responsive element binding factors and an acc oxidase  <dig> were observed. hbs- <dig> was identified in a bac clone in contig  <dig> of the cowpea physical map, where ethylene forming enzymes were present. hbs- <dig> was identified in the it93k-503- <dig> x cb <dig> population and accounted for of  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. hbs- <dig> was identified in the it84s- <dig> x tvu <dig> population and accounted for  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. snp marker 1_ <dig> co-segregated with the heat-induced browning phenotype. hbs- <dig> was positioned on bac clones in contig <dig> of the cowpea physical map, where several acc synthase  <dig> genes were present.


CONCLUSIONS
the identification of loci determining heat-induced browning of seed coats and co-segregating molecular markers will enable transfer of hbs alleles into cowpea varieties, contributing to higher quality seeds.
