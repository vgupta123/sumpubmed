BACKGROUND
the commercial pet-food industry and the market value of the pet industry have increased. most owners are concerned about their pets’ health, and prefer commercial pet foods as their regular diet. this study thus aimed to determine whether a selection of local generic-brand dry canine foods had any potential to promote chronic disease.

methods
five local, generic-brand, dry canine foods were studied for potential mutagenicity; the effects of long-term consumption were also observed in rats. all canine foods were extracted with distilled water and absolute ethanol. the ames test was used to detect short-term genetic damage, using salmonella typhimurium tester strains ta <dig> and ta <dig>  simultaneously, the long-term effects were studied in an animal model by observing rats fed with these canine foods, compared with normal rat food, for a period of  <dig> weeks.


RESULTS
using the water extracts, all dry canine foods studied showed considerable mutagenic effects on the tester strains. one brand affected both tester strains, whereas  <dig> showed positive to ta <dig>  and one to ta <dig>  with the absolute ethanol extract, three of the five brands had a considerable mutagenic effect on ta <dig>  and another affected ta <dig>  in the long-term test, all rats remained alive until the end of the experiment, exhibited no apparent signs of toxicity or serious illness, and maintained normal bodyweight and weight gain. serum blood biochemistry and hematological parameters in canine food-fed rats showed some negative effects. correspondingly, histopathological investigation of their liver and kidneys showed deterioration.


CONCLUSIONS
mutagenic potential and the negative potential health impacts were observed in all local-brand dry canine foods tested.
