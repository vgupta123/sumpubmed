BACKGROUND
glucagon-like peptide  <dig>  analogs protect a variety of cell types against oxidative damage and vascular and neuronal injury via binding to glp- <dig> receptors. this study aimed to investigate the effects of the glp- <dig> analogs exendin- <dig> and liraglutide on cerebral blood flow, reactive oxygen species production, expression of oxidative stress-related proteins, cognition, and pelvic sympathetic nerve-mediated bladder contraction after middle cerebral artery occlusion  injury in the db/db mouse model of diabetes.


RESULTS
sixty minutes of mcao increased blood and brain reactive oxygen species counts in male db/db mice, as revealed by dihydroethidium staining. mcao also increased nuclear factor-κb and intercellular adhesion molecule- <dig> expression and decreased cerebral microcirculation. these effects were attenuated by treatment with exendin- <dig> or liraglutide. mcao did not affect basal levels of phosphorylated akt  or endothelial nitric oxide synthase ; however, exendin- <dig> and liraglutide treatments significantly enhanced p-akt and p-enos levels, indicating activation of the p-akt/p-enos signaling pathway. mcao-induced motor and cognitive deficits and micturition dysfunction, indicated by reduced pelvic nerve-mediated voiding contractions and increased nonvoiding contractions, were also partially attenuated by exendin- <dig> treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
the above data indicate that treatment with glp- <dig> agonists exerts protective effects against oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic damage in brain areas that control parasympathetic/pelvic nerve-mediated voiding contractions and cognitive and motor behaviors in a diabetic mouse model.
