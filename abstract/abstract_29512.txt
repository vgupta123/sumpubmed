BACKGROUND
transcription factors  are core functional proteins which play important roles in gene expression control, and they are key factors for gene regulation network construction. traditionally, they were identified and classified through experimental approaches. in order to save time and reduce costs, many computational methods have been developed to identify tfs from new proteins and to classify the resulted tfs. though these methods have facilitated screening of tfs to some extent, low accuracy is still a common problem. with the fast growing number of new proteins, more precise algorithms for identifying tfs from new proteins and classifying the consequent tfs are in a high demand.


RESULTS
the support vector machine  algorithm was utilized to construct an automatic detector for tf identification, where protein domains and functional sites were employed as feature vectors. error-correcting output coding  algorithm, which was originated from information and communication engineering fields, was introduced to combine with support vector machine  methodology for tf classification. the overall success rates of identification and classification achieved  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. finally, a web site was constructed to let users access our tools .


CONCLUSIONS
the svm method was a valid and stable means for tfs identification with protein domains and functional sites as feature vectors. error-correcting output coding  algorithm is a powerful method for multi-class classification problem. when combined with svm method, it can remarkably increase the accuracy of tf classification using protein domains and functional sites as feature vectors. in addition, our work implied that ecoc algorithm may succeed in a broad range of applications in biological data mining.
