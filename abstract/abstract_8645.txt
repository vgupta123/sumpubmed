BACKGROUND
β-1→3-d-glucans represent a pathogen-associated molecular pattern and are able to modify biological responses. employing a comprehensive methodological approach, the aim of our in vitro study was to elucidate novel molecular and cellular mechanisms of human peripheral blood immune cells mediated by a fungal β-1→3-d-glucan, i.e. glucan phosphate, in the presence of lipopolysaccharide  or toxic shock syndrome toxin  <dig> .


RESULTS
despite an activation of nuclear factor κb, nfinterleukin- <dig> and nfat similar to lps or tsst- <dig>  we observed no significant production of il-1β, il- <dig>  tumor necrosis factor α or interferon γ induced by glucan phosphate. glucan phosphate-treated leukocytes induced a substantial amount of il- <dig> , likely due to binding of nfκb to a consensus site in the il- <dig> promoter. an increase in il-1receptor antagonist production  by glucan phosphate-treated cells positively correlated with il- <dig> levels. glucan phosphate induced significant binding to a known nfil- <dig> site and a new nfat site within the il-1ra promoter, which was confirmed by inhibition experiments. when applied in combination with either lps or tsst- <dig> at the same time points, we detected that glucan phosphate elevated the lps- and the tsst-1-induced dna binding of nfκb, nfil- <dig> and nfat, leading to a synergistic increase of il-1ra. further, glucan phosphate modulated the tsst-1-induced inflammatory response via reduction of il-1β and il- <dig>  as a consequence, glucan phosphate shifted the tsst-1-induced il-1β/il-1ra ratio towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype. subsequently, glucan phosphate decreased the tsst-1-induced, il-1-dependent production of il- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
thus, β-1→3-d-glucans may induce beneficial effects in the presence of pro-inflammatory responses, downstream of receptor binding and signaling by switching a pro- to an anti-inflammatory il-1ra-mediated reaction. our results also offer new insights into the complex regulation of the il-1ra gene, which can be modulated by a β-1→3-d-glucan.
