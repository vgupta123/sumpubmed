BACKGROUND
viral upper respiratory tract infections are associated with increased colonization by streptococcus pneumoniae but the mechanisms underlying this relationship are unclear. the objective of this study is to describe a comprehensive picture of the cellular interaction between the adhering bacteria and host cells in the presence or absence of a viral co-infection.


RESULTS
gene expression profiles of detroit- <dig> pharyngeal cells, which were either mock-infected or infected with human respiratory syncytial virus  or human parainfluenza virus  <dig> , were analyzed using human microarrays. transcription response of s. pneumoniae strain tigr <dig>  in the presence of either mock- or viral-infected cells was analyzed by pneumococcal microarray. significantly regulated genes were identified by both significance analysis of microarray  and a ≥ 2-fold change ratio cut-off. the adherence of s. pneumoniae to human pharyngeal cells was significantly augmented in the presence of rsv or hpiv <dig> infection. global gene expression profiling of the host cells during infection with rsv or hpiv <dig> revealed increased transcription of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules , cd <dig>  fibronectin, interferon-stimulated genes and many other host cell adhesion molecules. pneumococci increased transcription of several genes involved in adhesive functions , choline uptake and incorporation , as well as transport and binding.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a core transcriptome that represents the basic machinery required for adherence of pneumococci to d <dig> cells infected or not infected with a virus. these bacterial genes and cell adhesion molecules can potentially be used to control pneumococcal adherence occurring secondary to a viral infection.
