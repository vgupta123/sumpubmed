BACKGROUND
embryonic stem cell-specific gene   <dig>  which encodes a kh-domain containing protein, is specifically expressed in early embryos, germ cells, and embryonic stem  cells. previous studies identified genomic clones containing the mouse esg <dig> gene and five pseudogenes. however, their chromosomal localizations or physiological functions have not been determined.


RESULTS
a blast search of mouse genomic databases failed to locate the esg <dig> gene. we identified several bacterial artificial clones containing the mouse esg <dig> gene and an additional esg1-like sequence with a similar gene structure from chromosome  <dig>  the esg1-like sequence contained a multiple critical mutations, indicating that it was a duplicated pseudogene. the 5' flanking region of the esg <dig> gene, but not that of the pseudogene, exhibited strong enhancer and promoter activity in undifferentiated es cells by luciferase reporter assay. to study the physiological functions of the esg <dig> gene, we replaced this sequence in es cells with a Î²-geo cassette by homologous recombination. despite specific expression in early embryos and germ cells, esg1-/- mice developed normally and were fertile. we also generated esg1-/- es cells both by a second independent homologous recombination and directly from blastocysts derived from heterozygous intercrosses. northern blot and western blot analyses confirmed the absence of esg <dig> in these cells. these es cells demonstrated normal morphology, proliferation, and differentiation.


CONCLUSIONS
the mouse esg <dig> gene, together with a duplicated pseudogene, is located on chromosome  <dig>  despite its specific expression in pluripotent cells and germ cells, esg <dig> is dispensable for self-renewal of es cells and establishment of germcells.
