BACKGROUND
evolutionary biologists have so far largely treated the testis as a black box with a certain size, a matching resource demand and a resulting sperm output. a better understanding of the way that the testis responds to selection may come from recent developments in theoretical biology aimed at understanding the factors that influence the evolution of tissue architecture . here we perform a comparative analysis of aspects of testicular architecture of the fruit fly family drosophilidae. specifically, we collect published information on the number of first  spermatocytes in spermatogenesis, which allows to infer an important aspect of testicular architecture.


RESULTS
we show that testicular architecture is much more variable  than is generally appreciated. moreover, the number of first spermatocytes is strongly correlated to the sperm length, which is inversely related to the sperm production, and thus the workload of the testis.


CONCLUSIONS
our study clearly documents that tissue architecture can evolve, and that in the drosophilidae it may do so in response to sexual selection. we conclude that the testis of the drosophilidae is a promising model organ to test recent models of tissue architecture.
