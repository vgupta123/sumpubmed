BACKGROUND
stenotrophomonas maltophilia is emerging as one of the most frequently found bacteria in cystic fibrosis  patients. in the present study, phenotypic and genotypic traits of a set of  <dig> isolates of s. maltophilia obtained from clinical  and environmental sources were comparatively evaluated.


RESULTS
s. maltophilia exhibited a high level of genomic diversity in both cf and non-cf group, thus possibly allowing this bacterium to expand its pathogenic potentials. strains sharing the same pulsotype infected different patients, thus likely indicating the occurrence of clonal spread or acquisition by a common source. cf isolates differed greatly in some phenotypic traits among each other and also when compared with non-cf isolates, demonstrating increased mean generation time and susceptibility to oxidative stress, but reduced ability in forming biofilm. furthermore, in cf isolates flagella- and type iv pili-based motilities were critical for biofilm development, although not required for its initiation. sequential isogenic strains isolated from the same cf patient displayed heterogeneity in biofilm and other phenotypic traits during the course of chronic infection. cf and non-cf isolates showed comparable virulence in a mouse model of lung infection.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, the phenotypic differences observed between cf and non-cf isolates may imply different selective conditions and persistence  mechanisms in a hostile and heterogeneous environment such as cf lung. molecular elucidation of these mechanisms will be essential to better understand the selective adaptation in cf airways in order to design improved strategies useful to counteract and eradicate s. maltophilia infection.
