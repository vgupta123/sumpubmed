BACKGROUND
propofol is a widely used injectable anesthetic agent for induction and short-term maintenance in dogs. a multi-dose formulation of propofol  has been developed which includes 2% benzyl alcohol as a preservative. in order to document the use of the product under clinical conditions, mdp was tested in a prospective clinical trial conducted at six sites within the united states. one hundred thirty-eight healthy, client-owned dogs were assigned to one of six treatment groups based on premedicants  and maintenance agents . anesthesia was induced by the intravenous administration of mdp given to effect. physiological indices including heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure were monitored prior to and during anesthesia induction, maintenance and recovery. adverse events, defined for severity by pre-established limits of these physiological values, as well as side effects, defined as any observation outside the normal range, were noted.


RESULTS
the mean intubation dose was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/kg for mdp alone and  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/kg and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/kg when buprenorphine was used in combination with midazolam, acepromazine and medetomidine, respectively. of the  <dig> adverse events, apnea , bradycardia  and hypotension  were most frequently recorded. emesis, cyanosis and second degree heart block were each noted once and successfully resolved. the cause of a single death 2 days post-anesthesia was assessed as a surgical complication.


CONCLUSIONS
mdp was found to be acceptable for use in healthy dogs for induction and short term maintenance of anesthesia when used alone and in combination with premedicants and inhaled anesthetics.
