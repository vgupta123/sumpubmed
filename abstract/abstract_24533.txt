BACKGROUND
a ril population between solanum lycopersicum cv. moneymaker and s. pimpinellifolium g <dig>  was genotyped with a custom made snp array. additionally, a subset of the lines was genotyped by sequencing .


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> polymorphic snps were selected to develop a linkage map of  <dig> unique genetic loci. we generated plots for visualizing the recombination patterns of the population relating physical and genetic positions along the genome.

this linkage map was used to identify two qtls for tylcv resistance which contained favourable alleles derived from s. pimpinellifolium. further gbs was used to saturate regions of interest, and the mapping resolution of the two qtls was improved. the analysis showed highest significance on chromosome  <dig> close to the region of  <dig>  mb  and another on chromosome  <dig> near  <dig>  mb . furthermore, we explored the population using untargeted metabolic profiling, and the most significant differences between susceptible and resistant plants were mainly associated with sucrose and flavonoid glycosides.


CONCLUSIONS
the snp information obtained from an array allowed a first qtl screening of our ril population. with additional snp data of a rils subset, obtained through gbs, we were able to perform an in silico mapping improvement to further confirm regions associated with our trait of interest. with the combination of different ~ omics platforms we provide valuable insight into the genetics of s. pimpinellifolium-derived tylcv resistance.
