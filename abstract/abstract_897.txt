BACKGROUND
recognition of pathogens by dendritic cells  through interaction with pattern recognition receptors, including toll like receptors , is crucial for the initiation of appropriate polarized t helper  cell responses. yet, the characteristics and differences in molecular profiles of dcs with different t cell polarizing capacities are still poorly defined. to address this issue, the molecular profile of human monocyte derived dcs was characterized after exposure to tlr <dig> ligand lps in combination with the th <dig> promoting bacterial extracts from listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli or the th <dig> promoting helminth derived phospholipids from schistosoma mansoni and ascaris lumbricoides, all with tlr <dig> activating capacity.


RESULTS
with regard to the signalling pathways activated upon exposure to lps and the tlr <dig> activating compounds, we find that the ratio of activated mitogen activated protein kinases  p-erk/p-p <dig> is lower in dcs stimulated with the bacterial products compared to dcs stimulated with the helminth products, which correlates with the th <dig> and th <dig> polarizing capacity of these compounds. furthermore, analysis of the mrna expression levels of a set of  <dig> carefully selected genes potentially involved in modulation of t cell polarization revealed that the mrna expression of notch ligand delta- <dig> and transcription factor c-fos are differentially regulated and show a strong correlation with th <dig> and th <dig> polarization, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that combined tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> activation in the context of different antigen sources can induce very distinct molecular profiles in dcs and suggests that the th1/th <dig> polarizing capacity of compounds can be predicted with the molecular signature they induce in dcs.
