BACKGROUND
quorum sensing is a process of bacterial cell-to-cell communication involving the production and detection of extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers. recently, it has been proposed that autoinducer- <dig> , a furanosyl borate diester derived from the recycling of s-adenosyl-homocysteine  to homocysteine, serves as a universal signal for interspecies communication.


RESULTS
in this study,  <dig> completed genomes were examined for the genes involved in the synthesis and detection of ai- <dig>  except for some symbionts and parasites, all organisms have a pathway to recycle sah, either using a two-step enzymatic conversion by the pfs and luxs enzymes or a one-step conversion using sah-hydrolase .  <dig> organisms including most gamma-, beta-, and epsilonproteobacteria, and firmicutes possess the pfs-luxs pathway, while archaea, eukarya, alphaproteobacteria, actinobacteria and cyanobacteria prefer the sahh pathway. in all  <dig> organisms, only the three vibrio strains had strong, bidirectional matches to the periplasmic ai- <dig> binding protein luxp and the central signal relay protein luxu. the initial two-component sensor kinase protein luxq, and the terminal response regulator luxo are found in most proteobacteria, as well as in some firmicutes, often in several copies.


CONCLUSIONS
the genomic analysis indicates that the luxs enzyme required for ai- <dig> synthesis is widespread in bacteria, while the periplasmic binding protein luxp is only present in vibrio strains. thus, other organisms may either use components different from the ai- <dig> signal transduction system of vibrio strains to sense the signal of ai- <dig>  or they do not have such a quorum sensing system at all.
