BACKGROUND
undaria pinnatifida is an important economic brown alga in east asian countries. however, its genetic and genomic information is very scarce, which hinders further research in this species. a high-density genetic map is a basic tool for fundamental and applied research such as discovery of functional genes and mapping of quantitative trait loci . in this study the recently developed specific length amplified fragment sequencing  technology was employed to construct a high-density genetic linkage map and locate a sex determining locus for u. pinnatifida.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  gb data including  <dig>  m pair-end reads was obtained. after linkage analysis  <dig> slaf markers were mapped onto the genetic map. after adding the sex linked simple sequence repeat  marker , the final genetic map was  <dig>  cm long, consisting of  <dig> linkage groups with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. the length of lgs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm. a major sex associated qtl was mapped to lg <dig> within a window starting at  <dig>  cm and ending at  <dig>  cm with a total of  <dig> slaf markers. the ssr marker and five slaf markers  were identified as tightly sex-linked markers, as indicated by the absence of recombination between them and the sex phenotype. these markers were located at the position of  <dig>  cm, which was supposed to be the sex determining region.


CONCLUSIONS
a high-density genetic linkage map was constructed using slaf-seq technique and f <dig> gametophyte population for the first time in the economically important brown alga u. pinnatifida. for the first time, a major sex associated qtl suggesting a sex determining region was mapped to a single lg. this map will facilitate the further fundamental and applied research such as qtl mapping and map-based gene clone in u. pinnatifida and provide a reference for studies in other kelp species.
