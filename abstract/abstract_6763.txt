BACKGROUND
insufficient leukocyte recruitment may be one reason for the high incidence of life-threatening infections in preterm infants. since the receptor of advanced glycation end products  is a known leukocyte adhesion molecule and highly expressed during early development, we asked whether rage plays a role for leukocyte recruitment in preterm and term infants.

methods
leukocyte adhesion was analyzed in dynamic flow chamber experiments using isolated leukocytes of cord blood from extremely premature , moderately premature  and mature neonates  and compared to the results of adults. for fluorescent microscopy leukocytes were labeled with rhodamine 6g. in the respective age groups we also measured the plasma concentration of soluble rage  by elisa and mac- <dig> and lfa- <dig> expression on neutrophils by flow cytometry.


RESULTS
the adhesive functions of fetal leukocytes significantly increase with gestational age. in all age groups, leukocyte adhesion was crucially dependent on rage. in particular, rage was equally effective to mediate leukocyte adhesion when compared to icam- <dig>  the plasma levels of srage were high in extremely premature infants and decreased with increasing gestational age. in contrast, expression of β2-integrins mac- <dig> and lfa- <dig> which are known ligands for rage and icam- <dig> did not change during fetal development.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that rage is a crucial leukocyte adhesion molecule in both preterm and term infants.
