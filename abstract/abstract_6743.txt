BACKGROUND
pathogenic yersiniae, including y. pestis, share a type iii secretion system  that is composed of a secretion machinery, a set of translocation proteins, a control system, and six yop effector proteins including ypka and yopj. the cyclic amp receptor protein , a global regulator, was recently found to regulate the laterally acquired genes  in y. pestis. the regulation of t3ss components by crp is unknown.


RESULTS
the syco, ypka and yopj genes constitute a single operon in y. pestis. crp specifically binds to the promoter-proximate region of syco, and represses the expression of the syco-ypka-yopj operon. a single crp-dependent promoter is employed for the syco-ypka-yopj operon, but two crp binding sites  are detected within the promoter region. a crp box homologue is found in site  <dig> other than site  <dig>  the determination of crp-binding sites, transcription start site and core promoter element  promotes us to depict the structural organization of crp-dependent promoter, giving a map of crp-promoter dna interaction for syco-ypka-yopj.


CONCLUSIONS
the syco-ypka-yopj operon is under the direct and negative regulation of crp in y. pestis. the syco-ypka-yopj promoter-proximate regions are extremely conserved in y. pestis, y. pseudotuberculosis and y. enterocolitica. therefore, data presented here can be generally applied to the above three pathogenic yersiniae.
