BACKGROUND
the molecular basis for neutrophil recognition of chemotactic peptides is their binding to specific g-protein-coupled cell surface receptors . human neutrophils express two pattern recognition gpcrs, fpr <dig> and fpr <dig>  which belong to the family of formyl peptide receptors. the high degree of homology between these two receptors suggests that they share many functional and signal transduction properties, although they exhibit some differences with respect to signaling. the aims of this study were to determine whether fpr <dig> triggers a unique signal that allows direct influx of extracellular calcium without the emptying of intracellular calcium stores, and whether the gelsolin-derived pip2-binding peptide, pbp <dig>  selectively inhibits fpr2-mediated transient rise in intracellular ca2+.


RESULTS
the transient rise in intracellular ca2+ induced by agonists for fpr <dig> or fpr <dig> in human neutrophils occurred also in the presence of a chelator of ca2+ . pbp <dig> inhibited not only fpr2-induced oxidase activity, but also the transient rise in intracellular ca2+.


CONCLUSIONS
ca2+ signaling mediated via fpr <dig> follows the same route as fpr <dig>  which involves initial emptying of the intracellular stores. pbp <dig> inhibits selectively the signals generated by fpr <dig>  both with respect to nadph-oxidase activity and the transient rise in intracellular ca2+ induced by agonist exposure.
