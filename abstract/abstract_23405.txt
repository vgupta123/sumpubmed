BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  is the most common serovar in both human infections and farm animals in australia and many other countries. typhimurium is a broad host range serovar but has also evolved into host-adapted variants . six typhimurium strains of different phage types  were analysed using illumina high-throughput genome sequencing.


RESULTS
variations between strains were mainly due to single nucleotide polymorphisms  with an average of  <dig> snps per strain, ranging from  <dig> snps to  <dig> snps. there were seven insertions/deletions  involving whole or partial gene deletions, four inactivation events due to is <dig> insertion and  <dig> pseudogenes due to early termination. four of these inactivated or deleted genes may be virulence related. nine prophage or prophage remnants were identified in the six strains. gifsy- <dig>  gifsy- <dig> and the sope <dig> and ssph <dig> phage remnants were present in all six genomes while fels- <dig>  fels- <dig>  st64b, st <dig> and cp4- <dig> were variably present. four strains carried the 90-kb plasmid pslt which contains several known virulence genes. however, two strains were found to lack the plasmid. in addition, one strain had a novel plasmid similar to typhi strain ct <dig> plasmid phcm <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the genome data suggest that variations between strains were mainly due to accumulation of snps, some of which resulted in gene inactivation. unique genetic elements that were common between host-adapted phage types were not found. this study advanced our understanding on the evolution and adaptation of typhimurium at genomic level.
