BACKGROUND
conceptual parallels exist between bacterial and eukaryotic small-rna  pathways, yet relatively little is known about which protein may recognize and recruit bacterial srnas to interact with targets. in eukaryotes, argonaute  proteins discharge such functions. the highly conserved bacterial ybey rnase has structural similarities to the mid domain of agos. a limited study had indicated that in sinorhizobium meliloti the ybey ortholog regulates the accumulation of srnas as well as the target mrnas, raising the possibility that ybey may play a previously unrecognized role in bacterial srna regulation.


RESULTS
we have applied a multipronged approach of loss-of-function studies, genome-wide mrna and srna expression profiling, pathway analysis, target prediction, literature mining and network analysis to unravel ybey-dependent molecular responses of e. coli exposed to hydroxyurea . loss of ybey function, which results in a marked resistance to hu, had global affects on srna-mediated gene expression. of  <dig> detectable e. coli srnas in our microarray analysis,  <dig> srnas showed a differential expression upon hu stress, of which  <dig> srnas displayed a ybey-dependent change in expression. these included  <dig> hfq-dependent and  <dig> hfq-independent srnas. we successfully identified at least  <dig> experimentally inferred srna-mrna relationships. further applying a ‘context likelihood of relatedness’ algorithm, we reverse engineered the ybey-dependent hfq-dependent srna-mrna network as well as ybey-dependent hfq-independent srna-mrna network.


CONCLUSIONS
ybey extensively modulates hfq-dependent and independent srna-mrna interactions. ybey-dependent srnas have central roles in modulating cellular response to hu stress.
