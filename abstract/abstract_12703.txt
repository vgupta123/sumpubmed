BACKGROUND
stem cell transplantation as therapy for hematological disorders is often hampered by severe graft-versus-host-disease. this may be reduced by umbilical cord blood transplantation, an effect that has been attributed to qualitative differences between neonatal and adult t cells. we compared levels of secreted proteins and cytokine mrna induced in cord blood leukocytes  and adult blood leukocytes  by various stimuli.


RESULTS
while interleukin- <dig>  levels were similar in cbl and abl, there was less induction of the th <dig> cytokine interferon-γ in cbl. production of the th <dig> cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> and the hematopoietic cytokine il- <dig> was much lower in cbl versus abl after t-cell receptor-mediated stimulation, whereas production of gm-csf was comparable in the  <dig> cell types. the lower levels of th <dig> and th <dig> cytokines were maintained in cbl during a 4-day time-course study, while after  <dig> hours il- <dig> and gm-csf reached in cbl levels similar to those in abl. for all cytokines except ifnγ, the ic <dig> values for inhibition by cyclosporin a were similar in abl and cbl. in contrast, there was less expression and activation of transcription factors in cbl. activation of nf-κb by tpa/ionomycin was detected in abl but not cbl. furthermore, there was less expression of the th subset-specific transcription factors t-bet and c-maf in cbl versus abl, whereas gata- <dig> expression was similar. expression of t-bet and c-maf correlated with expression of the th <dig> and th <dig> cytokines, respectively. time course experiments revealed that t-bet expression was stimulated in both cell types, whereas c-maf and gata- <dig> were induced only in abl.


CONCLUSIONS
the diminished capability of cbl to synthesize cytokines is probably due to decreased activation of nf-κb, whereas differences in th subsets are due to differences in regulation of th lineage-specific transcriptions factors. we propose that the reduced incidence and severity of gvhd after allogeneic transplantation of umbilical cb cells is due to lesser activation of specific transcription factors and a subsequent reduction in production of certain cytokines.
