BACKGROUND
cell therapy is a potential therapeutic approach for several neurodegenetative disease, including huntington disease . to evaluate the putative efficacy of cell therapy in hd, most studies have used excitotoxic animal models with only a few studies having been conducted in genetic animal models. genetically modified animals should provide a more accurate representation of human hd, as they emulate the genetic basis of its etiology.


RESULTS
in this study, we aimed to assess the therapeutic potential of a human striatal neural stem cell line  implanted in the r6/ <dig> transgenic mouse model of hd. as darpp- <dig> gabaergic output neurons are predominately lost in hd, stroc <dig> cells were also pre-differentiated using purmorphamine, a hedgehog agonist, to yield a greater number of darpp- <dig> cells. a bilateral injection of  <dig> x <dig> cells of either undifferentiated or pre-differentiated darpp- <dig> cells, however, did not affect outcome compared to a vehicle control injection. both survival and neuronal differentiation remained poor with a mean of only  <dig> and  <dig> cells surviving in the undifferentiated and differentiated conditions respectively. only a few cells expressed the neuronal marker fox <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
although the rapid brain atrophy and short life-span of the r6/ <dig> model constitute adverse conditions to detect potentially delayed treatment effects, significant technical hurdles, such as poor cell survival and differentiation, were also sub-optimal. further consideration of these aspects is therefore needed in more enduring transgenic hd models to provide a definite assessment of this cell line’s therapeutic relevance. however, a combination of treatments is likely needed to affect outcome in transgenic models of hd.
