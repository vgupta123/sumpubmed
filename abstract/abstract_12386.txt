BACKGROUND
construction of a reliable network remains the bottleneck for network-based protein function prediction. we built an artificial network model called protein overlap network  for the entire genome of yeast, fly, worm, and human, respectively. each node of the network represents a protein, and two proteins are connected if they share a domain according to interpro database.


RESULTS
the function of a protein can be predicted by counting the occurrence frequency of go  terms associated with domains of direct neighbors. the average success rate and coverage were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, for the test genomes, and were increased to  <dig> % and  <dig> % when a composite pon of the four species was used for the prediction. as a comparison, the success rate was  <dig> % in the random control procedure. we also made predictions with go term annotations of the second layer nodes using the composite network and obtained an impressive success rate  and coverage , even for small genomes. further improvement was achieved by statistical analysis of manually annotated go terms for each neighboring protein.


CONCLUSIONS
the pons are composed of dense modules accompanied by a few long distance connections. based on the pons, we developed multiple approaches effective for protein function prediction.
