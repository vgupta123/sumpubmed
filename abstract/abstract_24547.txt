BACKGROUND
the development, optimization and validation of protein modeling methods require efficient tools for structural comparison. frequently, a large number of models need to be compared with the target native structure. the main reason for the development of clusco software was to create a high-throughput tool for all-versus-all comparison, because calculating similarity matrix is the one of the bottlenecks in the protein modeling pipeline.


RESULTS
clusco is fast and easy-to-use software for high-throughput comparison of protein models with different similarity measures  and clustering of the comparison results with standard methods: k-means clustering or hierarchical agglomerative clustering.


CONCLUSIONS
the application was highly optimized and written in c/c++, including the code for parallel execution on cpu and gpu, which resulted in a significant speedup over similar clustering and scoring computation programs.
