BACKGROUND
toll-like receptor  <dig> , an important pattern recognition receptor, activates proinflammatory pathways in response to various pathogens. it has been reported in humans and chicken, but not in geese, an important waterfowl species in china. since some vaccines stimulate robust immune responsesl in chicken but not in geeeses we speculated that their immune systems are different.


RESULTS
in this study, we cloned the goose tlr2- <dig> gene using rapid amplification of cdna ends and showed that geese tlr2- <dig> encoded a 793-amino-acid protein, containing a signal secretion peptide, an extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain, a transmembrane domain and a toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor signaling domain deduced from amino acid sequence. tlr2- <dig> shared  <dig> %– <dig> % homology with its homologues in other species. tissue expression of geese tlr2- <dig> varied markedly, and was higher in kidney, cloacal bursa, skin and brain compared to other organs/tissues. hek <dig> cells transfected with plasmids carrying goose tlr2- <dig> and nf-κb-luciferase responded significantly to stimulation with mycoplasma fermentans lipopeptide. furthermore, geese infected with mycoplasma gallisepticum  and salmonella enteritidis  showed significant upregulation of tlr2- <dig> in both in vivo and in vitro.


CONCLUSIONS
geese tlr2- <dig> is a functional homologue of tlr <dig> present in other species and plays an important role in bacterial recognition in geese.
