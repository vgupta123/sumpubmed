BACKGROUND
the exploitation of the surface display system of food and commensal lactic acid bacteria  for bacterial, viral, or protozoan antigen delivery has received strong interest recently. the generally regarded as safe  status of the lactococcus lactis coupled with a non-recombinant strategy of in-trans surface display, provide a safe platform for therapeutic drug and vaccine development. however, production of therapeutic proteins fused with cell-wall anchoring motifs is predominantly limited to prokaryotic expression systems. this presents a major disadvantage in the surface display system particularly when glycosylation has been recently identified to significantly enhance epitope presentation. in this study, the glycosylated murine tyrosinase related protein- <dig>  with the ability to anchor onto the l. lactis cell wall was produced in suspension adapted chinese hamster ovary  cells by expressing trp- <dig> fused with cell wall anchoring lysm motif  at the c-terminus.


RESULTS
a total amount of 33 μg of partially purified trp-2-ca from ~ <dig>  g in wet weight of cho-s cells was purified by his-tag affinity chromatography. the purified trp-2-ca protein was shown to be n-glycosylated and successfully anchored to the l. lactis cell wall.


CONCLUSIONS
thus cell surface presentation of glycosylated mammalian antigens may now permit development of novel and inexpensive vaccine platforms.
