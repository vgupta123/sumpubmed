BACKGROUND
type a <dig> clostridium botulinum strains are a group of gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacteria that produce a genetically, biochemically, and biophysically indistinguishable  <dig> kd protein that causes botulism. the genomes of three type a <dig> c. botulinum strains have been sequenced and show a high degree of synteny. the purpose of this study was to characterize differences among these genomes and compare these differentiating features with two additional unsequenced strains used in previous studies.


RESULTS
several strategies were deployed in this report. first, university of massachusetts dartmouth laboratory hall strain  neurotoxin gene was amplified by pcr and sequenced; its sequence was aligned with the published atcc  <dig> sanger institute hall strain and allergan hall strain neurotoxin gene regions. sequence alignment showed that there was a synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism  in the region encoding the heavy chain between allergan strain and atcc  <dig> and umass strains. second, comparative genomic hybridization  demonstrated that the umass strain and a strain expected to be derived from atcc  <dig> in the centers for disease control and prevention  laboratory  differed in gene content compared to the atcc  <dig> genome sequence published by the sanger institute. third, alignment of the three sequenced c. botulinum type a <dig> strain genomes revealed the presence of four comparable blocks. strains atcc  <dig> and atcc  <dig> share the same genome organization, while the organization of the blocks in strain hall were switched. lastly, pcr was designed to identify umass and atcc 3502* strain genome organizations. the pcr results indicated that umass strain belonged to hall type and atcc 3502* strain was identical to atcc  <dig>  type.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, c. botulinum type a <dig> strains including sanger institute atcc  <dig>  atcc 3502*, atcc  <dig>  hall, allergan, and umass strains demonstrate differences at the level of the neurotoxin gene sequence, in gene content, and in genome arrangement.
