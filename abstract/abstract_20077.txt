BACKGROUND
methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci  are of increasing importance to animal and public health. in veterinary medicine and along the meat and milk production line, only limited data were so far available on mr-cns characteristics. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of mr-cns, to identify the detected staphylococci to species level, and to assess the antibiotic resistance profiles of isolated mr-cns strains.


RESULTS
after two-step enrichment and growth on chromogenic agar, mr-cns were detected in  <dig> % of samples from livestock and chicken carcasses,  <dig> % of samples from bulk tank milk and minced meat, and  <dig> % of human samples. using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry ,  <dig> selected mr-cns strains belonged to seven different species . s. sciuri and s. fleurettii thereby predominated in livestock, btm and minced meat samples, whereas s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus predominated in human samples. in addition to beta-lactam resistance, 33-49% of all  <dig> strains were resistant to certain non-beta-lactam antibiotics .


CONCLUSIONS
a high prevalence of mr-cns was found in livestock production. this is of concern in view of potential spread of meca to s. aureus . multiresistant cns strains might become an emerging problem for veterinary medicine. for species identification of mr-cns isolated from different origins, maldi-tof ms proved to be a fast and reliable tool and is suitable for screening of large sample amounts.
