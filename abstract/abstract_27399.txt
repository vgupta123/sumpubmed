BACKGROUND

candida krusei has been known to exhibit communal interactions such as pellicle formation and crawling out of nutritional broth. we noticed another possible interaction on agar surfaces, where c. krusei yeast cells formed mycelia along agar surfaces toward each other. we report here the results of experiments to study this interaction.


RESULTS
when c.krusei yeast cells are plated in parallel streaks, they form mycelia along agar surfaces toward other yeasts. they also detect the presence of candida albicans and candida glabrata across agar surfaces, while the latter two react neither to their own kind, nor to c. krusei. secreted molecule are likely involved as c.krusei does not react to heat killed c. krusei. timing and rate of mycelia formation across distances suggests that mycelia start forming when a secreted molecule on agar surface reaches a certain concentration. we detected farnesol, tyrosol and tryptophol molecules that may be involved with mycelial formation, on the agar surfaces between yeast streaks. unexpectedly the amounts detected between streaks were significantly higher than would have expected from additive amounts of two streaks. all three candida species secreted these molecules. when tested on agar surface however, none of these molecules individually or combined induced mycelia formation by c. krusei.


CONCLUSIONS
our data confirms another communal interaction by c. krusei, manifested by formation of mycelia by yeast cells toward their own kind and other yeasts on agar surfaces. we detected secretion of farnesol, tyrosol and tryptophol by c. krusei but none of these molecules induced this activity on agar surface making it unlikely that they are the ones utilized by this yeast for this activity.
