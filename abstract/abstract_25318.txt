BACKGROUND
it is well known that in the rhizosphere soluble fe sources available for plants are mainly represented by a mixture of complexes between the micronutrient and organic ligands such as carboxylates and phytosiderophores  released by roots, as well as fractions of humified organic matter. the use by roots of these three natural fe sources  have been already studied at physiological level but the knowledge about the transcriptomic aspects is still lacking.


RESULTS
the 59fe concentration recorded after 24 h in tissues of tomato fe-deficient plants supplied with 59fe complexed to wehs reached values about  <dig> times higher than those measured in response to the supply with fe-citrate and fe-ps. however, after 1 h no differences among the three fe-chelates were observed considering the 59fe concentration and the root fe reduction activity. a large-scale transcriptional analysis of root tissue after 1 h of fe supply showed that fe-wehs modulated only two transcripts leaving the transcriptome substantially identical to fe-deficient plants. on the other hand, fe-citrate and fe-ps affected  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts, respectively, having  <dig> a similar transcriptional behaviour in response to both fe sources.


CONCLUSIONS
the root transcriptional response to the fe supply depends on the nature of chelating agents . the supply of fe-citrate and fe-ps showed not only a fast back regulation of molecular mechanisms modulated by fe deficiency but also specific responses due to the uptake of the chelating molecule. plants fed with fe-wehs did not show relevant changes in the root transcriptome with respect to the fe-deficient plants, indicating that roots did not sense the restored cellular fe accumulation.
