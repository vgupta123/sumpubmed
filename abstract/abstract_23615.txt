BACKGROUND
autonomously replicating sequences  in s. cerevisiae serve as origins of dna replication or as components of cis-acting silencers, which impose positional repression at the mating type loci and at the telomeres. both types of ars can act as replicators or silencers, however it is not clear how these quite diverse functions are executed. it is believed that all ars contain a core module of an essential ars consensus sequence  and a non-essential b <dig> element.


RESULTS
we have tested how the b <dig> elements contribute to the silencer and replicator function of ars. we report that the acs-b <dig> orientation of ars has a profound effect on the levels of gene silencing at telomeres. we also report that the destruction of the canonical b <dig> elements in two silencer ars  has no effect on their silencer and replicator activity.


CONCLUSIONS
the observed orientation effects on gene silencing suggest that arss can act as both proto-silencers and as insulator elements. in addition, the lack of b <dig> suggests that the acs-b <dig> module could be different in silencer and replicator ars.
