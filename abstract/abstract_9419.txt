BACKGROUND
effective therapies for transitional cell carcinoma  are limited, with objective response rates to most chemotherapeutic regimens below 20%. the purpose of this study was to investigate the biologic activity of combined toceranib phosphate and vinblastine chemotherapy for treatment of tcc. a secondary objective was to compare the utility of computed tomography  and abdominal ultrasound  in tumor response assessments.


RESULTS
dogs with tcc received vinblastine at  <dig>  mg/m <dig> every 2 weeks and toceranib at  <dig> – <dig>  mg/kg on monday/wednesday/friday. tumor monitoring was achieved through ct and aus. five patients completed the 16-week study. based on aus assessments,  <dig> dogs experienced biologic response to therapy including partial responses  and stable disease . based on ct,  <dig> dogs experienced a biologic response . both imaging modalities  were found to provide repeatable measurements between operators, however agreement between operator measurements was greater when ct images were used to assess tumor size.


CONCLUSIONS
the combination of toceranib and vinblastine did not result in improved response rates. while agreement in tumor volume assessments between both aus and ct were excellent between operators, this did not extend to assessment of tumor response. the higher rate of concordance between operators when assessing response to treatment with ct suggests that ct should be considered for future clinical trials involving canine bladder tcc to improve the accuracy and repeatability of tumor measurement. the data suggest that response to therapy as assessed by aus or ct do not predict duration of clinical response.
