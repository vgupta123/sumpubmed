BACKGROUND
to investigate the roles of androgen receptor  in epithelial- mesenchymal transition  in human prostate cancer stem progenitor  cells isolated from lncap cell line.

methods
the s/p cells were obtained from lncap cell line through florescence-activated cell sorting . ar was overexpressed in s/p cells through lentivirus. western blot assay was used to detect the emt markers expression, such as e cadherin, n cadherin, vimentin and snail. mtt assay, soft agar colony formation assay, sphere formation assay and migration assay were used to investigate ar’s roles in emt of s/p cells. cell signaling pathways associated with proliferation and apoptosis of s/p cells were detected simultaneously. and s/p cells were treated with in vitro combinatory use of ly  <dig>  with γ-tt and/or 5-aza.


RESULTS
our data showed that s/p cells from lncap had high emt markers expression, more tumorigenesis and strong migration ability. and in s/p cells overexpressed with ar, the expression of emt markers decreased. in addition, these cells had less proliferation ability, tumorigenesis ability, self-renewal and migration ability. at the same time, targeting s/p cells with akt signaling pathway inhibitor ly <dig> andγ-tt and/or 5-aza could inhibit s/p cell’s proliferation and tumorigenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that ar played a negative role in emt of pca s/p cells, by regulating akt cell signaling pathway, which could be a new strategy to treat castration resistant prostate cancer .
