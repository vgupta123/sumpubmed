BACKGROUND
soybean is one of the most important crops, providing large amounts of dietary proteins and edible oil, and is also an excellent model for studying evolution of duplicated genes. however, relative to the model plants arabidopsis and rice, the present knowledge about soybean transcriptome is quite limited.


RESULTS
in this study, we employed rna-seq to investigate transcriptomes of  <dig> soybean tissues, for genome-wide discovery of truly expressed genes, and novel and alternative transcripts, as well as analyses of conservation and divergence of duplicated genes and their functional implications. we detected a total of  <dig>  high-confidence expressed genes, and identified  <dig>  novel transcriptional regions with a mean length of 372Â bp. we also provided strong evidence for alternative splicing  events for ~ <dig> % of the genes with two or more exons. among them,  <dig>  genes exhibited stage-dependent as, and  <dig> genes had tissue-biased exon-skipping events. we further defined the conservation and divergence in expression patterns between duplicated gene pairs from recent whole genome duplications ; differentially expressed genes, tissue preferentially expressed genes, transcription factors and specific gene family members were identified for shoot apical meristem and flower development.


CONCLUSIONS
our results significantly improved soybean gene annotation, and also provide valuable resources for functional genomics and studies of the evolution of duplicated genes from wgds in soybean.
