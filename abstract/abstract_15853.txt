BACKGROUND
transmembrane receptor kinases play critical roles in both animal and plant signaling pathways regulating growth, development, differentiation, cell death, and pathogenic defense responses. in arabidopsis thaliana, there are at least  <dig> leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases , representing one of the largest protein families. although functional roles for a handful of lrr-rlks have been revealed, the functions of the majority of members in this protein family have not been elucidated.


RESULTS
as a resource for the in-depth analysis of this important protein family, the complementary dna sequences  of  <dig> lrr-rlks were cloned into the gatewayr donor vector pdonr/zeor and analyzed by dna sequencing. among them,  <dig> clones showed sequences identical to the predictions in the arabidopsis sequence resource, tair <dig>  the other  <dig> cdnas showed gene structures distinct from the predictions of tair <dig>  which was mainly caused by alternative splicing of pre-mrna. most of the genes have been further cloned into gatewayr destination vectors with gfp or flag epitope tags and have been transformed into arabidopsis for in planta functional analysis. all clones from this study have been submitted to the arabidopsis biological resource center  at ohio state university for full accessibility by the arabidopsis research community.


CONCLUSIONS
most of the arabidopsis lrr-rlk genes have been isolated and the sequence analysis showed a number of alternatively spliced variants. the generated resources, including cdna entry clones, expression constructs and transgenic plants, will facilitate further functional analysis of the members of this important gene family.
