BACKGROUND
yersinia enterocolitica strains responsible for mild gastroenteritis in humans are very diverse with respect to their metabolic and virulence properties. strain w <dig>  was recently identified to possess nematocidal and insecticidal activity. to better understand the relationship between pathogenicity towards insects and humans, we compared the w <dig> genome with that of the highly pathogenic strain  <dig> , the only y. enterocolitica strain sequenced so far.


RESULTS
we used whole-genome shotgun data to assemble, annotate and analyse the sequence of strain w <dig>  numerous factors assumed to contribute to enteric survival and pathogenesis, among them osmoregulated periplasmic glucan, hydrogenases, cobalamin-dependent pathways, iron uptake systems and the yersinia genome island  <dig>  involved in tight adherence were identified to be common to the  <dig> and w <dig> genomes. however, sets of ~ <dig> genes revealed to be specific for each of them in comparison to the other strain. the plasticity zone  of  <dig> kb in the w <dig> genome carries an ancient flagellar cluster flg- <dig> of ~ <dig> kb, but it lacks the pathogenicity island yapiye, the secretion system ysa and yts <dig>  and other virulence determinants of the  <dig> pz. its composition underlines the prominent variability of this genome region and demonstrates its contribution to the higher pathogenicity of biotype 1b strains with respect to w <dig>  a novel type three secretion system of mosaic structure was found in the genome of w <dig> that is absent in the sequenced strains of the human pathogenic yersinia species, but conserved in the genomes of the apathogenic species. we identified several regions of differences in w <dig> that mainly code for transporters, regulators, metabolic pathways, and defence factors.


CONCLUSIONS
the w <dig> sequence analysis revealed a genome composition distinct from other pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica strains, thus contributing novel data to the y. enterocolitica pan-genome. this study also sheds further light on the strategies of this pathogen to cope with its environments.
