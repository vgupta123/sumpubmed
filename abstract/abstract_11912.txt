BACKGROUND
although current molecular clock methods offer greater flexibility in modelling evolutionary events, calibration of the clock with dates from the fossil record is still problematic for many groups. here we implement several new approaches in molecular dating to estimate the evolutionary ages of lacertidae, an old world family of lizards with a poor fossil record and uncertain phylogeny. four different models of rate variation are tested in a new program for bayesian phylogenetic analysis called treetime, based on a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences. we incorporate paleontological uncertainty into divergence estimates by expressing multiple calibration dates as a range of probabilistic distributions. we also test the reliability of our proposed calibrations by exploring effects of individual priors on posterior estimates.


RESULTS
according to the most reliable model, as indicated by bayes factor comparison, modern lacertids arose shortly after the k/t transition and entered africa about  <dig> million years ago, with the majority of their african radiation occurring in the eocene and oligocene. our findings indicate much earlier origins for these clades than previously reported, and we discuss our results in light of paleogeographic trends during the cenozoic.


CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the first attempt to estimate evolutionary ages of a specific group of reptiles exhibiting uncertain phylogenetic relationships, molecular rate variation and a poor fossil record. our results emphasize the sensitivity of molecular divergence dates to fossil calibrations, and support the use of combined molecular data sets and multiple, well-spaced dates from the fossil record as minimum node constraints. the bioinformatics program used here, treetime, is publicly available, and we recommend its use for molecular dating of taxa faced with similar challenges.
