BACKGROUND
we present here an extensive epigenetic analysis of a  <dig> kb region, which encompasses the human desmin gene  and its 5' locus control region , the only muscle-specific transcriptional regulatory element of this type described to date. these data complement and extend encyclopaedia of dna elements  studies on region enr <dig>  we analysed histone modifications and underlying dna methylation patterns in physiologically relevant des expressing  and non-expressing  primary human cells.


RESULTS
we found that in expressing myoblast/myotube but not peripheral blood mononuclear cell  cultures, histone h <dig> acetylation displays a broadly distributed enrichment across a gene rich  <dig> kb region whereas h <dig> acetylation localizes at the transcriptional start site  of genes. we show that the des lcr and tss of des are enriched with hyperacetylated domains of acetylated histone h <dig>  with h <dig> lysine  <dig> di- and tri-methylation  exhibiting a different distribution pattern across this locus. the cpg island that extends into the first intron of des is methylation-free regardless of the gene's expression status and in non-expressing pbmcs is marked with histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> tri-methylation .


CONCLUSIONS
overall, our results constitute the first study correlating patterns of histone modifications and underlying dna methylation of a muscle-specific lcr and its associated downstream gene region whilst additionally placing this within a much broader genomic context. our results clearly show that there are distinct patterns of histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation and h <dig> methylation at the des lcr, promoter and intragenic region. in addition, the presence of h3k27me <dig> at the des methylation-free cpg only in non-expressing pbmcs may serve to silence this gene in non-muscle tissues. generally, our work demonstrates the importance of using multiple, physiologically relevant tissue types that represent different expressing/non-expressing states when investigating epigenetic marks and that underlying dna methylation status should be correlated with histone modification patterns when studying chromatin structure.
