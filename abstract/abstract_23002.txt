BACKGROUND
infectious cdna clones are a prerequisite for directed genetic manipulation of rna viruses. here, a strategy to facilitate manipulation and rescue of classical swine fever viruses  from full-length cdnas present within bacterial artificial chromosomes  is described. this strategy allows manipulation of viral cdna by targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis within bacteria.


RESULTS
a new csfv-bac  derived from the riems vaccine strain has been constructed and subsequently modified in the e <dig> coding sequence, using the targeted recombination strategy to enable rescue of chimeric pestiviruses  with potential as new marker vaccine candidates. sequencing of the bacs revealed a high genetic stability during passages within bacteria. the complete genome sequences of rescued viruses, after extensive passages in mammalian cells showed that modifications in the e <dig> protein coding sequence were stably maintained. a single amino acid substitution  in the rna dependent rna polymerase was observed in the rescued viruses vr26_e2gif and vr <dig>  which was reversion to the parental riems sequence.


CONCLUSIONS
these results show that targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis provides a powerful tool for expediting the construction of novel rna genomes and should be applicable to the manipulation of other rna viruses.
