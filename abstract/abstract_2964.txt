BACKGROUND
comparative genomics of the early diverging metazoan lineages and of their unicellular sister-groups opens new window to reconstructing the genetic changes which preceded or accompanied the evolution of multicellular body plans. a recent analysis found that the genome of the nerve-less sponges encodes the homologues of most vertebrate post-synaptic proteins. in vertebrate excitatory synapses, these proteins assemble to form the post-synaptic density, a complex molecular platform linking membrane receptors, components of their signalling pathways, and the cytoskeleton. newly available genomes from monosiga brevicollis  and trichoplax adhaerens  offer an opportunity to refine our understanding of post-synaptic protein evolution.


RESULTS
searches for orthologous proteins and reconstruction of gene gains/losses based on the taxon phylogeny indicate that post-synaptic proteins originated in two main steps. the backbone scaffold proteins  and some of their partners were acquired in a unicellular ancestor of choanoflagellates and metazoans. a substantial additional set appeared in an exclusive ancestor of the metazoa. the placozoan genome contains most post-synaptic genes but lacks some of them. notably, the master-scaffold protein shank might have been lost secondarily in the placozoan lineage.


CONCLUSIONS
the time of origination of most post-synaptic proteins was not concomitant with the acquisition of synapses or neural-like cells. the backbone of the scaffold emerged in a unicellular context and was probably not involved in cell-cell communication. based on the reconstructed protein composition and potential interactions, its ancestral function could have been to link calcium signalling and cytoskeleton regulation. the complex later became integrated into the evolving synapse through the addition of novel functionalities.
