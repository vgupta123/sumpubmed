BACKGROUND
to derive post-genomic, neutral insight into the peptidoglycan  distribution among organisms, we mined  <dig>  genomes listed in the carbohydrate-active enzymes database for the presence of a minimal 3-gene set that is necessary for pg metabolism. this gene set consists of one gene from the glycosyltransferase family gt <dig>  one from family gt <dig> and at least one gene belonging to one of five glycoside hydrolase families .


RESULTS
none of the  <dig> viruses or  <dig> archaea examined possessed the minimal 3-gene set, but this set was detected in 1/ <dig> of the eukarya members  and in  <dig> / <dig>   of bacteria, with a 100% positive predictive value for the presence of pg. pearson correlation test showed that gt <dig> family genes were significantly associated with pg with a value of  <dig>  and a p value less than 10- <dig>  this result was confirmed by a phylogenetic comparative analysis showing that the gt51-encoding gene was significantly associated with pg with a pagelâ€™s score of  <dig> and  <dig> . phylogenetic analysis indicated that the gt <dig> gene history comprised eight loss and one gain events, and suggested a dynamic on-going process.


CONCLUSIONS
genome analysis is a neutral approach to explore prospectively the presence of pg in uncultured, sequenced organisms with high predictive values.
