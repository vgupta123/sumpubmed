BACKGROUND
intracranial pediatric germ cell tumors  are rare and heterogeneous neoplasms and vary in histological differentiation, prognosis and clinical behavior. germinoma and mature teratoma are gcts that have a good prognosis, while other types of gcts, termed nongerminomatous malignant germ cell tumors , are tumors with an intermediate or poor prognosis. the second group of tumors requires more extensive drug and irradiation treatment regimens. the mechanisms underlying the differences in incidence and prognosis of the various gct subgroups are unclear.


RESULTS
we identified a distinct mrna profile correlating with gct histological differentiation and prognosis, and also present in this study the first mirna profile of pediatric primary intracranial gcts. most of the differentially expressed mirnas were downregulated in germinomas, but mir-142-5p and mir-146a were upregulated. genes responsible for self-renewal , nanog and klf4) and the immune response were abundant in germinomas, while genes associated with neuron differentiation, wnt/Î²-catenin pathway, invasiveness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition  and twist2) were abundant in ngmgcts. clear transcriptome segregation based on patient survival was observed, with malignant ngmgcts being closest to embryonic stem cells. chromosome copy number variations  at cytobands 4q <dig> -4q <dig>  and 9p <dig> -9q <dig> correlated with gct malignancy and clinical risk. six genes  within 4q <dig> -4q <dig>  were more abundant in germinomas.


CONCLUSIONS
our results integrate molecular profiles with clinical observations and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms causing gct malignancy. the genes, pathways and micrornas identified have the potential to be novel therapeutic targets.
