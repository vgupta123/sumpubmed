BACKGROUND
thanks to recent high coverage mass-spectrometry studies and reconstructed protein complexes, we are now in an unprecedented position to study the evolution of biological systems. gene duplications, known to be a major source of innovation in evolution, can now be readily examined in the context of protein complexes.


RESULTS
we observe that paralogs operating in the same complex fulfill different roles: mrna dosage increase for more than a hundred cytosolic ribosomal proteins, mutually exclusive participation of at least  <dig> paralogs resulting in alternative forms of complexes, and  <dig> proteins contributing to bona fide structural growth. inspection of paralogous proteins participating in two independent complexes shows that an ancient, pre-duplication protein functioned in both multi-protein assemblies and a gene duplication event allowed the respective copies to specialize and split their roles.


CONCLUSIONS
variants with conditionally assembled, paralogous subunits likely have played a role in yeast's adaptation to anaerobic conditions. in a number of cases the gene duplication has given rise to one duplicate that is no longer part of a protein complex and shows an accelerated rate of evolution. such genes could provide the raw material for the evolution of new functions.
