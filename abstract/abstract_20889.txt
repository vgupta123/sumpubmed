BACKGROUND
this study was carried out to investigate the status of brucellosis in cattle under various management systems in adamawa, kaduna and kano states, northern nigeria. using multi-stage sampling, serum samples of  <dig>  cattle from  <dig> herds were tested using the rose-bengal plate-agglutination test  and positives were confirmed using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .


RESULTS
prevalence estimates were calculated by adjusting for sampling weights and where possible for test sensitivity and specificity. thirty-seven percent of all animals were rbpt positive, and after confirmation with c-elisa the overall animal-level prevalence, adjusted for sampling weights, was  <dig> % . of the herds sampled,  <dig>  had at least one animal positive to both tests; this did not differ significantly between states . mean within-herd seroprevalence in positive herds was  <dig> %  and ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. overall animal-level seroprevalences of  <dig> %  n =  <dig> ,  <dig> %  n =  <dig>  and  <dig> %  n =  <dig>  were observed in adamawa, kaduna and kano states, respectively . a significantly higher seroprevalence was found in males  than in females   and in non-pregnant females  than in pregnant females  . seroprevalence increased with increasing age , from  <dig> %  in cattle < <dig> years to  <dig> %  in cattle > <dig> years. seroprevalence also varied between management systems : pastoral systems  <dig> % , zero-grazing systems  <dig> % , agro-pastoral systems  <dig> % , and commercial farms  <dig> % . seroprevalence did not differ significantly between breeds or lactation status.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first large study to assess the prevalence of bovine brucellosis over a wide geographic area of northern nigeria, in a variety of management systems and using accurate tests. the seroprevalence of brucellosis was high, and higher than results of previous studies in northern nigeria. the pastoral management systems of the traditional fulanis may be encouraging the dissemination of the disease. public enlightenment of the farmers about the disease, vaccination and appropriate national control measures are recommended.
