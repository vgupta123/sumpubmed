BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is a genetically diverse major human pathogen, yet a common colonizer of the nasopharynx. here we analyzed the influence of defects affecting in vitro growth rate, on the ability of s. pneumoniae to colonize and to cause invasive disease in vivo.


RESULTS
of eleven different clinical isolates one serotype  <dig> carrier isolate showed a significantly longer generation time as compared to other isolates, and was severely attenuated in mice. to directly investigate the impact of growth rate on virulence, a panel of mutants in five non-essential housekeeping genes was constructed in the virulent tigr <dig> background by insertion-deletion mutagenesis. three of these mutants  were, to different degrees, growth defective, and showed a reduced invasiveness in an intranasal murine challenge model that correlated to their in vitro growth rate, but remained capable of colonizing the upper airways. the growth defect, as well as virulence defect of the hemk insertion-deletion mutant, was mediated by polarity effects on the downstream yrdc gene, encoding a probable chaperone in ribosome assembly.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that large fitness defects are needed to completely prevent pneumococci from causing invasive disease after intranasal challenge. however, even severe growth defects still allow pneumococci to persistently colonize the upper airways.
