BACKGROUND
successful viral infection requires the involvement of host cellular factors in their life cycle. heat shock protein  <dig>  can be recruited by numerous viruses to promote the folding, maturation, or assembly of viral proteins. we have previously shown that hsp <dig> is significantly elevated in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus -infected lungs, suggesting hsp <dig> may play a potential role during prrsv infection. in this study, we tried to investigate the role of hsp <dig> during prrsv infection.


RESULTS
in this study, we observed that prrsv infection induced the expression of hsp <dig>  the down-regulation of hsp <dig> using quercetin, a hsps synthesis inhibitor, or small interfering rnas  reduced the viral protein level and viral production. notably, these inhibitory effects on prrsv infection could be attenuated by heat shock treatment. in addition, hsp <dig> was found to colocalize with the viral double-stranded rna  and knockdown of hsp <dig> decreased the dsrna levels, suggesting hsp <dig> is involved in the formation of viral replication and transcription complex  and thus affects the viral replication.


CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed that hsp <dig> is an essential host factor required for the replication of prrsv. the inhibition of hsp <dig> significantly reduced prrsv replication, which may be applied as an effective antiviral strategy.
