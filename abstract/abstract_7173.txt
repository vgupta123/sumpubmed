BACKGROUND
target genes of a transcription factor  pou5f <dig> , which is essential for pluripotency maintenance and self-renewal of embryonic stem  cells, have previously been identified based on their response to pou5f <dig> manipulation and occurrence of chromatin-immunoprecipitation -binding sites in promoters. however, many responding genes with binding sites may not be direct targets because response may be mediated by other genes and chip-binding site may not be functional in terms of transcription regulation.


RESULTS
to reduce the number of false positives, we propose to separate responding genes into groups according to direction, magnitude, and time of response, and to apply the false discovery rate  criterion to each group individually. using this novel algorithm with stringent statistical criteria  to a compendium of published and new microarray data  and published chip data, we identified  <dig> tentative target genes  for pou5f <dig>  the majority of ttgs  were down-regulated after pou5f <dig> suppression, indicating that the pou5f <dig> functions as an activator of gene expression when it binds to promoters. interestingly, many activated genes are potent suppressors of transcription, which include polycomb genes, zinc finger tfs, chromatin remodeling factors, and suppressors of signaling. similar analysis showed that sox <dig> and nanog also function mostly as transcription activators in cooperation with pou5f <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified the most reliable sets of direct target genes for key pluripotency genes â€“ pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog, and found that they predominantly function as activators of downstream gene expression. thus, most genes related to cell differentiation are suppressed indirectly.
