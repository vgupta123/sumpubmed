BACKGROUND
enterovirus  <dig>  is major cause of hand, foot and mouth disease. large epidemics of ev <dig> infection have been recently reported in the asian-pacific region. currently, no vaccine is available to prevent ev <dig> infection.


RESULTS
the peptide  consisting of the first  <dig> amino acids at the n-terminal of vp <dig> of ev <dig> genotype c <dig> were fused to hepatitis b core  protein. expression of fusion proteins in e. coli resulted in the formation of chimeric virus-like particles . mice immunized with the chimeric vlps elicited anti-vp4n <dig> antibody response. in vitro microneutralization experiments showed that anti-chimeric vlps sera were able to neutralize not only ev <dig> of genotype c <dig> but also ev <dig> of genotype a. neonatal mice model confirmed the neutralizing ability of anti-chimeric vlps sera. eiptope mapping led to the identification of a “core sequence” responsible for antibody recognition within the peptide.


CONCLUSIONS
immunization of chimeric vlps is able to elicit antibodies displaying a broad neutralizing activity against different genotypes of ev <dig> in vitro. the “core sequence” of ev71-vp <dig> is highly conserved across ev <dig> genotypes. the chimeric vlps have a great potential to be a novel vaccine candidate with a broad cross-protection against different ev <dig> genotypes.
