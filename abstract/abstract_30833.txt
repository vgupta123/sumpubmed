BACKGROUND
complex chronic diseases are usually not caused by changes in a single causal gene but by an unbalanced regulating network resulting from the dysfunctions of multiple genes or their products. therefore, network based systems approach can be helpful for the identification of candidate genes related to complex diseases and their relationships. axial spondyloarthropathy  is a group of chronic inflammatory joint diseases that mainly affect the spine and the sacroiliac joints. the pathogenesis of spa remains largely unknown.


RESULTS
in this paper, we conducted a network study of the pathogenesis of spa. we integrated data related to spa, from the omim database, proteomics and microarray experiments of spa, to prioritize spa candidate disease genes in the context of human protein interactome. based on the top ranked spa related genes, we constructed a spa specific ppi network, identified potential pathways associated with spa, and finally sketched an overview of biological processes involved in the development of spa.


CONCLUSIONS
the protein-protein interaction  network and pathways reflect the link between the two pathological processes of spa, i.e., immune mediated inflammation, as well as imbalanced bone modelling caused new boneformation and bone loss. we found that some known disease causative genes, such as tnfand ils, play pivotal roles in this interaction.
