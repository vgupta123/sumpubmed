BACKGROUND
in denmark and many other european countries, harvest records suggest a marked decline in european brown hare numbers, a decline often attributed to the agricultural practice. in the present study, we analyse the association between agricultural land-use, predator abundance and winter severity on the number of european brown hares harvested in denmark in the years  <dig> through  <dig> 


RESULTS
winter cereals had a significant negative association with european brown hare numbers. in contrast to this, root crop area was positively related to their numbers. remaining crop categories were not significantly associated with the european brown hare numbers, though grass out of rotation tended to be positively related. the areas of root crop production and of grass out of rotation have been reduced by approximately 80% and 50%, respectively, while the area of winter cereals has increased markedly . however, european brown hare numbers were primarily negatively associated with the number of red fox. finally, we also found a positive association between mild winters and european brown hare numbers.


CONCLUSIONS
the decline of danish european brown hare populations can mainly be attributed to predation by red fox, but the development in agricultural land-use during the last  <dig> years have also affected the european brown hare numbers negatively. additionally, though mild winters were beneficial to european brown hares, the increasing frequency of mild winters during the study period was insufficient to reverse the negative population trend.
