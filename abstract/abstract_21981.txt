BACKGROUND
a previous study identified a yersinia enterocolitica transposon mutant, gy <dig>  that was unable to export the flagellar type three secretion system -dependent phospholipase, ypla. this strain was also deficient for motility and unable to form colonies on lauria-bertani agar medium. preliminary analysis suggested it carried a mutation in csra. csra in escherichia coli is an rna-binding protein that is involved in specific post-transcriptional regulation of a myriad of physiological activities. this study investigated how csra affects expression of the flagellar regulatory cascade that controls ypla export and motility. it also explored the effect of csra mutation on y. enterocolitica in response to conditions that cue physiological changes important for growth in environments found both in nature and the laboratory.


RESULTS
the precise location of the transposon insertion in gmy <dig> was mapped within csra. genetic complementation restored disruptions in motility and the ypla export phenotype , which confirmed this mutation disrupted csra function. mutation of csra affected expression of ypla and flagellar genes involved in flagellar t3ss dependent export and motility by altering expression of the master regulators flhdc. mutation of csra also resulted in increased sensitivity of y. enterocolitica to various osmolytes, temperatures and antibiotics.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study reveal unique aspects of how csra functions in y. enterocolitica to control its physiology. this provides perspective on how the csr system is susceptible to adaptation to particular environments and bacterial lifestyles.
