BACKGROUND
removal of non-cellulosic impurities from cotton fabric, known as scouring, by conventional alkaline treatment causes environmental problems and reduces physical strength of fabrics. in this study, an endo-polygalacturonase  from aspergillus aculeatus produced in pichia pastoris was evaluated for its efficiency as a bioscouring agent while most current bioscouring process has been performed using crude pectinase preparation.


RESULTS
the recombinant endopg exhibited a specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg on citrus pectin under the optimal condition at 50 °c, ph  <dig>  with a vmax and km of  <dig> .35 μmol/min/ml and  <dig>  mg/ml, respectively. a maximal activity of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u/ml in the culture supernatant was obtained by high cell density batch fermentation, equivalent to a  <dig>  times greater yield than that from shake-flask culture. the recombinant enzyme was shown to be suitable for application as a bioscouring agent, in which the wettability of cotton fabric was increased by treatment with enzyme at  <dig> u/ml scouring solution at 40 °c, ph  <dig>  for 1 h. the bio-scoured fabric has comparable wettability to that obtained by conventional chemical scouring, but has higher tensile strength.


CONCLUSIONS
the work has demonstrated for the first time functions of a. aculeatus endopg on bioscouring in eco-textile processing. endopg alone was shown to possess effective scouring activity. high expression level and homogeneity could be achieved in bench-scale bioreactor.
