BACKGROUND
pluripotent cells maintain a unique gene expression pattern and specific chromatin signature. in this study, we explored the effect of the methyltransferase inhibitor adenosine dialdehyde  on pluripotency maintenance and gene expression in p <dig> embryonal carcinoma cells.


RESULTS
after adox treatment, the pluripotency-related gene network became disordered, and the early developmental genes were released from the repression. remarkably, adox caused contrasting effects on the expression of two key pluripotency genes, nanog and oct3/ <dig>  with the reduction of the repressive histone marks h3k27me <dig>  h3k9me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> only in the nanog gene.


CONCLUSIONS
key pluripotency genes were controlled by different mechanisms, including the differential enrichment of repressive histone methylation marks. these data provided novel clues regarding the critical role of histone methylation in the maintenance of pluripotency and the determination of cell fate in p <dig> pluripotent cells.
