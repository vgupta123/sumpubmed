BACKGROUND
protein acetylation is among the most common protein modifications. the two major types are post-translational nε-lysine acetylation catalyzed by kats  and co-translational nα-terminal acetylation catalyzed by nats . the major nat complex in yeast, nata, is composed of the catalytic subunit naa10p   and the auxiliary subunit naa15p . the nata complex potentially acetylates ser-, ala-, thr-, gly-, val- and cys- n-termini after met-cleavage. in humans, the homologues hnaa15p  and hnaa10p  were demonstrated to form a stable ribosome associated nat complex acetylating nata type n-termini in vitro and in vivo.


RESULTS
we here describe a novel human protein, hnaa16p , with 70% sequence identity to hnaa15p . the gene encoding hnaa16p originates from an early vertebrate duplication event from the common ancestor of hnaa <dig> and hnaa <dig>  immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry identified both endogenous hnaa15p and hnaa16p as distinct interaction partners of hnaa10p in hek <dig> cells, thus demonstrating the presence of both hnaa15p-hnaa10p and hnaa16p-hnaa10p complexes. the hnaa16p-hnaa10p complex acetylates nata type n-termini in vitro. hnaa16p is ribosome associated, supporting its potential role in cotranslational nα-terminal acetylation. hnaa <dig> is expressed in a variety of human cell lines, but is generally less abundant as compared to hnaa <dig>  specific knockdown of hnaa <dig> induces cell death, suggesting an essential role for hnaa16p in human cells.


CONCLUSIONS
at least two distinct nata protein nα-terminal acetyltransferases coexist in human cells potentially creating a more complex and flexible system for nα-terminal acetylation as compared to lower eukaryotes.
