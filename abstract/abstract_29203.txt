BACKGROUND
simulating protein folding motions is an important problem in computational biology. motion planning algorithms, such as probabilistic roadmap methods, have been successful in modeling the folding landscape. probabilistic roadmap methods and variants contain several phases . most of the time is spent in the connection phase and selecting which variant to employ is a difficult task. global machine learning has been applied to the connection phase but is inefficient in situations with varying topology, such as those typical of folding landscapes.


RESULTS
we develop a local learning algorithm that exploits the past performance of methods within the neighborhood of the current connection attempts as a basis for learning. it is sensitive not only to different types of landscapes but also to differing regions in the landscape itself, removing the need to explicitly partition the landscape. we perform experiments on  <dig> proteins of varying secondary structure makeup with 52– <dig> residues. we compare the success rate when using our methods and other methods. we demonstrate a clear need for learning  and show that local learning is superior to global learning producing, in many cases, significantly higher quality results than the other methods.


CONCLUSIONS
we present an algorithm that uses local learning to select appropriate connection methods in the context of roadmap construction for protein folding. our method removes the burden of deciding which method to use, leverages the strengths of the individual input methods, and it is extendable to include other future connection methods.
