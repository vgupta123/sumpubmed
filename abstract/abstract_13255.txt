BACKGROUND
h <dig> is a paternally imprinted gene that has been shown to be highly expressed in the trophoblast tissue. results from previous studies have initiated a debate as to whether noncoding rna h <dig> acts as a tumor suppressor or as a tumor promotor in trophoblast tissue. in the present study, we developed lentiviral vectors expressing h19-specific small interfering rna  to specifically block the expression of h <dig> in the human choriocarcinoma cell line jar. using this approach, we investigated the impact of the h <dig> gene on the proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of jar cells. moreover, we examined the effect of h <dig> knockdown on the expression of insulin-like growth factor  <dig> , hairy and enhancer of split homologue- <dig>  and dual-specific phosphatase  <dig>  genes.


RESULTS
h <dig> knockdown inhibited apoptosis and proliferation of jar cells, but had no significant impact on cell invasion. in addition, h <dig> knockdown resulted in significant upregulation of hes- <dig> and dusp <dig> expression, but not igf <dig> expression in jar cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the finding that h <dig> downregulation could simultaneously inhibit proliferation and apoptosis of jar cells highlights a putative dual function for h <dig> in choriocarcinoma and may explain the debate on whether h <dig> acts as a tumor suppressor or a tumor promotor in trophoblast tissue. furthermore, upregulation of hes- <dig> and dusp <dig> may mediate h <dig> downregulation-induced suppression of proliferation and apoptosis of jar cells.
