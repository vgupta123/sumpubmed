BACKGROUND
in recent years, substantial effort has been applied to de novo regulatory motif discovery. at this time, more than  <dig> software tools exist to detect regulatory binding sites given a set of genomic sequences. as the number of software packages increases, it becomes more important to identify the tools with the best performance characteristics for specific problem domains. identifying the correct tool is difficult because of the great variability in motif detection software. consequently, many labs spend considerable effort testing methods to find one that works well in their problem of interest.


RESULTS
in this work, we propose a method  that substantially reduces the effort required to assess de novo regulatory motif discovery software. mtap differs from previous attempts at regulatory motif assessment in that it automates motif discovery tool pipelines , automatically constructs orthologous upstream sequences, and provides automated benchmarks for many popular tools. as a proof of concept, we have run benchmarks over human, mouse, fly, yeast, e. coli and b. subtilis.


CONCLUSIONS
mtap presents a new approach to the challenging problem of assessing regulatory motif discovery methods. the most current version of mtap can be downloaded from
