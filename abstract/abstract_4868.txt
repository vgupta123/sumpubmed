BACKGROUND
typhimurium is the main serotype of salmonella enterica subsp. enterica implicated in food-borne diseases worldwide. this study aimed to detect the prevalence of ten markers combined in a macro-array based on multiplex real-time pcr. we targeted characteristic determinants located on pathogenicity islands ) as well as a specific 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer sequence of definitive type  <dig> . to investigate antimicrobial resistance, the study also targeted the presence of genes involved in sulfonamide  and beta-lactam  resistance. finally, the inti <dig> determinant encoding integrase from class  <dig> integron was also investigated.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> unrelated s. typhimurium strains isolated between  <dig> and  <dig> from various sources, including food animals, food products, human and environmental samples were studied. based on the combined presence or absence of these markers, we distinguished  <dig> different genotypes, including three major genotypes encountered in 75% of the studied strains, although spi determinants were almost always detected, sgi <dig>  inti <dig>  sul <dig> and blatem determinants were found 47%, 52%, 54% and 12% of the time respectively, varying according to isolation source. low-marker patterns were most often detected in poultry sources whereas full-marker patterns were observed in pig, cattle and human sources.


CONCLUSIONS
the genediscÂ® assay developed in this study madeit easier to explore variability within serotype typhimurium by analyzing ten relevant gene determinants in a large collection of strains. this real-time multiplex method constitutes a valuable tool for strains characterization on epidemiological purposes.
