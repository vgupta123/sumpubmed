BACKGROUND
the distributed annotation system  has proven to be a successful way to publish and share biological data. although there are more than  <dig> active registered servers from around  <dig> organizations, setting up a das server comprises a fair amount of work, making it difficult for many research groups to share their biological annotations. given the clear advantage that the generalized sharing of relevant biological data is for the research community it would be desirable to facilitate the sharing process.


RESULTS
here we present easydas, a web-based system enabling anyone to publish biological annotations with just some clicks. the system, available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/panda-srv/easydas is capable of reading different standard data file formats, process the data and create a new publicly available das source in a completely automated way. the created sources are hosted on the ebi systems and can take advantage of its high storage capacity and network connection, freeing the data provider from any network management work. easydas is an open source project under the gnu lgpl license.


CONCLUSIONS
easydas is an automated das source creation system which can help many researchers in sharing their biological data, potentially increasing the amount of relevant biological data available to the scientific community.
