BACKGROUND
minor alleles of the human dopamine receptor polymorphisms, drd2/taqi a and drd4/ <dig> bp, are related to decreased functioning and/or numbers of their respective receptors and have been shown to be correlated with body mass, height and food craving. in addition, the 7r minor allele of the drd <dig> gene is at a higher frequency in nomadic compared to sedentary populations. here we examine polymorphisms in the drd <dig> and drd <dig> genes with respect to body mass index  and height among men in two populations of ariaal pastoralists, one recently settled  and the other still nomadic . the ariaal live in northern kenya, are chronically undernourished and are divided socially among age-sets.


RESULTS
frequencies of the drd4/7r and drd2/a <dig> alleles were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively and did not differ between the nomadic and settled populations. bmi was higher in those with one or two drd4/7r alleles in the nomadic population, but lower among the settled. post-hoc analysis suggests that the drd <dig> differences in bmi were due primarily to differences in fat free body mass. height was unrelated to either drd2/taqi a or drd4/ <dig> bp genotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the drd4/7r allele may be more advantageous among nomadic than settled ariaal men. this result suggests that a selective advantage mediated through behaviour may be responsible for the higher frequency of the 7r alleles in nomadic relative to sedentary populations around the world. in contrast to previous work, we did not find an association between drd <dig> genotypes and height. our results support the idea that human phenotypic expression of genotypes should be rigorously evaluated in diverse environments and genetic backgrounds.
