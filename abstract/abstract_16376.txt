BACKGROUND
in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the immunosuppressant rapamycin engenders a profound modification in the transcriptional profile leading to growth arrest. mutants devoid of rrd <dig>  a protein possessing in vitro peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity, display striking resistance to the drug, although how rrd <dig> activity is linked to the biological responses has not been elucidated.


RESULTS
we now provide evidence that rrd <dig> is associated with the chromatin and it interacts with rna polymerase ii. circular dichroism revealed that rrd <dig> mediates structural changes onto the c-terminal domain  of the large subunit of rna polymerase ii  in response to rapamycin, although this appears to be independent of the overall phosphorylation status of the ctd. in vitro experiments, showed that recombinant rrd <dig> directly isomerizes purified gst-ctd and that it releases rna polymerase ii from the chromatin. consistent with this, we demonstrated that rrd <dig> is required to alter rna polymerase ii occupancy on rapamycin responsive genes.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose as a mechanism, that upon rapamycin exposure rrd <dig> isomerizes rpb <dig> to promote its dissociation from the chromatin in order to modulate transcription.
