BACKGROUND
the exploding growth of the biomedical literature presents many challenges for biological researchers. one such challenge is from the use of a great deal of abbreviations. extracting abbreviations and their definitions accurately is very helpful to biologists and also facilitates biomedical text analysis. existing approaches fall into four broad categories: rule based, machine learning based, text alignment based and statistically based. state of the art methods either focus exclusively on acronym-type abbreviations, or could not recognize rare abbreviations. we propose a systematic method to extract abbreviations effectively. at first a scoring method is used to classify the abbreviations into acronym-type and non-acronym-type abbreviations, and then their corresponding definitions are identified by two different methods: text alignment algorithm for the former, statistical method for the latter.


RESULTS
a literature mining system mba was constructed to extract both acronym-type and non-acronym-type abbreviations. an abbreviation-tagged literature corpus, called medstract gold standard corpus, was used to evaluate the system. mba achieved a recall of 88% at the precision of 91% on the medstract gold-standard evaluation corpus.


CONCLUSIONS
we present a new literature mining system mba for extracting biomedical abbreviations. our evaluation demonstrates that the mba system performs better than the others. it can identify the definition of not only acronym-type abbreviations including a little irregular acronym-type abbreviations , but also non-acronym-type abbreviations .
