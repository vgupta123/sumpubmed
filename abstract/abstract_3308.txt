BACKGROUND
information on the age structure within populations of an endangered species can facilitate effective management. the blue mountains water skink  is a viviparous scincid lizard that is restricted to <  <dig> isolated montane swamps in south-eastern australia. we used skeletochronology of phalanges  to estimate ages of  <dig> individuals from  <dig> populations.


RESULTS
these lizards grow rapidly, from neonatal size  to adult size  within two to three years. fecundity is low  and is affected by maternal body length and age. offspring quality may decline with maternal age, based upon captive-born neonates . in contrast to its broadly sympatric  congener e. tympanum, e. leuraensis is short-lived . litter size and offspring size are similar in the two species, but female e. leuraensis reproduce annually whereas many e. tympanum produce litters biennially. thus, a low survival rate  is the key reason why e. leuraensis is endangered. our  <dig> populations exhibited similar growth rates and population age structures despite substantial variation in elevation, geographic location and swamp size. however, larger populations  contained older lizards, and thus a wider variance in ages.


CONCLUSIONS
our study suggests that low adult survival rates, as well as specialisation on a rare and fragmented habitat type  contribute to the endangered status of the blue mountains water skink.
