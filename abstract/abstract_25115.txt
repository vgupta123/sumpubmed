BACKGROUND
snake venom composition varies widely both among closely related species and within the same species, based on ecological variables. in terrestrial snakes, such variation has been proposed to be due to snakes' diet. land snakes target various prey species including insects , lizards , frogs and toads , birds , and rodents , whereas sea snakes target a single vertebrate class  and often specialize on specific types of fish. it is therefore interesting to examine the evolution of toxins in sea snake venoms compared to that of land snakes.


RESULTS
here we describe the expression of toxin genes in the venom glands of two sea snakes, lapemis curtus  and acalyptophis peronii , two members of a large adaptive radiation which occupy very different ecological niches. we constructed cdna libraries from their venom glands and sequenced  <dig> and  <dig> clones, respectively. our data show that despite their explosive evolutionary radiation, there is very little variability in the three-finger toxin  as well as the phospholipase a <dig>  enzymes, the two main constituents of lapemis curtus and acalyptophis peronii venom. to understand the evolutionary trends among land snakes, sea snakes and sea kraits, pairwise genetic distances  of 3ftx and pla <dig> sequences were calculated. results show that these proteins appear to be highly conserved in sea snakes in contrast to land snakes or sea kraits, despite their extremely divergent and adaptive ecological radiation.


CONCLUSIONS
based on these results, we suggest that streamlining in habitat and diet in sea snakes has possibly kept their toxin genes conserved, suggesting the idea that prey composition and diet breadth may contribute to the diversity and evolution of venom components.
