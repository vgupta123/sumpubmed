BACKGROUND
up to 40% of hiv-infected individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy  have poor cd4+ t-cell recovery. the role of natural killer  cells in immune recovery during haart is not well understood. we described the profiles of nk cell subsets and their expression of activating receptor, nkg2d and cytotoxicity receptor nkp <dig> among suboptimal immune responders to despite four years of suppressive haart.

methods
a case control study utilized frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells  from a cohort of hiv-infected adults that initiated haart in 2004/ <dig>  at cd <dig> <  <dig> cells/μl. cases were ‘suboptimal’ responders; patients within the lowest quartile of cd4+ t-cell reconstitution, with a median cd <dig> count increase of  <dig>  cells/μl  and controls were ‘super-optimal’ responders; patients within the highest quartile of cd <dig> t-cell reconstitution with a median cd <dig> count increase of  <dig>  cells/μl). expression of nk cell lineage markers  and receptors nkg2d and nkp <dig>  was measured among pbmc from  <dig> cases of ‘suboptimal’ responders’ and  <dig> controls of ‘super-optimal responders’, and compared among ‘suboptimal’ and ‘super-optimal’ responders. nk cell populations were compared using the holm sidak multiple comparison test and p values <  <dig>  were considered statistically significant. data was analyzed using flowjo and graphpad prism  <dig> 


RESULTS
‘suboptimal responders’ had a higher proportion of cytokine producing cd56++cd16+/-  nk cells than the ‘super-optimal responders’ p =  <dig> , and cd56neg nk cells were lower among suboptimal than super-optimal responders . the largest nk cell subset, cd56dim, was comparable among suboptimal responders and ‘super-optimal immune responders’. expression of nkg2d and nkp <dig> receptors on nk cell subsets , was comparable among ‘suboptimal’ and ‘super-optimal’ immune responders.


CONCLUSIONS
the pro-inflammatory cd56++cd16-- nk cells were higher among ‘suboptimal’ responders relative to ‘super-optimal’ responders, despite four years of suppressive haart. alteration of nk cell populations could inhibit host immune responses to infections among suboptimal responders. we recommend further analysis of nk cell function among suboptimal immune responders in order to inform targeted interventions to optimize immune recovery among haart-treated adults.
