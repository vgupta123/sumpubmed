BACKGROUND
the proteins from the uba-ubx family interact with ubiquitylated proteins via their uba domain and with p <dig> via their ubx domain, thereby acting as substrate-binding adaptors for the p <dig> atpase. in particular, human ubxn <dig>  mediates p <dig> interaction with the transcription factor hif1α that is actively ubiquitylated in normoxic cells by a cul2-based e <dig> ligase, crl <dig>  mass spectrometry analysis of uba-ubx protein immunoprecipitates showed that they interact with a multitude of e <dig> ubiquitin-ligases. conspicuously, ubxn <dig> was most proficient in interacting with cullin-ring ligase subunits. we therefore set out to determine whether ubxn <dig> interaction with cullins was direct or mediated by its ubiquitylated targets bound to the uba domain.


RESULTS
we show that ubxn <dig> interaction with cullins is independent of ubiquitin- and substrate-binding. instead, it relies on the uim motif in ubxn <dig> that directly engages the nedd <dig> modification on cullins. to understand the functional consequences of ubxn <dig> interaction with neddylated cullins, we focused on hif1α, a cul <dig> substrate that uses ubxd7/p <dig> as a ubiquitin-receptor on its way to proteasome-mediated degradation. we find that ubxn <dig> over-expression converts cul <dig> to its neddylated form and causes the accumulation of non-ubiquitylated hif1α. both of these effects are strictly uim-dependent and occur only when ubxn <dig> contains an intact uim motif. we also show that hif1α carrying long ubiquitin-chains can recruit alternative ubiquitin-receptors, lacking p97's atp-dependent segregase activity.


CONCLUSIONS
our study shows that independently of its function as a ubiquitin-binding adaptor for p <dig>  ubxn <dig> directly interacts with neddylated cullins and causes the accumulation of the cul <dig> substrate hif1α. we propose that by sequestering cul <dig> in its neddylated form, ubxn <dig> negatively regulates the ubiquitin-ligase activity of crl <dig> and this might prevent recruitment of ubiquitin-receptors other than p <dig> to nuclear hif1α.
