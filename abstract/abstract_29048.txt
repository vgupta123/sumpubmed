BACKGROUND
whole exome capture sequencing allows researchers to cost-effectively sequence the coding regions of the genome. although the exome capture sequencing methods have become routine and well established, there is currently a lack of tools specialized for variant calling in this type of data.


RESULTS
using statistical models trained on validated whole-exome capture sequencing data, the atlas <dig> suite is an integrative variant analysis pipeline optimized for variant discovery on all three of the widely used next generation sequencing platforms . the suite employs logistic regression models in conjunction with user-adjustable cutoffs to accurately separate true snps and indels from sequencing and mapping errors with high sensitivity .


CONCLUSIONS
we have implemented the atlas <dig> suite and applied it to  <dig> whole exome samples from the  <dig> genomes project. the atlas <dig> suite is available for download at http://sourceforge.net/projects/atlas2/. in addition to a command line version, the suite has been integrated into the genboree workbench, allowing biomedical scientists with minimal informatics expertise to remotely call, view, and further analyze variants through a simple web interface. the existing genomic databases displayed via the genboree browser also streamline the process from variant discovery to functional genomics analysis, resulting in an off-the-shelf toolkit for the broader community.
