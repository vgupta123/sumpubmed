BACKGROUND
facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy  is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder associated with the partial deletion of integral numbers of  <dig>  kb d4z <dig> dna repeats within the subtelomere of chromosome 4q. a number of candidate fshd genes, adenine nucleotide translocator  <dig> gene , fshd-related gene  <dig> , frg <dig> and dux4c, upstream of the d4z <dig> array , and double homeobox chromosome  <dig>  within the repeat itself, are upregulated in some patients, thus suggesting an underlying perturbation of the chromatin structure. furthermore, a mouse model overexpressing frg <dig> has been generated, displaying skeletal muscle defects.


RESULTS
in the context of myogenic differentiation, we compared the chromatin structure and tridimensional interaction of the d4z <dig> array and frg <dig> gene promoter, and frg <dig> expression, in control and fshd cells. the frg <dig> gene was prematurely expressed during fshd myoblast differentiation, thus suggesting that the number of d4z <dig> repeats in the array may affect the correct timing of frg <dig> expression. using chromosome conformation capture  technology, we revealed that the frg <dig> promoter and d4z <dig> array physically interacted. furthermore, this chromatin structure underwent dynamic changes during myogenic differentiation that led to the loosening of the frg1/4q-d4z <dig> array loop in myotubes. the frg <dig> promoter in both normal and fshd myoblasts was characterized by h3k <dig> trimethylation and polycomb repressor complex binding, but these repression signs were replaced by h3k <dig> trimethylation during differentiation. the d4z <dig> sequences behaved similarly, with h3k <dig> trimethylation and polycomb binding being lost upon myogenic differentiation.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose a model in which the d4z <dig> array may play a critical chromatin function as an orchestrator of in cis chromatin loops, thus suggesting that this repeat may play a role in coordinating gene expression.
