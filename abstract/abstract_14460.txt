BACKGROUND
neoplasia can be driven by mutations resulting in dysregulation of transcription. in the mesenchymal neoplasm, aggressive fibromatosis, subtractive hybridization identified sterile alpha motif domain  <dig>  as a substantially down regulated gene in neoplasia. samd <dig> was recently found to be mutated in normophosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis. in this study, we studied the gene structure and function of samd <dig>  and its paralogous gene, samd9l, and examined these in a variety of species.


RESULTS
samd <dig> is located on human chromosome 7q <dig>  with a paralogous gene sterile alpha motif domain  <dig> like  in the head-to-tail orientation. although both genes are present in a variety of species, the orthologue for samd <dig> is lost in the mouse lineage due to a unique genomic rearrangement. both samd <dig> and samd9l are ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. samd <dig> is expressed at a lower level in a variety of neoplasms associated with Î²-catenin stabilization, such as aggressive fibromatosis, breast, and colon cancers. samd <dig> and samd9l contain an amino-terminal sam domain, but the remainder of the predicted protein structure does not exhibit substantial homology to other known protein motifs. the putative protein product of samd <dig> localizes to the cytoplasm. in vitro data shows that samd <dig> negatively regulates cell proliferation. over expression of samd <dig> in the colon cancer cell line, sw <dig>  reduces the volume of tumors formed when transplanted into immune-deficient mice.


CONCLUSIONS
samd <dig> and samd9l are a novel family of genes, which play a role regulating cell proliferation and suppressing the neoplastic phenotype. this is the first report as far as we know about a human gene that exists in rat, but is lost in mouse, due to a mouse specific rearrangement, resulting in the loss of the samd <dig> gene.
