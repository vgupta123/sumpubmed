BACKGROUND
the correct taxonomic assignment of bacterial genomes is a primary and challenging task. with the availability of whole genome sequences, the gene content based approaches appear promising in inferring the bacterial taxonomy. the complete genome sequencing of a bacterial genome often reveals a substantial number of unique genes present only in that genome which can be used for its taxonomic classification.


RESULTS
in this study, we have proposed a comprehensive method which uses the taxon-specific genes for the correct taxonomic assignment of existing and new bacterial genomes. the taxon-specific genes identified at each taxonomic rank have been successfully used for the taxonomic classification of  <dig>  genomes present in the ncbi genomes,  <dig> newly sequenced genomes, and  <dig> genomes for which the complete taxonomy is not yet known. this approach has been implemented for the development of a tool ‘microtaxi’ which can be used for the taxonomic assignment of complete bacterial genomes.


CONCLUSIONS
the taxon-specific gene based approach provides an alternate valuable methodology to carry out the taxonomic classification of newly sequenced or existing bacterial genomes.
