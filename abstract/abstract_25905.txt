BACKGROUND
identification of expression quantitative trait loci  is an emerging area in genomic study. the task requires an integrated analysis of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism  data and gene expression data, raising a new computational challenge due to the tremendous size of data.


RESULTS
we develop a method to identify eqtls. the method represents eqtls as information flux between genetic variants and transcripts. we use information theory to simultaneously interrogate snp and gene expression data, resulting in a transcriptional information map  which captures the network of transcriptional information that links genetic variations, gene expression and regulatory mechanisms. these maps are able to identify both cis- and trans- regulating eqtls. the application on a dataset of leukemia patients identifies eqtls in the regions of the gart, pcp <dig>  dscam, and ripk <dig> genes that regulate adamts <dig>  a known leukemia correlate.


CONCLUSIONS
the information theory approach presented in this paper is able to infer the dependence networks between snps and transcripts, which in turn can identify cis- and trans-eqtls. the application of our method to the leukemia study explains how genetic variants and gene expression are linked to leukemia.
