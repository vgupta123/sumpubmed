BACKGROUND
alloplasmic wheat lines with aegilops crassa cytoplasm often show homeotic conversion of stamens into pistils under long-day conditions. in the pistillody-exhibiting florets, an ectopic ovule is formed within the transformed stamens, and female sterility is also observed because of abnormal integument development.


RESULTS
in this study, four wheat bell1-like homeobox  genes were isolated and named wblh <dig> to wblh <dig>  wblh1/wblh3/wblh <dig> expression was observed in the basal boundary region of the ovary in both normal pistils and transformed stamens. wblh <dig> was also strongly expressed in integuments not only of normal ovules in pistils but also of the ectopic ovules in transformed stamens, and the wblh <dig> expression pattern in the sterile pistils seemed to be identical to that in normal ovules of fertile pistils. in addition, wblh <dig> and wblh <dig> showed interactions with the three wheat knox proteins through the bel domain. wblh <dig>  however, formed a complex with wheat knotted <dig> and rough sheath <dig> orthologs through sky and bel domains, but not with a wheat liguleless <dig> ortholog.


CONCLUSIONS
expression of the four wblh genes is evident in reproductive organs including pistils and transformed stamens and is independent from female sterility in alloplasmic wheat lines with ae. crassa cytoplasm. knox-blh interaction was conserved among various plant species, indicating the significance of knox-blh complex formation in wheat developmental processes. the functional features of wblh <dig> are likely to be distinct from other blh gene functions in wheat development.
