BACKGROUND
annexin v, a  <dig>  kda intracellular protein, is a ca+2- dependent phospholipid binding protein with high affinity to phosphatidylserine , which is a well-known hallmark of apoptosis. annexin v is a sensitive probe for ps exposure upon the cell membrane, and used for detection of apoptotic cells both in vivo and in vitro. large-scale production of recombinant human annexin v is worth optimization, because of its wide use in nuclear medicine, radiolabeled with 99mtc, for the evaluation of cancer chemotherapy treatments, and its use in identification of apoptotic cells in histologic studies. here we describe the high-yield production of a tag-free version of human annexin v recombinant protein by linear fed-batch cultivation in a bioreactor.


RESULTS
we cloned the human anxa <dig> coding sequence into the pet-30a  expression vector and expressed rhanxa <dig> in batch and fed-batch cultures. using e. coli bl <dig>  in a semi-defined medium at 37°c, ph  <dig> in fed-batch cultures, we obtained a 45-fold increase in biomass production, respective to shaker cultivations. we developed a single-step protocol for rhanxa <dig> purification using a strong anion-exchange column . using these procedures, we obtained  <dig>  mg of homogeneous, nontagged and biologically functional human annexin v recombinant protein from 3 g wet weight of bacterial cells from bioreactor cultures. the identity and molecular mass of rhanxa <dig> was confirmed by mass spectrometry. moreover, the purified rhanxa <dig> protein was functionally evaluated in a fitc-annexin v binding experiment and the results demonstrated that rhanxa <dig> detected apoptotic cells similarly to a commercial kit.


CONCLUSIONS
we describe a new fed-batch method to produce recombinant human annexin v in large scale, which may expand the commercial utilities for rhanxav to applications such as in vivo imaging studies.
