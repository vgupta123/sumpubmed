BACKGROUND
bos primigenius, the aurochs, is the wild ancestor of modern cattle breeds and was formerly widespread across eurasia and northern africa. after a progressive decline, the species became extinct in  <dig>  the origin of modern taurine breeds in europe is debated. archaeological and early genetic evidence point to a single near eastern origin and a subsequent spread during the diffusion of herding and farming. more recent genetic data are instead compatible with local domestication events or at least some level of local introgression from the aurochs. here we present the analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome of a pre-neolithic italian aurochs.


RESULTS
in this study, we applied a combined strategy employing both multiplex pcr amplifications and  <dig> pyrosequencing technology to sequence the complete mitochondrial genome of an  <dig> -year-old aurochs specimen from central italy. phylogenetic analysis of the aurochs mtdna genome supports the conclusions from previous studies of short mtdna fragments - namely that italian aurochsen were genetically very similar to modern cattle breeds, but highly divergent from the north-central european aurochsen.


CONCLUSIONS
complete mitochondrial genome sequences are now available for several modern cattle and two pre-neolithic mtdna genomes from very different geographic areas. these data suggest that previously identified sub-groups within the widespread modern cattle mitochondrial t clade are polyphyletic, and they support the hypothesis that modern european breeds have multiple geographic origins.
