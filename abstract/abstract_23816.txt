BACKGROUND
the n-terminal sh <dig> domain  of the non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase shp- <dig> is involved both in localization of shp- <dig> by recognition of phosphotyrosine  peptides and self-inhibition of shp- <dig> phosphatase activity through the formation of a protein – protein interface with the phosphatase domain. mutations that disrupt this interface break the coupling between py-peptide binding cleft conformation and self-inhibition, thereby increasing both shp- <dig> phosphatase activity and py-peptide binding affinity, and are associated with the congenital condition noonan syndrome and various pediatric leukemias. to better characterize the molecular process involved in n-sh <dig> py-dependent binding, we have applied explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations to study the closed-to-open transition of the n-sh <dig> py-peptide binding cleft.


RESULTS
the existence of stable conformations in the left-handed helical and the extended regions of tyr <dig> φ/ψ space prevent rapid interconversion of the backbone and create a conformational switch such that tyr <dig> in a left-handed helical backbone conformation results in an open cleft and in an extended backbone conformation results in a closed cleft. the stable conformations arise from deep, well-localized free-energy minima in the left-handed helical and extended regions of the tyr <dig> φ/ψ map. changing the tyr <dig> backbone conformation from extended to left-handed helical induces a closed-to-open transition in the cleft, and the reverse change in backbone conformation induces the reverse, open-to-closed transition. in the open-cleft state, weak solvent-exposed interactions involving the sidechains of tyr <dig>  asp <dig>  lys <dig>  and gln <dig> serve to anchor the tyr <dig> sidechain to the surface of the protein and away from the binding cleft entrance, thereby facilitating py-peptide access to the binding cleft.


CONCLUSIONS
the simulations point to a regulatory role for tyr <dig> and surrounding residues in shp- <dig> function: mutations at tyr <dig>  asp <dig>  lys <dig>  and/or gln <dig> are predicted to break the switching mechanism and negatively impact py-peptide binding. this in turn would interfere with cellular localization and the coupled shp- <dig> phosphatase activity. the structurally well-defined binding cleft conformations resulting from the switch-like transition suggest the possibility of applying structure-based methods to develop inhibitors of n-sh <dig> py-peptide binding to serve as research tools for signal transduction and precursors to therapeutics for shp-2-related diseases.
