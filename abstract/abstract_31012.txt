BACKGROUND
sirenia  have no evolutionary relationship with other marine mammals, despite similarities in adaptations and body shape. recent phylogenomic results place sirenia in afrotheria and with elephants and rock hyraxes in paenungulata. sirenia and hyracoidea are the two afrotherian orders as yet unstudied by comparative molecular cytogenetics. here we report on the chromosome painting of the florida manatee.


RESULTS
the human autosomal and x chromosome paints delimited a total of  <dig> homologous segments in the manatee genome. the synteny of nine of the  <dig> human autosomal chromosomes  and the x chromosome were found intact in the manatee. the syntenies of other human chromosomes were disrupted in the manatee genome into two to five segments. the hybridization pattern revealed that  <dig>  associations of human chromosome segments are found in the manatee genome: 1/ <dig>  1/ <dig>  2/ <dig> , 3/ <dig> , 3/ <dig>  3/ <dig>  5/ <dig>  7/ <dig>  8/ <dig>  10/ <dig> , 11/ <dig>  12/ <dig> , 14/ <dig>  16/ <dig> and 18/ <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
there are five derived chromosome traits that strongly link elephants with manatees in tethytheria and give implicit support to paenungulata: the associations 2/ <dig>  3/ <dig>  8/ <dig>  18/ <dig> and the loss of the ancestral eutherian 4/ <dig> association. it would be useful to test these conclusions with chromosome painting in hyraxes. the manatee chromosome painting data confirm that the associations 1/ <dig> and 5/ <dig> phylogenetically link afrotherian species and show that afrotheria is a natural clade. the association 10/12/ <dig> is also ubiquitous in afrotheria , present in laurasiatheria , only partially present in xenarthra  and absent in euarchontoglires . if afrotheria is basal to eutherians, this association could be part of the ancestral eutherian karyotype. if afrotherians are not at the root of the eutherian tree, then the 10/12/ <dig> association could be one of a suite of derived associations linking afrotherian taxa.
