BACKGROUND
accurate identification of novel, functional noncoding  rna features in genome sequence has proven more difficult than for exons. current algorithms identify and score potential rna secondary structures on the basis of thermodynamic stability, conservation, and/or covariance in sequence alignments. neither the algorithms nor the information gained from the individual inputs have been independently assessed. furthermore, due to issues in modelling background signal, it has been difficult to gauge the precision of these algorithms on a genomic scale, in which even a seemingly small false-positive rate can result in a vast excess of false discoveries.


RESULTS
we developed a shuffling algorithm, shuffle-pair.pl, that simultaneously preserves dinucleotide frequency, gaps, and local conservation in pairwise sequence alignments. we used shuffle-pair.pl to assess precision and recall of six ncrna search tools  was significantly higher for real than shuffled sequence, while the distribution for coding sequences was lower than that of corresponding shuffles.


CONCLUSIONS
accurate prediction of novel rna structural elements in genome sequence remains a difficult problem, and development of an appropriate negative-control strategy for multiple alignments is an important practical challenge. nonetheless, the general trends we observed for the distributions of predicted ncrnas across genomic features are biologically meaningful, supporting the presence of secondary structural elements in many 3' utrs, and providing evidence for evolutionary selection against secondary structures in coding regions.
