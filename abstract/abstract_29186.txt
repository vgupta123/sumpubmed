BACKGROUND
acinetobacter baumannii is a notorious opportunistic pathogen mainly associated with hospital-acquired infections. studies on the clonal relatedness of isolates could lay the foundation for effective infection control. a snapshot study was performed to investigate the clonal relatedness of a. baumannii clinical isolates in our local settings.


RESULTS
among  <dig> non-repetitive acinetobacter spp. clinical isolates that were recovered during a period of four days in  <dig> hospitals in sichuan, southwest china,  <dig> isolates were identified as a. baumannii. half of the  <dig> a. baumannii isolates were non-susceptible to carbapenems. blaoxa- <dig> was the only acquired carbapenemase gene detected, present in  <dig> isolates including five carbapenem-susceptible ones. the isolates belonged to  <dig> pulsotypes determined by pfge and  <dig> sequence types  by multi-locus sequence typing. forty-three isolates belonged to the globally-disseminated clonal complex  <dig>  among which st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> were the most common sequence types.


CONCLUSIONS
clinical isolates of a. baumannii were diverse in clonality in this snapshot study. however, most of the isolates belonged to the globally-distributed clonal complex cc <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> were the most common types in our region. in particular, st <dig> might be an emerging lineage carrying blaoxa- <dig>
