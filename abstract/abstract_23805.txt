BACKGROUND
experts in peptide:mhc binding studies are often able to estimate the impact of a single residue substitution based on a heuristic understanding of amino acid similarity in an experimental context. our aim is to quantify this measure of similarity to improve peptide:mhc binding prediction methods. this should help compensate for holes and bias in the sequence space coverage of existing peptide binding datasets.


RESULTS
here, a novel amino acid similarity matrix  is directly derived from the binding affinity data of combinatorial peptide mixtures. like blosum <dig>  this matrix captures well-known physicochemical properties of amino acid residues. however, pmbec differs markedly from existing matrices in cases where residue substitution involves a reversal of electrostatic charge. to demonstrate its usefulness, we have developed a new peptide:mhc class i binding prediction method, using the matrix as a bayesian prior. we show that the new method can compensate for missing information on specific residues in the training data. we also carried out a large-scale benchmark, and its results indicate that prediction performance of the new method is comparable to that of the best neural network based approaches for peptide:mhc class i binding.


CONCLUSIONS
a novel amino acid similarity matrix has been derived for peptide:mhc binding interactions. one prominent feature of the matrix is that it disfavors substitution of residues with opposite charges. given that the matrix was derived from experimentally determined peptide:mhc binding affinity measurements, this feature is likely shared by all peptide:protein interactions. in addition, we have demonstrated the usefulness of the matrix as a bayesian prior in an improved scoring-matrix based peptide:mhc class i prediction method. a software implementation of the method is available at: http://www.mhc-pathway.net/smmpmbec.
