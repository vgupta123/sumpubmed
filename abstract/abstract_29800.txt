BACKGROUND
phylogenetic trees are an important tool for representing evolutionary relationships among organisms. in a phylogram or chronogram, the ordering of taxa is not considered meaningful, since complete topological information is given by the branching order and length of the branches, which are represented in the root-to-node direction. we apply a novel method based on a -evolutionary algorithm to give meaning to the order of taxa in a phylogeny. this method applies random swaps between two taxa connected to the same node, without changing the topology of the tree. the evaluation of a new tree is based on different distance matrices, representing non-phylogenetic information such as other types of genetic distance, geographic distance, or combinations of these. to test our method we use published trees of vesicular stomatitis virus, west nile virus and rice yellow mottle virus.


RESULTS
best results were obtained when taxa were reordered using geographic information. information supporting phylogeographic analysis was recovered in the optimized tree, as evidenced by clustering of geographically close samples. improving the trees using a separate genetic distance matrix altered the ordering of taxa, but not topology, moving the longest branches to the extremities, as would be expected since they are the most divergent lineages. improved representations of genetic and geographic relationships between samples were also obtained when merged matrices  were used.


CONCLUSIONS
our innovative method makes phylogenetic trees easier to interpret, adding meaning to the taxon order and helping to prevent misinterpretations.
