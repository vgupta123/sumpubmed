BACKGROUND
evc is essential for indian hedgehog  signalling in the cartilage growth plate. the gene encoding evc <dig> is in close proximity in divergent orientation to evc and mutations in both human genes lead to the chondrodysplasia ellis-van creveld syndrome.


RESULTS
bioinformatic analysis reveals that the evc and evc <dig> genes arose through a duplication event early in metazoan evolution and were subsequently lost in arthropods and nematodes. here we demonstrate that evc <dig> is essential for hh pathway activation in response to the smo agonist purmorphamine. a yeast two-hybrid screen using evc as bait identified evc <dig> as an evc binding partner and we confirmed the interaction by immunoprecipitation. we developed anti-evc <dig> antibodies and show that evc <dig> and evc co-localize at the basal body and also on primary cilia. in transfected cells, basal body and cilia localization is observed when evc and evc <dig> constructs are co-transfected but not when either construct is transfected individually. we show that evc and evc <dig> are cilia transmembrane proteins, the c-terminus for both being intracellular and evc <dig>  but not evc, having an extracellular portion. furthermore, evc is absent at the basal body in evc <dig> null cells. using western blots of cytoplasmic and nuclear protein, we also demonstrate that full length evc <dig> but not evc, is located in the nucleus.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate for the first time that evc <dig> is a positive regulator of the hh signalling pathway and that it is located at the basal body of primary cilia. we show that the presence of evc and evc <dig> at the basal body and cilia membrane is co-dependent. in addition, evc <dig>  but not evc, is present in the cell nucleus suggesting movement of evc <dig> between the cilium and nucleus.
