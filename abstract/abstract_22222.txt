BACKGROUND
recently, metabolic syndrome  has gained attention in human metabolic medicine given its associations with development of type  <dig> diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. canine obesity is associated with the development of insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, and mild hypertension, but the authors are not aware of any existing studies examining the existence or prevalence of ms in obese dogs.

thirty-five obese dogs were assessed before and after weight loss . the diagnostic criteria of the international diabetes federation were modified in order to define canine obesity-related metabolic dysfunction , which included a measure of adiposity , systolic blood pressure, fasting plasma cholesterol, plasma triglyceride, and fasting plasma glucose. by way of comparison, total body fat mass was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, whilst total adiponectin, fasting insulin, and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein  were measured using validated assays.


RESULTS
systolic blood pressure , cholesterol , triglyceride , and fasting insulin  all decreased after weight loss, whilst plasma total adiponectin increased . however, hscrp did not change with weight loss. prior to weight loss,  <dig> dogs were defined as having ormd, and there was no difference in total fat mass between these dogs and those who did not meet the criteria for ormd. however, plasma adiponectin concentration was less , and plasma insulin concentration was greater  in ormd dogs.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, approximately 20% of obese dogs suffer from ormd, and this is characterized by hypoadiponectinaemia and hyperinsulinaemia. these studies can form the basis of further investigations to determine path genetic mechanisms and the health significance for dogs, in terms of disease associations and outcomes of weight loss.
