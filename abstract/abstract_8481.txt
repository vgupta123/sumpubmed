BACKGROUND
igfbp- <dig> has been considered as a factor involving in development of the central nervous system , but its role needs to be further clarified. in present study, the localization of igfbp- <dig> expression in the embryonic forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain was determined using immunohistochemistry, and the levels of igfbp- <dig> protein and mrna were semi-quantified using rt-pcr and western blot in the embryonic  and postnatal brain .


RESULTS
a clear immunoreactivity of igfbp- <dig> covered almost the entire embryonic brain  from e <dig>  to e <dig> , except for the area near the ventricle from e <dig> . the change of igfbp- <dig> mrna level was regularly from e <dig>  to e <dig> : its expression peaked at e <dig>  and e <dig> , followed by gradual decreasing from e <dig> . the expression of igfbp- <dig> protein was similar to that of mrna in embryonic stage. after birth, the pattern of igfbp- <dig> expression was shown to be rather divergent in different brain areas. in the cerebral cortex, the igfbp- <dig> mrna increased gradually after birth , while the protein showed little changes from p <dig> to p <dig>  but decreased significantly at p <dig>  in the cerebellum, the igfbp- <dig> mrna decreased gradually from p <dig>  reached the lowest level at p <dig>  and then increased again. however, its protein level gradually increased from p <dig> to p <dig>  in the midbrain, the igfbp- <dig> mrna first decreased and reached its lowest level at p <dig> before it increased, while the protein remained constant from p <dig> to p <dig>  at p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  the levels of igfbp- <dig> mrna in the cerebral cortex were significantly higher than that in the cerebellum or in the midbrain. differently, the protein levels in the cerebellum were significantly higher than that either in the cerebral cortex or in the midbrain at p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the temporal expression pattern of igfbp- <dig> in the embryonic brain from e <dig>  to e <dig>  was consistent with the course of neurogenesis in the ventricular zone, suggesting an important role of igfbp- <dig> in regulating differentiation of neural stem cells. a strikingly higher abundance of the igfbp- <dig> protein observed in the cerebellum from p <dig> to p <dig> suggests that igfbp- <dig> may participate in the maintenance of cerebellar plasticity.
