BACKGROUND
in order to investigate host factors associated with the establishment of persistent foot-and-mouth disease virus  infection, the systemic response to vaccination and challenge was studied in  <dig> steers. eighteen steers that had received a recombinant fmdv a vaccine  <dig> weeks earlier and  <dig> non-vaccinated steers were challenged by intra-nasopharyngeal deposition of fmdv a <dig>  for up to 35 days after challenge, host factors including complete blood counts with t lymphocyte subsets, type i/iii interferon  activity, neutralizing and total fmdv-specific antibody titers in serum, as well as antibody-secreting cells  were characterized in the context of viral infection dynamics.


RESULTS
vaccination generally induced a strong antibody response. there was a transient peak of fmdv-specific serum igm in non-vaccinated animals after challenge, while igm levels in vaccinated animals did not increase further. both groups had a lasting increase of specific igg and neutralizing antibody after challenge.

substantial systemic ifn activity in non-vaccinated animals coincided with viremia, and no ifn or viremia was detected in vaccinated animals. after challenge, circulating lymphocytes decreased in non-vaccinated animals, coincident with viremia, ifn activity, and clinical disease, whereas lymphocyte and monocyte counts in vaccinated animals were unaffected by vaccination but transiently increased after challenge. the cd4+/cd8+ t cell ratio in non-vaccinated animals increased during acute infection, driven by an absolute decrease of cd8+ cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the incidence of fmdv persistence was  <dig>  % in non-vaccinated and  <dig>  % in vaccinated animals. overall, the systemic factors examined were not associated with the fmdv carrier/non-carrier divergence; however, significant differences were identified between responses of non-vaccinated and vaccinated cattle.
