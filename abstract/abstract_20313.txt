BACKGROUND
knowledge of the genetic basis of plant resistance to necrotrophic pathogens is incomplete and has been characterised in relatively few pathosystems. in this study, the cytology and genetics of resistance to spring black stem and leaf spot caused by phoma medicaginis, an economically important necrotrophic pathogen of medicago spp., was examined in the model legume m. truncatula.


RESULTS
macroscopically, the resistant response of accession sa <dig> was characterised by small, hypersensitive-like spots following inoculation while the susceptible interaction with accessions a <dig> and sa <dig> showed necrotic lesions and spreading chlorosis. no unique cytological differences were observed during early infection  between the resistant and susceptible genotypes, except pathogen growth was restricted to one or a few host cells in sa <dig>  in both interactions reactive oxygen intermediates and phenolic compounds were produced, and cell death occurred. two f <dig> populations segregating for resistance to spring black stem and leaf spot were established between sa <dig> and the two susceptible accessions, a <dig> and sa <dig>  the cross between sa <dig> and a <dig> represented a wider cross than between sa <dig> and sa <dig>  as evidenced by higher genetic polymorphism, reduced fertility and aberrant phenotypes of f <dig> progeny. in the sa <dig> × a <dig> f <dig> population a highly significant quantitative trait locus  named resistance to the necrotroph phoma medicaginis one  genetically mapped to the top arm of linkage group  <dig> . rnpm <dig> explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance in the population's response to infection depicted on a 1– <dig> scale and was tightly linked to marker aw <dig>  a second highly significant qtl , rnpm <dig>  was located on the lower arm of lg <dig> in the sa <dig> × sa <dig> map. rnpm <dig> explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance and was fine mapped to a  <dig>  cm interval between markers h2_16a6a and h2_21h11d. rnpm <dig> is tightly linked to a cluster of toll/interleukin <dig> receptor-nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat  genes and disease resistance protein-like genes, while no resistance gene analogues  are apparent in the genomic sequence of the reference accession a <dig> at the rnpm <dig> locus.


CONCLUSIONS
the induction of defence responses and cell death in the susceptible interaction following infection by p. medicaginis suggested this pathogen is not negatively affected by these responses and may promote them. a qtl for resistance was revealed in each of two populations derived from crosses between a resistant accession and two different susceptible accessions. both loci are recessive in nature, and the simplest explanation for the existence of two separate qtls is the occurrence of host genotype-specific susceptibility loci that may interact with undetermined p. medicaginis virulence factors.
