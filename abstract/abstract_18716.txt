BACKGROUND
the popularity of new sequencing technologies has led to an explosion of possible applications, including new approaches in biodiversity studies. however each of these sequencing technologies suffers from sequencing errors originating from different factors. for 16s rrna metagenomics studies, the  <dig> pyrosequencing technology is one of the most frequently used platforms, but sequencing errors still lead to important data analysis issues . moreover, retaining a higher portion of the sequencing data by preserving as much of the read length as possible while maintaining the error rate within an acceptable range, will have important consequences at the level of taxonomic precision.


RESULTS
the new error correction algorithm proposed in this work - node  - is trained to identify those positions in  <dig> sequencing reads that are likely to have an error, and subsequently clusters those error-prone reads with correct reads resulting in error-free representative read. a benchmarking study with other denoising algorithms shows that node can detect up to 75% more errors in a large scale mock community dataset, and this with a low computational cost compared to the second best algorithm considered in this study. the positive effect of node in 16s rrna studies was confirmed by the beneficial effect on the precision of the clustering of pyrosequencing reads in operational taxonomic units.


CONCLUSIONS
node was shown to be a computational efficient denoising algorithm for pyrosequencing reads, producing the lowest error rates in an extensive benchmarking study with other denoising algorithms.
