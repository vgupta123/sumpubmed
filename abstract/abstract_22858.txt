BACKGROUND
the olfactory neuroepithelium lines the upper nasal cavity and is in direct contact with the external environment and the olfactory bulbs. the ability to self-renew throughout life and the reproducible recovery after injury, make it a model tissue to study mechanisms underlying neurogenesis. in this study, x-rays were used to disrupt proliferating olfactory stem cell populations and to assess their role in the cellular and morphological changes involved in olfactory neurogenic processes.


RESULTS
we have analysed the histological and functional effects of a sub-lethal dose of x-rays on the adult mouse olfactory neuroepithelium at  <dig> hours,  <dig> hours,  <dig> week,  <dig> weeks and  <dig> weeks. we have shown an immediate cessation of proliferating olfactory stem cells as shown by brdu, ki <dig> and ph <dig> expression. at  <dig> hours there was an increase in the neural transcription factors mash <dig> and pax <dig> expression, and a disruption of the basal lamina and increase in glandular cell marker expression at  <dig> week post-irradiation. coincident with these changes was an impairment of the olfactory function in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
we have shown significant changes in basal cell proliferation as well as morphological changes in the olfactory neuroepithelium following x-ray irradiation. there is involvement of the basal lamina as well as a clear role for glandular and sustentacular cells.
