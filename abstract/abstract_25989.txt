BACKGROUND
flux-balance analysis based on linear optimization is widely used to compute metabolic fluxes in large metabolic networks and gains increasingly importance in network curation and structural analysis. thus, a computational tool flexible enough to realize a wide variety of fba algorithms and able to handle batch series of flux-balance optimizations is of great benefit.


RESULTS
we present fasimu, a command line oriented software for the computation of flux distributions using a variety of the most common fba algorithms, including the first available implementation of  weighted flux minimization,  fitness maximization for partially inhibited enzymes, and  of the concentration-based thermodynamic feasibility constraint. it allows batch computation with varying objectives and constraints suited for network pruning, leak analysis, flux-variability analysis, and systematic probing of metabolic objectives for network curation. input and output supports sbml. fasimu can work with free  or commercial solvers . a new plugin  for bina allows to conveniently visualize calculated flux distributions. the platform-independent program is an open-source project, freely available under gnu public license at http://www.bioinformatics.org/fasimu including manual, tutorial, and plugins.


CONCLUSIONS
we present a flux-balance optimization program whose main merits are the implementation of thermodynamics as a constraint, batch series of computations, free availability of sources, choice on various external solvers, and the flexibility on metabolic objectives and constraints.
