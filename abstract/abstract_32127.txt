BACKGROUND
papillomaviruses  are a group of small, non-encapsulated, species-specific dna viruses that have been detected in a variety of mammalian and avian species including humans, canines and felines. pvs cause lesions in the skin and mucous membranes of the host and after persistent infection, a subset of pvs can cause tumors such as cervical malignancies and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in humans. pvs from several species have been isolated and their genomes have been sequenced, thereby increasing our understanding of the mechanism of viral oncogenesis and allowing for the development of molecular assays for the detection of pv infection. in humans, molecular testing for pv dna is used to identify patients with persistent infections at risk for developing cervical cancer. in felids, pvs have been isolated and sequenced from oral papillomatous lesions of several wild species including bobcats, asian lions and snow leopards. since a number of wild felids are endangered, pv associated disease is a concern and there is a need for molecular tools that can be used to further study papillomavirus in these species.


RESULTS
we used the sequence of the snow leopard papillomavirus uupv <dig> to develop a pcr strategy to amplify viral dna from samples obtained from captive animals. we designed primer pairs that flank the e <dig> and e <dig> viral oncogenes and amplify two dna fragments encompassing these genes. we detected viral dna for e <dig> and e <dig> in genomic dna isolated from saliva, but not in paired blood samples from snow leopards. we verified the identity of these pcr products by restriction digest and dna sequencing. the sequences of the pcr products were 100% identical to the published uupv <dig> genome sequence.


CONCLUSIONS
we developed a pcr assay to detect papillomavirus in snow leopards and amplified viral dna encompassing the e <dig> and e <dig> oncogenes specifically in the saliva of animals. this assay could be utilized for the molecular investigation of papillomavirus in snow leopards using saliva, thereby allowing the detection of the virus in the anatomical site where oral papillomatous lesions develop during later stages of infection and disease development.
