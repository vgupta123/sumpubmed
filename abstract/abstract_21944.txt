BACKGROUND
understanding of immune response mechanisms of pathogen-infected host requires multi-scale analysis of genome-wide data. data integration methods have proved useful to the study of biological processes in model organisms, but their systematic application to the study of host immune system response to a pathogen and human disease is still in the initial stage.


RESULTS
to study host-pathogen interaction on the systems biology level, an extension to the previously described biologicalnetworks system is proposed. the developed methods and data integration and querying tools allow simplifying and streamlining the process of integration of diverse experimental data types, including molecular interactions and phylogenetic classifications, genomic sequences and protein structure information, gene expression and virulence data for pathogen-related studies. the data can be integrated from the databases and user's files for both public and private use.


CONCLUSIONS
the developed system can be used for the systems-level analysis of host-pathogen interactions, including host molecular pathways that are induced/repressed during the infections, co-expressed genes, and conserved transcription factor binding sites. previously unknown to be associated with the influenza infection genes were identified and suggested for further investigation as potential drug targets. developed methods and data are available through the java application  and web interface .
