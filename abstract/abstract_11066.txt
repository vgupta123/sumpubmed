BACKGROUND
insulin-like growth factor- <dig>  is produced in various tissues to stimulate protein synthesis under different conditions. it is however, difficult to distinguish effects by locally produced igf- <dig> compared to liver-derived igf- <dig> appearing in the circulation. in the present study the role of liver-derived endocrine igf-i for activation of skeletal muscle protein synthesis following feeding was evaluated.


RESULTS
transgenic female mice with selective knockout of the igf-i gene in hepatocytes were freely fed, starved overnight and subsequently refed for  <dig> hours and compared to wild types . liver igf-i knockout mice had 70% reduced plasma igf-i. starvation decreased and refeeding increased muscle protein synthesis , similarly in both igf-i knockouts and wt mice. phosphorylation of p70s6k and mtor increased and 4ebp <dig> bound to eif4e decreased in both igf-i knockouts and wt mice after refeeding . muscle transcripts of igf-i decreased and igf-i receptor increased  in wild types during starvation but similar alterations did not reach significance in knockouts . mtor mrna increased in knockouts only during starvation. plasma glucose decreased during starvation in all groups in parallel to insulin, while plasma igf-i and gh did not change significantly among the groups during starvation-refeeding. plasma amino acids declined and increased during starvation-refeeding in wild type mice , but less so in igf-i  knockouts .


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that re-synthesis of muscle proteins following starvation is not critically dependent on endocrine liver-derived igf-i.
