BACKGROUND
an enduring question surrounding sex chromosome evolution is whether effective hemizygosity in the heterogametic sex leads inevitably to dosage compensation of sex-linked genes, and whether this compensation has been observed in a variety of organisms. incongruence in the conclusions reached in some recent reports has been attributed to different high-throughput approaches to transcriptome analysis. however, recent reports each utilizing rna-seq to gauge x-linked gene expression relative to autosomal gene expression also arrived at diametrically opposed conclusions regarding x chromosome dosage compensation in mammals.


RESULTS
here we analyze rna-seq data from x-monosomic female human and mouse tissues, which are uncomplicated by genes that escape x-inactivation, as well as published rna-seq data to describe relative x expression . we find that the determination of rxe is highly dependent upon a variety of computational, statistical and biological assumptions underlying rna-seq analysis. parameters implemented in short-read mapping programs, choice of reference genome annotation, expression data distribution, tissue source for rna and rna-seq library construction method have profound effects on comparing expression levels across chromosomes.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis shows that the high number of paralogous gene families on the mammalian x chromosome relative to autosomes contributes to the ambiguity in rxe calculations, rna-seq analysis that takes into account that single- and multi-copy genes are compensated differently supports the conclusion that, in many somatic tissues, the mammalian x is up-regulated compared to the autosomes.
