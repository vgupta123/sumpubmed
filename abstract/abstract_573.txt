BACKGROUND
worldwide, diseases are important reducers of peanut  yield. sources of resistance against many diseases are available in cultivated peanut genotypes, although often not in farmer preferred varieties. wild species generally harbor greater levels of resistance and even apparent immunity, although the linkage of agronomically un-adapted wild alleles with wild disease resistance genes is inevitable. marker-assisted selection has the potential to facilitate the combination of both cultivated and wild resistance loci with agronomically adapted alleles. however, in peanut there is an almost complete lack of knowledge of the regions of the arachis genome that control disease resistance.


RESULTS
in this work we identified candidate genome regions that control disease resistance. for this we placed candidate disease resistance genes and qtls against late leaf spot disease on the genetic map of the a-genome of arachis, which is based on microsatellite markers and legume anchor markers. these marker types are transferable within the genus arachis and to other legumes respectively, enabling this map to be aligned to other arachis maps and to maps of other legume crops including those with sequenced genomes. in total,  <dig> sequence-confirmed candidate disease resistance genes and five qtls were mapped.


CONCLUSIONS
candidate genes and qtls were distributed on all linkage groups except for the smallest, but the distribution was not even. groupings of candidate genes and qtls for late leaf spot resistance were apparent on the upper region of linkage group  <dig> and the lower region of linkage group  <dig>  indicating that these regions are likely to control disease resistance.
