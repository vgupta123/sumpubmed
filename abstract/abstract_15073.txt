BACKGROUND
the number of scarlet fever occurrences reported between  <dig> and  <dig> fluctuated considerably in central taiwan and throughout the nation. isolates of streptococcus pyogenes were collected from scarlet fever patients in central taiwan and were characterized by emm sequencing and a standardized pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  method. national weekly report data were collected for investigating epidemiological trends.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> emm types were identified in  <dig>  s. pyogenes isolates. the five most prevalent emm types were emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig> , emm <dig>  and emm <dig> . pfge analysis with smai suggested that, with a few exceptions, strains with a common emm type belonged to the same clone. there were two large emm <dig> clones, one with dna resistant to cleavage by smai. each prevalent emm clone had major pfge strain and many minor strains. most of the minor strains emerged in the population and disappeared soon after. even some major strains remained prevalent for only 2– <dig> years before declining. the large fluctuation of scarlet fever cases between  <dig> and  <dig> was associated with the shuffling of six prevalent emm clones. in  <dig>  the dramatic drop in scarlet fever cases in central taiwan and throughout the whole country was associated with the occurrence of a severe acute respiratory syndrome  outbreak that occurred between late-february and mid-june in taiwan.


CONCLUSIONS
the occurrences of scarlet fever in central taiwan in 2000– <dig> were primarily caused by five emm types, which accounted for  <dig> % of the isolates collected. most of the s. pyogenes strains  emerged and lasted for only a few years. the fluctuation in the number of scarlet fever cases during the seven years can be primarily attributed to the shuffling of six prevalent emm clones and to the sars outbreak in  <dig>
