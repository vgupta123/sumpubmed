BACKGROUND
for accuracy in navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation , determination of the hotspot location of small hand muscles is crucial because it is the basis for the resting motor threshold  and, therefore, its spatial resolution. we investigated intra- and interobserver differences of hotspot mapping to provide evidence for the reproducibility of this method.

ten subjects underwent ntms motor mapping of the hotspot for the abductor pollicis brevis muscle  three times. the first two sessions were performed by the same examiner; the third mapping was performed by a different examiner. distances between the first and second mappings  and between the second and third mappings  were measured.


RESULTS
intraobserver variability had a mean of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm   <dig>  to  <dig>  mm), whereas mean interobserver variability was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm . concerning rmt, ccc was  <dig>  . the mean variability in the same cortical depth was measured as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  for intraobserver and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  for interobserver examinations. when evaluating the rmt, ccc was  <dig>  .


CONCLUSIONS
overall, intraobserver variability showed higher reliability than interobserver variability. our findings show that we can achieve good reliability in hotspot determination, ranging within the calculated precision of the system.
