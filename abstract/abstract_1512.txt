BACKGROUND
apollo, a genome annotation viewer and editor, has become a widely used genome annotation and visualization tool for distributed genome annotation projects. when using apollo for annotation, database updates are carried out by uploading intermediate annotation files into the respective database. this non-direct database upload is laborious and evokes problems of data synchronicity.


RESULTS
to overcome these limitations we extended the apollo data adapter with a generic, configurable web service client that is able to retrieve annotation data in a game-xml-formatted string and pass it on to apollo's internal input routine.


CONCLUSIONS
this apollo web service adapter, apollo2go, simplifies the data exchange in distributed projects and aims to render the annotation process more comfortable.

the apollo2go software is freely available from .
