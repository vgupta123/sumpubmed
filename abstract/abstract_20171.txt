BACKGROUND
living cells are realized by complex gene expression programs that are moderated by regulatory proteins called transcription factors . the tfs control the differential expression of target genes in the context of transcriptional regulatory networks , either individually or in groups. deciphering the mechanisms of how the tfs control the expression of target genes is a challenging task, especially when multiple tfs collaboratively participate in the transcriptional regulation.


RESULTS
we model the underlying regulatory interactions in terms of the directions  and their logical roles  with a modified association rule mining approach, called mtrim. the experiment on yeast discovered  <dig> regulatory interactions, in which multiple tfs express their functions on common target genes collaboratively. the evaluation on yeast genetic interactions, tf knockouts and a synthetic dataset shows that our algorithm is significantly better than the existing ones.


CONCLUSIONS
mtrim is a novel method to infer tf collaborations in transcriptional regulation networks. mtrim is available at http://www.msu.edu/~jinchen/mtrim.
