BACKGROUND
although mice have long served as an animal model for periodontitis, information on the composition of their indigenous oral microbiota is limited. the aim of the current study was to characterize mouse oral bacterial flora by applying extensive parallel pyrosequencing using the latest model pyrosequencer, a roche/ <dig> genome sequencer flx titanium. in addition, the effect of toll-like receptor   <dig> deficiency on oral microbiota was evaluated.


RESULTS
eight oral bacterial communities of wild-type  and tlr <dig> knock-out  c57bl/ <dig> mice were characterized by analyzing  <dig>  reads of 16s rrna genes obtained by pyrosequencing. excluding the pcr primers, the average length of each sequencing product was  <dig> bp. the average species richness of the murine oral bacterial communities was estimated to be about  <dig>  but the communities were dominated by only two main phyla and several species. therefore, the bacterial communities were relatively simple. the bacterial composition of the murine oral microbiota was significantly different from that of humans, and the lack of tlr <dig> had a negligible effect on the murine oral microbiota.


CONCLUSIONS
pyrosequencing using the roche/ <dig> flx titanium successfully characterized mouse oral bacterial communities. the relatively simple oral bacterial communities of mice were not affected by tlr <dig> deficiency. these findings will provide a basis for future studies on the role of periodontal pathogens in the murine model of periodontitis.
