BACKGROUND
though important in the context of food microbiology and as potential pathogens in immuno-compromised humans, bacterial isolates belonging to the genus pediococcus are best known for their association with contamination of ethanol fermentation processes . use of antimicrobial compounds  by some industries to combat pediococcus contaminants is long-standing, yet knowledge about the resistance of pediococci to antimicrobial agents is minimal. here we examined pediococcus isolates to determine whether antibiotic resistance is associated with resistance to hops, presence of genes known to correlate with beer spoilage, or with ability to grow in beer.


RESULTS
lactic acid bacteria susceptibility test broth medium  used in combination with commercially available gpn3f antimicrobial susceptibility plates was an effective method for assessing antimicrobial susceptibility of pediococcus isolates. we report the finding of vancomycin-susceptible pediococcus isolates from four species. interestingly, we found that hop-resistant, beer-spoilage, and beer-spoilage gene-harbouring isolates had a tendency to be more susceptible, rather than more resistant, to antimicrobial compounds.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate that the mechanisms involved in conferring hop-resistance or ability to spoil beer by pediococcus isolates are not associated with resistance to antibiotics commonly used for treatment of human infections. also, vancomycin-resistance was found to be isolate-specific and not intrinsic to the genus as previously believed.
