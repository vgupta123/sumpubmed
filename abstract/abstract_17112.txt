BACKGROUND
diamondâ€“blackfan anemia is a rare congenital red blood cell dysplasia that develops soon after birth. rpl <dig> mutations account for approximately  <dig> % of human dba cases with defective hematopoietic phenotypes. however, the mechanisms by which rpl <dig> regulates hematopoiesis in dba remain elusive. in this study, we analyzed the transcriptome using deep sequencing data from an rpl11-deficient zebrafish model to identify rpl11-mediated hematopoietic failure and investigate the underlying mechanisms.


RESULTS
we characterized hematological defects in rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos by identifying affected hematological genes, hematopoiesis-associated pathways, and regulatory networks. we found that hemoglobin biosynthetic and hematological defects in rpl11-deficient zebrafish were related to dysregulation of iron metabolism-related genes, including tfa, tfr1b, alas <dig> and slc25a <dig>  which are involved in heme and hemoglobin biosynthesis. in addition, we found reduced expression of the hematopoietic stem cells  marker cmyb and hsc transcription factors tal <dig> and hoxb4a in rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos, indicating that the hematopoietic defects may be related to impaired hsc formation, differentiation, and proliferation. however, rpl <dig> deficiency did not affect the development of other blood cell lineages such as granulocytes and myelocytes.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified hematopoietic failure of rpl11-deficient zebrafish embryos using transcriptome deep sequencing and elucidated potential underlying mechanisms. the present analyses demonstrate that rpl11-deficient zebrafish may serve as a model of dba and may provide insights into the pathogenesis of mutant rpl11-mediated human dba disease.
