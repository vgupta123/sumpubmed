BACKGROUND
in mammalian cells, the integrity of the primary cilium is critical for proper regulation of the hedgehog  signal transduction pathway. whether or not this dependence on the primary cilium is a universal feature of vertebrate hedgehog signalling has remained contentious due, in part, to the apparent divergence of the intracellular transduction pathway between mammals and teleost fish.


RESULTS
here, using a functional gli2-gfp fusion protein, we show that, as in mammals, the gli <dig> transcription factor localizes to the primary cilia of cells in the zebrafish embryo and that this localization is modulated by the activity of the hh pathway. moreover, we show that the igu/dzip1protein, previously implicated in the modulation of gli activity in zebrafish, also localizes to the primary cilium and is required for its proper formation.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings demonstrate a conserved role of the primary cilium in mediating hedgehog signalling activity across the vertebrate phylum and validate the use of the zebrafish as a representative model for the in vivo analysis of vertebrate hedgehog signalling.
