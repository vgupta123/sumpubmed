BACKGROUND
the fungus pochonia chlamydosporia parasitizes nematode eggs and has become one of the most promising biological control agents  for plant-parasitic nematodes, which are major agricultural pests that cause tremendous economic losses worldwide. the complete mitochondrial  genome is expected to open new avenues for understanding the phylogenetic relationships and evolution of the invertebrate-pathogenic fungi in hypocreales.


RESULTS
the complete mitogenome sequence of p. chlamydosporia is  <dig>  bp in size, containing the  <dig> typical protein-coding genes, two ribosomal rna genes, an intronic orf coding for a putative ribosomal protein  and a set of  <dig> transfer rna genes  which recognize codons for all amino acids. sequence similarity studies and syntenic gene analyses show that  <dig> % and  <dig> % of p. chlamydosporia mitogenome sequences match  <dig> % of metarhizium anisopliae sequences and  <dig> % of lecanicillium muscarium sequences with  <dig> % and  <dig> % identities, respectively. a phylogenetic tree inferred from  <dig> mt proteins in pezizomycotina fungi supports that p. chlamydosporia is most closely related to the entomopathogenic fungus m. anisopliae. the invertebrate-pathogenic fungi in hypocreales cluster together and clearly separate from a cluster comprising plant-pathogenic fungi  and hypocrea jecorina. a comparison of mitogenome sizes shows that the length of the intergenic regions or the intronic regions is the major size contributor in most of mitogenomes in sordariomycetes. evolutionary analysis shows that rps <dig> is under positive selection, leading to the display of unique evolutionary characteristics in hypocreales. moreover, the variability of trn distribution has a clear impact on gene order in mitogenomes. gene rearrangement analysis shows that operation of transposition drives the rearrangement events in pezizomycotina, and most events involve in trn position changes, but no rearrangement was found in clavicipitaceae.


CONCLUSIONS
we present the complete annotated mitogenome sequence of p. chlamydosporia. based on evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses, we have determined the relationships between the invertebrate-pathogenic fungi in hypocreales. the invertebrate-pathogenic fungi in hypocreales referred to in this paper form a monophyletic group sharing a most recent common ancestor. our rps <dig> and trn gene order results also establish a foundation for further exploration of the evolutionary trajectory of the fungi in hypocreales.
