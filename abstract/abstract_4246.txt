BACKGROUND
an important question in genetic studies is to determine those genetic variants, in particular cnvs, that are specific to different groups of individuals. this could help in elucidating differences in disease predisposition and response to pharmaceutical treatments. we propose a bayesian model designed to analyze thousands of copy number variants  where only few of them are expected to be associated with a specific phenotype.


RESULTS
the model is illustrated by analyzing three major human groups belonging to hapmap data. we also show how the model can be used to determine specific cnvs related to response to treatment in patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer. the model is also extended to address the problem of how to adjust for confounding covariates . through a simulation study, we show that the proposed model outperforms other approaches that are typically used to analyze this data when analyzing common copy-number polymorphisms  or complex cnvs. we have developed an r package, called bayesgen, that implements the model and estimating algorithms.


CONCLUSIONS
our proposed model is useful to discover specific genetic variants when different subgroups of individuals are analyzed. the model can address studies with or without control group. by integrating all data in a unique model we can obtain a list of genes that are associated with a given phenotype as well as a different list of genes that are shared among the different subtypes of cases.
