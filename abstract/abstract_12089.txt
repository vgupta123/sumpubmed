BACKGROUND
glycyrrhiza uralensis is one of the most popular medicinal plants in the world and is also widely used in the flavoring of food and tobacco. due to limited genomic and transcriptomic data, the biosynthetic pathway of glycyrrhizin, the major bioactive compound in g. uralensis, is currently unclear. identification of candidate genes involved in the glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathway will significantly contribute to the understanding of the biosynthetic and medicinal chemistry of this compound.


RESULTS
we used the  <dig> gs flx platform and titanium regents to produce a substantial expressed sequence tag  dataset from the vegetative organs of g. uralensis. a total of  <dig>  ests with an average read length of  <dig> bp were generated.  <dig> ests were combined with the  <dig>  g. uralensis ests in genbank. the combined ests were assembled into  <dig>  unique sequences . a total of  <dig>  unique gene elements representing approximately  <dig>  independent transcripts were annotated using blast searches  against the swissprot, kegg, tair, nr and nt databases. the assembled sequences were annotated with gene names and gene ontology  terms. with respect to the genes related to glycyrrhizin metabolism, genes encoding  <dig> enzymes of the  <dig> total steps of the glycyrrhizin skeleton synthesis pathway were found. to identify novel genes that encode cytochrome p <dig> enzymes and glycosyltransferases, which are related to glycyrrhizin metabolism, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes were found to be homologous to cytochrome p450s and glycosyltransferases, respectively. the cytochrome p <dig> candidate genes were classified into  <dig> cyp families, while the glycosyltransferase candidate genes were classified into  <dig> categories by go analysis.  finally,  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> enzymes and  <dig> glycosyltransferases were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis through an organ-specific expression pattern analysis based on real-time pcr.


CONCLUSIONS
using the  <dig> gs flx platform and titanium reagents, our study provides a high-quality est database for g. uralensis. based on the est analysis, novel candidate genes related to the secondary metabolite pathway of glycyrrhizin, including novel genes encoding cytochrome p450s and glycosyltransferases, were found. with the assistance of organ-specific expression pattern analysis,  <dig> unigenes encoding cytochrome p450s and  <dig> unigenes encoding glycosyltransferases were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis.
