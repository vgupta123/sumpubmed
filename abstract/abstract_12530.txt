BACKGROUND
the rapid detection of sensory change is important to survival. the process should relate closely to memory since it requires that the brain separate a new stimulus from an ongoing background or past event. given that sensory memory monitors current sensory status and works to pick-up changes in real-time, any change detected by this system should evoke a change-related cortical response. to test this hypothesis, we examined whether the single presentation of a sound is enough to elicit a change-related cortical response, and therefore, shape a memory trace enough to separate a subsequent stimulus.


RESULTS
under a paradigm where two pure sounds  <dig> ms in duration and  <dig> or  <dig> hz in frequency were presented in a specific order at an even probability, cortical responses to each sound were measured with magnetoencephalograms. sounds were grouped to five events regardless of their frequency, 1d, 2d, and 3d , and 1s and 2s . whereas activation in the planum temporale did not differ among events, activation in the superior temporal gyrus  was clearly greater for the different events  than the same event .


CONCLUSIONS
one presentation of a sound is enough to shape a memory trace for comparison with a subsequent physically different sound and elicits change-related cortical responses in the stg. the stg works as a real-time sensory gate open to a new event.
