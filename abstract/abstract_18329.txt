BACKGROUND
spi-b and pu. <dig> are highly related members of the e26-transformation-specific  family of transcription factors that have similar, but not identical, roles in b cell development. pu. <dig> and spi-b are both expressed in b cells, and have been demonstrated to redundantly activate transcription of genes required for b cell differentiation and function. it was hypothesized that spi-b and pu. <dig> occupy a similar set of regions within the genome of a b lymphoma cell line.


RESULTS
to compare binding regions of spi-b and pu. <dig>  murine wehi- <dig> lymphoma cells were infected with retroviral vectors encoding 3xflag-tagged pu. <dig> or spi-b. anti-flag chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing  was performed. analysis for high-stringency enriched genomic regions demonstrated that pu. <dig> occupied  <dig> regions and spi-b occupied  <dig> regions. the majority of regions occupied by spi-b were also occupied by pu. <dig>  regions bound by spi-b and pu. <dig> were frequently located immediately upstream of genes associated with immune response and activation of b cells. motif-finding revealed that both transcription factors were predominantly located at the ets core domain , however, other unique motifs were identified when examining regions associated with only one of the two factors. motifs associated with unique pu. <dig> binding included pou2f <dig>  while unique motifs in the spi-b regions contained a combined ets-irf motif.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that complementary biological functions of pu. <dig> and spi-b may be explained by their interaction with a similar set of regions in the genome of b cells. however, sites uniquely occupied by pu. <dig> or spi-b provide insight into their unique functions.
