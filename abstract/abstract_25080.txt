BACKGROUND
a number of large genomic datasets are being generated for studies of human ancestry and diseases. the admixture program is commonly used to infer individual ancestry from genomic data.


RESULTS
we describe two improvements to the admixture software. the first enables admixture to infer ancestry for a new set of individuals using cluster allele frequencies from a reference set of individuals. using data from the  <dig> genomes project, we show that this allows admixture to infer ancestry for  <dig>  individuals in a few hours . this mode also allows admixture to correctly estimate individual ancestry and allele frequencies from a set of related individuals. the second modification allows admixture to correctly handle x-chromosome  data from both males and females. we demonstrate increased power to detect sex-biased admixture in african-american individuals from the  <dig> genomes project using this extension.


CONCLUSIONS
these modifications make admixture more efficient and versatile, allowing users to extract more information from large genomic datasets.
