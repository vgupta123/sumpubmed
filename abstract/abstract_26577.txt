BACKGROUND
as high-throughput technologies rapidly generate genome-scale data, it becomes increasingly important to visually integrate these data so that specific hypotheses can be formulated and tested.


RESULTS
we present mochiview, a platform-independent java software that integrates browsing of genomic sequences, features, and data with dna motif visualization and analysis in a visually-appealing and user-friendly application.


CONCLUSIONS
while highly versatile, the software is particularly useful for organizing, exploring, and analyzing large genomic data sets, such as those from deep rna sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments , and transcriptional profiling. mochiview provides an extensive suite of utilities to identify and to explore connections between these data sets and short sequence motifs present in dna or rna.
