BACKGROUND
escherichia coli is a model prokaryote, an important pathogen, and a key organism for industrial biotechnology. e. coli w , one of four strains designated as safe for laboratory purposes, has not been sequenced. e. coli w is a fast-growing strain and is the only safe strain that can utilize sucrose as a carbon source. lifecycle analysis has demonstrated that sucrose from sugarcane is a preferred carbon source for industrial bioprocesses.


RESULTS
we have sequenced and annotated the genome of e. coli w. the chromosome is  <dig> , <dig> bp and encodes  <dig>  orfs. two plasmids, prk <dig>  and prk <dig> , are also present. w has unique features relative to other sequenced laboratory strains : it has a larger genome and belongs to phylogroup b <dig> rather than a. w also grows on a much broader range of carbon sources than does k- <dig>  a genome-scale reconstruction was developed and validated in order to interrogate metabolic properties.


CONCLUSIONS
the genome of w is more similar to commensal and pathogenic b <dig> strains than phylogroup a strains, and therefore has greater utility for comparative analyses with these strains. w should therefore be the strain of choice, or 'type strain' for group b <dig> comparative analyses. the genome annotation and tools created here are expected to allow further utilization and development of e. coli w as an industrial organism for sucrose-based bioprocesses. refinements in our e. coli metabolic reconstruction allow it to more accurately define e. coli metabolism relative to previous models.
