BACKGROUND
mycobacteria can be quickly and simply identified by pcr restriction-enzyme analysis , but misidentification can occur because of similarities in band sizes that are critical for discriminating among species. capillary electrophoresis can provide computer-aided band discrimination. the aim of this research was to develop an algorithm for identifying mycobacteria by combined rpob duplex pra  and hsp <dig> pra with capillary electrophoresis.


RESULTS
three hundred and seventy-six acid-fast bacillus smear-positive bactec cultures, including  <dig> mycobacterium tuberculosis complexes  and  <dig> non-tuberculous mycobacteria  were analyzed. with combined hsp <dig> and rpob dpra, the accuracy rate was 100%  for the mtc and  <dig> %  for the ntm. among the discordant results  for the ntm, one isolate of mycobacterial species and an isolate of m. flavescens were found as new sub-types in hsp <dig> pra.


CONCLUSIONS
this effective and novel identification algorithm using combined rpob dpra and hsp <dig> pra with capillary electrophoresis can rapidly identify mycobacteria and find new sub-types in hsp <dig> pra. in addition, it is complementary to  <dig> s rdna sequencing.
