BACKGROUND
the construction of linkage maps is a first step in exploring the genetic basis for adaptive phenotypic divergence in closely related species by quantitative trait locus  analysis. linkage maps are also useful for comparative genomics in non-model organisms. advances in genomics technologies make it more feasible than ever to study the genetics of adaptation in natural populations. restriction-site associated dna  sequencing in next-generation sequencers facilitates the development of many genetic markers and genotyping. we aimed to construct a linkage map of the gudgeons of the genus gnathopogon  for comparative genomics with the zebrafish danio rerio  and for the future qtl analysis of the genetic architecture underlying adaptive phenotypic evolution of gnathopogon.


RESULTS
we constructed the first genetic linkage map of gnathopogon using a 198 f <dig> interspecific cross between two closely related species in japan: river-dwelling gnathopogon elongatus and lake-dwelling gnathopogon caerulescens. based on  <dig>  rad-tag markers, a linkage map spanning  <dig> .9 cm with  <dig> linkage groups and an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm was constructed. we also identified a region involving female-specific transmission ratio distortion . synteny and collinearity were extensively conserved between gnathopogon and zebrafish.


CONCLUSIONS
the dense snp-based linkage map presented here provides a basis for future qtl analysis. it will also be useful for transferring genomic information from a “traditional” model fish species, zebrafish, to screen candidate genes underlying ecologically important traits of the gudgeons.
