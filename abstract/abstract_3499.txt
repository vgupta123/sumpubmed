BACKGROUND
quantitative analysis of differential protein expressions requires to align temporal elution measurements from liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry . we propose multiple canonical correlation analysis  as a method to align the non-linearly distorted time scales of repeated lc/ms experiments in a robust way.


RESULTS
multiple canonical correlation analysis is able to map several time series to a consensus time scale. the alignment function is learned in a supervised fashion. we compare our approach with previously published methods for aligning mass spectrometry data on a large proteomics dataset. the proposed method significantly increases the number of proteins that are identified as being differentially expressed in different biological samples.


CONCLUSIONS
jointly aligning multiple liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry samples by mcca substantially increases the detection rate of potential bio-markers which significantly improves the interpretability of lc/ms data.
