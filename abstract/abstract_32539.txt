BACKGROUND
we investigated the molecular basis of primary open-angle glaucoma  using opticin  as a candidate gene on the basis of its expression in the trabecular meshwork cells involved in the disease pathogenesis. two hundred poag patients and  <dig> controls were enrolled in this study. the coding sequence of optc was amplified by pcr from genomic dna of poag patients, followed by sscp, dhplc and dna sequencing. subsequent bioinformatic analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, quantitative rt-pcr and western blot experiments were performed to address the functional significance of a 'silent' change in the optc coding region while screening for mutations in poag patients.


RESULTS
we detected two missense  and one silent change  that was present in  <dig> different patients but in none of the  <dig> controls screened. the mutant  mrna was predicted to have remarkably different secondary structure compared to the wild-type transcript by in silico approaches. subsequent wet-lab experiments showed lower expression of the gene both at the mrna and protein levels.


CONCLUSIONS
our study suggests optc as a candidate gene for poag. further, it highlights the importance of investigating the 'silent' variations for functional implication that might not be apparent from only in silico analysis.
