BACKGROUND
identification and characterization of molecular controls that regulate mammary stem and progenitor cell homeostasis are critical to our understanding of normal mammary gland development and its pathology.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that conditional knockout of sox <dig> in the mouse mammary gland results in impaired postnatal development. in short-term lineage tracing in the postnatal mouse mammary gland using sox9-creer driven reporters, sox <dig> marked primarily the luminal progenitors and bipotent stem/progenitor cells within the basal mammary epithelial compartment. in contrast, long-term lineage tracing studies demonstrate that sox9+ precursors gave rise to both luminal and myoepithelial cell lineages. finally, fate mapping of sox <dig> deleted cells demonstrates that sox <dig> is essential for luminal, but not myoepithelial, lineage commitment and proliferation.


CONCLUSIONS
these studies identify sox <dig> as a key regulator of mammary gland development and stem/progenitor maintenance.
