BACKGROUND
community-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  is a significant bacterial pathogen that poses considerable clinical and public health challenges. the majority of the ca-mrsa disease burden consists of skin and soft tissue infections  not associated with significant morbidity; however, ca-mrsa also causes severe, invasive infections resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. the broad range of disease severity may be influenced by bacterial genetic variation.


RESULTS
we sequenced the complete genomes of  <dig> ca-mrsa clinical isolates from the predominant north american community acquired clonal type usa <dig> . while all  <dig> isolates shared remarkable genetic similarity, we found greater overall time-dependent sequence diversity among ssti isolates. in addition, pathway analysis of non-synonymous variations revealed increased sequence diversity in the putative virulence genes of ssti isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
here we report the first whole genome survey of diverse clinical isolates of the usa <dig> lineage and describe the evolution of the pathogen over time within a defined geographic area. the results demonstrate the close relatedness of clinically independent ca-mrsa isolates, which carry implications for understanding ca-mrsa epidemiology and combating its spread.
