BACKGROUND

pichia pastoris shows physiological advantages in producing recombinant proteins, compared to other commonly used cell factories. this yeast is mostly grown in dynamic cultivation systems, where the cell’s environment is continuously changing and many variables influence process productivity. in this context, a model capable of explaining and predicting cell behavior for the rational design of bioprocesses is highly desirable. currently, there are five genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of p. pastoris which have been used to predict extracellular cell behavior in stationary conditions.


RESULTS
in this work, we assembled a dynamic genome-scale metabolic model for glucose-limited, aerobic cultivations of pichia pastoris. starting from an initial model structure for batch and fed-batch cultures, we performed pre/post regression diagnostics to ensure that model parameters were identifiable, significant and sensitive. once identified, the non-relevant ones were iteratively fixed until a priori robust modeling structures were found for each type of cultivation. next, the robustness of these reduced structures was confirmed by calibrating the model with new datasets, where no sensitivity, identifiability or significance problems appeared in their parameters. afterwards, the model was validated for the prediction of batch and fed-batch dynamics in the studied conditions.

lastly, the model was employed as a case study to analyze the metabolic flux distribution of a fed-batch culture and to unravel genetic and process engineering strategies to improve the production of recombinant human serum albumin . simulation of single knock-outs indicated that deviation of carbon towards cysteine and tryptophan formation improves hsa production. the deletion of methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase could increase the hsa volumetric productivity by 630%. moreover, given specific bioprocess limitations and strain characteristics, the model suggests that implementation of a decreasing specific growth rate during the feed phase of a fed-batch culture results in a 25% increase of the volumetric productivity of the protein.


CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we formulated a dynamic genome scale metabolic model of pichia pastoris that yields realistic metabolic flux distributions throughout dynamic cultivations. the model can be calibrated with experimental data to rationally propose genetic and process engineering strategies to improve the performance of a p. pastoris strain of interest.
