BACKGROUND
bovine tuberculosis is prevalent in algeria despite governmental attempts to control the disease. the objective of this study was to conduct, for the first time, molecular characterization of a population sample of mycobacterium bovis strains isolated from slaughter cattle in algeria. between august and november  <dig>   <dig> animals were consecutively screened at the abattoirs of algiers and blida. in  <dig> animals, gross visible granulomatous lesions were detected and put into culture. bacterial isolates were subsequently analysed by molecular methods.


RESULTS
altogether,  <dig> bacterial strains from  <dig> animals were subjected to molecular characterization. m. bovis was isolated from  <dig> animals. other bacteria isolated included one strain of m. caprae, four rhodococcus equi strains, three non-tuberculous mycobacteria  and five strains of other bacterial species. the m. bovis strains isolated showed  <dig> different spoligotype patterns; four of them had not been previously reported. the majority of m. bovis strains  showed spoligotype patterns that were previously observed in strains from european cattle. variable number of tandem repeat  typing supported a link between m. bovis strains from algeria and france. one spoligotype pattern has also been shown to be frequent in m. bovis strains from mali although the vntr pattern of the algerian strains differed from the malian strains.


CONCLUSIONS
m. bovis infections account for a high amount of granulomatous lesions detected in algerian slaughter cattle during standard meat inspection at algiers and blida abattoir. molecular typing results suggested a link between algerian and european strains of m. bovis.
