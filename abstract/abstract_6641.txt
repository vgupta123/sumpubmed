BACKGROUND
in humans, mutations in the sepn <dig> gene, encoding selenoprotein n , are involved in early onset recessive neuromuscular disorders, referred to as sepn1-related-myopathies. the mechanisms behind these pathologies are poorly understood since the function of seln remains elusive. however, previous results obtained in humans and more recently in zebrafish pointed to a potential role for seln during embryogenesis. using qrt-pcr, western blot and whole mount in situ hybridization, we characterized in detail the spatio-temporal expression pattern of the murine sepn <dig> gene during development, focusing particularly on skeletal muscles.


RESULTS
in whole embryos, sepn <dig> transcripts were detected as early as e <dig> , with expression levels peaking at e <dig> , and then strongly decreasing until birth. in isolated tissues, only mild transcriptional variations were observed during development, whereas a striking reduction of the protein expression was detected during the perinatal period. furthermore, we demonstrated that sepn <dig> is expressed early in somites and restricted to the myotome, the sub-ectodermal mesenchyme and the dorsal root ganglia at mid-gestation stages. interestingly, sepn <dig> deficiency did not alter somitogenesis in embryos, suggesting that seln is dispensable for these processes in mouse.


CONCLUSIONS
we characterized for the first time the expression pattern of sepn <dig> during mammalian embryogenesis and we demonstrated that its differential expression is most likely dependent on major post-transcriptional regulations. overall, our data strongly suggest a potential role for selenoprotein n from mid-gestation stages to the perinatal period. interestingly, its specific expression pattern could be related to the current hypothesis that selenoprotein n may regulate the activity of the ryanodine receptors.
