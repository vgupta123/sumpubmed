BACKGROUND
next-generation sequencing technologies are widely used for detection of millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms  and also provide a means of assessing their variation. this information is useful for composing subsets of highly informative snps for region-specific or genome-wide analysis and to identify mutations regulating phenotypic differences within or between populations. in this study, we investigated the sensitivity of snp detection and introduced the flanking snps value  as a novel measure for predicting snp-variability using ~5x genome resequencing with abi solid and dna pools from two chicken lines divergently selected for juvenile bodyweight.


RESULTS
genotyping with a  <dig> k snp chip revealed polymorphisms within or between two divergently selected chicken lines for  <dig>  <dig> snps, 48% of which were also detected using resequencing of dna pools. snp detection using resequencing was more powerful for positions with larger differences in allele frequency between the lines. about 50% of the snps with non-reference allele frequencies in the range  <dig> - <dig>  and 67% of those with frequencies >  <dig>  could be detected. on average, ~ <dig>  snps/kb were detected by resequencing, with about 5% lower density on microchromosomes than on macrochromosomes. there was a positive correlation between the observed between-line snp variation from the  <dig> k chip analysis and our proposed fsv score computed from the genome resequencing data. the strongest correlations on macrochromosomes and microchromosomes were observed when the fsv was calculated with total flanking regions of  <dig> kb  and  <dig> kb , respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
genome resequencing with limited coverage  using pooled dna samples and three non-reference reads as a threshold for snp detection, identified  <dig> - 67% of the  <dig> k snps with a non-reference allele frequency larger than  <dig> . the snp density was around 5% lower on the microchromosomes, most likely because of their higher gene content. our proposed method to estimate the snp variation  uses additional sequence information to better predict snp informativity. the fsv scores showed higher correlations for snps with a larger difference in allele frequency between the populations. the correlation was strongest on macrochromosomes, probably due to a lower recombination rate.
