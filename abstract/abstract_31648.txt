BACKGROUND
more than  <dig> billion individuals worldwide suffer from helminth infections. the highest parasite burdens occur in children and helminth infection during pregnancy is a risk factor for preterm delivery and reduced birth weight. therefore, helminth infections can be regarded as a strong selective pressure.


RESULTS
here we propose that candidate susceptibility genes for parasitic worm infections can be identified by searching for snps that display a strong correlation with the diversity of helminth species/genera transmitted in different geographic areas. by a genome-wide search we identified  <dig> variants that correlate with helminth diversity. these snps map to  <dig> distinct human genes including loci involved in regulatory t cell function and in macrophage activation, as well as leukocyte integrins and co-inhibitory molecules. analysis of functional relationships among these genes identified complex interaction networks centred around th <dig> cytokines. finally, several genes carrying candidate targets for helminth-driven selective pressure also harbour susceptibility alleles for asthma/allergy or are involved in airway hyper-responsiveness, therefore expanding the known parallelism between these conditions and parasitic infections.


CONCLUSIONS
our data provide a landscape of human genes that modulate susceptibility to helminths and indicate parasitic worms as one of the major selective forces in humans.
