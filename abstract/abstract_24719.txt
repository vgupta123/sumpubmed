BACKGROUND
interspecific hybridization creates individuals harboring diverged genomes. the interaction of these genomes can generate successful evolutionary novelty or disadvantageous genomic conflict. annual sunflowers helianthus annuus and h. petiolaris have a rich history of hybridization in natural populations. although first-generation hybrids generally have low fertility, hybrid swarms that include later generation and fully fertile backcross plants have been identified, as well as at least three independently-originated stable hybrid taxa. we examine patterns of transcript accumulation in the earliest stages of hybridization of these species via analyses of transcriptome sequences from laboratory-derived f <dig> offspring of an inbred h. annuus cultivar and a wild h. petiolaris accession.


RESULTS
while nearly 14% of the reference transcriptome showed significant accumulation differences between parental accessions, total f <dig> transcript levels showed little evidence of dominance, as midparent transcript levels were highly predictive of transcript accumulation in f <dig> plants. allelic bias in f <dig> transcript accumulation was detected in 20% of transcripts containing sufficient polymorphism to distinguish parental alleles; however the magnitude of these biases were generally smaller than differences among parental accessions.


CONCLUSIONS
while analyses of allelic bias suggest that cis regulatory differences between h. annuus and h. petiolaris are common, their effect on transcript levels may be more subtle than trans-acting regulatory differences. overall, these analyses found little evidence of regulatory incompatibility or dominance interactions between parental genomes within f <dig> hybrid individuals, although it is unclear whether this is a legacy or an enabler of introgression between species.
