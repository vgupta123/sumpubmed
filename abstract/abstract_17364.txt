BACKGROUND
stanniocalcin  <dig>  is a secreted protein activated by -like endoplasmic reticulum kinase  signalling under conditions of er stress in vitro. over-expression of stc <dig> in mice leads to a growth-restricted phenotype; however, the physiological function for stc <dig> has remained elusive. given the relationship of stc <dig> to perk signalling, the objective of this study was to examine the role of stc <dig> in perk signalling in vivo.


RESULTS
since perk signalling has both physiological and pathological roles in the pancreas, stc <dig> expression was assessed in mouse pancreata before and after induction of injury using a cerulein-induced pancreatitis  model. increased stc <dig> expression was identified within four hours of initiating pancreatic injury and correlated to increased activation of perk signalling. to determine the effect of stc <dig> over-expression on perk, mice systemically expressing human stc <dig>  were examined. stc2tg pancreatic tissue exhibited normal pancreatic morphology, but altered activation of perk signalling, including increases in activating transcription factor   <dig> accumulation and autophagy. upon induction of pancreatic injury, stc2tg mice exhibited limited increases in circulating amylase levels and increased maintenance of cellular junctions.


CONCLUSIONS
this study links stc <dig> to the pathological activation of perk in vivo, and suggests involvement of stc <dig> in responding to pancreatic acinar cell injury.
