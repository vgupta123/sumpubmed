BACKGROUND
a positive relationship between diversification  and nucleotide substitution rates is commonly reported for angiosperm clades. however, the underlying cause of this relationship is often unknown because multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors can affect the relationship, and these have confounded previous attempts infer causation. determining which factor drives this oft-reported correlation can lend insight into the macroevolutionary process.


RESULTS
using a new database of  <dig> time-calibrated angiosperm phylogenies based on internal transcribed spacer  sequences, and controlling for extrinsic variables of life history and habitat, i evaluated several potential intrinsic causes of this correlation. speciation rates  and relative extinction rates  were positively correlated with mean substitution rates, but were uncorrelated with substitution rate heterogeneity. it is unlikely that the positive diversification-substitution correlation is due to accelerated molecular evolution during speciation , because punctuated increases in its rate  were not observed. instead, fast molecular evolution likely increases speciation rate  but also increases extinction .


CONCLUSIONS
in general, these results predict that clades with higher background substitution rates may undergo successful diversification under new conditions while clades with lower substitution rates may experience decreased extinction during environmental stasis.
