BACKGROUND
purifying stem cells is an inevitable process for further investigation and cell-therapy. sorting side population  cells is generally regarded as an effective method to enrich for progenitor cells. this study was to explore whether sorting sp could enrich for the musashi <dig>  positive cells from msi <dig> high expression cells  derived from mouse embryonic stem cells  in vitro.


RESULTS
in this study, msi1high cell population derived from escs were stained by hoechst  <dig>  and then the sp and non-sp  fractions were analyzed and sorted by fluorescence activated cell sorter. subsequently, the expressions of msi <dig> and other markers for neural and intestinal stem cells in sp and nsp were respectively detected. sp and nsp cells were hypodermically engrafted into the backs of nod/scid mice to form grafts. the developments of neural and intestinal epithelial cells in these grafts were investigated. sp fraction was identified and isolated from msi1high cell population. the expression of msi <dig> in sp fraction was significantly higher than that in nsp fraction and unsorted msi1high cells . furthermore, the markers for neural cells and intestinal epithelial cells were more highly expressed in the grafts from sp fraction than those from nsp fraction .


CONCLUSIONS
sp fraction, isolated from msi1high cells, contains almost all the msi1-positive cells and has the potential to differentiate into neural and intestinal epithelial cells in vivo. sorting sp fraction could be a convenient and practical method to enrich for msi1-positive cells from the differentiated cell population derived from escs.
