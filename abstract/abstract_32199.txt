BACKGROUND
chromatin immunoprecipitation on tiling arrays  has been widely used to investigate the dna binding sites for a variety of proteins on a genome-wide scale. however, several issues in the processing and analysis of chip-chip data have not been resolved fully, including the effect of background  subtraction and normalization within and across arrays.


RESULTS
the binding profiles of drosophila male-specific lethal  complex on a tiling array provide a unique opportunity for investigating these topics, as it is known to bind on the x chromosome but not on the autosomes. these large bound and control regions on the same array allow clear evaluation of analytical methods.

we introduce a novel normalization scheme specifically designed for chip-chip data from dual-channel arrays and demonstrate that this step is critical for correcting systematic dye-bias that may exist in the data. subtraction of the mock  control data is generally needed to eliminate the bias, but appropriate normalization obviates the need for mock experiments and increases the correlation among replicates. the idea underlying the normalization can be used subsequently to estimate the background noise level in each array for normalization across arrays. we demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods with the msl complex binding data and other publicly available data.


CONCLUSIONS
proper normalization is essential for chip-chip experiments. the proposed normalization technique can correct systematic errors and compensate for the lack of mock control data, thus reducing the experimental cost and producing more accurate results.
