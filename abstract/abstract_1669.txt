BACKGROUND
epinotia aporema  is an important pest of legume crops in south america. epinotia aporema granulovirus  is a baculovirus that causes a polyorganotropic infection in the host larva. its high pathogenicity and host specificity make epapgv an excellent candidate to be used as a biological control agent.


RESULTS
the genome of epinotia aporema granulovirus  was sequenced and analyzed. its circular double-stranded dna genome is  <dig>  bp in length and codes for  <dig> putative genes. it contains the  <dig> baculovirus core genes and a set of  <dig> genes that are gv exclusive. seventeen orfs were unique to epapgv in comparison with other baculoviruses. of these,  <dig> found no homologues in genbank, and one encoded a thymidylate kinase. analysis of nucleotide sequence repeats revealed the presence of  <dig> homologous regions  interspersed throughout the genome. each hr was characterized by the presence of  <dig> to  <dig> clustered imperfect palindromes which are similar to previously described palindromes of tortricid-specific gvs. also, one of the hrs  has flanking sequences suggestive of a putative non-hr ori. interestingly, two more complex hrs were found in opposite loci, dividing the circular dsdna genome in two halves. gene synteny maps showed the great colinearity of sequenced gvs, being epapgv the most dissimilar as it has a  <dig> kb-long gene block inversion. phylogenetic study performed with  <dig> core genes of  <dig> baculoviral genomes suggests that epapgv is the baculovirus isolate closest to the putative common ancestor of tortricid specific betabaculoviruses.


CONCLUSIONS
this study, along with previous characterization of epapgv infection, is useful for the better understanding of the pathology caused by this virus and its potential utilization as a bioinsecticide.
