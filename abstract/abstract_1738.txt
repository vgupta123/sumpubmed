BACKGROUND
strain cpac  <dig>  was recently reclassified into the new species bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens; due to its outstanding efficiency in fixing nitrogen, it has been used in commercial inoculants for application to crops of soybean  in brazil and other south american countries. although the efficiency of b. diazoefficiens inoculant strains is well recognized, few data on their protein expression are available.


RESULTS
we provided a two-dimensional proteomic reference map of cpac  <dig> obtained under free-living conditions, with the successful identification of  <dig> spots, representing  <dig> different proteins. the results highlighted the expression of molecular determinants potentially related to symbiosis establishment , fixation of atmospheric nitrogen   and defenses against stresses . by using bioinformatic tools, it was possible to attribute probable functions to ten hypothetical proteins. for another ten proteins classified as “no related cog” group, we analyzed by rt-qpcr the relative expression of their coding-genes in response to the nodulation-gene inducer genistein. six of these genes were up-regulated, including blr <dig>  which may be related to polyhydroxybutyrate  biosynthesis and competitiveness for nodulation.


CONCLUSIONS
the proteomic map contributed to the identification of several proteins of b. diazoefficiens under free-living conditions and our approach—combining bioinformatics and gene-expression assays—resulted in new information about unknown genes that might play important roles in the establishment of the symbiosis with soybean.
