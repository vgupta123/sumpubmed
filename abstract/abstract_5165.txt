BACKGROUND
several approaches, including metabolic control analysis , flux balance analysis , correlation metric construction , and biochemical circuit theory , have been developed for the quantitative analysis of complex biochemical networks. here, we present a comprehensive theory of linear analysis for nonequilibrium steady-state  biochemical reaction networks that unites these disparate approaches in a common mathematical framework and thermodynamic basis.


RESULTS
in this theory a number of relationships between key matrices are introduced: the matrix a obtained in the standard, linear-dynamic-stability analysis of the steady-state can be decomposed as a = srt where r and s are directly related to the elasticity-coefficient matrix for the fluxes and chemical potentials in mca, respectively; the control-coefficients for the fluxes and chemical potentials can be written in terms of rtbs and stbs respectively where matrix b is the inverse of a; the matrix s is precisely the stoichiometric matrix in fba; and the matrix eat plays a central role in cmc.


CONCLUSIONS
one key finding that emerges from this analysis is that the well-known summation theorems in mca take different forms depending on whether metabolic steady-state is maintained by flux injection or concentration clamping. we demonstrate that if rate-limiting steps exist in a biochemical pathway, they are the steps with smallest biochemical conductances and largest flux control-coefficients. we hypothesize that biochemical networks for cellular signaling have a different strategy for minimizing energy waste and being efficient than do biochemical networks for biosynthesis. we also discuss the intimate relationship between mca and biochemical systems analysis .
