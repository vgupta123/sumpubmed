BACKGROUND
in gnathostomes, chemosensory receptors  expressed in olfactory epithelia are encoded by evolutionarily dynamic gene families encoding odorant receptors , trace amine-associated receptors , v1rs and v2rs. a limited number of or-like sequences have been found in invertebrate chordate genomes. whether these gene families arose in basal or advanced vertebrates has not been resolved because these families have not been examined systematically in agnathan genomes.


RESULTS
petromyzon is the only extant jawless vertebrate whose genome has been sequenced. known to be exquisitely sensitive to several classes of odorants, lampreys detect fewer amino acids and steroids than teleosts. this reduced number of detectable odorants is indicative of reduced numbers of cr gene families or a reduced number of genes within cr families, or both, in the sea lamprey. in the lamprey genome we identified a repertoire of  <dig> intact single-exon cr genes, including  <dig> or,  <dig> taar, and four v1r-like genes. these three cr families were expressed in the olfactory organ of both parasitic and adult life stages.


CONCLUSIONS
an extensive search in the lamprey genome failed to identify potential orthologs or pseudogenes of the multi-exon v2r family that is greatly expanded in teleost genomes, but did find intact calcium-sensing receptors  and intact metabotropic glutamate receptors . we conclude that or and v1r arose in chordates after the cephalochordate-urochordate split, but before the diversification of jawed and jawless vertebrates. the advent and diversification of v2r genes from glutamate receptor-family g protein-coupled receptors, most likely the casr, occurred after the agnathan-gnathostome divergence.
