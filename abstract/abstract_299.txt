BACKGROUND
urate oxidase  catalyzes the conversion of uric acid and gaseous molecular oxygen to 5-hydroxyisourate and hydrogen peroxide, in the absence of cofactor or particular metal cation. the functional enzyme is a homo-tetramer with four active sites located at dimeric interfaces.


RESULTS
the catalytic mechanism was investigated through a ternary complex formed between the enzyme, uric acid, and cyanide that stabilizes an intermediate state of the reaction. when uric acid is replaced by a competitive inhibitor, no complex with cyanide is formed.


CONCLUSIONS
the x-ray structure of this compulsory ternary complex led to a number of mechanistic evidences that support a sequential mechanism in which the two reagents, dioxygen and a water molecule, process through a common site located  <dig>  Ã… above the mean plane of the ligand. this site is built by the side chains of asn  <dig>  and thr  <dig>  two conserved residues belonging to two different subunits of the homo-tetramer. the absence of a ternary complex between the enzyme, a competitive inhibitor, and cyanide suggests that cyanide inhibits the hydroxylation step of the reaction, after the initial formation of a hydroperoxyde type intermediate.
