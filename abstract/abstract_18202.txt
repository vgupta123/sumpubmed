BACKGROUND
because of their known role as transcriptional regulators of key plant developmental processes, the diversification of mads-box gene function is thought to be a major driving force in the developmental evolution of plants. yet the function of some mads-box gene subfamilies has remained elusive thus far. one such lineage, agl <dig>  has now been functionally characterized in three angiosperm species, but a phylogenetic framework for comparison of agl <dig> gene function is currently missing.


RESULTS
based on phylogenetic analyses of newly isolated and est-based sequences, we describe the duplication history of the agl <dig> subfamily in angiosperms. our analyses provide support for four ancient duplications in the evolution of the agl <dig> lineage: one at the base of core eudicots resulting in euagl <dig> and agl6-like gene clades, one during basal angiosperm diversification and two in monocot evolution. to investigate whether the spatial domains in which agl <dig> genes function have diverged after duplication, we use quantitative real time pcr. we show that the core eudicot agl6-like clade acquired expression in vegetative tissues, while its paralog euagl <dig> remains predominantly confined to reproductive tissues.


CONCLUSIONS
these and previous data lead us to propose that the agl <dig> lineage in core eudicots, in addition to functions related to the expression in reproductive structures, may have acquired a function in developmental transitions of vegetative shoots.
