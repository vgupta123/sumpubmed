BACKGROUND
sequence alignment is one of the most important techniques to analyze biological systems. it is also true that the alignment is not complete and we have to develop it to look for more accurate method. in particular, an alignment for homologous sequences with low sequence similarity is not in satisfactory level. usual methods for aligning protein sequences in recent years use a measure empirically determined. as an example, a measure is usually defined by a combination of two quantities  and  below:  the sum of substitutions between two residue segments,  the sum of gap penalties in insertion/deletion region. such a measure is determined on the assumption that there is no an intersite correlation on the sequences. in this paper, we improve the alignment by taking the correlation of consecutive residues.


RESULTS
we introduced a new method of alignment, called mtrap by introducing a metric defined on compound systems of two sequences. in the benchmark tests by prefab  <dig>  and homstrad, our pairwise alignment method gives higher accuracy than other methods such as clustalw <dig>  tcoffee, mafft. especially for the sequences with sequence identity less than 15%, our method improves the alignment accuracy significantly. moreover, we also showed that our algorithm works well together with a consistency-based progressive multiple alignment by modifying the tcoffee to use our measure.


CONCLUSIONS
we indicated that our method leads to a significant increase in alignment accuracy compared with other methods. our improvement is especially clear in low identity range of sequences. the source code is available at our web page, whose address is found in the section "availability and requirements".
