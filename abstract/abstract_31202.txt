BACKGROUND
reliable reference genes are a vital prerequisite for any functional study employing quantitative real-time rt-pcr  for analyzing gene expression. yet a proper selection and assessment of the chosen reference genes is only rarely included into a study. to date, no reference genes have been validated for differentiation of thp- <dig> monocytes. here we report on the selection of validated reference genes during differentiation of thp- <dig> monocytes into macrophages induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate .


RESULTS
the mrna expression of  <dig> preselected potential reference genes was measured by rt-qpcr at several time-points over six days of pma-induced thp- <dig> monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. a ranking according to expression stability was calculated. calculations were performed using microsoft excel-based applets genorm, normfinder and bestkeeper. our results indicated actb   and rpl37a   as the most stable genes. while other frequently used reference genes such as gapdh   or g6pd   were found to be not as reliable and were therefore unsuited for use as reference genes. these findings were validated by investigating mrna expression of macrophage scavenger receptor cd <dig>  known to be regulated during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. using actb and rpl37a as reference genes a profound and significant regulation of cd <dig> could be demonstrated, while use of g6pd resulted in a much less pronounced apparent regulation of cd <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
consequently, it is recommended to normalize any real-time pcr-based expression data obtained during thp- <dig> monocyte differentiation using actb and rpl37a.
