BACKGROUND
small proline rich protein  2a is one of  <dig> sprr genes that encodes for a skin cross-linking protein, which confers structural integrity to the cornified keratinocyte cell envelope. new evidence, however, shows that sprr2a is also a critical stress and wound repair modulator: it enables a variety of barrier epithelia to transiently acquire mesenchymal characteristics  and simultaneously quench reactive oxygen species during wound repair responses. p <dig> is also widely recognized as the node in cellular stress responses that inhibits emt and triggers cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and cellular senescence. since some p53-directed processes would seem to impede wound repair of barrier epithelia, we hypothesized that sprr2a up regulation might counteract these effects and enable/promote wound repair under stressful environmental conditions.


RESULTS
using a well characterized cholangiocarcinoma cell line we show that levels of sprr2a expression, similar to that seen during stressful biliary wound repair responses, disrupts acetylation and subsequent p <dig> transcriptional activity. p <dig> deacetylation is accomplished via two distinct, but possibly related, mechanisms: 1) a reduction of p <dig> acetylation, thereby interfering with p300-p <dig> binding and subsequent p <dig> acetylation of k <dig> in p53; and 2) an increase in histone deacetylase  <dig>  mrna and protein expression. the p <dig> ch <dig> domain is essential for both the autoacetylation of p <dig> and transference of the acetyl group to p <dig> and hdac <dig> is a component of several non-p <dig> complexes that enhance p <dig> deacetylation, ubiquitination, and proteosomal degradation. hdac <dig> can also bind the p300-ch <dig> domain, regulating p <dig> acetylation and interfering with p <dig> mediated p <dig> acetylation. the importance of this pathway is illustrated by showing complete restoration of p <dig> acetylation and partial restoration of p <dig> acetylation by treating sprr2a expressing cells with hdac <dig> sirna.


CONCLUSIONS
up-regulation of sprr2a, similar to that seen during barrier epithelia wound repair responses reduces p <dig> acetylation by interfering with p300-p <dig> interactions and by increasing hdac <dig> expression. sprr2a, therefore, functions as a suppressor of p53-dependent transcriptional activity, which otherwise might impede cellular processes needed for epithelial wound repair responses such as emt.
