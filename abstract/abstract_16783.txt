BACKGROUND
understanding the genome sequence-specific positioning of nucleosomes is essential to understand various cellular processes, such as transcriptional regulation and replication. as a typical example, the 10-bp periodicity of aa/tt and gc dinucleotides has been reported in several species, but it is still unclear whether this feature can be observed in the whole genomes of all eukaryotes.


RESULTS
with fourier analysis, we found that this is not the case: 84-bp and 167-bp periodicities are prevalent in primates. the 167-bp periodicity is intriguing because it is almost equal to the sum of the lengths of a nucleosomal unit and its linker region. after masking alu elements, these periodicities were greatly diminished. next, using two independent large-scale sets of nucleosome mapping data, we analyzed the distribution of nucleosomes in the vicinity of alu elements and showed that  there are one or two fixed slot for nucleosome positioning within the alu element and  the positioning of neighboring nucleosomes seems to be in phase, more or less, with the presence of alu elements. furthermore,  these effects of alu elements on nucleosome positioning are consistent with inactivation of promoter activity in alu elements.


CONCLUSIONS
our discoveries suggest that the principle governing nucleosome positioning differs greatly across species and that the alu family is an important factor in primate genomes.
