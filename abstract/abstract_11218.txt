BACKGROUND
reassortment between the rna segments encoding haemagglutinin  and neuraminidase , the major antigenic influenza proteins, produces viruses with novel ha and na subtype combinations and has preceded the emergence of pandemic strains. it has been suggested that productive viral infection requires a balance in the level of functional activity of ha and na, arising from their closely interacting roles in the viral life cycle, and that this functional balance could be mediated by genetic changes in the ha and na. here, we investigate how the selective pressure varies for h <dig> avian influenza ha on different na subtype backgrounds.


RESULTS
by extending bayesian stochastic mutational mapping methods to calculate the ratio of the rate of non-synonymous change to the rate of synonymous change , we found the average dn/ds across the avian influenza h <dig> ha <dig> region to be significantly greater on an n <dig> na subtype background than on an n <dig>  n <dig> or n <dig> background. observed differences in evolutionary rates of h <dig> ha on different na subtype backgrounds could not be attributed to underlying differences between avian host species or virus pathogenicity. examination of dn/ds values for each subtype on a site-by-site basis indicated that the elevated dn/ds on the n <dig> na background was a result of increased selection, rather than a relaxation of selective constraint.


CONCLUSIONS
our results are consistent with the hypothesis that reassortment exposes influenza ha to significant changes in selective pressure through genetic interactions with na. such epistatic effects might be explicitly accounted for in future models of influenza evolution.
