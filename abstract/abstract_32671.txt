BACKGROUND
vanilla planifolia is an important orchid commercially cultivated for the production of natural vanilla flavour. vanilla plants are conventionally propagated by stem cuttings and thus causing injury to the mother plants. regeneration and in vitro mass multiplication are proposed as an alternative to minimize damage to mother plants. because mass production of v. planifolia through indirect shoot differentiation from callus culture is rare and may be a successful use of in vitro techniques for producing somaclonal variants, we have established a novel protocol for the regeneration of vanilla plants and investigated the initial biochemical and molecular mechanisms that trigger shoot organogenesis from embryogenic/organogenic callus.


RESULTS
for embryogenic callus induction, seeds obtained from 7-month-old green pods of v. planifolia were inoculated on ms basal medium  containing tdz . germination of unorganized mass callus such as protocorm -like structure  arising from each seed has been observed. the primary embryogenic calli have been formed after transferring on bm containing iaa  and tdz . these calli were maintained by subculturing on bm containing iaa  and tdz  during  <dig> months and formed embryogenic/organogenic calli. histological analysis showed that shoot organogenesis was induced between  <dig> and  <dig> days after embryogenic/organogenic calli were transferred onto ms basal medium with naa . by associating proteomics and metabolomics analyses, the biochemical and molecular markers responsible for shoot induction have been studied in 15-day-old calli at the stage where no differentiating part was visible on organogenic calli. two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-tandem mass spectrometry  analysis revealed that  <dig> protein spots are significantly expressed  at earlier stages of shoot differentiation. the majority of these proteins are involved in amino acid-protein metabolism and photosynthetic activity. in accordance with proteomic analysis, metabolic profiling using 1d and 2d nmr techniques showed the importance of numerous compounds related with sugar mobilization and nitrogen metabolism. nmr analysis techniques also allowed the identification of some secondary metabolites such as phenolic compounds whose accumulation was enhanced during shoot differentiation.


CONCLUSIONS
the subculture of embryogenic/organogenic calli onto shoot differentiation medium triggers the stimulation of cell metabolism principally at three levels namely  initiation of photosynthesis, glycolysis and phenolic compounds synthesis;  amino acid - protein synthesis, and protein stabilization;  sugar degradation. these biochemical mechanisms associated with the initiation of shoot formation during protocorm - like body  organogenesis could be coordinated by the removal of tdz in callus maintenance medium. these results might contribute to elucidate the complex mechanism that leads to vanilla callus differentiation and subsequent shoot formation into plb organogenesis. moreover, our results highlight an early intermediate metabolic event in vanillin biosynthetic pathway with respect to secondary metabolism. indeed, for the first time in vanilla tissue culture, phenolic compounds such as glucoside a and glucoside b were identified. the degradation of these compounds in specialized tissue  probably contributes to the biosynthesis of glucovanillin, the parent compound of vanillin.
