BACKGROUND
the transcriptional regulator c-myc is the most frequently deregulated oncogene in human tumors. targeted overexpression of this gene in mice results in distinct types of lung adenocarcinomas. by using microarray technology, alterations in the expression of genes were captured based on a female transgenic mouse model in which, indeed, c-myc overexpression in alveolar epithelium results in the development of bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma  and papillary adenocarcinoma . in this study, we analyzed exclusively the promoters of induced genes by different in silico methods in order to elucidate the c-myc transcriptional regulatory network.


RESULTS
we analyzed the promoters of  <dig> transcriptionally induced genes with respect to c-myc binding sites and found  <dig> putative binding sites in  <dig> promoters. furthermore, we analyzed the flanking sequences  around the  <dig> c-myc binding sites and found ap <dig>  zf <dig>  zic <dig>  and e2f binding sites to be overrepresented in these regions. then, we analyzed the promoters of  <dig> induced genes with respect to binding sites of other transcription factors  which were upregulated by c-myc overexpression. we identified at least one binding site of at least one of these tfs in  <dig> promoters, thus elucidating a potential transcription factor network. the analysis correlated well with the significant overexpression of the tfs atf <dig>  foxf1a, smad <dig>  sox <dig>  sp <dig> and stat5a. finally, we analyzed promoters of regulated genes which where apparently not regulated by c-myc or other c-myc targeted tfs and identified overrepresented oct <dig>  mzf <dig>  ppargamma, plzf, ets, and hmgiy binding sites when compared against control promoter background.


CONCLUSIONS
our in silico data suggest a model of a transcriptional regulatory network in which different tfs act in concert upon c-myc overexpression. we determined molecular rules for transcriptional regulation to explain, in part, the carcinogenic effect seen in mice overexpressing the c-myc oncogene.
