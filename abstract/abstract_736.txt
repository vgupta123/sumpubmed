BACKGROUND
sulphur is an essential macronutrient needed for the synthesis of many cellular components. sulphur containing amino acids and stress response-related compounds, such as glutathione, are derived from reduction of root-absorbed sulphate. sulphate distribution in cell compartments necessitates specific transport systems. the low-affinity sulphate transporters sultr4; <dig> and sultr4; <dig> have been localized to the vacuolar membrane, where they may facilitate sulphate efflux from the vacuole.


RESULTS
in the present study, we demonstrated that the sultr4; <dig> gene is expressed in developing arabidopsis seeds to a level over 10-fold higher than the sultr4; <dig> gene. a characterization of dry mature seeds from a sultr4; <dig> t-dna mutant revealed a higher sulphate content, implying a function for this transporter in developing seeds. a fine dissection of the sultr4; <dig> seed proteome identified  <dig> spots whose abundance varied compared to wild-type. specific metabolic features characteristic of an adaptive response were revealed, such as an up-accumulation of various proteins involved in sugar metabolism and in detoxification processes.


CONCLUSIONS
this study revealed a role for sultr4; <dig> in determining sulphate content of mature arabidopsis seeds. moreover, the adaptive response of sultr4; <dig> mutant seeds as revealed by proteomics suggests a function of sultr4; <dig> in redox homeostasis, a mechanism that has to be tightly controlled during development of orthodox seeds.
