BACKGROUND
male infertility is a major problem for mammalian reproduction. however, molecular details including the underlying mechanisms of male fertility are still not known. a thorough understanding of these mechanisms is essential for obtaining consistently high reproductive efficiency and to ensure lower cost and time-loss by breeder.


RESULTS
using high and low fertility bull spermatozoa, here we employed differential detergent fractionation multidimensional protein identification technology  and identified  <dig> putative biomarkers of fertility. we next used quantitative systems biology modeling and canonical protein interaction pathways and networks to show that high fertility spermatozoa differ from low fertility spermatozoa in four main ways. compared to sperm from low fertility bulls, sperm from high fertility bulls have higher expression of proteins involved in: energy metabolism, cell communication, spermatogenesis, and cell motility. our data also suggests a hypothesis that low fertility sperm dna integrity may be compromised because cell cycle: g2/m dna damage checkpoint regulation was most significant signaling pathway identified in low fertility spermatozoa.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first comprehensive description of the bovine spermatozoa proteome. comparative proteomic analysis of high fertility and low fertility bulls, in the context of protein interaction networks identified putative molecular markers associated with high fertility phenotype.
