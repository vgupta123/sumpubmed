BACKGROUND
some single nucleotide polymorphisms  are known to modify the risk of developing certain diseases or the reaction to drugs. due to next generation sequencing methods the number of known human snps has grown. not all snps lead to a modified protein, which may be the origin of a disease. therefore, the recognition of functional snps is needed. because most snp annotation tools look for snps which lead to an amino acid exchange or a premature stop, we designed a new tool called aassites which searches for snps which modify splicing.


RESULTS
aassites uses several gene prediction programs and open reading frame prediction to compare the wild type  and the variant gene sequence. the results of the comparison are combined by a handmade rule system to classify a change in splicing as “likely, probable, unlikely”. having received good results from tests with snps known for changing the splicing pattern we checked  <dig>  snps from the human genome which are located near splice sites for their ability to change the splicing pattern of the gene and hereby result in a different protein. we identified  <dig> “likely” and  <dig> “probable” classified snps with such characteristics. within this set  <dig> snps are described in the sssnp target database to cause modified splicing.


CONCLUSIONS
with aassites single snps can be checked for those causing splice modifications. screening  <dig>  known human snps we detected about  <dig>  snps which probably modify splicing. aassites is available at http://genius.embnet.dkfz-heidelberg.de/menu/biounit/open-husar using any web browser.
