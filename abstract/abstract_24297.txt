BACKGROUND
mixturetree v <dig>  is a linux based program  which implements an algorithm based on mixture models for reconstructing phylogeny from binary sequence data, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms . in addition to the mixture algorithm with three different optimization options, the program also implements a bootstrap procedure with majority-rule consensus.


RESULTS
the mixturetree program written in c++ is a linux based package. the user's guide and source codes will be available at http://math.asu.edu/~scchen/mixturetree.html


CONCLUSIONS
the efficiency of the mixture algorithm is relatively higher than some classical methods, such as neighbor-joining method, maximum parsimony method and maximum likelihood method. the shortcoming of the mixture tree algorithms, for example timing consuming, can be improved by implementing other revised expectation-maximization algorithms instead of the traditional em algorithm.
