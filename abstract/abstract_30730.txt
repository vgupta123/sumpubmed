BACKGROUND
the complex process of formation of storage roots  from adventitious roots affects sweetpotato yield. identifying the genes that are uniquely expressed in the sr forming cultivated species, ipomoea batatas , and its immediate ancestral species, ipomoea trifida , which does not form srs, may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying sr formation in sweetpotato.


RESULTS
illumina paired-end sequencing generated ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> million reads for ib and it, respectively. trinity assembly of the reads resulted in  <dig>  transcripts for ib and  <dig>  for it, after post-assembly removal of trans-chimeras. from these sequences, we identified  <dig>  orthologous genes in both ib and it,  <dig> paralogous genes in ib and  <dig>  paralogous genes in it. among paralogous gene sets, transcripts encoding the transcription factor rkd, which may have a role in nitrogen regulation and starch formation, and rhamnogalacturonate lyase  family proteins, which produce the precursors of cell wall polysaccharides, were found only in ib. in addition, transcripts encoding a k+ efflux antiporter  and the erecta protein kinase, which function in phytohormonal regulation and root proliferation, respectively, were also found only in ib. qrt-pcr indicated that starch and sucrose metabolism genes, such as those encoding adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase and beta-amylase, showed lower expression in it than ib, whereas lignin genes such as caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase  and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase  showed higher expression in it than ib. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique microsatellite markers,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  and  <dig>  and  <dig>  indels in ib and it, respectively, were also identified from this study.


CONCLUSIONS
the detection of genes involved in the biosynthesis of rgl family proteins, the transcription factor rkd, and genes encoding a k+ efflux antiporter  and the erecta protein kinase only in i. batatas indicate that these genes may have important functions in sr formation in sweetpotato. potential molecular markers  and sequences identified in this study may represent a valuable resource for sweetpotato gene annotation and may serve as important tools for improving sr formation in sweetpotato through breeding.
