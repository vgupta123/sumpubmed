BACKGROUND
chemokines and their receptors play a role in the innate immune response as well as in the disruption of the balance between pro-inflammatory th <dig> cells and regulatory t cells , underlying the pathogenesis of coronary vasculitis in kawasaki disease .


RESULTS
here we show that genetic inactivation of chemokine receptor - <dig> is protective against the induction of aortic and coronary vasculitis following injection of candida albicans water-soluble cell wall extracts . mechanistically, both t and b cells were required for the induction of vasculitis, a role that was directly modulated by ccr <dig>  caws administration promoted mobilization of ccr2-dependent inflammatory monocytes  from the bone marrow  to the periphery as well as production of il- <dig>  il- <dig> was likely to contribute to the depletion of treg and expansion of th <dig> cells in caws-injected ccr2+/+ mice, processes that were ameliorated following the genetic inactivation of ccr <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our findings provide novel insights into the role of ccr <dig> in the pathogenesis of vasculitis as seen in kd and highlight novel therapeutic targets, specifically for individuals resistant to first-line treatments.
