BACKGROUND
the fish-hunting cone snail, conus geographus, is the deadliest snail on earth. in the absence of medical intervention, 70% of human stinging cases are fatal. although, its venom is known to consist of a cocktail of small peptides targeting different ion-channels and receptors, the bulk of its venom constituents, their sites of manufacture, relative abundances and how they function collectively in envenomation has remained unknown.


RESULTS
we have used transcriptome sequencing to systematically elucidate the contents the c. geographus venom duct, dividing it into four segments in order to investigate each segmentâ€™s mrna contents. three different types of calcium channel  and at least two different nicotinic receptors appear to be targeted by the venom. moreover, the most highly expressed venom component is not paralytic, but causes sensory disorientation and is expressed in a different segment of the venom duct from venoms believed to cause sensory disruption. we have also identified several new toxins of interest for pharmaceutical and neuroscience research.


CONCLUSIONS
conus geographus is believed to prey on fish hiding in reef crevices at night. our data suggest that disorientation of prey is central to its envenomation strategy. furthermore, venom expression profiles also suggest a sophisticated layering of venom-expression patterns within the venom duct, with disorientating and paralytic venoms expressed in different regions. thus, our transcriptome analysis provides a new physiological framework for understanding the molecular envenomation strategy of this deadly snail.
