BACKGROUND
genome wide association study  has been proven to be a powerful tool for detecting genomic variants associated with complex traits. however, the specific genes and causal variants underlying these traits remain unclear.


RESULTS
here, we used target-enrichment strategy coupled with next generation sequencing technique to study target regions which were found to be associated with milk production traits in dairy cattle in our previous gwas. among the large amount of novel variants detected by targeted resequencing, we selected  <dig> snps for further association study in a population consisting of  <dig> cows. sixty six snps distributed in  <dig> genes were identified to be associated significantly with on milk production traits. of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> were consistent with our previous gwas results. we further chose  <dig> significant genes to analyze their mrna expression in different tissues of lactating cows, of which  <dig> were specificly highly expressed in mammary gland.


CONCLUSIONS
our study illustrates the potential for identifying causal mutations for milk production traits using target-enrichment resequencing and extends the results of gwas by discovering new and potentially functional mutations.
