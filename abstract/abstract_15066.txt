BACKGROUND
since upland cotton was introduced into china during the 1920s–1950s, hundreds of inbreed cultivars have been developed. to explore the molecular diversity, population structure and elite alleles,  <dig> inbred cultivars developed in china and some foreign cultivars from the united states and the soviet union were collected and analyzed by  <dig> genome-wide ssrs .

methods
four hundred and ninety-four pairs of ssrs with high polymorphism and uniform distribution on  <dig> chromosomes were used to scan polymorphisms in  <dig> nation-wide upland cottons. the programming language r was used to make boxplots for the phenotypic traits in different environments. molecular marker data and  <dig> fiber quality traits were analyzed by the method of mlm   in the tassel software package on the basis of the population structure and linkage disequilibrium analysis. the loci of elite allelic variation and typical materials carrying elite alleles were identified based on phenotypic effect values.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> markers were polymorphic and generated  <dig> allele loci; the population based on molecular diversity was classified into seven subpopulations corresponding to pedigree origin, ecological and geographical distribution. the attenuation distance of linkage disequilibrium dropped significantly up to 0–5 cm. association mapping for fiber quality showed that  <dig> marker loci were associated with fiber quality traits  explaining  <dig>  % ~  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variation, with an average of  <dig>  %. thirteen marker loci were coincident with other studies, and three were detected for the same trait. seven quantitative trait loci were related to known genes in fiber development. based on phenotypic effects,  <dig> typical materials that contained the elite allele loci related to fiber quality traits were identified and are widely used in practical breeding.


CONCLUSIONS
the molecular diversity and population structure of  <dig> nation-wide upland cottons in china were evaluated by  <dig> genome-wide ssrs, and association mapping for fiber quality revealed known and novel elite alleles. the molecular diversity provides a guide for parental mating in cotton breeding, and the association mapping results will aid in the fine-mapping genes related to fiber quality traits and facilitate further studies on candidate genes.
