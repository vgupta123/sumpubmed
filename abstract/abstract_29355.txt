BACKGROUND
our previous study suggested that seb exposure in pregnant rats could lead to the change of t cells subpopulation in both peripheral blood and thymus of the offspring rats. however, rarely is known about the influence of seb exposure in pregnant rats on t cell subpopulation in the spleens of offspring rats.


RESULTS
seb was intravenously administered to the pregnant rats at gestational day  <dig> in this study. the percentages, in vivo and in vitro responses of cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cells were investigated with flow cytometry. the prenatal seb exposure obviously increased splenic cd <dig> t cell percentages of both neonates and adult offspring rats, and obviously reduced splenic cd <dig> t cell percentages of both the fifth day neonates and adult offspring rats. after spleens in the adult offspring rats were re-stimulated with seb in vivo or in vitro, in vivo seb stimulation could lead to the marked decrease of splenic cd <dig> t cell percentage and the marked increase of splenic cd <dig> t cell percentage. while in vitro seb stimulation to the cultured splenocytes markedly decreased the proliferation of the splenic lymphocytes and the cd <dig> t cell percentage, and had no influence on cd <dig> t cell percentage.


CONCLUSIONS
the prenatal seb exposure could alter the percentages of cd4/cd <dig> t cell subpopulation and the response of cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cells to the in vivo and in vitro secondary seb stimulation in the splenocytes of adult offspring rats.
