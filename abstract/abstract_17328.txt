BACKGROUND
the development of high-throughput technologies such as yeast two-hybrid systems and mass spectrometry technologies has made it possible to generate large protein-protein interaction  datasets. mining these datasets for underlying biological knowledge has, however, remained a challenge.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> sequence signatures were found, each of which was shared by a set of guest proteins interacting with one of  <dig> host proteins in saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. approximately 94% of these sequence signatures matched entries in interpro member databases. we identified  <dig> distinct sequence signatures from the remaining  <dig> unknown signatures. the signature sharing information was then applied in predicting sub-cellular localization of yeast proteins and the novel signatures were used in identifying possible interacting sites.


CONCLUSIONS
we reported a method of ppi data mining that facilitated the discovery of novel sequence signatures using a large ppi dataset from s. cerevisiae genome as input. the fact that 94% of discovered signatures were known validated the ability of the approach to identify large numbers of signatures from ppi data. the significance of these discovered signatures was demonstrated by their application in predicting sub-cellular localizations and identifying potential interaction binding sites of yeast proteins.
