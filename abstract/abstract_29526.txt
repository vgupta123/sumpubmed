BACKGROUND
previously, we described the heat shock response in dipteran species belonging to the family stratiomyidae that develop in thermally and chemically contrasting habitats including highly aggressive ones. although all species studied exhibit high constitutive levels of hsp <dig> accompanied by exceptionally high thermotolerance, we also detected characteristic interspecies differences in heat shock protein  expression and survival after severe heat shock. here, we analyzed genomic libraries from two stratiomyidae species from thermally and chemically contrasting habitats and determined the structure and organization of their hsp <dig> clusters.


RESULTS
although the genomes of both species contain similar numbers of hsp <dig> genes, the spatial distribution of hsp <dig> copies differs characteristically. in a population of the eurytopic species stratiomys singularior, which exists in thermally variable and chemically aggressive  conditions, the hsp <dig> copies form a tight cluster with approximately equal intergenic distances. in contrast, in a population of the stenotopic oxycera pardalina that dwells in a stable cold spring, we did not find hsp <dig> copies in tandem orientation. in this species, the distance between individual hsp <dig> copies in the genome is very large, if they are linked at all. in o. pardalina we detected the hsp <dig> gene located next to a hsp <dig> copy in tandem orientation. although the hsp <dig> coding sequences of s. singularior are highly homogenized via conversion, the structure and general arrangement of the hsp <dig> clusters are highly polymorphic, including gross aberrations, various deletions in intergenic regions, and insertion of incomplete mariner transposons in close vicinity to the 3'-utrs.


CONCLUSIONS
the hsp <dig> gene families in s. singularior and o. pardalina evolved quite differently from one another. we demonstrated clear evidence of homogenizing gene conversion in the s. singularior hsp <dig> genes, which form tight clusters in this species. in the case of the other species, o. pardalina, we found no clear trace of concerted evolution for the dispersed hsp <dig> genes. furthermore, in the latter species we detected hsp <dig> pseudogenes, representing a hallmark of the birth-and-death process.
