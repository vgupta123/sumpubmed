BACKGROUND
trimester-specific reference ranges for t <dig>  t <dig>  and tsh need to be established in different communities. neither sudan nor other african countries have established trimester-specific reference ranges for tsh, free t <dig> , and free t <dig>  in healthy pregnant women. this study aimed to establish trimester-specific reference ranges for tsh, ft <dig>  and ft <dig> in healthy pregnant sudanese women.


RESULTS
we performed a longitudinal study, which included  <dig> women with singleton pregnancies who were followed since early pregnancy until the third trimester. the study was performed in saad abu-alela hospital, khartoum, sudan, during january to october  <dig>  an equal number of age- and parity-matched non-pregnant women were enrolled as a control group. basic clinical and obstetrics data were gathered using questionnaires. tsh, ft <dig>  and ft <dig> levels were measured. median  values of tsh, ft <dig>  and ft <dig> were  <dig>  iu/ml ,  <dig>  nmol/l , and  <dig>  pmol/l  in the first trimester. median values of tsh, ft <dig>  and ft <dig> were  <dig>  iu/ml ,  <dig>  nmol/l , and  <dig>  pmol/l  in the second trimester. these values were  <dig>  iu/ml ,  <dig>  nmol/l , and  <dig>  pmol/l  in the third trimester, respectively. tsh levels increased throughout the trimesters. ft <dig> and ft <dig> levels were significantly higher in the first trimester compared with the second and third trimesters. tsh, ft <dig>  and ft <dig> levels were significantly lower in pregnant women compared with non-pregnant women .


CONCLUSIONS
the present study is the first to establish trimester-specific reference ranges of tsh, ft <dig>  and ft <dig> in sudanese women with normal pregnancies. our results suggest that pregnancy is likely to suppress tsh, t <dig>  and t <dig> levels in healthy women.
