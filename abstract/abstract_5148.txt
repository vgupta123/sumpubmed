BACKGROUND
ethyl -4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyrate -chbe) is a versatile chiral precursor for many pharmaceuticals. although several biosynthesis strategies have been documented to convert ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate  to -chbe, the catalytic efficiency and stereoselectivity are still too low to be scaled up for industrial applications. due to the increasing demand of -chbe, it is essential to explore more robust biocatalyst capable of preparing -chbe efficiently.


RESULTS
a stereoselective carbonyl reductase toolbox was constructed and employed into the asymmetric reduction of cobe to -chbe. a robust enzyme designed as bgadh <dig> from burkholderia gladioli cctcc m  <dig> exhibited excellent activity and enantioselectivity, and was further characterized and investigated in the asymmetric synthesis of -chbe. an economical and satisfactory enzyme-coupled cofactor recycling system was created using recombinant escherichia coli cells co-expressing bgadh <dig> and glucose dehydrogenase genes to regenerate nadph in situ. in an aqueous/octanol biphasic system, as much as 1200 mmol cobe was completely converted by using substrate fed-batch strategy to afford -chbe with  <dig>  % ee at a space-time yield per gram of biomass of  <dig>  mmol∙l−1∙h−1∙g dcw− <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these data demonstrate the promising of bgadh <dig> in practical synthesis of -chbe as a valuable chiral synthon. this study allows for the further application of bgadh <dig> in the biosynthesis of chiral alcohols, and establishes a preparative scale process for producing -chbe with excellent enantiopurity.
