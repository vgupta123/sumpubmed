BACKGROUND
highly fecund mouse strains provide an ideal model to understand the factors affecting maternal performance. the qsi <dig> inbred strain of mice was selected for high fecundity and low inter-litter interval, and is very successful at weaning large numbers of offspring when compared to other inbred strains.


RESULTS
post-natal pup weight gain was used to estimate mammary gland output and to compare the performance of qsi <dig> mice to cba mice. cumulative litter weights and individual pup weight gain was significantly higher throughout the first eight days of lactation in qsi <dig> mice compared to cba mice. morphometric analysis of mammary glands during pregnancy in qsi <dig> mice revealed a  <dig> percent greater ductal side branching compared to cba mice . ontology and pathway classification of transcript profiles from the two strains identified an enrichment of genes involved in a number of pathways, including the mapk, tight junction, insulin signalling and wnt signalling. eleven of these genes, including six genes from the mapk signalling pathway, were identified as associated with postnatal growth. further, positive mediators of wnt signalling, including wnt <dig>  csnk2a <dig> and smad <dig>  were over-represented in the qsi <dig> strain profile, while negative regulators, including dkkl <dig>  ppp2r1a and nlk, were under-represented. these findings are consistent with the role of wnt and mapk signalling pathway in ductal morphogenesis and lobuloalveolar development suggesting enhanced activity in qsi <dig> mice. a similar pattern of phenotype concordance was seen amongst  <dig> genes from the tight junction pathway, but a pattern did not emerge from the insulin signalling genes. amongst a group of differentially expressed imprinted genes, two maternal imprinted genes that suppress growth induced via the igf signalling pathway, grb <dig> and igf2r, were under-represented in qsi <dig> mice. whereas peg <dig> and plagl <dig>  both paternally imprinted genes that enhance neonatal growth, were over-represented in qsi <dig> mice.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that the combined action of at least three major signalling pathways involved in mammary gland development and milk secretion, namely wnt, mapk and tight junction pathways, contribute to the superior maternal performance phenotype in qsi <dig> mice. additionally, favourable expression patterns of the imprinted genes peg <dig>  plagl <dig>  grb <dig> and igf2r may also contribute.
