BACKGROUND
chlamydophila  pneumoniae is an intracellular bacterium that has been identified within cells in areas of neuropathology found in alzheimer disease , including endothelia, glia, and neurons. depending on the cell type of the host, infection by c. pneumoniae has been shown to influence apoptotic pathways in both pro- and anti-apoptotic fashions. we have hypothesized that persistent chlamydial infection of neurons may be an important mediator of the characteristic neuropathology observed in ad brains. chronic and/or persistent infection of neuronal cells with c. pneumoniae in the ad brain may affect apoptosis in cells containing chlamydial inclusions.


RESULTS
sk-n-mc neuroblastoma cells were infected with the respiratory strain of c. pneumoniae, ar <dig> at an moi of  <dig>  following infection, the cells were either untreated or treated with staurosporine and then examined for apoptosis by labeling for nuclear fragmentation, caspase activity, and membrane inversion as indicated by annexin v staining. c. pneumoniae infection was maintained through  <dig> days post-infection. at  <dig> and  <dig> days post-infection, the infected cell cultures appeared to inhibit or were resistant to the apoptotic process when induced by staurosporine. this inhibition was demonstrated quantitatively by nuclear profile counts and caspase 3/ <dig> activity measurements.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that c. pneumoniae can sustain a chronic infection in neuronal cells by interfering with apoptosis, which may contribute to chronic inflammation in the ad brain.
