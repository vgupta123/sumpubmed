BACKGROUND
the use of food-grade lactic acid bacteria  as dna delivery vehicles represents an attractive strategy to deliver dna vaccines at the mucosal surfaces as they are generally regarded as safe . we previously showed that either native lactococcus lactis  or recombinant invasive ll expressing fibronectin binding protein a of staphylococcus aureus  or internalin a of listeria monocytogenes , were able to deliver and trigger dna expression by epithelial cells, either in vitro or in vivo. inla does not bind to its receptor, the murine e-cadherin, thus limiting the use of ll-inla+ in in vivo murine models. moreover, fnbpa binds to its receptors, integrins, via fibronectin introducing another limiting factor. in order to avoid the limitations of ll-inla+ and ll-fnbpa+, a new l. lactis strain was engineered to produce a previously described mutated form of inla  allowing the binding of minla on murine e-cadherin.


RESULTS
after showing the expression of minla at the surface of ll-minla+ strain, in vitro gentamycin survival assay in caco- <dig> cells showed that ll-minla+ is  <dig> times more invasive than ll. ll-minla+ invasivity was also validated by fluorescence microscopy. ll and ll-minla+ were transformed with pvalacblg, a plasmid containing the cdna of bovine Î²-lactoglobulin , resulting in strains ll-blg and ll-minla+blg. the plasmid transfer in vitro using ll-minla+blg was increased  <dig> times compared to ll-blg. moreover, the number of mice producing blg in isolated enterocytes after oral administration of ll-minla+blg in vivo was slightly higher than after oral administration of ll-blg.


CONCLUSIONS
we confirmed in this study that the production of minla at the surface of l. lactis is a promising strategy for plasmid transfer in vitro and in vivo.
