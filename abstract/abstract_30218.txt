BACKGROUND
fungi contaminate the food of humans and animals, are a risk to health, and can cause financial losses. in this work, the antifungal activities of  <dig> mesoionic compounds  were evaluated against mycotoxigenic fungi, including aspergillus spp., fusarium verticillioides and penicillium citrinum. furthermore, the decreased ergosterol in the total lipid content of fusarium verticillioides was investigated.


RESULTS
f. verticillioides was the most sensitive fungus to the mesoionic compounds. among the evaluated compounds, mi- <dig> and mi- <dig> presented higher antifungal effects against f. verticillioides, with mic values of  <dig>  μg/ml, and mi- <dig> and mi- <dig> followed, with mics of  <dig>  μg/ml. the most active compounds were those with heterocyclic ring phenyl groups substituted by electron donor moieties . among some compounds with higher activity , decreased ergosterol content in the total lipid fraction of f. verticillioides was demonstrated. mi- <dig> reduced the ergosterol content approximately 40% and 80% at concentrations of  <dig>  μg/ml and  <dig>  μg/ml, respectively, and mi- <dig> and mi- <dig> decreased the content by 30% and 50%, respectively, when at a concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings indicate that mesoionic compounds have significant antifungal activity against f. verticillioides.
