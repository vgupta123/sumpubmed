BACKGROUND
microarray comparative genomic hybridization  provides a means to examine dna copy number aberrations. various platforms, brands and underlying technologies are available, facing the user with many choices regarding platform sensitivity and number, localization, and density distribution of probes.


RESULTS
we evaluate three different platforms presenting different nature and arrangement of the probes: the agilent human genome cgh microarray  <dig> k, the roma/nimblegen representational oligonucleotide microarray  <dig> k, and the illumina human- <dig> genotyping  <dig> k beadchip, with agilent being gene oriented, roma/nimblegen being genome oriented, and illumina being genotyping oriented. we investigated copy number changes in  <dig> human breast tumor samples representing different gene expression subclasses, using a suite of graphical and statistical methods designed to work across platforms. despite substantial differences in the composition and spatial distribution of probes, the comparison revealed high overall concordance. notably however, some short amplifications and deletions of potential biological importance were not detected by all platforms. both correlation and cluster analysis indicate a somewhat higher similarity between roma/nimblegen and illumina than between agilent and the other two platforms. the programs developed for the analysis are available from .


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that platforms based on different technology principles reveal similar aberration patterns, although we observed some unique amplification or deletion peaks at various locations, only detected by one of the platforms. the correct platform choice for a particular study is dependent on whether the appointed research intention is gene, genome, or genotype oriented.
