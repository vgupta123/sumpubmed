BACKGROUND
our observation that in the mexican salmonella typhimurium population none of the st <dig> and st <dig> strains harbored both the salmonella virulence plasmid  and the prevalent inca/c plasmid  led us to hypothesize that restriction to horizontal transfer of these plasmids existed. we designed a conjugation scheme using st <dig> strain yu <dig> as donor of the blacmy- <dig> gene  carried by pa/c, and two e. coli lab strains  and two typhimurium st <dig> strains  carrying pstv as recipients. the aim of this study was to determine if the genetic background of the different recipient strains affected the transfer frequencies of pa/c.


RESULTS
yu <dig> was able to transfer cro resistance, via a novel conjugative mechanism, to all the recipient strains although at low frequencies . the presence of pstv in the recipients had little effect on the conjugation frequency. the analysis of the transconjugants showed that three different phenomena were occurring associated to the transfer of blacmy-2: 1) the co-integration of pa/c and px1; 2) the transposition of the cmy region from pa/c to px1; or 3) the rearrangement of pa/c. in addition, the co-lateral mobilization of a small  cole1-like plasmid was observed. the transconjugant plasmids involving px <dig> re-arrangements  obtained the capacity to conjugate at very high levels, similar to those found for px <dig> . two versions of the region containing blacmy- <dig> were found to transpose to px1: the large version was inserted into an intergenic region located where the “genetic load” operons are frequently inserted into px <dig>  while the short version was inserted into the stbde operon involved in plasmid addiction system. this is the first study to report the acquisition of an extended spectrum cephalosporin -resistance gene by an incx <dig> plasmid.


CONCLUSIONS
we showed that the transfer of the yu <dig> blacmy- <dig> gene harbored on a non- conjugative pa/c requires the machinery of a highly conjugative px <dig> plasmid. our experiments demonstrate the complex interactions a single strain can exploit to contend with the challenge of horizontal transfer and antibiotic selective pressure.
