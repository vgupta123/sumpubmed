BACKGROUND
rex <dig> and rex <dig> are protein components of the rna editing complex  and function as exouridylylases. the exact roles of rex <dig> and rex <dig> in the editosome are unclear and the consequences of the presence of two related proteins are not fully understood. here, a variety of computational studies were performed to enhance understanding of the structure and function of rex proteins in trypanosoma and leishmania species.


RESULTS
sequence analysis and homology modeling of the endonuclease/exonuclease/phosphatase  domain at the c-terminus of rex <dig> and rex <dig> highlights a common active site shared by all eep domains. phylogenetic analysis indicates that rex proteins contain a distinct subfamily of eep domains. inspection of three-dimensional models of the eep domain in trypanosoma brucei rex <dig> and rex <dig>  and leishmania major rex <dig> suggests variations of previously characterized key residues likely to be important in catalysis and determining substrate specificity.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified features of the rex eep domain that distinguish it from other family members and hence subfamily specific determinants of catalysis and substrate binding. the results provide specific guidance for experimental investigations about the role of rex proteins in rna editing.
