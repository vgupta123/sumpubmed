BACKGROUND
rna-seq is the recently developed high-throughput sequencing technology for profiling the entire transcriptome in any organism. it has several major advantages over current hybridization-based approach such as microarrays. however, the cost per sample by rna-seq is still prohibitive for most laboratories. with continued improvement in sequence output, it would be cost-effective if multiple samples are multiplexed and sequenced in a single lane with sufficient transcriptome coverage. the objective of this analysis is to evaluate what sequencing depth might be sufficient to interrogate gene expression profiling in the chicken by rna-seq.


RESULTS
two cdna libraries from chicken lungs were sequenced initially, and  <dig>  million  and  <dig>  m  reads were generated, respectively. with significant improvements in sequencing technology, two technical replicate cdna libraries were re-sequenced. totals of  <dig>  m and  <dig>  m  reads were obtained with the two samples. more than 90% of annotated genes were detected in the data sets with  <dig> - <dig>  m reads, while only 68% of genes were detected in the data set with  <dig>  m reads. the correlation coefficients of gene expression between technical replicates within the same sample were  <dig>  and  <dig> . to evaluate the appropriate depth needed for mrna profiling, a random sampling method was used to generate different number of reads from each sample. there was a significant increase in correlation coefficients from a sequencing depth of  <dig>  m to  <dig> m for all genes except highly abundant genes. no significant improvement was observed from the depth of  <dig> m to  <dig> m  reads.


CONCLUSIONS
the analysis from the current study demonstrated that  <dig> m  reads is sufficient to detect all annotated genes in chicken lungs. ten million  reads could detect about 80% of annotated chicken genes, and rna-seq at this depth can serve as a replacement of microarray technology. furthermore, the depth of sequencing had a significant impact on measuring gene expression of low abundant genes. finally, the combination of experimental and simulation approaches is a powerful approach to address the relationship between the depth of sequencing and transcriptome coverage.
