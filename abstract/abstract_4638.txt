BACKGROUND
enterocin a is a classic iia bacteriocin isolated firstly from enterococcus faecium ctc <dig> with selective antimicrobial activity against listeria strains. however, the application of enterocin a as an anti-listeria agent has been limited due to its very low native yield. the present work describes high production of enterocin a through codon optimization strategy and its character study.


RESULTS
the gene sequence of enterocin a was optimized based on preferential codon usage in pichia pastoris to increase its expression efficiency. the highest anti-listeria activity reached  <dig>  au/ml from 180 mg/l of total protein after 24 h of induction in a 5-l fermenter. recombinant enterocin a , purified by gel filtration chromatography, showed very strong activity against listeria ivanovii atcc  <dig> with a low mic of 20 ng/ml. in addition, the renta killed over 99% of tested l. ivanovii atcc <dig> within 4 h when exposed to 4 × mic . moreover, it showed high stability under a wide ph range  and maintained full activity after 1 h of treatment at 80°c within a ph range of 2– <dig>  its antimicrobial activity was enhanced at  <dig> and 50 mm nacl, while 100–400 mm nacl had little effect on the bactericidal ability of renta.


CONCLUSIONS
the enta was successfully expressed in p. pastoris, and this feasible system could pave the pre-industrial technological path of renta as a competent candidate as an anti-listeria agent. furthermore, it showed high stability under wide ranges of conditions, which could be potential as the new candidate of anti-listeria agent.
