BACKGROUND
long alpha-helical coiled-coil proteins are involved in diverse organizational and regulatory processes in eukaryotic cells. they provide cables and networks in the cyto- and nucleoskeleton, molecular scaffolds that organize membrane systems and tissues, motors, levers, rotating arms, and possibly springs. mutations in long coiled-coil proteins have been implemented in a growing number of human diseases. using the coiled-coil prediction program multicoil, we have previously identified all long coiled-coil proteins from the model plant arabidopsis thaliana and have established a searchable arabidopsis coiled-coil protein database.


RESULTS
here, we have identified all proteins with long coiled-coil domains from  <dig> additional fully sequenced genomes. because regions predicted to form coiled-coils interfere with sequence homology determination, we have developed a sequence comparison and clustering strategy based on masking predicted coiled-coil domains. comparing and grouping all long coiled-coil proteins from  <dig> genomes, the kingdom-specificity of coiled-coil protein families was determined. at the same time, a number of proteins with unknown function could be grouped with already characterized proteins from other organisms.


CONCLUSIONS
multicoil predicts proteins with extended coiled-coil domains  to be largely absent from bacterial genomes, but present in archaea and eukaryotes. the structural maintenance of chromosomes proteins and their relatives are the only long coiled-coil protein family clearly conserved throughout all kingdoms, indicating their ancient nature. motor proteins, membrane tethering and vesicle transport proteins are the dominant eukaryote-specific long coiled-coil proteins, suggesting that coiled-coil proteins have gained functions in the increasingly complex processes of subcellular infrastructure maintenance and trafficking control of the eukaryotic cell.
