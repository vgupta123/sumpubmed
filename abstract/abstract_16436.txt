BACKGROUND
due to the paucity of novel antibiotics, colistin has become a last resort antibiotic for treating multidrug resistant bacteria. colistin acts by binding the lipid a component of lipopolysaccharides and subsequently disrupting the bacterial membrane. the recently identified plasmid-encoded mcr- <dig> enzyme is the first transmissible colistin resistance determinant and is a cause for concern for the spread of this resistance trait. mcr- <dig> is a phosphoethanolamine transferase that catalyzes the addition of phosphoethanolamine to lipid a to decrease colistin affinity.


RESULTS
the structure of the catalytic domain of mcr- <dig> at  <dig>  Å reveals the active site is similar to that of related phosphoethanolamine transferases.


CONCLUSIONS
the putative nucleophile for catalysis, threonine  <dig>  is phosphorylated in cmcr- <dig> and a zinc is present at a conserved site in addition to three zincs more peripherally located in the active site. as noted for catalytic domains of other phosphoethanolamine transferases, binding sites for the lipid a and phosphatidylethanolamine substrates are not apparent in the cmcr- <dig> structure, suggesting that they are present in the membrane domain.
