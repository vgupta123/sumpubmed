BACKGROUND
phylogenetic group d escherichia coli clones  are increasingly reported as multidrug resistant strains causing extra-intestinal infections. we aim to characterize inter- and intraclonal diversity of a broad sample  and their ability to adhere and form biofilm by both a modified quantitative biofilm producing assay and field emission scanning electron microscopy .


RESULTS
high virulence scores were observed among st <dig>  and st <dig>  clones, particularly enriched in pap alleles, iha, kpsmtii-k <dig> and ompt, in contrast with st <dig>  isolates, exhibiting frequently fyua, malx and trat. all st <dig> and st <dig> and only two st <dig> isolates were classified as expec. biofilm production was detected in two non-clinical st <dig> and three st <dig> isolates from different origins showing variable virulence profiles. within each clonal group, and despite the high diversity of pfge-types observed, isolates from different countries and recovered over large periods of time were clustered in a few groups sharing common virulence gene profiles among st <dig>  and st <dig>  -sat--papa-papef-papgii-papc) or st <dig>  .


CONCLUSIONS
this study highlights the circulation of highly transmissible st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> variants among different settings. biofilm production seems not to be directly correlated with their epidemiological success.
