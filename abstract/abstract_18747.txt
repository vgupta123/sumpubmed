BACKGROUND
laser microdissection allows precise isolation of specific cell types and compartments from complex tissues. to analyse proteins from small cell numbers, we combine laser-microdissection and manipulation  with mass spectrometry techniques.


RESULTS
hemalaun stained mouse lung sections were used to isolate 500– <dig>  cells, enough material for complex protein profiles by seldi-tof ms , employing different chromatographic proteinchip® arrays. initially, to establish the principle, we identified specific protein peaks from  <dig>  laser-microdissected cells, combining column chromatography, sds-page, tryptic digestion, seldi technology and tandem ms/ms using a proteinchip® tandem ms interface. secondly, our aim was to reduce the labour requirements of microdissecting several thousand cells. therefore, we first defined target proteins in a few microdissected cells, then recovered in whole tissue section homogenates from the same lung and applied to these analytical techniques. both approaches resulted in a successful identification of the selected peaks.


CONCLUSIONS
laser-microdissection may thus be combined with seldi-tof ms for generation of protein marker profiles in a cell-type- or compartment-specific manner in complex tissues, linked with mass fingerprinting and peptide sequencing by tandem ms/ms for definite characterization.
