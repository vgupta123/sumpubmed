BACKGROUND
the accurate normalization of differentially expressed genes in lung cancer is essential for the identification of novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers by real time rt-pcr and microarrays. although classical "housekeeping" genes, such as gapdh, hprt <dig>  and beta-actin have been widely used in the past, their accuracy as reference genes for lung tissues has not been proven.


RESULTS
we have conducted a thorough analysis of a panel of  <dig> candidate reference genes for lung specimens and lung cell lines. gene expression was measured by quantitative real time rt-pcr and expression stability was analyzed with the softwares genorm and normfinder, mean of |Δct|  ± sem, and correlation coefficients among genes. systematic comparison between candidates led us to the identification of a subset of suitable reference genes for clinical samples: ipo <dig>  actb, polr2a, 18s, and ppia. further analysis showed that ipo <dig> had a very low mean of |Δct| , with no statistically significant differences between normal and malignant samples and with excellent expression stability.


CONCLUSIONS
our data show that ipo <dig> is the most accurate reference gene for clinical lung specimens. in addition, we demonstrate that the commonly used genes gapdh and hprt <dig> are inappropriate to normalize data derived from lung biopsies, although they are suitable as reference genes for lung cell lines. we thus propose ipo <dig> as a novel reference gene for lung cancer samples.
