BACKGROUND
the engrailed homology  <dig>  motif is a small region, believed to have evolved convergently in homeobox and forkhead containing proteins, that interacts with the drosophila protein groucho . the small size of the motif makes its reliable identification by computational means difficult. i have systematically searched the predicted proteomes of drosophila, c. elegans and human for further instances of the motif.


RESULTS
using motif identification methods and database searching techniques, i delimit which homeobox and forkhead domain containing proteins also have likely eh <dig> motifs. i show that despite low database search scores, there is a significant association of the motif with transcription factor function. i further show that likely eh <dig> motifs are found in combination with t-box, zinc finger and doublesex domains as well as discussing other plausible candidate associations. i identify strong candidate eh <dig> motifs in basal metazoan phyla.


CONCLUSIONS
candidate eh <dig> motifs exist in combination with a variety of transcription factor domains, suggesting that these proteins have repressor functions. the distribution of the eh <dig> motif is suggestive of convergent evolution, although in many cases, the motif has been conserved throughout bilaterian orthologs. groucho mediated repression was established prior to the evolution of bilateria.
