BACKGROUND
the transcriptional activity of nuclear hormone receptors  is regulated by interaction with coactivator or corepressor proteins. many of these cofactors have been shown to have a misregulated expression or to show a subcellular mislocalization in cancer cell lines or primary tumors. therefore they can be factors involved in the process of oncogenesis.


RESULTS
we describe a novel nr coregulator, tacc <dig>  which belongs to the transforming acidic coiled coil  family. the interaction of tacc <dig> with thyroid hormone receptors  and several other nrs has been shown in a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed by gst pulldown, colocalization and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. tacc <dig> interacts preferentially with unliganded nrs. in f <dig> cells, endogenous tacc <dig> localized in the chromatin-enriched fraction of the nucleus and interacted with retinoid acid receptors  in the nucleus. tacc <dig> depletion in the cell led to decreased rarα and trα ligand-dependent transcriptional activity and to delocalization of tr from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.


CONCLUSIONS
from these experimental studies we propose that tacc <dig> might be a scaffold protein building up a transcriptional complex around the nrs we studied. this function of tacc <dig> might account for its involvement in several forms of tumour development.
