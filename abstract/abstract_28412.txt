BACKGROUND
'selection signatures' delimit regions of the genome that are, or have been, functionally important and have therefore been under either natural or artificial selection. in this study, two different and complementary methods--integrated haplotype homozygosity score  and population differentiation index --were applied to identify traces of decades of intensive artificial selection for traits of economic importance in modern cattle.


RESULTS
we scanned the genome of a diverse set of dairy and beef breeds from germany, canada and australia genotyped with a  <dig> k snp panel. across breeds, a total of  <dig> extreme |ihs| values exceeded the empirical threshold level of 5% with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> outliers in holstein, brown swiss, australian angus, hereford and simmental, respectively. annotating the regions harboring clustered |ihs| signals revealed a panel of interesting candidate genes like spata <dig>  mgat <dig>  pgrmc <dig> and actc <dig>  col23a <dig>  matn <dig>  respectively, in the context of reproduction and muscle formation. in a further step, a new bayesian fst-based approach was applied with a set of geographically separated populations including holstein, brown swiss, simmental, north american angus and piedmontese for detecting differentiated loci. in total,  <dig> regions exceeding the  <dig>  per cent threshold of the empirical posterior distribution were identified as extremely differentiated. in a substantial number  the extreme fst values were found to be positioned in poor gene content regions which deviated significantly  from the expectation assuming a random distribution. however, significant fst values were found in regions of some relevant genes such as smcp and fgf <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
overall,  <dig> regions putatively subject to recent positive selection in the cattle genome were detected. both |ihs| and fst suggested selection in the vicinity of the sialic acid binding ig-like lectin  <dig> gene on bta <dig>  this region was recently reported to be a major qtl with strong effects on productive life and fertility traits in holstein cattle. we conclude that high-resolution genome scans of selection signatures can be used to identify genomic regions contributing to within- and inter-breed phenotypic variation.
