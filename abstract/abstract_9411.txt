BACKGROUND
major changes in climate have been observed in the arctic and climate models predict further amplification of the enhanced greenhouse effect at high-latitudes leading to increased warming. we propose that warming in the arctic may affect the annual growth conditions of the cold adapted arctic charr and that such effects can already be detected retrospectrally using otolith data.


RESULTS
inter-annual growth of the circumpolar arctic charr  was analysed in relation to climatic changes observed in the arctic during the last two decades. arctic charr were sampled from six locations at qeqertarsuaq in west greenland, where climate data have been recorded since  <dig>  two fish populations met the criteria of homogeny and, consequently, only these were used in further analyses. the results demonstrate a complex coupling between annual growth rates and fluctuations in annual mean temperatures and precipitation. significant changes in temporal patterns of growth were observed between cohorts of  <dig> and  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
differences in pattern of growth appear to be a consequence of climatic changes over the last two decades and we thereby conclude that climatic affects short term and inter-annual growth as well as influencing long term shifts in age-specific growth patterns in population of arctic charr.
