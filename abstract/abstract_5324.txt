BACKGROUND
genome- and population-wide re-sequencing would allow for most efficient detection of causal trait variants. however, despite a strong decrease of costs for next-generation sequencing in the last few years, re-sequencing of large numbers of individuals is not yet affordable. we therefore resorted to re-sequencing of a limited number of bovine animals selected to explain a major proportion of the population's genomic variation, so called key animals, in order to provide a catalogue of functional variants and a substrate for population- and genome-wide imputation of variable sites.


RESULTS
forty-three animals accounting for about  <dig> percent of the genetic diversity of the fleckvieh population, a cattle breed of southern germany and austria, were sequenced with coverages ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and averaging  <dig> . after alignment to the reference genome  and multi-sample variant calling, more than  <dig> million variant positions were identified, about  <dig> percent biallelic single nucleotide variants  and  <dig> percent short insertions and deletions . the comparison with high-density chip data revealed a sensitivity of at least  <dig> percent and a specificity of  <dig> percent for sequencing based genotyping, and  <dig> percent and  <dig> percent when a imputation step was included. there are  <dig>  variants in coding regions of  <dig>  genes,  <dig> percent being non-synonymous exchanges, of which  <dig> variants are predicted to cause premature stop codons. three variants are listed in the omia database as causal for specific phenotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
low- to medium-coverage re-sequencing of individuals explaining a major fraction of a population's genomic variation allows for the efficient and reliable detection of most variants. imputation strongly improves genotype quality of lowly covered samples and thus enables maximum density genotyping by sequencing. the functional annotation of variants provides the basis for exhaustive genotype imputation in the population, e.g., for highest-resolution genome-wide association studies.
