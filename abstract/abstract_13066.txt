BACKGROUND
maize  is one of the most important cereal crops worldwide and provides food for billions of people. stalk lodging can greatly undermine the standability of maize plants and therefore decrease crop yields. rind penetrometer resistance is an effective and reliable method for evaluating maize stalk strength, which is highly correlated with stalk lodging resistance. in this study, two recombinant inbred line populations were constructed from crosses between the h127r and chang7- <dig> lines, and between the b <dig> and by <dig> lines. we genotyped these two populations and their parents using  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphism markers and performed phenotypic assessment of rind penetrometer resistance in multiple environments to dissect the genetic architecture of rind penetrometer resistance in maize.


RESULTS
based on two linkage maps of  <dig> . <dig> and  <dig> .4 cm with average interval of  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm between adjacent makers, respectively, seven quantitative trait loci  for rind penetrometer resistance were detected in the two recombinant inbred line populations. these qtl were distributed in seven genomic regions, and each accounted for  <dig> – <dig> % of the rind penetrometer resistance variation. the qtl with the largest effect on rind penetrometer resistance, qrpr3- <dig>  was located on chromosome  <dig> with the flanking markers pze- <dig> and syn <dig>  this locus was further narrowed down to a  <dig> -mb interval by haplotype analysis using high-density markers in the target region. within this interval, four genes associated with the biosynthesis of cell wall components were considered as potential candidate genes for the rind penetrometer resistance effect.


CONCLUSIONS
the inheritance of rind penetrometer resistance is rather complex. a few large-effect quantitative trait loci, together with a several minor-effect qtl, contributed to the phenotypic variation in rind penetrometer resistance in the two recombinant inbred line populations that were examined. a potential approach for improving stalk strength and crop yields in commercial maize lines may be to introgress favorable alleles of the locus that was found to have the largest effect on rind penetrometer resistance .
