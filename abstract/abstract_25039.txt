BACKGROUND
picrotoxin blocks gabaa receptors, whose activation typically inhibits neuronal firing activity. we recently found that rats learn to selectively self-administer picrotoxin or bicuculline, another gabaa receptor antagonist, into the supramammillary nucleus , a posterior hypothalamic structure localized anterior to the ventral tegmental area. other drugs such as nicotine or the excitatory amino acid ampa are also self-administered into the sum. the sum appears to be functionally linked with the mesolimbic dopamine system and is closely connected with other brain structures that are implicated in motivational processes, including the prefrontal cortex, septal area, preoptic area, lateral hypothalamic area and dorsal raphe nucleus. here, we hypothesized that these brain structures are activated by picrotoxin injections into the sum.


RESULTS
picrotoxin administration into the sum markedly facilitated locomotion and rearing. further, it increased c-fos expression in this region, suggesting blockade of tonic inhibition and thus the disinhibition of local neurons. this manipulation also increased c-fos expression in structures including the ventral tegmental area, medial shell of the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, septal area, preoptic area, lateral hypothalamic area and dorsal raphe nucleus.


CONCLUSIONS
picrotoxin administration into the sum appears to disinhibit local neurons and recruits activation of brain structures associated with motivational processes, including the mesolimbic dopamine system, prefrontal cortex, septal area, preoptic area, lateral hypothalamic area and dorsal raphe nucleus. these regions may be involved in mediating positive motivational effects triggered by intra-sum picrotoxin.
