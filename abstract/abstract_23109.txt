BACKGROUND
the gilthead sea bream  occurs around the mediterranean and along eastern atlantic coasts from great britain to senegal. it is tolerant of a wide range of temperatures and salinities and is often found in brackish coastal lagoons and estuarine areas, particularly early in its life cycle. gilthead sea bream are extensively cultivated in the mediterranean with an annual production of  <dig>  metric tonnes. here we present a de novo assembly of the fast skeletal muscle transcriptome of gilthead sea bream using  <dig> reads and identify gene paralogues, splice variants and microsatellite repeats. an annotated transcriptome of the skeletal muscle will facilitate understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of traits linked to production in this economically important species.


RESULTS
around  <dig>  million reads of mrna sequence data were generated from the fast myotomal of adult fish  and juvenile fish  that had been either fed to satiation, fasted for 3-5d or transferred to low  or high  temperatures for 3-5d. newbler v <dig>  assembly resulted in  <dig>  isotigs >100 bp. the number of sequences annotated by searching protein and gene ontology databases was  <dig> . the average coverage of the annotated isotigs was x <dig> containing  <dig> unique gene ids and  <dig> full-length cdnas coding for proteins containing 58– <dig> amino acids. the v <dig>  assembly was found to be of good quality based on validation using  <dig> full-length cdnas from genbank. annotated isotigs from the reference transcriptome were attributable to  <dig> kegg pathway maps. we identified  <dig> gene paralogues  and  <dig> splice variants, of which  <dig> had functional domains missing that were likely to affect their biological function. many key transcription factors, signaling molecules and structural proteins necessary for myogenesis and muscle growth have been identified. physiological status affected the number of reads that mapped to isotigs, reflecting changes in gene expression between treatments.


CONCLUSIONS
we have produced a comprehensive fast skeletal muscle transcriptome for the gilthead sea bream, which will provide a resource for snp discovery in genes with a large effect on production traits of commercial interest and for expression studies of growth and adaptation.
