BACKGROUND
to initiate mucosal immune responses, antigens in the intestinal lumen must be transported into gut-associated lymphoid tissue through m cells. recently, it has been increasingly recognized that receptor activator of nf-kb ligand  controls m cell differentiation by interacting with rank expressed on the sub-epithelium of peyer’s patches. in this study, we increased the number of m cells using soluble rankl  as a potent mucosal adjuvant.


RESULTS
for efficient oral delivery of srankl, we constructed recombinant lactococcus lactis  il <dig> secreting srankl . the biological activity of recombinant srankl was confirmed by observing rank-rankl signaling in vitro. m cell development in response to oral administration of recombinant l. lactis was determined by  <dig> -fold higher immunohistochemical expression of m cell marker gp- <dig>  compared to that of non-treatment group. in addition, an adjuvant effect of srankl was examined by immunization of mice with m-bmpb as a model antigen after treatment with srankl-lab. compared with the wild-type l. lactis group, the srankl-lab group showed significantly increased systemic and mucosal immune responses specific to m-bmpb.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the m cell development by srankl-lab can increase the antigen transcytotic capability of follicle-associated epithelium, and thereby enhance the mucosal immune response, which implies that oral administration of srankl is a promising adjuvant strategy for efficient oral vaccination.
