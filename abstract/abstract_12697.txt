BACKGROUND
the ability to recreate an optimal cellular microenvironment is critical to understand neuronal behavior and functionality in vitro. an organized neural extracellular matrix  promotes neural cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. here, we expanded previous observations on the ability of necm to support in vitro neuronal differentiation, with the following goals:  to recreate complex neuronal networks of embryonic rat hippocampal cells, and  to achieve improved levels of dopaminergic differentiation of subventricular zone  neural progenitor cells.

methods
hippocampal cells from e <dig> rat embryos were seeded on pll- and necm-coated substrates. neurosphere cultures were prepared from the svz of p4-p <dig> rat pups, and differentiation of neurospheres assayed on pll- and necm-coated substrates.


RESULTS
when seeded on necm-coated substrates, both hippocampal cells and svz progenitor cells showed neural expression patterns that were similar to their poly-l-lysine-seeded counterparts. however, necm-based cultures of both hippocampal neurons and svz progenitor cells could be maintained for longer times as compared to poly-l-lysine-based cultures. as a result, necm-based cultures gave rise to a more branched neurite arborization of hippocampal neurons. interestingly, the prolonged differentiation time of svz progenitor cells in necm allowed us to obtain a purer population of dopaminergic neurons.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that necm-based coating is an efficient substrate to culture neural cells at different stages of differentiation. in addition, neural ecm-coated substrates increased neuronal survival and neuronal differentiation efficiency as compared to cationic polymers such as poly-l-lysine.
