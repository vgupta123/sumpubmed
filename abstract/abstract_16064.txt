BACKGROUND
short dimeric or mulitmeric peptides derived from a highly conserved stretch of amino acids from gammaretroviral envelope proteins has been found to have immunosuppressive properties in vitro. here we test the hypothesis that such immunosuppressive peptides may serve as immunomodulatory reagents for treatment of inflammatory disorders.


RESULTS
the anti-inflammatory effect of a synthetic retrovirus-derived immunosuppressive peptide of  <dig> amino acids was tested in two murine skin inflammation models, a tpa-induced acute toxic contact eczema model and an oxazolone-induced allergic contact dermatitis. overall, mice  treated with a topically applied cream containing the dimeric immunosuppressive peptide exhibited a reduction of  <dig> % in ear thickness , whereas the application of a scrambled peptide dimer or a monomer of the immunosuppressive peptide remained without effect . furthermore, ear biopsies from mice treated with the dimeric immunosuppressive peptide showed a significant reduction in mrna of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf-Î±, il-17c, and il- <dig> as well as the chemokine cxcl <dig> compared to mice treated with control peptides.


CONCLUSIONS
using two murine skin inflammation models, we show that an immunosuppressive retroviral peptide is capable of reducing inflammatory disorders. the results indicate that virus-derived immunosuppressive peptides capable of down-regulating several proinflammatory cytokines may represent a novel class of drugs for the treatment of excess inflammation.
