BACKGROUND
understanding how species-specific micrornas  contribute to species-specific phenotypes is a central topic in biology. this study aimed to elucidate the role of ruminant-specific mirnas in shaping mrna expression divergence between ruminant and non-ruminant species.


RESULTS
we analyzed mirna and mrna transcriptomes generated by illumina sequencing from whole blood samples of cattle and a closely related non-ruminant species, pig. we found evidence of expansion of cattle-specific mirnas by analyzing mirna conservation among  <dig> vertebrate species. the emergence of cattle-specific mirnas was accompanied by accelerated sequence evolution at their target sites. further, the target genes of cattle-specific mirnas show markedly reduced expression compared to their pig and human orthologues. we found that target genes with conserved or non-conserved target sites of cattle-specific mirnas exhibit reduced expression. one of the significantly enriched kegg pathway terms for the target genes of the cattle-specific mirnas is the insulin signalling pathway, raising the possibility that some of these mirnas may modulate insulin resistance in ruminants.


CONCLUSIONS
we provide evidence of rapid mirna-mediated regulatory evolution in the ruminant lineage. cattle-specific mirnas play an important role in shaping gene expression divergence between ruminant and non-ruminant species, by influencing the expression of targets genes through both conserved and cattle-specific target sites.
