BACKGROUND
to understand the energetics of the interaction between protein and dna we analyzed  <dig> crystallographically characterized complexes with the hint  computational model. hint is an empirical free energy force field based on solvent partitioning of small molecules between water and 1-octanol. our previous studies on protein-ligand complexes demonstrated that free energy predictions were significantly improved by taking into account the energetic contribution of water molecules that form at least one hydrogen bond with each interacting species.


RESULTS
an initial correlation between the calculated hint scores and the experimentally determined binding free energies in the protein-dna system exhibited a relatively poor r <dig> of  <dig>  and standard error of ±  <dig>  kcal mol- <dig>  however, the inclusion of  <dig> waters that bridge protein and dna improved the hint score-free energy correlation to an r <dig> of  <dig>  and standard error of ±  <dig>  kcal mol- <dig>  analysis of the water role and energy contributions indicate that 46% of the bridging waters act as linkers between amino acids and nucleotide bases at the protein-dna interface, while the remaining 54% are largely involved in screening unfavorable electrostatic contacts.


CONCLUSIONS
this study quantifies the key energetic role of bridging waters in protein-dna associations. in addition, the relevant role of hydrophobic interactions and entropy in driving protein-dna association is indicated by analyses of interaction character showing that, together, the favorable polar and unfavorable polar/hydrophobic-polar interactions  mostly cancel.
