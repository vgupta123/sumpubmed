BACKGROUND
teleost radiation in the oceans required specific physiological adaptations in eggs and early embryos to survive in the hyper-osmotic seawater. investigating the evolution of aquaporins  in these vertebrates should help to elucidate how mechanisms for water homeostasis evolved. the marine teleost gilthead sea bream  has a mammalian aquaporin- <dig> -related channel, termed aqp1o, with a specialized physiological role in mediating egg hydration. however, teleosts have an additional aqp isoform structurally more similar to aqp <dig>  though its relationship with aqp1o is unclear.


RESULTS
by using phylogenetic and genomic analyses we show here that teleosts, unlike tetrapods, have two closely linked aqp <dig> paralogous genes, termed aqp1a and aqp1b . in marine teleosts that produce hydrated eggs, aqp1b is highly expressed in the ovary, whereas in freshwater species that produce non-hydrated eggs, aqp1b has a completely different expression pattern or is not found in the genome. both aqp1a and aqp1b are functional water-selective channels when expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes. however, expression of chimeric and mutated proteins in oocytes revealed that the sea bream aqp1b c-terminus, unlike that of aqp1a, contains specific residues involved in the control of aqp1b intracellular trafficking through phosphorylation-independent and -dependent mechanisms.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that 1) aqp1a and aqp1b are encoded by distinct genes that probably originated specifically in the teleost lineage by duplication of a common ancestor soon after divergence from tetrapods, 2) aqp1b possibly represents a neofunctionalized aqp adapted to oocytes of marine and catadromous teleosts, thereby contributing to a water reservoir in eggs and early embryos that increases their survival in the ocean, and 3) aqp1b independently acquired regulatory domains in the cytoplasmatic c-terminal tail for the specific control of aqp1b expression in the plasma membrane.
