BACKGROUND
the ap2/erf protein family contains transcription factors that play a crucial role in plant growth and development and in response to biotic and abiotic stress conditions in plants. grapevine  is the only woody crop whose genome has been fully sequenced. so far, no detailed expression profile of ap2/erf-like genes is available for grapevine.


RESULTS
an exhaustive search for ap2/erf genes was carried out on the vitis vinifera genome and their expression profile was analyzed by real-time quantitative pcr  in different vegetative and reproductive tissues and under two different ripening stages.

one hundred and forty nine sequences, containing at least one erf domain, were identified. specific clusters within the ap <dig> and erf families showed conserved expression patterns reminiscent of other species and grapevine specific trends related to berry ripening. moreover, putative targets of group ix erfs were identified by co-expression and protein similarity comparisons.


CONCLUSIONS
the grapevine genome contains an amount of ap2/erf genes comparable to that of other dicot species analyzed so far. we observed an increase in the size of specific groups within the erf family, probably due to recent duplication events. expression analyses in different aerial tissues display common features previously described in other plant systems and introduce possible new roles for members of some erf groups during fruit ripening. the presented analysis of ap2/erf genes in grapevine provides the bases for studying the molecular regulation of berry development and the ripening process.
