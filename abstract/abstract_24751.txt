BACKGROUND
emotion-related attentional bias is implicated in the aetiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders. electroencephalogram  biofeedback can obviously improve the anxiety disorders and reduce stress level, and can also enhance attention performance in healthy subjects. the present study examined the effects and mechanisms of eeg biofeedback training on the attentional bias of high trait anxiety  individuals toward negative stimuli.


RESULTS
event-related potentials were recorded while hta  and nonanxious  individuals performed the color-word emotional stroop task. during the emotional stroop task, hta participants showed longer reaction times and p <dig> latencies induced by negative words, compared to nonanxious participants.

the eeg biofeedback significantly decreased the trait anxiety inventory score and reaction time in naming the color of negative words in the hta group. p <dig> latencies evoked by negative stimuli in the eeg biofeedback group were significantly reduced after the alpha training, while no significant changes were observed in the sham biofeedback group after the intervention.


CONCLUSIONS
the prolonged p <dig> latency is associated with attentional bias to negative stimuli in the hta group. eeg biofeedback training demonstrated a significant improvement of negative emotional attentional bias in hta individuals, which may be due to the normalization of p <dig> latency.
