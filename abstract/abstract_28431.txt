BACKGROUND
trichoderma reesei is used for industry-scale production of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, in particular cellulases, but also xylanases. the expression of the encoding genes was so far primarily investigated on the level of transcriptional regulation by regulatory proteins. otherwise, the impact of chromatin remodelling on gene expression received hardly any attention. in this study we aimed to learn if the chromatin status changes in context to the applied conditions , and if the presence or absence of the essential transactivator, the xylanase regulator  <dig> , influences the chromatin packaging.


RESULTS
comparing the results of chromatin accessibility real-time pcr analyses and gene expression studies of the two prominent cellulase-encoding genes, cbh <dig> and cbh <dig>  we found that the chromatin opens during sophorose-mediated induction compared to d-glucose-conferred repression. in the strain bearing a xyr <dig> deletion the sophorose mediated induction of gene expression is lost and the chromatin opening is strongly reduced. in all conditions the chromatin got denser when xyr <dig> is absent. in the case of the xylanase-encoding genes, xyn <dig> and xyn <dig>  the result was similar concerning the condition-specific response of the chromatin compaction. however, the difference in chromatin status provoked by the absence of xyr <dig> is less pronounced. a more detailed investigation of the dna accessibility in the cbh <dig> promoter showed that the deletion of xyr <dig> changed the in vivo footprinting pattern. in particular, we detected increased hypersensitivity on xyr1-sites and stronger protection of cre1-sites. looking for the players directly causing the observed chromatin remodelling, a whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing revealed that  <dig> genes encoding putative chromatin remodelers are differentially expressed in response to the applied condition and two amongst them are differentially expressed in the absence of xyr <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the regulation of xylanase and cellulase expression in t. reesei is not only restricted to the action of transcription factors but is clearly related to changes in the chromatin packaging. both the applied condition and the presence of xyr <dig> influence chromatin status.
