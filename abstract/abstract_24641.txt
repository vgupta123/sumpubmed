BACKGROUND
the histone-like protein hc <dig> binds dna in chlamydia trachomatis and is known to vary in size between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, which is caused by different numbers of lysine-rich pentamers. a more complex structure was seen in this study when sequences from  <dig> specimens covering the hctb gene, which encodes hc <dig>  were compared.


RESULTS
this study shows that the size variation is due to different numbers of 36-amino acid long repetitive elements built up of five pentamers and one hexamer. deletions and amino acid substitutions result in  <dig> variants of repetitive elements and these elements are combined into  <dig> configurations. a protein with similar structure has been described in bordetella but was now also found in other genera, including burkholderia, herminiimonas, minibacterium and ralstonia.

sequence determination resulted in  <dig> hctb variants that formed four clades in phylogenetic analysis. strains causing the eye disease trachoma and strains causing invasive lymphogranuloma venereum infections formed separate clades, while strains from urogenital infections were more heterogeneous. three cases of recombination were identified. the size variation of hc <dig> has previously been attributed to deletions of pentamers but we show that the structure is more complex with both duplication and deletions of 36-amino acid long elements.


CONCLUSIONS
the polymorphisms in hc <dig> need to be further investigated in experimental studies since dna binding is essential for the unique biphasic life cycle of the chlamydiacae. the high sequence variation in the corresponding hctb gene enables phylogenetic analysis and provides a suitable target for the genotyping of c. trachomatis.
