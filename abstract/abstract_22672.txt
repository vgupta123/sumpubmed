BACKGROUND
the capacity of respiring cultures of saccharomyces cerevisiae to immediately switch to fast alcoholic fermentation upon a transfer to anaerobic sugar-excess conditions is a key characteristic of saccharomyces cerevisiae in many of its industrial applications. this transition was studied by exposing aerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultures grown at a low specific growth rate to two simultaneous perturbations: oxygen depletion and relief of glucose limitation.


RESULTS
the shift towards fully fermentative conditions caused a massive transcriptional reprogramming, where one third of all genes within the genome were transcribed differentially. the changes in transcript levels were mostly driven by relief from glucose-limitation. after an initial strong response to the addition of glucose, the expression profile of most transcriptionally regulated genes displayed a clear switch at  <dig> minutes. in this respect, a striking difference was observed between the transcript profiles of genes encoding ribosomal proteins and those encoding ribosomal biogenesis components. not all regulated genes responded with this binary profile. a group of  <dig> genes showed a delayed and steady increase in expression that specifically responded to anaerobiosis.


CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrated that, despite the complexity of this multiple-input perturbation, the transcriptional responses could be categorized and biologically interpreted. by comparing this study with public datasets representing dynamic and steady conditions,  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes were determined to be anaerobic specific. therefore, these can be seen as true "signature" transcripts for anaerobicity under dynamic as well as under steady state conditions.
