BACKGROUND
in past number of methods have been developed for predicting subcellular location of eukaryotic, prokaryotic  and human proteins but no method has been developed for mycobacterial proteins which may represent repertoire of potent immunogens of this dreaded pathogen. in this study, attempt has been made to develop method for predicting subcellular location of mycobacterial proteins.


RESULTS
the models were trained and tested on  <dig> mycobacterial proteins and evaluated using five-fold cross-validation technique. first svm  model was developed using amino acid composition and overall accuracy of  <dig> % was achieved with average accuracy  of  <dig> %. in order to utilize evolutionary information, a svm model was developed using pssm  profiles obtained from psi-blast  and overall accuracy achieved was of  <dig> % with average accuracy of  <dig> %. in addition, hmm , meme/mast  and hybrid model that combined two or more models were also developed. we achieved maximum overall accuracy of  <dig> % with average accuracy of  <dig> % using combination of pssm based svm model and meme/mast. performance of our method was compared with that of the existing methods developed for predicting subcellular locations of gram-positive bacterial proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
a highly accurate method has been developed for predicting subcellular location of mycobacterial proteins. this method also predicts very important class of proteins that is membrane-attached proteins. this method will be useful in annotating newly sequenced or hypothetical mycobacterial proteins. based on above study, a freely accessible web server tbpred http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/tbpred/ has been developed.
