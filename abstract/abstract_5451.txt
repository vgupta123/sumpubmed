BACKGROUND
by definition, amyloplasts are plastids specialized for starch production. however, a proteomic study of amyloplasts isolated from wheat  endosperm at  <dig> days after anthesis  detected enzymes from many other metabolic and biosynthetic pathways. to better understand the role of amyloplasts in food production, the data from that study were evaluated in detail and an amyloplast metabolic map was outlined.


RESULTS
analysis of  <dig> proteins detected in an amyloplast preparation predicted that  <dig> were amyloplast proteins. criteria included homology with known plastid proteins, prediction of a plastid transit peptide for the wheat gene product or a close homolog, known plastid location of the pathway, and predicted plastid location for other members of the same pathway. of these,  <dig> enzymes were arranged into  <dig> pathways for carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid, nucleic acid and other biosynthetic processes that are critical for grain-fill. functions of the other proteins are also discussed.


CONCLUSIONS
the pathways outlined in this paper suggest that amyloplasts play a central role in endosperm metabolism. the interacting effects of genetics and environment on starch and protein production may be mediated in part by regulatory mechanisms within this organelle.
