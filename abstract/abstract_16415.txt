BACKGROUND
the bacillus subtilis-group and the bacillus cereus-group are two well-studied groups of species in the genus bacillus. bacteria in this genus can produce a highly resistant cell type, the spore, which is encased in a complex protective protein shell called the coat. spores in the b. cereus-group contain an additional outer layer, the exosporium, which encircles the coat. the coat in b. subtilis spores possesses inner and outer layers. the aim of this study is to investigate whether differences in the spore structures influenced the divergence of the coat protein genes during the evolution of these two bacillus species groups.


RESULTS
we designed and implemented a computational framework to compare the evolutionary histories of coat proteins. we curated a list of b. subtilis coat proteins and identified their orthologs in  <dig> bacillus species based on phylogenetic congruence. phylogenetic profiles of these coat proteins show that they can be divided into conserved and labile ones. coat proteins comprising the b. subtilis inner coat are significantly more conserved than those comprising the outer coat. we then performed genome-wide comparisons of the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio, dn/ds, and found contrasting patterns: coat proteins have significantly higher dn/ds in the b. subtilis-group genomes, but not in the b. cereus-group genomes. we further corroborated this contrast by examining changes of dn/ds within gene trees, and found that some coat protein gene trees have significantly different dn/ds between the b subtilis-clade and the b. cereus-clade.


CONCLUSIONS
coat proteins in the b. subtilis- and b. cereus-group species are under contrasting selective pressures. we speculate that the absence of the exosporium in the b. subtilis spore coat effectively lifted a structural constraint that has led to relaxed negative selection pressure on the outer coat.
