BACKGROUND
oat, avena sativa is the sixth most important cereal in the world. presently oat is mostly used as feed for animals. however, oat also has special properties that make it beneficial for human consumption and has seen a growing importance as a food crop in recent decades. increased demand for novel oat products has also put pressure on oat breeders to produce new oat varieties with specific properties such as increased or improved β-glucan-, antioxidant- and omega- <dig> fatty acid levels, as well as modified starch and protein content. to facilitate this development we have produced a tilling  population of the spring oat cultivar sw belinda.


RESULTS
here a population of  <dig> mutagenised m <dig> lines, producing  <dig> m <dig> seed lots were obtained. the m <dig> population was initially evaluated by visual inspection and a number of different phenotypes were seen ranging from dwarfs to giants, early flowering to late flowering, leaf morphology and chlorosis. phloroglucinol/hcl staining of m <dig> seeds, obtained from  <dig> different m <dig> lines, revealed a number of potential lignin mutants. these were later confirmed by quantitative analysis. genomic dna was prepared from the m <dig> population and the mutation frequency was determined. the estimated mutation frequency was one mutation per  <dig> kb by rapd-pcr fingerprinting, one mutation per  <dig> kb by maldi-tof analysis and one mutation per  <dig>  kb by dna sequencing. thus, the overall mutation frequency in the population is estimated to be one mutation per 20- <dig> kb, depending on if the method used addressed the whole genome or specific genes. during the investigation,  <dig> different mutations in the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  gene and  <dig> different mutations in the cellulose synthase-like  β-glucan biosynthesis gene were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
the oat tilling population produced in this work carries, on average, hundreds of mutations in every individual gene in the genome. it will therefore be an important resource in the development of oat with specific characters. the population  will be available for academic research via nordgen http://www.nordgen.org as soon as enough seeds are obtained.
