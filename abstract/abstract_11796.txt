BACKGROUND
the anticancer drug, 6-mercaptopurine  is subjected to metabolic clearance through xanthine oxidase  mediated hydroxylation, producing 6-thiouric acid , which is excreted in urine. this reduces the effective amount of drug available for therapeutic efficacy. co-administration of allopurinol, a suicide inhibitor of xod, which blocks the hydroxylation of 6mp inadvertently enhances the 6mp blood level, counters this reduction. however, allopurinol also blocks the hydroxylation of hypoxanthine, xanthine  leading to their accumulation in the body causing biochemical complications such as xanthine nephropathy. this necessitates the use of a preferential xod inhibitor that selectively inhibits 6mp transformation, but leaves xanthine metabolism unaffected.


RESULTS
here, we have characterized two such unique inhibitors namely, 2-amino-6-hydroxy-8-mercaptopurine  and 2-amino-6-purinethiol  on the basis of ic <dig> values, residual activity in bi-substrate simulative reaction and the kinetic parameters like km, ki, kcat. the ic <dig> values of ahmp for xanthine and 6mp as substrate are  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm, respectively and the ic <dig> values of apt for xanthine and 6mp as substrates are  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm, respectively. the ki values of xod using ahmp as inhibitor with xanthine and 6mp as substrate are  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm, respectively. the ki values of xod using apt as inhibitor with xanthine and 6mp as substrate are  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm. the corresponding km values of xod using xanthine and 6mp as substrate are  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm, respectively. the results suggest that the efficiency of substrate binding to xod and its subsequent catalytic hydroxylation is much superior for xanthine in comparison to 6mp. in addition, the efficiency of the inhibitor binding to xod is much more superior when 6mp is the substrate instead of xanthine. we further undertook the toxicological evaluation of these inhibitors in a single dose acute toxicity study in mice and our preliminary experimental results suggested that the inhibitors were equally non-toxic in the tested doses.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that administration of either apt or ahmp along with the major anti-leukemic drug 6mp might serve as a good combination cancer chemotherapy regimen.
