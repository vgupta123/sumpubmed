BACKGROUND
as a major epigenetic component, dna methylation plays important functions in individual development and various diseases. dna methylation has been well studied in human and model organisms, but only limited data exist in economically important animals like cattle.


RESULTS
using reduced representation bisulphite sequencing , we obtained single-base-resolution maps of bovine dna methylation from ten somatic tissues. in total, we evaluated  <dig> , <dig> cytosines in cg-enriched regions. while we found slightly low methylation levels  in cattle, the methylation contexts  of cattle showed similar methylation patterns to other species. non-cg methylation was detected but methylation levels in somatic tissues were significantly lower than in pluripotent cells. to study the potential function of the methylation, we detected  <dig>  differentially methylated cytosines  and  <dig> differentially methylated cg islands . further analyses in the same tissues revealed many dmcs  and dmis, which were highly correlated with the expression of genes involved in tissue development.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our study provides a baseline dataset and essential information for dna methylation profiles of cattle.
