BACKGROUND
application of single nucleotide polymorphism  marker technology as a tool in sunflower breeding programs offers enormous potential to improve sunflower genetics, and facilitate faster release of sunflower hybrids to the market place. through a national sunflower association  funded initiative, we report on the process of snp discovery through reductive genome sequencing and local assembly of six diverse sunflower inbred lines that represent oil as well as confection types.


RESULTS
a combination of restriction site associated dna sequencing  protocols and illumina paired-end sequencing chemistry generated high quality  <dig>  m paired end reads from the six lines which represent  <dig>  gb of the sequencing data. raw reads from the sunflower line, rha  <dig> were assembled de novo to serve as a framework reference genome. about  <dig>  mb of sunflower genome distributed over  <dig>  contigs were obtained upon assembly of rha  <dig> sequencing data, the contig lengths ranged from  <dig> to 950 bp with an n <dig> length of 393 bp. snp calling was performed by aligning sequencing data from the six sunflower lines to the assembled reference rha  <dig>  on average,  <dig> snp was located every 143 bp of the sunflower genome sequence. based on several filtering criteria, a final set of  <dig>  putative sequence variants with characteristics favorable for illumina infinium genotyping technology  were mined from the sequence data generated across six diverse sunflower lines.


CONCLUSIONS
here we report the molecular and computational methodology involved in snp development for a complex genome like sunflower lacking reference assembly, offering an attractive tool for molecular breeding purposes in sunflower.
