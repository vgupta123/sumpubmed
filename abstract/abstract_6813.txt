BACKGROUND
knowledge of protein domain boundaries is critical for the characterisation and understanding of protein function. the ability to identify domains without the knowledge of the structure – by using sequence information only – is an essential step in many types of protein analyses. in this present study, we demonstrate that the performance of domaindiscovery is improved significantly by including the inter-domain linker index value for domain identification from sequence-based information. improved domaindiscovery uses a support vector machine  approach and a unique training dataset built on the principle of consensus among experts in defining domains in protein structure. the svm was trained using a pssm , secondary structure, solvent accessibility information and inter-domain linker index to detect possible domain boundaries for a target sequence.


RESULTS
improved domaindiscovery is compared with other methods by benchmarking against a structurally non-redundant dataset and also casp <dig> targets. improved domaindiscovery achieves 70% accuracy for domain boundary identification in multi-domains proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
improved domaindiscovery compares favourably to the performance of other methods and excels in the identification of domain boundaries for multi-domain proteins as a result of introducing support vector machine with benchmark_ <dig> dataset.
