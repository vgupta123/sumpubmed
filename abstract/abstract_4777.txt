BACKGROUND
during a substantial elevation in scarlet fever  notifications in  <dig> a national genomic study was undertaken of streptococcus pyogenes  isolates from patients with sf with comparison to isolates from patients with invasive disease  to test the hypotheses that the increase in sf was due to either the introduction of one or more new/emerging strains in the population in england or the transmission of a known genetic element through the population of gas by horizontal gene transfer  resulting in infections with an increased likelihood of causing sf. isolates were collected to provide geographical representation, for approximately 5% sf isolates from each region from 1st april  <dig> to 18th june  <dig>  contemporaneous igas isolates for which genomic data were available were included for comparison. data were analysed in order to determine emm gene sequence type, phylogenetic lineage and genomic clade representation, the presence of known prophage elements and the presence of genes known to confer pathogenicity and resistance to antibiotics.


RESULTS
 <dig> isolates were analysed,  <dig> from patients with sf and  <dig> from patients with igas. isolates from patients with sf were of multiple distinct emm sequence types and phylogenetic lineages. prior to data normalisation, emm <dig> was the predominant type . post-normalisation emm types,  <dig> and  <dig>  were found to be over-represented in patients with sf versus igas . a single gene, ssa, was over-represented in isolates from patients with sf. no single phage was found to be over represented in sf vs igas. however, a “meta-ssa” phage defined by the presence of : <dig> , spsp <dig>  mgas <dig>  or hk360ssa, was found to be over represented. the hku <dig> vir phage was not detected yet the hku <dig> ssa phage was present in 43/ <dig> emm <dig> isolates but not found to be over-represented in isolates from patients with sf.


CONCLUSIONS
there is no evidence that the increased number of sf cases was a strain-specific or known mobile element specific phenomenon, as the increase in sf cases was associated with multiple lineages of gas.
