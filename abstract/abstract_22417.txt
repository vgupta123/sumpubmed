BACKGROUND
cecropin a is a natural antimicrobial peptide that exhibits rapid, potent and long-lasting lytic activity against a broad spectrum of pathogens, thus having great biotechnological potential. here, we report a system for producing bioactive cecropin a in rice seeds.


RESULTS
transgenic rice plants expressing a codon-optimized synthetic cecropin a gene drived by an endosperm-specific promoter, either the glutelin b <dig> or glutelin b <dig> promoter, were generated. the signal peptide sequence from either the glutelin b <dig> or the glutelin b <dig> were n-terminally fused to the coding sequence of the cecropin a. we also studied whether the presence of the kdel endoplasmic reticulum retention signal at the c-terminal has an effect on cecropin a subcellular localization and accumulation. the transgenic rice plants showed stable transgene integration and inheritance. we show that cecropin a accumulates in protein storage bodies in the rice endosperm, particularly in type ii protein bodies, supporting that the glutelin n-terminal signal peptides play a crucial role in directing the cecropin a to this organelle, independently of being tagged with the kdel endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. the production of cecropin a in transgenic rice seeds did not affect seed viability or seedling growth. furthermore, transgenic cecropin a seeds exhibited resistance to infection by fungal and bacterial pathogens  indicating that the in planta-produced cecropin a is biologically active.


CONCLUSIONS
rice seeds can sustain bioactive cecropin a production and accumulation in protein bodies. the system might benefit the production of this antimicrobial agent for subsequent applications in crop protection and food preservation.
