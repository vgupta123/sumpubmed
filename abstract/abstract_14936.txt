BACKGROUND
plant resistance genes  exist in large families and usually contain both a nucleotide-binding site domain and a leucine-rich repeat domain, denoted nbs-lrr. the genome sequence of cassava  is a valuable resource for analysing the genomic organization of resistance genes in this crop.


RESULTS
with searches for pfam domains and manual curation of the cassava gene annotations, we identified  <dig> nbs-lrr type genes and  <dig> partial nbs genes. these represent almost 1% of the total predicted genes and show high sequence similarity to proteins from other plant species. furthermore,  <dig> contained an n-terminal toll/interleukin -like domain, and  <dig> contained an n-terminal coiled-coil  domain. 63% of the  <dig> r genes occurred in  <dig> clusters on the chromosomes. these clusters are mostly homogeneous, containing nbs-lrrs derived from a recent common ancestor.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides insight into the evolution of nbs-lrr genes in the cassava genome; the phylogenetic and mapping information may aid efforts to further characterize the function of these predicted r genes.
