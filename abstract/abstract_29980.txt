BACKGROUND
-3-amino-4--benzonitrile  is currently the mostly used radiotracer for positron emission tomography  quantitative studies of the serotonin transporter  in the human brain but has never been validated in dogs. the first objective was therefore to evaluate normal dasb distribution in different brain regions of healthy dogs using pet. the second objective was to provide less invasive and more convenient alternative methods to the arterial sampling-based kinetic analysis.


RESULTS
a dynamic acquisition of the brain was performed during 90 min. the pet images were coregistered with the magnetic resonance images taken prior to the study in order to manually drawn  <dig> regions of interest . the highest radioactivity concentration of dasb was observed in the hypothalamus, raphe nuclei and thalamus and lowest levels in the parietal cortex, occipital cortex and cerebellum.

the regional radioactivity in those  <dig> rois was quantified using the multilinear reference tissue model  <dig>  and a semi-quantitative method. the values showed least variability between  <dig> and 60 min and this time interval was set as the optimal time interval for dasb quantification in the canine brain. the correlation  between the mrtm <dig> and the semi-quantitative method using the data between  <dig> and 60 min was  <dig>  % .


CONCLUSIONS
the reference tissue models and semi-quantitative method provide a more convenient alternative to invasive arterial sampling models in the evaluation of the sert of the normal canine brain. the optimal time interval for static scanning is set at  <dig> to 60 min after tracer injection.
