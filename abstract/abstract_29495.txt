BACKGROUND
prolactin receptor  and growth hormone receptor  belong to the large superfamily of class  <dig> cytokine receptors. both of them have been identified as candidate genes affecting key quantitative traits, like growth and reproduction in livestock. we have previously studied the molecular anatomy of the cytoplasmic domain of ghr in different cattle breeds and artiodactyl species. in this study we have analysed the corresponding cytoplasmic signalling region of prlr.


RESULTS
we sequenced prlr gene exon  <dig>  coding for the major part of the cytoplasmic domain, from cattle, american bison, european bison, yak, sheep, pig and wild boar individuals. we found different patterns of variation in the two receptors within and between ruminants and pigs. pigs and bison species have no variation within ghr exon  <dig>  but show high haplotype diversity for the prlr exon  <dig>  in cattle, prlr shows lower diversity than ghr. the bovinae prlr haplotype network fits better the known phylogenetic relationships between the species than that of the ghr, where differences within cattle breeds are larger than between the different species in the subfamily. by comparison with the wild boar haplotypes, a high number of subsequent nonsynonymous substitutions seem to have accumulated in the pig prlr exon  <dig> after domestication.


CONCLUSIONS
both genes affect a multitude of traits that have been targets of selection after domestication. the genes seem to have responded differently to different selection pressures imposed by human artificial selection. the results suggest possible effects of selective sweeps in ghr before domestication in the pig lineage or species divergence in the bison lineage. the prlr results may be explained by strong directional selection in pigs or functional switching.
