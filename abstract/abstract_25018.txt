BACKGROUND
several approaches can be used to functionalize biomaterials, such as hydrogels, for biomedical applications. one of the molecules often used to improve cells adhesion is the peptide arg-gly-asp . the rgd sequence, present in several proteins from the extra-cellular matrix , is a ligand for integrin-mediated cell adhesion; this sequence was recognized as a major functional group responsible for cellular adhesion. in this work a bi-functional recombinant protein, containing a starch binding module  and rgd sequence was used to functionalize a dextrin-based hydrogel. the sbm, which belongs to an Î±-amylase from bacillus sp. ts- <dig>  has starch  affinity, acting as a binding molecule to adsorb the rgd sequence to the hydrogel surface.


RESULTS
the recombinant proteins sbm and rgd-sbm were cloned, expressed, purified and tested in in vitro assays. the evaluation of cell attachment, spreading and proliferation on the dextrin-based hydrogel surface activated with recombinant proteins were performed using mouse embryo fibroblasts 3t <dig>  a polystyrene cell culture plate was used as control. the results showed that the rgd-sbm recombinant protein improved, by more than 30%, the adhesion of fibroblasts to dextrin-based hydrogel. in fact, cell spreading on the hydrogel surface was observed only in the presence of the rgd-sbm.


CONCLUSIONS
the fusion protein rgd-sbm provides an efficient way to functionalize the dextrin-based hydrogel. many proteins in nature that hold a rgd sequence are not cell adhesive, probably due to the conformation/accessibility of the peptide. we therefore emphasise the successful expression of a bi-functional protein with potential for different applications.
