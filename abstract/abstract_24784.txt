BACKGROUND
rna sequencing takes advantage of the next generation sequencing  technologies for analyzing rna transcript counts with an excellent accuracy. trying to interpret this huge amount of data in biological information is still a key issue, reason for which the creation of web-resources useful for their analysis is highly desiderable.


RESULTS
starting from a previous work, transcriptator, we present the atlas of hydra’s vulgaris, an extensible web tool in which its complete transcriptome is annotated. in order to provide to the users an advantageous resource that include the whole functional annotated transcriptome of hydra vulgaris water polyp, we implemented the atlas web-tool contains  <dig>  accesible and downloadable transcripts of this non-reference model organism.


CONCLUSIONS
atlas, as a freely available resource, can be considered a valuable tool to rapidly retrieve functional annotation for transcripts differentially expressed in hydra vulgaris exposed to the distinct experimental treatments.
