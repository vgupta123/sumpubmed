BACKGROUND
phage-display panning is an integral part of biomedical research. regular panning methods are sometimes complicated by inefficient detachment of the captured phages from the antigen-coated solid supports, which prompted us to modify. here, we produce an efficient antigen-specific single chain fragment variable  antibody by using a target-related molecule that favored selection ofrecombinant antibodies.


RESULTS
to produce more selective and specific anti-idiotypic scfv-antibodies from a cdna library, constructed from hm- <dig> killer toxin -neutralizing monoclonal antibodies , the method was modified by using an elution buffer supplemented with hm- <dig> that shares structural and functional similarities with the active site of the scfv antibody. competitive binding of hm- <dig> to nmab-kt allowed easy and quick dissociation of scfv-displayed phages from immobilized nmab-kt to select specific anti-idiotypic scfv antibodies of hm- <dig>  after modified panning, 80% clones  showed several times higher binding affinity to nmab-kt than regular panning. the major populations  of these clones  were genotypically same and had strong cytocidal activity against saccharomyces and candida species. the scfv k <dig>  had strong reactivity toward nmab-kt, like hm- <dig>  as judged by spr analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
the scfv antibodies generated after modified subtractive panning appear to have superior binding properties and cytocidal activity than regular panning. a simple modification of the elution condition in the phage-display panning protocol makes a large difference in determining success. our method offers an attractive platform to discover potential therapeutic candidates.
