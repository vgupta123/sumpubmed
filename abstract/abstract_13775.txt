BACKGROUND
in vertebrate organisms, the neural crest  gives rise to multipotential and highly migratory progenitors which are distributed throughout the embryo and generate, among other structures, the peripheral nervous system, including the intrinsic neuroglial networks of the gut, i.e. the enteric nervous system . the majority of enteric neurons and glia originate from vagal nc-derived progenitors which invade the foregut mesenchyme and migrate rostro-caudally to colonise the entire length of the gut. although the migratory behaviour of nc cells has been studied extensively, it remains unclear how their properties and response to microenvironment change as they navigate through complex cellular terrains to reach their target embryonic sites.


RESULTS
using conditional gene inactivation in mice we demonstrate here that the cell cycle-dependent protein geminin  is critical for the survival of ens progenitors in a stage-dependent manner. gem deletion in early ens progenitors  resulted in cell-autonomous activation of dna damage response and p53-dependent apoptosis, leading to severe intestinal aganglionosis. in contrast, ablation of gem shortly after ens progenitors had invaded the embryonic gut did not result in discernible survival or migratory deficits. in contrast to other developmental systems, we obtained no evidence for a role of gem in commitment or differentiation of ens lineages. the stage-dependent resistance of ens progenitors to mutation-induced genotoxic stress was further supported by the enhanced survival of post gut invasion ens lineages to γ-irradiation relative to their predecessors.


CONCLUSIONS
our experiments demonstrate that, in mammals, nc-derived ens lineages are sensitive to genotoxic stress in a stage-specific manner. following gut invasion, ens progenitors are distinctly resistant to gem ablation and irradiation in comparison to their pre-enteric counterparts. these studies suggest that the microenvironment of the embryonic gut protects ens progenitors and their progeny from genotoxic stress.
