BACKGROUND
although melon  is an economically important fruit crop, no genome-wide sequence information is openly available at the current time. we therefore sequenced bac-ends representing a total of  <dig>  clones, half of them from a previously described melon bac library generated with restriction endonucleases and the remainder from a new random-shear bac library.


RESULTS
we generated a total of  <dig>  high-quality bac-end sequences ,  <dig> % of which were paired-bes. both libraries were assembled independently and then cross-assembled to obtain a final set of  <dig>  non-redundant, high-quality sequences. these were grouped into  <dig>  contigs  and  <dig>  non-assembled bes , representing ~ <dig> % of the melon genome. the sequences were used to screen genomic databases, identifying  <dig>  simple sequence repeats  and  <dig>  additional repeats of which  <dig> % represented transposable elements. the sequences were also used to screen expressed sequence tag  databases, revealing  <dig>  bes that were homologous to ests. this suggests that ~30% of the melon genome consists of coding dna. we observed regions of microsynteny between melon paired-bes and six other dicotyledonous plant genomes.


CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of nearly  <dig>  bes from two complementary genomic libraries covered ~ <dig> % of the melon genome, providing insight into properties such as microsatellite and transposable element distribution, and the percentage of coding dna. the observed synteny between melon paired-bes and six other plant genomes showed that useful comparative genomic data can be derived through large scale bac-end sequencing by anchoring a small proportion of the melon genome to other sequenced genomes.
