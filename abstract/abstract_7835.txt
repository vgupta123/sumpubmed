BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small, non-coding rnas playing essential roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses. sequencing of small rnas is a starting point for understanding their number, diversity, expression and possible roles in plants.


RESULTS
in this study, we conducted a genome-wide survey of wheat mirnas from  <dig> tissues, characterizing a total of  <dig> novel mirnas belonging to  <dig> families in wheat. a mirna conservation analysis identified  <dig> wheat-specific mirnas,  <dig> monocot-specific mirnas, and  <dig> wheat-specific variants from  <dig> highly conserved mirna families. to understand possible roles of wheat mirnas, we determined  <dig> potential targets for  <dig> mirna families through degradome sequencing, and cleavage of a subset of them was validated via 5â€² race. based on the genome-wide identification and characterization of mirnas and their associated target genes, we further identified  <dig> mirnas preferentially expressing in developing or germinating grains, which could play important roles in grain development.


CONCLUSIONS
we discovered  <dig> wheat novel mirnas and  <dig> target genes for  <dig> mirna families in a genome-wide level, and our data will serve as a foundation for future research into the functional roles of mirnas in wheat.
