BACKGROUND
electrophysiological data suggest that cardiac katp channels consist of kir <dig>  and sur2a subunits, but the distribution of these  is poorly defined. we examined the localization of each of the katp channel subunits in the mouse and rat heart.


RESULTS
immunohistochemistry of cardiac cryosections demonstrate kir <dig>  protein to be expressed in ventricular myocytes, as well as in the smooth muscle and endothelial cells of coronary resistance vessels. endothelial capillaries also stained positive for kir <dig>  protein. kir <dig>  protein expression was found predominantly in ventricular myocytes and also in endothelial cells, but not in smooth muscle cells. sur <dig> subunits are strongly expressed at the sarcolemmal surface of ventricular myocytes , whereas sur <dig> protein was found to be localized predominantly in cardiac myocytes and coronary vessels . immunocytochemistry of isolated ventricular myocytes shows co-localization of kir <dig>  and sur <dig> proteins in a striated sarcomeric pattern, suggesting t-tubular expression of these proteins. both kir <dig>  and sur <dig> subunits were found to express strongly at the sarcolemma. the role of these subunits in cardiomyocytes remain to be defined and may require a reassessment of the molecular nature of ventricular katp channels.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our data demonstrate unique cellular and subcellular katp channel subunit expression patterns in the heart. these results suggest distinct roles for katp channel subunits in diverse cardiac structures.
