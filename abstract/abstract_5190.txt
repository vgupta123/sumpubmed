BACKGROUND
although bacteria are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases , mechanisms of intestinal injury and immune activation remain unclear. identification of adherent-invasive escherichia coli  strains in ibd patients offers an opportunity to characterize the pathogenesis of microbial-induced intestinal inflammation in ibd. previous studies have focused on the invasive phenotype of aiec and the ability to replicate and survive in phagocytes. however, the precise mechanisms by which these newly identified microbes penetrate the epithelial lining remain to be clarified. therefore, the aim of this study was to delineate the effects of aiec, strain lf <dig>  on model polarized epithelial monolayers as a contributor to intestinal injury in ibd.


RESULTS
infection of t <dig> and madin-darby canine kidney-i polarized epithelial cell monolayers with aiec, strain lf <dig> led to a reduction in transepithelial electrical resistance and increased macromolecular  flux. basolateral aiec infection resulted in more severe disruption of the epithelial barrier. increased permeability was accompanied by a redistribution of the tight junction adaptor protein, zonula occludens- <dig>  demonstrated by confocal microscopy and formation of gaps between cells, as shown by transmission electron microscopy. after  <dig> h of infection of intestine  <dig> cells, bacteria replicated in the cell cytoplasm and were enclosed in membrane-bound vesicles positive for the late endosomal marker, lamp <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these findings indicate that aiec, strain lf <dig> disrupts the integrity of the polarized epithelial cell barrier. this disruption enables bacteria to penetrate into the epithelium and replicate in the host cell cytoplasm. these findings provide important links between microbes related to ibd, the intestinal epithelial cell barrier and disease pathogenesis.
