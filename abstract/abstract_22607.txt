BACKGROUND
lippia sidoides cham., also known as pepper-rosmarin, produces an essential oil in its leaves that is currently used by the pharmaceutical, perfumery and cosmetic industries for its antimicrobial and aromatic properties. because of the antimicrobial compounds  found in the essential oil, we believe that the endophytic microorganisms found in l. sidoides are selected to live in different parts of the plant.


RESULTS
in this study, the endophytic microbial communities from the stems and leaves of four l. sidoides genotypes were determined using cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent approaches. in total,  <dig> endophytic bacterial strains were isolated and further grouped using either eric-pcr or box-pcr, resulting in  <dig> groups composed of different genera predominantly belonging to the gammaproteobacteria. the endophytic microbial diversity was also analyzed by pcr-dgge using 16s rrna-based universal and group-specific primers for total bacteria, alphaproteobacteria, betaproteobacteria and actinobacteria and 18s rrna-based primers for fungi. pcr-dgge profile analysis and principal component analysis showed that the total bacteria, alphaproteobacteria, betaproteobacteria and fungi were influenced not only by the location within the plant  but also by the presence of the main components of the l. sidoides essential oil  in the leaves. however, the same could not be observed within the actinobacteria.


CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here are the first step to begin shedding light on the impact of the essential oil in the endophytic microorganisms in pepper-rosmarin.
