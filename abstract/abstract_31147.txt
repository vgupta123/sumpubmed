BACKGROUND
in europe the mountain hare  exists in great britain, norway, sweden, finland, parts of the alps and in eastern europe, but not in denmark. interspecific hybridization has been demonstrated between native swedish mountain hares and introduced brown hares . during the data collection in a study concerning danish brown hares we identified  <dig> hares with a single very divergent haplotype.


RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis shows that the divergent danish haplotype is most closely related to the swedish mountain hare. the frequency of lepus timidus mtdna haplotype in the eastern danish hare populations is estimated to 6%.


CONCLUSIONS
in contrast to what is known, the danish hare populations are not pure l. europaeus populations but include introgressed brown hares with swedish l. timidus mtdna. the most probable explanation of this is natural migration or translocation of introgressed brown hares from sweden. the impurity of hare populations has implications for conservation and population genetics.
