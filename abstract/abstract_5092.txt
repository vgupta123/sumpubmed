BACKGROUND
the number of protein targets with a known or predicted tri-dimensional structure and of drug-like chemical compounds is growing rapidly and so is the need for new therapeutic compounds or chemical probes. performing flexible structure-based virtual screening computations on thousands of targets with millions of molecules is intractable to most laboratories nor indeed desirable. since shape complementarity is of primary importance for most protein-ligand interactions, we have developed a tool/protocol based on rigid-body docking to select compounds that fit well into binding sites.


RESULTS
here we present an efficient multiple conformation rigid-body docking approach, ms-dock, which is based on the program dock. this approach can be used as the first step of a multi-stage docking/scoring protocol. first, we developed and validated the multiconf-dock tool that generates several conformers per input ligand. then, each generated conformer  was docked rigidly using dock <dig> with our optimized protocol into seven different receptor-binding sites. ms-dock was able to significantly reduce the size of the initial input library for all seven targets, thereby facilitating subsequent more cpu demanding flexible docking procedures.


CONCLUSIONS
ms-dock can be easily used for the generation of multi-conformer libraries and for shape-based filtering within a multi-step structure-based screening protocol in order to shorten computation times.
