BACKGROUND
comparative analyses of chromosomal gene orders are successfully used to predict
gene clusters in bacterial and fungal genomes. present models for detecting sets
of co-localized genes in chromosomal sequences require prior knowledge of gene
family assignments of genes in the dataset of interest. these families are often
computationally predicted on the basis of sequence similarity or higher order
features of gene products. errors introduced in this process amplify in subsequent
gene order analyses and thus may deteriorate gene cluster prediction.


RESULTS
in this work, we present a new dynamic model and efficient computational
approaches for gene cluster prediction suitable in scenarios ranging from
traditional gene family-based gene cluster prediction, via multiple conflicting
gene family annotations, to gene family-free analysis, in which gene clusters are
predicted solely on the basis of a pairwise similarity measure of the genes of
different genomes. we evaluate our gene family-free model against a gene
family-based model on a dataset of  <dig> bacterial genomes.


CONCLUSIONS
our model is able to detect gene clusters that would be also detected with
well-established gene family-based approaches. moreover, we show that it is able
to detect conserved regions which are missed by gene family-based methods due to
wrong or deficient gene family assignments.
