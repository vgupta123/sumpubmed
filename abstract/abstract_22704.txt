BACKGROUND
we introduce approximate entropy as a mathematical method of analysis for microarray data. approximate entropy is applied here as a method to classify the complex gene expression patterns resultant of a clinical sample set. since entropy is a measure of disorder in a system, we believe that by choosing genes which display minimum entropy in normal controls and maximum entropy in the cancerous sample set we will be able to distinguish those genes which display the greatest variability in the cancerous set. here we describe a method of utilizing approximate sample entropy  analysis to identify genes of interest with the highest probability of producing an accurate, predictive, classification model from our data set.


RESULTS
in the development of a diagnostic gene-expression profile for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia  and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, we identified  <dig> genes which are unchanging in all normal tissue samples, yet exhibit a random pattern indicative of the genetic instability and heterogeneity of malignant cells. this may be measured in terms of the apse when compared to normal tissue. we have validated  <dig> of these genes on  <dig> normal and  <dig> cancer and cin <dig> samples. we report that the predictive value of the sample entropy calculation for these  <dig> genes of interest is promising .


CONCLUSIONS
the success of the approximate sample entropy approach in discerning alterations in complexity from biological system with such relatively small sample set, and extracting biologically relevant genes of interest hold great promise.
