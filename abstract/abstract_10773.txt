BACKGROUND
by examining the genotype calls generated by the  <dig> genomes project we discovered that the human reference genome grch <dig> contains almost  <dig>  loci in which the reference allele has never been observed in healthy individuals and around  <dig>  loci in which it has been observed only in the heterozygous state.


RESULTS
we show that a large fraction of this rare reference allele  loci belongs to coding, functional and regulatory elements of the genome and could be linked to rare mendelian disorders as well as cancer. we also demonstrate that classical germline and somatic variant calling tools are not capable to recognize the rare allele when present in these loci. to overcome such limitations, we developed a novel tool, named rarevator, that is able to identify and call the rare allele in these genomic positions. by using a small cancer dataset we compared our tool with two state-of-the-art callers and we found that rarevator identified more than  <dig>  germline and  <dig> somatic rra variants missed by the two methods and which belong to significantly mutated pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
these results show that, to date, the investigation of around  <dig>  loci of the human genome has been missed by re-sequencing experiments based on the grch <dig> assembly and that our tool can fill the gap left by other methods. moreover, the investigation of the latest version of the human reference genome, grch <dig>  showed that although the grc corrected almost all insertions and a small part of snvs and deletions, a large number of functionally relevant rras still remain unchanged. for this reason, also future resequencing experiments, based on grch <dig>  will benefit from rarevator analysis results. rarevator is freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/rarevator.
