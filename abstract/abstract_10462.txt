BACKGROUND
the impact of food animals as a possible reservoir for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  producing enterobacteriaceae, and the dissemination of such strains into the food production chain need to be assessed. in this study  <dig> fecal samples from pigs, cattle, chicken and sheep were investigated at slaughter. additionally,  <dig> raw milk samples, representing bulk tank milk of  <dig> different dairy farms,  <dig> minced meat  samples and  <dig> e. coli isolates from cattle e. coli mastitis were analyzed.


RESULTS
as many as  <dig> % of the porcine,  <dig> % of the bovine,  <dig> % of the sheep and  <dig> % of the chicken fecal samples yielded esbl producers after an enrichment step. in contrast, none of the minced meat, none of the bulk tank milk samples and only one of the mastitis milk samples contained esbl producing strains. of the total of  <dig> isolates,  <dig> were e. coli, one was citrobacter youngae and one was enterobacter cloacae. pcr analysis revealed that  <dig> isolates  produced ctx-m group  <dig> esbls while six isolates  produced ctx-m group  <dig> enzymes. five detected esbls  belonged to the shv group and  <dig> isolates  contained a tem-type enzyme. a total of  <dig> ctx-m producers were additionally pcr-positive for tem-beta-lactamase. the esbl-encoding genes of  <dig> isolates were sequenced of which  <dig> produced ctx-m- <dig>   <dig> produced ctx-m- <dig>   <dig> produced ctx-m- <dig> and also  <dig> produced shv- <dig>  two isolates produced tem- <dig> and one isolate expressed a novel ctx-m group  <dig> esbl, ctx-m- <dig>  one isolate--aside from a ctx-m esbl-- contained an additional novel tem-type broad-spectrum beta-lactamase, tem- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the relatively high rates of esbl producers in food animals and the high genetic diversity among these isolates are worrisome and indicate an established reservoir in farm animals.
