BACKGROUND
in preparation for migration from freshwater to marine habitats, atlantic salmon  undergo smoltification, a transformation that includes the acquisition of hyposmoregulatory capacity. the growth hormone /insulin-like growth-factor  axis promotes the development of branchial ionoregulatory functions that underlie ion secretion. igfs interact with a suite of igf binding proteins  that modulate hormone activity. in atlantic salmon smolts, igfbp <dig> −5a,−5b <dig> −5b <dig> −6b <dig> and−6b <dig> transcripts are highly expressed in gill. we measured mrna levels of branchial and hepatic igfbps during smoltification , desmoltification  and following seawater  exposure in march and may. we also characterized parallel changes in a broad suite of osmoregulatory  activity, na

RESULTS
indicative of smoltification, we observed increased branchial nka activity, nkcc <dig> and cftr <dig> transcription in may. branchial igfbp6b <dig> and -6b <dig> expression increased coincidentally with smoltification. following a sw challenge in march, igfbp6b <dig> showed increased expression while igfbp6b <dig> exhibited diminished expression. igfbp5a,−5b <dig> and−5b <dig> mrna levels did not change during smolting, but each had lower levels following a sw exposure in march.


CONCLUSIONS
salmonids express an especially large suite of igfbps. our data suggest that dynamic expression of particular igfbps accompanies smoltification and sw challenges; thus, transcriptional control of igfbps may provide a mechanism for the local modulation of igf activity in salmon gill.
