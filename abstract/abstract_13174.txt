BACKGROUND
attaching and effacing escherichia coli  are characterized by their ability to cause attaching-and-effacing  lesions in the gut mucosa of human and animal hosts leading to diarrhoea. the genetic determinants for the production of a/e lesions are located on the locus of enterocyte effacement , a pathogenicity island that also contains the genes encoding intimin . this study reports data on the occurrence of eae positive e. coli carried by healthy pigs and sheep at the point of slaughter, and on serotypes, intimin variants, and further virulence factors of isolated aeec strains.


RESULTS
faecal samples from  <dig> finished pigs and  <dig> sheep were examined at slaughter. the proportion of eae positive samples was 89% for pigs and 55% for sheep. by colony dot-blot hybridization, aeec were isolated from  <dig> and  <dig> randomly selected porcine and ovine samples and further characterized. strains of the serotypes o2:h <dig>  o3:h <dig> and o26:h <dig> were found in both pigs and sheep. in pigs o2:h <dig>  o2:h <dig>  o108:h <dig>  o145:h <dig> and in sheep o2:h <dig>  o26:h <dig>  o70:h <dig>  o146:h <dig> were the most prevalent serotypes among typable strains. eleven different intimin types were detected, whereas γ2/θ was the most frequent, followed by β <dig>  ε and γ <dig>  all but two ovine strains tested negative for the genes encoding shiga toxins. all strains tested negative for the bfpa gene and the eaf plasmid. east <dig>  was present in  <dig> of the isolated strains.


CONCLUSIONS
our data show that pigs and sheep are a source of serologically and genetically diverse intimin-harbouring e. coli strains. most of the strains show characteristics of atypical enteropathogenic e. coli. nevertheless, there are stx-negative aeec strains belonging to serotypes and intimin types that are associated with classical enterohaemorrhagic e. coli strains .
