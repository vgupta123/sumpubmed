BACKGROUND
genomic and transcriptomic approaches have the potential for unveiling the genome-wide response to environmental perturbations. the abundance of the catadromous european eel  stock has been declining since the 1980s probably due to a combination of anthropogenic and climatic factors. in this paper, we explore the transcriptomic dynamics between individuals from high  and low pollution  environments, which were measured for  <dig> pcbs, several organochlorine pesticides and brominated flame retardants and nine metals.


RESULTS
to this end, we first  updated the european eel transcriptome using deep sequencing data with a total of  <dig>  reads assembled into  <dig>  contigs , and  developed a transcriptomic platform for global gene expression profiling in the critically endangered european eel of about  <dig>  annotated contigs, which was applied to detect differentially expressed genes between polluted sites. several detoxification genes related to metabolism of pollutants were upregulated in the highly polluted site, including genes that take part in phase i of the xenobiotic metabolism , phase ii  and oxidative stress . in addition, key genes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation were down-regulated at the tiber site relative to the bolsena site.


CONCLUSIONS
together with the induced high expression of detoxification genes, the suggested lowered expression of genes supposedly involved in metabolism suggests that pollution may also be associated with decreased respiratory and energy production.
