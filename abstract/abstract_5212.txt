BACKGROUND
modelling proteins with multiple domains is one of the central challenges in structural biology. although homology modelling has successfully been applied for prediction of protein structures, very often domain-domain interactions cannot be inferred from the structures of homologues and their prediction requires ab initio methods. here we present a new structural prediction approach for modelling two-domain proteins based on rigid-body domain-domain docking.


RESULTS
here we focus on interacting domain pairs that are part of the same peptide chain and thus have an inter-domain peptide region . we have developed a method called pydocktet , which uses rigid-body docking to generate domain-domain poses that are further scored by binding energy and a pseudo-energy term based on restraints derived from linker end-to-end distances. the method has been benchmarked on a set of  <dig> non-redundant pairs of domains with available x-ray structure. we have evaluated the docking method zdock, which is able to generate acceptable domain-domain orientations in  <dig> out of the  <dig> cases. among them, our method pydocktet finds the correct assembly within the top  <dig> solutions in over 60% of the cases. as a further test, on a subset of  <dig> pairs where domains were built by homology modelling, zdock generates acceptable orientations in  <dig> out of the  <dig> cases, among which the correct assembly is ranked lower than  <dig> in around 70% of the cases by our pydocktet method.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that rigid-body docking approach plus energy scoring and linker-based restraints are useful for modelling domain-domain interactions. these positive results will encourage development of new methods for structural prediction of macromolecules with multiple  domains.
