BACKGROUND
sin <dig> is a transcriptional repressor protein known to regulate many genes, including a number of those that encode mitochondrial components.


RESULTS
by monitoring rna levels, we find that loss of sin <dig> in drosophila cultured cells results in up-regulation of not only nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes, but also those encoded by the mitochondrial genome. the up-regulation of gene expression is accompanied by a perturbation in atp levels in sin3-deficient cells, suggesting that the changes in mitochondrial gene expression result in altered mitochondrial activity. in support of the hypothesis that sin <dig> is necessary for normal mitochondrial function, yeast sin <dig> null mutants exhibit very poor growth on non-fermentable carbon sources and show lower levels of atp and reduced respiration rates.


CONCLUSIONS
the findings that both yeast and drosophila sin <dig> affect mitochondrial activity suggest an evolutionarily conserved role for sin <dig> in the control of cellular energy production.
