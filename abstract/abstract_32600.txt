BACKGROUND
effectiveness of genomic selection and fine mapping is determined by the level of linkage disequilibrium  across the genome. knowledge of the range of genome-wide ld, defined as a non-random association of alleles at different loci, can provide an insight into the optimal density and location of single-nucleotide polymorphisms  for genome-wide association studies and can be a keystone for interpretation of results from qtl mapping.


RESULTS
linkage disequilibrium was measured by |d'| and r <dig> between  <dig>  snps  using genotypes of  <dig> holstein bulls. the average level of |d'| and r <dig> for markers 40- <dig> kb apart was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively in holstein cattle. however, a high degree of heterogeneity of ld was observed across the genome. the sample size and minor allele frequency had an effect on |d'| estimates, however, r <dig> was not noticeably affected by these two factors. syntenic ld was shown to be useful for verifying the physical location of snps. no differences in the extent of ld and decline of ld with distance were found between the intragenic and intergenic regions.


CONCLUSIONS
a minimal sample size of  <dig> and  <dig> animals is required for an accurate estimation of ld by |d'| and r <dig>  respectively. the use of only maternally inherited haplotypes is recommended for analyses of ld in populations consisting of large paternal half-sib families. large heterogeneity in the pattern and the extent of ld in holstein cattle was observed on both autosomes and the x chromosome. the extent of ld was higher on the x chromosome compared to the autosomes.
