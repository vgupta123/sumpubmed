BACKGROUND
since the completion of the rat reference genome in  <dig>  whole-genome sequencing data from more than  <dig> rat strains have become available. these data represent the broad range of strains that are used in rat research including commonly used substrains. currently, this wealth of information cannot be used to its full extent, because the variety of different variant calling algorithms employed by different groups impairs comparison between strains. in addition, all rat whole genome sequencing studies to date used an outdated reference genome for analysis .


RESULTS
here we present a comprehensive, multi-sample and uniformly called set of genetic variants in  <dig> rat strains, including  <dig> substrains. we reanalyzed all primary data using a recent version of the rat reference assembly  and identified over  <dig> million genomic variants  among the  <dig> strains.  <dig>  snvs are specific to individual substrains, which may be explained by introgression from other unsequenced strains and ongoing evolution by genetic drift. substrain snvs may have a larger predicted functional impact compared to older shared snvs.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary we present a comprehensive catalog of uniformly analyzed genetic variants among  <dig> widely used rat inbred strains based on the rgsc <dig>  assembly. this represents a valuable resource, which will facilitate rat functional genomic research. in line with previous observations, our genome-wide analyses do not show evidence for contribution of multiple ancestral founder rat subspecies to the currently used rat inbred strains, as is the case for mouse. in addition, we find that the degree of substrain variation is highly variable between strains, which is of importance for the correct interpretation of experimental data from different labs.
