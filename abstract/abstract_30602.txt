BACKGROUND
a recent behavioral study demonstrated that the meaningful interaction of two agents enhances the detection sensitivity of biological motion , however, it remains unclear when and how the 'interaction' information of two agents is represented in our neural system. to clarify this point, we used magnetoencephalography and introduced a novel experimental technique to extract a neuromagnetic response relating to two-agent bm perception. we then investigated how this response was modulated by the interaction of two agents. in the present experiment, we presented two kinds of visual stimuli  with two orientations .


RESULTS
we found a neuromagnetic response in the bilateral occipitotemporal region, on average  <dig> –  <dig> ms after the onset of a two-agent bm stimulus. this result showed that interhemispheric differences were apparent for the peak amplitudes. for the left hemisphere, the orientation effect was manifest when the two agents were made to interact, and the interaction effect was manifest when the stimulus was inverted. in the right hemisphere, the main effects of both orientation and interaction were significant, suggesting that the peak amplitude was attenuated when the visual stimulus was inverted or made to interact.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate that the 'interaction' information of two agents can affect the neural activities in the bilateral occipitotemporal region, on average  <dig> –  <dig> ms after the onset of a two-agent bm stimulus, however, the modulation was different between hemispheres: the left hemisphere is more concerned with dynamics, whereas the right hemisphere is more concerned with form information.
