BACKGROUND
post-transcriptional 3′ end processing is a key component of rna regulation. the abundant and essential rna subunit of rnase mrp has been proposed to function in three distinct cellular compartments and therefore may utilize this mode of regulation. here we employ 3′ race coupled with high-throughput sequencing to characterize the 3′ terminal sequences of human mrp rna and other noncoding rnas that form rnp complexes.


RESULTS
the 3′ terminal sequence of mrp rna from hek293t cells has a distinctive distribution of genomically encoded termini  with a portion of these selectively tagged by oligo tails. this profile contrasts with the relatively homogenous 3′ terminus of an in vitro transcribed mrp rna control and the differing 3′ terminal profiles of u <dig> snorna, rnase p rna, and telomerase rna .


CONCLUSIONS
3′ race coupled with deep sequencing provides a valuable framework for the functional characterization of 3′ terminal sequences of noncoding rnas.
