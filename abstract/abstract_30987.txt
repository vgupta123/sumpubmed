BACKGROUND
epidermal growth factor receptor  signaling plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, metastasis, and invasion in various tumors. earlier studies showed that the egfr is frequently overexpressed in non-small-cell lung cancer  and egfr mutations at specific amino acid residues in the kinase domain induce altered responsiveness to gefitinib, a small molecule egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitor. however, the mechanism underlying the drug response modulated by egfr mutation is still largely unknown. to elucidate drug response in egfr signal transduction pathway in which complex dynamics of multiple molecules involved, a systematic approach is necessary. in this paper, we performed experimental and computational analyses to clarify the underlying mechanism of egfr signaling and cell-specific gefitinib responsiveness in three h1299-derived nsclc cell lines; h <dig> wild type , h <dig> with an overexpressed wild type egfr , and h <dig> with an overexpressed mutant egfr l858r .


RESULTS
we predicted and experimentally verified that mig <dig>  which is a known negative regulator of egfr and specifically expressed in h1299l858r cells, synergized with gefitinib to suppress cellular growth. computational analyses indicated that this inhibitory effect is amplified at the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation steps of mek and erk.


CONCLUSIONS
thus, we showed that l858r receptor mutation in combination with expression of its negative regulator, mig <dig>  alters signaling outcomes and results in variable drug sensitivity.
