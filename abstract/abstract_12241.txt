BACKGROUND
glandular trichomes produce a wide variety of commercially important secondary metabolites in many plant species. the most prominent anti-malarial drug artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone, is produced in glandular trichomes of artemisia annua. however, only limited genomic information is currently available in this non-model plant species.


RESULTS
we present a global characterization of a. annua glandular trichome transcriptome using  <dig> pyrosequencing. sequencing runs using two normalized cdna collections from glandular trichomes yielded  <dig>  expressed sequence tags , which assembled into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. performing a second sequencing run only increased the number of genes identified by ~30%, indicating that massively parallel pyrosequencing provides deep coverage of the a. annua trichome transcriptome. by blast search against the ncbi non-redundant protein database, putative functions were assigned to over  <dig>  unigenes, including previously undescribed enzymes likely involved in sesquiterpene biosynthesis. comparison with ests derived from trichome collections of other plant species revealed expressed genes in common functional categories across different plant species. rt-pcr analysis confirmed the expression of selected unigenes and novel transcripts in a. annua glandular trichomes.


CONCLUSIONS
the presence of contigs corresponding to enzymes for terpenoids and flavonoids biosynthesis suggests important metabolic activity in a. annua glandular trichomes. our comprehensive survey of genes expressed in glandular trichome will facilitate new gene discovery and shed light on the regulatory mechanism of artemisinin metabolism and trichome function in a. annua.
