BACKGROUND
the parasitic nematodes ascaris lumbricoides and a. suum are of great public health and economic significance, and the two taxa were proposed to represent a single species. mirnas are known with functions of gene regulations at post-transcriptional level.


RESULTS
we herein compared the mirna profiles of a. lumbricoides and a. suum female adults by solexa deep sequencing combined with bioinformatics analysis and stem-loop real-time pcr. using the a. suum genome as the reference genome, we obtained  <dig> and  <dig> mirna candidates from a. lumbricoides and a. suum, respectively. among which,  <dig> mirnas were shared between the two taxa,  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were a. lumbricoides and a. suum specific. target and function prediction revealed a significant set of targets which are related to ovarian message protein, vitellogenin and chondroitin proteoglycan of the two nematodes. enrichment analysis revealed that the percentages of most predicted functions of the mirna targets were similar, with some taxon specific or taxon enhanced functions, such as different target numbers, specific functions , etc.


CONCLUSIONS
this study characterized comparatively the mirnas of adult a. lumbricoides and a. suum, and the findings provide additional evidence that a. lumbricoides and a. suum represent a single species. due to the fast evolution nature of mirnas and the different parasitic living conditions of humans and pigs, the phenomenon above might indicate a fast evolution of mirnas of ascaris in humans and pigs.
