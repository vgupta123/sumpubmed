BACKGROUND
bean anthracnose is caused by the fungus colletotrichum lindemuthianum  lams.- scrib. resistance to c. lindemuthianum in common bean  generally follows a qualitative mode of inheritance. the pathogen shows extensive pathogenic variation and up to  <dig> anthracnose resistance loci , conferring resistance to specific races, have been described. anthracnose resistance has generally been investigated by analyzing a limited number of isolates or races in segregating populations. in this work, we analyzed the response against eleven c. lindemuthianum races in a recombinant inbred line  common bean population derived from the cross xana × cornell  <dig> in which a saturated linkage map was previously developed.


RESULTS
a systematic genetic analysis was carried out to dissect the complex resistance segregations observed, which included contingency analyses, subpopulations and genetic mapping. twenty two resistance genes were identified, some with a complementary mode of action. the cornell  <dig> genotype carries a complex cluster of resistance genes at the end of linkage group  pv <dig> corresponding to the previously described anthracnose resistance cluster co- <dig>  in this position, specific resistance genes to races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were identified, with one of them showing a complementary mode of action. in addition, cornell  <dig> had an independent gene on lg pv <dig> showing a complementary mode of action for resistance to race  <dig>  resistance genes in genotype xana were located on three regions involving lgs pv <dig>  pv <dig> and pv <dig>  all resistance genes identified in xana showed a complementary mode of action, except for two controlling resistance to races  <dig> and  <dig> located on lg pv <dig>  in the position of the previously described anthracnose resistance cluster co- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
results shown herein reveal a complex and specific interaction between bean and fungus genotypes leading to anthracnose resistance. organization of specific resistance genes in clusters including resistance genes with different modes of action  was also confirmed. finally, new locations for anthracnose resistance genes were identified in lg pv <dig>
