BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  is one of the most expensive diseases of modern swine production & results in annual economic losses and cost the industry over  <dig> million usd in u.s. alone and billions of dollars worldwide. two atypical prrs cases were observed in  <dig> and  <dig> characterized by late-term abortion, fever and sudden increase in sow mortality which persisted for a prolonged period of time.

methods
lungs, lymph nodes and other samples were collected for disease investigation. sequencing of the viral envelope glycoprotein  and nucleocapsid protein  of prrsv was done using the bigdye terminator v <dig>  cycle sequencing kit chemistry. the phylogenetic tree was constructed by using the maximum likelihood method, generated by mega  <dig> ®.


RESULTS
analysis of the orf <dig> and orf <dig> showed high degree of sequence homology to prrsv parent vaccine strain vr- <dig>  respprrsv and other mutant/chimeric virus strains.


CONCLUSIONS
our study suggests that recombination events between vaccine strains and field isolates may contribute to prrsv virulence in the field.
