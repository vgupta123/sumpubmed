BACKGROUND
the free-living amoeba balamuthia mandrillaris may cause fatal encephalitis both in immunocompromised and in – apparently – immunocompetent humans and other mammalian species. rapid, specific, sensitive, and reliable detection requiring little pathogen-specific expertise is an absolute prerequisite for a successful therapy and a welcome tool for both experimental and epidemiological research.


RESULTS
a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay using taqman® probes  was established specifically targeting the rnase p gene of b. mandrillaris amoebae. the assay detected at least  <dig>  genomes of b. mandrillaris grown in axenic culture. it did not react with dna from closely related acanthamoeba , nor with dna from toxoplasma gondii, leishmania major, pneumocystis murina, mycobacterium bovis , human brain, various mouse organs, or from human and murine cell lines. the assay efficiently detected b. mandrillaris dna in spiked cell cultures, spiked murine organ homogenates, b. mandrillaris-infected mice, and cns tissue-dna preparations from  <dig> patients with proven cerebral balamuthiasis. this novel primer set was successfully combined with a published set that targets the b. mandrillaris 18s rrna gene in a duplex real-time pcr assay to ensure maximum specificity and as a precaution against false negative results.


CONCLUSIONS
a real-time pcr assay for b. mandrillaris amoebae is presented, that is highly specific, sensitive, and reliable and thus suited both for diagnosis and for research.
