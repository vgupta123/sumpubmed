BACKGROUND
cell-based regeneration therapies have great potential for application in new areas in clinical medicine, although some obstacles still remain to be overcome for a wide range of clinical applications. one major impediment is the difficulty in large-scale production of cells of interest with reproducibility. current protocols of cell therapy require a time-consuming and laborious manual process. to solve this problem, we focused on the robotics of an automated and high-throughput cell culture system. automated robotic cultivation of stem or progenitor cells in clinical trials has not been reported till date. the system autoculture® used in this study can automatically replace the culture medium, centrifuge cells, split cells, and take photographs for morphological assessment. we examined the feasibility of this system in a clinical setting.


RESULTS
we observed similar characteristics by both the culture methods in terms of the growth rate, gene expression profile, cell surface profile by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, surface glycan profile, and genomic dna stability. these results indicate that autoculture® is a feasible method for the cultivation of human cells for regenerative medicine.


CONCLUSIONS
an automated cell-processing machine will play important roles in cell therapy and have widespread use from application in multicenter trials to provision of off-the-shelf cell products.
