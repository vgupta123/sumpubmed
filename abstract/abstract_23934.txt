BACKGROUND
the maize  red aleurone <dig>  encodes a cyp450-dependent flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase  required for the biosynthesis of purple and red anthocyanin pigments. we previously showed that zmf3’h <dig> is regulated by c <dig>  and r <dig>  transcription factors. the current study demonstrates that, in addition to its role in anthocyanin biosynthesis, the zmf3’h <dig> gene also participates in the biosynthesis of 3-deoxyflavonoids and phlobaphenes that accumulate in maize pericarps, cob glumes, and silks. biosynthesis of 3-deoxyflavonoids is regulated by p <dig>  and is independent from the action of c <dig> and r <dig> transcription factors.


RESULTS
in maize, apiforol and luteoforol are the precursors of condensed phlobaphenes. maize lines with functional alleles of pr <dig> and p <dig>  accumulate luteoforol, while null pr <dig> lines with a functional or non-functional p <dig> allele  accumulate apiforol. apiforol lacks a hydroxyl group at the 3’-position of the flavylium b-ring, while luteoforol has this hydroxyl group. our biochemical analysis of accumulated compounds in different pr <dig> genotypes showed that the pr <dig> encoded zmf3’h <dig> has a role in the conversion of mono-hydroxylated to bi-hydroxylated compounds in the b-ring. steady state rna analyses demonstrated that zmf3’h <dig> mrna accumulation requires a functional p <dig> allele. using a combination of emsa and chip experiments, we established that the zmf3’h <dig> gene is a direct target of p <dig>  highlighting the significance of the zmf3’h <dig> gene for resistance against biotic stress, we also show here that the p <dig> controlled 3-deoxyanthocyanidin and c-glycosyl flavone  defence compounds accumulate at significantly higher levels in pr <dig> silks as compared to pr <dig> silks. by virtue of increased maysin synthesis in pr <dig> plants, corn ear worm larvae fed on pr1; p <dig> silks showed slower growth as compared to pr1; p <dig> silks.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the zmf3’h <dig> gene participates in the biosynthesis of phlobaphenes and agronomically important 3-deoxyflavonoid compounds under the regulatory control of p <dig>
