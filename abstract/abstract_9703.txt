BACKGROUND
manganese peroxidase  of white rot basidiomycetes, an extracellular heme enzyme, is part of a peroxidase superfamily that is capable of degrading the different phenolic compounds. ganoderma, a white rot basidiomycete widely distributed worldwide, could secrete lignin-modifying enzymes , including laccase , lignin peroxidases  and mnp.


RESULTS
after the selection of a g. lucidum strain from five ganoderma strains, the 1092 bp full-length cdna of the mnp gene, designated as g. lucidum mnp , was cloned from the selected strain. we subsequently constructed an eukaryotic expression vector, pao815:: glmnp, and transferred it into pichia pastoris smd <dig>  recombinant glumnp <dig>  was with a yield of 126 mg/l and a molecular weight of approximately  <dig>  kda and a specific enzyme activity of  <dig>  u/l. the rglumnp <dig> could be capable of the decolorization of four types of dyes and the degradation of phenol. phenol and its principal degradation products including hydroquinone, pyrocatechol, resorcinol, benzoquinone, were detected successfully in the experiments.


CONCLUSIONS
the rglumnp <dig> could be effectively expressed in pichia pastoris and with a higher oxidation activity. we infer that, in the initial stages of the reaction, the catechol-mediated cycle should be the principal route of enzymatic degradation of phenol and its oxidation products. this study highlights the potential industrial applications associated with the production of mnp by genetic engineering methods, and the application of industrial wastewater treatment.
