BACKGROUND
toll-like receptor- <dig>  and caspase recruitment domain  <dig>  are important pattern recognition receptors that play a role in the initiation of the inflammatory and subsequent immune response. they have been previously identified as susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel diseases in humans and are, therefore, suitable candidate genes for inflammatory disease resistance in cattle. the objective of this study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the bovine tlr <dig> and card <dig> and evaluate the association of these snps with health and production traits in a population of canadian holstein bulls.


RESULTS
a selective dna pool was constructed based on the estimated breeding values  for scs. gene segments were amplified from this pool in pcr reactions and the amplicons sequenced to reveal polymorphisms. a total of four snps, including one in intron  <dig>  and three in the exon  <dig>  were identified in card15; none were identified in tlr <dig>  canadian holstein bulls  were genotyped and haplotypes were reconstructed. two snps, c.3020a>t and c.4500a>c, were associated with ebvs for health and production traits. the snp, c.3020a>t, for example, was associated with scs ebvs  with an allele substitution effect of  <dig>  score. when compared to the most frequent haplotype hap <dig>  hap <dig> was associated with increased milk  and protein  yield ebvs, and hap <dig> was significantly associated with increased scs ebv. all significant comparison-wise associations retained significance at 8% experimental-wise level by permutation test.


CONCLUSIONS
this study indicates that snp c.3020a>t might play a role in the host response against mastitis and further detailed studies are needed to understand its functional mechanisms.
