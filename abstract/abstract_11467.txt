BACKGROUND
the phytohormone ethylene plays a central role in development and senescence of climacteric flowers. in ornamental plant production, ethylene sensitive plants are usually protected against negative effects of ethylene by application of chemical inhibitors. in campanula, flowers are sensitive to even minute concentrations of ethylene.


RESULTS
monitoring flower longevity in three campanula species revealed c. portenschlagiana  as ethylene sensitive, c. formanekiana  with intermediate sensitivity and c. medium  as ethylene insensitive. we identified key elements in ethylene signal transduction, specifically in ethylene response sensor  <dig> , constitutive triple response  <dig>  and ethylene insensitive 3- like  <dig> and  <dig>  homologous. transcripts of ers <dig>  ctr <dig> and eil <dig> were constitutively expressed in all species both throughout flower development and in response to ethylene. in contrast, eil <dig> was found only in cf and cm. we identified a natural mutation in cmeil <dig> causing a frameshift which resulted in difference in expression levels of eil <dig>  with more than 100-fold change between cf and cm in young flowers.


CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that the naturally occurring 7 bp frameshift discovered in cmeil <dig>  a key gene in the ethylene signaling pathway, correlates with ethylene insensitivity in flowers. we suggest that transfer of the eil <dig> mutation to other plant species will provide a novel tool to engineer ethylene insensitive flowers.
