BACKGROUND
a diverse set of transcripts called 185/ <dig> is strongly expressed in sea urchins responding to immune challenge. optimal alignments of full-length 185/ <dig> cdnas requires the insertion of large gaps that define  <dig> blocks of sequence called elements. the presence or absence of individual elements also defines a specific element pattern for each message. individual sea urchins were challenged with pathogen associated molecular patterns  , and changes in the 185/ <dig> message repertoire were followed over time.


RESULTS
each animal expressed a diverse set of 185/ <dig> messages prior to challenge and a  <dig>  kb message was the predominant size after challenge. sequence analysis of the cloned messages indicated that the major element pattern expressed in immunoquiescent sea urchins was either c <dig> or e <dig> . in contrast, most animals responding to lipopolysaccharide, β- <dig> -glucan or injury, predominantly expressed messages of the e <dig> pattern. in addition to the major patterns, extensive element pattern diversity was observed among the different animals before and after challenge. nucleotide sequence diversity of the transcripts increased in response to β- <dig> -glucan, double stranded rna and injury, whereas diversity decreased in response to lps.


CONCLUSIONS
these results illustrate that sea urchins appear to be able to differentiate among different pamps by inducing the transcription of different sets of 185/ <dig> genes. furthermore, animals may share a suite of 185/ <dig> genes that are expressed in response to common pathogens, while also maintaining a large number of unique genes within the population.
