BACKGROUND
in hiv- <dig> evolution, a 100â€“ <dig>  fold discrepancy between census size
and effective population size  has been
noted. although it is well known that selection can reduce
ne, high in vivo mutation and
recombination rates complicate attempts to quantify the effects of selection
on hiv- <dig> effective size.


RESULTS
we use the inbreeding coefficient and the variance in allele frequency at a
linked neutral locus to estimate the reduction in ne
due to selection in the presence of mutation and
recombination. with biologically realistic mutation rates, the reduction in
ne due to selection is determined by the
strength of selection, i.e., the stronger the selection, the greater the
reduction. however, the dependence of ne on
selection can break down if recombination rates are very high . with biologically likely recombination rates, our model
suggests that recurrent selective sweeps similar to those observed in
vivo can reduce within-host hiv- <dig> effective population sizes by a
factor of  <dig> or more.


CONCLUSIONS
although other factors, such as unequal viral reproduction rates and limited
migration between tissue compartments contribute to reductions in
ne, our model suggests that recurrent
selection plays a significant role in reducing hiv- <dig> effective population
sizes in vivo.
