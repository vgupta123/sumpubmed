BACKGROUND
excessive accumulation of adipose tissue in cultured fish is an outstanding problem in aquaculture. to understand the development of adiposity, it is crucial to identify the genes which expression is associated with adipogenic differentiation. therefore, the transcriptomic profile at different time points  along primary culture development of rainbow trout preadipocytes has been investigated using an agilent trout oligo microarray.


RESULTS
our analysis identified  <dig> genes differentially expressed  that were divided into two major clusters corresponding to the main phases observed during the preadipocyte culture: proliferation and differentiation. proliferation cluster comprised  <dig> genes up-regulated from days  <dig> to  <dig> of culture meanwhile the differentiation cluster was characterized by  <dig> induced genes from days  <dig> to  <dig>  proliferation was characterized by enrichment in genes involved in basic cellular and metabolic processes , cellular remodelling and autophagy. in addition, the implication of the eicosanoid signalling pathway was highlighted during this phase. on the other hand, the terminal differentiation phase was enriched with genes involved in energy production, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. moreover, during this phase an enrichment in genes involved in the formation of the lipid droplets was evidenced as well as the activation of the thyroid-receptor/retinoic x receptor  and the peroxisome proliferator activated receptors  signalling pathways. the whole adipogenic process was driven by a coordinated activation of transcription factors and epigenetic modulators.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, our study demonstrates the coordinated expression of functionally related genes during proliferation and differentiation of rainbow trout adipocyte cells. furthermore, the information generated will allow future investigations of specific genes involved in particular stages of fish adipogenesis.
