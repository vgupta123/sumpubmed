BACKGROUND
despite current knowledge of mutations in  <dig> genes that can cause nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss , no unified clinical test has been developed that can comprehensively detect mutations in multiple genes. we therefore designed affymetrix resequencing microarrays capable of resequencing  <dig> genes mutated in snhl . we present results from hearing loss arrays developed in two different research facilities and highlight some of the approaches we adopted to enhance the applicability of resequencing arrays in a clinical setting.


RESULTS
we leveraged sequence and intensity pattern features responsible for diminished coverage and accuracy and developed a novel algorithm, sprofiler, which resolved >80% of no-calls from gseq and allowed  <dig> %  of sequence to be called, while maintaining overall accuracy at > <dig> % based upon dideoxy sequencing comparison.


CONCLUSIONS
together, these findings provide insight into critical issues for disease-centered resequencing protocols suitable for clinical application and support the use of array-based resequencing technology as a valuable molecular diagnostic tool for pediatric snhl and other genetic diseases with substantial genetic heterogeneity.
