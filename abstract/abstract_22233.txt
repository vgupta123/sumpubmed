BACKGROUND
several reports have associated staphylococcus lugdunensis with the incidence of severe infection in humans; however, the frequency and prevalence of this microorganism and thus the propensity of its antimicrobial drug resistance is unknown in china. the objective of the current study was to determine the prevalence of staphylococcus lugdunensis among six hundred and seventy non-replicate coagulase negative staphylococcus  isolates collected in a 12-month period from clinical specimens in the general hospital of the peopleâ€™s liberation army in beijing, china.


RESULTS
five  of the  <dig> isolates of cons were identified as s. lugdunensis. whereas three isolates were resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, and penicillin and carried the ermc gene and a fourth one was resistant to cefoxitin and penicillin and carried the meca gene, one isolate was not resistant to any of the tested antimicrobials. pulse field gel electrophoretic analysis did not reveal widespread epidemiological diversity of the different isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
hence, even though s. lugdunensis may be yet unrecognized and undefined in china, it still might be the infrequent cause of infection and profound multi-drug resistance in the same population.
