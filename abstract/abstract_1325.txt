BACKGROUND
donepezil improves cognitive functions in ad patients. effects on the brain metabolites n-acetyl-l-aspartate, choline and myo-inositol levels have been reported in clinical studies using this drug. the app/ps <dig> mouse coexpresses the mutated forms of human Î²-amyloid precursor protein  and mutated human presenilin  <dig> . consequently, the app/ps <dig> mouse model reflects important features of the neurochemical profile in humans. in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy  was performed in fronto-parietal cortex and hippocampus  and in striatum . metabolites were quantified using the lcmodel and the final analysis was done using multivariate data analysis. the aim of this study was to investigate if multivariate data analysis could detect changes in the pattern of the metabolic profile after donepezil treatment.


RESULTS
significant differences were observed in the metabolic pattern of app/ps <dig> mice in both str and ctx/hipp before and after donepezil treatment using multivariate data analysis, evidencing a significant treatment effect. a treatment effect was also seen in wild type  mice in str. a significant decrease in the metabolic ratio taurine/creatine  was related to donepezil treatment  in app/ps <dig> mice in both brain regions. furthermore, a significant influence on the choline/creatine  level was observed in treated app/ps <dig> mice compared to untreated in str . finally, there was an increase in glutamate/creatine  in str in wt mice treated with donepezil.


CONCLUSIONS
multivariate data analysis can detect changes in the metabolic profile in app/ps <dig> mice after donepezil treatment. effects on several metabolites that are measurable in vivo using mr spectroscopy were observed. changes in tau/tcr and tcho/tcr could possibly be related to changed cholinergic activity caused by donepezil treatment.
