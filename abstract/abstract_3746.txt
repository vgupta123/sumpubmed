BACKGROUND
norfloxacin like other fluoroquinolones, is known to be mutagenic for salmonella typhimurium ta <dig> strain. this mutagenic effect is due to free oxygen radicals , because it is inhibited by antioxidants such as β-carotene and naturally occurring antioxidants of roheo discolor and other plants. the aim of this work was to evaluate combination therapy with norfloxacin and vitamins c and e, to reduce the possible genotoxic risk associated with fluoroquinolones.

method
the antimutagenicity of α-tocoferol  and ascorbic acid  against norfloxacin-induced mutation was evaluated on s. typhimurium ta <dig>  using the aroclor-1254-induced s <dig> rat liver homogenate. the minimum inhibitory concentration  a measure of the bactericidal effect of norfloxacin, was obtained in vitro by the plate dilution method.


RESULTS
vitamin e  induced a statistically significant reduction  in the mutagenicity of norfloxacin, whereas vitamin c  had no such effect. neither of these vitamins altered the mic for norfloxacin against  <dig> uropathogenic strains of escherichia coli.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that vitamin e is a potent antimutagen that would be worthwhile being used in conjunction with fluoroquinolone treatment. the minimal antimutagenic effect of vitamin c observed under these experimental conditions may have been because vitamin c in the ames test induces a fenton reaction, and if divalent cations are present, it can act as a pro-oxidant rather than an antioxidant. ascorbic acid should be further evaluated in the presence of different divalent cations concentrations.
