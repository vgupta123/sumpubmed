BACKGROUND
increased resistance to antimicrobial agents is a characteristic of many bacteria growing in biofilms on for example indwelling urinary catheters or in intracellular bacterial reservoirs. biofilm-related infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as extended-spectrum β-lactamase -producing enterobacteriaceae, are a major challenge. the aim of this study was to investigate if a carbon monoxide-releasing molecule  has antibacterial effects against esbl-producing uropathogenic e. coli  in the biofilm mode of growth and following colonization of host bladder epithelial cells.


RESULTS
the effect of corm- <dig> was examined on bacteria grown within an established biofilm  by a live/dead viability staining assay. corm- <dig>  exposure for  <dig> h killed approximately  <dig> % of the esbl-producing upec isolate. a non-esbl-producing upec isolate and the e. coli k- <dig> strain tg <dig> were also sensitive to corm- <dig> exposure when grown in biofilms. the antibacterial effect of corm- <dig> on planktonic bacteria was reduced and delayed in the stationary growth phase compared to the exponential growth phase. in human bladder epithelial cell colonization experiments, corm- <dig> exposure for  <dig> h significantly reduced the bacterial counts of an esbl-producing upec isolate.


CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that corm- <dig> has antibacterial properties against multidrug-resistant upec under biofilm-like conditions and following host cell colonization, which motivate further studies of its therapeutic potential.
