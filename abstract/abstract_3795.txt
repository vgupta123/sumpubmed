BACKGROUND
the basidiomycetous yeast xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous has been described as a potential biofactory for terpenoid-derived compounds due to its ability to synthesize astaxanthin. functional knowledge of the genes involved in terpenoid synthesis would create opportunities to enhance carotenoid production. a thiolase enzyme catalyzes the first step in terpenoid synthesis.


RESULTS
two potential thiolase-encoding genes were found in the yeast genome; bioinformatically, one was identified as an acetyl-coa c-acetyltransferase , and the other was identified as a 3-ketoacyl co-a thiolase . heterologous complementation assays in saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that the erg <dig> gene from x. dendrorhous could complement the lack of the endogenous erg <dig> gene in s. cerevisiae, thereby allowing cellular growth and sterol synthesis. x. dendrorhous heterozygous mutants for each gene were created, and a homozygous pot <dig> mutant was also obtained. this mutant exhibited changes in pigment composition and higher erg <dig> transcript levels than the wild type strain.


CONCLUSIONS
the results support the notion that the erg <dig> gene in x. dendrorhous is a functional acetyl-coa c-acetyltransferase essential for the synthesis of mevalonate in yeast. the pot <dig> gene would encode a functional 3-ketoacyl co-a thiolase that is non-essential for cell growth, but its mutation indirectly affects pigment production.
