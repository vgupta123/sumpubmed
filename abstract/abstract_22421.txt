BACKGROUND
gibberellin , a classical phytohormone, plays significant roles in plant growth and development. it shares the important intermediate diphosphate precursor, ggpp, with the main lipophilic bioactive components, diterpenoid tanshinones in salvia miltiorrhiza bunge, one of the most important traditional chinese medicine materials and an emerging model medicinal plant. analysis of ga metabolism and regulation may help to demonstrate the biological functions of gas and the crosstalk between ga metabolism and tanshinone biosynthesis in s. miltiorrhiza. however, genes involved in the conversion of ent-kaurene to gas have not been systematically studied.


RESULTS
through genome-wide prediction and molecular cloning, twenty two candidate gibberellin metabolism pathway genes were systematically identified for the first time. it includes a smko, two smkaos, six smga20oxs, two smga3oxs and eleven smga2oxs, of which twenty genes are novel. the deduced proteins showed sequence conservation and divergence. gibberellin metabolism pathway genes exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns and responded differentially to exogenous ga <dig> treatment, indicating differential regulation of gibberellin metabolism in different tissue types in s. miltiorrhiza. smkao <dig>  smkao <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  and smga2ox4–smga2ox <dig> were significantly up-regulated; smga20ox <dig>  smga3ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig> and smga2ox <dig> were significantly down-regulated; while the responses of many other genes varied among different tissue-types and time-points of ga <dig> treatment, suggesting the complexity of feedback regulation. tanshinone biosynthesis-related genes, such as smcps <dig> and smksl <dig>  were up-regulated in response to ga <dig> treatment. among the  <dig> identified genes, nine responded to yeast extract and ag+-treatment in s. miltiorrhiza hairy roots. moreover, tissue-specifically expressed splice variants were identified for smko, smga20ox <dig>  smga2ox <dig> and smga2ox <dig>  of which smkov <dig>  smga20ox3v and smga2ox11v <dig> were ga3-responsive, suggesting the importance of alternative splicing in regulating ga metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
the results show tissue-specifically expressed, feedback-regulated, stress-responsive and alternatively spliced novel genes and reveal multiple layer regulation of ga metabolism and crosstalk between gibberellin metabolism and tanshinone biosynthesis in s. miltiorrhiza.
