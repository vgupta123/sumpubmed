BACKGROUND
smoothelin-like  <dig>  plays a role in promoting relaxation as well as adaptive responses to exercise, pregnancy and sexual development in smooth and skeletal muscle. investigations of smtnl <dig> transcriptional regulation are still lacking. thus, in this study, we identify and characterize key regulatory elements of the mouse smtnl <dig> gene.


RESULTS
we mapped the key regulatory elements of the smtnl <dig> promoter region: the transcriptional start site  lays - <dig> bp from the translational start codon and a tata-box motif at - <dig> bp was conserved amongst all mammalian smtnl <dig> promoters investigated. the smtnl <dig> proximal promoter enhances expression up to 8-fold in smooth muscle cells and a second activating region lays  <dig> bp further upstream. two repressing motifs were present . the proximal promoter is highly conserved in mammals and contains a mirror repeat sequence. in silico analysis suggests many transcription factors  could potentially bind within the smtnl <dig> proximal promoter sequence.


CONCLUSIONS
smtnl <dig> transcript was identified in all smooth muscle tissues examined to date, albeit at much lower levels than found in skeletal muscle. it is unlikely that multiple smtnl <dig> isoforms exist since a single smtnl <dig> transcription start site was identified in both skeletal and intestinal smooth muscle. promoter studies suggest restrictive control of smtnl <dig> expression in non-muscle cells.
