BACKGROUND
because of the increasing number of diabetic patients, it is important to generate pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene  <dig> -expressing cells, which are capable of differentiating into pancreatic endocrine β cells. mild electrical stimulation was reported to modulate the differentiation of es cells into ectoderm-derived neuronal cells or mesoderm-derived cardiac cells.


RESULTS
in this study, we report that mild electrical stimulation with heat shock  potentiates the differentiation of es cells into definitive endoderm-derived pdx1-expressing cells. met has no effect when applied to early definitive endoderm on differentiation day  <dig>  a  <dig> -fold increase in the proportion of pdx1-expressing cells was observed when stimulation was applied to the late definitive endoderm one day prior to the immergence of pdx1/gfp-expressing cells on differentiation day  <dig>  pdx <dig> mrna was also up-regulated by met. the potentiating effect of met synergized with activin and basic fibroblast growth factor into pdx1-expressing cells. moreover, met stimulation on late definitive endoderm up-regulated heat shock protein  <dig> and activated various kinases including akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p <dig>  and c-jun nh2-terminal kinase in es cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate that met induces the differentiation of pdx1-expressing cells within the definitive endoderm in a time-dependent manner, and suggest useful application for regenerative medicine.
