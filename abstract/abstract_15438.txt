BACKGROUND
we have previously reported that the seed-specific overexpression of sunflower  heat shock factor a <dig>  enhanced seed longevity in transgenic tobacco . in addition, the overexpression of hahsfa <dig> in vegetative organs conferred tolerance to drastic levels of dehydration and oxidative stress.


RESULTS
here we found that the combined overexpression of sunflower heat shock factor a4a  and hahsfa <dig> enhanced all the previously reported phenotypes described for the overexpression of hahsfa <dig> alone. the improved phenotypes occurred in coincidence with only subtle changes in the accumulation of small heat shock proteins  that are encoded by genes activated by hahsfa <dig>  the single overexpression of hahsfa4a in vegetative organs  did not induce shsp accumulation under control growth conditions; neither it conferred thermotolerance. the overexpression of hahsfa4a alone also failed to induce tolerance to severe abiotic stress. thus, a synergistic functional effect of both factors was evident in seedlings.


CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed that hahsfa4a requires hahsfa <dig> for in planta function. our results strongly support the involvement of hahsfa4a and hahsfa <dig> in transcriptional co-activation of a genetic program of longevity and desiccation tolerance in sunflower seeds. these results would also have potential application for improving seed longevity and tolerance to severe stress in vegetative organs.
