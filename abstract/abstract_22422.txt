BACKGROUND
the gene ycl047c, which has been renamed promoter of filamentation gene , has recently been described as a cell component involved in yeast filamentous growth. the objective of this work is to understand the molecular and biological function of this gene.


RESULTS
here, we report that the protein encoded by the pof <dig> gene, pof1p, is an atpase that may be part of the saccharomyces cerevisiae protein quality control pathway. according to the results, Δpof <dig> cells showed increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, heat shock and protein unfolding agents, such as dithiothreitol and tunicamycin. besides, the overexpression of pof <dig> suppressed the sensitivity of Δpct <dig>  a strain that lacks a gene that encodes a phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, to heat shock. in vitro analysis showed, however, that the purified pof1p enzyme had no cytidylyltransferase activity but does have atpase activity, with catalytic efficiency comparable to other atpases involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of proteins . supporting these findings, co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed a physical interaction between pof1p and ubc7p  in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the results strongly suggest that the biological function of pof1p is related to the regulation of protein degradation.
