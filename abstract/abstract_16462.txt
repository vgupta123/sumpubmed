BACKGROUND
investigation of conformational changes in a protein is a prerequisite to understand its biological function. to explore these conformational changes in proteins we developed a strategy with the combination of molecular dynamics  simulations and electron paramagnetic resonance  spectroscopy. the major goal of this work is to investigate how far computer simulations can meet the experiments.

methods
vinculin tail protein is chosen as a model system as conformational changes within the vinculin protein are believed to be important for its biological function at the sites of cell adhesion. md simulations were performed on vinculin tail protein both in water and in vacuo environments. epr experimental data is compared with those of the simulated data for corresponding spin label positions.


RESULTS
the calculated epr spectra from md simulations trajectories of selected spin labelled positions are comparable to experimental epr spectra. the results show that the information contained in the spin label mobility provides a powerful means of mapping protein folds and their conformational changes.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest the localization of dynamic and flexible regions of the vinculin tail protein. this study shows md simulations can be used as a complementary tool to interpret experimental epr data.
