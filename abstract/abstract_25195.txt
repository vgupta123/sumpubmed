BACKGROUND
cardiac morphologic and functional changes consistent with cardiomyopathy have been reported in field cases of calves with accidental doxycycline overdosing. the purpose of this study was to evaluate clinically the cardiac effects of an experimentally-induced doxycycline overdosing in healthy calves.

twelve  <dig> months-old healthy belgian blue calves were studied. six of them  received the normal dose  and the six others  received five times the normal dose  of oral doxycycline for five consecutive days . each calf was clinically examined daily. measurement of serum ast, ck, iso-cks and ldh activities and an echocardiographic examination were performed before  and one day after  the last doxycycline administration. an ecg tracing was recorded at d <dig>  d <dig>  and d <dig> 


RESULTS
in both groups, no clinical, blood, echocardiographic or electrocardiographic changes suggestive of a cardiomyopathy were observed. only a decreased appetite was observed in the calves of the group  <dig> between d <dig> and d <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this trial failed to reproduce cardiac changes reported in accidental doxycycline-poisoning in calves, suggesting that high doses of doxycycline may not be the only etiologic factor of the cardiomyopathy reported in the field cases.
