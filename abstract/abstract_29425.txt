BACKGROUND
crosstalk between the signalling pathways responding to light–dark cycles and those triggering the adaptation of metabolism to the environment is known to occur in various organisms. this interrelationship of light response and nutrient sigalling is crucial for health and fitness. the tropical ascomycete trichoderma reesei  represents one of the most efficient plant cell wall degraders. regulation of the enzymes required for this process is affected by nutritional signals as well as other environmental signals including light. therefore we aimed to elucidate the interrelationship between nutrient and light signaling and how the light signal is transmitted to downstream pathways.


RESULTS
we found that the targets of the light regulatory protein env <dig> in light show considerable overlap with those of the heterotrimeric g-protein components phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig>  detailed investigation of a regulatory interrelationship of these components with env <dig> under conditions of early and late light response indicated a transcriptional mutual regulation between phlp <dig> and env <dig>  which appears to dampen nutrient signalling during early light response, presumably to free resources for protective measures prior to adaptation of metabolism to light. investigating the downstream part of the cascade we found support for the hypothesis that env <dig> is necessary for camp mediated regulation of a considerable part of the core functions of the output pathway of this cascade, including regulation of glycoside hydrolase genes and those involved in nitrogen, sulphur and amino acid metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
env <dig> and phlp <dig> are mutual regulators connecting light signaling with nutrient signaling, with env <dig> triggering the output pathway by influencing camp levels.
