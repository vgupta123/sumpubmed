BACKGROUND
in northwest of china, mini chinese cabbage  is highly valued by consumers, and is widely cultivated during winter in solar-greenhouses where low light  fluence  is a major abiotic stress factor limiting plant growth and crop productivity. the mechanisms with which various nh4
+: no3
− ratios affected growth and photosynthesis of mini chinese cabbage under normal  and low  light conditions was investigated. the four solutions with different ratios of nh4
+: no3
− applied were 0: <dig>  10: <dig>  15: <dig> and 25: <dig> with the set up in a glasshouse in hydroponic culture. the most appropriate nh4
+: no3
− ratio that improved the tolerance of mini chinese cabbage seedlings to ll was found in our current study.


RESULTS
under low light, the application of nh4
+: no3
−  significantly stimulated growth compared to only no3
− by increasing leaf area, canopy spread, biomass accumulation, and net photosynthetic rate. the increase in net photosynthetic rate was associated with an increase in: 1) maximum and effective quantum yield of psii; 2) activities of calvin cycle enzymes; and 3) levels of mrna relative expression of several genes involved in calvin cycle. in addition, glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch and total carbohydrate, which are the products of co <dig> assimilation, accumulated most in the cabbage leaves that were supplied with nh4
+: no3
−  under ll condition. low light reduced the carbohydrate: nitrogen  ratio while the application of nh4
+: no3
−  alleviated the negative effect of ll on c: n ratio mainly by increasing total carbohydrate contents.


CONCLUSIONS
the application of nh4
+:no3
−  increased rbcl, rbcs, fba, fbpase and tk expression and/or activities, enhanced photosynthesis, carbohydrate accumulation and improved the tolerance of mini chinese cabbage seedlings to ll. the results of this study would provide theoretical basis and technical guidance for mini chinese cabbage production. in practical production, the ratio of nh4
+:no3
− should be adjusted with respect to light fluence for successful growing of mini chinese cabbage.
