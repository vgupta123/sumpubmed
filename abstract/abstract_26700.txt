BACKGROUND
the crp-family transcription factor ntca, universally found in cyanobacteria, was initially discovered as a regulator operating n control. it responds to the n regime signaled by the internal 2-oxoglutarate levels, an indicator of the c to n balance of the cells. canonical ntca-activated promoters bear an ntca-consensus binding site  centered at about  <dig>  nucleotides upstream from the transcription start point. in strains of the anabaena/nostoc genera ntca is pivotal for the differentiation of heterocysts in response to n stress.


RESULTS
in this study, we have used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing to identify the whole catalog of ntca-binding sites in cells of the filamentous, heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> three hours after the withdrawal of combined n. ntca has been found to bind to  <dig>  dna regions in the genome of anabaena, which have been ascribed to  <dig>  genes. interestingly, only a small proportion of those genes are involved in n assimilation and metabolism, and 65% of the binding regions were located intragenically.


CONCLUSIONS
the distribution of ntca-binding sites identified here reveals the largest bacterial regulon described to date. our results show that ntca has a much wider role in the physiology of the cell than it has been previously thought, acting both as a global transcriptional regulator and possibly also as a factor influencing the superstructure of the chromosome .
