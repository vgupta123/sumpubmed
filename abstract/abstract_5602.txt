BACKGROUND
toll-like receptor   <dig> is a component of the innate immune system and senses specific pathogen associated molecular patterns  of both microbial and viral origin. cell activation via tlr <dig> and other pattern recognition receptors  contributes to sepsis pathology and chronic inflammation both relying on overamplification of an immune response. intracellular antibodies expressed and retained inside the endoplasmatic reticulum  are applied to block translocation of secreted and cell surface molecules from the er to the cell surface resulting in functional inhibition of the target protein. here we describe generation and application of a functional anti-tlr <dig> er intrabody  which was generated from an antagonistic monoclonal antibody  towards human and murine tlr <dig>  to inhibit the function of tlr <dig>  αt2ib is a scfv fragment comprising the variable domain of the heavy chain and the variable domain of the light chain of mab t <dig>  linked together by a synthetic  <dig> amino acid sequence.


RESULTS
coexpression of αt2ib and mouse tlr <dig> in hek <dig> cells led to efficient retention and accumulation of tlr <dig> inside the er compartment. co-immunoprecipitation of human tlr <dig> with αt2ib indicated interaction of αt2ib with its cognate antigen within cells. αt2ib inhibited nf-κb driven reporter gene activation via tlr <dig> but not through tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  or tlr <dig> if coexpressed in hek <dig> cells. co-transfection of human tlr <dig> with increasing amounts of the expression plasmid encoding αt2ib into hek <dig> cells demonstrated high efficiency of the tlr2-αt2ib interaction. the αt2ib open reading frame was integrated into an adenoviral cosmid vector for production of recombinant adenovirus -αt2ib. transduction with advαt2ib specifically inhibited tlr <dig> surface expression of murine raw <dig>  and primary macrophages derived from bone marrow . furthermore, tlr <dig> activation dependent tnfα mrna accumulation, as well as tnfα translation and release by macrophages were largely abrogated upon transduction of αt2ib. αt2ib was expressed in bmm and splenocytes over  <dig> days upon systemic infection with advαt2ib. systemic transduction applying advαt2ib rendered immune cells largely non-responsive to tripalmitoyl-peptide challenge. our results show persistent paralysis of tlr <dig> activity and thus inhibition of immune activation.


CONCLUSIONS
the generated anti-tlr <dig> scfv intrabody inhibits specifically and very efficiently tlr <dig> ligand-driven cell activation in vitro and ex vivo. this indicates a therapeutic potential of αt2ib in microbial or viral infections.
