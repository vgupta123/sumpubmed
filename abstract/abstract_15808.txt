BACKGROUND
the present study aimed to explore the impact of dietary docosahexaenoic acid  on aspects of the metabolism of atlantic salmon . the effects of diets containing increasing levels of dha  on the liver transcriptome of post-smolt salmon was examined to elucidate patterns of gene expression and responses of specific metabolic pathways. total rna was isolated from the liver of individual fish and analyzed using a custom gene expression 44k feature atlantic salmon oligo-microarray.


RESULTS
the expression of up to  <dig> unique annotated genes was significantly affected by dietary dha inclusion relative to a low dha reference diet. analysis of a total of  <dig> unique genes were found with a significant linear correlation between expression level and dietary dha. gene-set enrichment analysis  identified a range of pathways that were significantly affected by dietary dha content.


CONCLUSIONS
pathways that showed a significant response to dietary dha level included those for long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid elongation, steroid biosynthesis, glycan biosynthesis, protein export and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. these findings suggest that in addition to clear roles in influencing lipid metabolic pathways, dha might also have key functional roles in other pathways distinct from lipid metabolism.
