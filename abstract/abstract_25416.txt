BACKGROUND
given the theoretical proposal that bovine spongiform encephalopathy  could have originated from sheep scrapie, this study investigated the pathogenicity for cattle, by intracerebral  inoculation, of two pools of scrapie agents sourced in great britain before and during the bse epidemic.

two groups of ten cattle were each inoculated with pools of brain material from sheep scrapie cases collected prior to  <dig> and after  <dig>  control groups comprised five cattle inoculated with sheep brain free from scrapie, five cattle inoculated with saline, and for comparison with bse, naturally infected cattle and cattle i.c. inoculated with bse brainstem homogenate from a parallel study. phenotypic characterisation of the disease forms transmitted to cattle was conducted by morphological, immunohistochemical, biochemical and biological methods.


RESULTS
disease occurred in  <dig> cattle, nine inoculated with the pre- <dig> inoculum and seven inoculated with the post- <dig> inoculum, with four cattle still alive at  <dig> months post challenge . the different inocula produced predominantly two different disease phenotypes as determined by histopathological, immunohistochemical and western immunoblotting methods and biological characterisation on transmission to mice, neither of which was identical to bse. whilst the disease presentation was uniform in all scrapie-affected cattle of the pre- <dig> group, the post- <dig> inoculum produced a more variable disease, with two animals sharing immunohistochemical and molecular profile characteristics with animals in the pre- <dig> group.


CONCLUSIONS
the study has demonstrated that cattle inoculated with different pooled scrapie sources can develop different prion disease phenotypes, which were not consistent with the phenotype of bse of cattle and whose isolates did not have the strain typing characteristics of the bse agent on transmission to mice.
