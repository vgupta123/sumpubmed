BACKGROUND
the rate of pubertal development and weaning to estrus interval are correlated and affect reproductive efficiency of swine. quantitative trait loci  for age of puberty, nipple number and ovulation rate have been identified in meishan crosses on pig chromosome 10q  near the telomere, which is homologous to human chromosome 10p <dig> and contains an aldo-keto reductase  gene cluster with at least six family members. akrs are tissue-specific hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases that interconvert weak steroid hormones to their more potent counterparts and regulate processes involved in development, homeostasis and reproduction. because of their location in the swine genome and their implication in reproductive physiology, this gene cluster was characterized and evaluated for effects on reproductive traits in swine.


RESULTS
screening the porcine chori- <dig> bac library with a full-length akr1c <dig> cdna identified  <dig> positive clones and sample sequencing of  <dig> bac clones revealed  <dig> distinct akr1c genes , which mapped to 126â€“ <dig> cm on ssc <dig>  using the imprh7000rad and imnprh212000rad radiation hybrid panels, these  <dig> genes mapped between microsatellite markers swr <dig> and sw <dig>  comparison of sequence data with the porcine bac fingerprint map show that the cluster of genes resides in a  <dig> kb region. twelve snps were genotyped in gilts observed for age at first estrus and ovulation rate from the f <dig> and f <dig> generations of one-quarter meishan descendants of the usmarc resource population. age at puberty, nipple number and ovulation rate data were analyzed for association with genotypes by mtdfreml using an animal model. one snp, a phenylalanine to isoleucine substitution in akr1c <dig>  was associated with age of puberty  and possibly ovulation rate . two snp in akr1c <dig> were significantly associated with nipple number  and another possibly associated with age at puberty .


CONCLUSIONS
akr1c genotypes were associated with nipple number as well as possible effects on age at puberty and ovulation rate. the estimated effects of akr1c genotypes on these traits suggest that the snps are in incomplete linkage disequilibrium with the causal mutations that affect reproductive traits in swine. further investigations are necessary to identify these mutations and understand how these akr1c genes affect these important reproductive traits.
