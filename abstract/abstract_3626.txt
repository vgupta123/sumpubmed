BACKGROUND
mycoplasma hominis is an opportunistic human mycoplasma species that can cause various urogenital infections and, less frequently, extragenital infections. the objective of this work was to study the genetic diversity of this species using a molecular typing method based on multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat  analysis .


RESULTS
the genome content of m. hominis pg <dig> was analysed for tandem repeats , and five of the  <dig> trs identified were selected for use in an mlva assay. the method was based on genescan analysis of vntr loci using multiplex pcr with fluorescent dyes and resolution by capillary electrophoresis. this approach was used on a collection of  <dig> urogenital and extragenital french clinical isolates collected between  <dig> and  <dig>  forty mlva types were found. the discriminatory index of our mlva scheme was  <dig> . using this new typing tool, persistent infection was suggested for six patients and new infection for one patient. furthermore, mother-to-child transmission was confirmed in the two cases studied. application of mlva to a wide range of m. hominis isolates revealed high genotypic diversity and no obvious link between the mlva type and the isolate year of collection, the patientâ€™s age or sex, the anatomical origin of the isolates or resistance to antibiotics was found.


CONCLUSIONS
our mlva scheme highlights the high genetic heterogeneity of the m. hominis species. it seems too discriminatory to be used for large epidemiological studies but has proven its usefulness for molecular studies at the individual level.
