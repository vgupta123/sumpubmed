BACKGROUND
in this study, we have evaluated the immunological status of hepatitis c virus -infected patients aiming at identifying putative biomarkers associated with distinct degrees of liver fibrosis. peripheral blood and tissue t-cells as well as cytokine levels were quantified by flow cytometry.


RESULTS
data analysis demonstrated higher frequency of circulating cd8+ t-cells and tregs along with a mixed proinflammatory/il-10-modulated cytokine pattern in hcv patients. patients with severe liver fibrosis presented lower frequency of circulating cd8+ t-cells, higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines, but lower levels of il- <dig>  in addition to the higher viral load. despite the lower frequency of intrahepatic t-cells and scarce frequency of tregs, patients with severe liver fibrosis showed higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines . the tissue proinflammatory cytokine pattern supported further studies of serum cytokines as relevant biomarkers associated with different liver fibrosis scores. serum cytokine signature showed that mild liver fibrosis is associated with higher il- <dig> serum levels as compared to severe liver disease. there was a clear positive connection of il- <dig> with the tnf node in patients with mild liver fibrosis, whereas there is an evident inverse correlation between il- <dig> with all other cytokine nodes.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest the absence of modulatory events in patients with severe liver damage as opposed to mild fibrosis. machine-learning data mining pointed out tnf and il- <dig> as major attributes to differentiate hcv patients from non-infected individuals with highest performance. in conclusion, our findings demonstrated that hcv infection triggers a local and systemic cytokine ensemble orchestrated by tnf and tuned by il- <dig> in such a manner that mirrors the liver fibrosis score, which highly suggests the relevance of these set of biomarkers for clinical investigations.
