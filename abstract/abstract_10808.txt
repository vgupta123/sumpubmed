BACKGROUND
analogues of vitamin d <dig> are extensively used in the treatment of various illnesses, such as osteoporosis, inflammatory skin diseases, and cancer. functional testing of new vitamin d <dig> analogues and formulations for improved systemic and topical administration is supported by sensitive screening methods that allow a comparative evaluation of drug properties. as a new tool in functional screening of vitamin d <dig> analogues, we describe a genomically integratable sensor for sensitive drug detection. this system facilitates assessment of the pharmacokinetic and pharmadynamic properties of vitamin d <dig> analogues. the tri-cistronic genetic sensor encodes a drug-sensoring protein, a reporter protein expressed from an activated sensor-responsive promoter, and a resistance marker.


RESULTS
the three expression cassettes, inserted in a head-to-tail orientation in a sleeping beauty dna transposon vector, are efficiently inserted as a single genetic entity into the genome of cells of interest in a reaction catalyzed by the hyperactive sb100x transposase. the applicability of the sensor for screening purposes is demonstrated by the functional comparison of potent synthetic analogues of vitamin d <dig> designed for the treatment of psoriasis and cancer. in clones of human keratinocytes carrying from a single to numerous insertions of the vitamin d <dig> sensor, a sensitive sensor read-out is detected upon exposure to even low concentrations of vitamin d <dig> analogues. in comparative studies, the sensor unveils superior potency of new candidate drugs in comparison with analogues that are currently in clinical use.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings demonstrate the use of the genetic sensor as a tool in first-line evaluation of new vitamin d <dig> analogues and pave the way for new types of drug delivery studies in sensor-transgenic animals.
