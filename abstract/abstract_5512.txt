BACKGROUND
accurate analyses of comprehensive genome-wide snp genotyping and gene expression data sets is challenging for many researchers. in fact, obtaining an integrated view of both large scale snp genotyping and gene expression is currently complicated since only a limited number of appropriate software tools are available.


RESULTS
we present snpexpress, a software tool to accurately analyze affymetrix and illumina snp genotype calls, copy numbers, polymorphic copy number variations  and affymetrix gene expression in a combinatorial and efficient way. in addition, snpexpress allows concurrent interpretation of these items with hidden-markov model  inferred loss-of-heterozygosity - and copy number regions.


CONCLUSIONS
the combined analyses with the easily accessible software tool snpexpress will not only facilitate the recognition of recurrent genetic lesions, but also the identification of critical pathogenic genes.
