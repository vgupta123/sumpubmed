BACKGROUND
gata factors 4/5/ <dig> have been implicated in the development of the heart and endodermal derivatives in vertebrates. work in zebrafish has indicated that gata <dig> is required for normal development earlier than gata4/ <dig>  however, the gata <dig> knockout mouse has no apparent embryonic phenotype, thereby questioning the importance of the gene for vertebrate development.


RESULTS
in this study we show that in xenopus embryos gata <dig> is essential for early development of heart and liver precursors. in addition, we have found that in xenopus embryos gata <dig> is important for development of heart and liver primordia following their specification, and that in this role it might interact with gata <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that gata <dig> acts earlier than gata <dig> to regulate development of heart and liver precursors, and indicate that one early direct target of gata <dig> is homeobox gene hex.
