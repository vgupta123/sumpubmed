BACKGROUND
micrornas  regulate gene expression by targeting complementary mrnas for destruction or translational repression. aberrant expression of mirnas has been associated with various diseases including cancer, thus making them interesting therapeutic targets. the composite of secondary structural elements that comprise mirnas could aid the design of small molecules that modulate their function.


RESULTS
we analyzed the secondary structural elements, or motifs, present in all human mirna hairpin precursors and compared them to highly expressed human rnas with known structures and other rnas from various organisms. amongst human mirnas, there are  <dig> are unique motifs, many residing in processing sites. further, we identified motifs in mirnas that are not present in other highly expressed human rnas, desirable targets for small molecules. mirna motifs were incorporated into a searchable database that is freely available.

we also analyzed the most frequently occurring bulges and internal loops for each rna class and found that the smallest loops possible prevail. however, the distribution of loops and the preferred closing base pairs were unique to each class.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, we have completed a broad survey of motifs found in human mirna precursors, highly expressed human rnas, and rnas from other organisms. interestingly, unique motifs were identified in human mirna processing sites, binding to which could inhibit mirna maturation and hence function.
