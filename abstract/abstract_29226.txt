BACKGROUND
body weight and length are economically important traits in foodfish species influenced by quantitative trait loci  and environmental factors. it is usually difficult to dissect the genetic and environmental effects. asian seabass  is an important marine foodfish species with a compact genome . the recent construction of a first generation linkage map of asian seabass with  <dig> microsatellites provides a good opportunity to determine the number and position of qtl, and the magnitude of qtl effects with a genome scan.


RESULTS
we conducted a genome scan for qtl affecting body weight, standard length and condition factors in an f <dig> family containing  <dig> full-sib individuals from a breeding stock by using  <dig> microsatellites evenly covering  <dig> chromosomes. interval mapping and multiple qtl model mapping detected five significant and  <dig> suggestive qtl on ten linkage groups . among the five significant qtl detected, three  controlling body weight, total and standard length respectively, were mapped on the same region near lca <dig> on lg <dig>  and explained  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. the other two qtl affecting body weight, qbw2-b and qbw <dig>  were located on lg <dig> and  <dig>  and accounted for  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. suggestive qtl associated with condition factors are located on six different lgs.


CONCLUSIONS
this study presents the first example of qtl detection for growth-related traits in an f <dig> family of a marine foodfish species. the results presented here will enable further fine-mapping of these qtl for marker-assisted selection of the asian seabass, eventually identifying individual genes responsible for growth-related traits.
