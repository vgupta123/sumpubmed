BACKGROUND
the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is an important mechanism in cancer metastasis. although transcription factors including snail, slug, and twist <dig> regulate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, other unknown transcription factors could also be involved. identification of the full complement of transcription factors is essential for a more complete understanding of gene regulation in this process. chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing  technologies have been used to detect genome-wide binding of transcription factors; here, we developed a systematic approach to integrate existing chip-seq and transcriptome data. we scanned multiple transcription factors to investigate their functional impact on the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in the human a <dig> lung adenocarcinoma cell line.


RESULTS
among the transcription factors tested, impact scores identified the forkhead box protein a <dig>  as the most significant transcription factor in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. foxa <dig> physically associates with the promoters of its predicted target genes. several critical epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition effectors involved in cellular adhesion and cellular communication were identified in the regulatory network of foxa <dig>  including foxa <dig>  fga, fgb, fgg, and fgl <dig>  the implication of foxa <dig> in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via its regulatory network indicates that foxa <dig> may play an important role in the initiation of lung cancer metastasis.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified foxa <dig> as a potentially important transcription factor and negative regulator in the initial stages of lung cancer metastasis. foxa <dig> may modulate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via its transcriptional regulatory network. further, this study demonstrates how chip-seq and expression data could be integrated to delineate the impact of transcription factors on a specific biological process.
