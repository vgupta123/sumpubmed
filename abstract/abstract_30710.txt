BACKGROUND
variability in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis activity has been shown to be influenced by genetic factors and related to great metabolic differences such as obesity. the aim of this study was to investigate molecular bases of genetic variability of the adrenal sensitivity to acth, a major source of variability, in meishan  and large white  pigs, ms being reported to exhibit higher basal cortisol levels, response to acth and fatness than lw. a pig cdna microarray was used to identify changes in gene expression in basal conditions and in response to acth stimulation.


RESULTS
genotype and/or acth affected the expression of  <dig> genes related to transcription, cell growth/maintenance, signal transduction, cell structure/adhesion/extra cellular matrix and protein kinase/phosphatase activity. no change in the expression of known key regulator proteins of the acth signaling pathway or of steroidogenic enzymes was found. however, mdh <dig>  sdha, suclg <dig>  genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid  pathway, were over-expressed in ms pigs. higher tca cycle activity in ms than in lw may thus result in higher steroidogenic activity and thus explain the typically higher cortisol levels in ms compared to lw. moreover, up-regulation of star and ldlr genes in ms and/or in response to acth suggest that differences in the adrenal function between ms and lw may also involve mechanisms requisite for cholesterol supply to steroidogenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides new potential candidate genes to explain genetic variations in the adrenal sensitivity to acth and better understand relationship between hpa axis activity and obesity.
