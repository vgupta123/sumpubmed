BACKGROUND
three types of cell lines have been established from mouse blastocysts: embryonic stem  cells, trophoblast stem  cells, and extra-embryonic endoderm  cells, which have the potential to differentiate into their respective cognate lineages. es cells can differentiate in vitro not only into somatic cell lineages but into extra-embryonic lineages, including trophectoderm and extra-embryonic endoderm  as well. ts cells can be established from es cells by the artificial repression of oct3/ <dig> or the upregulation of cdx <dig> in the presence of fgf <dig> on feeder cells. the relationship between these embryo-derived xen cells and es cell-derived exen cell lines remains unclear, although we have previously reported that overexpression of gata <dig> or gata <dig> induces differentiation of mouse es cells into extra-embryonic endoderm in vitro.


RESULTS
a system in which gata factors were conditionally activated revealed that the cells continue to proliferate while expressing a set of extra-embryonic endoderm markers, and, following injection into blastocysts, contribute only to the extra-embryonic endoderm lineage in vivo. although the in vivo contribution is limited to cells of parietal endoderm lineage, gata-induced extra-embryonic endoderm cells  can be induced to differentiate into visceral endoderm-like cells in vitro by repression of gata <dig>  during early passage, the propagation of gexen cells is dependent on the expression of the gata <dig> transgene. these cells, however, lose this dependency following establishment of endogenous gata <dig> expression.


CONCLUSIONS
we show here that gata-induced extra-embryonic endoderm cells derived from es cells mimic the character of xen cells. these findings indicate that gata transcription factors are sufficient for the derivation and propagation of xen-like extra-embryonic endoderm cells from es cells.
