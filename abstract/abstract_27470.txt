BACKGROUND
the purpose of this study was to sequence and assemble the tobacco mitochondrial transcriptome and obtain a genomic-level view of steady-state rna abundance. plant mitochondrial genomes have a small number of protein coding genes with large and variably sized intergenic spaces. in the tobacco mitogenome these intergenic spaces contain numerous open reading frames  with no clear function.


RESULTS
the assembled transcriptome revealed distinct monocistronic and polycistronic transcripts along with large intergenic spaces with little to no detectable rna. eighteen of the  <dig> orfs were found to have steady-state rna amounts above background in both deep-sequencing and qrt-pcr experiments and ten of those were found to be polysome associated. in addition, the assembled transcriptome enabled a full mitogenome screen of rna câ†’u editing sites. six hundred and thirty five potential edits were found with  <dig> occurring within protein-coding genes, five in trna genes, and  <dig> in non-coding regions. these sites were found in every protein-coding transcript in the tobacco mitogenome.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that a small number of the orfs within the tobacco mitogenome may produce functional proteins and that rna editing occurs in coding and non-coding regions of mitochondrial transcripts.
