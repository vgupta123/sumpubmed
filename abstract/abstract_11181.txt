BACKGROUND
several mutations were present in the genome of streptococcus pneumoniae linezolid-resistant strains but the role of several of these mutations had not been experimentally tested. to analyze the role of these mutations, we reconstituted resistance by serial whole genome transformation of a novel resistant isolate into two strains with sensitive background. we sequenced the parent mutant and two independent transformants exhibiting similar minimum inhibitory concentration to linezolid.


RESULTS
comparative genomic analyses revealed that transformants acquired g2576t transversions in every gene copy of 23s rrna and that the number of altered copies correlated with the level of linezolid resistance and cross-resistance to florfenicol and chloramphenicol. one of the transformants also acquired a mutation present in the parent mutant leading to the overexpression of an abc transporter . the acquisition of these mutations conferred a fitness cost however, which was further enhanced by the acquisition of a mutation in a rna methyltransferase implicated in resistance. interestingly, the fitness of the transformants could be restored in part by the acquisition of altered copies of the l <dig> and l <dig> ribosomal proteins and by mutations leading to the overexpression of the spr <dig> abc transporter that were present in the original linezolid-resistant mutant.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate the usefulness of whole genome approaches at detecting major determinants of resistance as well as compensatory mutations that alleviate the fitness cost associated with resistance.
