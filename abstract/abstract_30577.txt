BACKGROUND
heterodera glycines , the major pathogen of glycine max , undergoes muscle degradation  as it becomes sedentary inside the root. many genes encoding muscular and neuromuscular components belong to the uncoordinated  family of genes originally identified in caenorhabditis elegans. previously, we reported a substantial decrease in transcript abundance for hg-unc- <dig>  the h. glycines homolog of unc- <dig>  during the adult sedentary phase of scn. these observations implied that changes in the expression of specific muscle genes occurred during sarcopenia.


RESULTS
we developed a bioinformatics database that compares expressed sequence tag  and genomic data of c. elegans and h. glycines . we identify h. glycines homologs of c. elegans unc genes whose protein products are involved in muscle composition and regulation. rt-pcr reveals the transcript abundance of h. glycines unc homologs at mobile and sedentary stages of its lifecycle. a prominent reduction in transcript abundance occurs in samples from sedentary nematodes for homologs of actin, unc-60b , unc- <dig>  unc- <dig> , unc- <dig> , unc- <dig> , and the potassium channel unc- <dig> . less reduction is observed for the focal adhesion complex gene hg-unc- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the cehg bioinformatics database is shown to be useful in identifying homologs of genes whose protein products perform roles in specific aspects of h. glycines muscle biology. our bioinformatics comparison of c. elegans and h. glycines genomic data and our hg-unc- <dig> expression experiments demonstrate that the transcript abundance of specific h. glycines homologs of muscle gene decreases as the nematode becomes sedentary inside the root during its parasitic feeding stages.
