BACKGROUND
x chromosomes are subject to dosage compensation in drosophila males. dosage compensation requires cis sequence features of the x chromosome that are present in both sexes by definition and trans acting factors that target chromatin modifying machinery to the x specifically in males. the evolution of this system could result in neutral x chromatin changes that will be apparent in females.


RESULTS
we find that the general chromatin structure of female x chromosomes is distinct from autosomes. additionally, specific histone marks associated with dosage compensation and active chromatin marks on the male x chromosome are also enriched on the x chromosomes of females, albeit to a lesser degree.


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that x chromatin structure is fundamentally different from autosome structure in both sexes. we suggest that the differences between the x chromosomes and autosomes in females are a consequence of mechanisms that have evolved to ensure sufficient x chromosome expression in the soma of males.
