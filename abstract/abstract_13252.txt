BACKGROUND
metabolite, ion and protein translocation into chloroplasts occurs across two membranes, the inner and the outer envelope. solute and metabolite channels fulfill very important functions in integrating the organelles into the metabolic network of the cell. however so far only a few have been identified. here we describe the identification and the characterization of the outer envelope protein of 23 kda, oep <dig> from garden pea.


RESULTS
oep <dig> is found in the entire plant lineage from green algae to flowering plants. it is expressed in all organs and developmental states tested so far. the reconstituted recombinant protein oep <dig> from pea forms a high conductance ion channel with a maximal conductance in the fully open state of 466 ± 14ps at a holding potential of +100 mv . the oep <dig> channel is cation selective  with a voltage dependent open probability of maximal vmem = 0 mv.


CONCLUSIONS
the data indicate that the oep <dig> activity represents a single channel unit and does not assemble into a multiple pore complex like bacterial type porins or mitochondrial voltage dependent anion channel. thus, oep <dig> represents a new member of ion channels in the outer envelope of chloroplasts involved in solute exchange.
