BACKGROUND
streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is an important causative agent of infectious endocarditis, while the pathogenicity of this species is widely unclear. to gain insight into the pathomechanisms and the underlying genetic elements for lateral gene transfer, we sequenced the entire genome of this pathogen.


RESULTS
we sequenced the whole genome of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain atcc baa- <dig>  consisting of a  <dig> , <dig> bp circular dna molecule with a g+c-content of  <dig> % and a novel  <dig>  bp plasmid designated as psgg <dig>  bioinformatic analysis predicted  <dig>  orfs and the presence of  <dig> trnas and  <dig> rrnas in the chromosome. furthermore,  <dig> orfs were detected on the plasmid psgg <dig>  including tetracycline resistance genes tell and tet. screening of  <dig> s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates revealed one plasmid  homologous to psgg <dig>  we further predicted  <dig> surface proteins containing the cell wall-sorting motif lpxtg, which were shown to play a functional role in the adhesion of bacteria to host cells. in addition, we performed a whole genome comparison to the recently sequenced s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain ucn <dig>  revealing significant differences.


CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of the whole genome sequence of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus promotes understanding of genetic factors concerning the pathogenesis and adhesion to ecm of this pathogen. for the first time we detected the presence of the mobilizable psgg <dig> plasmid, which may play a functional role in lateral gene transfer and promote a selective advantage due to a tetracycline resistance.
