BACKGROUND
cells respond to dna damage by activating the phosphatidylinositol- <dig> kinase-related kinases, p <dig> and other pathways to promote cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and/or dna repair. here we report that protein palmitoylation, a modification carried out by protein acyltransferases with zinc-finger and asp-his-his-cys domains , is required for proper dna damage responses.


RESULTS
inhibition of protein palmitoylation compromised dna damage-induced activation of atm, induction and activation of p <dig>  cell cycle arrest at g2/m phase, and dna damage foci assembly/disassembly in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. furthermore, knockout of zdhhc <dig>  a palmitoyltransferase gene identified as an interacting protein for c-abl, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in dna damage response, reproduced most of the defects in dna damage responses produced by the inhibition of protein palmitoylation.


CONCLUSIONS
our results revealed critical roles for protein palmitoylation and palmitoyltransferase zdhhc <dig> in early stages of dna damage responses and in the regulation of atm activation.
