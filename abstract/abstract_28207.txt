BACKGROUND
checkpoint mechanisms prevent cell cycle transitions until previous events have been completed or damaged dna has been repaired. in fission yeast, checkpoint mechanisms are known to regulate entry into mitosis, but so far no checkpoint inhibiting s phase entry has been identified.


RESULTS
we have studied the response of germinating schizosaccharomyces pombe spores to uv irradiation in g <dig>  when germinating spores are irradiated in early g <dig> phase, entry into s phase is delayed. we argue that the observed delay is caused by two separate mechanisms. the first takes place before entry into s phase, does not depend on the checkpoint proteins rad <dig>  cds <dig> and chk <dig> and is independent of cdc <dig> phosphorylation. furthermore, it is not dependent upon inhibiting the cdc10-dependent transcription required for s phase entry, unlike a g1/s checkpoint described in budding yeast. we show that expression of cdt <dig>  a protein essential for initiation of dna replication, is delayed upon uv irradiation. the second part of the delay occurs after entry into s phase and depends on rad <dig> and cds <dig> and is probably due to the intra-s checkpoint. if the germinating spores are irradiated in late g <dig>  they enter s phase without delay and arrest in s phase, suggesting that the delay we observe upon uv irradiation in early g <dig> is not caused by nonspecific effects of uv irradiation.


CONCLUSIONS
we have studied the response of germinating s. pombe spores to uv irradiation in g <dig> and shown that s phase entry is delayed by a mechanism that is different from classical checkpoint responses. our results point to a mechanism delaying expression of proteins required for s phase entry.
