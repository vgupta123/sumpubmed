BACKGROUND
we applied comparative phylogenomics  to investigate s. pneumoniae isolates from west africa, with the aim of providing insights into the pathogenicity and other features related to the biology of the organism. the strains investigated comprised a well defined collection of  <dig> invasive and carriage isolates that were sequenced typed and included eight different s. pneumoniae serotypes  of varying invasive disease potential.


RESULTS
the core genome of the isolates was estimated to be 38% and was mainly represented by gene functional categories associated with housekeeping functions. comparison of the gene content of invasive and carriage isolates identified at least eleven potential genes that may be important in virulence including surface proteins, transport proteins, transcription factors and hypothetical proteins. thirteen accessory regions  were also identified and did not show any loci association with the eleven virulence genes. intraclonal diversity  was observed among some clones including st  <dig> , st  <dig>  and st  <dig> . a constructed phylogenetic tree of the isolates showed a high level of heterogeneity consistent with the frequent s. pneumoniae recombination. despite this, a homogeneous clustering of all the serotype  <dig> strains was observed.


CONCLUSIONS
comparative phylogenomics of invasive and carriage s. pneumoniae isolates identified a number of putative virulence determinants that may be important in the progression of s. pneumoniae from the carriage phase to invasive disease. virulence determinants that contribute to s. pneumoniae pathogenicity are likely to be distributed randomly throughout its genome rather than being clustered in dedicated loci or islands. compared to other s. pneumoniae serotypes, serotype  <dig> appears most genetically uniform.
