BACKGROUND
theauxin efflux carrier pin <dig> is a key mediator of polar auxin transport in developing plant tissues. this is why factors that are supposed to be involved in auxin distribution are frequently tested in the regulation of pin <dig> expression. as a result, diverse aspects of pin <dig> expression are dispersed across dozens of papers entirely devoted to other specific topics related to the auxin pathway. integration of these puzzle pieces about pin <dig> expression revealed that, along with a recurring pattern, some features of pin <dig> expression varied from article to article. to determine if this uncertainty is related to the specific foci of articles or has a basis in the variability of pin <dig> gene activity, we performed a comprehensive 3d analysis of pin <dig> expression patterns in arabidopsis thaliana roots.


RESULTS
we provide here a detailed map of pin <dig> expression in the primary root, in the lateral root primordia and at the root-shoot junction. the variability in pin <dig> expression pattern observed in individual roots may occur due to differences in auxin distribution between plants. to simulate this effect, we analysed pin <dig> expression in the roots from wild type seedlings treated with different iaa concentrations and pin mutants. most changes in pin <dig> expression after exogenous iaa treatment and in pin mutants were also recorded in wild type but with lower frequency and intensity. comparative studies of exogenous auxin effects on pin1pro:gus and pin1pro:pin1-gfp plants indicated that a positive auxin effect is explicit at the level of pin <dig> promoter activity, whereas the inhibitory effect relates to post-transcriptional regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that the pin <dig> expression pattern in the root meristem accurately reflects changes in auxin content. this explains the variability of pin <dig> expression in the individual roots and makes pin <dig> a good marker for studying root meristem activity.
