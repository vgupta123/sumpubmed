BACKGROUND
evidence is accumulating that chronic inflammation may have an important role in prostate cancer . the cox- <dig> polymorphism rs <dig>  has been extensively investigated as a potential risk factor for pca, but the results have thus far been inconclusive. this meta-analysis was performed to derive a more precise estimation of the association.

methods
a comprehensive search was conducted to identify all case-control studies of cox- <dig> rs <dig> polymorphism and pca risk. we used odds ratios  to assess the strength of the association, and 95% confidence intervals  give a sense of the precision of the estimate. statistical analyses were performed by review manage, version  <dig>  and stata  <dig> .


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> available studies were considered in the present meta-analysis, with  <dig> patients and  <dig> controls for rs <dig>  when all groups were pooled, there was no evidence that rs <dig> had significant association with pca under co-dominant, recessive, over-dominant, and allelic models. however, our analysis suggested that rs <dig> was associated with a lower pca risk under dominant model in overall population . when stratifying for race, there was a significant association between rs <dig> polymorphism and lower pca risk in dominant model comparison in the subgroup of caucasians , but not in co-dominant, recessive, over-dominant and allelic comparisons.


CONCLUSIONS
based on our meta-analysis, cox- <dig> rs <dig> was associated with a lower pca risk under dominant model in caucasians.
