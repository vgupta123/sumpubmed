BACKGROUND
the ability to acquire fully human monoclonal antibodies  with pre-defined specificities is critical to the development of molecular tags for the analysis of receptor function in addition to promising immunotherapeutics. yet most of the arriving affinity maturated and complete human immunoglobulin g  molecules, which are actually derived from single human b cells, have not widely been used to study the conserved self antigens  such as cd <dig>  because proper hosts are lacking.


RESULTS
here we developed an optimized protocol for site-directed in vitro immunizing peripheral blood mononuclear cells  by using a selected epitope of human cd <dig>  an essential receptor involved in down-regulation of t cell activation. the resultant stable trioma cell lines constantly produce anti-cd <dig> mab , which contains variable  regions of the heavy chain and the light chain derived from the vh <dig> and vλ human germline genes, respectively, and yet displays an unusual igg <dig> isotype. interestingly, γ4λhucd <dig> has a basic pi not commonly found in myeloid monoclonal igg4λs as revealed by the isoelectric focusing  analysis. furthermore, γ4λhucd <dig> binds specifically, with nanomolar affinity, to an extracellular constituency encompassing the putative second complementarity determining region  of cd <dig>  whereby it can react to activated cd3+ cells.


CONCLUSIONS
in a context of specific cell depletion and conditioned medium,in vitro induction of human abs against a conserved self ag was successfully acquired and a relatively basic mab, γ4λhucd <dig>  with high affinity to cdr <dig> of cd <dig> was thus obtained. application of such a human igg4λ mab with designated cdr <dig> specificity may impact upon and prefer for cd <dig> labeling both in situ and ex situ, as it does not affect the binding of endogenous b <dig> ligands and can localize into the confined immunological synapse which may otherwise prevent the access of whole igg <dig> molecules.
