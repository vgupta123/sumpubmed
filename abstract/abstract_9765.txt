BACKGROUND
it is no longer adequate to choose reference genes blindly. we present the first study that defines the suitability of  <dig> reference genes commonly used in cancer studies  for the normalization of quantitative expression data in the field of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma .


RESULTS
raw expression levels were measured by rt-qpcr in hnscc and normal matched mucosa of  <dig> patients. we analyzed the expression stability using genorm and normfinder and compared the expression levels between subgroups. in hnscc and/or normal mucosa, the four best normalization genes were alas, gapdh, rps <dig> and shad and the most stable combination of two genes was gapdh-shad. we recommend using kalpha-tbp for the study of t1-t <dig> tumors, rpl27-shad for t3-t <dig> tumors, kalpha-shad for n <dig> tumors, and alas-tbp for n+ tumors. act, b2m, gapdh, hmbs, hprt, kalpha, rps <dig>  rps <dig>  shad and tbp were slightly misregulated  between tumor and normal mucosa but can be used for normalization, depending on the resolution required for the assay.


CONCLUSIONS
in the field of hnscc, this study will guide researchers in selecting the most appropriate reference genes from among  <dig> potentially suitable reference genes, depending on the specific setting of their experiments.
