BACKGROUND
plant fatty acid α-dioxygenases  are oxylipin-forming enzymes induced by biotic and abiotic stresses, which also participate in developmental processes. in nicotiana attenuata, herbivory strongly induces the expression of an α-dox <dig> gene. to determine its role, we silenced its expression using agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation with an inverted repeat construct. more than half of the transformed lines showed a severe dwarf growth phenotype that was very similar to the phenotype of tomato plants mutated at a second α-dox isoform. this led us to identify the corresponding α-dox <dig> gene in n. attenuata and examine the regulation of both α-dox genes as well as the consequences of their silencing in plant development and anti-herbivore defense.


RESULTS
the transformed lines exhibiting a dwarf growth phenotype are co-silenced for both α-dox genes resulting in a nearly complete suppression of α-dox activity, which is associated with increases in aba, ja and anthocyanin levels, all metabolic signatures of oxidative stress. the other lines, only silenced for α-dox <dig>  developed similarly to wild-type plants, exhibited a 40% reduction of α-dox activity resulting in a 50% reduction of its main product in planta  and showed no signs of oxidative stress. in contrast to α-dox <dig>  the expression of α-dox <dig> gene is not induced by wounding or elicitors in the oral secretions of manduca sexta. instead, α-dox <dig> is expressed in roots and flowers which lack α-dox <dig> expression, but both genes are equally regulated during leaf maturation. we transiently silenced α-dox gene copies with gene-specific constructs using virus induced gene silencing and determined the consequences for plant development and phytohormone and 2-hot levels. while individual silencing of α-dox <dig> or α-dox <dig> had no effects on plant growth, the co-suppression of both α-dox genes decreased plant growth. plants transiently silenced for both α-dox genes had increased constitutive levels of ja and aba but silencing α-dox <dig> alone resulted in lower m. sexta-induced levels of ja, 2-hot and aba.


CONCLUSIONS
thus, both α-dox isoforms function in the development of n. attenuata. in leaf maturation, the two α-dox genes have overlapping functions, but only α-dox <dig> is involved in root and flower development and only α-dox <dig> functions in anti-herbivore defense.
