BACKGROUND
robert rosen’s metabolism-replacement, or , system can be represented as a compact network structure with a single source and three products derived from that source in three consecutive reactions.  has been claimed to be non-reducible to its components and algorithmically non-computable, in the sense of not being evaluable as a function by a turing machine. if -like structures are present in real biological networks, this suggests that many biological networks will be non-computable, with implications for those branches of systems biology that rely on in silico modelling for predictive purposes.


RESULTS
we instantiate  using the process algebra bio-pepa, and discuss the extent to which our model represents a true realization of . we observe that under some starting conditions and parameter values, stable states can be achieved. although formal demonstration of algorithmic computability remains elusive for , we discuss the extent to which our bio-pepa representation of  allows us to sidestep rosen’s fundamental objections to computational systems biology.


CONCLUSIONS
we argue that the behaviour of  in bio-pepa shows life-like properties.
