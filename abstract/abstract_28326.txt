BACKGROUND
the conjugation of ubiquitin to a substrate protein , which involves a sequential process – e <dig> activation, e <dig> conjugation and e <dig> ligation, is crucial to the regulation of protein function and activity in eukaryotes. this ubiquitin-conjugation process typically binds the last amino acid of ubiquitin  to a lysine residue of a target protein. the high-throughput of mass spectrometry-based proteomics has stimulated a large-scale identification of ubiquitin-conjugated peptides. hence, a new web resource, ubisite, was developed to identify ubiquitin-conjugation site on lysines based on large-scale proteome dataset.


RESULTS
given a total of  <dig>  ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, including  <dig> ubiquitylated peptides, obtained from various resources, this study carries out a large-scale investigation on ubiquitin-conjugation sites based on sequenced and structural characteristics. a twosamplelogo reveals that a significant depletion of histidine , arginine  and cysteine  residues around ubiquitylation sites may impact the conjugation of ubiquitins in closed three-dimensional environments. based on the large-scale ubiquitylation dataset, a motif discovery tool, mddlogo, has been adopted to characterize the potential substrate motifs for ubiquitin conjugation. not only are single features such as amino acid composition , positional weighted matrix , position-specific scoring matrix  and solvent-accessible surface area  considered, but also the effectiveness of incorporating mddlogo-identified substrate motifs into a two-layered prediction model is taken into account. evaluation by five-fold cross-validation showed that pssm is the best feature in discriminating between ubiquitylation and non-ubiquitylation sites, based on support vector machine . additionally, the two-layered svm model integrating mddlogo-identified substrate motifs could obtain a promising accuracy and the matthews correlation coefficient  at  <dig>  % and  <dig> , respectively. furthermore, the independent testing showed that the two-layered svm model could outperform other prediction tools, reaching at  <dig>  % sensitivity,  <dig>  % specificity,  <dig>  % accuracy and the  <dig>  of mcc value.


CONCLUSIONS
the independent testing result indicated the effectiveness of incorporating mddlogo-identified motifs into the prediction of ubiquitylation sites. in order to provide meaningful assistance to researchers interested in large-scale ubiquitinome data, the two-layered svm model has been implemented onto a web-based system , which is freely available at http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/ubisite/. two cases given in the ubisite provide a demonstration of effective identification of ubiquitylation sites with reference to substrate motifs.
