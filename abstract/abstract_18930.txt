BACKGROUND
contact network models have become increasingly common in epidemiology, but we lack a flexible programming framework for the generation and analysis of epidemiological contact networks and for the simulation of disease transmission through such networks.


RESULTS
here we present epifire, an applications programming interface and graphical user interface implemented in c++, which includes a fast and efficient library for generating, analyzing and manipulating networks. network-based percolation and chain-binomial simulations of susceptible-infected-recovered disease transmission, as well as traditional non-network mass-action simulations, can be performed using epifire.


CONCLUSIONS
epifire provides an open-source programming interface for the rapid development of network models with a focus in contact network epidemiology. epifire also provides a point-and-click interface for generating networks, conducting epidemic simulations, and creating figures. this interface is particularly useful as a pedagogical tool.
