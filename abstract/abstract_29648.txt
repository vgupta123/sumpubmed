BACKGROUND
micrornas  are shown to be involved in the regulation of circadian clock. however, it remains largely unknown whether mirnas can regulate the core clock genes .


RESULTS
in this study, we found that mir-142-3p directly targeted the 3’utr of human bmal <dig> and mouse bmal <dig>  the over-expression  and knockdown  of mir-142-3p reduced and up-regulated the bmal1/bmal <dig> mrna and protein levels, respectively. moreover, the expression level of mir-142-3p oscillated in serum-shocked nih3t <dig> cells and the results of chip and luciferase reporter assays suggested that the expression of mir-142-3p was directly controlled by clock/bmal <dig> heterodimers in nih3t <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates that mir-142-3p can directly target the 3’utr of bmal <dig>  in addition, the expression of mir-142-3p is controlled by clock/bmal <dig> heterodimers, suggesting a potential negative feedback loop consisting of the mirnas and the core clock genes. these findings open new perspective for studying the molecular mechanism of circadian clock.
