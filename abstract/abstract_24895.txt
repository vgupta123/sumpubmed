BACKGROUND
many bacterial chromosomes display nucleotide asymmetry, or skew, between the leading and lagging strands of replication. mutational differences between these strands result in an overall pattern of skew that is centered about the origin of replication. such a pattern could also arise from selection coupled with a bias for genes coded on the leading strand. the relative contributions of selection and mutation in producing compositional skew are largely unknown.


RESULTS
we describe a model to quantify the contribution of mutational differences between the leading and lagging strands in producing replication-induced skew. when the origin and terminus of replication are known, the model can be used to estimate the relative accumulation of g over c and of a over t on the leading strand due to replication effects in a chromosome with bidirectional replication arms. the model may also be implemented in a maximum likelihood framework to estimate the locations of origin and terminus. we find that our estimations for the origin and terminus agree very well with the location of genes that are thought to be associated with the replication origin. this indicates that our model provides an accurate, objective method of determining the replication arms and also provides support for the hypothesis that these genes represent an ancestral cluster of origin-associated genes.


CONCLUSIONS
the model has several advantages over other methods of analyzing genome skew. first, it quantifies the role of mutation in generating skew so that its effect on composition, for example codon bias, can be assessed. second, it provides an objective method for locating origin and terminus, one that is based on chromosome-wide accumulation of leading vs lagging strand nucleotide differences. finally, the model has the potential to be utilized in a maximum likelihood framework in order to analyze the effect of chromosome rearrangements on nucleotide composition.
