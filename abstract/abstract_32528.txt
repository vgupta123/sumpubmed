BACKGROUND
research in epistasis or gene-gene interaction detection for human complex traits has grown over the last few years. it has been marked by promising methodological developments, improved translation efforts of statistical epistasis to biological epistasis and attempts to integrate different omics information sources into the epistasis screening to enhance power. the quest for gene-gene interactions poses severe multiple-testing problems. in this context, the maxt algorithm is one technique to control the false-positive rate. however, the memory needed by this algorithm rises linearly with the amount of hypothesis tests. gene-gene interaction studies will require a memory proportional to the squared number of snps. a genome-wide epistasis search would therefore require terabytes of memory. hence, cache problems are likely to occur, increasing the computation time. in this work we present a new version of maxt, requiring an amount of memory independent from the number of genetic effects to be investigated. this algorithm was implemented in c++ in our epistasis screening software mbmdr- <dig> . <dig>  we evaluate the new implementation in terms of memory efficiency and speed using simulated data. the software is illustrated on real-life data for crohn’s disease.


RESULTS
in the case of a binary  trait, the parallel workflow of mbmdr- <dig> . <dig> analyzes all gene-gene interactions with a dataset of  <dig>  snps typed on  <dig> individuals within  <dig> days and  <dig> hours, using  <dig> permutations of the trait to assess statistical significance, on a cluster composed of  <dig> blades, containing each four quad-core amd opteron processor  <dig>  <dig>  ghz. in the case of a continuous trait, a similar run takes  <dig> days. our program found  <dig> snp-snp interactions with a multiple-testing corrected p-value of less than  <dig>  on real-life crohn’s disease  data.


CONCLUSIONS
our software is the first implementation of the mb-mdr methodology able to solve large-scale snp-snp interactions problems within a few days, without using much memory, while adequately controlling the type i error rates. a new implementation to reach genome-wide epistasis screening is under construction. in the context of crohn’s disease, mbmdr- <dig> . <dig> could identify epistasis involving regions that are well known in the field and could be explained from a biological point of view. this demonstrates the power of our software to find relevant phenotype-genotype higher-order associations.
