BACKGROUND
induced pluripotent stem cells  are generated by reprogramming somatic cells into embryonic like state  using defined factors. there is great interest in these cells because of their potential for application in regenerative medicine.


RESULTS
ipsc reprogrammed from murine tail tip fibroblasts were exposed to retinoic acid alone  or in combination with tgf-β <dig> and  <dig>  basic fibroblast growth factor  or bone morphogenetic protein  <dig> . the resulting cells expressed selected putative mesenchymal stem cells  markers; differentiated toward osteoblasts and adipocytic cell lineages in vitro at varying degrees. tgf-beta <dig> and  <dig> derived-cells possessed higher potential to give rise to osteoblasts than bfgf or bmp- <dig> derived-cells while bmp- <dig> derived cells exhibited a higher potential to differentiate toward adipocytic lineage. tgf-β <dig> in combination with ra derived-cells seeded onto ha/tcp ceramics and implanted in mice deposited typical bone. immunofluorescence staining for bone specific proteins in cell seeded scaffolds tissue sections confirmed differentiation of the cells into osteoblasts in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
the results demonstrate that tgf-beta family of proteins could potentially be used to generate murine ipsc derived-cells with potential for osteoblasts differentiation and bone formation in vivo and thus for application in musculoskeletal tissue repair and regeneration.
