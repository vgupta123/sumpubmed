BACKGROUND
next generation targeted resequencing is replacing sanger sequencing at high pace in routine genetic diagnosis. the need for well validated, high quality enrichment platforms to complement the bench-top next generation sequencing devices is high.


RESULTS
we used the wafergen smartchip platform to perform highly parallelized pcr based target enrichment for a set of known cancer genes in a well characterized set of cancer cell lines from the nci <dig> panel. optimization of pcr assay design and cycling conditions resulted in a high enrichment efficiency. we provide proof of a high mutation rediscovery rate and have included technical replicates to enable snp calling validation demonstrating the high reproducibility of our enrichment platform.


CONCLUSIONS
here we present our custom developed quantitative pcr based target enrichment platform. using highly parallel nanoliter singleplex pcr reactions makes this a flexible and efficient platform. the high mutation validation rate shows this platformâ€™s promise as a targeted resequencing method for multi-gene routine sequencing diagnostics.
