BACKGROUND
detecting intracellular bacterial symbionts can be challenging when they persist at very low densities. wolbachia, a widespread bacterial endosymbiont of invertebrates, is particularly challenging. although it persists at high titers in many species, in others its densities are far below the detection limit of classic end-point polymerase chain reaction . these low-titer infections can be reliably detected by combining pcr with dna hybridization, but less elaborate strategies based on end-point pcr alone have proven less sensitive or less general.


RESULTS
we introduce a multicopy pcr target that allows fast and reliable detection of a-supergroup wolbachia - even at low infection titers - with standard end-point pcr. the target is a multicopy motif  discovered in the genome of wmel . arm is found in at least seven other wolbachia a-supergroup strains infecting various drosophila, the wasp muscidifurax and the tsetse fly glossina. we demonstrate that end-point pcr targeting arm can reliably detect both high- and low-titer wolbachia infections in drosophila, glossina and interspecific hybrids.


CONCLUSIONS
simple end-point pcr of arm facilitates detection of low-titer wolbachia a-supergroup infections. detecting these infections previously required more elaborate procedures. our arm target seems to be a general feature of wolbachia a-supergroup genomes, unlike other multicopy markers such as insertion sequences .
