BACKGROUND
accumulating evidence suggests an important role for the enzyme poly polymerase- <dig>  as an integral part of the gene expression regulatory machinery during development and in response to specific cellular signals. parp- <dig> might modulate gene expression through its catalytic activity leading to polyation of nuclear proteins or by its physical association with relevant proteins. recently, we have shown that parp- <dig> is activated during t cell activation. however, the proposed role of parp- <dig> in reprogramming t cell gene expression upon activation remains largely unexplored.


RESULTS
in the present study we use oligonucleotide microarray analysis to gain more insight into the role played by parp- <dig> during the gene expression reprogramming that takes place in t cells upon activation with anti-cd <dig> stimulation alone, or in combination with anti-cd <dig> co-stimulation. we have identified several groups of genes with expression modulated by parp- <dig>  the expression of  <dig> early-response genes to anti-cd <dig> seems to be regulated by parp- <dig> either in a positive  or in a negative manner . likewise, in the presence of co-stimulation , the expression of  <dig> genes is also regulated by parp- <dig> either up  or down . interestingly, parp- <dig> deficiency significantly alters expression of genes associated with the immune response such as chemokines and genes involved in the th1/th <dig> balance.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides new insights into changes in gene expression mediated by parp- <dig> upon t cell activation. pathway analysis of parp- <dig> as a nuclear signalling molecule in t cells would be of relevance for the future development of new therapeutic approaches targeting parp- <dig> in the acquired immune response.
