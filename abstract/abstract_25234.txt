BACKGROUND
complex biological database systems have become key computational tools used daily by scientists and researchers. many of these systems must be capable of executing on multiple different hardware and software configurations and are also often made available to users via the internet. we have used the java data object  persistence technology to develop the database layer of such a system known as the sigpath information management system. sigpath is an example of a complex biological database that needs to store various types of information connected by many relationships.


RESULTS
using this system as an example, we perform a critical evaluation of current jdo technology; discuss the suitability of the jdo standard to achieve portability, scalability and performance. we show that jdo supports portability of the sigpath system from a relational database backend to an object database backend and achieves acceptable scalability. to answer the performance question, we have created the sigpath jdo application benchmark that we distribute under the gnu general public license. this benchmark can be used as an example of using jdo technology to create a complex biological database and makes it possible for vendors and users of the technology to evaluate the performance of other jdo implementations for similar applications.


CONCLUSIONS
the sigpath jdo benchmark and our discussion of jdo technology in the context of biological databases will be useful to bioinformaticians who design new complex biological databases and aim to create systems that can be ported easily to a variety of database backends.
