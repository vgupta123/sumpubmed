BACKGROUND
plants produce a group of aldoxime metabolites that are well known as volatiles and as intermediates in cyanogenic glycoside and glucosinolate biosynthesis in particular plant families. recently it has been demonstrated that aldoximes can also accumulate as part of direct plant defense in poplar. cytochrome p <dig> enzymes of the cyp <dig> family were shown to be responsible for the formation of aldoximes from their amino acid precursors.


RESULTS
here we describe the identification and characterization of maize cyp79a <dig> which was heterologously expressed in yeast and nicotiana benthamiana and shown to catalyze the formation of -phenylacetaldoxime and -indole-3-acetaldoxime from l-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan, respectively. simulated herbivory on maize leaves resulted in an increased cyp79a <dig> transcript accumulation and in elevated levels of l-phenylalanine and -phenylacetaldoxime. although l-tryptophan levels were also increased after the treatment, -indole-3-acetaldoxime could not be detected in the damaged leaves. however, simulated herbivory caused a significant increase in auxin concentration.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that cyp79a <dig> might contribute to the formation of -phenylacetaldoxime in maize. since aldoximes have been described as toxic compounds for insect herbivores and pathogens, the increased accumulation of -phenylacetaldoxime after simulated herbivory indicates that this compound plays a role in plant defense. in addition, it is conceivable that -indole-3-acetaldoxime produced by recombinant cyp79a <dig> could be further converted into the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid after herbivore feeding in maize.
