BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small rna molecules that regulate gene expression by targeting messenger rnas  and causing mrna cleavage or translation blockage. of the  <dig> arthropod mirnas that have been identified, only  <dig> are b. mori mirnas that were predicted computationally; of these, only let- <dig> has been confirmed by northern blotting.


RESULTS
combining a computational method based on sequence homology searches with experimental identification based on microarray assays and northern blotting, we identified  <dig> mirnas, an additional  <dig> plausible mirnas, and a novel small rna in b. mori. the latter, bmo-mir-100-like, was identified using the known mirna aga-mir- <dig> as a probe; bmo-mir-100-like was detected by microarray assay and northern blotting, but its precursor sequences did not fold into a hairpin structure. among these identified mirnas, we found  <dig> pairs of mirnas and mirna*s. northern blotting revealed that some b. mori mirna genes were expressed only during specific stages, indicating that b. mori mirna genes  have developmentally regulated patterns of expression. we identified two mirna gene clusters in the b. mori genome. bmo-mir-2b, which is found in the gene cluster bmo-mir-2a-1/bmo-mir-2a-1*/bmo-mir-2a-2/bmo-mir-2b/bmo-mir-13a*/bmo-mir-13b, encodes a newly identified member of the mir- <dig> family. moreover, we found that methylation can increase the sensitivity of a dna probe used to detect a mirna by northern blotting. functional analysis revealed that  <dig> mirnas may regulate  <dig> b. mori orthologs of the  <dig> known drosophila mirna-targeted genes according to the functional conservation. we predicted the binding sites on the  <dig> 3'utr of b. mori genes;  <dig> targeted genes, including  <dig> target sites, were predicted. of these target sites,  <dig> had perfect base pairing to the seed region of  <dig> mirnas. from the predicted genes,  <dig> genes, each of them with multiple predicted target sites, should be considered excellent candidates for future functional studies. biological classification of predicted mirna targets showed that "binding", "catalytic activity" and "physiological process" were over-represented for the predicted genes.


CONCLUSIONS
combining computational predictions with microarray assays, we identified  <dig> b. mori mirnas,  <dig> of which were mirna*s. we identified a novel small rna and  <dig> plausible b. mori mirnas that could not be located in the available b. mori genome, but which could be detected by microarray. thirteen and  <dig> target genes were predicted according to the functional conservation and binding sites, respectively. identification of mirnas in b. mori, particularly those that are developmentally regulated, provides a foundation for subsequent functional studies.
