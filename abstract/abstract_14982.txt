BACKGROUND
higher plants exhibit a remarkable phenotypic plasticity to adapt to adverse environmental changes. the greater duckweed spirodela, as an aquatic plant, presents exceptional tolerance to cold winters through its dormant structure of turions in place of seeds. abundant starch in turions permits them to sink and escape the freezing surface of waters. due to their clonal propagation, they are the fastest growing biomass on earth, providing yet an untapped source for industrial applications.


RESULTS
we used next generation sequencing technology to examine the transcriptome of turion development triggered by exogenous aba. a total of  <dig> genes showed more than a 4-fold increase compared with  <dig> down-regulated genes in developing turions. the analysis of up-regulated differential expressed genes in response to dormancy exposed an enriched interplay among various pathways: signal transduction, seed dehydration, carbohydrate and secondary metabolism, and senescence. on the other side, the genes responsible for rapid growth and biomass accumulation through dna assembly, protein synthesis and carbon fixation are repressed. noticeably, three members of late embryogenesis abundant protein family are exclusively expressed during turion formation. high expression level of key genes in starch synthesis are aps <dig>  apl <dig> and gbssi, which could artificially be reduced for re-directing carbon flow from photosynthesis to create a higher energy biomass.


CONCLUSIONS
the identification and functional annotation of differentially expressed genes open a major step towards understanding the molecular network underlying vegetative frond dormancy. moreover, genes have been identified that could be engineered in duckweeds for practical applications easing agricultural production of food crops.
