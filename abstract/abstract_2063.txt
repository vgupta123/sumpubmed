BACKGROUND
cholecystokinin octapeptide , the most potent endogenous anti-opioid peptide, has been shown to regulate the processes of morphine dependence. in our previous study, we found that exogenous cck- <dig> attenuated naloxone induced withdrawal symptoms. to investigate the precise effect of exogenous cck- <dig> and the role of cholecystokinin   <dig> and/or  <dig> receptors in morphine dependence, a sh-sy5y cell model was employed, in which the μ-opioid receptor, cck1/ <dig> receptors, and endogenous cck are co-expressed.


RESULTS
forty-eight hours after treating sh-sy5y cells with morphine , naloxone  induced a camp overshoot, indicating that cellular morphine dependence had been induced. the cck receptor and endogenous cck were up-regulated after chronic morphine exposure. the cck <dig> receptor antagonist  at 1–10 μm inhibited the naloxone-precipitated camp overshoot, but the cck <dig> receptor antagonist  did not. interestingly, cck- <dig> , a strong cck receptor agonist, dose-dependently inhibited the naloxone-precipitated camp overshoot in sh-sy5y cells when co-pretreated with morphine. the l- <dig>  significantly blocked the inhibitory effect of exogenous cck- <dig> on the camp overshoot at 1–10 μm, while the ly- <dig>  did not. therefore, the cck <dig> receptor appears to be necessary for low concentrations of endogenous cck to potentiate morphine dependence in sh-sy5y cells. an additional inhibitory effect of cck- <dig> at higher concentrations appears to involve the cck <dig> receptor.


CONCLUSIONS
this study reveals the difference between exogenous cck- <dig> and endogenous cck effects on the development of morphine dependence, and provides the first evidence for the participation of the cck <dig> receptor in the inhibitory effects of exogenous cck- <dig> on morphine dependence.
