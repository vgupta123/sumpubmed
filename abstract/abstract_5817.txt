BACKGROUND
the dspa  gene, coding for a putative sensory histidine kinase, is conserved in plastids  and cyanobacteria. it has been linked with a number of different stress responses in cyanobacteria.


RESULTS
we constructed an insertional mutant of dspa  in synechocystis  <dig>  we found little phenotypic effect during nitrogen starvation. however, when the mutation was combined with deletion of the pta gene coding for phosphotransacetylase, a more significant phenotype was observed. under nitrogen starvation, the pta/dspa double mutant degrades its phycobilisomes less than the wild type and still has about half of its chlorophyll-protein complexes.


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicates that acetyl-phosphate-dependent phosphorylation of response regulator overlaps with dspa-dependent signalling of the degradation of chlorophyll-protein complexes  in synechocystis  <dig>
