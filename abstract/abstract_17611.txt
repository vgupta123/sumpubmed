BACKGROUND
germplasm collections are an important source for plant breeding, especially in fruit trees which have a long duration of juvenile period. thus, efforts have been made to study the diversity of fruit tree collections. even though mango is an economically important crop, most of the studies on diversity in mango collections have been conducted with a small number of genetic markers.


RESULTS
we describe a de novo transcriptome assembly from mango cultivar ‘keitt’. variation discovery was performed using illumina resequencing of ‘keitt’ and ‘tommy atkins’ cultivars identified  <dig>  single-nucleotide polymorphisms  and  <dig> simple-sequence repeats . most of the ssrs  were of trinucleotide with the preponderance of motif n and only  <dig>  % were di-nucleotide ssrs with the mostly of n motif. further investigation of the diversity in the israeli mango collection was performed based on a subset of  <dig> snps. those markers have divided the israeli mango collection into two major groups: one group included mostly mango accessions from southeast asia  and india and the other with mainly of floridian and israeli mango cultivars. the latter group was more polymorphic  and was more of an admixture than the former group. a slight population differentiation was detected , suggesting that if the mango accessions of the western world apparently was originated from southeast asia, as has been previously suggested, the duration of cultivation was not long enough to develop a distinct genetic background.


CONCLUSIONS
whole-transcriptome reconstruction was used to significantly broaden the mango’s genetic variation resources, i.e., snps and ssrs. the set of snp markers described in this study is novel. a subset of snps was sampled to explore the israeli mango collection and most of them were polymorphic in many mango accessions. therefore, we believe that these snps will be valuable as they recapitulate and strengthen the history of mango diversity.
