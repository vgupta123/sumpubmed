BACKGROUND
histone h2b monoubiquitination pathway has been shown to play critical roles in regulating growth/development and stress response in arabidopsis. in the present study, we explored the involvement of the tomato histone h2b monoubiquitination pathway in defense response against botrytis cinerea by functional analysis of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig>  orthologues of the arabidopsis athub1/athub <dig> 

methods
we used the trv-based gene silencing system to knockdown the expression levels of slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> in tomato plants and compared the phenotype between the silenced and the control plants after infection with b. cinerea and pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato  dc <dig>  biochemical and interaction properties of proteins were examined using in vitro histone monoubiquitination and yeast two-hybrid assays, respectively. the transcript levels of genes were analyzed by quantitative real time pcr .


RESULTS
the tomato slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> had h2b monoubiquitination e <dig> ligases activity in vitro and expression of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> was induced by infection of b. cinerea and pst dc <dig> and by treatment with salicylic acid  and 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid . silencing of either slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> in tomato plants showed increased susceptibility to b. cinerea, whereas silencing of slhub <dig> resulted in increased resistance against pst dc <dig>  slmed <dig>  a mediator complex subunit, interacted with slhub <dig> but silencing of slmed <dig> did not affect the disease resistance to b. cinerea and pst dc <dig>  the slhub1- and slhub2-silenced plants had thinner cell wall but increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species , increased callose deposition and exhibited altered expression of the genes involved in phenylpropanoid pathway and in ros generation and scavenging system. expression of genes in the sa-mediated signaling pathway was significantly upregulated, whereas expression of genes in the jasmonic acid /ethylene -mediated signaling pathway were markedly decreased in slhub1- and slhub2-silenced plants after infection of b. cinerea.


CONCLUSIONS
vigs-based functional analyses demonstrate that both slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> contribute to resistance against b. cinerea most likely through modulating the balance between the sa- and ja/et-mediated signaling pathways.
