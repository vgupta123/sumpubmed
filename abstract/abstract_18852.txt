BACKGROUND
equine herpesvirus  <dig> is a gamma-herpesvirus that infects horses worldwide. although ehv- <dig> has been implicated in immunosuppression in foals, upper respiratory tract disease, conjunctivitis, general malaise and poor performance, its precise role as a pathogen remains uncertain. the purpose of the present study was to analyse the incidence of ehv- <dig> in an argentinean horse population and correlate it with age and clinical status of the animals.


RESULTS
a serological study on  <dig> thoroughbred racing horses confirmed the presence of ehv- <dig> in the argentinean equine population. a virus neutralization test showed a total of  <dig>  % animals were sero-positive for ehv- <dig>  an increase in antibodies titre with age as well as infection at earlier ages were observed.

ehv- <dig> was isolated from  <dig> out of  <dig> nasal swabs from horses showing respiratory symptoms. the virus grew slowly and showed characteristic cytopathic effect after several blind passages on rk <dig> cells. the identity of the isolates was confirmed by nested pcr and restriction enzyme assay .


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report on the presence of ehv- <dig> in argentina and adds new data to the virus distribution map. though ehv- <dig> was isolated from foals showing respiratory symptoms, further studies are needed to unequivocally associate this virus with clinical symptoms.
