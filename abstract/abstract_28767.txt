BACKGROUND
annotating mammalian genomes for noncoding rnas  is nontrivial since far from all ncrnas are known and the computational models are resource demanding. currently, the human genome holds the best mammalian ncrna annotation, a result of numerous efforts by several groups. however, a more direct strategy is desired for the increasing number of sequenced mammalian genomes of which some, such as the pig, are relevant as disease models and production animals.


RESULTS
we present a comprehensive annotation of structured rnas in the pig genome. combining sequence and structure similarity search as well as class specific methods, we obtained a conservative set with a total of  <dig>  structured rna loci of which  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, hold strong sequence and structure similarity to structured rnas in existing databases. the rna loci cover  <dig> cis-regulatory element loci,  <dig> lncrna loci,  <dig> conflicts of annotation, and  <dig>  ncrna genes. the ncrna genes comprise  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> ribozymes,  <dig> rrnas,  <dig> snornas,  <dig>  snrnas,  <dig> trnas and  <dig> ncrna genes not belonging to the here fore mentioned classes. when running the pipeline on a local shuffled version of the genome, we obtained no matches at the highest confidence level. additional analysis of rna-seq data from a pooled library from  <dig> different pig tissues added another  <dig> mirna loci, yielding an overall annotation of  <dig>  structured rna loci. this annotation represents our best effort at making an automated annotation. to further enhance the reliability,  <dig> of the  <dig>  structured rnas were manually curated by methods depending on the rna class while  <dig>  were declared as pseudogenes. we further created a multiple alignment of pig against  <dig> representative vertebrates, from which rnaz predicted  <dig>  de novo rna loci with conserved rna structures.  <dig> of the rnaz predictions overlapped with the homology based annotation or novel mirnas. we further present a substantial synteny analysis which includes  <dig>  lineage specific de novo rna loci and  <dig> ncrna loci in the known annotation specific for laurasiatheria .


CONCLUSIONS
we have obtained one of the most comprehensive annotations for structured ncrnas of a mammalian genome, which is likely to play central roles in both health modelling and production. the core annotation is available in ensembl  <dig> and the complete annotation is available at
