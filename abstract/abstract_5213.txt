BACKGROUND
this study aimed at determining the extent of tick infestations in
extensively grazed cattle and assess the efficacy of ecotix®
acaricide  in mvomero district in tanzania. a
total of  <dig> tanzanian short horn zebu  from two farms in two
villages were qualitatively assessed for tick infestations and  <dig> animals
 were separated in their herds and
quantitatively examined to establish the tick load. the animals were grouped
in treatment regime groups , txrg  <dig> being the control
group was treated with water. ecotix® was applied on day 0
for txrg  <dig>  days  <dig> and  <dig> for txrg  <dig> and days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for txrg  <dig> and tick
load was monitored for  <dig> days.


RESULTS
all the animals examined were infested with ticks. the identified ticks were
rhipicephalus appendiculatus , amblyomma
variegatum , r.  microplus , r.
 decoloratus , r. evertsi evertsi  and
r. composites . the overall mean  tick
density on day zero was  <dig> ±  <dig> ticks per animal . the mean tick density on day zero was  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig> 
±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig> ±  <dig>  for groups one, two, three
and four respectively. post-treatment quantitative assessment of tick burden
revealed that the txrg  <dig> animals maintained a tick load throughout the study
period. a significant decrease in tick load in animals in groups txrg  <dig>  3
and  <dig>  with increasing frequency of ecotix®
application was recorded. there was however no significant difference in
tick reduction between txrg  <dig> and  <dig> . thus txrg  <dig> would
be sufficient for the monthly tick treatment and with this regime, the
farmer would save up to  <dig>  usd per animal during six months of dry
season.


CONCLUSIONS
the study revealed a high tick infestation among the tshz kept in extensive
grazing systems in mvomero district and that when treated with
ecotix® as pour-on preparation using a two application
regime per month, the tick control strategy was effective.
