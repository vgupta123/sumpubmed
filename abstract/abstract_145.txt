BACKGROUND
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane  is a persistent estrogenic organochlorine pesticide that is a rodent hepatic tumor promoter, with inconclusive carcinogenicity in humans. we have previously reported that o, p'-ddt elicits primarily pxr/car-mediated activity, rather than er-mediated hepatic responses, and suggested that car-mediated effects, as opposed to er-mediated effects, may be more important in tumor promotion in the rat liver. to further characterize species-specific hepatic responses, gene expression analysis, with complementary histopathology and tissue level analyses were investigated in immature, ovariectomized c57bl/ <dig> mice treated with  <dig> mg/kg o, p'-ddt, and compared to sprague-dawley rat data.


RESULTS
rats and mice exhibited negligible histopathology with rapid o, p'-ddt metabolism. gene expression profiles were also similar, exhibiting pxr/car regulation with the characteristic induction of cyp2b <dig> and cyp3a <dig>  however, pxr-specific target genes such as apoa <dig> or insig <dig> exhibited more pronounced induction compared to car-specific genes in the mouse. in addition, mouse car mrna levels decreased, possibly contributing to the preferential activation of mouse pxr. er-regulated genes cyp17a <dig> and cyp7b <dig> were also induced, suggesting o, p'-ddt also elicits er-mediated gene expression in the mouse, while er-mediated effects were negligible in the rat, possibly due to the inhibitory effects of car on er activities. in addition, o, p'-ddt induced gadd45a, gadd45b and cdkn <dig>  suggesting dna damage may be an additional risk factor. furthermore, elevated blood dhea-s levels at  <dig> h after treatment in the mouse may also contribute to the endocrine-related effects of o, p'-ddt.


CONCLUSIONS
although ddt is known to cause rodent hepatic tumors, the marked species differences in pxr/car structure, expression patterns and ligand preference as well as significant species-specific differences in steroidogenesis, especially cyp17a <dig> expression and activity, confound the extrapolation of these results to humans. nevertheless, the identification of potential modes of action as well as species-specific responses may assist in the selection and further development of more appropriate models for assessing the toxicity of ddt to humans and wildlife.
