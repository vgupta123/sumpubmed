BACKGROUND
in recent years, increasing amounts of genomic and clinical cancer data have become publically available through large-scale collaborative projects such as the cancer genome atlas . however, as long as these datasets are difficult to access and interpret, they are essentially useless for a major part of the research community and their scientific potential will not be fully realized. to address these issues we developed mexpress, a straightforward and easy-to-use web tool for the integration and visualization of the expression, dna methylation and clinical tcga data on a single-gene level .


RESULTS
in comparison to existing tools, mexpress allows researchers to quickly visualize and interpret the different tcga datasets and their relationships for a single gene, as demonstrated for gstp <dig> in prostate adenocarcinoma. we also used mexpress to reveal the differences in the dna methylation status of the pam <dig> marker gene mlph between the breast cancer subtypes and how these differences were linked to the expression of mplh.


CONCLUSIONS
we have created a user-friendly tool for the visualization and interpretation of tcga data, offering clinical researchers a simple way to evaluate the tcga data for their genes or candidate biomarkers of interest.
