BACKGROUND
the set of all mrna molecules present in a cell constitute the transcriptome. the transcriptome varies depending on cell type as well as in response to internal and external stimuli during development. here we present a study of the changes that occur in the transcriptome of chili pepper fruit during development and ripening.


RESULTS
rna-seq was used to obtain transcriptomes of whole serrano-type chili pepper fruits  collected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days after anthesis .  <dig> , <dig> illumina miseq reads were assembled de novo into  <dig>  chili genes. we classified the expression patterns of individual genes as well as genes grouped into biological process ontologies and metabolic pathway categories using statistical criteria. for the analyses of gene groups we added the weighted expression of individual genes. this method was effective in interpreting general patterns of expression changes and increased the statistical power of the analyses. we also estimated the variation in diversity and specialization of the transcriptome during chili pepper development. approximately 17% of genes exhibited a significant change of expression in at least one of the intervals sampled. in contrast, significant differences in approximately 63% of the biological processes and 80% of the metabolic pathways studied were detected in at least one interval. confirming previous reports, genes related to capsaicinoid and ascorbic acid biosynthesis were significantly upregulated at  <dig> daa while those related to carotenoid biosynthesis were highly expressed in the last period of fruit maturation . our rna-seq data was validated by examining the expression of nine genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis by qrt-pcr.


CONCLUSIONS
in general, more profound changes in the chili fruit transcriptome were observed in the intervals between  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> daa. the last interval, between  <dig> to  <dig> daa, included 49% of all significant changes detected, and was characterized predominantly by a global decrease in gene expression. this period signals the end of maturation and the beginning of senescence of chili pepper fruit. the transcriptome at  <dig> daa was the most specialized and least diverse of the four states sampled.
