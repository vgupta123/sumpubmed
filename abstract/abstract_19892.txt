BACKGROUND
somatosensory nerve fibres arising from cell bodies within the trigeminal ganglia  in the head and from a string of dorsal root ganglia  located lateral to the spinal cord convey endogenous and environmental stimuli to the central nervous system. although several members of the transient receptor potential  superfamily of cation channels have been implicated in somatosensation, the expression levels of trp channel genes in the individual sensory ganglia have never been systematically studied.


RESULTS
here, we used quantitative real-time pcr to analyse and compare mrna expression of all trp channels in tg and individual drgs from  <dig> anatomically defined segments of the spinal cord of the mouse. at the mrna level,  <dig> of the  <dig> trp channel genes, trpa <dig>  trpc <dig>  trpc <dig>  trpc <dig>  trpc <dig>  trpm <dig>  trpm <dig>  trpm <dig>  trpm <dig>  trpm <dig>  trpm <dig>  trpm <dig>  trpv <dig>  trpv <dig>  trpv <dig>  trpml <dig> and trpp <dig>  were detectable in every tested ganglion. notably, four trp channels, trpc <dig>  trpm <dig>  trpm <dig> and trpv <dig>  showed statistically significant variation in mrna levels between drgs from different segments, suggesting ganglion-specific regulation of trp channel gene expression. these ganglion-to-ganglion differences in trp channel transcript levels may contribute to the variability in sensory responses in functional studies.


CONCLUSIONS
we developed, compared and refined techniques to quantitatively analyse the relative mrna expression of all trp channel genes at the single ganglion level. this study also provides for the first time a comparative mrna distribution profile in tg and drg along the entire vertebral column for the mammalian trp channel family.
