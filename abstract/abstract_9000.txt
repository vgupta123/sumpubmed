BACKGROUND
expression of a large number of yeast genes is repressed by glucose. the zinc finger protein mig <dig> is the main effector in glucose repression, but yeast also has two related proteins: mig <dig> and mig <dig>  we have used microarrays to study global gene expression in all possible combinations of mig <dig>  mig <dig> and mig <dig> deletion mutants.


RESULTS
mig <dig> and mig <dig> repress a largely overlapping set of genes on 2% glucose. genes that are upregulated in a mig <dig> mig <dig> double mutant were grouped according to the contribution of mig <dig>  most of them show partially redundant repression, with mig <dig> being the major repressor, but some genes show complete redundancy, and some are repressed only by mig <dig>  several redundantly repressed genes are involved in phosphate metabolism. the promoters of these genes are enriched for pho <dig> sites, a novel gggagg motif, and a variant mig <dig> site which is absent from genes repressed only by mig <dig>  genes repressed only by mig <dig> on 2% glucose include the hexose transporter gene hxt <dig>  but mig <dig> contributes to hxt <dig> repression on 10% glucose. hxt <dig> is one of the few genes that are more strongly repressed by mig <dig>  mig <dig> does not seem to overlap in function with mig <dig> and mig <dig>  instead, mig <dig> downregulates the sir <dig> gene encoding a histone deacetylase involved in gene silencing and the control of aging.


CONCLUSIONS
mig <dig> fine-tunes glucose repression by targeting a subset of the mig1-repressed genes, and by responding to higher glucose concentrations. mig <dig> does not target the same genes as mig <dig> and mig <dig>  but instead downregulates the sir <dig> gene.
