BACKGROUND
the temporal and spatial-specific expression pattern of a transcript in multiple tissues and cell types can indicate key clues about its function. while several gene atlas available online as pre-computed databases for known gene models, it’s still challenging to get expression profile for previously uncharacterized  transcripts efficiently.


RESULTS
here we developed locexpress, a web server for efficiently estimating expression of novel transcripts across multiple tissues and cell types in human  as well as in mouse . as a wrapper to rna-seq quantification algorithm, locexpress efficiently reduces the time cost by making abundance estimation calls increasingly within the minimum spanning bundle region of input transcripts. for a given novel gene model, such local context-oriented strategy allows locexpress to estimate its fpkms in hundreds of samples within minutes on a standard linux box, making an online web server possible.


CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge, locexpress is the only web server to provide nearly real-time expression estimation for novel transcripts in common tissues and cell types. the server is publicly available at http://loc-express.cbi.pku.edu.cn.
