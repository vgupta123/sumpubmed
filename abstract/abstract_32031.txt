BACKGROUND
treatment of neuronal pc <dig> cells with atp induces depolarisation and increases intracellular calcium levels via purinergic receptors. in many cell types, sustained elevation of intracellular calcium levels cause changes in gene expression via activation of the transcription factor nfat . we have therefore characterised the signalling pathway by which atp regulates nfat-dependent gene expression in pc <dig> cells.


RESULTS
the activation of nfat transcriptional activity by extracellular atp was characterised with the help of reporter gene assays. treatment of pc <dig> cells with atp elicited a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity . utp, 4-benzoylbenzoyl atp and α,β-methylene atp did not mimic the effect of atp, which was abolished by treatment with the p2x receptor antagonist pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonate . this pharmacological characterisation provides evidence for a critical role of ionotropic p2x receptors. blockade of l-type voltage-dependent calcium channels by nifedipine reduced the response of nfat to atp, indicating that a depolarisation-mediated calcium influx was required for maximal nfat activation. inhibition of store-operated calcium entry by the pyrazole derivative btp <dig> also diminished atp-dependent nfat activation. furthermore, atp-induced nfat activation was associated with the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases erk1/ <dig>  finally, treatment with atp increased the levels of the nfat target transcripts, rcan1- <dig>  and bdnf .


CONCLUSIONS
the present data show that atp induces nfat-dependent changes in gene expression in pc <dig> cells by acting on p2x receptors. maximal nfat activation depends on both depolarisation-induced calcium influx and store-operated calcium entry and requires the activity of the protein phosphatase calcineurin and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.
