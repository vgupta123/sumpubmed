BACKGROUND
loss of chromosome 11q defines a subset of high-stage aggressive neuroblastomas. deletions are typically large and mapping efforts have thus far not lead to a well defined consensus region, which hampers the identification of positional candidate tumour suppressor genes. in a previous study, functional evidence for a neuroblastoma suppressor gene on chromosome  <dig> was obtained through microcell mediated chromosome transfer, indicated by differentiation of neuroblastoma cells with loss of distal 11q upon introduction of chromosome  <dig>  interestingly, some of these microcell hybrid clones were shown to harbour deletions in the transferred chromosome  <dig>  we decided to further exploit this model system as a means to identify candidate tumour suppressor or differentiation genes located on chromosome  <dig> 


RESULTS
in a first step, we performed high-resolution arraycgh dna copy-number analysis in order to evaluate the chromosome  <dig> status in the hybrids. several deletions in both parental and transferred chromosomes in the investigated microcell hybrids were observed. subsequent correlation of these deletion events with the observed morphological changes lead to the delineation of three putative regions on chromosome 11: 11q <dig>  11p13->11p <dig>  and 11p <dig> , that may harbour the responsible differentiation gene.


CONCLUSIONS
using an available model system, we were able to put forward some candidate regions that may be involved in neuroblastoma. additional studies will be required to clarify the putative role of the genes located in these chromosomal segments in the observed differentiation phenotype specifically or in neuroblastoma pathogenesis in general.
