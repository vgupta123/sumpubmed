BACKGROUND
leptin acts not only on hypothalamic centers to control food intake but has additional functions in peripheral tissues, e.g. inhibition of insulin secretion from pancreatic islets. the leptin receptor  is a class i cytokine receptor that mediates activation of stat transcription factors. in this study, we characterise the regulation of inflammation-related genes by leptin in insulinoma cells and compare the effect of transcriptional regulation by leptin with that of other cytokines.


RESULTS
we have used rinm5f insulinoma cells as a model system for a peripheral target cell of leptin. six transcripts encoding inflammation-related proteins were found to be upregulated by activation of leprb, namely lipocalin- <dig>  pancreatitis-associated protein, preprotachykinin- <dig>  fibrinogen-β, tissue-type plasminogen activator  and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase . four of these transcripts  were also induced by the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β . interferon-γ alone had no effect on the leptin-induced transcripts but enhanced the upregulation by il-1β of lipocalin- <dig>  tpa and mnsod mrna levels. experiments with leprb point mutants revealed that the upregulation of the inflammation-related genes depended on the presence of tyrosine- <dig> which mediates the activation of the transcription factors stat <dig> and stat <dig>  reporter gene assays showed that leptin induced the expression of preprotachykinin- <dig> and lipocalin- <dig> on the level of promoter regulation. finally, leptin treatment increased caspase 3-like proteolytic activity in rinm5f cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the present data show that leptin induces a cytokine-like transcriptional response in rinm5f cells, consistent with the proposed function of leptin as a modulator of immune and inflammatory responses.
