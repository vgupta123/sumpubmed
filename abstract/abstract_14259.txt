BACKGROUND
the relationship between species diversity and components of ecosystem stability has been extensively studied, whilst the influence of the genetic component of biodiversity remains poorly understood. here we manipulated both genotypic and allelic richness of the seagrass zostera noltii, in order to explore their respective influences on the resistance of the experimental population to stress. thus far intra-specific diversity was seldom taken into account in management plans, and restoration actions showed very low success. information is therefore needed to understand the factors affecting resistance and resilience of populations.


RESULTS
our results show a positive influence of both allelic and genotypic richness on the resistance of meadows to environmental perturbations. they also show that at the low genotypic  richness levels used in prior experimental approaches, the effects of genotypic and allelic richness could not be disentangled and allelic richness was a likely hidden treatment explaining at least part of the effects hitherto attributed to genotypic richness.


CONCLUSIONS
altogether, these results emphasize the need to acknowledge and take into account the interdependency of both genotypic and allelic richness in experimental designs attempting to estimate their importance alone or in combination. a positive influence of allelic richness on resistance to perturbations, and of allelic richness combined with genotypic richness on the recovery  of the experimental populations is supported by differential mortality. these results, on the key species structuring of one of the most threatened coastal ecosystem worldwide, seagrass meadows, support the need to better take into account the distinct compartments of clonal and genetic diversity in management strategies, and in possible restoration plans in the future.
