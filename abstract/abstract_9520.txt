BACKGROUND
the genus arachis, originated in south america, is divided into nine taxonomical sections comprising of  <dig> species. most of the arachis species are diploids  and the tetraploid species  are found in sections arachis, extranervosae and rhizomatosae. diploid species have great potential to be used as resistance sources for agronomic traits like pests and diseases, drought related traits and different life cycle spans. understanding of genetic relationships among wild species and between wild and cultivated species will be useful for enhanced utilization of wild species in improving cultivated germplasm. the present study was undertaken to evaluate genetic relationships among species  belonging to seven sections of arachis by using simple sequence repeat  markers developed from arachis hypogaea genomic library and gene sequences from related genera of arachis.


RESULTS
the average transferability rate of  <dig> ssr markers tested to section arachis and six other sections was 81% and 59% respectively. five markers  showed 100% transferability. cluster analysis of allelic data from a subset of  <dig> ssr markers on  <dig> wild and  <dig> cultivated accessions grouped accessions according to their genome composition, sections and species to which they belong. a total of  <dig> species specific alleles were detected in different wild species, arachis pusilla exhibited largest number of species specific alleles . based on genetic distance analysis, the a-genome accession icg  <dig>  and the b-genome accession icg  <dig>  were found most closely related to a. hypogaea.


CONCLUSIONS
a set of cross species and cross section transferable ssr markers has been identified that will be useful for genetic studies of wild species of arachis, including comparative genome mapping, germplasm analysis, population genetic structure and phylogenetic inferences among species. the present study provides strong support based on both genomic and genic markers, probably for the first time, on relationships of a. monticola and a. hypogaea as well as on the most probable donor of a and b-genomes of cultivated groundnut.
