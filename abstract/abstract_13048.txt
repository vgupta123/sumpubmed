BACKGROUND
relationship between the level of repetitiveness in genomic sequence and genome size has been investigated by making use of complete prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, but relevant studies have been rarely made in virus genomes.


RESULTS
in this study, a total of  <dig> viruses were examined, which cover 90% of genera. the results showed that simple sequence repeats  is strongly, positively and significantly correlated with genome size. certain repeat class is distributed in a certain range of genome sequence length. mono-, di- and tri- repeats are widely distributed in all virus genomes, tetra- ssrs as a common component consist in genomes which more than  <dig> kb in size; in the range of genome <  <dig> kb, genomes containing penta- and hexa- ssrs are not more than 50%. principal components analysis  indicated that dinucleotide repeat affects the differences of ssrs most strongly among virus genomes. results showed that ssrs tend to accumulate in larger virus genomes; and the longer genome sequence, the longer repeat units.


CONCLUSIONS
we conducted this research standing on the height of the whole virus. we concluded that genome size is an important factor in affecting the occurrence of ssrs; hosts are also responsible for the variances of ssrs content to a certain degree.
