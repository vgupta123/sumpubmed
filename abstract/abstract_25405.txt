BACKGROUND
pigeonpea , one of the most important food legumes of semi-arid tropical and subtropical regions, has limited genomic resources, particularly expressed sequence based  markers. we report a comprehensive set of validated genic simple sequence repeat  markers using deep transcriptome sequencing, and its application in genetic diversity analysis and mapping.


RESULTS
in this study,  <dig>  transcriptome shotgun assembly unigene contigs were assembled from  <dig>  million  <dig> gs-flx sequence reads of separate pooled cdna libraries prepared from leaf, root, stem and immature seed of two pigeonpea varieties, asha and upas  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  genic-ssr loci, excluding homopolymeric and compound repeats, were identified; of which  <dig>  pcr primer pairs were designed for marker development. dinucleotide was the most common repeat motif with a frequency of  <dig> %, followed by tri- , hexa- , tetra-  and pentanucleotide  repeat motifs. primers were synthesized and tested for  <dig> of these loci with repeat lengths of â‰¥ <dig> bp. of these,  <dig> markers were validated for consistent amplification in eight diverse pigeonpea varieties;  <dig> were found to be polymorphic on agarose gel electrophoresis. genetic diversity analysis was done on  <dig> pigeonpea varieties and eight wild species using  <dig> highly polymorphic genic-ssr markers. the number of alleles at these loci ranged from 4- <dig> and the polymorphism information content values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . neighbor-joining dendrogram showed distinct separation of the different groups of pigeonpea cultivars and wild species. deep transcriptome sequencing of the two parental lines helped in silico identification of polymorphic genic-ssr loci to facilitate the rapid development of an intra-species reference genetic map, a subset of which was validated for expected allelic segregation in the reference mapping population.


CONCLUSIONS
we developed  <dig> validated genic-ssr markers in pigeonpea using deep transcriptome sequencing. from these,  <dig> highly polymorphic markers were used to evaluate the genetic relationship among species of the genus cajanus. a comprehensive set of genic-ssr markers was developed as an important genomic resource for diversity analysis and genetic mapping in pigeonpea.
