BACKGROUND
telomeres have crucial meiosis-specific roles in the orderly reduction of chromosome numbers and in ensuring the integrity of the genome during meiosis. one such role is the attachment of telomeres to trans-nuclear envelope protein complexes that connect telomeres to motor proteins in the cytoplasm. these trans-nuclear envelope connections between telomeres and cytoplasmic motor proteins permit the active movement of telomeres and chromosomes during the first meiotic prophase. movements of chromosomes/telomeres facilitate the meiotic recombination process, and allow high fidelity pairing of homologous chromosomes. pairing of homologous chromosomes is a prerequisite for their correct segregation during the first meiotic division. although inner-nuclear envelope proteins, such as sun <dig> and potentially sun <dig>  are known to bind and recruit meiotic telomeres, these proteins are not meiosis-specific, therefore cannot solely account for telomere-nuclear envelope attachment and/or for other meiosis-specific characteristics of telomeres in mammals.


RESULTS
we identify ccdc <dig>  alternatively named terb <dig>  as a meiosis-specific protein that localizes to telomeres from leptotene to diplotene stages of the first meiotic prophase. ccdc <dig> and sun <dig> associate with telomeres almost concurrently at the onset of prophase, indicating a possible role for ccdc <dig> in telomere-nuclear envelope interactions and/or telomere movements. consistent with this scenario, ccdc <dig> is missing from most telomeres that fail to connect to sun <dig> protein in spermatocytes lacking the meiosis-specific cohesin smc1b. smc1b-deficient spermatocytes display both reduced efficiency in telomere-nuclear envelope attachment and reduced stability of telomeres specifically during meiotic prophase. importantly, ccdc <dig> associates with telomeres in sun1-deficient spermatocytes, which strongly indicates that localization of ccdc <dig> to telomeres does not require telomere-nuclear envelope attachment.


CONCLUSIONS
ccdc <dig> is a meiosis-specific telomere associated protein. based on our findings we propose that ccdc <dig> plays a role in meiosis-specific telomere functions. in particular, we favour the possibility that ccdc <dig> is involved in telomere-nuclear envelope attachment and/or the stabilization of meiotic telomeres. these conclusions are consistent with the findings of an independently initiated study that analysed ccdc79/terb <dig> functions.
