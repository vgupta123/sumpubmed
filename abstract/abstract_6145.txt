BACKGROUND
ubiquitin  ligases interact with specific ubiquitin conjugating  enzymes to ubiquitinate particular substrate proteins. as the combination of e <dig> and e <dig> dictates the type and biological consequence of ubiquitination, it is important to understand the basis of specificity in e2:e <dig> interactions. the e <dig> ligase chip interacts with hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> and ubiquitinates client proteins that are chaperoned by these heat shock proteins. chip interacts with two types of e <dig> enzymes, ubch <dig> and ubc13-uev1a. it is unclear, however, why chip binds these e <dig> enzymes rather than others, and whether chip interacts preferentially with ubch <dig> or ubc13-uev1a, which form different types of polyubiquitin chains.


RESULTS
the  <dig>  Ã… crystal structure of the chip u-box domain complexed with ubch5a shows that chip binds to ubch <dig> and ubc <dig> through similar specificity determinants, including a key s-p-a motif on the e <dig> enzymes. the determinants make different relative contributions to the overall interactions between chip and the two e <dig> enzymes. chip undergoes auto-ubiquitination by ubch <dig> but not by ubc13-uev1a. instead, chip drives the formation of unanchored polyubiquitin by ubc13-uev1a. chip also interacts productively with the class iii e <dig> enzyme ube2e <dig>  in which the ubch5- and ubc13-binding specificity determinants are highly conserved.


CONCLUSIONS
the chip:ubch5a structure emphasizes the importance of specificity determinants located on the long loops and central helix of the chip u-box, and on the n-terminal helix and loops l <dig> and l <dig> of its cognate e <dig> enzymes. the s-p-a motif and other specificity determinants define the set of cognate e <dig> enzymes for chip, which likely includes several class iii e <dig> enzymes. chip's interactions with ubch <dig>  ube2e <dig> and ubc13-uev1a are consistent with the notion that ubc13-uev1a may work sequentially with other e <dig> enzymes to carry out k63-linked polyubiquitination of chip substrates.
