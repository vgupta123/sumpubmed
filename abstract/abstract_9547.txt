BACKGROUND
1e <dig> monoclonal antibody is a murine anti-idiotypic antibody that mimics n-glycolyl-gm <dig> gangliosides. this antibody has been tested as an anti-idiotypic cancer vaccine, adjuvated in al <dig>  in several clinical trials for melanoma, breast, and lung cancer. during early clinical development this mab was obtained in vivo from mice ascites fluid. currently, the production process of 1e <dig> is being transferred from the in vivo to a bioreactor-based method.


RESULTS
here, we present a comprehensive molecular and immunological characterization of 1e <dig> produced by the two different production processes in order to determine the impact of the manufacturing process in vaccine performance. we observed differences in glycosylation pattern, charge heterogeneity and structural stability between in vivo-produced 1e <dig> and bioreactor-obtained 1e <dig>  interestingly, these modifications had no significant impact on the immune responses elicited in two different animal models.


CONCLUSIONS
changes in 1e <dig> primary structure like glycosylation; asparagine deamidation and oxidation affected 1e <dig> structural stability but did not affect the immune response elicited in mice and chickens when compared to 1e <dig> produced in mice.
