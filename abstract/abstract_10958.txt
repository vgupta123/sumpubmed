BACKGROUND
the work presented here provides the first intensive insight into the bacterial populations in the digestive tract of the north american moose . eight free-range moose on natural pasture were sampled, producing eight rumen samples and six colon samples. second generation  phylochips were used to determine the presence of hundreds of operational taxonomic units , representing multiple closely related species/strains , found in the rumen and colon of the moose.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> unique otus were used for analysis, which passed the fluorescence and the positive fraction thresholds. there were  <dig> otus, representing  <dig> bacterial families, which were found exclusively in the rumen samples: lachnospiraceae, prevotellaceae and several unclassified families, whereas there were  <dig> otus, representing  <dig> bacterial families, which were found exclusively in the colon samples: clostridiaceae, enterobacteriaceae and several unclassified families. overall, there were  <dig> otus that were found in 100% of the samples. the firmicutes were the most dominant bacteria phylum in both the rumen and the colon. microarray data available at arrayexpress, accession number e-mexp- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
using phylotrac and unifrac computer software, samples clustered into two distinct groups: rumen and colon, confirming that the rumen and colon are distinct environments. there was an apparent correlation of age to cluster, which will be validated by a larger sample size in future studies, but there were no detectable trends based upon gender.
