BACKGROUND
in recent years, the application of nanotechnology in several fields of bioscience and biomedicine has been studied. the use of nanoparticles for the targeted delivery of substances has been given special attention and is of particular interest in the treatment of plant diseases. in this work both the penetration and the movement of iron-carbon nanoparticles in plant cells have been analyzed in living plants of cucurbita pepo.


RESULTS
the nanoparticles were applied in planta using two different application methods, injection and spraying, and magnets were used to retain the particles in movement in specific areas of the plant. the main experimental approach, using correlative light and electron microscopy provided evidence of intracellular localization of nanoparticles and their displacement from the application point. long range movement of the particles through the plant body was also detected, particles having been found near the magnets used to immobilize and concentrate them. furthermore, cell response to the nanoparticle presence was detected.


CONCLUSIONS
nanoparticles were capable of penetrating living plant tissues and migrating to different regions of the plant, although movements over short distances seemed to be favoured. these findings show that the use of carbon coated magnetic particles for directed delivery of substances into plant cells is a feasible application.
