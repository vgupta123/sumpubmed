BACKGROUND
specific histone modifications play important roles in chromatin functions; i.e., activation or repression of gene transcription. this participation must occur as a dynamic process. nevertheless, most of the histone modification maps reported to date provide only static pictures that link certain modifications with active or silenced states. this study, however, focuses on the global histone modification variation that occurs in response to the transcriptional reprogramming produced by a physiological perturbation in yeast.


RESULTS
we did a genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis for eight specific histone modifications before and after saline stress. the most striking change was rapid acetylation loss in lysines  <dig> and  <dig> of h <dig> and in lysine  <dig> of h <dig>  associated with gene repression. the genes activated by saline stress increased the acetylation levels at these same sites, but this acetylation process was quantitatively minor if compared to that of the deacetylation of repressed genes. the changes in the tri-methylation of lysines  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of h <dig> and the di-methylation of lysine  <dig> of h <dig> were slighter than those of acetylation. furthermore, we produced new genome-wide maps for seven histone modifications, and we analyzed, for the first time in s. cerevisiae, the genome-wide profile of acetylation of lysine  <dig> of h <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this research reveals that the short-term changes observed in the post-stress methylation of histones are much more moderate than those of acetylation, and that the dynamics of the acetylation state of histones during activation or repression of transcription is a much quicker process than methylation.
