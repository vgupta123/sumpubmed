BACKGROUND
autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome  is a rare inherited disorder characterized by defective function of fas, autoimmune manifestations that predominantly involve blood cells, polyclonal accumulation of lymphocytes in the spleen and lymph nodes with lymphoadenomegaly and/or splenomegaly, and expansion of tcrαβ+ cd4/cd <dig> double-negative  t cells in the peripheral blood. most frequently, it is due to fas gene mutations, causing alps type ia . however, other mutations, namely of the fasl gene  and the caspase- <dig> gene  are occasionally detected, whereas some patients do not present any known mutations . recently, mutations of the nras gene have been suggested to cause alps-iv.


RESULTS
this work reports two patients that are combined heterozygous for single nucleotide substitutions in the fas and caspase- <dig> genes. the first patient carried a splice site defect suppressing allele expression in the fas gene and the p501l substitution in caspase- <dig>  the second had a mutation causing a premature stop codon  in the fas gene and the y446c substitution in caspase- <dig>  fas expression was reduced and caspase- <dig> activity was decreased in both patients. in both patients, the mutations were inherited from distinct healthy parents.


CONCLUSIONS
these data strongly suggest that co-transmission of these mutation was responsible for alps.
