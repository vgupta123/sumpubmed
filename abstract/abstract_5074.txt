BACKGROUND
during a viral infection, the intracellular rig-i-like receptors  sense viral rna and signal through the mitochondrial antiviral signaling adaptor mavs  whose activation triggers a rapid production of type i interferons  and of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the transcription factors irf3/irf <dig> and nf-κb, respectively. while mavs is essential for this signaling and known to operate through the scaffold protein nemo and the protein kinase tbk <dig> that phosphorylates irf <dig>  its mechanism of action and regulation remain unclear.


RESULTS
we report here that rlr activation triggers mavs ubiquitination on lysine  <dig> and  <dig> by the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase trim <dig> and marks it for proteasomal degradation concomitantly with downstream signaling. inhibition of this mavs degradation with a proteasome inhibitor does not affect nf-κb signaling but it hampers irf <dig> activation, and nemo and tbk <dig>  two essential mediators in type i ifn production, are retained at the mitochondria.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that mavs functions as a recruitment platform that assembles a signaling complex involving nemo and tbk <dig>  and that the proteasome-mediated mavs degradation is required to release the signaling complex into the cytosol, allowing irf <dig> phosphorylation by tbk <dig>
