BACKGROUND
self-referential cognitions are important for self-monitoring and self-regulation. previous studies have addressed the neural correlates of self-referential processes in response to or related to external stimuli. we here investigated brain activity associated with a short, exclusively mental process of self-reflection in the absence of external stimuli or behavioural requirements. healthy subjects reflected either on themselves, a personally known or an unknown person during functional magnetic resonance imaging . the reflection period was initialized by a cue and followed by photographs of the respective persons .


RESULTS
self-reflection, compared with reflecting on the other persons and to a major part also compared with perceiving photographs of one-self, was associated with more prominent dorsomedial and lateral prefrontal, insular, anterior and posterior cingulate activations. whereas some of these areas showed activity in the “other”-conditions as well, self-selective characteristics were revealed in right dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex for self-reflection; in anterior cingulate cortex for self-perception and in the left inferior parietal lobe for self-reflection and -perception.


CONCLUSIONS
altogether, cingulate, medial and lateral prefrontal, insular and inferior parietal regions show relevance for self-related cognitions, with in part self-specificity in terms of comparison with the known-, unknown- and perception-conditions. notably, the results are obtained here without behavioural response supporting the reliability of this methodological approach of applying a solely mental intervention. we suggest considering the reported structures when investigating psychopathologically affected self-related processing.
