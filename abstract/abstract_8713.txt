BACKGROUND
litchi is an evergreen woody tree widely cultivated in subtropical and tropical regions. defective flowering is a major challenge for litchi production in time of climate change and global warming. previous studies have shown that high temperature conditions encourage the growth of rudimentary leaves in panicles and suppress litchi flowering, while reactive oxygen species  generated by methyl viologen dichloride hydrate  promote flowering and abortion of rudimentary leaves. to understand the molecular function of the ros-induced abortion of rudimentary leaves in litchi, we sequenced and de novo assembled the litchi transcriptome.


RESULTS
our assembly encompassed  <dig>  unigenes with a mean size of 710 bp, and over 58%  of unigenes showed significant similarities to known sequences in genbank non-redundant  protein database.  <dig>  unigenes were found to be differentially expressed between ros-treated and un-treated rudimentary leaves, and genes encoding signaling components of plant hormones such as aba and ethylene were significantly enriched.


CONCLUSIONS
our transcriptome data represents the comprehensive collection of expressed sequence tags  of litchi leaves, which is a vital resource for future studies on the genomics of litchi and other closely related species. the identified differentially expressed genes also provided potential candidates for functional analysis of genes involved in litchi flowering underlying the control of rudimentary leaves in the panicles.
