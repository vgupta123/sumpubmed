BACKGROUND
catecholamines, such as epinephrine, are elaborated in stress responses, and mediate vasoconstriction to cause elevation in systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. our previous study has shown that il- <dig> can induce mast cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines which are involved in atherogenesis. the aim of this study was to determine the effects of epinephrine on il-1-induced proatherogenic cytokine production from mast cells.


RESULTS
two ml of hmc- <dig>  were cultured with epinephrine  in the presence or absence of il-1β  for  <dig> hrs. hmc- <dig> cultured alone produced none to trace amounts of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  il-1β significantly induced production of these cytokines in hmc- <dig>  while epinephrine alone did not. however, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> production induced by il-1β were significantly enhanced by addition of epinephrine. the enhancing effect appears to involve nf-κb and p <dig> mapk pathways. flow cytometry showed the presence of β <dig> and β <dig> adrenoreceptors on resting mast cells. the enhancing effect of proatherogenic cytokine production by epinephrine was down regulated by the β <dig> and β <dig> adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, but not by the β <dig> adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol, suggesting the effect involved β <dig> adrenoceptors. the enhancing effect of epinephrine on proatherogenic cytokine production was also down regulated by the immunosuppressive drug, dexamethasone.


CONCLUSIONS
these results not only confirm that an acute phase cytokine, il-1β, regulates mast cell function, but also show that epinephrine up regulates the il-1β induction of proatherogenic cytokines in mast cells. these data provide a novel role for epinephrine, a stress hormone, in inflammation and atherogenesis.
