BACKGROUND
alternatively activated macrophages  play important roles in allergies and responses to parasitic infections. however, whether signaling through toll-like receptors  plays any role in aamϕ induction when young fasciola hepatica penetrates the liver capsule and migrates through the liver tissue is still unclear.


RESULTS
the data show that the lack of myeloid differentiation factor  <dig>  has no effect on the aamϕ derived from the bone marrow  in vitro and does not impair the mrna expression of arginase- <dig>  resistin-like molecule , and ym <dig> in bmmϕs. the th <dig> cytokine production bias in splenocytes was not significantly altered in f. hepatica-infected mice in the absence of myd <dig> in vitro and in the pleural cavity lavage in vivo. in addition, myd88-deficiency has no effect on the arginase production of the f. hepatica elicited macrophages , production of relmα and ym <dig> proteins and mrna expression of ym <dig> and relmα of macrophages in the peritoneal cavity  <dig> weeks post f. hepatica infection.


CONCLUSIONS
the absence of myd <dig> has no effect on presence of aamϕ  <dig> weeks post f. hepatica infection.
