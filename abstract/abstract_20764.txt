BACKGROUND
the lundehund is a highly specialized breed characterized by a unique flexibility of the joints and polydactyly in all four limbs. the extremely small population size and high inbreeding has promoted a high frequency of diseased dogs affected by the lundehund syndrome , a severe gastro-enteropathic disease.


RESULTS
comprehensive analysis of bead chip and whole-genome sequencing data for ls in the lundehund resulted in a genome-wide association signal on cfa  <dig> and ls-specific runs of homozygosity  in this region. filtering analysis for variants with predicted high or moderate effects revealed a missense mutation in leprel <dig>  <dig>  mb proximal to the region of the genome-wide association, which was shown to be significantly associated with ls. ls-affected lundehund harbored the mutant leprel1:g.139212c>g genotype a/a whereas all controls of other breeds showed the c/c wild type.

in addition, roh analysis for the lundehund indicated a high enrichment of genes in potential signatures of selection affecting protein activation and immunoregulatory processes like nod <dig> potentially involved in ls breed disposition.


CONCLUSIONS
sequencing results for lundehund specific traits reveal a potential causative mutation for ls in the neuropeptide operating gene leprel <dig> and suggests it as a precursor of the inflammatory process. analyses of roh regions give an insight into the genetic background of characteristic traits in the lundehund that remain to be elucidated in the future.
