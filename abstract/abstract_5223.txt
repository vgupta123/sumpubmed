BACKGROUND
plasmids are an important component of the bacterial genome, but the crosstalk between genes encoded on the chromosome and on the plasmid is still poorly understood.


RESULTS
we performed a large-scale survey for genes on the e. coli chromosome that are affected by the presence of the conjugative f-plasmid . the expression pattern of about 4%  of the genes encoded by the chromosome was affected by the presence of the f-plasmid. comparing two different escherichia coli strains, mg <dig> and dh5Î±, we found a strong host genotype-specific crosstalk of the host chromosome with the f-plasmid. about 88% of the genes affected by the presence of the f-plasmid showed a significant plasmid by host genotype interaction, i.e. the presence of the f-plasmid resulted in a different gene expression in the two host genotypes. less than 12% of the genes showed an additive effect of gene expression, i.e. host genotype independent crosstalk between plasmid and host chromosome.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that epistatic effects also contribute to the maintenance of f-plasmids in natural populations.
