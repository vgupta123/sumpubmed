BACKGROUND
retrotransposons make a significant contribution to the size, organization and genetic diversity of their host genomes. to characterize retrotransposon families in the grapevine genome  we have combined two approaches: a pcr-based method for the isolation of rnaseh-ltr sequences with a computer-based sequence similarity search in the whole-genome sequence of pn <dig> 


RESULTS
supported by a phylogenic analysis, ten novel ty1/copia families were distinguished in this study. to select a canonical reference element sequence from amongst the various insertions in the genome belonging to each retroelement family, the following screening criteria were adopted to identify the element sequence with:  perfect  <dig> bp-duplication of target sites,  the highest level of identity between 5' and 3'-ltr within a single insertion sequence, and  longest, un-interrupted coding capacity within the gag-pol orf. one to eight copies encoding a single putatively functional gag-pol polyprotein were found for three families, indicating that these families could be still autonomous and active. for the others, no autonomous copies were identified. however, a subset of copies within the presumably non-autonomous families had perfect identity between their 5' and 3' ltrs, indicating a recent insertion event. a phylogenic study based on the sequence alignment of the region located between reverse transcriptase domains i and vii distinguished these  <dig> families from other plant retrotransposons. including the previously characterized ty1/copia-like grapevine retrotransposons tvv <dig> and vine  <dig> and the ty3/gypsy-like gret <dig> in this assessment, a total of  <dig> copies were identified for the  <dig> retrotransposon families, representing  <dig> % of the sequenced genome. the copy number per family ranged from 91â€“ <dig> copies. we performed insertion site profiling for  <dig> out of the  <dig> retrotransposon families and confirmed multiple insertions of these elements across the vitis genus. insertional polymorphism analysis and dating of full-length copies based on their ltr divergence demonstrated that each family has a particular amplification history, with 71% of the identified copies being inserted within the last  <dig> million years.


CONCLUSIONS
the strategy we used efficiently delivered new ty1/copia-like retrotransposon sequences, increasing the total number of characterized grapevine retrotrotransposons from  <dig> to  <dig>  we provide insights into the representation and dynamics of the  <dig> families in the genome. our data demonstrated that each family has a particular amplification pattern, with  <dig> families having copies recently inserted within the last  <dig>  million year. among those  <dig> families with recent insertions, three retain the capacity for activity in the grape genome today.
