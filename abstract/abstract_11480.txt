BACKGROUND
the ff domain is conserved across all eukaryotes and usually acts as an adaptor module in rna metabolism and transcription. saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes two ff domain proteins, prp <dig>  a component of the u <dig> snrnp, and ypr152c, a protein of unknown function. the structure of prp <dig>  its relationship to other proteins within the u <dig> snrnp, and its precise function remain little understood.


RESULTS
here we have investigated the essentiality and interaction properties of the ff domains of yeast prp <dig>  we show that the c-terminal two ff domains of prp <dig> are dispensable. deletion of additional ff domains is lethal. the first ff domain of prp <dig> binds to u <dig> protein luc <dig> in yeast two-hybrid and gst pulldown experiments. ff domains  <dig> and  <dig> bind to snu <dig>  another known u <dig> protein. peptide array screens identified binding sites for ff1- <dig> within snu <dig>  and for ff <dig> within luc <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
prp <dig>  luc <dig>  and snu <dig> appear to form a subcomplex within the yeast u1snrnp. our data suggests that the n-terminal ff domains are critical for these interactions. crystallization of prp <dig>  luc <dig>  and snu <dig> have failed so far but co-crystallization of pairs or the whole tri-complex may facilitate crystallographic and further functional analysis.
