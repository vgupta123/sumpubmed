BACKGROUND
sucrose is the primary photosynthesis product and the principal translocating form within higher plants. sucrose transporters  play a critical role in phloem loading and unloading. photoassimilate transport is a major limiting factor for seed yield. our previous research demonstrated that sut co-localizes with yield-related quantitative trait loci. this paper reports the isolation of bna <dig> sut <dig> alleles and their promoters and their association with yield-related traits.


RESULTS
two novel bna <dig> sut <dig> genes were isolated from b. napus lines 'eagle' and 's-1300' and designated as bna <dig> sut <dig> a and bna <dig> sut <dig> b, respectively. the bna <dig> sut <dig> protein exhibited typical sut features and showed high amino acid homology with related species. promoters of bna <dig> sut <dig> a and bna <dig> sut <dig> b were also isolated and classified as pbna <dig> sut <dig> a and pbna <dig> sut <dig> b, respectively. four dominant sequence-characterized amplified region markers were developed to distinguish bna <dig> sut <dig> a and bna <dig> sut <dig> b. the two genes were estimated as alleles with two segregating populations  obtained by crossing '3715'Ã—'3769'. bna <dig> sut <dig> was mapped to the a <dig> linkage group of the tn doubled haploid population. in silico analysis of  <dig> segmental bna <dig> sut <dig> alleles resulted three bna <dig> sut <dig> clusters: pbna <dig> sut <dig> a- bna <dig> sut <dig> a , pbna <dig> sut <dig> b- bna <dig> sut <dig> a , and pbna <dig> sut <dig> b- bna <dig> sut <dig> b . association analysis with a diverse panel of  <dig> rapeseed lines identified single nucleotide polymorphisms  in promoter and coding domain sequences of bna <dig> sut <dig> that were significantly associated with one of three yield-related traits: number of effective first branches , siliques per plant , and seed weight   across all four environments examined. snps at other bna <dig> sut <dig> sites were also significantly associated with at least one of six yield-related traits: efb, sp, number of seeds per silique, seed yield per plant, block yield, and tsw. expression levels varied over various tissue/organs at the seed-filling stage, and bna <dig> sut <dig> expression positively correlated with efb and tsw.


CONCLUSIONS
sequence, mapping, association, and expression analyses collectively showed significant diversity between the two bna <dig> sut <dig> alleles, which control some of the phenotypic variation for branch number and seed weight in b. napus consistent with expression levels. the associations between allelic variation and yield-related traits may facilitate selection of better genotypes in breeding.
