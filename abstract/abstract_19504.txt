BACKGROUND
this study is to explore the key genes and signaling transduction pathways related to the survival time of glioblastoma multiforme  patients.


RESULTS
our results not only showed that mutually explored gbm survival time related genes and signaling transduction pathways are closely related to the gbm, but also demonstrated that our innovated constrained optimization algorithm  are better than the classical methods .


CONCLUSIONS
we analyzed why the coxsislasso strategy can outperform the existing classical methods and discuss how to extend this research in the distant future.
