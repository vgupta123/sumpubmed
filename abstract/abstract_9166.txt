BACKGROUND
separation from mechanical ventilation is a difficult task, whereas conventional predictive indices have not been proven accurate enough, so far. a few studies have explored changes of breathing pattern variability for weaning outcome prediction, with conflicting results. in this study, we tried to assess respiratory complexity during weaning trials, using different non-linear methods derived from theory of complex systems, in a cohort of surgical critically ill patients.


RESULTS
thirty two patients were enrolled in the study. there were  <dig> who passed and  <dig> who failed a weaning trial. tidal volume and mean inspiratory flow were analyzed for  <dig> minutes during two phases:  <dig>  pressure support  ventilation  and  <dig>  weaning trials with ps:  <dig> cm h2o. sample entropy , detrended fluctuation analysis  exponent, fractal dimension  and largest lyapunov exponents  of the two respiratory parameters were computed in all patients and during the two phases of ps. weaning failure patients exhibited significantly decreased respiratory pattern complexity, reflected in reduced sample entropy and lyapunov exponents and increased dfa exponents of respiratory flow time series, compared to weaning success subjects . in addition, their changes were opposite between the two phases of the weaning trials. a new model including rapid shallow breathing index , its product with airway occlusion pressure at  <dig>  sec , sampen and lle predicted better weaning outcome compared with rsbi, p <dig>  and rsbi* p <dig>  . areas under the curve were  <dig>  vs  <dig> , respectively .


CONCLUSIONS
we suggest that complexity analysis of respiratory signals can assess inherent breathing pattern dynamics and has increased prognostic impact upon weaning outcome in surgical patients.
