BACKGROUND
one-dimensional protein structures such as secondary structures or contact numbers are useful for three-dimensional structure prediction and helpful for intuitive understanding of the sequence-structure relationship. accurate prediction methods will serve as a basis for these and other purposes.


RESULTS
we implemented a program crnpred which predicts secondary structures, contact numbers and residue-wise contact orders. this program is based on a novel machine learning scheme called critical random networks. unlike most conventional one-dimensional structure prediction methods which are based on local windows of an amino acid sequence, crnpred takes into account the whole sequence. crnpred achieves, on average per chain, q <dig> = 81% for secondary structure prediction, and correlation coefficients of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for contact number and residue-wise contact order predictions, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
crnpred will be a useful tool for computational as well as experimental biologists who need accurate one-dimensional protein structure predictions.
