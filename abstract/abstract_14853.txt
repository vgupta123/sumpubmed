BACKGROUND
low fertility remains a leading cause of poor productivity in dairy cattle. in this context, there is significant interest in developing novel tools for accurate early diagnosis of pregnancy. micrornas  are short rna molecules which are critically involved in regulating gene expression during both health and disease. mirnas have been shown to regulate ovarian function, uterine receptivity, embryonic development and placental function. circulating mirnas can provide useful biomarkers of tissue function and disease; importantly, differential mirna profiles have been linked to pregnancy and preeclampsia in humans. this study sought to establish the potential of circulating mirnas as biomarkers of early pregnancy in cattle.


RESULTS
we applied illumina small-rna sequencing to profile mirnas in plasma samples collected from eight non-pregnant heifers on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the oestrous cycle and  <dig> heifers on days  <dig> and  <dig> of pregnancy. we sequenced a total of  <dig> samples and generated  <dig>  million mirna reads per sample. there were no differences in mirna read abundance between any of the pregnant and non-pregnant time-points . as a complementary approach, we analysed sample pools  corresponding to days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the oestrous cycle and day  <dig> of pregnancy  using qiagen pcr arrays. a total of  <dig> mirnas were differentially expressed  in plasma between pregnant and non-pregnant animals. rt-qpcr validation using the same plasma samples confirmed that mir-26a was differentially upregulated on day  <dig> pregnant relative to non-pregnant heifers , whereas mir- <dig> tended to be upregulated in day  <dig> pregnant heifers . further validation in an independent group of heifers confirmed an increase in plasma mir-26a levels during early pregnancy, which was significant only on day  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
through genome-wide analyses we have successfully profiled plasma mirna populations associated with early pregnancy in cattle. we have identified mir-26a as a potential circulating biomarker of early pregnancy.
