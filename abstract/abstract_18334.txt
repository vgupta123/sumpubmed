BACKGROUND
an early dispersal of biologically and behaviorally modern humans from their african origins to australia, by at least  <dig> thousand years via southern asia has been suggested by studies based on morphology, archaeology and genetics. however, mtdna lineages sampled so far from south asia, eastern asia and australasia show non-overlapping distributions of haplogroups within pan eurasian m and n macrohaplogroups. likewise, support from the archaeology is still ambiguous.


RESULTS
in our completely sequenced 966-mitochondrial genomes from  <dig> relic tribes of india, we have identified seven genomes, which share two synonymous polymorphisms with the m <dig> haplogroup, which is specific to australian aborigines.


CONCLUSIONS
our results showing a shared mtdna lineage between indians and australian aborigines provides direct genetic evidence of an early colonization of australia through south asia, following the "southern route".
