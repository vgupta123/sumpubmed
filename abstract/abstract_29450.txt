BACKGROUND
the dengue virus is the most significant arthropod-borne human pathogen, and an increasing number of cases have been reported over the last few decades. currently neither vaccines nor drugs against the dengue virus are available. ns <dig> methyltransferase , which is located on the surface of the dengue virus and assists in viral attachment to the host cell, is a promising antiviral target. in order to search for novel inhibitors of ns <dig> mtase, we performed a computer-aided virtual screening of more than  <dig> million commercially available chemical compounds using two approaches: i) structure-based screening using the crystal structure of ns <dig> mtase and ii) ligand-based screening using active ligands of ns <dig> mtase. structure-based screening was performed using the lidaeus  program. the ligand-based screening was carried out using the eduliss  program.


RESULTS
the selection of potential inhibitors of dengue ns <dig> mtase was based on two criteria: the compounds must bind to ns <dig> mtase with a higher affinity than that of active ns <dig> mtase ligands, such as ribavirin triphosphate  and s-adenosyl-l-homocysteine ; and the compounds must interact with residues that are catalytically important for the function of ns <dig> mtase. we found several compounds that bind strongly to the rna cap site and the s-adenosyl-l-methionine  binding site of ns <dig> mtase with better binding affinities than that of rtp and sah. we analyzed the mode of binding for each compound to its binding site, and our results suggest that all compounds bind to their respective binding sites by interacting with, and thus blocking, residues that are vital for maintaining the catalytic activity of ns <dig> mtase.


CONCLUSIONS
we discovered several potential compounds that are active against dengue virus ns <dig> mtase through virtual screening using structure-based and ligand-based methods. these compounds were predicted to bind into the sam binding site and the rna cap site with higher affinities than sah and rtp. these compounds are commercially available and can be purchased for further biological activity tests.
