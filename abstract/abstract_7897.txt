BACKGROUND
secaloindoline a  and secaloindoline b  genes of hexaploid triticale  are orthologs of puroindoline a  and puroindoline b  in hexaploid wheat . it has already been proven that rna interference -based silencing of pina and pinb genes significantly decreased the puroindoline a and puroindoline b proteins in wheat and essentially increased grain hardness . the function of sina and sinb in triticale was tested by means of rnai silencing and compared to wheat.


RESULTS
novel sina and sinb alleles in wild-type plants of cv. wanad were identified and their expression profiles characterized. alignment with wheat pina-d1a and pinb-d1a alleles showed 95% and  <dig> % homology with sina and sinb coding sequences. twenty transgenic lines transformed with two hprna silencing cassettes directed to silence sina or sinb were obtained by the agrobacterium-mediated method. a significant decrease of expression of both sin genes in segregating progeny of tested t <dig> lines was observed independent of the silencing cassette used. the silencing was transmitted to the t <dig> kernel generation. the relative transcript level was reduced by up to 99% in t <dig> progeny with the mean for the sublines being around 90%. silencing of the sin genes resulted in a substantial decrease of secaloindoline a and secaloindoline b content. the identity of sin peptides was confirmed by mass spectrometry. the hardness index, measured by the skcs  method, ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> in silent lines and from  <dig> to  <dig> in the control, and the mean values were insignificantly lower in the silent ones, proving increased softness. additionally, the mean total seed protein content of silenced lines was about 6% lower compared with control lines. correlation coefficients between hardness and transcript level were weakly positive.


CONCLUSIONS
we documented that rnai-based silencing of sin genes resulted in significant decrease of their transcripts and the level of both secaloindoline proteins, however did not affect grain hardness. the unexpected, functional differences of sin genes from triticale compared with their orthologs, pin of wheat, are discussed.
