BACKGROUND
using near-infrared spectroscopy , our previous neural adaptation studies found that infants’ bilateral temporal regions process facial identity . in addition, we revealed that size-invariant processing of facial identity develops by 5 months of age , while view-invariant processing develops around 7 months of age . the aim in the current study was to examine whether infants’ brains process facial identity across the non-rigid transformation of facial features by using the neural adaptation paradigm. we used nirs to compare hemodynamic changes in the bilateral temporal areas of 5- to 6-month-olds and 7- to 8-month-olds during presentations of an identical face and of different faces.


RESULTS
we found that  the oxyhemoglobin concentration around the t <dig> and t <dig> positions increased significantly during the presentation of different faces only in 7- to 8-month-olds and  7- to 8-month-olds, but not 5- to 6-month-olds, showed attenuation in these channels to the presentation of the same face rather than to the presentation of different faces, regardless of non-rigid changes in facial features.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that the processing of facial identity with non-rigid facial transformation develops around 7 months after birth.
