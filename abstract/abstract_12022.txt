BACKGROUND
mitochondrial  genomes represent a rich source of molecular markers for a range of applications, including population genetics, systematics, epidemiology and ecology. in the present study, we used  <dig> technology  to determine the complete mt genome of haemonchus contortus , a parasite of substantial agricultural, veterinary and economic significance. we validate this approach by comparison with mt sequences from publicly available expressed sequence tag  and genomic survey sequence  data sets.


RESULTS
the complete mt genome of haemonchus contortus was sequenced directly from long-pcr amplified template utilizing genomic dna  from a single adult male using  <dig> technology. a single contig was assembled and compared against mt sequences mined from publicly available est  and gss datasets. the comparison demonstrated that the  <dig> technology platform is reliable for the sequencing of at-rich mt genomes from nematodes. the mt genome sequenced for haemonchus contortus was  <dig>  bp in length and was highly at-rich . in accordance with other chromadorean nematodes studied to date, the mt genome of h. contortus contained  <dig> genes  and was similar in structure, size and gene arrangement to those characterized previously for members of the strongylida.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrates the utility of  <dig> technology for the rapid determination of mt genome sequences from tiny amounts of dna and reveals a wealth of mt genomic data in current databases available for mining. this approach provides a novel platform for high-throughput sequencing of mt genomes from nematodes and other organisms.
