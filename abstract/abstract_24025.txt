BACKGROUND
in prokaryotes, the ureases are multi-subunit, nickel-containing enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia. the brucella genomes contain two urease operons designated as ure <dig> and ure <dig>  we investigated the role of the two brucella suis urease operons on the infection, intracellular persistence, growth, and resistance to low-ph killing.


RESULTS
the deduced amino acid sequence of urease-α subunits of operons- <dig> and - <dig> exhibited substantial identity with the structural ureases of alpha- and beta-proteobacteria, gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and higher plants. four ure deficient strains were generated by deleting one or more of the genes encoding urease subunits of b. suis strain  <dig> by allelic exchange: strain 1330Δure1k , strain 1330Δure2k , strain 1330Δure2c , and strain 1330Δure1kΔure2c . when grown in urease test broth, strains  <dig>  1330Δure2k and 1330Δure2c displayed maximal urease enzyme activity within  <dig> hours, whereas, strains 1330Δure1k and 1330Δure1kΔure2c exhibited zero urease activity even  <dig> h after inoculation. strains 1330Δure1k and 1330Δure1kΔure2c exhibited slower growth rates in tryptic soy broth relative to the wild type strain  <dig>  when the balb/c mice were infected intraperitoneally with the strains, six weeks after inoculation, the splenic recovery of the ure deficient strains did not differ from the wild type. in contrast, when the mice were inoculated by gavage, one week after inoculation, strain 1330Δure1kΔure2c was cleared from livers and spleens while the wild type strain  <dig> was still present. all b. suis strains were killed when they were incubated in-vitro at ph  <dig> . when the strains were incubated at ph  <dig>  supplemented with  <dig> mm urea, strain 1330Δure1k was completely killed, strain 1330Δure2c was partially killed, but strains  <dig> and 1330Δure2k were not killed.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that the ure <dig> operon is necessary for optimal growth in culture, urease activity, resistance against low-ph killing, and in vivo persistence of b. suis when inoculated by gavage. the ure <dig> operon apparently enhances the resistance to low-ph killing in-vitro.
