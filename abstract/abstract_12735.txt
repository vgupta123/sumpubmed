BACKGROUND
detecting genetic variation is a critical step in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic diversity. until recently, such detection has mostly focused on single nucleotide polymorphisms  because of the ease in screening complete genomes. another type of variant, copy number variation , is emerging as a significant contributor to phenotypic variation in many species. here we describe a genome-wide cnv study using array comparative genomic hybridization  in a wide variety of chicken breeds.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig>  cnvs, grouped into  <dig>  cnv regions . thirty percent of the cnvs were detected in at least  <dig> individuals. the average size of the cnvs detected was  <dig>  kb with the largest cnv, located on ggaz, being  <dig>  mb. approximately 75% of the cnvs are copy number losses relatively to the red jungle fowl reference genome. the genome coverage of cnvrs in this study is  <dig> mb, which represents almost  <dig> % of the chicken genome. in particular large gene families such as the keratin gene family and the mhc show extensive cnv.


CONCLUSIONS
a relative large group of the cnvs are line-specific, several of which were previously shown to be related to the causative mutation for a number of phenotypic variants. the chance that inter-specific cnvs fall into cnvrs detected in chicken is related to the evolutionary distance between the species. our results provide a valuable resource for the study of genetic and phenotypic variation in this phenotypically diverse species.
