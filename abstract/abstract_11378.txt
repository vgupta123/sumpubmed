BACKGROUND
anabolic steroids, such as nandrolone, slow muscle atrophy, but the mechanisms responsible for this effect are largely unknown. their effects on muscle size and gene expression depend upon time, and the cause of muscle atrophy. administration of nandrolone for  <dig> days beginning either concomitantly with sciatic nerve transection  or  <dig> days later  attenuated denervation atrophy at  <dig> but not  <dig> days. we reasoned that this model could be used to identify genes that are regulated by nandrolone and slow denervation atrophy, as well as genes that might explain the time-dependence of nandrolone effects on such atrophy. affymetrix microarrays were used to profile gene expression changes due to nandrolone at  <dig> and  <dig> days and to identify major gene expression changes in denervated muscle between  <dig> and  <dig> days.


RESULTS
nandrolone selectively altered expression of  <dig> genes at  <dig> days and  <dig> genes at  <dig> days, with only  <dig> genes being regulated at both time points. marked differences in biological function of genes regulated by nandrolone at  <dig> and  <dig> days were observed. at  <dig>  but not  <dig> days, nandrolone reduced mrna and protein levels for foxo <dig>  the mtor inhibitor redd <dig>  and the calcineurin inhibitor rcan <dig> and increased those for apod. at  <dig> days, correlations between mrna levels and the size of denervated muscle were negative for rcan <dig>  and positive for apod. nandrolone also regulated genes for wnt signaling molecules. comparison of gene expression at  <dig> and  <dig> days after denervation revealed marked alterations in the expression of  <dig> transcriptional coregulators, including ankrd <dig> and  <dig>  and many transcription factors and kinases.


CONCLUSIONS
genes regulated in denervated muscle after  <dig> days administration of nandrolone are almost entirely different at  <dig> versus  <dig> days. alterations in levels of foxo <dig>  and of genes involved in signaling through calcineurin, mtor and wnt may be linked to the favorable action of nandrolone on denervated muscle. marked changes in the expression of genes regulating transcription and intracellular signaling may contribute to the time-dependent effects of nandrolone on gene expression.
