BACKGROUND
the recent h1n <dig> influenza pandemic illustrated the shortcomings of the vaccine manufacturing process. the a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> pandemic influenza vaccine or apdm <dig> was available late and in short supply as a result of delays in production caused by low yields and poor antigen stability. recombinant technology offers the opportunity to shorten manufacturing time. a trivalent recombinant hemagglutinin  vaccine candidate for seasonal influenza produced using the baculovirus expression vector system  was shown to be as effective and safe as egg-derived trivalent inactivated vaccine  in human clinical studies. in this study, we describe the characterization of the a/california/07/ <dig> rha protein and compare the h1n <dig> pandemic rha to other seasonal rha proteins.


RESULTS
our data show that, like other rha proteins, purified a/california/07/ <dig> rha forms multimeric rosette-like particles of 20–40 nm that are biologically active and immunogenic in mice as assayed by hemagglutination inhibition  antibody titers. however, proteolytic digest analysis revealed that a/california/07/ <dig> rha is more susceptible to proteolytic degradation than rha proteins derived from other seasonal influenza viruses. we identified a specific proteolytic site conserved across multiple hemagglutinin  proteins that is likely more accessible in a/california/07/ <dig> ha, possibly as a result of differences in its protein structure, and may contribute to lower antigen stability.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that, similar to the recombinant seasonal influenza vaccine, recombinant apdm <dig> vaccine is likely to perform comparably to licensed apdm <dig> vaccines and could offer manufacturing advantages.
