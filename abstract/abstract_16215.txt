BACKGROUND
thyroid receptors, trα and trβ, are involved in important physiological functions such as metabolism, cholesterol level and heart activities. whereas metabolism increase and cholesterol level lowering could be achieved by trβ isoform activation, trα activation affects heart rates. therefore, β-selective thyromimetics have been developed as promising drug-candidates for treatment of obesity and elevated cholesterol level. gc- <dig>  has ability to lower ldl cholesterol with 600- to 1400-fold more potency and approximately two- to threefold more efficacy than atorvastatin  in studies in rats, mice and monkeys.


RESULTS
to investigate gc- <dig> specificity, we solved crystal structures and performed molecular dynamics simulations of both isoforms complexed with gc- <dig>  crystal structures reveal that, in trα arg <dig> is observed in multiple conformations, an effect triggered by the differences in the interactions between gc- <dig> and ser <dig> or the corresponding asparagine  of trβ. the corresponding arg <dig> of trβ is observed in only one single stable conformation, interacting effectively with the ligand. molecular dynamics support this model: our simulations show that the multiple conformations can be observed for the arg <dig> in trα, in which the ligand interacts either strongly with the ligand or with the ser <dig> residue. in contrast, a single stable arg <dig> conformation is observed for trβ, in which it strongly interacts with both gc- <dig> and the asn <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis suggests that the key factors for gc- <dig> selectivity are the presence of an oxyacetic acid ester oxygen and the absence of the amino group relative to t <dig>  these results shed light into the β-selectivity of gc- <dig> and may assist the development of new compounds with potential as drug candidates to the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and obesity.
