BACKGROUND
altered gene expression is an important feature of ischemic cerebral injury and affects proteins of many functional classes. we have used microarrays to investigate the changes in gene expression at various times after middle cerebral artery occlusion in human and rat brain.


RESULTS
our results demonstrated a significant difference in the number of genes affected and the time-course of expression between the two cases. the total number of deregulated genes in the rat was  <dig> versus  <dig> in the human, while, of  <dig> overlapping genes between the two array sets,  <dig> were changed only in the rat and  <dig> in the human with a total of  <dig> genes deregulated in both cases. interestingly, the mean fold changes were much higher in the human. the expression of novel genes, including p21-activated kinase  <dig> , matrix metalloproteinase  <dig>  and integrase interactor  <dig>  was further analyzed by rt-pcr, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. strong neuronal staining was seen for pak <dig> and mmp <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our findings confirmed previous studies reporting that gene expression screening can detect known and unknown transcriptional features of stroke and highlight the importance of research using human brain tissue in the search for novel therapeutic agents.
