BACKGROUND
the great variety in sequence, length, complexity, and abundance of satellite dna has made it difficult to ascribe any function to this genome component. recent studies have shown that satellite dna can be transcribed and be involved in regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. some satellite dnas, such as the pdo <dig> sequence family in dolichopoda cave crickets, have a catalytic hammerhead  ribozyme structure and activity embedded within each repeat.


RESULTS
we assessed the phylogenetic footprints of the hh ribozyme within the pdo <dig> sequences from  <dig> different populations representing  <dig> species of dolichopoda. the hh region was significantly more conserved than the non-hammerhead  region of the pdo <dig> repeat. in addition, stems were more conserved than loops. in stems, several compensatory mutations were detected that maintain base pairing. the core region of the hh ribozyme was affected by very few nucleotide substitutions and the cleavage position was altered only once among  <dig> sequences. rna folding of the hh sequences revealed that a potentially active hh ribozyme can be found in most of the dolichopoda populations and species.


CONCLUSIONS
the phylogenetic footprints suggest that the hh region of the pdo <dig> sequence family is selected for function in dolichopoda cave crickets. however, the functional role of hh ribozymes in eukaryotic organisms is unclear. the possible functions have been related to trans cleavage of an rna target by a ribonucleoprotein and regulation of gene expression. whether the hh ribozyme in dolichopoda is involved in similar functions remains to be investigated. future studies need to demonstrate how the observed nucleotide changes and evolutionary constraint have affected the catalytic efficiency of the hammerhead.
