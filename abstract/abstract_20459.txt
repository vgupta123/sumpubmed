BACKGROUND
the trophoblast compartment of the placenta comprises various subpopulations with distinct functions. they interact among each other by secreted signals thus forming autocrine or paracrine regulatory loops. we established a first trimester trophoblast cell line  by fusion of primary human first trimester trophoblasts  with a human choriocarcinoma cell line .


RESULTS
expression of trophoblast markers , invasion abilities and transcriptome of ach-3p closely resembled primary trophoblasts. morphology, cytogenetics and doubling time was similar to the parental ac1- <dig> cells. the different subpopulations of trophoblasts e.g., villous and extravillous trophoblasts also exist in ach-3p cells and can be immuno-separated by hla-g surface expression. hla-g positive ach-3p display pseudopodia and a stronger expression of extravillous trophoblast markers. higher expression of insulin-like growth factor ii receptor and human chorionic gonadotropin represents the basis for the known autocrine stimulation of extravillous trophoblasts.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that ach-3p represent a tool to investigate interaction of syngeneic trophoblast subpopulations. these cells are particularly suited for studies into autocrine and paracrine regulation of various aspects of trophoblast function. as an example a novel effect of tnf-Î± on matrix metalloproteinase  <dig> in hla-g positive ach-3p and explants was found.
