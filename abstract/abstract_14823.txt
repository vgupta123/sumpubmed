BACKGROUND
novosphingobium sp. strain pp1y is a marine α-proteobacterium adapted to grow at the water/fuel oil interface. it exploits the aromatic fraction of fuel oils as a carbon and energy source. pp1y is able to grow on a wide range of mono-, poly- and heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. here, we report the complete functional annotation of the whole novosphingobium genome.


RESULTS
pp1y genome analysis and its comparison with other sphingomonadal genomes has yielded novel insights into the molecular basis of pp1y’s phenotypic traits, such as its peculiar ability to encapsulate and degrade the aromatic fraction of fuel oils. in particular, we have identified and dissected several highly specialized metabolic pathways involved in:  aromatic hydrocarbon degradation;  resistance to toxic compounds; and  the quorum sensing mechanism.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the unraveling of the entire pp1y genome sequence has provided important insight into pp1y metabolism and, most importantly, has opened new perspectives about the possibility of its manipulation for bioremediation purposes.
