BACKGROUND
senescence-accelerated mice  are a series of mouse strains originally derived from unexpected crosses between akr/j and unknown mice, from which phenotypically distinct senescence-prone  and -resistant  inbred strains were subsequently established. although samp strains have been widely used for aging research focusing on their short life spans and various age-related phenotypes, such as immune dysfunction, osteoporosis, and brain atrophy, the responsible gene mutations have not yet been fully elucidated.


RESULTS
to identify mutations specific to samp strains, we performed whole exome sequencing of  <dig> samp and  <dig> samr strains. this analysis revealed  <dig>  to  <dig>  single-nucleotide variants in the coding region of each sam strain. we detected ogg <dig> p.r304w and mbd <dig> p.d129n deleterious mutations in all  <dig> of the samp strains but not in the samr or akr/j strains. moreover, we extracted  <dig> samp-specific novel deleterious mutations. in all samp strains except samp <dig>  we detected a p.r473w missense mutation in the ldb <dig> gene, which has been associated with myofibrillar myopathy. in  <dig> samp strains , we identified a p.r167c missense mutation in the prx gene, in which mutations causing hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy  have been identified. in samp <dig> we detected a p.s540fs frame-shift mutation in the il4ra gene, a mutation potentially causative of ulcerative colitis and osteoporosis.


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that different combinations of mutations in disease-causing genes may be responsible for the various phenotypes of samp strains.
