BACKGROUND
"type ii"/receptor cells express g protein-coupled receptors  for sweet, umami  or bitter , as well as the proteins for downstream signalling cascades. transduction downstream of t1rs and t2rs relies on g-protein and plcβ2-mediated release of stored ca2+. whereas gαgus  couples to the t2r  receptors, which gα-subunit couples to the sweet  receptor is presently not known. we utilized rt-pcr, immunocytochemistry and single-cell gene expression profiling to examine the expression of the gαq family  in mouse taste buds.


RESULTS
by rt-pcr, gα <dig> is expressed strongly and in a taste selective manner in posterior , but not anterior  taste fields. gαq and gα <dig>  although detectable, are not expressed in a taste-selective fashion. further, expression of gα <dig> mrna is limited to type ii/receptor cells in taste buds. immunocytochemistry on vallate papillae using a broad gαq family antiserum reveals specific staining only in type ii taste cells . this staining persists in gαq knockout mice and immunostaining with a gα11-specific antiserum shows no immunoreactivity in taste buds. taken together, these data show that gα <dig> is the dominant gαq family member detected. immunoreactivity for gα <dig> strongly correlates with expression of t1r <dig>  the taste receptor subunit present in taste cells responsive to either umami or sweet. single cell gene expression profiling confirms a tight correlation between the expression of gα <dig> and both t1r <dig> and t1r <dig>  the receptor combination that forms sweet taste receptors.


CONCLUSIONS
gα <dig> is co-expressed with the sweet taste receptor in posterior tongue, although not in anterior tongue. thus, sweet taste transduction may rely on different downstream transduction elements in posterior and anterior taste fields.
