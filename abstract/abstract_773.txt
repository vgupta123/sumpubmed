BACKGROUND
in insects, hemocyanin superfamily proteins accumulate apparently to serve as sources of amino acids during metamorphosis, reproduction and development. storage hexamerins are important members of the hemocyanin superfamily. although insects possess storage hexamerins, very little is known about the character and specific functions of hexamerin  <dig> and storage protein  <dig> in insect development.


RESULTS
to gain insight into the function of storage proteins in insects, cdnas for two storage proteins were cloned from the fat body of spodoptera exigua. s. exigua hexamerin  <dig>  cdna contained an open reading frame of  <dig> nucleotides encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. s. exigua storage protein  <dig>  cdna contained an open reading frame of  <dig> bp encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of ~ <dig>  kda. northern blotting analyses revealed that sehex mrna is expressed in the fat body, cuticle, midgut and malpighian tubules and sesp <dig> in fat body, malpighian tubules and tracheae. sehex and sesp <dig> mrnas were expressed in fat body at different levels from first instar larvae to pupae, with expression was much lower from first instar larvae to first-day fifth instar larvae. sehex transcript expression was high in fat body of wandering larvae  and steadily decreased to the seventh pupal day. sesp <dig> transcript expression was high in fat body of wandering larvae, 2-day-old fifth instar larvae and 2-, 4- and 7-day-old pupae. sehex and sesp <dig> mrnas levels were expressed lower than control on the condition of starvation at  <dig> h. of insects injected with sehex and sesp <dig> dsrna,  <dig> % and  <dig> % survived to  <dig> h after treatment, respectively. this was significantly lower than in the controls groups.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings provide new data on the tissue distribution, expression patterns and the function in starvation of storage proteins. rna interference results revealed that storage protein genes are key in metamorphosis, reproduction and insect development. the results for sehex and sesp <dig> interference reveal that a potential method to control this pest is to disrupt the regulation of storage proteins.
