BACKGROUND
exome sequencing has become a popular method to evaluate undirected mutagenesis experiments in mice. however, the most suitable mouse strain for the biological model may be relatively distant from the standard mouse reference genome. for pinpointing causative variants, a matching reference with gene annotations is essential, but not always readily available.


RESULTS
we present an approach that allows to use murine ensembl annotations on alternative mouse strain assemblies. we resolved enu-induced mutation screening for  <dig> phenotypic mutant lines generated on c3heb/fej background aligning the sequences against the closely related, but not annotated reference of c3h/hej. variants occurring in all strains were filtered out as specific for the c3heb/fej strain but unrelated to mutagenesis. variants occurring exclusively in all individuals of one mutant line and matching the inheritance model were selected as mutagenesis-related. these variants were annotated with gene and exon names lifted over from the standard murine reference mm <dig> to c3h/hej using megablast. for each mutant line, we could restrict the results to exonic variants in between  <dig> and  <dig> genes.


CONCLUSIONS
the presented method of exonic annotation lift-over proved to be a valuable tool in the search for mutagenesis-derived coding genomic variants and the assessment of genotype-phenotype relationships.
