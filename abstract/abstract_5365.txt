BACKGROUND
in plants, nitrate  nutrition gives rise to a natural n isotopic signature , which correlates with the δ15n of the n source. however, little is known about the relationship between the δ15n of the n source and the 14n/15n fractionation in plants under ammonium  nutrition. when nh4+ is the major n source, the two forms, nh4+ and nh <dig>  are present in the nutrient solution. there is a  <dig>  thermodynamic isotope effect between nh <dig>  and nh4+  which drives to a different δ15n. nine plant species with different nh4+-sensitivities were cultured hydroponically with no3- or nh4+ as the sole n sources, and plant growth and δ15n were determined. short-term nh4+/nh <dig> uptake experiments at ph  <dig>  and  <dig>   were carried out in order to support and substantiate our hypothesis. n source fractionation throughout the whole plant was interpreted on the basis of the relative transport of nh4+ and nh <dig> 


RESULTS
several no3--fed plants were consistently enriched in 15n, whereas plants under nh4+ nutrition were depleted of 15n. it was shown that more sensitive plants to nh4+ toxicity were the most depleted in 15n. in parallel, n-deficient pea and spinach plants fed with 15nh4+ showed an increased level of nh <dig> uptake at alkaline ph that was related to the 15n depletion of the plant. tolerant to nh4+ pea plants or sensitive spinach plants showed similar trend on 15n depletion while slight differences in the time kinetics were observed during the initial stages. the use of rbno <dig> as control discarded that the differences observed arise from ph detrimental effects.


CONCLUSIONS
this article proposes that the negative values of δ15n in nh4+-fed plants are originated from nh <dig> uptake by plants. moreover, this depletion of the heavier n isotope is proportional to the nh4+/nh <dig> toxicity in plants species. therefore, we hypothesise that the low affinity transport system for nh4+ may have two components: one that transports n in the molecular form and is associated with fractionation and another that transports n in the ionic form and is not associated with fractionation.
