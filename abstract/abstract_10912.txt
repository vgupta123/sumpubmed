BACKGROUND
the kidney-specific nkcc cotransporter isoform nkcc <dig> is involved in the na+ reabsorption in the thich ascending limb  cells and in the regulation of body fluid volume. in contrast, the isoform nkcc <dig> represents the major pathway for cl- entry in endothelial cells, playing a crucial role in cell volume regulation and vascular tone. importantly, both nkcc isoforms are involved in the regulation of blood pressure and represent important potential drug targets for the treatment of hypertension.


RESULTS
taking advantage of an existing thallium -based kit, we set up a tl+ influx-based fluorescent assay, that can accurately and rapidly measure nkcc transporter activity in adherent epithelial cells using the high-throughput flex station device. we assessed the feasibility of this assay in the renal epithelial llc-pk <dig> cells stably transfected with a previously characterized chimeric nkcc <dig> construct . we demonstrated that the assay is highly reproducible, offers high temporal resolution of nkcc-mediated ion flux profiles and, importantly, being a continuous assay, it offers improved sensitivity over previous endpoint nkcc functional assays.


CONCLUSIONS
so far the screening of nkcc transporters activity has been done by 86rb+ influx assays. indeed, a fluorescence-based high-throughput screening method for testing nkcc inhibitors would be extremely useful in the development and characterization of new anti-hypertensive drugs.
