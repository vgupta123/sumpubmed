BACKGROUND
previously, we identified a major quantitative trait locus  for host response to porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus  infection in high linkage disequilibrium  with snp rs <dig> on sus scrofa chromosome  <dig> .


RESULTS
within this qtl, guanylate binding protein  <dig>  was differentially expressed   in blood from aa versus ab rs <dig> genotyped pigs at  <dig> , and 14 days post prrsv infection. all variants within the gbp <dig> transcript in ld with rs <dig> exhibited allele specific expression  in ab individuals . a transcript re-assembly revealed three alternatively spliced transcripts for gbp <dig>  an intronic snp in gbp <dig>  rs <dig>  introduces a splice acceptor site that inserts five nucleotides into the transcript. individuals homozygous for the unfavorable aa genotype predominantly produced this transcript, with a shifted reading frame and early stop codon that truncates the  <dig> c-terminal amino acids of the protein. rna-seq analysis confirmed this snp was associated with differential splicing by qtl genotype  and this was validated by quantitative capillary electrophoresis . the wild-type transcript was expressed at a higher level in ab versus aa individuals, whereas the five-nucleotide insertion transcript was the dominant form in aa individuals. splicing and ase results are consistent with the observed dominant nature of the favorable qtl allele. the rs <dig> snp was also 100 % concordant with rs <dig> in a validation population that possessed an alternate form of the favorable b qtl haplotype.


CONCLUSIONS
gbp <dig> is known to play a role in inflammasome assembly during immune response. however, the role of gbp <dig> host genetic variation in viral immunity is novel. these findings demonstrate that rs <dig> is a strong candidate causal mutation for the ssc <dig> qtl that controls variation in host response to prrsv.
