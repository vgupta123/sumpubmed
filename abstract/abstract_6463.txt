BACKGROUND
the peanut  is an important oilseed crop in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. however, little about the molecular biology of the peanut is currently known. recently, next-generation sequencing technology, termed rna-seq, has provided a powerful approach for analysing the transcriptome, and for shedding light on the molecular biology of peanut.


RESULTS
in this study, we employed rna-seq to analyse the transcriptomes of the immature seeds of three different peanut varieties with different oil contents. a total of  <dig> - <dig>  million paired-end reads with lengths of  <dig> bp were generated from the three varieties and  <dig>  unigenes were assembled with n <dig> of  <dig> bp. based on sequence similarity search with known proteins, a total of  <dig>  genes were identified. among these unigenes, only  <dig>  unigenes were annotated with  <dig> gene ontology  functional categories. and  <dig>  unigenes mapped to  <dig> pathways by searching against the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway database . in addition,  <dig>  microsatellite markers were developed in the unigene library, and  <dig> pcr primers of ssr loci were used for validation of the amplification and the polymorphism.


CONCLUSIONS
we completed a successful global analysis of the peanut transcriptome using rna-seq, a large number of unigenes were assembled, and almost four thousand ssr primers were developed. these data will facilitate gene discovery and functional genomic studies of the peanut plant. in addition, this study provides insight into the complex transcriptome of the peanut and established a biotechnological platform for future research.
