BACKGROUND
venn diagrams are commonly used to display list comparison. in biology, they are widely used to show the differences between gene lists originating from different differential analyses, for instance. they thus allow the comparison between different experimental conditions or between different methods. however, when the number of input lists exceeds four, the diagram becomes difficult to read. alternative layouts and dynamic display features can improve its use and its readability.


RESULTS
jvenn is a new javascript library. it processes lists and produces venn diagrams. it handles up to six input lists and presents results using classical or edwards-venn layouts. user interactions can be controlled and customized. finally, jvenn can easily be embeded in a web page, allowing to have dynamic venn diagrams.


CONCLUSIONS
jvenn is an open source component for web environments helping scientists to analyze their data. the library package, which comes with full documentation and an example, is freely available at http://bioinfo.genotoul.fr/jvenn.
