BACKGROUND
the availability of diverse second- and third-generation sequencing technologies enables the rapid determination of the sequences of bacterial genomes. however, identifying the sequencing technology most suitable for producing a finished genome with multiple chromosomes remains a challenge. we evaluated the abilities of the following three second-generation sequencers: roche  <dig> gs junior , life technologies ion pgm , and illumina miseq  and a third-generation sequencer, the pacific biosciences rs sequencer , by sequencing and assembling the genome of vibrio parahaemolyticus, which consists of a 5-mb genome comprising two circular chromosomes.


RESULTS
we sequenced the genome of v. parahaemolyticus with gs jr, ion pgm, miseq, and pacbio and performed de novo assembly with several genome assemblers. although gs jr generated the longest mean read length of 418 bp among the second-generation sequencers, the maximum contig length of the best assembly from gs jr was  <dig> kbp, and the number of contigs was  <dig>  single runs of ion pgm and miseq produced data of considerably greater sequencing coverage, 279× and  <dig> ×, respectively. the optimized result for ion pgm contained  <dig> contigs assembled from reads of 77× coverage, and the longest contig was  <dig> kbp in size. those for miseq were  <dig> contigs, 58× coverage, and  <dig> kbp, respectively. these results suggest that higher coverage depth is unnecessary for a better assembly result. we observed that multiple rrna coding regions were fragmented in the assemblies from the second-generation sequencers, whereas pacbio generated two exceptionally long contigs of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> ,537 bps, each of which was from a single chromosome, with 73× coverage and mean read length  <dig>  bp, allowing us to determine the absolute positions of all rrna operons.


CONCLUSIONS
pacbio outperformed the other sequencers in terms of the length of contigs and reconstructed the greatest portion of the genome, achieving a genome assembly of “finished grade” because of its long reads. it showed the potential to assemble more complex genomes with multiple chromosomes containing more repetitive sequences.
