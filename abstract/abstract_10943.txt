BACKGROUND
during early stages of brain development, secreted molecules, components of intracellular signaling pathways and transcriptional regulators act in positive and negative feed-back or feed-forward loops at the mid-hindbrain boundary. these genetic interactions are of central importance for the specification and subsequent development of the adjacent mid- and hindbrain. much less, however, is known about the regulatory relationship and functional interaction of molecules that are expressed in the tectal anlage after tectal fate specification has taken place and tectal development has commenced.


RESULTS
here, we provide experimental evidence for reciprocal regulation and subsequent cooperation of the paired-type transcription factors pax <dig>  pax <dig> and the tale-homeodomain protein meis <dig> in the tectal anlage. using in ovo electroporation of the mesencephalic vesicle of chick embryos we show that  pax <dig> and pax <dig> mutually regulate each other's expression in the mesencephalic vesicle,  meis <dig> acts downstream of pax3/ <dig> and requires balanced expression levels of both proteins, and  meis <dig> physically interacts with pax <dig> and pax <dig>  these results extend our previous observation that meis <dig> cooperates with otx <dig> in tectal development to include pax <dig> and pax <dig> as meis <dig> interacting proteins in the tectal anlage.


CONCLUSIONS
the results described here suggest a model in which interdependent regulatory loops involving pax <dig> and pax <dig> in the dorsal mesencephalic vesicle modulate meis <dig> expression. physical interaction with meis <dig> may then confer tectal specificity to a wide range of otherwise broadly expressed transcriptional regulators, including otx <dig>  pax <dig> and pax <dig>
