BACKGROUND
in a previous study we found that in chickweed the expression level of the pro-smamp <dig> gene was comparable or even higher to that of the β-actin gene. this high level of the gene expression has attracted our attention as an opportunity for the identification of novel strong promoters of plant origin, which could find its application in plant biotechnology. therefore, in the present study we focused on the nucleotide sequence identification and the functional characteristics of the pro-smamp <dig> promoter in transgenic plants.


RESULTS
in chickweed , a 2120 bp promoter region of the pro-smamp <dig> gene encoding antifungal peptides was sequenced. six 5′-deletion variants − <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig>  and −290 bp of pro-smamp <dig> gene promoter were fused with the coding region of the reporter gene gusa in the plant expression vector pcambia1381z. independent transgenic plants of tobacco nicotiana tabacum were obtained with each genetic structure. gus protein activity assay in extracts from transgenic plants showed that all deletion variants of the promoter, except −290 bp, expressed the gusa gene. in most transgenic plants, the gus activity level was comparable or higher than in plants with the viral promoter camv 35s. gus activity remains high in progenies and its level correlates positively with the amount of gusa gene mrna in t <dig> homozygous plants. the activity of the рro-smamp <dig> promoter was detected in all organs of the transgenic plants studied, during meiosis and in pollen as well.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the рro-smamp <dig> promoter can be used for target genes expression control in transgenic plants.
