BACKGROUND
thousands of parthenogenetic animal species have been described and cytogenetic manifestations of this reproductive mode are well known. however, little is understood about the molecular determinants of parthenogenesis. the daphnia pulex genome must contain the molecular machinery for different reproductive modes: sexual  and parthenogenetic . this feature makes d. pulex an ideal model to investigate the genetic basis of parthenogenesis and its consequences for gene and genome evolution. here we describe the inventory of meiotic genes and their expression patterns during meiotic and parthenogenetic reproduction to help address whether parthenogenesis uses existing meiotic and mitotic machinery, or whether novel processes may be involved.


RESULTS
we report an inventory of  <dig> homologs representing over  <dig> genes encoding proteins with diverse roles in meiotic processes in the genome of d. pulex. many genes involved in cell cycle regulation and sister chromatid cohesion are characterized by expansions in copy number. in contrast, most genes involved in dna replication and homologous recombination are present as single copies. notably, recq <dig>  is present in multiple copies while dmc <dig> is the only gene in our inventory that is absent in the daphnia genome. expression patterns for  <dig> gene copies were similar during meiosis versus parthenogenesis, although several genes displayed marked differences in expression level in germline and somatic tissues.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that expansions in meiotic gene families in d. pulex may be associated with parthenogenesis. taking into account our findings, we provide a mechanistic model of parthenogenesis, highlighting steps that must differ from meiosis including sister chromatid cohesion and kinetochore attachment.
