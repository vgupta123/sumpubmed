BACKGROUND
recent technology advances have enabled sequencing of individual genomes, promising to revolutionize biomedical research. however, deep sequencing remains more expensive than microarrays for performing whole-genome snp genotyping.


RESULTS
in this paper we introduce a new multi-locus statistical model and computationally efficient genotype calling algorithms that integrate shotgun sequencing data with linkage disequilibrium  information extracted from reference population panels such as hapmap or the  <dig> genomes project. experiments on publicly available  <dig>  illumina, and abi solid sequencing datasets suggest that integration of ld information results in genotype calling accuracy comparable to that of microarray platforms from sequencing data of low-coverage. a software package implementing our algorithm, released under the gnu general public license, is available at http://dna.engr.uconn.edu/software/geneseq/.


CONCLUSIONS
integration of ld information leads to significant improvements in genotype calling accuracy compared to prior ld-oblivious methods, rendering low-coverage sequencing as a viable alternative to microarrays for conducting large-scale genome-wide association studies.
