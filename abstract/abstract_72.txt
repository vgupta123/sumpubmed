BACKGROUND
many leukemias result from chromosomal rearrangements. the t chromosomal translocation produces aml1-eto, an oncogenic fusion protein that compromises the function of aml <dig>  a transcription factor critical for myeloid cell differentiation. because of the pressing need for new therapies in the treatment of acute myleoid leukemia, we investigated the genome-wide occupancy of aml1-eto in leukemic cells to discover novel regulatory mechanisms involving aml-eto bound genes.


RESULTS
we report the co-localization of aml1-eto with the n-cor co-repressor to be primarily on genomic regions distal to transcriptional start sites . these regions exhibit over-representation of the motif for pu. <dig>  a key hematopoietic regulator and member of the ets family of transcription factors. a significant discovery of our study is that genes co-occupied by aml1-eto and n-cor  are associated with the leukemic phenotype, as determined by analyses of gene ontology and by the observation that these genes are predominantly up-regulated upon aml1-eto depletion. in contrast, the aml1-eto/p <dig> gene network is less responsive to aml1-eto depletion and less associated with the differentiation block characteristic of leukemic cells. furthermore, a substantial fraction of aml1-eto/p <dig> co-localization occurs near tsss in promoter regions associated with transcriptionally active loci.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings establish a novel and dominant t aml leukemia signature characterized by occupancy of aml1-eto/n-cor at promoter-distal genomic regions enriched in motifs for myeloid differentiation factors, thus providing mechanistic insight into the leukemic phenotype.
