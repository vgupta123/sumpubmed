BACKGROUND
cimicoxib is a new coxib anti-inflammatory drug for use in the dog. to determine a preclinical dosage regimen for cimicoxib in dog, a reversible model of kaolin–induced paw inflammation was used. dosage regimens were established using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  modeling approach .


RESULTS
analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic endpoints investigated with the inflammation model established the efficacy of cimicoxib at a dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered orally  in  <dig> beagle dogs.

for both the oral and iv route of administration two groups of dogs to be identified namely poor metabolizers  and extensive metabolizers .the terminal half-life after oral administration was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h for the pm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h for the em groups, with the corresponding values after the iv route being  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h .

the main pharmacodynamic parameters  were estimated for four endpoints . the plasma concentration corresponding to half the maximum of the indirect effect were  <dig> μg/l for creeping speed,  <dig> μg/l for the lameness score,  <dig> μg/l for the ground reaction vertical force and  <dig> μg/l for the body temperature.

to document possible polymorphism of the cimicoxib disposition in the target dog population, cimicoxib was administered by the intravenous route to  <dig> dogs . the cimicoxib half-lives in these  <dig> dogs were of same order of the magnitude as those of the em beagle dogs. thus pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters obtained from the em beagle dogs were selected to simulate the dose-effect relationship of cimicoxib after an oral administration allowing a dosage regimen to be selected for confirmation by a clinical trial.


CONCLUSIONS
cimicoxib was an efficacious anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic drug and a dosage regimen of  <dig> mg/kg daily was determined for confirmatory clinical trials.
