BACKGROUND
several cases of human infection caused by verotoxin-producing escherichia coli  o157:h <dig> in sweden have been connected with cattle farm visits. between  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> farms were classified as the source of human cases with isolation of ehec  after vtec o157:h <dig> had been isolated from cattle on those farms.


RESULTS
characterization by phage typing and molecular methods of the strains isolated from these  <dig> farms, including pcr for virulence genes  and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , demonstrated a cluster of very similar strains from  <dig> farms. all were of phage type  <dig>  carried the genes encoding the verotoxins vt <dig> and vt2c, intimin, ehec-haemolysin and flagellin h <dig> as shown by pcr, and had identical or very similar pfge patterns. when analysing strains in a prevalence study of vtec o157:h <dig> from cattle at slaughter as well as from an on-farm prevalence study of dairy cattle, using the same typing methods, a rather wide variation was observed among the isolated vtec o157:h <dig> strains.


CONCLUSIONS
in sweden, a limited group of genetically similar and highly pathogenic vtec o157:h <dig> strains seem to predominate in direct or indirect transmission from cattle to man.
