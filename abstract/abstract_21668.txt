BACKGROUND
toll-like receptors, which stimulated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as lipopolysaccharides , induces the releasing of many kinds of proinflammatory cytokines to activate subsequent immune responses. plenty of studies have also indicated the importance of tlr-signalling on the avoidance of excessive inflammation, tissue repairing and the return to homeostasis after infection and tissue injury. the significance of tlr-signalling attracts many attentions on the regulatory mechanisms since several years ago. however, as newly discovered regulators, how and how many different micrornas  regulate tlr-signalling pathway are still unclear.


RESULTS
by integrating several microarray datasets and mirna-target information datasets, we identified  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> differentially expressed target genes in bone marrow-derived macrophages  with lps-stimulation. cooperative mirna network were constructed by calculating targets overlap scores, and a sub-network finding algorithm was used to identify cooperative mirna modules. finally,  <dig> and  <dig> modules are identified in the cooperative mirna networks composed of mirnas up-regulate and down-regulate genes, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
we used gene expression data of mouse macrophage stimulated by lps and mirna-target information to infer the regulatory mechanism of mirnas on lps-induced signalling pathway. also, our results suggest that mirnas can be important regulators of lps-induced innate immune response in bmdms.
