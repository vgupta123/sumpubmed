BACKGROUND
some neurodegenerative diseases, such as alzheimer and parkinson, present an olfactory impairment in early stages, and sometimes even before the clinical symptoms begin. in this study, we assess the role of ca <dig> hippocampus  subfield in the rats’ olfactory behavior, and the neuroprotective effect of  <dig> beta estradiol  against the oxidative stress produced by the injection of amyloid beta 25– <dig> 


RESULTS
 <dig> wistar rats were ovariectomized and two weeks after injected with 2 μl of amyloid beta 25– <dig>  in ca <dig> subfield. olfactory behavior was evaluated with a social recognition test, odor discrimination, and search tests. oxidative stress was evaluated with fox assay and western blot against 4-hne, fluoro jade staining was made to quantify degenerated neurons; all these evaluations were performed 24 h,  <dig> or 15 days after a-β25– <dig> injection. three additional groups treated with  <dig> beta estradiol  were also evaluated. the injection of a-β25– <dig> produced an olfactory impairment 24 h and 8 days after, whereas a partial recovery of the olfactory behavior was observed at 15 days. a complete prevention of the olfactory impairment was observed with the administration of e <dig> two weeks before the amyloid injection  and one or two weeks after ; a decrease of the oxidative stress and neurodegeneration were also observed.


CONCLUSIONS
our finding shows that ca <dig> hippocampus subfield plays an important role in the olfactory behavior of the rat. the oxidative stress generated by the administration of a-β25– <dig> is enough to produce an olfactory impairment. this can be prevented with the administration of e <dig> before and after amyloid injection. this suggests a possible therapeutic use of estradiol in alzheimer’s disease.
