BACKGROUND
cog <dig> proteins are, like the nickel chaperones of the ureg family, part of the g3e family of gtpases linking them to metallocenter biosynthesis. even though the first cog0523-encoding gene, cobw, was identified almost  <dig> years ago, little is known concerning the function of other members belonging to this ubiquitous family.


RESULTS
based on a combination of comparative genomics, literature and phylogenetic analyses and experimental validations, the cog <dig> family can be separated into at least fifteen subgroups. the cobw subgroup involved in cobalamin synthesis represents only one small sub-fraction of the family. another, larger subgroup, is suggested to play a predominant role in the response to zinc limitation based on the presence of the corresponding cog0523-encoding genes downstream from putative zur binding sites in many bacterial genomes. zur binding sites in these genomes are also associated with candidate zinc-independent paralogs of zinc-dependent enzymes. finally, the potential role of cog <dig> in zinc homeostasis is not limited to bacteria. we have predicted a link between cog <dig> and regulation by zinc in archaea and show that two cog <dig> genes are induced upon zinc depletion in a eukaryotic reference organism, chlamydomonas reinhardtii.


CONCLUSIONS
this work lays the foundation for the pursuit by experimental methods of the specific role of cog <dig> members in metal trafficking. based on phylogeny and comparative genomics, both the metal specificity and the protein target might vary from one cog <dig> subgroup to another. additionally, zur-dependent expression of cog <dig> and putative paralogs of zinc-dependent proteins may represent a mechanism for hierarchal zinc distribution and zinc sparing in the face of inadequate zinc nutrition.
