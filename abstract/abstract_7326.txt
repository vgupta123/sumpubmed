BACKGROUND
rust fungi are an important group of plant pathogens that cause devastating losses in agricultural, silvicultural and natural ecosystems. plants can be protected from rust disease by resistance genes encoding receptors that trigger a highly effective defence response upon recognition of specific pathogen avirulence proteins. identifying avirulence genes is crucial for understanding how virulence evolves in the field.


RESULTS
to facilitate avirulence gene cloning in the flax rust fungus, melampsora lini, we constructed a high-density genetic linkage map using single nucleotide polymorphisms detected in restriction site-associated dna sequencing  data. the map comprises  <dig>  radseq markers in  <dig> linkage groups that together span  <dig> cm and contain  <dig> recombination bins. the marker sequences were used to anchor  <dig>  % of the m. lini genome assembly onto the genetic map. the map and anchored assembly were then used to: 1) show that m. lini has a high overall meiotic recombination rate, but recombination distribution is uneven and large coldspots exist; 2) show that substantial genome rearrangements have occurred in spontaneous loss-of-avirulence mutants; and 3) identify the avrl <dig> and avrm <dig> avirulence genes by map-based cloning. avrm <dig> is a dual-specificity avirulence gene that encodes a predicted nudix hydrolase. avrl <dig> is located in the region of the m. lini genome with the lowest recombination rate and encodes a small, highly-charged proline-rich protein.


CONCLUSIONS
the m. lini high-density linkage map has greatly advanced our understanding of virulence mechanisms in this pathogen by providing novel insights into genome variability and enabling identification of two new avirulence genes.
