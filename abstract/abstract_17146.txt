BACKGROUND
the laboratory rat  is an important model for human disease, and is extensively used for studying complex traits for example in the physiological and pharmacological fields. to facilitate genetic studies like qtl mapping, genetic makers that can be easily typed, like snps, are essential.


RESULTS
a genome-wide set of  <dig> snp assays was designed for the kaspar genotyping platform, which uses a technique based on allele specific oligo extension and energy transfer-based detection. snps were chosen to be equally spread along all chromosomes except y and to be polymorphic between brown norway and ss or wistar rat strains based on data from the rat hapmap eu project. this panel was tested on  <dig> rats of  <dig> different strains and  <dig> wild rats to determine the level of polymorphism and to generate a phylogenetic network to show their genetic relationships. as a proof of principle we used this panel to map an obesity trait in zucker rats and confirmed significant linkage  to chromosome 5: 119â€“ <dig> mb, where the leptin receptor gene  is located .


CONCLUSIONS
we provide a fast and cost-effective platform for genome-wide snp typing, which can be used for first-pass genetic mapping and association studies in a wide variety of rat strains.
