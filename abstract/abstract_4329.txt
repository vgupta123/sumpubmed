BACKGROUND
pearl millet  is a widely cultivated drought- and high-temperature tolerant c <dig> cereal grown under dryland, rainfed and irrigated conditions in drought-prone regions of the tropics and sub-tropics of africa, south asia and the americas. it is considered an orphan crop with relatively few genomic and genetic resources. this study was undertaken to increase the est-based microsatellite marker and genetic resources for this crop to facilitate marker-assisted breeding.


RESULTS
newly developed est-ssr markers , along with previously mapped est-ssr , genomic ssr  and sts  markers, were used to construct linkage maps of four f <dig> recombinant inbred populations  based on crosses icmb 841-p <dig> × 863b-p <dig> , h 77/833- <dig> × prlt 2/89- <dig> , 81b-p <dig> × icmp 451-p <dig>  and pt 732b-p <dig> × p1449-2-p <dig> . mapped loci numbers were greatest for rip a , followed by rip b , rip c  and rip d . total map lengths  were 615 cm, 690 cm, 428 cm and 276 cm, respectively. a total of  <dig> loci detected by  <dig> primer pairs were mapped among the four crosses. a consensus map of  <dig> loci  detected by  <dig> primer pairs was constructed using mergemap to integrate the individual linkage maps. locus order in the consensus map was well conserved for nearly all linkage groups. eighty-nine est-ssr marker loci from this consensus map had significant blast hits  on the genome sequences of rice, foxtail millet, sorghum, maize and brachypodium with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> loci, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the consensus map developed in the present study contains the largest set of mapped ssrs reported to date for pearl millet, and represents a major consolidation of existing pearl millet genetic mapping information. this study increased numbers of mapped pearl millet ssr markers by >50%, filling important gaps in previously published ssr-based linkage maps for this species and will greatly facilitate ssr-based qtl mapping and applied marker-assisted selection programs.
