BACKGROUND
the cyclic diguanylate  is currently considered an ubiquitous second messenger in bacteria that influences a wide range of cellular processes. one of the methodological approaches to unravel c-di-gmp regulatory networks involves raising the c-di-gmp intracellular levels, e.g. by expressing a diguanylate cyclase , to provoke phenotypic changes.


RESULTS
we have constructed mini-tn <dig> delivery vectors for the integration and stable expression of the pled* gene encoding a highly active dgc, which can be used to artificially increase the intracellular levels of c-di-gmp in gram negative bacteria. the functionality of these new vectors has been validated in several plant-interacting α- and γ-proteobacteria. similarly to vector plasmid-borne pled*, the genome-borne mini-tn7pled* constructs provide significant increases in intracellular c-di-gmp, provoking expected phenotypic changes such as enhanced polysaccharide production, biofilm formation and reduced motility. however, the mini-tn7pled* constructs resulted far more stable in the absence of antibiotics than the plasmid-based pled* constructs. furthermore, we have also implemented an inducible system to modulate pled* expression and intracellular c-di-gmp rises “on demand”.


CONCLUSIONS
mini-tn7pled* constructs are very stable and are maintained during bacterial free-living growth as well as during interaction with eukaryotic hosts, in the absence of selective pressure. this high stability ensures experimental homogeneity in time and space with regard to enhancing c-di-gmp intracellular levels in bacteria of interest.
