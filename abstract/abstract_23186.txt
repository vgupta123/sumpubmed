BACKGROUND
eukaryotic cells possess a complex network of rna machineries which function in rna-processing and cellular regulation which includes transcription, translation, silencing, editing and epigenetic control. studies of model organisms have shown that many ncrnas of the rna-infrastructure are highly conserved, but little is known from non-model protists. in this study we have conducted a genome-scale survey of medium-length ncrnas from the protozoan parasites giardia intestinalis and trichomonas vaginalis.


RESULTS
we have identified the previously 'missing' giardia rnase mrp rna, which is a key ribozyme involved in pre-rrna processing. we have also uncovered  <dig> new h/aca box snornas, expanding our knowledge of the h/aca family of snornas.


CONCLUSIONS
results indicate that giardia intestinalis and trichomonas vaginalis, like their distant multicellular relatives, contain a rich infrastructure of rna-based processing. from here we can investigate the evolution of rna processing networks in eukaryotes.
