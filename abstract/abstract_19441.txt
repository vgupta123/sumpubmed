BACKGROUND
information about the genotypic characteristic of coxiella burnetii from hungary is lacking. the aim of this study is to describe the genetic diversity of c. burnetii in hungary and compare genotypes with those found elsewhere. a total of  <dig> samples:  collected from across hungary were studied by a 10-loci multispacer sequence typing  and 6-loci multiple-locus variable-number of tandem repeat analysis . phylogenetic relationships among mst genotypes show how these hungarian samples are related to others collected around the world.


RESULTS
three mst genotypes were identified: sequence type   <dig> has also been identified in ruminants from other european countries and the usa, st <dig> was previously identified in kazakhstan, and the proposed st <dig> is novel. all mst genotypes yielded different mlva genotypes and three different mlva genotypes were identified within st <dig> samples alone. two novel mlva types 0-9-5-5-6- <dig>  and 0-8-4-5-6- <dig>   were defined in the ovine materials correlated with st <dig> and st <dig>  samples from different parts of the phylogenetic tree were associated with different hosts, suggesting host-specific adaptations.


CONCLUSIONS
even with the limited number of samples analysed, this study revealed high genetic diversity among c. burnetii in hungary. understanding the background genetic diversity will be essential in identifying and controlling outbreaks.
