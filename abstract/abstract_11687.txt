BACKGROUND
long noncoding rnas  are involved in regulating animal development, however, their function in the onset of puberty in goats remain largely unexplored. to identify the genes controlling the regulation of puberty in goats, we measured lncrna and mrna expression levels from the hypothalamus.


RESULTS
we applied rna sequencing analysis to examine the hypothalamus of pubertal  and prepubertal  goats. our results showed  <dig> predicted lncrnas, including  <dig> differentially expressed lncrnas, which corresponded to  <dig> target genes. we also investigated the role of lncrnas that act cis and trans to the target genes and found a number of lncrnas involved in the regulation of puberty and reproduction, as well as several pathways related to these processes. for example, oxytocin signaling pathway, sterol biosynthetic process, and pheromone receptor activity signaling pathway were enriched as kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  or gene ontology  analyses showed.


CONCLUSIONS
our results clearly demonstrate that lncrnas play an important role in regulating puberty in goats. however, further research is needed to explore the functions of lncrnas and their predicted targets to provide a detailed expression profile of lncrnas on goat puberty.
