BACKGROUND
the freshwater planarian schmidtea mediterranea exhibits two distinct reproductive modes. individuals of the sexual strain are cross-fertilizing hermaphrodites with reproductive organs that develop post-embryonically. by contrast, individuals of the asexual strain reproduce exclusively by transverse fission and fail to develop reproductive organs. these different reproductive strains are associated with distinct karyotypes, making s. mediterranea a useful model for studying germline development and sexual differentiation.


RESULTS
to identify genes expressed differentially between these strains, we performed microarray analyses and identified > <dig> genes that were upregulated in the sexual planarian. from these, we characterized  <dig> genes by fluorescent in situ hybridization , revealing their expression in male germ cells or accessory reproductive organs. to identify additional markers of the planarian reproductive system, we also used immuno- and fluorescent lectin staining, identifying several antibodies and lectins that labeled structures associated with reproductive organs.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, these cell-type specific markers will enable future efforts to characterize genes that are important for reproductive development in the planarian.
