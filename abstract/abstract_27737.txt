BACKGROUND
transcriptional profiling using microarrays has developed into a key molecular tool for the elucidation of gene function and gene regulation. microarray platforms based on either oligonucleotides or purified amplification products have been utilised in parallel to produce large amounts of data. irrespective of platform examined, the availability of genome sequence or a large number of representative expressed sequence tags  is, however, a pre-requisite for the design and selection of specific and high-quality microarray probes. this is of great importance for organisms, such as arabidopsis thaliana, with a high number of duplicated genes, as cross-hybridisation signals between evolutionary related genes cannot be distinguished from true signals unless the probes are carefully designed to be specific.


RESULTS
we present an alternative solid-phase purification strategy suitable for efficient preparation of short, biotinylated and highly specific probes suitable for large-scale expression profiling. twenty-one thousand arabidopsis thaliana gene sequence tags were amplified and subsequently purified using the described technology. the use of the arrays is exemplified by analysis of gene expression changes caused by a four-hour indole-3-acetic  treatment. a total of  <dig> genes were identified as differentially expressed , including several previously known auxin-affected genes, but also several previously uncharacterised genes.


CONCLUSIONS
the described solid-phase procedure can be used to prepare gene sequence tag microarrays based on short and specific amplified probes, facilitating the analysis of more than  <dig>  <dig> arabidopsis transcripts.
