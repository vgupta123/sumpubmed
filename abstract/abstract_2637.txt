BACKGROUND
the bone marrow is a hematopoietic tissue that, in the presence of cytokines and growth factors, generates all of the circulating blood cells. these cells are important for protecting the organism against pathogens and for establishing an effective immune response. previous studies have shown immunomodulatory effects of different products isolated from plant extracts. this study aimed to evaluate the immunomodulatory properties of aqueous physalis angulata  extract on the differentiation of bone marrow cells.


RESULTS
increased cellular area, higher spreading ability and several cytoplasmatic projections were observed in the treated cells, using optical microscopy, suggesting cell differentiation. furthermore, aepa did not promote the proliferation of lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, however promotes increased the number of macrophages in the culture. the ultrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy of treated cells showed spreading ability, high number of cytoplasmatic projections and increase of autophagic vacuoles. moreover, a high level of lc3b expression by treated cells was detected by flow cytometry, suggesting an autophagic process. cell surface expression of f4/ <dig> and cd11b also indicated that aepa may stimulate differentiation of bone marrow cells mainly into macrophages. in addition, aepa did not differentiate cells into dendritic cells, as assessed by cd11c analysis. furthermore, no cytotoxic effects were observed in the cells treated with aepa.


CONCLUSIONS
results demonstrate that aepa promotes the differentiation of bone marrow cells, particularly into macrophages and may hold promise as an immunomodulating agent.
