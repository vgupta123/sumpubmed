BACKGROUND
in the history of population genetics balancing selection has been considered as an important evolutionary force, yet until today little is known about its abundance and its effect on patterns of genetic diversity. several well-known examples of balancing selection have been reported from humans, mice, plants, and parasites. however, only very few systematic studies have been carried out to detect genes under balancing selection. we performed a genome scan in drosophila melanogaster to find signatures of balancing selection in a derived  and an ancestral  population. we screened a total of  <dig> genomes searching for regions of high genetic diversity and an excess of snps with intermediate frequency.


RESULTS
in total, we found  <dig> candidate genes:  <dig> in the european population and  <dig> in the african one, with only three genes shared between both populations. most differences between both populations were observed on the x chromosome, though this might be partly due to false positives. functionally, we find an overrepresentation of genes involved in neuronal development and circadian rhythm. furthermore, some of the top genes we identified are involved in innate immunity.


CONCLUSIONS
our results revealed evidence of genes under balancing selection in european and african populations. more candidate genes have been found in the european population. they are involved in several different functions.
