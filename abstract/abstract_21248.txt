BACKGROUND
the effect of single and multiple amino acid substitutions in the green fluorescent protein  from aequorea victoria has been extensively explored, yielding several proteins of diverse spectral properties. however, the role of amino acid deletions in this protein -as with most proteins- is still unknown, due to the technical difficulties involved in generating combinatorial in-phase amino acid deletions on a target region.


RESULTS
in this study, the region i129-l <dig> of superglo gfp , corresponding to the longest loop of the protein and located far away from the central chromophore, was subjected to a random amino acid deletion approach, employing an in-house recently developed mutagenesis method termed codon-based random deletion . only two mutants out of  <dig> possible variant proteins retained fluorescence: sggfp-Δ i <dig> and sggfp-Δ d <dig>  interestingly, both mutants were thermosensitive and at 30°c sggfp-Δ d <dig> was more fluorescent than the parent protein. in contrast with deletions, substitutions of single amino acids from residues f <dig> to l <dig> were well tolerated. the substitution analysis revealed a particular importance of residues f <dig>  g <dig>  i <dig>  l <dig>  h <dig> and l <dig> for the stability of the protein.


CONCLUSIONS
the behavior of gfp variants with both amino acid deletions and substitutions demonstrate that this loop is playing an important structural role in gfp folding. some of the amino acids which tolerated any substitution but no deletion are simply acting as "spacers" to localize important residues in the protein structure.
