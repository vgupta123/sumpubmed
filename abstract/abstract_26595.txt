BACKGROUND
copy number variations  have been shown to account for substantial portions of observed genomic variation and have been associated with qualitative and quantitative traits and the onset of disease in a number of species. information from high-resolution studies to detect, characterize and estimate population-specific variant frequencies will facilitate the incorporation of cnvs in genomic studies to identify genes affecting traits of importance.


RESULTS
genome-wide cnvs were detected in high-density single nucleotide polymorphism  genotyping data from  <dig>  nelore  cattle, and in ngs data from eight key ancestral bulls. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  distinct cnvs were observed, respectively. cross-comparisons of results obtained for the eight resequenced animals revealed that 92 % of the cnvs were observed in both datasets, while 62 % of all detected cnvs were observed to overlap with previously validated cattle copy number variant regions . observed cnvs were used for obtaining breed-specific cnv frequencies and identification of cnvrs, which were subsequently used for gene annotation. a total of  <dig> of the detected cnvrs were observed to overlap with  <dig> non-redundant qtls associated with important production traits in cattle. all of  <dig> cnvs previously reported to be associated with milk production traits in holsteins were also observed in nelore cattle. comparisons of estimated frequencies of these cnvs in the two breeds revealed  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> regions in high , low  and divergent  frequencies, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
obtained results significantly enriched the bovine cnv map and enabled the identification of variants that are potentially associated with traits under selection in nelore cattle, particularly in genome regions harboring qtls affecting production traits.
