BACKGROUND
pig  is a major source of dietary proteins for human consumption and is becoming a valuable model in agricultural and biomedical research. the recently developed isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation  method allows sensitive and accurate protein quantification. here, we performed the first itraq-based quantitative proteomic analyses of landrace  and wuzhishan  pig longissimus dorsi muscle tissues during early embryonic development.


RESULTS
the itraq-based early embryonic longissimus dorsi muscle study of lr and wzs ranging from  <dig> to 42 days post coitus  identified a total of  <dig> proteins from <dig>  peptides, which were matched with  <dig>  spectra at a false discovery rate of 5 %. in both wzs and lr, the largest amount of differentially expressed proteins  were found between  <dig> and  <dig> dpc.  <dig> breed-deps were selected by go analysis, including  <dig> myofibrillar proteins. only myhci/iia mrna were detected due to early embryonic stages, and significantly higher expression of them were found in wzs during these  <dig> stages. myhci was first found in wzs at  <dig> dpc and expressed in both breeds at later stages, while myhcii protein was not detected until  <dig> dpc in both breeds. thus,  <dig> myogenic breed-deps selected from last two stages were analyzed by string, which showed that some myofibrillar proteins  and functional proteins , together with candidate myogenic proteins , probably participate in the regulatory network of myofiber formation.


CONCLUSIONS
our itraq-based early embryonic longissimus dorsi muscle study of lr and wzs provides new data on the in vivo muscle development distinctions during early embryonic development, which contributes to the improved understanding in the regulation mechanism of early myogenesis in agricultural animals.
