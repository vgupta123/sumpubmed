BACKGROUND
beta-carotene is the main dietary precursor of vitamin a. potato tubers contain low levels of carotenoids, composed mainly of the xanthophylls lutein  and violaxanthin . none of these carotenoids have provitamin a activity. we have previously shown that tuber-specific silencing of the first step in the epsilon-beta branch, lcy-e, redirects metabolic flux towards beta-beta carotenoids, increases total carotenoids up to  <dig> -fold and beta-carotene up to 14-fold.


RESULTS
in this work, we silenced the non-heme beta-carotene hydroxylases chy <dig> and chy <dig> in the tuber. real time rt-pcr measurements confirmed the tuber-specific silencing of both genes . chy silenced tubers showed more dramatic changes in carotenoid content than lcy-e silenced tubers, with beta-carotene increasing up to 38-fold and total carotenoids up to  <dig> -fold. these changes were accompanied by a decrease in the immediate product of beta-carotene hydroxylation, zeaxanthin, but not of the downstream xanthophylls, viola- and neoxanthin. changes in endogenous gene expression were extensive and partially overlapping with those of lcy-e silenced tubers: crtiso, lcy-b and zep were induced in both cases, indicating that they may respond to the balance between individual carotenoid species.


CONCLUSIONS
together with epsilon-cyclization of lycopene, beta-carotene hydroxylation is another regulatory step in potato tuber carotenogenesis. the data are consistent with a prevalent role of chy <dig>  which is highly expressed in tubers, in the control of this step. combination of different engineering strategies holds good promise for the manipulation of tuber carotenoid content.
