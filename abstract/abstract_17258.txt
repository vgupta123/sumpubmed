BACKGROUND
cis-natural antisense transcripts  are rnas transcribed from the antisense strand of a gene locus, and are complementary to the rna transcribed from the sense strand. common techniques including microarray approach and analysis of transcriptome databases are the major ways to globally identify cis-nats in various eukaryotic organisms. genome-wide in silico analysis has identified a large number of cis-nats that may generate endogenous short interfering rnas , which participate in important biogenesis mechanisms for transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in rice. however, the transcriptomes are yet to be deeply sequenced to comprehensively investigate cis-nats.


RESULTS
we applied high-throughput strand-specific complementary dna sequencing technology  to deeply sequence mrna for assessing sense and antisense transcripts that were derived under salt, drought and cold stresses, and normal conditions, in the model plant rice . combined with rap-db genome annotation ,  <dig>  transcripts corresponding to  <dig>  unique gene loci were assembled, in which  <dig> gene loci were newly identified. of  <dig> putative rice cis-nats,  <dig> were detected as expressed and giving rise to small rnas from their overlapping regions through integrated analysis of ssrna-seq data and small rna data. among them,  <dig> cis-nats seemed to be associated with specific conditions. the deep sequence data from isolated epidermal cells of rice seedlings further showed that  <dig> % of cis-nats were expressed simultaneously in a population of homogenous cells. nearly  <dig> % of rice transcripts were involved in one-to-one or many-to-many cis-nats formation. furthermore, only  <dig> - <dig> % of  <dig> many-to-many cis-nat groups were all expressed and generated nat-sirnas, indicating that only some cis-nat groups may be involved in complex regulatory networks.


CONCLUSIONS
our study profiles an abundance of cis-nats and nat-sirnas in rice. these data are valuable for gaining insight into the complex function of the rice transcriptome.
