BACKGROUND
in huntington's disease , age at neurological onset is inversely correlated with the length of the cag trinucleotide repeat mutation, but can be modified by genetic factors beyond the hd gene. association of a relatively infrequent  <dig> taa allele of a trinucleotide repeat polymorphism in the grik <dig> 3'utr with earlier than expected age at neurological onset has been suggested to reflect linkage disequilibrium with a functional polymorphism in grik <dig> or an adjacent gene.


RESULTS
we have tested this hypothesis by sequencing all grik <dig> exons, the exon-flanking sequences and 3'utr in several individuals who were crucial to demonstrating the modifier effect, as they showed much earlier age at neurological onset than would be expected from the length of their hd cag mutation. though ten known snps were detected, no sequence variants were found in coding or adjacent sequence that could explain the modifier effect by linkage disequilibrium with the  <dig> taa allele. haplotype analysis using microsatellites, known snps and new variants discovered in the 3'utr argues against a common ancestral origin for the  <dig> taa repeat alleles in these individuals.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that the modifier effect is actually due to the taa repeat itself, possibly via a functional consequence on the grik <dig> mrna.
