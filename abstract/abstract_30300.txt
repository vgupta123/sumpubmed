BACKGROUND

pasteurella multocida b: <dig> causes bovine haemorrhagic septicaemia , leading to rapid fatalities in cattle and buffaloes. an attenuated derivative of p. multocida b: <dig> gdh <dig>  was previously constructed through mutation of the gdha gene and proved to be an effective live attenuated vaccine for hs. currently, only two potential live attenuated vaccine candidates for hs are being reported; p. multocida b: <dig> gdh <dig> and p. multocida b: <dig> jrmt <dig>  this study primarily aims to investigate the potential of p. multocida b: <dig> gdh <dig> strain as a delivery vehicle for dna vaccine for future multivalent applications.


RESULTS
an investigation on the adherence, invasion and intracellular survival of bacterial strains within the bovine aortic endothelial cell line  were carried out. the potential vaccine strain, p. multocida b: <dig> gdh <dig>  was significantly better  at adhering to and invading baec compared to its parent strain and to p. multocida b: <dig> jrmt <dig> and survived intracellularly 7 h post treatment, with a steady decline over time. a dual reporter plasmid, psrgm, which enabled tracking of bacterial movement from the extracellular environment into the intracellular compartment of the mammalian cells, was subsequently transformed into p. multocida b: <dig> gdh <dig>  intracellular trafficking of the vaccine strain, p. multocida b: <dig> gdh <dig> was subsequently visualized by tracking the reporter proteins via confocal laser scanning microscopy .


CONCLUSIONS
the ability of p. multocida b: <dig> gdh <dig> to model bactofection represents a possibility for this vaccine strain to be used as a delivery vehicle for dna vaccine for future multivalent protection in cattle and buffaloes.
