BACKGROUND
a large number of bioinformatics applications in the fields of bio-sequence analysis, molecular evolution and population genetics typically share input/ouput methods, data storage requirements and data analysis algorithms. such common features may be conveniently bundled into re-usable libraries, which enable the rapid development of new methods and robust applications.


RESULTS
we present bio++, a set of object oriented libraries written in c++. available components include classes for data storage and handling , various input/output formats, basic sequence manipulation , phylogenetic analysis , population genetics/genomics  and various algorithms for numerical calculus.


CONCLUSIONS
implementation of methods aims at being both efficient and user-friendly. a special concern was given to the library design to enable easy extension and new methods development. we defined a general hierarchy of classes that allow the developer to implement its own algorithms while remaining compatible with the rest of the libraries. bio++ source code is distributed free of charge under the cecill general public licence from its website .
