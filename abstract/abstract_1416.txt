BACKGROUND
the western african clawed frog xenopus tropicalis is an anuran amphibian species now used as model in vertebrate comparative genomics. it provides the same advantages as xenopus laevis but is diploid and has a smaller genome of  <dig>  gbp. therefore x. tropicalis is more amenable to systematic transcriptome surveys. we initiated a large-scale partial cdna sequencing project to provide a functional genomics resource on genes expressed in the nervous system during early embryogenesis and metamorphosis in x. tropicalis.


RESULTS
a gene index was defined and analysed after the collection of over  <dig>  high quality sequences. these partial cdna sequences were obtained from an embryonic head and retina library  and from a metamorphic brain and spinal cord library . these ests are estimated to represent  <dig>  transcripts derived from an estimated  <dig>  genes. comparison of these cdna sequences with protein databases indicates that 46% contain their start codon. further annotation included gene ontology functional classification, interpro domain analysis, alternative splicing and non-coding rna identification. gene expression profiles were derived from est counts and used to define transcripts specific to metamorphic stages of development. moreover, these ests allowed identification of a set of  <dig> polymorphic microsatellites that can be used as genetic markers.


CONCLUSIONS
these cdna sequences permit in silico cloning of numerous genes and will facilitate studies aimed at deciphering the roles of cognate genes expressed in the nervous system during neural development and metamorphosis. the genomic resources developed to study x. tropicalis biology will accelerate exploration of amphibian physiology and genetics. in particular, the model will facilitate analysis of key questions related to anuran embryogenesis and metamorphosis and its associated regulatory processes.
