BACKGROUND
the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex <dig>  signaling pathway has been implicated in functions of multicellular processes, including cell growth and metabolism. although recent reports showed that many signaling pathways, including activin, bmp, fgf, sonic hedgehog, insulin-like growth factor , notch, retinoic acid, and wnt, are implicated in non-mammalian vertebrate regeneration, also known as epimorphic regeneration, mtorc <dig> function remains unknown.


RESULTS
to investigate the role of mtorc <dig> signaling pathway in zebrafish caudal fin, we examined the activation and function of mtorc <dig> signaling using an antibody against phosphorylated s <dig> kinase and a specific inhibitor, rapamycin. mtorc <dig> signaling is activated in proliferative cells of intra-ray and wound epidermal cells before blastema formation, as well as in proliferative blastema cells, wound epidermal cells, and osteoblasts during regenerative outgrowth. before blastema formation, proliferation of intra-ray and wound epidermal cells is suppressed, but cell death is not affected by mtorc <dig> signaling inhibition with rapamycin. moreover, rapamycin treatment inhibits blastema and wound epidermal cell proliferation and survival during blastema formation and regenerative outgrowth, as well as osteoblast proliferation and differentiation during regenerative outgrowth. we further determined that mtorc <dig> signaling is regulated through igf- <dig> receptor/phosphatidylinositol- <dig> kinase and wnt pathways during fin regeneration.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our findings reveal that mtorc <dig> signaling regulates proliferation, survival, and differentiation of intra-ray cells, wound epidermis, blastema cells, and/or osteoblasts in various fin regeneration stages downstream of igf and wnt signaling pathways.
