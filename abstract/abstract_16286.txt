BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus  infections range in severity due to expression of certain virulence factors encoded on mobile genetic elements . as such, characterization of these mge, as well as single nucleotide polymorphisms, is of high clinical and microbiological importance. to understand the evolution of these dangerous pathogens, it is paramount to define reference strains that may predate mge acquisition. one such candidate is s. aureus tager  <dig>  a previously uncharacterized strain isolated from a patient with impetigo in  <dig> 


RESULTS
we show here that s. aureus tager  <dig> can survive in the bloodstream and infect naïve organs. we also demonstrate a procedure to construct and validate the assembly of s. aureus genomes, using tager  <dig> as a proof-of-concept. in so doing, we bridged confounding gap regions that limited our initial attempts to close this  <dig>  mb genome, through integration of data from illumina nextera paired-end, pacbio rs, and lucigen nxseq mate-pair libraries. furthermore, we provide independent confirmation of our segmental arrangement of the tager  <dig> genome by the sole use of lucigen nxseq libraries filled by paired-end miseq reads and alignment with spades software. genomic analysis of tager  <dig> revealed limited mge, and a νsaβ island configuration that is reminiscent of other hospital acquired s. aureus genomes.


CONCLUSIONS
tager  <dig> represents an early-branching ancestor of certain hospital-acquired strains. combined with its earlier isolation date and limited content of mge, tager  <dig> can serve as a viable reference for future comparative genome studies.
