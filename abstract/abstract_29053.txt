BACKGROUND
chemokines play multiple roles in the development and progression in a variety of tumors. chemokine  ligand  <dig>  has been found associated with pro-inflammatory responses, but its role in cancer growth remains unclear. our previous study showed that r phase tumor infiltrating lymphocytes  produced large amounts of interleukin - <dig> which antagonized transforming growth factor -β derived from ctvt to diminish the immune-suppressive microenvironment. now we intend to determine the expression pattern of cxcl <dig> and the role of il-6/tgf-β in cxcl <dig> induction during spontaneous progressive  and regressive  phases in canine transmissible venereal tumor .


RESULTS
we have demonstrated that cxcl <dig> expressed at high level in p phase and down-regulated in r phase by western blot and real-time pcr. this suggested that cxcl <dig> expression was negatively correlated with the tumor growth. co-culturing tils with ctvt cells was found to reduce cxcl <dig> expression, while adding il- <dig> blocking antibody reversed it. moreover, in p phase ctvt, while il-1β and tgf-β had no obvious effect on cxcl <dig> expression, il- <dig> was found significantly to reduce cxcl <dig> expression in a dose-dependent manner. the mrna expression results of cxcl <dig> receptor, cxcr <dig>  further confirmed the effects of il- <dig> concentration on the cxcl <dig> expression.


CONCLUSIONS
cxcl <dig> overexpression might be associated with the progressive growth of ctvt. the results shown here also suggest the role of cxcl <dig> in cancer development and the potential as the anti-cancer therapeutic target.
