BACKGROUND
intracellular bacterial pathogens depend on acquisition of iron for their success as pathogens. the host cell requires iron as an essential component for cellular functions that include innate immune defense mechanisms. the transferrin receptor tfr <dig> plays an important part for delivering iron to the host cell during infection. its expression can be modulated by infection, but its essentiality for bacterial intracellular survival has not been directly investigated.


RESULTS
we identified two distinct iron-handling scenarios for two different bacterial pathogens. francisella tularensis drives an active iron acquisition program via the tfr <dig> pathway program with induction of ferrireductase , iron membrane transporter dmt <dig>  and iron regulatory proteins irp <dig> and irp <dig>  which is associated with a sustained increase of the labile iron pool inside the macrophage. expression of tfr <dig> is critical for francisella's intracellular proliferation. this contrasts with infection of macrophages by wild-type salmonella typhimurium, which does not require expression of tfr <dig> for successful intracellular survival. macrophages infected with salmonella lack significant induction of dmt <dig>  steap <dig>  and irp <dig>  and maintain their labile iron pool at normal levels.


CONCLUSIONS
the distinction between two different phenotypes of iron utilization by intracellular pathogens will allow further characterization and understanding of host-cell iron metabolism and its modulation by intracellular bacteria.
