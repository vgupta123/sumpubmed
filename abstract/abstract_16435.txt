BACKGROUND
topoisomerase iiα has been shown to be down-regulated in doxorubicin-resistant cell lines. the specificity proteins sp <dig> and sp <dig> have been implicated in regulation of topoisomerase iiα transcription, although the mechanism by which they regulate expression is not fully understood. sp <dig> has been shown to bind specifically to both proximal and distal gc elements of the human topoisomerase iiα promoter in vitro, while sp <dig> binds only to the distal gc element unless additional flanking sequences are included. while sp <dig> is thought to be an activator of human topoisomerase iiα, the functional significance of sp <dig> binding is not known. therefore, we sought to determine the functional relationship between sp <dig> and sp <dig> binding to the topoisomerase iiα promoter in vivo. we investigated endogenous levels of sp <dig>  sp <dig> and topoisomerase iiα as well as binding of both sp <dig> and sp <dig> to the gc boxes of the topoisomerase iiα promoter in breast cancer cell lines in vivo after short term doxorubicin exposure.


RESULTS
functional effects of sp <dig> and sp <dig> were studied using transient cotransfection assays using a topoisomerase iiα promoter reporter construct. the in vivo interactions of sp <dig> and sp <dig> with the gc elements of the topoisomerase iiα promoter were studied in doxorubicin-treated breast cancer cell lines using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. relative amounts of endogenous proteins were measured using immunoblotting. in vivo dna looping mediated by proteins bound at the gc <dig> and gc <dig> elements was studied using the chromatin conformation capture assay. both sp <dig> and sp <dig> bound to the gc <dig> and gc <dig> regions. sp <dig> and sp <dig> were transcriptional activators and repressors respectively, with sp <dig> repression being dominant over sp1-mediated activation. the gc <dig> and gc <dig> elements are linked in vivo to form a loop, thus bringing distal regulatory elements and their cognate transcription factors into close proximity with the transcription start site.


CONCLUSIONS
these observations provide a mechanistic explanation for the modulation of topoisomerase iiα and concomitant down-regulation that can be mediated by topoisomerase ii poisons. competition between sp <dig> and sp <dig> for the same cognate dna would result in activation or repression depending on absolute amounts of each transcription factor in cells treated with doxorubicin.
