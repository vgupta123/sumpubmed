BACKGROUND
mariner-like elements  are widespread dna transposons in animal genomes. although in vitro transposition reactions require only the transposase, various factors depending on the host, the physico-chemical environment and the transposon sequence can interfere with the mles transposition in vivo.


RESULTS
the transposition of mos <dig>  first isolated from drosophila mauritiana, depends of both the nucleic acid sequence of the dna stuffer , and its length. we provide the first in vitro experimental demonstration that mites of mle origin, as small as  <dig> to 120-bp, are able to transpose. excessive temperature down-regulates mos <dig> transposition, yielding excision products unable to re-integrate. finally, the super-helicity of the dna transposon donor has a dramatic impact on the transposition efficiency.


CONCLUSIONS
the study highlights how experimental conditions can bias interpretation of mariner excision frequency and quality. in vitro, the auto-integration pathway markedly limits transposition efficiency to new target sites, and this phenomenon may also limit events in the natural host. we propose a model for small transposons transposition that bypasses dna bending constraints.
