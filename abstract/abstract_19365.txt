BACKGROUND
insects and animals can recognize surrounding environments by detecting thousands of chemical odorants. olfaction is a complicated process that begins in the olfactory epithelium with the specific binding of volatile odorant molecules to dedicated olfactory receptors . or proteins are encoded by the largest gene superfamily in the mammalian genome.


RESULTS
we report here the whole genome analysis of the olfactory receptor genes of s. scrofa using conserved or gene specific motifs and known or protein sequences from diverse species. we identified  <dig>  or related sequences from the s. scrofa genome assembly, sscrofa <dig> , including  <dig>  functional or genes and  <dig> pseudogenes. or genes were located in  <dig> different regions on  <dig> pig chromosomes. we classified the ors into  <dig> families, three class i and  <dig> class ii families, and further grouped them into  <dig> subfamilies. we also identified inter- and intra-chromosomal duplications of or genes residing on  <dig> chromosomes. a significant number of pig or genes  showed less than 60% amino acid sequence similarity to known or genes of other species.


CONCLUSIONS
as the genome assembly sscrofa <dig>  covers  <dig> % of the pig genome, our analysis represents an almost complete or gene repertoire from an individual pig genome. we show that s. scrofa has one of the largest or repertoires, suggesting an expansion of or genes in the swine genome. a significant number of unique or genes in the pig genome may suggest the presence of swine specific olfactory stimulation.
