BACKGROUND
circadian oscillation of clock-controlled gene expression is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level. heterodimers of clock and bmal <dig> act as activators of target gene transcription; however, interactions of per and cry proteins with the heterodimer abolish its transcriptional activation capacity. per and cry are therefore referred to as negative regulators of the circadian clock. to further elucidate the mechanism how positive and negative components of the clock interplay, we characterized the interactions of per <dig>  cry <dig> and cry <dig> with bmal <dig> and clock using a mammalian two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation assays.


RESULTS
both per <dig> and the cry proteins were found to interact with bmal <dig> whereas only per <dig> interacts with clock. cry proteins seem to have a higher affinity to bmal <dig> than per <dig>  moreover, we provide evidence that per <dig>  cry <dig> and cry <dig> bind to different domains in the bmal <dig> protein.


CONCLUSIONS
the regulators of clock-controlled transcription per <dig>  cry <dig> and cry <dig> differ in their capacity to interact with each single component of the bmal1-clock heterodimer and, in the case of bmal <dig>  also in their interaction sites. our data supports the hypothesis that cry proteins, especially cry <dig>  are stronger repressors than per proteins.
