BACKGROUND
cloud computing provides an infrastructure that facilitates large scale computational analysis in a scalable, democratized fashion, however, in this context it is difficult to ensure sharing of an analysis environment and associated data in a scalable and precisely reproducible way.


RESULTS
cloudman  enables individual researchers to easily deploy, customize, and share their entire cloud analysis environment, including data, tools, and configurations.


CONCLUSIONS
with the enabled customization and sharing of instances, cloudman can be used as a platform for collaboration. the presented solution improves accessibility of cloud resources, tools, and data to the level of an individual researcher and contributes toward reproducibility and transparency of research solutions.
