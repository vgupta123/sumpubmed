BACKGROUND
when compared to primary chicken embryo fibroblast  cells, the immortal df- <dig> cef line exhibits enhanced growth rates and susceptibility to oxidative stress. although genes responsible for cell cycle regulation and antioxidant functions have been identified, the genome-wide transcription profile of immortal df- <dig> cef cells has not been previously reported. global gene expression in primary cef and df- <dig> cells was performed using a 4x44k chicken oligo microarray.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified with a  <dig> fold level cutoff that included  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes in df- <dig> cells. network and functional analyses using ingenuity pathways analysis  revealed that  <dig> of  <dig> differentially expressed genes were classified into a number of functional groups including cellular growth and proliferation, cell cycle, cellular movement, cancer, genetic disorders, and cell death. also, the top  <dig> gene networks with intermolecular connections were identified. bioinformatic analyses suggested that df- <dig> cells were characterized by enhanced molecular mechanisms for cell cycle progression and proliferation, suppressing cell death pathways, altered cellular morphogenesis, and accelerated capacity for molecule transport. key molecules for these functions include e2f <dig>  brca <dig>  src, casp <dig>  and the peroxidases.


CONCLUSIONS
the global gene expression profiles provide insight into the cellular mechanisms that regulate the unique characteristics observed in immortal df- <dig> cef cells.
