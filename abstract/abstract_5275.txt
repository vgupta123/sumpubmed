BACKGROUND
association analysis is an alternative way for qtl mapping in ryegrass. so far, knowledge on nucleotide diversity and linkage disequilibrium in ryegrass is lacking, which is essential for the efficiency of association analyses.


RESULTS
 <dig> expressed disease resistance candidate  genes including  <dig> nucleotide binding site and leucine rich repeat  like genes and  <dig> non-nbs-lrr genes were analyzed for nucleotide diversity. for each of the genes about  <dig> kb genomic fragments were isolated from  <dig> heterozygous genotypes in ryegrass. the number of haplotypes per gene ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  on average, one single nucleotide polymorphism  was present per  <dig> bp between two randomly sampled sequences for the  <dig> genes. nbs-lrr like gene fragments showed a high degree of nucleotide diversity, with one snp every  <dig> bp between two randomly sampled sequences. nbs-lrr like gene fragments showed very high non-synonymous mutation rates, leading to altered amino acid sequences. particularly lrr regions showed very high diversity with on average one snp every  <dig> bp between two sequences. in contrast, non-nbs lrr resistance candidate genes showed a lower degree of nucleotide diversity, with one snp every  <dig> bp. 78% of haplotypes occurred at low frequency  within the collection of  <dig> genotypes. low intragenic ld was detected for most r genes, and rapid ld decay within  <dig> bp was detected.


CONCLUSIONS
substantial ld decay was found within a distance of  <dig> bp for most resistance candidate genes in this study. hence, ld based association analysis is feasible and promising for qtl fine mapping of resistance traits in ryegrass.
