BACKGROUND
p300/cbp associating factor  is a catalytic subunit of megadalton metazoan complex atac  for acetylation of histones. however, relatively little is known about the regulation of the enzymatic activity of pcaf.


RESULTS
here we present two dimeric structures of the pcaf acetyltransferase  domain. these dimerizations are mediated by either four-helical hydrophobic interactions or a ÃŸ-sheet extension. our chemical cross-linking experiments in combined with site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the pcaf hat domain mainly forms a dimer in solution through one of the observed interfaces. the results of maltose binding protein -pulldown, co-immunoprecipitation and multiangle static light scattering experiments further indicated that pcaf dimeric state is detectable and may possibly exist in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our structural and biochemical studies indicate that pcaf appears to be a dimer in its functional atac complex.
