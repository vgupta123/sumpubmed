BACKGROUND
kernel-based classification is the current state-of-the-art for extracting pairs of interacting proteins  from free text. various proposals have been put forward, which diverge especially in the specific kernel function, the type of input representation, and the feature sets. these proposals are regularly compared to each other regarding their overall performance on different gold standard corpora, but little is known about their respective performance on the instance level.


RESULTS
we report on a detailed analysis of the shared characteristics and the differences between  <dig> current methods using five ppi corpora. we identified a large number of rather difficult  and easy  ppis. we show that kernels using the same input representation perform similarly on these pairs and that building ensembles using dissimilar kernels leads to significant performance gain. however, our analysis also reveals that characteristics shared between difficult pairs are few, which lowers the hope that new methods, if built along the same line as current ones, will deliver breakthroughs in extraction performance.


CONCLUSIONS
our experiments show that current methods do not seem to do very well in capturing the shared characteristics of positive ppi pairs, which must also be attributed to the heterogeneity of the  available corpora. our analysis suggests that performance improvements shall be sought after rather in novel feature sets than in novel kernel functions.
