BACKGROUND
renal injury of anti-glomerular basement membrane  disease is defined by the linear deposition of igg along gbm and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. to date, the distribution of anti-gbm igg subclasses on renal tissue is still unclear. in the current study, we investigated the deposition of the four igg subclasses using immunohistochemistry in the renal biopsy specimens from  <dig> patients with anti-gbm disease.


RESULTS
all four igg subclasses can be detected within the gbm. anti-gbm igg <dig> was detected in all patients , with  <dig>  patients presenting with weak segmental staining and  <dig>  patients with strong linear deposition. anti-gbm igg <dig> was detected in  <dig>  patients, with  <dig>  patients having weak segmental deposition and  <dig>  patients presenting strong linear staining. anti-gbm igg <dig> and igg <dig> were detected in  <dig>  and  <dig>  patients, respectively. igg deposition along tubular basement membrane  was also detected in  <dig>  patients. among them, the igg subclass distribution was similar to that of the deposition within the gbm: igg <dig>  <dig> % , igg <dig>  <dig> % , igg <dig> 100%  and igg <dig>  <dig> % . we observed increased inflammatory cell infiltration into the interstitium in patients with increased anti-tbm igg <dig> deposits .


CONCLUSIONS
anti-gbm igg <dig> predominantly deposits along gbm and tbm on renal biopsy specimens from patients with anti-gbm disease, which may be involved in the development of renal injury of the disease.
