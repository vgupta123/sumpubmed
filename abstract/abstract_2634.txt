BACKGROUND
the adhesion of lactobacilli to the vaginal surface is of paramount importance to develop their probiotic functions. for this reason, the role of hela cell surface proteoglycans in the attachment of lactobacillus salivarius lv <dig>  a mutualistic strain of vaginal origin, was investigated.


RESULTS
incubation of cultures with a variety of glycosaminoglycans  resulted in marked binding interference. however, no single glycosaminoglycan was able to completely abolish cell binding, the sum of all having an additive effect that suggests cooperation between them and recognition of specific adhesins on the bacterial surface. in contrast, chondroitin sulfate b enhanced cell to cell attachment, showing the relevance of the stereochemistry of the uronic acid and the sulfation pattern on binding. elimination of the hela surface glycosaminoglycans with lyases also resulted in severe adherence impairment. advantage was taken of the lactobacillus-glycosaminoglycans interaction to identify an adhesin from the bacterial surface. this protein, identify as a soluble binding protein of an abc transporter system  by maldi-tof/, was overproduced in escherichia coli, purified and shown to interfere with l. salivarius lv <dig> adhesion to hela cells.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that glycosaminoglycans play a fundamental role in attachment of mutualistic bacteria to the epithelium that lines the cavities where the normal microbiota thrives, oppa being a bacterial adhesin involved in the process.
