BACKGROUND
increasing use of zebrafish in drug discovery and mechanistic toxicology demands knowledge of cytochrome p <dig>  gene regulation and function. cyp enzymes catalyze oxidative transformation leading to activation or inactivation of many endogenous and exogenous chemicals, with consequences for normal physiology and disease processes. many cyps potentially have roles in developmental specification, and many chemicals that cause developmental abnormalities are substrates for cyps. here we identify and annotate the full suite of cyp genes in zebrafish, compare these to the human cyp gene complement, and determine the expression of cyp genes during normal development.


RESULTS
zebrafish have a total of  <dig> cyp genes, distributed among  <dig> gene families found also in mammals. there are  <dig> genes in cyp families  <dig> to  <dig>  most of which are direct orthologs of human cyps that are involved in endogenous functions including synthesis or inactivation of regulatory molecules. the high degree of sequence similarity suggests conservation of enzyme activities for these cyps, confirmed in reports for some steroidogenic enzymes , and the cyp <dig> retinoic acid hydroxylases. complexity is much greater in gene families  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which include cyps prominent in metabolism of drugs and pollutants, as well as of endogenous substrates. there are orthologous relationships for some cyp <dig> s and some cyp <dig> s between zebrafish and human. in contrast, zebrafish have  <dig> cyp <dig> genes, compared to  <dig> in human, with only two  recognized as orthologous based on sequence. analysis of shared synteny identified cyp <dig> gene clusters evolutionarily related to mammalian cyp <dig> s, as well as unique clusters.


CONCLUSIONS
transcript profiling by microarray and quantitative pcr revealed that the majority of zebrafish cyp genes are expressed in embryos, with waves of expression of different sets of genes over the course of development. transcripts of some cyp occur also in oocytes. the results provide a foundation for the use of zebrafish as a model in toxicological, pharmacological and chemical disease research.
