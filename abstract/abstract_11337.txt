BACKGROUND
proteins are able to react in response to distinct stress stimuli by alteration of their subcellular distribution. the stress-responsive protein s100a <dig> belongs to the family of multifunctional s <dig> proteins which have been implicated in several key biological processes. previously, we have shown that s100a <dig> is directly involved in dna repair processes at damaged chromatin in the nucleus. to gain further insight into the underlying mechanism subcellular trafficking of s100a <dig> in response to dna damage was analyzed.


RESULTS
we show that dna damage induces a nucleolin-mediated translocation of s100a <dig> from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. this translocation is impeded by inhibition of the phosphorylation activity of pkcÎ±. translocation of s100a <dig> into the nucleus correlates with an increased cellular p <dig> protein level. depletion of nucleolin by sirna severely impairs translocation of s100a <dig> into the nucleus resulting in a decreased p <dig> protein level. additionally, cells lacking nucleolin showed a reduced colony forming capacity.


CONCLUSIONS
these observations suggest that regulation of the subcellular distribution of s100a <dig> plays an important role in the dna damage response and p21-mediated cell cycle control.
