BACKGROUND
to develop antibacterial agents having novel modes of action against bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, we targeted the essential murf enzyme of the antibiotic resistant pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa. murf catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between d-alanyl-d-alanine  and the cell wall precursor uridine 5'-diphosphoryl n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid  with the concomitant hydrolysis of atp to adp and inorganic phosphate, yielding udp-n-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide. as murf acts on a dipeptide, we exploited a phage display approach to identify peptide ligands having high binding affinities for the enzyme.


RESULTS
screening of a phage display 12-mer library using purified p. aeruginosa murf yielded to the identification of the murfp <dig> peptide. the murf substrate udp-murnac-ala-glumeso-a2pm was synthesized and used to develop a sensitive spectrophotometric assay to quantify murf kinetics and inhibition. murfp <dig> acted as a weak, time-dependent inhibitor of murf activity but was a potent inhibitor when murf was pre-incubated with udp-murnac-ala-glu-meso-a2pm or atp. in contrast, adding the substrate d-ala-d-ala during the pre-incubation nullified the inhibition. the ic <dig> value of murfp <dig> was evaluated at  <dig> μm, and the ki was established at  <dig> μm with respect to the mixed type of inhibition against d-ala-d-ala.


CONCLUSIONS
murfp <dig> exerts its inhibitory action by interfering with the utilization of d-ala-d-ala by the murf amide ligase enzyme. we propose that murfp <dig> exploits udp-murnac-ala-glu-meso-a2pm-induced structural changes for better interaction with the enzyme. we present the first peptide inhibitor of murf, an enzyme that should be exploited as a target for antimicrobial drug development.
