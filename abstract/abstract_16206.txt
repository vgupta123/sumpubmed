BACKGROUND
the university of california, santa cruz  genome database is among the most used sources of genomic annotation in human and other organisms. the database offers an excellent web-based graphical user interface  and several means for programmatic queries. a simple application programming interface  in a scripting language aimed at the biologist was however not yet available. here, we present the ruby ucsc api, a library to access the ucsc genome database using ruby.


RESULTS
the api is designed as a bioruby plug-in and built on the activerecord  <dig> framework for the object-relational mapping, making writing sql statements unnecessary. the current version of the api supports databases of all organisms in the ucsc genome database including human, mammals, vertebrates, deuterostomes, insects, nematodes, and yeast.

the api uses the bin index—if available—when querying for genomic intervals. the api also supports genomic sequence queries using locally downloaded *.2bit files that are not stored in the official mysql database. the api is implemented in pure ruby and is therefore available in different environments and with different ruby interpreters .


CONCLUSIONS
assisted by the straightforward object-oriented design of ruby and activerecord, the ruby ucsc api will facilitate biologists to query the ucsc genome database programmatically. the api is available through the rubygem system. source code and documentation are available at https://github.com/misshie/bioruby-ucsc-api/ under the ruby license. feedback and help is provided via the website at http://rubyucscapi.userecho.com/.
