BACKGROUND
erythroid nuclear cells  of the bone marrow  have not previously been considered as important producers of wide spectrum of haemo- and immunoregulatory cytokines. the aim of the current work was to confirm the production of the main hemo- and immunoregulatory cytokines in human enc from bm.


RESULTS
we used native human bm enc in our experiments. we for the first time have shown, that the unstimulated erythroblasts  produced a wide spectrum of immunoregulatory cytokines. human bm enc produce cytokines such as interleukn -1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  interferon -γ, transforming growth factor -β <dig>  tumor necrosis factor -α and il- <dig>  they can be sub-divided into glycophorin a positive  and erythroblast antigen positive  cells. to study potential differences in cytokine expression between these subsets, enc were isolated and purified using specific antibodies to gl a and ag-eb and the separated cells were cultivated for  <dig> hours. the cytokine contents of the supernatant were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. quantitative differences in tgf-β <dig> and tnf-α production were found between gl a+ and ag-eb+ bm enc. furthermore, in vitro addition of erythropoietin  reduced ifn-γ and il- <dig> production specifically by the ag-eb+ enc. thus, gl a+ and ag-eb+ enc produce il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifn-γ, tgf-β <dig> and tnf-α. gl a+ enc also produce il- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
cytokine production by erythroid nuclear cells suggests that these cells might be involved in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic and immunocompetent cells in human bm.
