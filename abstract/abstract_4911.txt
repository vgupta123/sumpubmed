BACKGROUND
since  <dig>  large-scale streptococcus agalactiae infections have broken out in cultured tilapia farms in china, resulting in considerable economic losses. screening of the surface proteins is required to identify virulence factors or protective antigens involved in piscine s.agalactiae infections in tilapia. pre-absorbed immunoproteomics method  is a useful method previously established in our laboratory for identifying bacterial surface proteins.


RESULTS
a serine-rich repeat protein family  <dig> , designated xf, was identified by paim in piscine s. agalactiae isolate gd201008- <dig>  to investigate the role of xf in the pathogenesis of piscine s. agalactiae, an isogenic xf mutant strain  and a complemented strain  were successfully constructed. the Δxf mutant and cΔxf showed no significant differences in growth characteristics and adherence to hep- <dig> cells compared with the wild-type strain. however the 50% lethal dose of Δxf was increased  compared with that of the parental strain in a zebrafish infection model.


CONCLUSIONS
the findings demonstrated that xf is a virulence-related, highly immunoreactive surface protein and is involved in the pathogenicity of s. agalactiae infections in fish.
