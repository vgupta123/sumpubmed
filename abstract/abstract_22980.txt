BACKGROUND
the glomerular podocyte is a highly specialized cell type with the ability to ultrafilter blood and support glomerular capillary pressure. however, little is known about the genetic programs leading to this functionality or the final phenotype.


RESULTS
in the current study, we found that the expression of a myocardin/mkl family member, mkl <dig>  was significantly upregulated during cell cycle arrest induced by a temperature switch in murine podocyte clone  <dig>  cells. further investigation demonstrated that overexpression of mkl <dig> led to inhibition of cell proliferation by decreasing the number of cells in s phase of the cell cycle. in contrast, mkl <dig> knockdown by rna interference had the opposite effect, highlighting a potential role of mkl <dig> in blocking g1/s transition of the cell cycle in mpc <dig> cells. additionally, using an rt <dig> profiler pcr array, p <dig> was identified as a direct target of mkl <dig>  we further revealed that mkl <dig> activated p <dig> transcription by recruitment to the carg element in its promoter, thus resulting in cell cycle arrest. in addition, the expression of mkl <dig> is positively correlated with that of p <dig> in podocytes in postnatal mouse kidney and significantly upregulated during the morphological switch of podocytes from proliferation to differentiation.


CONCLUSIONS
our observations demonstrate that mkl <dig> has physiological roles in the maturation and development of podocytes, and thus its misregulation might lead to glomerular and renal dysfunction.
