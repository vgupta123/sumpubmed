BACKGROUND
for the representation of rna interference  dynamics, several mathematical models based on systems of ordinary differential equations  have been proposed. these models consist of equations for each molecule that are involved in rnai phenomena. therefore, many real-value parameters must be optimized to identify the models. they also have many ‘hidden variables’, which cannot be observed directly through experimentation. calculation of the values of the hidden variables is generally very difficult, if not impossible in some special cases. identification of the ode models is also quite difficult.


RESULTS
we show that the simplified logistic lotka–volterra model, a well-established ode model for biological and biochemical phenomena, can represent rnai dynamics as a predator–prey system. although a hidden variable exists in the model, its values can be determined and made visible as dynamic profiles of rna-decomposing effects of sirnas. correlation analysis shows that the model parameters correlate highly with the total effect of the sirna.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that analyses using our model are useful to estimate dynamic profiles of sirna effects on apoptosis and to score sirna by its effects on apoptosis, namely ‘phenotypic scoring’.
