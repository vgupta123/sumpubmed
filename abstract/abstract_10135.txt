BACKGROUND
hiv-infected long-term non-progressor  subjects can prevent viral replication and may harbor useful information for the development of both antibody and active vaccination treatments. in this study we used ltnp sera to examine the epitopes presented to the gp <dig> protein, and from this procedure we hope to elucidate potential biomarkers pertaining to the level of resistance a patient may have in developing aids after infection with hiv. we used five clinical sera samples from ltnp patients to identify common epitopes by elisa; peptides with high binding to sera were selected and analyzed for conservation among hiv clades. antibodies were generated against one identified epitope using a chimeric peptide in balb/c mice, and both the sera from these mice and ltnp sera were tested for viral inhibition capabilities.


RESULTS
a monoclonal antibody, cl <dig>  against one identified epitope was used to compare these epitopes neutralizing capability. ltnp sera was also studied to determine chemokine/cytokine changes in these patients. the sera from ltnp patients  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were identified as having the highest titers, and also significantly inhibited syncytia formation in vitro. finally, the protein cytokine array demonstrated that i- <dig> and igfbp- <dig> decreased in ltnps, but levels of timp- <dig> and nap- <dig> increased significantly.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the use of ltnp samples may be a useful for identifying further anti-viral epitopes, and may be a possible predictor for determining if patients show higher resistances of converting the hiv infection to aids.
