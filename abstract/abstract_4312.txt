BACKGROUND
diacylglycerol kinase  is an enzyme that phosphorylates diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid and comprises multiple isozymes of distinct properties. of dgks, mrna signal for dgkβ is strongly detected in the striatum, and one of the transcripts derived from the human dgkβ locus is annotated in genbank as being differentially expressed in bipolar disorder patients. recently, we have reported that dgkβ is expressed in medium spiny neurons of the striatum and is highly concentrated at the perisynapse of dendritic spines. however, it remains elusive how dgkβ is implicated in pathophysiological role in neurons at the cellular level.


RESULTS
in the present study, we investigated the expression and subcellular localization of dgkβ in the hippocampus, together with its functional implication using transfected hippocampal neurons. dgkβ is expressed not only in projection neurons but also in interneurons and is concentrated at perisynaptic sites of asymmetrical synapses. overexpression of wild-type dgkβ promotes dendrite outgrowth at  <dig> d in vitro  and spine maturation at  <dig> div in transfected hippocampal neurons, although its kinase-dead mutant has no effect.


CONCLUSIONS
in the hippocampus, dgkβ is expressed in both projection neurons and interneurons and is accumulated at the perisynapse of dendritic spines in asymmetrical synapses. transfection experiments suggest that dgkβ may be involved in the molecular machineries of dendrite outgrowth and spinogenesis through its kinase activity.
