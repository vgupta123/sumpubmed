BACKGROUND
glv-1h <dig> is an attenuated recombinant vaccinia virus  that selectively colonizes established human xenografts inducing their complete regression.


RESULTS
here, we explored xenograft/vacv/host interactions in vivo adopting organism-specific expression arrays and tumor cell/vacv in vitro comparing vacv replication patterns. there were no clear-cut differences in vitro among responding and non-responding tumors, however, tumor rejection was associated in vivo with activation of interferon-stimulated genes  and innate immune host's effector functions  correlating with vacv colonization of the xenografts. these signatures precisely reproduce those observed in humans during immune-mediated tissue-specific destruction  that causes tumor or allograft rejection, autoimmunity or clearance of pathogens. we recently defined these common pathways in the "immunologic constant of rejection" hypothesis .


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides the first prospective validation of a universal mechanism associated with tsd. thus, xenograft infection by oncolytic vacv, beyond offering a promising therapy of established cancers, may represent a reliable pre-clinical model to test therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the central pathways leading to tsd; this information may lead to the identification of principles that could refine the treatment of cancer and chronic infection by immune stimulation or autoimmunity and allograft rejection through immune tolerance.
