BACKGROUND
candida albicans infections are often associated with biofilm formation. previous work demonstrated that the expression of hwp <dig>  and of genes belonging to the als , sap , plb  and lip  gene families is associated with biofilm growth on mucosal surfaces. we investigated using real-time pcr whether genes encoding potential virulence factors are also highly expressed in biofilms associated with abiotic surfaces. for this, c. albicans biofilms were grown on silicone in microtiter plates  or in the centres for disease control  reactor, on polyurethane in an in vivo subcutaneous catheter rat  model, and on mucosal surfaces in the reconstituted human epithelium  model.


RESULTS
hwp <dig> and genes belonging to the als, sap, plb and lip gene families were constitutively expressed in c. albicans biofilms. als1- <dig> were upregulated in all model systems, while als <dig> was mostly downregulated. als <dig> and hwp <dig> were overexpressed in all models except in the rhe and mtp, respectively. the expression levels of sap <dig> were more pronounced in both in vitro models, while those of sap <dig>  sap <dig> and sap <dig> were higher in the in vivo model. furthermore, sap <dig> was highly upregulated in the in vivo and rhe models. for sap <dig> and sap <dig> similar gene expression levels were observed in all model systems. plb genes were not considerably upregulated in biofilms, while lip1- <dig>  lip5- <dig> and lip9- <dig> were highly overexpressed in both in vitro models. furthermore, an elevated lipase activity was detected in supernatans of biofilms grown in the mtp and rhe model.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings show that hwp <dig> and most of the genes belonging to the als, sap and lip gene families are upregulated in c. albicans biofilms. comparison of the fold expression between the various model systems revealed similar expression levels for some genes, while for others model-dependent expression levels were observed. this suggests that data obtained in one biofilm model cannot be extrapolated to other model systems. therefore, the need to use multiple model systems when studying the expression of genes encoding potential virulence factors in c. albicans biofilms is highlighted.
