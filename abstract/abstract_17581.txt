BACKGROUND
l-ornithine , is an intermediate metabolite in the urea cycle that plays a significant role in humans. l-orn can be obtained from the catalysis of l-arginine  by arginase. the pichia pastoris expression system offers the possibility of generating a large amount of recombinant protein. the immobilized enzyme technology can overcome the difficulties in recovery, recycling and long-term stability that result from the use of free enzyme.

methods
the recombinant human arginase i  was obtained using an optimized method with the pichia pastoris gs <dig> as the host strain. chitosan paticles were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde and rinsed exhaustively. then the expressed arg i was immobilized on the crosslinked chitosan particles, and the enzymatic properties of both the free and immobilized enzymes were evaluated. at last, the immobilized arg i was employed to catalyze l-arg to l-orn.


RESULTS
the results indicated that these two states both exhibited optimal activity under the same condition of ph <dig> at 40 °c. however, the immobilized arg i exhibited the remarkable thermal and long-term stability as well as broad adaptability to ph, suggesting its potential for wide application in future industry. after a careful analysis of its catalytic conditions, immobilized arg i was employed to catalyze the conversion of l-arg to l-orn under optimal condition of 1 % glutaraldehyde, 1 mm mn2+, 40 °c, ph <dig> and an l-arginine  concentration of 200 g/l, achieving a highly converted content of  <dig> g/l l-orn.


CONCLUSIONS
in this work, arg Ι was abundantly expressed, and an efficient, facile and repeatable method was developed to synthesize high-quality l-orn. this method not only solved the problem of obtaining a large amount of arginase, but also provided a promising alternative for the future industrial production of l-orn.
