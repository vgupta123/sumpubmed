BACKGROUND
phenylobacterium zucineum is a recently identified facultative intracellular species isolated from the human leukemia cell line k <dig>  unlike the known intracellular pathogens, p. zucineum maintains a stable association with its host cell without affecting the growth and morphology of the latter.


RESULTS
here, we report the whole genome sequence of the type strain hlk1t. the genome consists of a circular chromosome  and a circular plasmid . it encodes  <dig>  putative proteins,  <dig> trnas, and a 16s-23s-5s rrna operon. comparative genomic analysis revealed that it is phylogenetically closest to caulobacter crescentus, a model species for cell cycle research. notably, p. zucineum has a gene that is strikingly similar, both structurally and functionally, to the cell cycle master regulator ctra of c. crescentus, and most of the genes directly regulated by ctra in the latter have orthologs in the former.


CONCLUSIONS
this work presents the first complete bacterial genome in the genus phenylobacterium. comparative genomic analysis indicated that the ctra regulon is well conserved between c. crescentus and p. zucineum.
