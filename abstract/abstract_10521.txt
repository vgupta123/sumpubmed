BACKGROUND
benzimidazole  resistance in gastrointestinal nematodes is associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism  at codons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the isotype  <dig> of beta-tubulin gene although in some species these snps have also been associated with resistance to macrocyclic lactones. in the present study we compared the levels of resistance in teladorsagia circumcincta and trichostrongylus colubriformis by means of the faecal egg reduction test  and the percentage of resistant alleles obtained after pyrosequencing. the study was conducted in  <dig> naturally infected sheep flocks. each flock was divided into three groups: i) group treated with albendazole ; ii) group treated with ivermectin ; iii) untreated group. the number of eggs excreted per gram of faeces was estimated at day  <dig> and  <dig> post-treatment.


RESULTS
resistance to abz was observed in  <dig> %  of the flocks and to ivm in  <dig> %  of them. one flock was resistant to both drugs according to fecrt. coprocultures were performed at the same dates to collect l <dig> for dna extraction from pooled larvae and to determine the resistant allele frequencies by pyrosequencing analysis. in t. circumcincta, snps were not found at any of the three codons before treatment; after the administration of abz, snps were present only in two different flocks, one of them with a frequency of  <dig> % at snp  <dig>  and the other  <dig> % % at snp  <dig>  in relation to t. colubriformis, we found the snp <dig> before treatment in  <dig> %  of the flocks with values between  <dig>  and  <dig> %. after treatment with abz and ivm, the prevalence of this snp increased to  <dig> and 100% of the flocks, with a mean frequency of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the frequencies observed for snp <dig> in t. colubriformis indicate that the presence of resistance is more common than revealed by the fecrt.
