BACKGROUND

paenibacillus polymyxa is a plant-growth promoting rhizobacterium that could be exploited as an environmentally friendlier alternative to chemical fertilizers and pesticides. various strains have been isolated that can benefit agriculture through antimicrobial activity, nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, plant hormone production, or lignocellulose degradation. however, no single strain has yet been identified in which all of these advantageous traits have been confirmed.


RESULTS

p. polymyxa cr <dig> was isolated from degrading corn roots from southern ontario, canada. it was shown to possess in vitro antagonistic activities against the common plant pathogens phytophthora sojae p <dig> , rhizoctonia solani  <dig> , cylindrocarpon destructans  <dig> , pseudomonas syringae dc <dig> , and xanthomonas campestris 93- <dig> , as well as bacillus cereus , an agent of food-borne illness. p. polymyxa cr <dig> enhanced growth of maize, potato, cucumber, arabidopsis, and tomato plants; utilized atmospheric nitrogen and insoluble phosphorus; produced the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid ; and degraded and utilized the major components of lignocellulose .


CONCLUSIONS

p. polymyxa cr <dig> has multiple beneficial traits that are relevant to sustainable agriculture and the bio-economy. this strain could be developed for field application in order to control pathogens, promote plant growth, and degrade crop residues after harvest.
