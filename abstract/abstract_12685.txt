BACKGROUND
genome sequencing of barley has been delayed due to its large genome size . among the fast sequencing systems,  <dig> liquid phase pyrosequencing provides the longest reads and is the most promising method for bac clones. here we report the results of pooled sequencing of bac clones selected with ests genetically mapped to chromosome 3h.


RESULTS
we sequenced pooled barley bac clones using a  <dig> parallel genome sequencer. a pcr screening system based on primer sets derived from genetically mapped ests on chromosome 3h was used for clone selection in a bac library developed from cultivar "haruna nijo". the dna samples of  <dig> or  <dig> bac clones were pooled and used for shotgun library development. the homology between contig sequences generated in each pooled library and mapped est sequences was studied. the number of contigs assigned on chromosome 3h was  <dig>  their lengths ranged from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp with an average  <dig>  bp. of these contigs,  <dig> showed homology and colinearity with the genome sequence of rice chromosome  <dig>  a contig annotation browser supplemented with query search by unique sequence or genetic map position was developed. the identified contigs can be annotated with barley cdnas and reference sequences on the browser. homology analysis of these contigs with rice genes indicated that  <dig>  rice genes can be assigned to barley contigs by the simple comparison of sequence lengths in both species. of these genes,  <dig> are assigned to rice chromosome  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate the efficiency of sequencing gene rich regions from barley chromosome 3h, with special reference to syntenic relationships with rice chromosome  <dig>
