BACKGROUND
most hiv-infected subjects exhibit a progressive rise in cd <dig> t-cell counts after initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy . however, a subset of individuals exhibit very poor cd <dig> t-cell recovery despite effective control of hiv-rna viraemia. we evaluated cd <dig> t-cell proliferation among suboptimal responders and its correlation with cd <dig> t-cell activation.

methods
the magnitude of cd <dig> increase  was grouped into  <dig> quartiles for the  <dig> patients with sustained hiv-rna viral suppression. cases of ‘suboptimal immune responders’ included patients within the lowest quartile  and a comparison group of ‘optimal immune responders’ was defined as patients within the highest quartile of cd <dig> increase . frozen pbmc were thawed and analysed from a convenient sample of  <dig> suboptimal responders and  <dig> optimal responders after  <dig> years of suppressive antiretroviral therapy. t-cell activation was measured by proportions of t-cells expressing surface marker cd <dig> and hladr . t-cell proliferation was determined by the extent of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester  dye dilution on culture day  <dig> of pbmcs in the presence of antigen . samples were analyzed on a facs calibur flow cytometer and flow data was analyzed using flowjo and graphpad.


RESULTS
overall, cd <dig> t-cell proliferation on stimulation with seb, ppd, cmvpp <dig>  gag a and gag d.antigens, was lower among suboptimal than optimal responders; this was significant for seb  and ppd antigens . among suboptimal responders, t-cell proliferation decreased with increasing immune activation  but not among optimal responders.


CONCLUSIONS
t-cell immune activation and exhaustion were associated with poor proliferation among suboptimal responders to haart despite sustained viral suppression. we recommend studies to further understand the mechanisms leading to impaired t-cell function among suboptimal responders as well as the potential role of immune modulation in optimizing cd <dig> count and functional recovery after haart.
