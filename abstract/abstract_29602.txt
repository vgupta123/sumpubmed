BACKGROUND
senescent cells are well-recognized in the aging/degenerating human disc. senescent cells are viable, cannot divide, remain metabolically active and accumulate within the disc over time. molecular analysis of senescent cells in tissue offers a special challenge since there are no cell surface markers for senescence which would let one use fluorescence-activated cell sorting as a method for separating out senescent cells.

methods
we employed a novel laser capture microdissection  design to selectively harvest senescent and non-senescent annulus cells in paraffin-embedded tissue, and compared their gene expression with microarray analysis. lcm was used to separately harvest senescent and non-senescent cells from  <dig> human annulus specimens.


RESULTS
microarray analysis revealed significant differences in expression levels in senescent cells vs non-senescent cells:  <dig> genes were upregulated, and  <dig> downregulated. genes with established relationships to senescence were found to be significantly upregulated in senescent cells vs. non-senescent cells: p <dig> , rb-associated krab zinc finger, discoidin, cub and lccl domain, growth arrest and dna-damage inducible beta, p28ing <dig>  sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor  <dig> and somatostatin receptor 3; cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig> showed significant downregulation in senescent cells. nitric oxidase synthase  <dig>  and heat shock  <dig> kda protein  <dig>  both of which were significantly down-regulated in senescent cells, also showed significant changes. additional genes related to cytokines, cell proliferation, and other processes were also identified.


CONCLUSIONS
our lcm-microarray analyses identified a set of genes associated with senescence which were significantly upregulated in senescent vs non-senescent cells in the human annulus. these genes include p <dig> map kinase, discoidin, inhibitor of growth family member  <dig>  and growth arrest and dna-damage-inducible beta. other genes, including genes associated with cell proliferation, extracellular matrix formation, cell signaling and other cell functions also showed significant modulation in senescent vs non-senescent cells. the aging/degenerating disc undergoes a well-recognized loss of cells; understanding senescent cells is important since their presence further reduces the disc's ability to generate new cells to replace those lost to necrosis or apoptosis.
