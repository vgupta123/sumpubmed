BACKGROUND
cigarette smoking enhances the risk of stroke. however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. the present study established an in vivo rat secondhand cigarette smoking  model and examined the hypothesis that shs upregulates endothelin receptors with increased cerebrovascular contraction via the raf/extracellular signal-regulated kinase /mitogen-activated protein kinases  pathway.


RESULTS
rats were exposed to shs for up to  <dig> weeks. the cerebral artery vasoconstriction was recorded by a sensitive myograph. the mrna and protein expressions for endothelin receptors in cerebral arteries were studied by real-time pcr and western blot. compared to fresh air exposed rats, cerebral arteries from shs rats exhibited stronger contractile responses  mediated by endothelin type a  receptors. the expressions of mrna and protein for eta receptors in the cerebral arteries from shs rats were higher  than that in control. shs did not affect endothelin type b  receptor-mediated contractions, mrna or protein levels. the results suggest that shs upregulates eta, but not etb receptors in vivo. after shs exposure, the mrna levels of raf- <dig> and erk1/ <dig>  the protein expression of phosphorylated -raf- <dig> and p-erk1/ <dig> were increased . raf- <dig> inhibitor, gw <dig> suppressed the enhanced eta receptor-mediated contraction, mrna and protein levels induced by shs. in addition, gw <dig> inhibited the shs-caused increased mrna and phosphorylated protein levels of raf- <dig> and erk1/ <dig>  suggesting that shs induces activation of the raf/erk/mapk pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
shs upregulates cerebrovascular eta receptors via the raf/erk/mapk pathway, which provides novel understanding of mechanisms involved in shs-associated stroke.
