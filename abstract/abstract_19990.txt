BACKGROUND
fk <dig>  is an important immunosuppressant, produced by industrial biosynthetic processes using various streptomyces species. considering the complex structure of fk <dig>  it is reasonable to expect complex regulatory networks controlling its biosynthesis. regulatory elements, present in gene clusters can have a profound influence on the final yield of target product and can play an important role in development of industrial bioprocesses.


RESULTS
three putative regulatory elements, namely fkbr, belonging to the lysr-type family, fkbn, a large atp-binding regulator of the luxr family  and alln, a homologue of asnc family regulatory proteins, were identified in the fk <dig> gene cluster from streptomyces tsukubaensis nrrl  <dig>  a progenitor of industrial strains used for production of fk <dig>  inactivation of fkbn caused a complete disruption of fk <dig> biosynthesis, while inactivation of fkbr resulted in about 80% reduction of fk <dig> yield. no functional role in the regulation of the fk <dig> gene cluster has been observed for the alln gene. using rt-pcr and a reporter system based on a chalcone synthase rppa, we demonstrated, that in the wild type as well as in fkbn- and fkbr-inactivated strains, fkbr is transcribed in all stages of cultivation, even before the onset of fk <dig> production, whereas fkbn expression is initiated approximately with the initiation of fk <dig> production. surprisingly, inactivation of fkbn  does not abolish the transcription of the genes in the fk <dig> gene cluster in general, but may reduce expression of some of the tested biosynthetic genes. finally, introduction of a second copy of the fkbr or fkbn genes under the control of the strong erme* promoter into the wild type strain resulted in 30% and 55% of yield improvement, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
our results clearly demonstrate the positive regulatory role of fkbr and fkbn genes in fk <dig> biosynthesis in s. tsukubaensis nrrl  <dig>  we have shown that regulatory mechanisms can differ substantially from other, even apparently closely similar fk506-producing strains, reported in literature. finally, we have demonstrated the potential of these genetically modified strains of s. tsukubaensis for improving the yield of fermentative processes for production of fk <dig>
