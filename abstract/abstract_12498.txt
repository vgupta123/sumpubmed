BACKGROUND
while dendritic cells  can induce tolerance in t cells, little is known about tolerance induction in dcs themselves. we have analysed tolerance induced in human in-vitro generated dcs by repeated stimulation with ligands for tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> 


RESULTS
dcs stimulated with the tlr <dig> ligand lps did show a rapid and pronounced expression of tnf mrna and protein. when dcs were pre-cultured for  <dig> days with  <dig> ng lps/ml then the subsequent response to stimulation with a high dose of lps  was strongly reduced for both tnf mrna and protein. at the promoter level there was a reduced transactivation by the - <dig> bp tnf promoter and by a construct with a tetrameric nf-κb motif. within the signalling cascade leading to nf-κb activation we found an ablation of the irak- <dig> adaptor protein in lps-tolerant dcs. pre-culture of dcs with the tlr <dig> ligand pam3cys also led to tolerance with respect to tnf gene expression and irak- <dig> protein was ablated in such tolerant cells as well, while irak- <dig> protein levels were unchanged.


CONCLUSIONS
these data show that tlr-ligands can render dcs tolerant with respect to tnf gene expression by a mechanism that likely involves blockade of signal transduction at the level of irak- <dig>
