BACKGROUND
the problem of de-novo assembly for metagenomes using only long reads is gaining attention. we study whether post-processing metagenomic assemblies with the original input long reads can result in quality improvement. previous approaches have focused on pre-processing reads and optimizing assemblers. bigmac takes an alternative perspective to focus on the post-processing step.


RESULTS
using both the assembled contigs and original long reads as input, bigmac first breaks the contigs at potentially mis-assembled locations and subsequently scaffolds contigs. our experiments on metagenomes assembled from long reads show that bigmac can improve assembly quality by reducing the number of mis-assemblies while maintaining or increasing n <dig> and n <dig>  moreover, bigmac shows the largest n <dig> to number of mis-assemblies ratio on all tested datasets when compared to other post-processing tools.


CONCLUSIONS
bigmac demonstrates the effectiveness of the post-processing approach in improving the quality of metagenomic assemblies.
