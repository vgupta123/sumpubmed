BACKGROUND
this study focused on the descriptive analysis of cattle movements and farm-level parameters derived from cattle movements, which are considered to be generically suitable for risk-based surveillance systems in switzerland for diseases where animal movements constitute an important risk pathway.

methods
a framework was developed to select farms for surveillance based on a risk score summarizing  <dig> parameters. the proposed framework was validated using data from the bovine viral diarrhoea  surveillance programme in  <dig> 


RESULTS
a cumulative score was calculated per farm, including the following parameters; the maximum monthly ingoing contact chain , the average number of animals per incoming movement, use of mixed alpine pastures and the number of weeks in  <dig> a farm had movements registered. the final score for the farm depended on the distribution of the parameters. different cut offs;  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 99 %, were explored. the final scores ranged between  <dig> and  <dig>  validation of the scores against results from the bvd surveillance programme  <dig> gave promising results for setting the cut off for each of the five selected farm level criteria at the 50th percentile. restricting testing to farms with a score ≥  <dig> would have resulted in the same number of detected bvd positive farms as testing all farms, i.e., the outcome of the  <dig> surveillance programme could have been reached with a smaller survey.


CONCLUSIONS
the seasonality and time dependency of the activity of single farms in the networks requires a careful assessment of the actual time period included to determine farm level criteria. however, selecting farms in the sample for risk-based surveillance can be optimized with the proposed scoring system. the system was validated using data from the bvd eradication program. the proposed method is a promising framework for the selection of farms according to the risk of infection based on animal movements.
