BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small non-coding rnas that can exert multilevel inhibition/repression at a post-transcriptional or protein synthesis level during disease or development. characterisation of mirnas in adult mammalian brains by deep sequencing has been reported previously. however, to date, no small rna profiling of the developing brain has been undertaken using this method. we have performed deep sequencing and small rna analysis of a developing  mouse brain.


RESULTS
we identified the expression of  <dig> known mirnas in the e <dig>  developing mouse brain, which were mostly represented by let- <dig> family and other brain-specific mirnas such as mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  we also discovered  <dig> putative 22- <dig> nt mirnas: mm_br_e15_ <dig>  mm_br_e15_ <dig>  mm_br_e15_ <dig> and mm_br_e15_ <dig> each with a 70- <dig> nt predicted pre-mirna. we validated the  <dig> putative mirnas and further characterised one of them, mm_br_e15_ <dig>  throughout embryogenesis. mm_br_e15_ <dig> biogenesis was dicer1-dependent and was expressed in e <dig>  blastocysts and e <dig> whole embryos. embryo-wide expression patterns were observed at e <dig>  and e <dig>  followed by a near complete loss of expression by e <dig> , with expression restricted to a specialised layer of cells within the developing and early postnatal brain. mm_br_e15_ <dig> was upregulated during neurodifferentiation of p <dig> teratocarcinoma cells. this novel mirna has been identified as mir- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we have generated and analysed the first deep sequencing dataset of small rna sequences of the developing mouse brain. the analysis revealed a novel mirna, mir- <dig>  with potential regulatory effects on early embryogenesis, and involvement in neuronal cell differentiation/function in the brain during late embryonic and early neonatal development.
