BACKGROUND
protein-coding gene detection in prokaryotic genomes is considered a much simpler problem than in intron-containing eukaryotic genomes. however there have been reports that prokaryotic gene finder programs have problems with small genes . therefore the question arises as to whether current genome annotations have systematically missing, small genes.


RESULTS
we have developed a high-performance computing methodology to investigate this problem. in this methodology we compare all orfs larger than or equal to  <dig> aa from all fully-sequenced prokaryotic replicons. based on that comparison, and using conservative criteria requiring a minimum taxonomic diversity between conserved orfs in different genomes, we have discovered  <dig>  candidate genes that are missing from current genome annotations. these missing genes are similar only to each other and do not have any strong similarity to gene sequences in public databases, with the implication that these orfs belong to missing gene families. we also uncovered  <dig>  intergenic orfs, readily identified as putative genes by similarity to currently annotated genes . the vast majority of the missing genes found are small . a comparison of select examples with genemark, easygene and glimmer predictions yields evidence that some of these genes are escaping detection by these programs.


CONCLUSIONS
prokaryotic gene finders and prokaryotic genome annotations require improvement for accurate prediction of small genes. the number of missing gene families found is likely a lower bound on the actual number, due to the conservative criteria used to determine whether an orf corresponds to a real gene.
