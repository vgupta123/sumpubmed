BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile is an anaerobic, gram-positive bacterium that can reside as a commensal within the intestinal microbiota of healthy individuals or cause life-threatening antibiotic-associated diarrhea in immunocompromised hosts. c. difficile can also form highly resistant spores that are excreted facilitating host-to-host transmission. the c. difficile spo0a gene encodes a highly conserved transcriptional regulator of sporulation that is required for relapsing disease and transmission in mice.


RESULTS
here we describe a genome-wide approach using a combined transcriptomic and proteomic analysis to identify spo0a regulated genes. our results validate spo0a as a positive regulator of putative and novel sporulation genes as well as components of the mature spore proteome. we also show that spo0a regulates a number of virulence-associated factors such as flagella and metabolic pathways including glucose fermentation leading to butyrate production.


CONCLUSIONS
the c. difficile spo0a gene is a global transcriptional regulator that controls diverse sporulation, virulence and metabolic phenotypes coordinating pathogen adaptation to a wide range of host interactions. additionally, the rich breadth of functional data allowed us to significantly update the annotation of the c. difficile  <dig> reference genome which will facilitate basic and applied research on this emerging pathogen.
