BACKGROUND
we explored spatio-temporal patterns of cortical activity evoked by written words from super-ordinate and sub-ordinate semantic categories and hoped to find a differential cortical and/or temporal distribution of the brain response depending on the level of the categories. twenty-three subjects saw  <dig> words belonging to six sub-ordinate categories  within two super-ordinate categories . visually evoked magnetic fields were determined from whole-head  magnetoencephalography and analyzed in the source space .


RESULTS
activity  100â€“ <dig> ms after stimulus onset in the left occipito-temporal area distinguished super-ordinate categories, while later activity  in the left temporal area distinguished the six sub-ordinate categories.


CONCLUSIONS
our results document temporally and spatially distinct processing and representation of words according to their categorical information. if further studies can rule out possible confounds then our results may help constructing a theory about the internal structure of entries in the mental lexicon and its access.
