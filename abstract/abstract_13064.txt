BACKGROUND
sample size calculation is an important issue in the experimental design of biomedical research. for rna-seq experiments, the sample size calculation method based on the poisson model has been proposed; however, when there are biological replicates, rna-seq data could exhibit variation significantly greater than the mean . the poisson model cannot appropriately model the over-dispersion, and in such cases, the negative binomial model has been used as a natural extension of the poisson model. because the field currently lacks a sample size calculation method based on the negative binomial model for assessing differential expression analysis of rna-seq data, we propose a method to calculate the sample size.


RESULTS
we propose a sample size calculation method based on the exact test for assessing differential expression analysis of rna-seq data.


CONCLUSIONS
the proposed sample size calculation method is straightforward and not computationally intensive. simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed sample size method are presented; the results indicate our method works well, with achievement of desired power.
