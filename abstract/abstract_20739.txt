BACKGROUND
common bacterial blight , incited by xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli , is a major yield-limiting factor of common bean  production around the world. host resistance is practically the most effective and environmentally-sound approach to control cbb. unlike conventional qtl discovery strategies, in which bi-parental populations  need to be developed, association mapping-based strategies can use plant breeding populations to synchronize qtl discovery and cultivar development.


RESULTS
a population of  <dig> dry bean lines of different market classes representing plant materials routinely developed in a bean breeding program were used. of them,  <dig> lines were evaluated for cbb resistance at  <dig> and  <dig> dai  in the summer of  <dig> in an artificially inoculated cbb nursery in south-western ontario. all lines were genotyped using  <dig> snps  evenly distributed across the genome. of the  <dig> snps,  <dig> snps had more than 20% missing data,  <dig> snps were monomorphic, and  <dig> snps had a maf  of less than  <dig> , therefore only  <dig> snps were used for association study, based on one snp per locus. the best possible population structure was to assign 36% and 64% of the lines into andean and mesoamerican subgroups, respectively. kinship analysis also revealed complex familial relationships among all lines, which corresponds with the known pedigree history. mlm  analysis, including population structure and kinship, was used to discover marker-trait associations. eighteen and  <dig> markers were significantly associated with cbb rating at  <dig> and  <dig> dai, respectively. fourteen markers were significant for both dates and the markers ubc <dig>  su <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  and g <dig> were highly significant . furthermore,  <dig> significant snp markers were co-localized with or close to the cbb-qtls identified previously in bi-parental qtl mapping studies.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that association mapping using a reasonable number of markers, distributed across the genome and with application of plant materials that are routinely developed in a plant breeding program can detect significant qtls for traits of interest.
