BACKGROUND
signatures are short sequences that are unique and not similar to any other sequence in a database that can be used as the basis to identify different species. even though several signature discovery algorithms have been proposed in the past, these algorithms require the entirety of databases to be loaded in the memory, thus restricting the amount of data that they can process. it makes those algorithms unable to process databases with large amounts of data. also, those algorithms use sequential models and have slower discovery speeds, meaning that the efficiency can be improved.


RESULTS
in this research, we are debuting the utilization of a divide-and-conquer strategy in signature discovery and have proposed a parallel signature discovery algorithm on a computer cluster. the algorithm applies the divide-and-conquer strategy to solve the problem posed to the existing algorithms where they are unable to process large databases and uses a parallel computing mechanism to effectively improve the efficiency of signature discovery. even when run with just the memory of regular personal computers, the algorithm can still process large databases such as the human whole-genome est database which were previously unable to be processed by the existing algorithms.


CONCLUSIONS
the algorithm proposed in this research is not limited by the amount of usable memory and can rapidly find signatures in large databases, making it useful in applications such as next generation sequencing and other large database analysis and processing. the implementation of the proposed algorithm is available athttp://www.cs.pu.edu.tw/~fang/ddcsdprograms/ddcsd.htm.
