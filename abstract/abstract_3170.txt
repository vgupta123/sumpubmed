BACKGROUND
clostridium butyricum has become increasingly important in preventing and treating intestinal inflammation. in the intestine it may increase the resistance of the gut to pathogen invasion via inducing the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. interleukin  <dig>  plays a central role in preventing certain inflammatory diseases by down-regulating inflammatory cascades. in a previous study, we observed that the level of il- <dig> mrna was modulated by c. butyricum. the aim of this study was to investigate whether c. butyricum achieves its beneficial effects through il- <dig> 


RESULTS
we treated ht- <dig> cells with anti-il- <dig>  or siil- <dig>  to disrupt il- <dig>  in both cases, the effects of c. butyricum-induced nf-Îºb activation and il- <dig> expression were enhanced. we also found that neutralization or knockdown of il- <dig> could induce apoptosis and necrosis of ht- <dig> cells treated with c. butyricum compared with control cells.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings show that il- <dig> serves an important role in c. butyricum-mediated immune protection, and in host recognition of c. butyricum.
