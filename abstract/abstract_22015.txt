BACKGROUND
the therapeutic efficacy of human mesenchymal stem cells  for the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic diseases is closely related to level of hypoxia in the damaged tissues. to elucidate the potential therapeutic applications and limitations of hmscs derived from human umbilical cords, the effects of hypoxia on the morphology and proliferation of hmscs were analyzed.


RESULTS
after treatment with dfo and cocl <dig>  hmscs were elongated, and adjacent cells were no longer in close contact. in addition, vacuole-like structures were observed within the cytoplasm; the rough endoplasmic reticulum expanded, and expanded ridges were observed in mitochondria. in addition, dfo and cocl <dig> treatments for  <dig> h significantly inhibited hmscs proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner . this treatment also increased the number of cells in g0/g <dig> phase and decreased those in g2/s/m phase.


CONCLUSIONS
the hypoxia-mimetic agents, dfo and cocl <dig>  alter umbilical cord-derived hmscs morphology and inhibit their proliferation through influencing the cell cycle.
