BACKGROUND
epimedium sagittatum  maxim, a traditional chinese medicinal plant species, has been used extensively as genuine medicinal materials. certain epimedium species are endangered due to commercial overexploition, while sustainable application studies, conservation genetics, systematics, and marker-assisted selection  of epimedium is less-studied due to the lack of molecular markers. here, we report a set of expressed sequence tags  and simple sequence repeats  identified in these ests for e. sagittatum.


RESULTS
cdnas of e. sagittatum are sequenced using  <dig> gs-flx pyrosequencing technology. the raw reads are cleaned and assembled into a total of  <dig>  consensus sequences comprising of  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singlets. about  <dig> %  of the consensus sequences significantly match to the non-redundant protein database ,  <dig>  of which are further annotated using gene ontology  terms. a total of  <dig>  est-ssrs is identified from the epimedium est dataset. trinucleotide ssr is the dominant repeat type  followed by dinucleotide , tetranuleotide , hexanucleotide , and pentanucleotide  ssr. the dominant repeat motif is aag/ctt  followed by ag/ct , acc/ggt , at/at , and aac/gtt . thirty-two ssr-ests are randomly selected and primer pairs are synthesized for testing the transferability across  <dig> epimedium species. eighteen primer pairs  could be successfully transferred to epimedium species and sixteen of those show high genetic diversity with  <dig>  of observed heterozygosity  and  <dig>  of expected heterozygosity  and high number of alleles per locus .


CONCLUSIONS
a large est dataset with a total of  <dig>  consensus sequences is generated, aiming to provide sequence information for deciphering secondary metabolism, especially for flavonoid pathway in epimedium. a total of  <dig>  est-ssrs is identified from est dataset and ~ <dig> est-ssr markers are transferable. e. sagittatum est-ssr transferability to the major epimedium germplasm is up to  <dig> %. therefore, this est dataset and est-ssrs will be a powerful resource for further studies such as taxonomy, molecular breeding, genetics, genomics, and secondary metabolism in epimedium species.
