BACKGROUND
knowledge of the linkage disequilibrium  between markers is important to establish the number of markers necessary for association studies and genomic selection. the objective of this study was to evaluate the extent of ld in nellore cattle using a high density snp panel and  <dig> genotyped steers.


RESULTS
after data editing,  <dig>  snps were used for the estimation of ld, comprising  <dig>  mb of the genome. the mean distance between adjacent markers was  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  kb. the minor allele frequency  was less than  <dig>  in a considerable proportion of snps. the overall mean ld between marker pairs measured by r <dig> and |d'| was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the ld  decreased with increasing physical distance between markers from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . in contrast to this clear decrease of ld measured by r <dig>  the changes in |d'| indicated a less pronounced decline of ld. chromosomes bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig> and bta <dig> showed lower levels of ld at any distance between markers. except for these four chromosomes, the level of ld  was higher than  <dig>  for markers separated by less than  <dig> kb. at distances <  <dig> kb, the level of ld was higher than  <dig> . the ld  between markers was higher when the maf threshold was high , especially when the distance between markers was short.


CONCLUSIONS
the level of ld estimated for markers separated by less than  <dig> kb indicates that the high density bovine snp beadchip will likely be a suitable tool for prediction of genomic breeding values in nellore cattle.
