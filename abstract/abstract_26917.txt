BACKGROUND
avian hepatitis e virus  is the main causative agent of big liver and spleen disease, as well as hepatitis-splenomegaly syndrome in chickens. to date, conventional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  and nested rt-pcr methods have been used for the diagnosis of avian hev infection in chickens. however, these assays are time consuming, inconvenient, and cannot detect the virus quantitatively. in this study, a rapid and sensitive sybr green real-time rt-pcr assay was developed to detect avian hev rna quantitatively in serum, liver, spleen, and fecal samples from chickens.


RESULTS
based on the sequence of the most conserved hev gene, orf <dig>  the primers for the assay were designed, and the standard plasmid was constructed. the detection limit of the assay was shown to be  <dig> copies/μl of standard plasmid/reaction, with a corresponding cycle-threshold value of  <dig> . the standard curve exhibited a dynamic linear range across at least  <dig> log units of dna copy number. the specificity and reproducibility of this assay was high, showing that the assay detected avian hev rna specifically and with little variability. compared to conventional rt-pcr, the current assay is more sensitive for detecting avian hev in serum, liver, spleen, and fecal samples from chickens.


CONCLUSIONS
a rapid, specific, and reproducible sybr green real-time rt-pcr assay was developed for the diagnosis of avian hev infection in chickens. this assay can accurately detect avian hev rna in serum, liver, spleen, and fecal samples with more sensitivity than conventional rt-pcr.
