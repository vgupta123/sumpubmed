BACKGROUND
chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model system for the biology of unicellular green algae. chemically regulated promoters, such as the nickel-inducible cyc <dig> or the low co2-inducible cah <dig> promoter, may prove useful for expressing, at precise times during its cell cycle, proteins with relevant biological functions, or complementing mutants in genes encoding such proteins. to this date, this has not been reported for the above promoters.


RESULTS
we fused the cyc <dig> and cah <dig> promoters to an ha-tagged rsp <dig> gene, encoding a protein of the flagellar radial spoke complex. the constructs were used for chemically regulated complementation of the pf <dig> mutant, carrying an ochre mutation in the rsp <dig> gene.  <dig> to 8% of the transformants showed cells with restored motility after induction with nickel or transfer to low co <dig> conditions, but not in non-inducing conditions. maximum complementation  was reached with very different kinetics . the two inducible promoters drive much lower levels of rsp <dig> protein expression than the constitutive psad promoter, which shows almost complete rescue of motility.


CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first example of the use of the cyc <dig> or cah <dig> promoters to perform a chemically regulated complementation of a chlamydomonas mutant. based on our data, the cyc <dig> and cah <dig> promoters should be capable of fully complementing mutants in genes whose products exert their biological activity at low concentrations.
