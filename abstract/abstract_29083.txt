BACKGROUND
revealing protein complexes are important for understanding principles of cellular organization and function. high-throughput experimental techniques have produced a large amount of protein interactions, which makes it possible to predict protein complexes from protein-protein interaction  networks. however, the small amount of known physical interactions may limit protein complex detection.

methods
the new ppi networks are constructed by integrating ppi datasets with the large and readily available ppi data from biomedical literature, and then the less reliable ppi between two proteins are filtered out based on semantic similarity and topological similarity of the two proteins. finally, the supervised learning protein complex detection , which can make full use of the information of available known complexes, is applied to detect protein complex on the new ppi networks.


RESULTS
the experimental results of slpc on two different categories yeast ppi networks demonstrate effectiveness of the approach: compared with the original ppi networks, the best average improvements of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  percentage units in the f-score, accuracy and maximum matching ratio  are achieved respectively; compared with the denoising ppi networks, the best average improvements of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  percentage units in the f-score, accuracy and mmr are achieved respectively; compared with clusterone, the start-of the-art complex detection method, on the denoising extended ppi networks, the average improvements of  <dig>  and  <dig>  percentage units in the f-score and mmr are achieved respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the experimental results show that the performances of slpc have a large improvement through integration of new receivable ppi data from biomedical literature into original ppi networks and denoising ppi networks. in addition, our protein complexes detection method can achieve better performance than clusterone.
