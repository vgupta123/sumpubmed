BACKGROUND
oligomeric and fibrillar aggregates of the amyloid β-peptide  have been implicated in the pathogenesis of alzheimer's disease . the characterization of aβ assemblies is essential for the elucidation of the mechanisms of aβ neurotoxicity, but requires large quantities of pure peptide. here we describe a novel approach to the recombinant production of aβ. the method is based on the coexpression of the affibody protein zaβ <dig>  a selected affinity ligand derived from the z domain three-helix bundle scaffold. zaβ <dig> binds to the amyloidogenic central and c-terminal part of aβ with nanomolar affinity and consequently inhibits aggregation.


RESULTS
coexpression of zaβ <dig> affords the overexpression of both major aβ isoforms, aβ and aβ, yielding  <dig> or  <dig> mg, respectively, of pure 15n-labeled peptide per liter of culture. the method does not rely on a protein-fusion or -tag and thus does not require a cleavage reaction. the purified peptides were characterized by nmr, circular dichroism, sds-page and size exclusion chromatography, and their aggregation propensities were assessed by thioflavin t fluorescence and electron microscopy. the data coincide with those reported previously for monomeric, largely unstructured aβ. zaβ <dig> coexpression moreover permits the recombinant production of aβ carrying the arctic  mutation, which causes early onset familial ad. aβe22g is obtained in predominantly monomeric form and suitable, e.g., for nmr studies.


CONCLUSIONS
the coexpression of an engineered aggregation-inhibiting binding protein offers a novel route to the recombinant production of amyloidogenic aβ peptides that can be advantageously employed to study the molecular basis of ad. the presented expression system is the first for which expression and purification of the aggregation-prone arctic variant  of aβ is reported.
