BACKGROUND
mapreduce is a parallel framework that has been used effectively to design large-scale parallel applications for large computing clusters. in this paper, we evaluate the viability of the mapreduce framework for designing phylogenetic applications. the problem of interest is generating the all-to-all robinson-foulds distance matrix, which has many applications for visualizing and clustering large collections of evolutionary trees. we introduce mrsrf , a multi-core algorithm to generate a t Ã— t robinson-foulds distance matrix between t trees using the mapreduce paradigm.


RESULTS
we studied the performance of our mrsrf algorithm on two large biological trees sets consisting of  <dig>  trees of  <dig> taxa each and  <dig>  trees of  <dig> taxa each. our experiments show that mrsrf is a scalable approach reaching a speedup of over  <dig> on  <dig> total cores. our results also show that achieving top speedup on a multi-core cluster requires different cluster configurations. finally, we show how to use an rf matrix to summarize collections of phylogenetic trees visually.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that mapreduce is a promising paradigm for developing multi-core phylogenetic applications. the results also demonstrate that different multi-core configurations must be tested in order to obtain optimum performance. we conclude that rf matrices play a critical role in developing techniques to summarize large collections of trees.
