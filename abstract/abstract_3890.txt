BACKGROUND
cyclic nucleotides are ubiquitous intracellular messengers. until recently, the roles of cyclic nucleotides in plant cells have proven difficult to uncover. with an understanding of the protein domains which can bind cyclic nucleotides  we scanned the completed genomes of the higher plants arabidopsis thaliana  and oryza sativa  for the effectors of these signalling molecules.


RESULTS
our analysis found that several ion channels and a class of thioesterases constitute the possible cyclic nucleotide binding proteins in plants. contrary to some reports, we found no biochemical or bioinformatic evidence for a plant cyclic nucleotide regulated protein kinase, suggesting that cyclic nucleotide functions in plants have evolved differently than in mammals.


CONCLUSIONS
this paper provides a molecular framework for the discussion of cyclic nucleotide function in plants, and resolves a longstanding debate about the presence of a cyclic nucleotide dependent kinase in plants.
