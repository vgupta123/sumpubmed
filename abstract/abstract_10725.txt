BACKGROUND
we studied a recent epizootic of getah virus infection among pigs in the southern part of ibaraki prefecture and the northern part of chiba prefecture, japan, focusing on its possible association with outbreaks in racehorses in  <dig> and  <dig>  the genomic sequence of a getah virus strain from an infected pig was analyzed to evaluate the degree of identity with the strains from horses.


RESULTS
sera were collected from pigs from september to december  <dig> to  <dig> in south ibaraki , and from september to december  <dig> to  <dig> in north chiba . they were examined by using a virus-neutralizing test for getah virus. seropositivity rates in 2012– <dig> in south ibaraki and 2010– <dig> in north chiba ranged from 0% to  <dig> %. in south ibaraki, seropositivity rates in  <dig>  and  <dig>  were significantly higher than those in the previous years ; 4/ <dig> batches had positive sera in  <dig> and 7/ <dig> in  <dig>  in north chiba, seropositivity rates in  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  were significantly higher than those in the previous years ; 6/ <dig> batches had positive sera in  <dig>  3/ <dig> in  <dig>  and 5/ <dig> in  <dig>  complete genome analysis revealed that the virus isolated from an infected pig had  <dig> % to  <dig> % nucleotide identity to the strains isolated from horses during the outbreaks in  <dig> and  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
serological surveillance of getah virus in pigs revealed that the virus was circulating in south ibaraki and north chiba in  <dig> and 2015; this was concomitant with the outbreaks in racehorses. the getah virus strain isolated from a pig was closely related to the ones from horses during the  <dig> and  <dig> outbreaks. to our knowledge, this is the first convincing case of simultaneous circulation of getah virus both among pigs and horses in specific areas.
