BACKGROUND
experimentally verified protein-protein interactions  cannot be easily retrieved by researchers unless they are stored in ppi databases. the curation of such databases can be facilitated by employing text-mining systems to identify genes which play the interactor role in ppis and to map these genes to unique database identifiers  and then to return a list of interaction pairs for each article . these two tasks are evaluated in terms of the area under curve of the interpolated precision/recall  score because the order of identifiers in the output list is important for ease of curation.


RESULTS
our int system developed for the biocreative ii. <dig> int challenge achieved a promising auc ip/r of  <dig> % by using a support vector machine -based ranking procedure. using our new re-ranking algorithm, we have been able to improve system performance  by  <dig> %. our experimental results also show that with the re-ranked int results, our unsupervised ipt system can achieve a competitive auc ip/r of  <dig> %, which outperforms the best bc ii. <dig> int system by  <dig> %. compared to using only svm ranked int results, using re-ranked int results boosts auc ip/r by  <dig> %. statistical significance t-test results show that our int/ipt system with re-ranking outperforms that without re-ranking by a statistically significant difference.


CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we present a new re-ranking algorithm that considers co-occurrence among identifiers in an article to improve int and ipt ranking results. combining the re-ranked int results with an unsupervised approach to find associations among interactors, the proposed method can boost the ipt performance. we also implement score computation using dynamic programming, which is faster and more efficient than traditional approaches.
