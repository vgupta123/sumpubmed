BACKGROUND
cattle shedding at least 104â€‰cfu escherichia coli o157:h7/g feces are described as super-shedders and have been shown to increase transmission of e. coli o157:h <dig> to other cattle in feedlots. this study investigated relationships among fecal isolates from super-shedders , perineal hide swab isolates  from super-shedders  and fecal isolates from low-shedder  pen-mates  using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis . a subsample of these fecal isolates  was tested for antimicrobial resistance. isolates of e. coli o157:h <dig> were obtained from cattle in pens  at  <dig> commercial feedlots in southern alberta with each steer sampled at entry to the feedlot and prior to slaughter.


RESULTS
only  <dig> steer maintained super-shedder status at both samplings, although approximately 30% of super-shedders in sampling  <dig> had low-shedder status at sampling  <dig>  a total of  <dig> restriction endonuclease digestion clusters  and  <dig> unique isolates  were detected, with the predominant repc  being isolated from cattle in all feedlot pens, although it was not associated with shedding status . only 2/ <dig> super-shedders had fecal isolates in the same repc at both samplings. fecal and ps isolates from individual super-shedders generally belonged to different repcs, although fecal isolates of e. coli o157:h <dig> from super- and low-shedders showed greater similarity  than those from ps. for 77% of super-shedders, pfge profiles of super-shedder fecal and ps isolates were distinct from all low-shedder fecal isolates collected in the same pen. a low level of antimicrobial resistance  was detected and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance did not differ among super- and low-shedder isolates , although all super-shedder isolates with antimicrobial resistance  were resistant to multiple antimicrobials.


CONCLUSIONS
super-shedders did not have increased antimicrobial resistance compared to low-shedder pen mates. our data demonstrated that pfge profiles of individual super-shedders varied over time and that only 1/ <dig> steers remained a super-shedder at  <dig> samplings. in these two commercial feedlots, pfge subtypes of e. coli o157:h <dig> from fecal isolates of super- and low-shedders were frequently different as were subtypes of fecal and perineal hide isolates from super-shedders.
