BACKGROUND
the micror <dig>  – gamyb pathway is conserved in higher plants, where gamyb, expression promotes programmed cell death in seeds  and anthers . in cereals, restriction of gamyb expression to seeds and anthers is mainly achieved transcriptionally, whereas in arabidopsis this is achieved post-transcriptionally, as mir <dig> silences gamyb  in vegetative tissues, but not in seeds and anthers. however, we cannot rule out a role for mir159-myb33/ <dig> pathway in arabidopsis vegetative tissues; a loss-of-function mir <dig> arabidopsis mutant displays strong pleiotropic defects and numerous reports have documented changes in mir <dig> abundance during stress and hormone treatments. hence, we have investigated the functional role of this pathway in vegetative tissues.


RESULTS
it was found that the mir159-myb33/ <dig> pathway was ubiquitously present throughout rosette development. however, mir <dig> appears to continuously repress myb33/myb <dig> expression to levels that have no major impact on rosette development. inducible inhibition of mir <dig> resulted in myb33/ <dig> de-repression and associated phenotypic defects, indicating that a potential role in vegetative development is only possible through myb <dig> and myb <dig> if mir <dig> levels decrease. however, mir <dig> silencing of myb33/ <dig> appeared extremely robust; no tested abiotic stress resulted in strong mir <dig> repression. consistent with this, the stress responses of an arabidopsis mutant lacking the mir159-myb33/ <dig> pathway were indistinguishable from wild-type. moreover, expression of viral silencing suppressors, either via transgenesis or viral infection, was unable to prevent mir <dig> repression of myb33/ <dig>  highlighting the robustness of mir159-mediated silencing.


CONCLUSIONS
despite being ubiquitously present, molecular, genetic and physiological analysis failed to find a major functional role for the mir159-myb33/ <dig> pathway in arabidopsis rosette development or stress response. although it is likely that this pathway is important for a stress not tested here or in different plant species, our findings argue against the mir159-myb33/ <dig> pathway playing a major conserved role in general stress response. finally, in light of the robustness of mir159-mediated repression of myb33/ <dig>  it appears unlikely that low fold-level changes of mir <dig> abundance in response to stress would have any major physiological impact in arabidopsis.
