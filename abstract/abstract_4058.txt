BACKGROUND
the higher-level phylogeny of placental mammals has long been a phylogenetic gordian knot, with disagreement about both the precise contents of, and relationships between, the extant orders. a recent mrp supertree that favoured 'outdated' hypotheses  has been heavily criticised for including low-quality and redundant data. we apply a stringent data selection protocol designed to minimise these problems to a much-expanded data set of morphological, molecular and combined source trees, to produce a supertree that includes every family of extant placental mammals.


RESULTS
the supertree is well-resolved and supports both polyphyly of lipotyphla and paraphyly of artiodactyla with respect to cetacea. the existence of four 'superorders' – afrotheria, xenarthra, laurasiatheria and euarchontoglires – is also supported. the topology is highly congruent with recent  phylogenetic analyses of placental mammals, but is considerably more comprehensive, being the first phylogeny to include all  <dig> extant families without making a priori assumptions of suprafamilial monophyly. subsidiary analyses reveal that the data selection protocol played a key role in the major changes relative to a previously published higher-level supertree of placentals.


CONCLUSIONS
the supertree should provide a useful framework for hypothesis testing in phylogenetic comparative biology, and supports the idea that biogeography has played a crucial role in the evolution of placental mammals. our results demonstrate the importance of minimising poor and redundant data when constructing supertrees.
