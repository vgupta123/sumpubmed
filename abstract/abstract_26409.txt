BACKGROUND
dna damage  triggers adapted cellular responses. these responses are elicited through signalling pathways, which activate cell cycle checkpoints and basically lead to three cellular fates: cycle arrest promoting dna repair, senescence  or cell death. cellular senescence is known for having a tumour-suppressive function and its regulation arouses a growing scientific interest. here, we advance a qualitative model covering dna damage response pathways, focusing on g1/s checkpoint enforcement, supposedly more sensitive to arrest than g2/m checkpoint.


RESULTS
we define a discrete, logical model encompassing atm  and atr  pathways activation upon dna damage, as well as g1/s checkpoint main components. it also includes the stress responsive protein p38mapk  known to be involved in the regulation of senescence. the model has four outcomes that convey alternative cell fates: proliferation,  cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence. different levels of dna damage are considered, defined by distinct combinations of single and double-strand breaks. each leads to a single stable state denoting the cell fate adopted upon this specific damage. a range of model perturbations corresponding to gene loss-of-function or gain-of-function is compared to experimental mutations.


CONCLUSIONS
as a step towards an integrative model of dna-damage response pathways to better cover the onset of senescence, our model focuses on g1/s checkpoint enforcement. this model qualitatively agrees with most experimental observations, including experiments involving mutations. furthermore, it provides some predictions.
