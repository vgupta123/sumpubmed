BACKGROUND
flax lignan, commonly known as secoisolariciresinol  diglucoside , has recently been reported with health-promoting activities, including its positive impact in metabolic diseases. however, not much was reported on the biosynthesis of sdg and its monoglucoside  until lately. flax ugt74s <dig> was recently reported to sequentially glucosylate seco into smg and sdg in vitro. however, whether this gene is the only ugt achieving seco glucosylation in flax was not known.


RESULTS
flax genome-wide mining for ugts was performed. phylogenetic and gene duplication analyses, heterologous gene expression and enzyme assays were conducted to identify family members closely related to ugt74s <dig> and to establish their roles in seco glucosylation. a total of  <dig> different ugts were identified, of which  <dig>  were duplicated. flax ugts diverged  <dig> – <dig>  mya and 71% were found to be under purifying selection pressure. ugt74s <dig>  a single copy gene located on chromosome  <dig>  displayed no evidence of duplication and was deemed to be under positive selection pressure. the phylogenetic analysis identified four main clusters where cluster  <dig>  which included ugt74s <dig>  was the most diverse. the duplicated ugt74s <dig> and ugt74s <dig>  located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were the most closely related to ugt74s <dig> and were differentially expressed in different tissues. heterologous expression levels of ugt74s <dig>  ugt74s <dig> and ugt74s <dig> proteins were similar but ugt74s <dig> and ugt74s <dig> glucosylation activity towards seco was seven fold less than ugt74s <dig>  in addition, they both failed to produce sdg, suggesting neofunctionalization following their divergence from ugt74s <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we showed that ugt74s <dig> is closely related to two duplicated genes, ugt74s <dig> and ugt74s <dig> which, unlike ugt74s <dig>  failed to glucosylate smg into sdg. the study suggests that ugt74s <dig> may be the key player in controlling seco glucosylation into sdg in flax although its closely related genes may also contribute to a minor extent in supplying the smg precursor to ugt74s <dig>
