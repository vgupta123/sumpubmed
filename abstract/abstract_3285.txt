BACKGROUND
all-trans retinoic acid  is one of the most important morphogens with pleiotropic actions. its embryonic distribution correlates with neural differentiation in the developing central nervous system. to explore the precise effects of ra on neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells , we detected expression of ra nuclear receptors and ra-metabolizing enzymes in mouse escs and investigated the roles of ra in adherent monolayer culture.


RESULTS
upon addition of ra, cell differentiation was directed rapidly and exclusively into the neural lineage. conversely, pharmacological interference with ra signaling suppressed this neural differentiation. inhibition of fibroblast growth factor  signaling did not suppress significantly neural differentiation in ra-treated cultures. pharmacological interference with extracellular signal-regulated kinase  pathway or activation of wnt pathway effectively blocked the ra-promoted neural specification. erk phosphorylation was enhanced in ra-treated cultures at the early stage of differentiation.


CONCLUSIONS
ra can promote neural lineage entry by escs in adherent monolayer culture systems. this effect depends on ra signaling and its crosstalk with the erk and wnt pathways.
