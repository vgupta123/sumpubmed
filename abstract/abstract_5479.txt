BACKGROUND
the identification of the mechanisms of adaptation of protein structures to extreme environmental conditions is a challenging task of structural biology. we performed molecular dynamics  simulations of the nip <dig> protein involved in rna processing from the shallow-water  and the deep-water  marine hyperthermophylic archaea at different temperatures  and pressures . the aim was to disclose similarities and differences between the deep- and shallow-sea protein models at different temperatures and pressures.


RESULTS
the current results demonstrate that the 3d models of the two proteins at all the examined values of pressures and temperatures are compact, stable and similar to the known crystal structure of the p. abyssi nip <dig>  the structural deviations and fluctuations in the polypeptide chain during the md simulations were the most pronounced in the loop regions, their magnitude being larger for the c-terminal domain in both proteins. a number of highly mobile segments the protein globule presumably involved in protein-protein interactions were identified. regions of the polypeptide chain with significant difference in conformational dynamics between the deep- and shallow-water proteins were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of our analysis demonstrated that in the examined ranges of temperatures and pressures, increase in temperature has a stronger effect on change in the dynamic properties of the protein globule than the increase in pressure. the conformational changes of both the deep- and shallow-sea protein models under increasing temperature and pressure are non-uniform. our current results indicate that amino acid substitutions between shallow- and deep-water proteins only slightly affect overall stability of two proteins. rather, they may affect the interactions of the nip <dig> protein with its protein or rna partners.
