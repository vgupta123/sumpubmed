BACKGROUND
the transcription factor yin yang  <dig>  is a ubiquitously expressed, multifunctional protein that controls a large number of genes and biological processes in vertebrates. as a general transcription factor, the proper levels of yy <dig> protein need to be maintained for the normal function of cells and organisms. however, the mechanism for the yy <dig> homeostasis is currently unknown.


RESULTS
the current study reports that the yy <dig> gene locus of all vertebrates contains a cluster of its own dna-binding sites within the 1st intron. the intact structure of these dna-binding sites is absolutely necessary for transcriptional activity of the yy <dig> promoter. in an inducible cell line system that over-expresses an exogenous yy <dig> gene, the overall increased levels of yy <dig> protein caused a reduction in transcription levels of the endogenous yy <dig> gene. reversion to the normal levels of yy <dig> protein restored the transcriptional levels of the endogenous yy <dig> to normal levels. this homeostatic response was also mediated through its cluster of yy <dig> binding sites.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the transcriptional level of yy <dig> is self-regulated through its internal dna-binding sites. this study identifies yy <dig> as the first known autoregulating transcription factor in mammalian genomes.
