BACKGROUND
the interactions between pdz  domains and pdz-binding motifs play central roles in signal transductions within cells. proteins with pdz domains bind to pdz-binding motifs almost exclusively when the motifs are located at the carboxyl  terminal ends of their binding partners. however, it remains little explored whether pdz-binding motifs show any preferential location at the c-terminal ends of proteins, at genome-level.


RESULTS
here, we examined the distribution of the type-i  or type-ii  pdz-binding motifs in proteins encoded in the genomes of five different species . we first established that these pdz-binding motifs are indeed preferentially present at their c-terminal ends. moreover, we found specific amino acid  bias for the 'x' positions in the motifs at the c-terminal ends. in general, hydrophilic aas were favored. our genomics-based findings confirm and largely extend the results of previous interaction-based studies, allowing us to propose refined consensus sequences for all of the examined pdz-binding motifs. an ontological analysis revealed that the refined motifs are functionally relevant since a large fraction of the proteins bearing the motif appear to be involved in signal transduction. furthermore, co-precipitation experiments confirmed two new protein interactions predicted by our genomics-based approach. finally, we show that influenza virus pathogenicity can be correlated with pdz-binding motif, with high-virulence viral proteins bearing a refined pdz-binding motif.


CONCLUSIONS
our refined definition of pdz-binding motifs should provide important clues for identifying functional pdz-binding motifs and proteins involved in signal transduction.
