BACKGROUND
several life history and ecological variables have been reported to affect the likelihood of species becoming urbanized. recently, studies have also focused on the role of brain size in explaining ability to adapt to urban environments. in contrast, however, little is known about the effect of colonization pressure from surrounding areas, which may confound conclusions about what makes a species urban. we recorded presence/absence data for birds in  <dig> urban sites in oslo  and compared these with species lists generated from  <dig> forest and  <dig> farmland sites surrounding oslo which may represent source populations for colonization.


RESULTS
we found that the frequency  of a species within the city was strongly and positively associated with its frequency in sites surrounding the city, as were both species breeding habitat and nest site location. in contrast, there were generally no significant effects of relative brain mass or migration on urban occupancy. furthermore, analyses of previously published data showed that urban density of birds in six other european cities was also positively and significantly associated with density in areas outside cities, whereas relative brain mass showed no such relationship.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that urban bird communities are primarily determined by how frequently species occurred in the surrounding landscapes and by features of ecology , whereas species’ relative brain mass had no significant effects.
