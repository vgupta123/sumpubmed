BACKGROUND
fruit growth in apple  is mediated by cell production and expansion. genes involved in regulating these processes and thereby fruit growth, are not well characterized. we hypothesized that the apple homolog of aintegumenta , an apetala2–repeat containing transcription factor, regulates cell production during fruit growth in apple.


RESULTS
two ant genes, mdant <dig> and mdant <dig>  were isolated from apple and their expression was studied during multiple stages of fruit development. mdant <dig> and mdant <dig> expression was high during early fruit growth coincident with the period of cell production, rapidly declined during exit from cell production, and remained low during the rest of fruit development. the effects of increase in carbohydrate availability during fruit growth were characterized. increase in carbohydrate availability enhanced fruit growth largely through an increase in cell production. expression of mdant <dig> and mdant <dig> increased sharply by up to around 5-fold in response to an increase in carbohydrate availability. expression of the ant genes was compared across two apple genotypes, ‘gala’ and ‘golden delicious smoothee’ , which differ in the extent of fruit growth, largely due to differences in cell production. in comparison to ‘gala’, the larger fruit-size genotype, gs, displayed higher levels and a longer duration of mdant <dig> and mdant <dig> expression. expression of the ants and cell cycle genes in the fruit core and cortex tissues isolated using laser capture microdissection was studied. during early fruit growth, expression of the mdants was higher within the cortex, the tissue that constitutes the majority of the fruit. additionally, mdant <dig> and mdant <dig> expression was positively correlated with that of a- and b-type cyclins, b-type cyclin-dependent-kinases  and mddel <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
multiple lines of evidence from this study suggest that mdant <dig> and mdant <dig> regulate cell production during fruit growth in apple. ants may coordinate the expression of cell proliferation genes and thereby affect the competence of cells for cell production during fruit growth. together, data from this study implicate mdant <dig> and mdant <dig> in the regulation of fruit growth in apple.
