BACKGROUND
signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  plays a critical role in tumor development by regulating signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, survival, metastasis and angiogenesis. stat <dig> is activated in many cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  in people. feline oral squamous cell carcinoma  is similar to advanced or recurrent hnscc as it is poorly responsive to traditional therapies and carries a poor long-term prognosis. the purpose of this study was to characterize expression and activation of stat <dig> in feline oscc cell lines and tumor samples and to investigate the biologic activity of a novel, allosteric stat <dig> inhibitor, lll <dig>  in feline oscc cell lines.


RESULTS
we evaluated  <dig> feline oscc cell lines and one of these  exhibited high levels of constitutive stat <dig> phosphorylation and high sensitivity to lll <dig> treatment. exposure of sccf <dig> cells to lll <dig> resulted in decreased expression of pstat <dig> and total stat <dig>  apoptosis as assessed by caspase 3/ <dig> activation, inhibition of colony formation and reduced expression of the stat <dig> transcriptional target survivin. in contrast, the stat <dig> transcriptional targets vegf and mcl- <dig> increased after lll <dig> treatment. this was, in part, likely due to lll <dig> mediated upregulation of hif-1α, which is known to drive vegf and mcl- <dig> expression. the oscc cell lines with low basal stat <dig> phosphorylation did not exhibit these effects, suggesting that stat <dig> inhibition was responsible for the observed results. lastly, immunohistochemistry for pstat <dig> was performed using a feline oscc tissue microarray, demonstrating expression in 48 % of samples tested.


CONCLUSIONS
these data demonstrate that lll <dig> has biologic activity against a feline oscc cell line expressing pstat <dig> and that stat <dig> represents a target for therapeutic intervention in this disease. however, given the up-regulation of several stat <dig> transcriptional targets following treatment, further investigation of stat <dig> and its related signaling pathways in oscc is warranted.
