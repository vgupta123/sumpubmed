BACKGROUND
analysis of the pathogen interactome is a powerful approach for dissecting potential signal transduction and virulence pathways. it also offers opportunities for exploring new drug targets.


RESULTS
in this study, a protein-protein interaction  network of mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv was constructed using a homogenous protein mapping method, which has shown molecular chaperones, ribosomal proteins and abc transporters to be highly interconnected proteins. a further analysis of this network unraveled the function of hypothetical proteins as well as a potential signaling pathway. a hypothetical protein, rv2752c, which was linked to a metal cation-transporting atpase, was characterized as a metal-beta-lactamase, through domain analysis in combination with an in vitro activity experiment. a second hypothetical protein, rv1354c, and an unknown protein kinase, pknk, interacted with a similar group of inner membrane-associated abc transporters in the ppi network. the interactions of rv <dig> with these proteins were also confirmed by a further bacterial two-hybrid analysis. according to protein domain structures, the unique m. tuberculosis rv1354c gene was proposed, for the first time, to be responsible for the turnover of cyclic-di-gmp, a second messenger molecule in this bacterium. a further structure-based inhibitors screening for rv1354c was also performed in silicon.


CONCLUSIONS
we constructed a comprehensive protein-protein interaction network for m. tuberculosis consisting of  <dig> proteins and  <dig> interaction pairs. our analysis unraveled the function of hypothetical proteins as well as a potential signaling pathway. the group of abc transporters, pknk, and rv1354c were proposed to constitute a potential membrane-associated signaling pathway that cooperatively responds to environmental stresses in m. tuberculosis. the study therefore provides valuable clues in exploring new signaling proteins, virulence pathways, and drug targets.
