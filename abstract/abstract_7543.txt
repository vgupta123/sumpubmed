BACKGROUND
urine within the urinary tract is commonly regarded as "sterile" in cultivation terms. here, we present a comprehensive in-depth study of bacterial 16s rdna sequences associated with urine from healthy females by means of culture-independent high-throughput sequencing techniques.


RESULTS
sequencing of the v1v <dig> and v <dig> regions of the 16s ribosomal rna gene using the  <dig> gs flx system was performed to characterize the possible bacterial composition in  <dig> culture-negative  healthy female urine specimens. sequences were compared to 16s rrna databases and showed significant diversity, with the predominant genera detected being lactobacillus, prevotella and gardnerella. the bacterial profiles in the female urine samples studied were complex; considerable variation between individuals was observed and a common microbial signature was not evident. notably, a significant amount of sequences belonging to bacteria with a known pathogenic potential was observed. the number of operational taxonomic units  for individual samples varied substantially and was in the range of  <dig> -  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
normal female urine displays a noticeable and variable bacterial 16s rdna sequence richness, which includes fastidious and anaerobic bacteria previously shown to be associated with female urogenital pathology.
