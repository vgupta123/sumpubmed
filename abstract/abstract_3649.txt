BACKGROUND
the human thymine-dna glycosylase  plays a dual role in base excision repair of g:u/t mismatches and in transcription. regulation of tdg activity by sumo- <dig> conjugation was shown to act on both functions. furthermore, tdg can interact with sumo- <dig> in a non-covalent manner.


RESULTS
using nmr spectroscopy we have determined distinct conformational changes in tdg upon either covalent sumoylation on lysine  <dig> or intermolecular sumo- <dig> binding through a unique sumo-binding motif  localized in the c-terminal region of tdg. the non-covalent sumo- <dig> binding induces a conformational change of the tdg amino-terminal regulatory domain . such conformational dynamics do not exist with covalent sumo- <dig> attachment and could potentially play a broader role in the regulation of tdg functions for instance during transcription. both covalent and non-covalent processes activate tdg g:u repair similarly. surprisingly, despite a dissociation of the sbm/sumo- <dig> complex in presence of a dna substrate, sumo- <dig> preserves its ability to stimulate tdg activity indicating that the non-covalent interactions are not directly involved in the regulation of tdg activity. sumo- <dig> instead acts, as demonstrated here, indirectly by competing with the regulatory domain of tdg for dna binding.


CONCLUSIONS
sumo- <dig> increases the enzymatic turnover of tdg by overcoming the product-inhibition of tdg on apurinic sites. the mechanism involves a competitive dna binding activity of sumo- <dig> towards the regulatory domain of tdg. this mechanism might be a general feature of sumo- <dig> regulation of other dna-bound factors such as transcription regulatory proteins.
