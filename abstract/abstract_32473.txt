BACKGROUND
the role of centrioles in mitotic spindle function remains unclear. one approach to investigate mitotic centriole function is to ask whether mutation of centriole-associated proteins can cause genomic instability.


RESULTS
we addressed the role of the centriole-associated ef-hand protein centrin in genomic stability using a chlamydomonas reinhardtii centrin mutant that forms acentriolar bipolar spindles and lacks the centrin-based rhizoplast structures that join centrioles to the nucleus. using a genetic assay for loss of heterozygosity, we found that this centrin mutant showed increased genomic instability compared to wild-type cells, and we determined that the increase in genomic instability was due to a 100-fold increase in chromosome loss rates compared to wild type. live cell imaging reveals an increased rate in cell death during g <dig> in haploid cells that is consistent with an elevated rate of chromosome loss, and analysis of cell death versus centriole copy number argues against a role for multipolar spindles in this process.


CONCLUSIONS
the increased chromosome loss rates observed in a centrin mutant that forms acentriolar spindles suggests a role for centrin protein, and possibly centrioles, in mitotic fidelity.
