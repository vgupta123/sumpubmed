BACKGROUND
both gossypium hirsutum and g. barbadense probably originated from a common ancestor, but they have very different agronomic and fiber quality characters. here we selected  <dig> fiber development-related genes to study their structures, tree topologies, chromosomal location and expression patterns to better understand the interspecific divergence of fiber development genes in the two cultivated tetraploid species.


RESULTS
the sequence and structure of  <dig> % genes were conserved with the same exon length and numbers in different species, while  <dig> % genes showed diversity. there were  <dig> genes showing independent evolution between the a- and d-subgenomes after polyploid formation, while two evolved via different degrees of colonization. chromosomal location showed that  <dig> duplicate genes were located in which at least one fiber quality qtl was detected. the molecular evolutionary rates suggested that the d-subgenome of the allotetraploid underwent rapid evolutionary differentiation, and selection had acted at the tetraploid level. expression profiles at fiber initiation and early elongation showed that the transcripts levels of most genes were higher in hai <dig> than in tm- <dig>  during the primary-secondary transition period, expression of most genes peaked earlier in tm- <dig> than in hai <dig>  homeolog expression profile showed that a-subgenome, or the combination of a- and d-subgenomes, played critical roles in fiber quality divergence of g. hirsutum and g. barbadense. however, the expression of d-subgenome alone also played an important role.


CONCLUSIONS
integrating analysis of the structure and expression to fiber development genes, suggests selective breeding for certain desirable fiber qualities played an important role in divergence of g. hirsutum and g. barbadense.
