BACKGROUND
in vertebrates, rod photoreceptor-specific gene expression is regulated by the large maf and pax-like transcription factors, nrl/lnrl and crx/otx <dig>  the ubiquitous occurrence of their target dna binding sites throughout rod-specific gene promoters suggests that multiple transcription factor interactions within the promoter are functionally important. cooperative action by these transcription factors activates rod-specific genes such as rhodopsin. however, a quantitative mechanistic explanation of transcriptional rate determinants is lacking.


RESULTS
we investigated the contributions of various paired-like transcription factors and their cognate cis-elements to rhodopsin gene activation using cultured cells to quantify activity. the xenopus rhodopsin promoter  has a bipartite structure, with ~200 bp proximal to the start site  coordinating cooperative activation by nrl/lnrl-crx/otx <dig> and the adjacent 5300 bp upstream sequence increasing the overall expression level. the synergistic activation by nrl/lnrl-crx/otx <dig> also occurred when xop was stably integrated into the genome. we determined that crx/otx <dig> synergistically activated transcription independently and additively through the two pax-like cis-elements, bat <dig> and ret <dig>  but not through ret <dig>  other pax-like family members, rax <dig> and rax <dig>  do not synergistically activate xop transcription with nrl/lnrl and/or crx/otx5; rather they act as co-activators via the ret <dig> cis-element.


CONCLUSIONS
we have provided a quantitative model of cooperative transcriptional activation of the rhodopsin promoter through interaction of crx/otx <dig> with nrl/lnrl at two paired-like cis-elements proximal to the nre and tata binding site. further, we have shown that rax genes act in cooperation with crx/otx <dig> with nrl/lnrl as co-activators of rhodopsin transcription.
