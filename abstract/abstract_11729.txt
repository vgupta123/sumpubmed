BACKGROUND
the mechanisms of immune response are structured within a highly complex regulatory system. genetic associations with variation in the immune response to rubella vaccine have typically been assessed one locus at a time. we simultaneously assessed the associations between  <dig> snps tagging  <dig> candidate immune response genes and rubella-specific antibody levels. blood samples were obtained from  <dig> school-aged children who had received two doses of mmr vaccine. associations between rubella-specific antibody levels and  <dig> candidate tagsnps were assessed both one snp at a time and in a variety of multigenic analyses.


RESULTS
single-snp assessments identified  <dig> snps that appeared to be univariately associated with rubella antibody levels: rs <dig>  and rs <dig>  in the 5'utr of the lta gene, rs <dig> in the 5'utr of the il <dig> gene , and rs <dig> in the 5'utr of the il4r gene . while there was not significant evidence in favor of epistatic genetic associations among the candidate snps, multigenic analyses identified  <dig> snps significantly associated with rubella antibody levels when selected as a group . this collection of snps included not only those that were significant univariately, but others that would not have been identified if only considered in isolation from the other snps.


CONCLUSIONS
for the first time, multigenic assessment of associations between candidate snps and rubella antibody levels identified a broad number of genetic associations that would not have been deemed important univariately. it is important to consider approaches like those applied here in order to better understand the full genetic complexity of response to vaccination.
