BACKGROUND
a crucial event in the development of the vertebrate neuromuscular junction  is the postsynaptic enrichment of muscle acetylcholine  receptors . this process involves two distinct steps: the local clustering of achrs at synapses, which depends on the activation of the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase musk by neural agrin, and the global dispersal of aneural or "pre-patterned" achr aggregates, which is triggered by ach or by synaptogenic stimuli. we and others have previously shown that tyrosine phosphatases, such as the sh <dig> domain-containing phosphatase shp <dig>  regulate achr cluster formation in muscle cells, and that tyrosine phosphatases also mediate the dispersal of pre-patterned achr clusters by synaptogenic stimuli, although the specific phosphatases involved in this latter step remain unknown.


RESULTS
using an assay system that allows achr cluster assembly and disassembly to be studied separately and quantitatively, we describe a previously unrecognized role of the tyrosine phosphatase shp <dig> in achr cluster disassembly. shp <dig> was robustly expressed in embryonic xenopus muscle in vivo and in cultured myotomal muscle cells, and treatment of the muscle cultures with an inhibitor of shp <dig>  blocked the dispersal of pre-patterned achr clusters by synaptogenic stimuli. in contrast, over-expression in muscle cells of either wild-type or constitutively active shp <dig> accelerated cluster dispersal. significantly, forced expression in muscle of the shp2-activator sirpα <dig>  also enhanced the disassembly of achr clusters, whereas the expression of a truncated sirpα <dig> mutant that suppresses shp <dig> signaling inhibited cluster disassembly.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that shp <dig> activation by synaptogenic stimuli, through signaling intermediates such as sirpα <dig>  promotes the dispersal of pre-patterned achr clusters to facilitate the selective accumulation of achrs at developing nmjs.
