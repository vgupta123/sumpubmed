BACKGROUND
with the accumulation of increasing omics data, a key goal of systems biology is to construct networks at different cellular levels to investigate cellular machinery of the cell. however, there is currently no satisfactory method to construct an integrated cellular network that combines the gene regulatory network and the signaling regulatory pathway.


RESULTS
in this study, we integrated different kinds of omics data and developed a systematic method to construct the integrated cellular network based on coupling dynamic models and statistical assessments. the proposed method was applied to s. cerevisiae stress responses, elucidating the stress response mechanism of the yeast. from the resulting integrated cellular network under hyperosmotic stress, the highly connected hubs which are functionally relevant to the stress response were identified. beyond hyperosmotic stress, the integrated network under heat shock and oxidative stress were also constructed and the crosstalks of these networks were analyzed, specifying the significance of some transcription factors to serve as the decision-making devices at the center of the bow-tie structure and the crucial role for rapid adaptation scheme to respond to stress. in addition, the predictive power of the proposed method was also demonstrated.


CONCLUSIONS
we successfully construct the integrated cellular network which is validated by literature evidences. the integration of transcription regulations and protein-protein interactions gives more insight into the actual biological network and is more predictive than those without integration. the method is shown to be powerful and flexible and can be used under different conditions and for different species. the coupling dynamic models of the whole integrated cellular network are very useful for theoretical analyses and for further experiments in the fields of network biology and synthetic biology.
