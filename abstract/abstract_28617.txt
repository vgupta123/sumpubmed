BACKGROUND
the ability to increase cellulose content and improve the stem strength of cereals could have beneficial applications in stem lodging and producing crops with higher cellulose content for biofuel feedstocks. here, such potential is explored in the commercially important crop barley through the manipulation of cellulose synthase genes .


RESULTS
barley plants transformed with primary cell wall  and secondary cell wall  barley cellulose synthase  cdnas driven by the camv 35s promoter, were analysed for growth and morphology, transcript levels, cellulose content, stem strength, tissue morphology and crystalline cellulose distribution. transcript levels of the pcw hvcesa transgenes were much lower than expected and silencing of both the endogenous cesa genes and introduced transgenes was often observed. these plants showed no aberrant phenotypes. although attempts to over-express the scw hvcesa genes also resulted in silencing of the transgenes and endogenous scw hvcesa genes, aberrant phenotypes were sometimes observed. these included brittle nodes and, with the 35s:hvcesa <dig> construct, a more severe dwarfing phenotype, where xylem cells were irregular in shape and partially collapsed. reductions in cellulose content were also observed in the dwarf plants and transmission electron microscopy showed a significant decrease in cell wall thickness. however, there were no increases in overall crystalline cellulose content or stem strength in the cesa over-expression transgenic plants, despite the use of a powerful constitutive promoter.


CONCLUSIONS
the results indicate that the cellulose biosynthetic pathway is tightly regulated, that individual cesa proteins may play different roles in the synthase complex, and that the sensitivity to cesa gene manipulation observed here suggests that in planta engineering of cellulose levels is likely to require more sophisticated strategies.
