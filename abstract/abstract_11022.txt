BACKGROUND
the class iia bacteriocin, pediocin pa- <dig>  has clear potential as food preservative and in the medical field to be used against gram negative pathogen species as enterococcus faecalis and listeria monocytogenes. resistance towards class iia bacteriocins appear in laboratory and characterization of these phenotypes is important for their application. to gain insight into bacteriocin resistance we studied mutants of e. faecalis v <dig> resistant to pediocin pa- <dig> by use of transcriptomic analyses.


RESULTS
mutants of e. faecalis v <dig> resistant to pediocin pa- <dig> were isolated, and their gene expression profiles were analyzed and compared to the wild type using whole-genome microarray. significantly altered transcription was detected from about  <dig> genes; most of them encoding proteins involved in energy metabolism and transport. glycolytic genes were down-regulated in the mutants, but most of the genes showing differential expression were up-regulated. the data indicate that the mutants were relieved from glucose repression and putative catabolic responsive elements  could be identified in the upstream regions of 70% of the differentially expressed genes. bacteriocin resistance was caused by reduced expression of the mpt operon encoding the mannose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system , and the same transcriptional changes were seen in a mptd-inactivated mutant. this mutant also had decreased transcription of the whole mpt operon, showing that the pts is involved in its own transcriptional regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
our data confirm the important role of mannose pts in class iia bacteriocin sensitivity and we demonstrate its importance involving global carbon catabolite control.
