BACKGROUND
phosphorus , an essential macronutrient, is often limiting in soils and affects plant growth and development. in arabidopsis thaliana, low phosphate root <dig>  and its close paralog lpr <dig> encode multicopper oxidases . they regulate meristem responses of root system to phosphate  deficiency. however, the roles of lpr gene family in rice  in maintaining pi homeostasis have not been elucidated as yet.


RESULTS
here, the identification and expression analysis for the homologs of lpr1/ <dig> in rice were carried out. five homologs, hereafter referred to as oslpr1- <dig>  were identified in rice, which are distributed on chromosome <dig> over a range of 65 kb. phylogenetic analysis grouped oslpr1/3/4/ <dig> and oslpr <dig> into two distinct sub-clades with oslpr <dig> and  <dig> showing close proximity. quantitative real-time rt-pcr  analysis revealed higher expression levels of oslpr3- <dig> and oslpr <dig> in root and shoot, respectively. deficiencies of different nutrients ie, p, nitrogen , potassium , magnesium  and iron  exerted differential and partially overlapping effects on the relative expression levels of the members of oslpr family. pi deficiency  triggered significant increases in the relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> and  <dig>  strong induction in the relative expression levels of oslpr <dig> and  <dig> in osphr <dig> suggested their negative transcriptional regulation by osphr <dig>  further, the expression levels of oslpr <dig> and  <dig> were either attenuated in ossiz <dig> and ospho <dig> or augmented in rice overexpressing osspx <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the results from this study provided insights into the evolutionary expansion and a likely functional divergence of oslpr family with potential roles of oslpr <dig> and  <dig> in the maintenance of pi homeostasis in rice.
