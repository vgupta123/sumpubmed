BACKGROUND
ca2+ ion is a versatile second messenger that operate in a wide ranges of cellular processes that impact nearly every aspect of life. ca2+ regulates gene expression and biotic and abiotic stress responses in organisms ranging from unicellular algae to multi-cellular higher plants through the cascades of calcium signaling processes.


RESULTS
in this study, we deciphered the genomics and evolutionary aspects of calcium signaling event of calmodulin  and calmodulin like-  proteins. we studied the cam and cml gene family of  <dig> different species across the plant lineages. genomic analysis showed that plant encodes more calmodulin like-protein than calmodulins. further analyses showed, the majority of cmls were intronless, while cams were intron rich. multiple sequence alignment showed, the ef-hand domain of cam contains four conserved d-x-d motifs, one in each ef-hand while cmls contain only one d-x-d-x-d motif in the fourth ef-hand. phylogenetic analysis revealed that, the cmls were evolved earlier than cam and later diversified. gene expression analysis demonstrated that different cam and cmls genes were express differentially in different tissues in a spatio-temporal manner.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study we provided in detailed genome-wide identifications and characterization of cam and cml protein family, phylogenetic relationships, and domain structure. expression study of cam and cml genes were conducted in glycine max and phaseolus vulgaris. our study provides a strong foundation for future functional research in cam and cml gene family in plant kingdom.
