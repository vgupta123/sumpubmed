BACKGROUND
it has been shown that human immunodeficiency virus - <dig> infection induces the production of endogenous lipids required for effective viral production, and the cluster of differentiation  <dig> molecule cd1d is downregulated by hiv- <dig> infection. however, the role of endogenous lipid presentation and the implications of cd <dig> downregulation by hiv- <dig> infection have not yet been characterized.


RESULTS
in this study, we observed downregulation of both cd1c and cd1d expression through a vpu-dependent and nef-independent mechanism, and the concomitant hiv-1-induced production of host cholesterol decreased the extent of cd1c and cd1d modulation. while the modest downregulation of cd1c by hiv- <dig> infection decreased the ability of cd1c-restricted t cells to respond and secrete interferon-Î³, the cholesterol upregulation in the same cells by hiv- <dig> infection appears to limit the downregulation of cd1c.


CONCLUSIONS
the two conflicting hiv-1-mediated changes in cd1c expression appear to minimize the modulation of cd1c expression, thus leading the host to maintain a cd1c-restricted t-cell response against hiv- <dig>
