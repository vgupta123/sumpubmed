BACKGROUND
as is true for many other antibiotic-resistant gram-negative pathogens, members of the burkholderia cepacia complex  are currently being assessed for their susceptibility to phage therapy as an antimicrobial treatment. the objective of this study was to perform genomic and limited functional characterization of the novel bcc phage jg <dig> .


RESULTS
jg <dig> is a podovirus that forms large, clear plaques on burkholderia cenocepacia k56- <dig>  host range analysis indicates that this phage can infect environmental, clinical, and epidemic isolates of burkholderia multivorans, b. cenocepacia, burkholderia stabilis, and burkholderia dolosa, likely through interaction with the host lipopolysaccharide as a receptor. the jg <dig> chromosome is  <dig>  base pairs  in length and is flanked by  <dig> bp short direct terminal repeats. gene expression originates from both host and phage promoters and is in the forward direction for all  <dig> open reading frames. the genome sequence shows similarity to ralstonia phage ϕrsb <dig>  caulobacter phage cd <dig>  and uncharacterized genetic loci of blood disease bacterium r <dig> and burkholderia pseudomallei 1710b. coregenesuniquegenes analysis indicates that jg <dig> belongs to the autographivirinae subfamily and ϕkmv-like phages genus. modules within the genome encode proteins involved in dna-binding, morphogenesis, and lysis, but none associated with pathogenicity or lysogeny. similar to the signal-arrest-release  endolysin of ϕkmv, inducible expression of the jg <dig> sar endolysin causes lysis of escherichia coli that is dependent on the presence of an n-terminal signal sequence. in an in vivo assay using the galleria mellonella infection model, treatment of b. cenocepacia k56-2-infected larvae with jg <dig> results in a significant increase in larval survival.


CONCLUSIONS
as jg <dig> has a broad host range, does not encode virulence factors, is obligately lytic, and has activity against an epidemic b. cenocepacia strain in vivo, this phage is a highly promising candidate for bcc phage therapy development.
