BACKGROUND
white matter hyperintensities  can lead to dementia but the underlying physiological mechanisms are unclear. we compared relative oscillatory power from electroencephalographic studies  of  <dig> patients with subcortical ischemic vascular dementia, based on extensive white matter hyperintensities  with  <dig> controls to investigate physiological changes underlying this diagnosis.


RESULTS
differences between the groups were large, with a decrease of relative power of fast activity in patients  and an increase in relative powers of slow activity in patients . lower relative beta power was related to worse cognitive performance in a linear regression analysis .


CONCLUSIONS
this pattern of disturbance in oscillatory brain activity indicate loss of connections between neurons, providing a first step in the understanding of cognitive dysfunction in sivd-wmh.
