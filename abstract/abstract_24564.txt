BACKGROUND
probimane , an anti-cancer agent originating in china, was derived from razoxane , a drug created in britain, specifically targeting at cancer metastasis and as a cardioprotectant of anthrocyclines. pro and raz are bisdioxopiperazine compounds. in this work, we evaluated the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects of pro and raz in vivo against two lung tumor models, one of murine origin  and one of human origin .


RESULTS
after determining the lethal dosage of pro and raz, we assessed and compared the inhibitory effects of pro and raz against primary tumor growth and metastatic occurrences of llc at the dosage of ld <dig>  pro and raz were active against primary tumor growth and significantly inhibited pulmonary metastasis of llc at same dose-ranges . both raz and pro were effective in  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> day administration schedules. three different schedules of raz and pro were effective against the primary tumor growth of llc . the synergistic anticancer effect of raz with bleomycin   was more obvious than those with daunorubicin   in the llc tumor model. pro was also seen to have synergistic anti-cancer effects with ble in the llc model. both raz and pro inhibited the growth of lax  <dig> in a statistically significant manner.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that both raz and pro may have anti-tumor potentiality and raz and pro have combinative effects with ble or dau. the potential targets of bisdioxopiperazines may include lung cancers, especially on tumor metastasis. the anti-cancer effects of raz and pro can be increased with the help of other anticancer drugs.
