BACKGROUND
gene flow is traditionally considered a limitation to speciation because selection is required to counter the homogenising effect of allele exchange. here we report on two sympatric short-horned grasshoppers species in the south island of new zealand; one  widespread and the other  a narrow endemic.


RESULTS
of the  <dig> putatively neutral markers  all but one marker we examined showed extensive allele sharing, and similar or identical allele frequencies in the two species where they co-occur. we found no genetic evidence of deviation from random mating in the region of sympatry. however, analysis of morphological and geometric traits revealed no evidence of morphological introgression.


CONCLUSIONS
based on phenotype the two species are clearly distinct, but their genotypes thus far reveal no divergence. the best explanation for this is that some loci associated with the distinguishing morphological characters are under strong selection, but exchange of neutral loci is occurring freely between the two species. although it is easier to define species as requiring a barrier between them, a dynamic model that accommodates gene flow is a biologically more reasonable explanation for these grasshoppers.
