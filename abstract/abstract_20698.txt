BACKGROUND
in a large number of studies, members of the microrna - <dig> family such as mirna-34a, mirna-34b, mirna-34c, as well as mirna-125b and mirna- <dig>  have been shown to be regulators of apoptosis. the ability of these mirnas to perform this function is mainly attributed to their ability to interact with the p <dig> tumor suppressor, which is a powerful regulator of the teratologic susceptibility of embryos. we chose to explore whether mirna-34a/b/c, mirna-125b and mirna- <dig> may play a role in teratogenesis by using p53+/- pregnant mice treated with cyclophosphamide  as a model. we evaluated how cp-induced alterations in the expression of these mirnas in the embryonic limbs correlate with embryonic p <dig> genotype and cp-induced limb phenotypes.


RESULTS
the limbs of p <dig> positive embryos were more sensitive to cp-induced teratogenic insult than the limbs of p <dig> negative embryos. the hindlimbs were more severely affected than the forelimbs. robust mirna-34a expression was observed in the fore- and hindlimbs of p53+/+ embryos exposed to  <dig>  mg/kg cp. the dose of  <dig> mg/kg cp induced almost a two-fold increase in the level of mirna-34a expression as compared to that exhibited by p53+/+ embryos exposed to a lower dose. increased mirna-34b and mirna-34c expression was also observed. of note, this dose activated mirna-34a and mirna-34c in the forelimbs of p53-/- embryos. when embryos were exposed to  <dig> mg/kg cp, the expression pattern of the mirna-34a/b/c was identical to that registered in the limbs of embryos exposed to  <dig> mg/kg cp. however, this dose suppressed mirna-125b and mirna- <dig> expression in the fore- and hindlimbs of p53+/+ embryos.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that teratogen-induced limb dysmorphogenesis may be associated with alterations in mirna- <dig>  mirna-125b and mirna- <dig> expression. it also suggests for the first time that p53-independent mechanisms exist contributing to teratogen-induced activation of mirna-34a and mirna-34c. at the same time, teratogen-induced suppression of mirna-125b and mirna- <dig> expression may be p <dig> dependent. the analysis of correlations between the expression pattern of the tested mirnas and cp induced limb phenotypes implies that mirnas regulating apoptosis may differ from each other with respect to their functional role in teratogenesis: some mirnas act to protect embryos, whereas other mirnas boost a teratogen-induced process of maldevelopment to induce embryonic death.
