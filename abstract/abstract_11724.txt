BACKGROUND
burkholderia pseudomallei  is a category b biothreat organism that causes a potentially fatal disease in humans and animals, namely melioidosis. burkholderia thailandensis  is another naturally occurring species that is very closely related to bp. however, despite this closely related genotype, bt is considered avirulent as it does not cause the disease. in the present study, we compared the growth kinetics of b. pseudomallei strain  <dig>  in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells  and macrophages , as well as its ability to stimulate host cell responses with those of b. thailandensis strain ue <dig> .


RESULTS
primary human modcs and mφs were infected with bp- <dig> and its intracellular growth kinetics and ability to induce host cell responses were evaluated. the results were compared with those obtained using the bt-ue <dig>  in human modcs, both bacteria were similar in respect to their ability to survive and replicate intracellularly, induce upregulation of costimulatory molecules and cytokines and bias t helper cell differentiation toward a th <dig> phenotype. by contrast, the two bacteria exhibited different growth kinetics in human mφs, where the intracellular growth of bt-ue <dig>  but not bp- <dig>  was significantly suppressed. moreover, the ability of mφs to kill bp- <dig> was markedly enhanced following stimulation with ifn-γ.


CONCLUSIONS
the data presented showed that while both strains were similar in their ability to survive and replicate in human modcs, only bp- <dig> could readily replicate in human mφs. both bacteria induced similar host cellular responses, particularly with regard to their ability to bias t cell differentiation toward a th <dig> phenotype.
