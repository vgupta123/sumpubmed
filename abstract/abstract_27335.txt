BACKGROUND
bacterial genomes are mosaic structures composed of genes present in every strain of the same species , and genes present in some but not all strains of a species . the aim of this study was to compare the genetic diversity of core and accessory genes of a salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar typhimurium  population isolated from food-animal and human sources in four regions of mexico. multilocus sequence typing  and macrorestriction fingerprints by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  were used to address the core genetic variation, and genes involved in pathogenesis and antibiotic resistance were selected to evaluate the accessory genome.


RESULTS
we found a low genetic diversity for both housekeeping and accessory genes. sequence type  <dig>  was supported as the founder genotype of sts  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  we found a temporal pattern in which the derived st <dig> is replacing the founder st <dig> in the four geographic regions analyzed and a geographic trend in the number of resistance determinants. the distribution of the accessory genes was not random among chromosomal genotypes. we detected strong associations among the different accessory genes and the multilocus chromosomal genotypes . first, the salmonella virulence plasmid  was found mostly in st <dig> isolates. second, the plasmid-borne betalactamase cmy- <dig> was found only in st <dig> isolates. third, the most abundant integron, ip- <dig> , was found only in st <dig> isolates. fourth, the salmonella genomic island  was found mainly in a subgroup of st <dig> isolates carrying pstv. the mapping of accessory genes and multilocus genotypes on the dendrogram derived from macrorestiction fingerprints allowed the establishment of genetic subgroups within the population.


CONCLUSIONS
despite the low levels of genetic diversity of core and accessory genes, the non-random distribution of the accessory genes across chromosomal backgrounds allowed us to discover genetic subgroups within the population. this study provides information about the importance of the accessory genome in generating genetic variability within a bacterial population.
