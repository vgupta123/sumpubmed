BACKGROUND
monitoring alien introgressions in crop plants is difficult due to the lack of genetic and molecular mapping information on the wild crop relatives. the tertiary gene pool of wheat is a very important source of genetic variability for wheat improvement against biotic and abiotic stresses. by exploring the 5mg short arm  of aegilops geniculata, we can apply chromosome genomics for the discovery of snp markers and their use for monitoring alien introgressions in wheat .


RESULTS
the short arm of chromosome 5mg of ae. geniculata roth  was flow-sorted from a wheat line in which it is maintained as a telocentric chromosome. dna of the sorted arm was amplified and sequenced using an illumina hiseq  <dig> with ~45x coverage. the sequence data was used for snp discovery against wheat homoeologous group- <dig> assemblies. a total of  <dig>  unique, 5mgs-specific snps were discovered. randomly selected samples of  <dig> 5mgs-specific snps were tested  and 84% were validated. of the selected snps, 97% mapped to a chromosome 5mg addition to wheat , and 94% to 5mg introgressed from a different accession of ae. geniculata substituting for chromosome 5d of wheat. the validated snps also identified chromosome segments of 5mgs origin in a set of t5d-5mg translocation lines; eight snps  mapped to ta <dig>  and three  to ta <dig> . snps , tagging chromosome t5dl · 5ds-5mgs with the smallest introgression carrying resistance to leaf rust  and stripe rust , were validated in two released germplasm lines with lr <dig> and yr <dig> genes.


CONCLUSIONS
this approach should be widely applicable for the identification of species/genome-specific snps. the development of a large number of snp markers will facilitate the precise introgression and monitoring of alien segments in crop breeding programs and further enable mapping and cloning novel genes from the wild relatives of crop plants.
