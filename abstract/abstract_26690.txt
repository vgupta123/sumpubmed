BACKGROUND
infection of mice with the armstrong strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus  leads to a robust immune response and efficient viral clearance. this is in contrast to infection with the variant strain lcmvclone <dig>  which causes functional inactivation of effector t cells and viral persistence. the mechanism by which lcmvclone <dig> suppresses the antiviral immune response and persists in its host is unknown.


RESULTS
here we demonstrate that infection with lcmvclone <dig>  but not with lcmvarm, resulted in a steady increase in the serum levels of the immuno-inhibitory cytokine, il- <dig>  blockade of il- <dig> using neutralizing monoclonal antibody injections in lcmvclone13-infected mice led to dramatically enhanced effector t cell responses at  <dig> days post-infection. even though il- <dig> blockade resulted in decreased viral titers, the generation and maintenance of memory t cells was still compromised. the functional inactivation of cd8+ t cells in il-10-blocked, chronically infected mice  <dig> days post-infection was incomplete as potent ctl  could be generated by in vitro re-stimulation. il- <dig> knockout mice showed a similar pattern of antiviral cd <dig> t cell responses: early antiviral t cells were dramatically increased and viral levels were decreased; however, cd <dig> t cells in il- <dig> knockout mice were also eventually anergized and these mice became persistently infected.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that il- <dig> plays an early role in lcmvclone13-induced tolerance, although other factors collaborate with il- <dig> to induce virus-specific tolerance.
