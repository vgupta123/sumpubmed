BACKGROUND
the behaviour of tumour cells depends on factors such as genetics and the tumour microenvironment. the latter plays a crucial role in normal mammary gland development and also in breast cancer initiation and progression. breast cancer tissues tend to be highly desmoplastic and dense matrix as a pre-existing condition poses one of the highest risk factors for cancer development. however, matrix influence on tumour cell gene expression and behaviour such as cell migration is not fully elucidated.


RESULTS
we generated high-density  matrices that mimicked tumour collagen content of 20 mg/cm <dig> that were ~14-fold stiffer than low-density  matrix of 1 mg/cm <dig>  live-cell imaging showed breast cancer cells utilizing cytoplasmic streaming and cell body contractility for migration within hd matrix. cell migration was blocked in the presence of both the rock inhibitor, y- <dig>  and the mmp inhibitor, gm <dig>  but not by the drugs individually. this suggests roles for rock <dig> and mmp in cell migration are complicated by compensatory mechanisms. rock <dig> expression and protein activity, were significantly upregulated in hd matrix but these were blocked by treatment with a histone deacetylase  inhibitor, ms- <dig>  in hd matrix, the inhibition of rock <dig> by ms- <dig> was indirect and relied upon protein synthesis and notch <dig>  inhibition of notch <dig> using pooled sirna or dapt abrogated the inhibition of rock <dig> by ms- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
increased matrix density elevates rock <dig> activity, which aids in cell migration via cell contractility. the upregulation of rock <dig> is epigenetically regulated in an indirect manner involving the repression of notch <dig>  this is demonstrated from inhibition of hdacs by ms- <dig>  which caused an upregulation of notch <dig> levels leading to blockade of rock <dig> expression.
