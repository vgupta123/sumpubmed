BACKGROUND
several recent studies have demonstrated the use of roche  <dig> sequencing technology for de novo transcriptome analysis. low error rates and high coverage also allow for effective snp discovery and genetic diversity estimates. however, genetically diverse datasets, such as those sourced from natural populations, pose challenges for assembly programs and subsequent analysis. further, estimating the effectiveness of transcript discovery using roche  <dig> transcriptome data is still a difficult task.


RESULTS
using the roche  <dig> flx titanium platform, we sequenced and assembled larval transcriptomes for two butterfly species: the propertius duskywing, erynnis propertius  and the anise swallowtail, papilio zelicaon . the expressed sequence tags  generated represent a diverse sample drawn from multiple populations, developmental stages, and stress treatments.

despite this diversity, > 95% of the ests assembled into long  and highly covered  contigs. to estimate the effectiveness of transcript discovery, we compared the number of bases in the hit region of unigenes  to the length of the best match silkworm  protein--this "ortholog hit ratio" gives a close estimate on the amount of the transcript discovered relative to a model lepidopteran genome. for each species, we tested two assembly programs and two parameter sets; although cap <dig> is commonly used for such data, the assemblies produced by celera assembler with modified parameters were chosen over those produced by cap <dig> based on contig and singleton counts as well as ortholog hit ratio analysis. in the final assemblies,  <dig>  e. propertius and  <dig>  p. zelicaon unigenes had a ratio >  <dig> ;  <dig>  e. propertius and  <dig>  p. zelicaon unigenes had a ratio >  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
ultimately, these assemblies and snp data will be used to generate microarrays for ecoinformatics examining climate change tolerance of different natural populations. these studies will benefit from high quality assemblies with few singletons  and effective transcript discovery .
