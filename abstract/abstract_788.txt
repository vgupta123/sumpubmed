BACKGROUND
the production of ethyl alcohol by fermentation represents the largest scale application of saccharomyces cerevisiae in industrial biotechnology. increased worldwide demand for fuel bioethanol is anticipated over the next decade and will exceed  <dig> billion liters from further expansions. our working hypothesis was that the drop in atp level in s. cerevisiae cells during alcoholic fermentation should lead to an increase in ethanol production  with a greater amount of the utilized glucose converted to ethanol. our approach to achieve this goal is to decrease the intracellular atp level via increasing the unspecific alkaline phosphatase activity.


RESULTS
intact and truncated versions of the s. cerevisiae pho <dig> gene coding for vacuolar or cytosolic forms of alkaline phosphatase were fused with the alcohol dehydrogenase gene  promoter. the constructed expression cassettes used for transformation vectors also contained the dominant selective marker kanmx <dig> and s. cerevisiae δ-sequence to facilitate multicopy integration to the genome. laboratory and industrial ethanol producing strains by <dig> and as <dig> overexpressing vacuolar form of alkaline phosphatase were characterized by a slightly lowered intracellular atp level and biomass accumulation and by an increase in ethanol productivity  when compared to the parental strains. the strains expressing truncated cytosolic form of alkaline phosphatase showed a prolonged lag-phase, reduced biomass accumulation and a strong defect in ethanol production.


CONCLUSIONS
overexpression of vacuolar alkaline phosphatase leads to an increased ethanol yield in s. cerevisiae.
