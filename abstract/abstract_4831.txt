BACKGROUND
the sacred lotus  is widely cultivated in china for its edible rhizomes and seeds. traditional plant breeding methods have been used to breed cultivars with increased yields and quality of rhizomes and seeds with limited success. currently, the available genetic maps and molecular markers in lotus are too limited to be useful for molecular genetics based breeding programs. however, the development of next-generation sequencing  technologies has enabled large-scale identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms  for genetic map construction. in this study, we constructed an snp-based high-density genetic map for cultivated lotus using double digest restriction site-associated dna sequencing .


RESULTS
an f <dig> population of  <dig> individuals was derived from a cross between the rhizome lotus cultivar ‘juwuba’  and the seed lotus cultivar ‘mantianxing’ . genomic dnas from this population were digested with the restriction enzymes ecori and mspi and then sequenced. in total,  <dig>  gb of raw data containing  <dig> , <dig>  pair-end reads were obtained. the coverage of reads on a reference genome was  <dig>  % for the female parent,  <dig>  % for the male parent, and  <dig>  % for f <dig> individuals. from these reads,  <dig>  valid snp markers were used for genetic map construction. finally,  <dig> bin markers , consisting of  <dig>  snp markers, were sorted into  <dig> linkage groups  that spanned  <dig>  cm, with an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm. a total of  <dig> genome sequence scaffolds, covering about  <dig>  cm of the wild sacred lotus genome, were anchored on the genetic map, accounting for  <dig>  % of the genome assembly.


CONCLUSIONS
this study reports the large-scale discovery of snps between cultivars of rhizome and seed lotus using a ddradseq library combined with ngs. these snps have been used to construct the first high-density genetic map for cultivated lotus that can serve as a genomic reference and will facilitate genetic mapping of important traits in the parental cultivars.
