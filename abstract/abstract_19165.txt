BACKGROUND
high temperature is a major environmental factor limiting grape yield and affecting berry quality. thermotolerance includes the direct response to heat stress and the ability to recover from heat stress. to better understand the mechanism of the thermotolerance of vitis, we combined a physiological analysis with itraq-based proteomics of vitis vinifera cv cabernet sauvignon, subjected to 43°c for 6 h, and then followed by recovery at 25/18°c.


RESULTS
high temperature increased the concentrations of tbars and inhibited electronic transport in photosynthesis apparatus, indicating that grape leaves were damaged by heat stress. however, these physiological changes rapidly returned to control levels during the subsequent recovery phase from heat stress. one hundred and seventy-four proteins were differentially expressed under heat stress and/or during the recovery phase, in comparison to unstressed controls, respectively. stress and recovery conditions shared  <dig> proteins, while  <dig> and  <dig> proteins were respectively identified under heat stress and recovery conditions alone. based on mapman ontology, functional categories for these dysregulated proteins included mainly photosynthesis , proteins , and stress . the subcellular localization using targetp showed most proteins were located in the chloroplasts , secretory pathways  and mitochondrion .


CONCLUSIONS
on the basis of these findings, we proposed that some proteins related to electron transport chain of photosynthesis, antioxidant enzymes, hsps and other stress response proteins, and glycolysis may play key roles in enhancing grapevine adaptation to and recovery capacity from heat stress. these results provide a better understanding of the proteins involved in, and mechanisms of thermotolerance in grapevines.
