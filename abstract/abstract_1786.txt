BACKGROUND
predicting enzyme active-sites in proteins is an important issue not only for protein sciences but also for a variety of practical applications such as drug design. because enzyme reaction mechanisms are based on the local structures of enzyme active-sites, various template-based methods that compare local structures in proteins have been developed to date. in comparing such local sites, a simple measurement, rmsd, has been used so far.


RESULTS
this paper introduces new machine learning algorithms that refine the similarity/deviation for comparison of local structures. the similarity/deviation is applied to two types of applications, single template analysis and multiple template analysis. in the single template analysis, a single template is used as a query to search proteins for active sites, whereas a protein structure is examined as a query to discover the possible active-sites using a set of templates in the multiple template analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
this paper experimentally illustrates that the machine learning algorithms effectively improve the similarity/deviation measurements for both the analyses.
