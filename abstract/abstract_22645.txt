BACKGROUND
the scarcity of certain nucleic acid species and the small size of target sequences such as mirna, impose a significant barrier to subcellular visualization and present a major challenge to cell biologists. here, we offer a generic and highly sensitive visualization approach  that can be used to detect such nucleic acids using a single-oligonucleotide probe of 19– <dig> nucleotides in length.


RESULTS
we used o-fish to visualize mir146a in human and avian cells. furthermore, we reveal the sensitivity of o-fish detection by using a hiv- <dig> model system to show that as little as 1– <dig> copies of nucleic acids can be detected in a single cell. we were able to discern newly synthesized viral cdna and, moreover, observed that certain hiv rna sequences are only transiently available for o-fish detection.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these results suggest that the o-fish method can potentially be used for in situ probing of, as few as, 1– <dig> copies of nucleic acid and, additionally, to visualize small rna such as mirna. we further propose that the o-fish method could be extended to understand viral function by probing newly transcribed viral intermediates; and discern the localisation of nucleic acids of interest. additionally, interrogating the conformation and structure of a particular nucleic acid in situ might also be possible, based on the accessibility of a target sequence.
