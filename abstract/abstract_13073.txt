BACKGROUND
the orf virus , a zoonotic parapoxvirus, causes pustular skin lesions in small ruminants . intriguingly, orfv can repeatedly infect its host, despite the induction of a specific immunity. these immune modulating and immune evading properties are still unexplained.


RESULTS
here, we describe that orfv infection of permissive cells impairs the intracellular transport of mhc class i molecules  as a result of structural disruption and fragmentation of the golgi apparatus. depending on the duration of infection, we observed a pronounced co-localization of mhc i and cop-i vesicular structures as well as a reduction of mhc i surface expression of up to 50%. these subversion processes are associated with early orfv gene expression and are accompanied by disturbed carbohydrate trimming of post-er mhc i. the mhc i population remaining on the cell surface shows an extended half-life, an effect that might be partially controlled also by late orfv genes.


CONCLUSIONS
the presented data demonstrate that orfv down-regulates mhc i surface expression in infected cells by targeting the late vesicular export machinery and the structure and function of the golgi apparatus, which might aid to escape cellular immune recognition.
