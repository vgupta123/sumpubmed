BACKGROUND
transcriptional networks coordinate adipocyte differentiation and energy metabolism in rodents. the level of fiber and starch in diets with adequate energy content fed to young cattle has the potential to alter intramuscular adipose tissue development in skeletal muscle. post-weaning alterations in gene expression networks driving adipogenesis, lipid filling, and intracellular energy metabolism provide a means to evaluate long-term effects of nutrition on longissimus muscle development across cattle types.


RESULTS
longissimus lumborum  from angus  and angus × simmental  steer calves  fed isonitrogenous high-starch  or low-starch  diets was biopsied at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days of feeding for transcript profiling of  <dig> genes associated with aspects of adipogenesis and energy metabolism. intake of dietary energy  across groups during the study did not differ but feed efficiency  during the first  <dig> days was greater for steers fed his. expression of pparg increased ca. 2-fold by day  <dig> primarily due to his in a × s steers. several potential pparg-target genes  increased  <dig> -to-25-fold by day  <dig> across all groups, with responses  being less pronounced in a × s steers fed los. this latter group of steers had markedly greater blood plasma glucose  and insulin  by day  <dig>  all of which were suggestive of insulin resistance. interactions were observed for fabp <dig>  fasn, gpam, scd, and dgat <dig>  such that feeding a × s steers high-starch and angus steers low-starch resulted in greater fold-changes by day  <dig> or  <dig> . marked up-regulation of insig <dig>  occurred throughout the study across all groups. srebf <dig> expression, however, was only greater on day  <dig> namely due to los in a × s steers. the lipogenic transcription factor thrsp was 6-to-60-fold greater by day  <dig> primarily due to his in a × s steers, constituting the greatest response among all genes.


CONCLUSIONS
results involving gene markers of mature adipocytes  provided evidence of intramuscular adipose tissue differentiation during the early portion of the growing phase. the resulting gene networks underscored a central role for pparg in controlling transcription of genes which are known to co-ordinately regulate adipocyte differentiation and lipid filling in non-ruminants. unlike rodents, insig <dig> appears to play an important role in cattle muscle adipogenesis. we propose that a network of transcription regulators and nuclear receptors including pparg-target genes, insig <dig>  and thrsp, coordinate activation of adipocyte differentiation and lipid filling at an early age.
