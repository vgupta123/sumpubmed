BACKGROUND
endothelial-mesenchymal transition  is a major source of myofibroblast formation in kidney fibrosis. our previous study showed a profibrotic role for matrix metalloproteinase  <dig>  in kidney fibrosis via induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition . inhibition of mmp- <dig> activity reduced kidney fibrosis in murine unilateral ureteral obstruction. this study investigated whether mmp- <dig> also plays a role in endomt in human glomerular endothelial cells.


RESULTS
tgf-β <dig>  induced endomt in hkgecs as shown by morphological changes. in addition, ve-cadherin and cd <dig> were significantly downregulated, whereas α-sma, vimentin, and n-cadherin were upregulated. rt-pcr revealed that snail, a known inducer of emt, was upregulated. the mmp inhibitor gm <dig> abrogated tgf-β1-induced endomt. zymography indicated that mmp- <dig> was also upregulated in tgf-β1-treated hkgecs. recombinant mmp- <dig>  induced endomt in hkgecs via notch signaling, as evidenced by increased formation of the notch intracellular domain  and decreased notch  <dig>  inhibition of mmp- <dig> activity by its inhibitor showed a dose-dependent response in preventing tgf-β1-induced α-sma and nicd in hkgecs, whereas inhibition of notch signaling by γ-secretase inhibitor  blocked rmmp-9-induced endomt.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our results demonstrate that mmp- <dig> plays an important role in tgf-β1-induced endomt via upregulation of notch signaling in hkgecs.
