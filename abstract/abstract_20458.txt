BACKGROUND
the rasd <dig> protein is a dexamethasone induced monomeric ras-like g protein that oscillates in the suprachiasmatic nucleus . previous studies have shown that rasd <dig> modulates multiple signaling cascades. however, it is still unclear exactly how rasd <dig> carries out its function. studying protein-protein interactions involving rasd <dig> may provide insights into its biological functions in different contexts.


RESULTS
to further explore the molecular function of rasd <dig>  we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified ear <dig>  a negative regulator of renin transcription, as an interaction partner of rasd <dig>  we validated the interaction in vitro and in transfected cos- <dig> cells. we further confirmed the interaction of endogenous rasd <dig> and ear <dig> from hek293t cell and mouse brain extract. rasd <dig> inhibited transcriptional repression by ear <dig> on a renin promoter-luciferase reporter construct both in the presence and absence of all-trans-retinoic acid. moreover, real-time rt-pcr showed upregulation of endogenous renin transcription in as <dig>  cells over-expressing rasd <dig>  we demonstrated that the ligand binding domain of ear <dig> is required for physical and functional interaction between the two proteins. in addition, we demonstrated that shrna-mediated knockdown of rasd <dig> results in further repression of ear2-mediated renin transcription, whereas induction of rasd <dig> by dexamethasone counteracts the effects of shrna-mediated rasd <dig> knockdown. finally, our study showed that rasd <dig> missense mutations not only attenuate their physical interaction with ear <dig> but also abolish their ability to counteract repression of renin transcription mediated by ear <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our study provides evidence for physical and functional interactions between rasd <dig> and ear <dig>  the results suggest that their interactions are involved in renin transcriptional regulation. these findings not only reveal a novel role for rasd1-medated signaling but also provide the basis for potential intervention of renin expression.
