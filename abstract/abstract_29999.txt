BACKGROUND
the internalization of aspergillus fumigatus into alveolar epithelial cells  is tightly controlled by host cellular actin dynamics, which require close modulation of the adf /cofilin family. however, the role of cofilin in a. fumigatus internalization into aecs remains unclear.


RESULTS
here, we demonstrated that germinated a. fumigatus conidia were able to induce phosphorylation of cofilin in a <dig> cells during the early stage of internalization. the modulation of cofilin activity by overexpression, knockdown, or mutation of the cofilin gene in a <dig> cells decreased the efficacy of a. fumigatus internalization. reducing the phosphorylation status of cofilin with bms- <dig>  or overexpression of the slingshot phosphatases also impeded a. fumigatus internalization. both the c. botulimun c <dig> transferase  and y <dig>  reduced the internalization of a. fumigatus and the level of phosphorylated cofilin. β- <dig> -glucan  and its host cell receptor dectin- <dig> did not seem to be associated with cofilin phosphorylation during a. fumigatus infection.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicated that cofilin might be involved in the modulation of a. fumigatus internalization into type ii alveolar epithelial cells through the rhoa-rock-lim kinase pathway.
