BACKGROUND
it is well known that brewer’s yeast affects the taste and aroma of beer. however, the influence of brewer’s yeast on the protein composition of beer is currently unknown. in this study, changes of the proteome of immature beer, i.e. beer that has not been matured after fermentation, by ale brewer’s yeast strains with different abilities to degrade fermentable sugars were investigated.


RESULTS
beers were fermented from standard hopped wort  using two ale brewer’s yeast  strains with different attenuation degrees. both immature beers had the same alcohol and protein concentrations. immature beer and unfermented wort proteins were analysed by 2-de and compared in order to determine protein changes arising from fermentation. distinct protein spots in the beer and wort proteomes were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  and ms/ms and revealed common beer proteins, such as lipid transfer proteins , protein z and amylase-protease inhibitors. during fermentation, two protein spots, corresponding to ltp <dig>  disappeared, while three protein spots were exclusively found in beer. these three proteins, all derived from yeast, were identified as cell wall associated proteins, that is exg <dig> , bgl <dig> , and uth <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
yeast strain dependent changes in the immature beer proteome were identified, i.e. bgl <dig> was present in beer brewed with kvl <dig>  while lacking in wlp <dig> beer.
