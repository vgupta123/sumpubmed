BACKGROUND
as fish eaters bottlenose dolphins  in human care need to receive daily vitamin supplementation, because whole thawed fish lacks certain vitamins. however, the exact concentration of supplementation has not been established and is a matter of discussion. to ensure adequate vitamin supplementation in pets, vitamin blood concentrations are measured. this is not a common practice in dolphins. the objective of the present study was to collect information about vitamin supplementation in bottlenose dolphins and on vitamin blood concentrations of healthy animals in european facilities. in addition, these results were compared with blood levels of wild animals. conclusions on how to provide bottlenose dolphins in human care with an effective vitamin supplementation will then be drawn.

initially, fish-handling techniques and vitamin supplementation were evaluated by questionnaire, which was sent to  <dig> european facilities that house bottlenose dolphins. secondly, blood samples from  <dig> dolphins living in  <dig> facilities were taken and sent by mail to a reference laboratory. they were analysed for retinol, thiamine pyrophosphate, cobalamin, calcidiol and tocopherol. the blood concentrations were then correlated with vitamin supplementation, fish handling techniques and pre-existing blood concentrations of free-ranging dolphins. finally, the data was subjected to a standard analysis of variance techniques  and a linear model analysis.


RESULTS
fish was mainly thawed in a refrigerator. further, the 95 % confidence interval for retinol blood concentrations was  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/l and for tocopherol  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/l. these concentrations were  <dig> and 53 %, respectively, higher than those found in free-ranging animals. in contrast, calcidiol concentrations  of the dolphins in human care were lower than in blood found for free-ranging animals. regarding thiamine pyrophosphate and cobalamin, concentrations ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  and  <dig>  pg/ml respectively. no reference concentrations for free-ranging tursiops truncatus were found.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest an over-supplementation of retinol  and tocopherol  in bottlenose dolphins  housed in human care. therefore, vitamin a supplementation should not exceed  <dig>  iu per animal per day and vitamin e supplementation should be around 100 iu per kg fed fish per day.
