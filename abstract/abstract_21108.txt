BACKGROUND
aplastic anemia  is a bone marrow failure syndrome mostly characterized by an immune-mediated destruction of marrow hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells. the resulting hypocellularity limits a detailed analysis of the cellular immune response. to overcome this technical problem we performed a microarray analysis of cd3+ t-cells derived from bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood samples of newly diagnosed aa patients and healthy volunteers. two aa patients were additionally analyzed after achieving a partial remission following immunosuppression. the regulation of selected candidate genes was confirmed by real-time rt-pcr.


RESULTS
among more than  <dig>  transcripts,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in the bone marrow of aa patients compared to healthy controls. dysregulated genes are involved in t-cell mediated cytotoxicity, immune response of th <dig> differentiated t-cells, and major regulators of immune function. in hematological remission the expression levels of several candidate genes tend to normalize, such as immune regulators and genes involved in proinflammatory immune response.


CONCLUSIONS
our study suggests a pivotal role of th1/tc <dig> differentiated t-cells in immune-mediated marrow destruction of aa patients. most importantly, immune regulatory genes could be identified, which are likely involved in the recovery of hematopoiesis and may help to design new therapeutic strategies in bone marrow failure syndromes.
