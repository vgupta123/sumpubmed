BACKGROUND
a sensitive, ubiquitously expressed tetracycline inducible system would be a valuable tool in mouse transgenesis. however, this has been difficult to obtain due to position effects observed at different chromosomal sites of transgene integration, which negatively affect expression in many tissues. the aim of this study was to test the utility of a mammalian methylation-free cpg island to drive ubiquitous expression of the sensitive doxycycline  inducible rtta2s-m <dig> tet-transactivator in transgenic mice.


RESULTS
an  <dig> kb genomic fragment from the methylation-free cpg island of the human hnrnpa2b1-cbx <dig> housekeeping gene locus was tested. in a number of transgenic mouse lines obtained, rtta2s-m <dig> expression was detected in many tissues examined. characterisation of the highest expressing rtta2s-m <dig> transgenic mouse line demonstrated dox-inducible gfp transgene expression in many tissues. using this line we also show highly sensitive quantitative induction with low doses of dox of an assayable plasma protein transgene under the control of a tet responsive element . the utility of this rtta2s-m <dig> line for inducible expression in mouse embryos was also demonstrated using a gata- <dig> tet-inducible transgene to show specific phenotypes in the embryonic lung, as well as broader effects resulting from the inducible widespread overexpression of the transgene.


CONCLUSIONS
the ubiquitously expressing rtta2s-m <dig> transgenic mouse line described here provides a very useful tool for studying the effects of the widespread, inducible overexpression of genes during embryonic development and in adult mice.
