BACKGROUND
clostridium botulinum strains that produce botulinum neurotoxin type e  are most commonly isolated from botulism cases, marine environments, and animals in regions of high latitude in the northern hemisphere. a strain of c. botulinum type e  was isolated from soil in chubut, argentina. previous studies showed that the amino acid sequences of bont/e produced by various strains differ by < 6% and that the type e neurotoxin gene cluster inserts into the rara operon.


RESULTS
genetic and mass spectral analysis demonstrated that the bont/e produced by cdc <dig> is a novel toxin subtype . toxin gene sequencing indicated that bont/e <dig> differed by nearly 11% at the amino acid level compared to bont/e <dig>  mass spectrometric analysis of bont/e <dig> revealed that its endopeptidase substrate cleavage site was identical to other bont/e subtypes. further analysis of this strain demonstrated that its 16s rrna sequence clustered with other group ii c. botulinum  strains. genomic dna isolated from strain cdc <dig> hybridized with fewer probes using a group ii c. botulinum subtyping microarray compared to other type e strains examined. whole genome shotgun sequencing of strain cdc <dig> revealed that while the toxin gene cluster inserted into the rara operon similar to other type e strains, its overall genome content shared greater similarity with a group ii c. botulinum type b strain .


CONCLUSIONS
these results expand our understanding of the global distribution of c. botulinum type e strains and suggest that the type e toxin gene cluster may be able to insert into c. botulinum strains with a more diverse genetic background than previously recognized.
