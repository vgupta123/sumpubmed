BACKGROUND
it has been recognized that phospholipase a <dig>  is a crucial component of snake venom, which contributes greatly to snake venom induced inflammation in man. however, the mechanisms through which n <dig> pla <dig> provoke inflammation remain unclear. recently, a n <dig> pla <dig>  tm-n <dig> from protobothrops mucrosquamatus crude venom was characterized in our laboratory. since the purification procedure developed is able to supply us with relatively large quantity of highly purified tm-n <dig>  we investigated the ability of tm-n <dig> in induction of inflammation.


RESULTS
the results showed that tm-n <dig> provoked a dose dependent increase in microvascular leakage in the skin of rats. the potency of tm-n <dig> in induction of skin edema appeared similar potency of bradykinin and histamine. pretreatment of rats with compound 48/ <dig> diminished tm-n <dig> induced skin reaction and reduced mast cell numbers in rats. ginkgolide b and cyproheptadine, but not terfenadine and quinacrine, inhibited tm-n <dig> elicited microvascular leakage when they were co-injected with the stimulus to rat skin. moreover, tm-n <dig> was found to induce histamine release from human colon, lung and tonsil mast cells, and both metabolic inhibitors and pertussis toxin were capable of inhibiting tm-n <dig> elicited histamine release. tm-n <dig> induced mast cell accumulation in the peritoneum of mice, which was inhibited by co-injection of ginkgolide b, cyproheptadine and terfenadine. intravenous injection of monoclonal antibodies against cd <dig>  icam- <dig> and cd11a also blocked tm-n <dig> induced mast cell accumulation.


CONCLUSIONS
tm-n <dig> is a potent stimulus for skin edema, mast cell activation and accumulation.
