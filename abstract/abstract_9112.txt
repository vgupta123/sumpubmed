BACKGROUND
the forkhead transcription factor gene e <dig>  plays an important role in regulation of thyroid development, palate formation and hair morphogenesis in mammals. however, avian foxe <dig> genes have not been characterized and as such, codon evolution of foxe <dig> orthologs in a broader evolutionary context of mammals and birds is not known.


RESULTS
in this study we identified the avian foxe <dig> gene in chicken, turkey and zebra finch, all of which consist of a single exon. chicken and zebra finch foxe <dig> are uniquely located on the sex-determining z chromosome. in situ hybridization shows that chicken foxe <dig> is specifically expressed in the developing thyroid. its expression is initiated at the placode stage and is maintained during the stages of vesicle formation and follicle primordia. based on this expression pattern, we propose that avian foxe <dig> may be involved in regulating the evagination and morphogenesis of thyroid. chicken foxe <dig> is also expressed in growing feathers. sequence analysis identified two microdeletions in the avian foxe <dig> genes, corresponding to the loss of a transferable repression domain and an engrailed homology motif  <dig>  c-terminal to the forkhead domain. the avian foxe <dig> proteins exhibit a significant sequence divergence of the c-terminus compared to those of amphibian and mammalian foxe <dig>  the codon evolution analysis  of foxe <dig> shows a significantly increased dn/ds ratio in the avian lineages, consistent with either a relaxed purifying selection or positive selection on a few residues in avian foxe <dig> evolution. further site specific analysis indicates that while relaxed purifying selection is likely to be a predominant cause of accelerated evolution at the 3'-region of avian foxe <dig>  a few residues might have evolved under positive selection.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified three avian foxe <dig> genes based on synteny and sequence similarity as well as characterized the expression pattern of the chicken foxe <dig> gene during development. our evolutionary analyses suggest that while a relaxed purifying selection is likely to be the dominant force driving accelerated evolution of avian foxe <dig> genes, a few residues may have evolved adaptively. this study provides a basis for future genetic and comparative biochemical studies of foxe <dig>
