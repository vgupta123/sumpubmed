BACKGROUND
apoer <dig> and the neurotrophin receptors trk and p75ntr are expressed in the cns and regulate key functional aspects of neurons, including development, survival, and neuronal function. it is known that both apoer <dig> and p75ntr are processed by metalloproteinases, followed by regulated intramembrane proteolysis. trka activation by nerve growth factor  increases the proteolytic processing of p75ntr mediated by adam <dig>  reelin induces the sheeding of apoer <dig> ectodomain depending on metalloproteinase activity. however, it is not known if there is a common regulation mechanism for processing these receptors.


RESULTS
we found that trka activation by ngf in pc <dig> cells induced apoer <dig> processing, which was dependent on trka activation and metalloproteinases. ngf-induced apoer <dig> proteolysis was independent of mitogen activated protein kinase activity and of phosphatidylinositol- <dig> kinase activity. in contrast, the basal proteolysis of apoer <dig> increased when both kinases were pharmacologically inhibited. the apoer <dig> ligand reelin regulated the proteolytic processing of its own receptor but not of p75ntr. finally, in primary cortical neurons, which express both apoer <dig> and trkb, we found that the proteolysis of apoer <dig> was also regulated by brain-derived growth factor .


CONCLUSIONS
our results highlight a novel relationship between neurotrophins and the reelin-apoer <dig> system, suggesting that these two pathways might be linked to regulate brain development, neuronal survival, and some pathological conditions.
