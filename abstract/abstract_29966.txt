BACKGROUND
with the accelerating development of bioscience, the problem of research cost has become important. we previously devised and developed a novel concept microarray with manageable volumes  using a soft gel. it demonstrated the great potential of the mmv technology with the examples of 1024-parallel-cell culture and pcr experiments. however, its full potential failed to be expressed, owing to the nature of the material used for the mmv chip.


RESULTS
in the present study, by developing plastic-based mmvs and associated technologies, we introduced novel technologies such as c2d2p , ngs-non-dependent microbiome analysis, and other powerful applications.


CONCLUSIONS
the reborn mmv-microarray technology has proven to be highly efficient and cost-effective  and enables us to realize hitherto unattainable technologies.
