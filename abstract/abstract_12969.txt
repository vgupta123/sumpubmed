BACKGROUND
cullin-ring ubiquitin e <dig> ligases  are regulated by modification of an ubiquitin-like protein, nedd <dig>  on the cullin subunit. neddylation is shown to facilitate e <dig> complex assembly; while un-neddylated cullins are bound by cand <dig> that prevents recruitment of the substrates. the level of nedd <dig> modification is critically dependent on the cop <dig> signalosome , an eight-subunit protein complex containing nedd <dig> isopeptidase activity.


RESULTS
we report isolation of sap <dig>  as a csn <dig> interacting protein. sap <dig> is homologous to ddb <dig>  and is a component of sf3b rna splicing complex and staga/tftc transcription complexes, but its specific function within these complexes is unknown. we show that sap <dig> can interact with a variety of cullin proteins. it forms tertiary complexes with fully assembled crl e <dig> complexes such as scfskp <dig>  elongin b/c -cul2- vhl and cul4-ddb complex by binding to both n-terminal and c-terminal domain of cullins. sap <dig> preferentially associates with neddylated cullins in vivo. however knock-down of cand <dig> abolished this preference and increased association of sap <dig> with cul <dig>  furthermore, we provide evidence that csn regulates sap130-cul <dig> interaction and sap130-associated polyubiquitinating activity.


CONCLUSIONS
sap <dig> is a cullin binding protein that is likely involved in the nedd <dig> pathway. the association of sap <dig> with various cullin member proteins such as cul <dig>  cul <dig> and cul4a is modulated by cand <dig> and csn. as an established component of transcription and rna processing complexes, we hypothesis that sap <dig> may link crl mediated ubiquitination to gene expression.
