BACKGROUND
there is increasing evidence of a pivotal role for regulated mrna translation in control of developmental cell fate transitions. physiological and pathological stem and progenitor cell self-renewal is maintained by the mrna-binding protein, musashi <dig> through repression of translation of key mrnas encoding cell cycle inhibitory proteins. the mechanism by which musashi <dig> function is modified to allow translation of these target mrnas under conditions that require inhibition of cell cycle progression, is unknown.


RESULTS
in this study, we demonstrate that differentiation of primary embryonic rat neural stem/progenitor cells  or human neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cells results in the rapid phosphorylation of musashi <dig> on the evolutionarily conserved site serine  <dig> . phosphorylation of this site has been shown to be required for cell cycle control during the maturation of xenopus oocytes. s <dig> phosphorylation in mammalian nspcs and human sh-sy5y cells correlates with the de-repression and translation of a musashi reporter mrna and with accumulation of protein from the endogenous musashi target mrna, p21waf1/cip <dig>  inhibition of musashi regulatory phosphorylation, through expression of a phospho-inhibitory mutant musashi <dig> s337a or over-expression of the wild-type musashi, blocked differentiation of both nspcs and sh-sy5y cells. musashi <dig> was similarly phosphorylated in nspcs and sh-sy5y cells under conditions of nutrient deprivation-induced cell cycle arrest. expression of the musashi <dig> s337a mutant protein attenuated nutrient deprivation-induced nspc and sh-sy5y cell death.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that in response to environmental cues that oppose cell cycle progression, regulation of musashi function is required to promote target mrna translation and cell fate transition. forced modulation of musashi <dig> function may present a novel therapeutic strategy to oppose pathological stem cell self-renewal.
