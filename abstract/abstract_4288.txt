BACKGROUND
rna-seq and its variant differential rna-seq  are today routine methods for transcriptome analysis in bacteria. while expression profiling and transcriptional start site prediction are standard tasks today, the problem of identifying transcriptional units in a genome-wide fashion is still not solved for prokaryotic systems.


RESULTS
we present rnaseg, an algorithm for the prediction of transcriptional units based on drna-seq data. a key feature of the algorithm is that, based on the data, it distinguishes between transcribed and un-transcribed genomic segments. furthermore, the program provides many different predictions in a single run, which can be used to infer the significance of transcriptional units in a consensus procedure. we show the performance of our method based on a well-studied drna-seq data set for helicobacter pylori.


CONCLUSIONS
with our algorithm it is possible to identify operons and 5’- and 3’-utrs in an automated fashion. this alleviates the need for labour intensive manual inspection and enables large-scale studies in the area of comparative transcriptomics.
