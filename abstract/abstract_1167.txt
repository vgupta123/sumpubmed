BACKGROUND
the presence of four mammalian cell entry  operons in mycobacterium tuberculosis suggests the essentiality of the functions of the genes in these operons. the differential expression of the four mce operons in different phases of in vitro growth and in infected animals reported earlier from our laboratory further justifies the apparent redundancy for these genes in the genome.

here we investigate the extent of polymorphism in eight genes in the mce <dig> and mce <dig> operons of m. tuberculosis from four standard reference strains  and bcg) and  <dig> clinical isolates varying in their drug susceptibility profile, analysed by direct sequencing and sequenom massarray platform.


RESULTS
we discovered  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the two operons. the comparative analysis of the genes of mce <dig> and mce <dig> operons revealed that yrbe1a  was most polymorphic in mce <dig> operon while yrbe4a  and lprn  had the highest number of snps in the mce <dig> operon. of  <dig> snps,  <dig> were found to be nonsynonymous and were further analysed for their pathological relevance to m. tuberculosis using web servers polyphen and pmut, which predicted five deleterious nonsynonymous snps. a mutation from proline to serine at position  <dig> of the native mce1a protein was most deleterious as predicted by both polyphen and pmut servers. energy minimization of the structure of native mce1a protein and mutated protein was performed using insightii. the mutated mce1a protein showed structural changes that could account for the effects of this mutation.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that snps in the coding sequences of mce <dig> and mce <dig> operons in clinical isolates can be significantly high. moreover, mce <dig> operon is significantly more polymorphic than mce <dig> operon . however, the frequency of nonsynonymous substitutions is higher in mce <dig> operon and synonymous substitutions are more in mce <dig> operon. in silico modeling predict that nonsynonymous snp at mce1a , a virulence gene could play a pivotal role in causing functional changes in m. tuberculosis that may reflect upon the biology of the bacteria.
