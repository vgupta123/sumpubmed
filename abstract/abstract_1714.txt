BACKGROUND
heat-shock transcription factor  <dig>  mutations are associated with autosomal dominant lamellar cataract and marner cataract. disruptions of the hsf <dig> gene cause lens defects in mice, indicating a requirement for hsf <dig> in fiber cell differentiation during lens development. however, neither the relationship between hsf <dig> and crystallins nor the detailed mechanism of maintenance of lens transparency by hsf <dig> is fully understood.


RESULTS
in an attempt to determine how the underlying biomedical and physiological mechanisms resulting from loss of hsf <dig> contribute to cataract formation, we generated an hsf <dig> knockout mouse model. we showed that the hsf <dig> knockout mouse  partially mimics the human cataract caused by hsf <dig> mutations. q-pcr analysis revealed down-regulation of several cataract-relevant genes, including γs-crystallin  and lens-specific beaded filament proteins  <dig> and  <dig> , in the lens of the hsf4-/- mouse. transcription activity analysis using the dual-luciferase system suggested that these cataract-relevant genes are the direct downstream targets of hsf <dig>  the effect of hsf <dig> on γs-crystallin is exemplified by the cataractogenesis seen in the hsf4-/-,rncat intercross. the 2d electrophoretic analysis of whole-lens lysates revealed a different expression pattern in 8-week-old hsf4-/- mice compared with their wild-type counterparts, including the loss of some αa-crystallin modifications and reduced expression of γ-crystallin proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that hsf <dig> is sufficiently important to lens development and disruption of the hsf <dig> gene leads to cataracts via at least three pathways: 1) down-regulation of γ-crystallin, particularly γs-crystallin; 2) decreased lens beaded filament expression; and 3) loss of post-translational modification of αa-crystallin.
