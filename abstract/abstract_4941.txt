BACKGROUND
pertussis toxin  is an exotoxin virulence factor produced by bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough. pt consists of an active subunit  that adp-ribosylates the alpha subunit of several mammalian g proteins, and a b oligomer  that binds glycoconjugate receptors on cells. pt appears to enter cells by endocytosis, and retrograde transport through the golgi apparatus may be important for its cytotoxicity. a previous study demonstrated that proteolytic processing of s <dig> occurs after pt enters mammalian cells. we sought to determine whether this proteolytic processing of s <dig> is necessary for pt cytotoxicity.


RESULTS
protease inhibitor studies suggested that s <dig> processing may involve a metalloprotease, and processing does not involve furin, a mammalian cell protease that cleaves several other bacterial toxins. however, inhibitor studies showed a general lack of correlation of s <dig> processing with pt cellular activity. a combination of replacement, insertion and deletion mutations in the c-terminal region of s <dig>  as well as mass spectrometry data, suggested that the cleavage site is located around residue 203â€“ <dig>  but that cleavage is not strongly sequence-dependent. processing of s <dig> was abolished by each of  <dig> overlapping  <dig> residue deletions just downstream of the putative cleavage site, but not by smaller deletions in the same region. processing of the various mutant forms of pt did not correlate with cellular activity of the toxin, nor with the ability of the bacteria producing them to infect the mouse respiratory tract. in addition, s <dig> processing was not detected in transfected cells expressing s <dig>  even though s <dig> was fully active in these cells.


CONCLUSIONS
s <dig> processing is not essential for the cellular activity of pt. this distinguishes it from the processing of various other bacterial toxins, which has been shown to be important for their cytotoxicity. s <dig> processing may be mediated primarily by a metalloprotease, but the cleavage site on s <dig> is not sequence-dependent and processing appears to depend on the general topology of the protein in that region, indicating that multiple proteases may contribute to this cleavage.
