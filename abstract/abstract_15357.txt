BACKGROUND
specific cell targeting is an important, yet unsolved problem in bacteria-based therapeutic applications, like tumor or gene therapy. here, we describe the construction of a novel, internalin a and b -deficient listeria monocytogenes strain , which expresses protein a of staphylococcus aureus  and anchors spa in the correct orientation on the bacterial cell surface.


RESULTS
this listerial strain efficiently binds antibodies allowing specific interaction of the bacterium with the target recognized by the antibody. binding of trastuzumab  or cetuximab  to lm-spa+, two clinically approved monoclonal antibodies directed against her2/neu and egfr/her <dig>  respectively, triggers inlab-independent internalization into non-phagocytic cancer cell lines overexpressing the respective receptors. internalization, subsequent escape into the host cell cytosol and intracellular replication of these bacteria are as efficient as of the corresponding inlab-positive, spa-negative parental strain. this specific antibody/receptor-mediated internalization of lm-spa+ is shown in the murine 4t <dig> tumor cell line, the isogenic 4t1-her <dig> cell line as well as the human cancer cell lines sk-br- <dig> and sk-ov- <dig>  importantly, this targeting approach is applicable in a xenograft mouse tumor model after crosslinking the antibody to spa on the listerial cell surface.


CONCLUSIONS
binding of receptor-specific antibodies to spa-expressing l. monocytogenes may represent a promising approach to target l. monocytogenes to host cells expressing specific receptors triggering internalization.
