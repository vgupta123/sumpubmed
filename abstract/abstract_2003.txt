BACKGROUND
every cell of the mammalian organism needs iron as trace element in numerous oxido-reductive processes as well as for transport and storage of oxygen. the very versatility of ionic iron makes it a toxic entity which can catalyze the production of radicals that damage vital membranous and macromolecular assemblies in the cell. the mammalian organism maintains therefore a complex regulatory network of iron uptake, excretion and intra-body distribution. intracellular regulation in different cell types is intertwined with a global hormonal signalling structure. iron deficiency as well as excess of iron are frequent and serious human disorders. they can affect every cell, but also the organism as a whole.


RESULTS
here, we present a kinematic model of the dynamic system of iron pools and fluxes. it is based on ferrokinetic data and chemical measurements in c57bl <dig> wild-type mice maintained on iron-deficient, iron-adequate, or iron-loaded diet. the tracer iron levels in major tissues and organs  were followed for  <dig> days. the evaluation resulted in a whole-body model of fractional clearance rates. the analysis permits calculation of absolute flux rates in the steady-state, of iron distribution into different organs, of tracer-accessible pool sizes and of residence times of iron in the different compartments in response to three states of iron-repletion induced by the dietary regime.


CONCLUSIONS
this mathematical model presents a comprehensive physiological picture of mice under three different diets with varying iron contents. the quantitative results reflect systemic properties of iron metabolism: dynamic closedness, hierarchy of time scales, switch-over response and dynamics of iron storage in parenchymal organs.

therefore, we could assess which parameters will change under dietary perturbations and study in quantitative terms when those changes take place.
