BACKGROUND
velo-cardio-facial syndrome/digeorge syndrome  is caused by a  <dig> -3Â mb microdeletion of chromosome 22q <dig> , frequently referred to as 22q <dig>  deletion syndrome . this region includes tbx <dig>  a t-box transcription factor gene that contributes to the etiology of 22q11ds. the requirement for tbx <dig> in mammalian development is dosage-sensitive, such that loss-of-function  and gain-of-function  of tbx <dig> in both mice and humans results in disease relevant congenital malformations.


RESULTS
to further gain insight into the role of tbx <dig> in development, we have targeted the rosa <dig> locus to generate a new gof mouse model in which a tbx1-gfp fusion protein is expressed conditionally using the cre/loxp system. tbx1-gfp expression is driven by the endogenous rosa <dig> promoter resulting in ectopic and persistent expression. tbx <dig> is pivotal for proper ear and heart development; ectopic activation of tbx1-gfp in the otic vesicle by pax2-cre and foxg1-cre represses neurogenesis and produces morphological defects of the inner ear. overexpression of a single copy of tbx1-gfp using tbx1cre/+ was viable, while overexpression of both copies resulted in neonatal lethality with cardiac outflow tract defects. we have partially rescued inner ear and heart anomalies in tbx1cre/- null embryos by expression of tbx1-gfp.


CONCLUSIONS
we have generated a new mouse model to conditionally overexpress a gfp-tagged tbx <dig> protein in vivo. this provides a useful tool to investigate in vivo direct downstream targets and protein binding partners of tbx <dig>
