BACKGROUND
glycine soja is a wild relative of soybean that has purple flowers. no flower color variant of glycine soja has been found in the natural habitat.


RESULTS
b <dig>  an accession with light purple flowers, was discovered in southern japan. genetic analysis revealed that the gene responsible for the light purple flowers was allelic to the w <dig> locus encoding flavonoid 3'5'-hydroxylase . the new allele was designated as w1-lp. the dominance relationship of the locus was w <dig> >w1-lp >w <dig>  one f <dig> plant and four f <dig> plants with purple flowers were generated in the cross between b <dig> and a clark near-isogenic line with w <dig> allele. flower petals of b <dig> contained lower amounts of four major anthocyanins  common in purple flowers and contained small amounts of the 5'-unsubstituted versions of the above anthocyanins, peonidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside, cyanidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside and cyanidin 3-o-glucoside, suggesting that f3'5'h activity was reduced and flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase activity was increased. f3'5'h cdnas were cloned from clark and b <dig> by rt-pcr. the cdna of b <dig> had a unique base substitution resulting in the substitution of valine with methionine at amino acid position  <dig>  the base substitution was ascertained by dcaps analysis. the polymorphism associated with the dcaps markers co-segregated with flower color in the f <dig> population. f <dig> progeny test, and dcaps and indel analyses suggested that the plants with purple flowers might be due to intragenic recombination and that the  <dig> bp insertion responsible for gene dysfunction might have been eliminated in such plants.


CONCLUSIONS
b <dig> may be the first example of a flower color variant found in nature. the light purple flower was controlled by a new allele of the w <dig> locus encoding f3'5'h. the flower petals contained unique anthocyanins not found in soybean and g. soja. b <dig> may be a useful tool for studies of the structural and functional properties of f3'5'h genes as well as investigations on the role of flower color in relation to adaptation of g. soja to natural habitats.
