BACKGROUND
shark heavy chain antibody, also called new antigen receptor , consists of one single variable domain , containing only two complementarity-determining regions . the antigen binding affinity and specificity are mainly determined by these two cdrs. the good solubility, excellent thermal stability and complex sequence variation of small single domain antibodies  make them attractive alternatives to conventional antibodies. in this report, we construct and characterize a diversity enhanced semi-synthetic nar v display library based on naturally occurring nar v sequences.


RESULTS
a semi-synthetic shark sdab display library with a complexity close to 1e <dig> was constructed. this was achieved by introducing size and sequence variations in cdr <dig> using randomized cdr <dig> primers of three different lengths. binders against three toxins, staphylococcal enterotoxin b , ricin, and botulinum toxin a  complex toxoid, were isolated from panning the display library. soluble sdabs from selected binders were purified and evaluated using direct binding and thermal stability assays on the luminex  <dig>  in addition, sandwich assays using sdab as the reporter element were developed to demonstrate their utility for future sensor applications.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated the utility of a newly created hyper diversified shark nar displayed library to serve as a source of thermal stable sdabs against a variety of toxins.
