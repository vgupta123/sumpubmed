BACKGROUND
relatively recent evidence indicates that abcc <dig> transporters play a main role in the mode of action of bacillus thuringiensis  cry1a-type proteins. mapping of major cry1a resistance genes has linked resistance to the abcc <dig> locus in heliothis virescens, plutella xylostella, trichoplusia ni and bombyx mori, and mutations in this gene have been found in three of these bt-resistant strains.


RESULTS
we have used a colony of spodoptera exigua  highly resistant to a bt commercial bioinsecticide to identify regions in the s. exigua genome containing loci for major resistance genes by using bulk segregant analysis . results reveal a region containing three genes from the abcc family  and a mutation in one of them  as responsible for the resistance of s. exigua to the bt commercial product and to its key spodoptera-active ingredients, cry1ca. in contrast to all previously described mutations in abcc <dig> genes that directly or indirectly affect the extracellular domains of the membrane protein, the abcc <dig> mutation found in s. exigua affects an intracellular domain involved in atp binding. functional analyses of abbc <dig> and abbc <dig> support the role of both proteins in the mode of action of bt toxins in s. exigua. partial silencing of these genes with dsrna decreased the susceptibility of wild type larvae to both cry1ac and cry1ca. in addition, reduction of abbc <dig> and abbc <dig> expression negatively affected some fitness components and induced up-regulation of arylphorin and repat <dig>  genes that respond to bt intoxication and that are found constitutively up-regulated in the xen-r strain.


CONCLUSIONS
the current results show the involvement of different members of the abcc family in the mode of action of b. thuringiensis proteins and expand the role of the abcc <dig> transporter in b. thuringiensis resistance beyond the cry1a family of proteins to include cry1ca.
