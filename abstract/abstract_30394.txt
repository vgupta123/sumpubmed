BACKGROUND
btbd <dig> binds to akt and protein phosphatase 2a  and inhibits the pp2a-mediated dephosphorylation of akt, thereby keeping akt activated. previous studies have suggested that btbd <dig> plays an important role in preventing motor neuronal death and accelerating the growth of pancreatic beta cells. because levels of btbd <dig> expression are much lower in many non-nervous tissues than nervous tissues, there may be a relative of btbd <dig> that has btbd10-like function in non-neuronal cells.


RESULTS
a 419-amino-acid btbd10-like protein, named kctd <dig> , was to found to bind to all akt isoforms and pp2a. overexpression of kctd <dig> increased akt phosphorylation at thr <dig>  as btbd <dig> did, which suggests that kctd <dig> as well as btbd <dig> positively regulates the function of akt. kctd <dig> was ubiquitously expressed in non-nervous as well as nervous tissues.


CONCLUSIONS
kctd <dig> is a positive regulator of akt and may play an important role in regulating the death and growth of some non-nervous and nervous cells.
