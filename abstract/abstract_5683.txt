BACKGROUND
like emotional symptoms such as anxiety, modulations in working memory are among the frequently-reported but controversial psychiatric symptoms associated with nicotine  administration. in the present study, repeated nc-induced modulations in working memory, along with concurrently-observed anxiety-related behavioral alterations, were investigated in mice, and compared with the effects of a typical cognition-impairing stressor, immobilization stress . furthermore, considering the structural and functional contributions of brain cannabinoid  receptors in nc-induced psychiatric symptoms including emotional symptoms, the interactive effects of brain cb receptor ligands  and nc and/or im on the working memory- and anxiety-related behaviors were examined.


RESULTS
statistically significant working memory impairment-like behavioral alterations in the y-maze test and anxiety-like behavioral alterations in the elevated plus-maze  test were observed in the groups of mice treated with  <dig>  mg/kg nc   <dig>  mg/kg treatment,  <dig> days) and/or im . in the group of mice treated with nc plus im , an enhancement of the behavioral alterations was observed. among the cb type  <dig>  antagonist am  <dig> , the non-selective cb agonist cp  <dig>  , and the cb <dig> partial agonist/antagonist virodhamine , significant recovering effects were provided by am  and vd  against the working memory impairment-like behaviors, whereas significant anxiolytic-like effects  were provided by vd  and cp  against the anxiety-like behaviors.


CONCLUSIONS
although working memory impairment- and anxiety-like behavioral alterations were commonly induced in the nc, im, and nc-im groups and the therapeutic involvement of cb receptors was shown, there were discrepancies in the types of effective cb ligands between the working memory- and anxiety-related behaviors. the differential involvements of cb receptor subtypes and indirectly activated neurotransmitter systems may contribute to these discrepancies.
