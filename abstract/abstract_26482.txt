BACKGROUND
external ripening in citrus fruits is morphologically characterized by a colour shift from green to orange due to the degradation of chlorophylls and the accumulation of carotenoid pigments. although numerous genes coding for enzymes involved in such biochemical pathways have been identified, the molecular control of this process has been scarcely studied. in this work we used the citrus clementina mutants 39b <dig> and 39e <dig>  showing delayed colour break, to isolate genes potentially related to the regulation of peel ripening and its physiological or biochemical effects.


RESULTS
pigment analyses revealed different profiles of carotenoid and chlorophyll modification in 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> mutants. flavedo from 39b <dig> fruits showed an overall delay in carotenoid accumulation and chlorophyll degradation, while the flavedo of 39e <dig> was devoid of the apocarotenoid β-citraurin among other carotenoid alterations. a citrus microarray containing about  <dig>  cdna fragments was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed during colour change in the flavedo of 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> mutants respect to the parental variety. the results highlighted  <dig> and  <dig> genes that were respectively up- and down-regulated in both mutants. ccgcc <dig> gene, coding for a gcc type transcriptional factor, was found to be down-regulated. ccgcc <dig> expression was strongly induced at the onset of colour change in the flavedo of parental clementine fruit. moreover, treatment of fruits with gibberellins, a retardant of external ripening, delayed both colour break and ccgcc <dig> overexpression.


CONCLUSIONS
in this work, the citrus fruit ripening mutants 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> have been characterized at the phenotypic, biochemical and transcriptomic level. a defective synthesis of the apocarotenoid β-citraurin has been proposed to cause the yellowish colour of fully ripe 39e <dig> flavedo. the analyses of the mutant transcriptomes revealed that colour change during peel ripening was strongly associated with a major mobilization of mineral elements and with other previously known metabolic and photosynthetic changes. the expression of ccgcc <dig> was associated with peel ripening since ccgcc <dig> down-regulation correlated with a delay in colour break induced by genetic, developmental and hormonal causes.
