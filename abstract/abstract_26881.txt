BACKGROUND
ciguatoxins  are polyether marine neurotoxins and potent activators of voltage-gated sodium channels. this toxin is carried by multiple reef-fish species and human consumption of ciguatoxins can result in an explosive gastrointestinal/neurologic illness. this study characterizes the global transcriptional response in mouse brain to a symptomatic dose of the highly toxic pacific ciguatoxin p-ctx- <dig> and additionally compares this data to transcriptional profiles from liver and whole blood examined previously. adult male c57/bl <dig> mice were injected with  <dig>  ng/g p-ctx- <dig> while controls received only vehicle. animals were sacrificed at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hrs and transcriptional profiling was performed on brain rna with agilent whole genome microarrays. rt-pcr was used to independently validate gene expression and the web tool david was used to analyze gene ontology  and molecular pathway enrichment of the gene expression data.


RESULTS
a pronounced 4Â°c hypothermic response was recorded in these mice, reaching a minimum at  <dig> hr and lasting for  <dig> hrs post toxin exposure. ratio expression data were filtered by intensity, fold change and p-value, with the resulting data used for time course analysis, k-means clustering, ontology classification and kegg pathway enrichment. top go hits for this gene set included acute phase response and mono-oxygenase activity. molecular pathway analysis showed enrichment for complement/coagulation cascades and metabolism of xenobiotics. many immediate early genes such as fos, jun and early growth response isoforms were down-regulated although others associated with stress such as glucocorticoid responsive genes were up-regulated. real time pcr confirmation was performed on  <dig> differentially expressed genes with a correlation of  <dig>   with microarray results.


CONCLUSIONS
many of the genes differentially expressed in this study, in parallel with the hypothermia, figure prominently in protection against neuroinflammation. pathologic activity of the complement/coagulation cascade has been shown in patients suffering from a chronic form of ciguatera poisoning and is of particular interest in this model. anti-inflammatory processes were at work not only in the brain but were also seen in whole blood and liver of these animals, creating a systemic anti-inflammatory environment to protect against the initial cellular damage caused by the toxin.
