BACKGROUND
oncolytic adenoviruses are promising agents for the multimodal treatment of cancer. however, tumor-selectivity is crucial for their applicability in patients. recent studies by several groups demonstrated that oncolytic adenoviruses with tumor-/tissue-specific expression of the e <dig> and e <dig> genes, which are pivotal for adenoviral replication, have a specificity profile that is superior to viruses that solely target the expression of e <dig> or e <dig> genes. presently the e <dig> and e <dig> regions are modified in a time consuming sequential fashion.


RESULTS
based on the widely used adenoviral cloning system adeasy we generated a novel transfer vector that allows efficient and rapid generation of conditionally replication-competent adenovirus type  <dig> based vectors with the viral e <dig> and e <dig> genes under the transcriptional control of heterologous promoters. for insertion of the promoters of interest our transfer vector has two unique multiple cloning sites. additionally, our shuttle plasmid allows encoding of a transgene within the e1a transcription unit. the modifications, including e <dig> mutations, are introduced into the adenoviral genome by a single homologous recombination step in escherichia coli. subsequently infectious viruses are rescued from plasmids. as a proof-of-concept we generated two conditionally replication-competent adenoviruses ad.ki•cox and ad.cox•ki with the promoters of the ki- <dig> protein and the cyclooxygenase- <dig>  driving e <dig> and e <dig> and vice versa.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated with our cloning system efficient generation of double heterologous promoter controlled oncolytic adenoviral vectors by a single homologous recombination step in bacteria. the generated viruses showed preferential replication in tumor cells and in a subcutaneous ht- <dig> colon cancer xenograft model the viruses demonstrated significant oncolytic activity comparable with dl <dig>
