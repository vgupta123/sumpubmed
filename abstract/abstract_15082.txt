BACKGROUND
although carbohydrates are the third major class of biological macromolecules, after proteins and dna, there is neither a comprehensive database for carbohydrate structures nor an established universal structure encoding scheme for computational purposes. funding for further development of the complex carbohydrate structure database  ceased in  <dig>  and since then several initiatives have developed independent databases with partially overlapping foci. for each database, different encoding schemes for residues and sequence topology were designed. therefore, it is virtually impossible to obtain an overview of all deposited structures or to compare the contents of the various databases.


RESULTS
we have implemented procedures which download the structures contained in the seven major databases, e.g. glycosciences.de, the consortium for functional glycomics , the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  and the bacterial carbohydrate structure database . we have created a new database called glycomedb, containing all structures, their taxonomic annotations and references  for the original databases. more than  <dig> datasets were imported, resulting in more than  <dig> unique sequences now encoded in glycomedb using the universal format glycoct. inconsistencies were found in all public databases, which were discussed and corrected in multiple feedback rounds with the responsible curators.


CONCLUSIONS
glycomedb is a new, publicly available database for carbohydrate sequences with a unified, all-encompassing structure encoding format and ncbi taxonomic referencing. the database is updated weekly and can be downloaded free of charge. the java application glycoupdatedb is also available for establishing and updating a local installation of glycomedb. with the advent of glycomedb, the distributed islands of knowledge in glycomics are now bridged to form a single resource.
