BACKGROUND
the small gtpase rab1a and its isoform rab1b are essential regulating components in the vesicle transport between the er and the golgi apparatus. rab <dig> is thought to act as a molecular switch and can change between an active gtp-bound and an inactive gdp-bound conformation. to elucidate the function of rab <dig>  several approaches have been established to isolate effector proteins, which interact with the activated conformation of rab <dig>  to date p <dig>  gm <dig>  golgin- <dig> and mical have been identified as direct interacting partners. together with rab <dig>  these molecules are components of a protein complex, which mediates and regulates intracellular vesicle transport.


RESULTS
here, we report the characterization of iporin, which is similar to kiaa <dig> as a novel rab1-interacting protein. it was initially identified by yeast two-hybrid screening experiments with the active mutant of rab1b  as bait. iporin contains a sh <dig> domain and two polyproline stretches, which are known to play a role in protein/protein interactions. in addition, iporin encloses a run domain, which seems to be a major part of the rab1binding domain . iporin is ubiquitously expressed and immunofluorescence staining displays a cytosolic punctual distribution. interestingly, we also show that iporin interacts with another rab <dig> interacting partner, the gm <dig> protein.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that iporin is a potential new interacting partner of rab <dig>  iporin is different from already identified rab <dig> interacting proteins concerning protein structure and cellular localization. we conclude that iporin might function as a link between the targeting of er derived vesicles, triggered by the rab <dig> gtpase and a signaling pathway regulated by molecules containing sh <dig> and/or poly-proline regions. the characterization of this novel intermolecular relation could help to elucidate how vesicles find their way from er to the golgi apparatus.
