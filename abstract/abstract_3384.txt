BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile is an important enteropathogen affecting humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. the objectives of this study were to 1) compare the prevalence and characteristics of c. difficile isolated from the feces of raccoons trapped on swine farms and conservation sites, and 2) investigate the role of raccoons as potential reservoirs for host-adapted strains of c. difficile using a longitudinal study. fecal swabs were collected from raccoons at  <dig> conservation sites and  <dig> swine farms, once every five weeks, from may to november,  <dig> 


RESULTS
clostridium difficile was isolated from 9 %  of samples, from 12 %  of raccoons, from all  <dig> sites. a total of  <dig> different ribotypes were identified, including  <dig> ribotypes that matched recognized international designations and which are also found in humans . location type  was not associated with c. difficile status  but only  <dig> ribotypes  were found in both location types. the prevalence of ribotype  <dig> was significantly higher on farms  compared to conservation sites  . only one of  <dig> raccoons caught in multiple sessions was positive on more than one occasion.


CONCLUSIONS
we found no evidence to support the hypothesis that raccoons harbour host-adapted strains of c. difficile; rather, it appears that raccoons transiently acquire c. difficile from the environment. raccoons are unlikely to be maintaining c. difficile, but because we detected c. difficile strains that have the potential to cause illness in humans and livestock, and because raccoons can move relatively large distances, they may play a role in the dissemination of pathogenic ribotypes of c. difficile throughout the environment.
