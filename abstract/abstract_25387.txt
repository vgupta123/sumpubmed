BACKGROUND
acinetobacter baumannii is an emerging nosocomial pathogen worldwide with increasing prevalence of multi-drug and pan-drug resistance. a. baumannii exists widely in natural environment, especially in health care settings, and has been shown difficult to be eradicated. bacteriophages are often considered alternative agent for controlling bacterial infection and contamination. in this study, we described the isolation and characterization of one virulent bacteriophage ab <dig> capable of specifically infecting a. baumannii.


RESULTS
a virulent bacteriophage ab <dig>  specific for infecting a clinical strain a. baumannii kd <dig>  was first isolated from marine sediment sample. restriction analysis indicated that phage ab <dig> was a dsdna virus with an approximate genome size of  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb. transmission electron microscopy showed that phage ab <dig> had an icosahedral head with a non-contractile tail and collar or whisker structures, and might be tentatively classified as a member of the siphoviridae family. proteomic pattern of phage ab <dig>  generated by sds-page using purified phage particles, revealed five major bands and six minor bands with molecular weight ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kilo-dalton. also determined was the adsorption rate of phage ab <dig> to the host bacterium, which was significantly enhanced by addition of  <dig> mm cacl <dig>  in a single step growth test, phage ab <dig> was shown having a latent period of  <dig> minutes and a burst size of  <dig>  moreover, ph and thermal stability of phage ab <dig> were also investigated. at the optimal ph  <dig> ,  <dig> % of phages survived after  <dig> min incubation at 50Â°c. when phage ab <dig> was used to infect four additional clinical isolates of a. baumannii, one clinical isolate of stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and pseudomonas aeruginosa lab strains pak and pao <dig>  none of the tested strains was found susceptible, indicating a relatively narrow host range for phage ab <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
phage ab <dig> was capable of eliciting efficient lysis of a. baumannii, revealing its potential as a non-toxic sanitizer for controlling a. baumannii infection and contamination in both hospital and other public environments.
