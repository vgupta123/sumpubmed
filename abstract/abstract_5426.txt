BACKGROUND
rates of resistance to macrolide antibiotics in streptococcus pneumoniae are rising around the world due to the spread of mobile genetic elements harboring mef and erm genes and post-vaccine clonal expansion of strains that carry them.


RESULTS
characterization of  <dig> clinical isolates collected in arizona over a  <dig> year period shows  <dig> % are macrolide resistant. the largest portion of the macrolide-resistant population, 52%, is dual mef/erm-positive. all dual-positive isolates are multidrug-resistant clonal lineages of taiwan19f- <dig>  mostly multilocus sequence type  <dig>  carrying the recently described transposon tn <dig>  the remainder of the macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae collection includes 31% mef-positive, and 9% erm-positive strains.


CONCLUSIONS
the dual-positive, multidrug-resistant s. pneumoniae clones have likely expanded by switching to non-vaccine serotypes after the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine release, and their success limits therapy options. this upsurge could have a considerable clinical impact in arizona.
