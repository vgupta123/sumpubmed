BACKGROUND
salinivibrios are moderately halophilic bacteria found in salted meats, brines and hypersaline environments. we obtained three novel conspecific salinivibrio strains closely related to s. costicola, from socompa lake, a high altitude hypersaline andean lake .


RESULTS
the three novel salinivibrio spp. were extremely resistant to arsenic , nacl , and uv-b radiation  by means of phenotypic tests. our subsequent draft genome ionsequencing and rast-based genome annotation revealed the presence of genes related to arsenic, nacl, and uv radiation resistance. the three novel salinivibrio genomes also had the xanthorhodopsin gene cluster phylogenetically related to marinobacter and spiribacter. the genomic taxonomy analysis, including multilocus sequence analysis, average amino acid identity, and genome-to-genome distance revealed that the three novel strains belong to a new salinivibrio species.


CONCLUSIONS
arsenic resistance genes, genes involved in dna repair, resistance to extreme environmental conditions and the possible light-based energy production, may represent important attributes of the novel salinivibrios, allowing these microbes to thrive in the socompa lake.
