BACKGROUND
olig <dig> and olig <dig>  encoding closely related basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, were originally identified in screens for glial-specific genes. olig <dig> and olig <dig> are both expressed in restricted parts of the neuroepithelium of the embryonic spinal cord and telencephalon and subsequently in oligodendrocyte lineage cells throughout life. in the spinal cord, olig <dig> plays a crucial role in the development of oligodendrocytes and motor neurons, and both cell types are lost from olig <dig> null mutant mice. the role of olig <dig> has been more cryptic. it was initially reported that olig <dig> null mice  have a mild developmental phenotype characterized by a slight delay in oligodendrocyte differentiation. however, a subsequent study of the same line following removal of pgk-neo  found severe disruption of oligodendrocyte production, myelination failure and early postnatal lethality. a plausible explanation was proposed, that the highly expressed pgk-neo cassette in the original line might have up-regulated the neighbouring olig <dig> gene, compensating for loss of olig <dig>  however, this was not tested, so the importance of olig <dig> for oligodendrocyte development has remained unclear.


RESULTS
we generated two independent lines of olig <dig> null mice. both lines had a mild phenotype featuring slightly delayed oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation but no long-term effect. in addition, we found that olig <dig> transcripts were not up-regulated in our olig <dig> null mice.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings support the original conclusion that olig <dig> plays a minor and non-essential role in oligodendrocyte development and have implications for the interpretation of studies based on olig <dig> deficient mice  from different sources.
