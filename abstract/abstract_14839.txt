BACKGROUND
the expression of gene batteries, genomic units of functionally linked genes which are activated by similar sets of cis- and trans-acting regulators, has been proposed as a major determinant of cell specialization in metazoans. we developed a predictive procedure to screen the mouse and human genomes and transcriptomes for cases of gene-battery-like regulation.


RESULTS
in a screen that covered ~ <dig> per cent of all annotated protein-coding genes, we identified  <dig> co-expressed gene clusters with statistically supported sharing of cis-regulatory sequence elements.  <dig> predicted cases of over-represented transcription factor binding motifs were validated against the literature and fell into three categories:  previously described cases of gene battery-like regulation,  previously unreported cases of gene battery-like regulation with some support in a limited number of genes, and  predicted cases that currently lack experimental support. the novel predictions include for example sox  <dig> and rfx transcription factor binding sites that were detected in ~10% of all testis specific genes, and hnf- <dig> and  <dig> binding sites that were detected in ~30% of all kidney specific genes respectively. the results are publicly available at .


CONCLUSIONS
 <dig> co-expressed gene clusters were enriched for a total of  <dig> shared cis-regulatory sequence elements. a majority of these predictions represent novel cases of potential co-regulation of functionally coupled proteins. critical technical parameters were evaluated, and the results and the methods provide a valuable resource for future experimental design.
