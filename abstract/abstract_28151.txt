BACKGROUND

fusarium verticillioides is a common maize pathogen causing ear rot  and contamination of the grains with the fumonisin b <dig>  mycotoxin. resistance to fer and fb <dig> contamination are quantitative traits, affected by environmental conditions, and completely resistant maize genotypes to the pathogen are so far unknown. in order to uncover genomic regions associated to reduced fer and fb <dig> contamination and identify molecular markers for assisted selection, an f2: <dig> population of  <dig> progenies was developed crossing co <dig>  and co <dig>  genotypes. fer severity and fb <dig> contamination content were evaluated over 2 years and sowing dates  in ears artificially inoculated with f. verticillioides by the use of either side-needle or toothpick inoculation techniques.


RESULTS
weather conditions significantly changed in the two phenotyping seasons and fer and fb <dig> content distribution significantly differed in the f <dig> progenies according to the year and the sowing time. significant positive correlations  were detected between fer and fb <dig> contamination, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . a low positive correlation was determined between fb <dig> contamination and silking time . a genetic map was generated for the cross, based on  <dig> microsatellite markers and  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  derived from genotyping-by-sequencing . qtl analyses revealed  <dig> qtls for fer,  <dig> qtls for fb <dig> contamination and nine qtls for dts. eight qtls located on linkage group   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were in common between fer and fb <dig>  making possible the selection of genotypes with both low disease severity and low fumonisin contamination. moreover, five qtls on lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> located close to previously reported qtls for resistance to other mycotoxigenic fungi. finally,  <dig> candidate genes for resistance to f. verticillioides are proposed combining previous transcriptomic data with qtl mapping.


CONCLUSIONS
this study identified a set of qtls and candidate genes that could accelerate breeding for resistance of maize lines showing reduced disease severity and low mycotoxin contamination determined by f. verticillioides.
