BACKGROUND
rotavirus , is a member of the reoviridae family and an important etiological agent of acute viral gastroenteritis in the young. rotaviruses have a wide host range infecting a broad range of animal species, however little is known about rotavirus infection in exotic animals. in this paper we report the first characterisation of a rv strain from a giraffe calf.


RESULTS
this report describes the identification and detailed molecular characterisation of a rotavirus strain detected from a 14-day-old giraffe , presenting with acute diarrhea. the rv strain detected from the giraffe was characterized molecularly as g10p <cit> . detailed sequence analysis of vp <dig> and vp <dig> revealed significant identity at the amino acid sequence level to bovine rv .


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates the need for continuous surveillance of rv strains in various animal populations, which will facilitate the identification of rotavirus hosts not previously reported. furthermore, extending typical epidemiology studies to a broader host range will contribute to the timely identification of new emerging strain types.
