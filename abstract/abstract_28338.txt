BACKGROUND
neuromyelitis optica  is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system, which is characterized by autoantibodies directed against the water channel aquaporin- <dig> . as one of the main water regulators in the central nervous system, apq <dig> is supposed to be involved in the dynamics of brain edema. cerebral edema seriously affects clinical outcome after ischemic stroke; we therefore aimed to investigate whether nmo-antibodies may exert the same functional effects as an aqp4-inhibitor in-vivo in acute ischemic stroke.

methods
sixteen male wistar rats were randomized into two groups twice receiving either purified nmo-igg or immune globulin from healthy controls, 24 hours and 30 minutes before middle cerebral artery occlusion  was performed. t2-weighted mri was carried out 24 hours after mcao.


RESULTS
mri-examination showed a significant increase of infarct size in relation to the cerebral hemisphere volume with nmo-igg treated animals  when corrected for the space-occupying effect of vasogenic edema formation and similar results without edema correction . furthermore, t2-rt revealed a significant increase in cortical brain water content of the treatment group .


CONCLUSIONS
these results support the functional impact of nmo-antibodies and also offer an in-vivo-applicable animal model to investigate the properties of aqp <dig> in ischemic stroke.
