BACKGROUND
the 26s proteasome is the proteolytic machinery of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system responsible for most of the regulated intracellular protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. previously, we demonstrated meiotic cell cycle dependent phosphorylation of α <dig> subunit of the 26s proteasome. in this study, we analyzed the changes in the spotting pattern separated by 2-d gel electrophoresis of α subunits during xenopus oocyte maturation.


RESULTS
we identified cdna for three α-type subunits  of xenopus, then prepared antibodies specific for five subunits . with these antibodies and previously described monoclonal antibodies for subunits α <dig> and α <dig>  modifications to all α-type subunits of the 26s proteasome during xenopus meiotic maturation were examined by 2d-page. more than one spot for all subunits except α <dig> was identified. immunoblot analysis of 26s proteasomes purified from immature and mature oocytes showed a difference in the blots of α <dig> and α <dig>  with an additional spot detected in the 26s proteasome from immature oocytes .


CONCLUSIONS
six of α-type subunits of the xenopus 26s proteasome are modified in xenopus immature oocytes and two subunits  are modified meiotic cell cycle-dependently.
