BACKGROUND
micrornas, post-transcriptional repressors of gene expression, play a pivotal role in gene regulatory networks. they are involved in core cellular processes and their dysregulation is associated to a broad range of human diseases. this paper focus on a minimal microrna-mediated regulatory circuit, in which a protein-coding gene  is targeted by a microrna located inside one of its introns.


RESULTS
autoregulation via intronic micrornas is widespread in the human regulatory network, as confirmed by our bioinformatic analysis, and can perform several regulatory tasks despite its simple topology. our analysis, based on analytical calculations and simulations, indicates that this circuitry alters the dynamics of the host gene expression, can induce complex responses implementing adaptation and weberâ€™s law, and efficiently filters fluctuations propagating from the upstream network to the host gene. a fine-tuning of the circuit parameters can optimize each of these functions. interestingly, they are all related to gene expression homeostasis, in agreement with the increasing evidence suggesting a role of microrna regulation in conferring robustness to biological processes. in addition to model analysis, we present a list of bioinformatically predicted candidate circuits in human for future experimental tests.


CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here suggest a potentially relevant functional role for negative self-regulation via intronic micrornas, in particular as a homeostatic control mechanism of gene expression. moreover, the map of circuit functions in terms of experimentally measurable parameters, resulting from our analysis, can be a useful guideline for possible applications in synthetic biology.
