BACKGROUND
febrile respiratory illness  has a high impact on public health and global economics and poses a difficult challenge for differential diagnosis. a particular issue is the detection of genetically diverse pathogens, i.e. human rhinoviruses  and enteroviruses  which are frequent causes of fri. resequencing pathogen microarray technology has demonstrated potential for differential diagnosis of several respiratory pathogens simultaneously, but a high confidence design method to select probes for genetically diverse viruses is lacking.


RESULTS
using hrv and hev as test cases, we assess a general design strategy for detecting and serotyping genetically diverse viruses. a minimal number of probe sequences , which were potentially capable of detecting all serotypes of hrv and hev, were determined and implemented on the resequencing pathogen microarray rpm-flu v.30/ <dig> . the specificities of designed probes were validated using  <dig> hrv and  <dig> hev strains. all strains were successfully detected and identified at least to species level.  <dig> hrv strains and  <dig> hev strains could be further differentiated to serotype level.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a fundamental evaluation of simultaneous detection and differential identification of genetically diverse rna viruses with a minimal number of prototype sequences. the results demonstrated that the newly designed rpm-flu v.30/ <dig> can provide comprehensive and specific analysis of hrv and hev samples which implicates that this design strategy will be applicable for other genetically diverse viruses.
