BACKGROUND
the goat  represents one of the most important farm animal species. it is reared in all continents with an estimated world population of about  <dig> million of animals. despite its importance, studies on the goat genome are still in their infancy compared to those in other farm animal species. comparative mapping between cattle and goat showed only a few rearrangements in agreement with the similarity of chromosome banding. we carried out a cross species cattle-goat array comparative genome hybridization  experiment in order to identify copy number variations  in the goat genome analysing animals of different breeds  using a tiling oligonucleotide array with ~ <dig>  probes designed on the bovine genome.


RESULTS
we identified a total of  <dig> cnvs , with the largest number in the saanen breed and the lowest in the camosciata delle alpi goat. by aggregating overlapping cnvs identified in different animals we determined cnv regions : on the whole, we identified  <dig> cnvrs covering about  <dig>  mb of the virtual goat genome referred to the bovine genome . these  <dig> cnvrs included  <dig> loss and  <dig> gain and ranged from about  <dig> kb to about  <dig>  mb with a mean and median equal to  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. to evaluate whether the identified goat cnvrs overlap with those reported in the cattle genome, we compared our results with those obtained in four independent cattle experiments. overlapping between goat and cattle cnvrs was highly significant  suggesting that several chromosome regions might contain recurrent interspecies cnvrs. genes with environmental functions were over-represented in goat cnvrs as reported in other mammals.


CONCLUSIONS
we describe a first map of goat cnvrs. this provides information on a comparative basis with the cattle genome by identifying putative recurrent interspecies cnvs between these two ruminant species. several goat cnvs affect genes with important biological functions. further studies are needed to evaluate the functional relevance of these cnvs and their effects on behavior, production, and disease resistance traits in goats.
