BACKGROUND
a number of software packages are available to generate dna multiple sequence alignments  evolved under continuous-time markov processes on phylogenetic trees. on the other hand, methods of simulating the dna msa directly from the transition matrices do not exist. moreover, existing software restricts to the time-reversible models and it is not optimized to generate nonhomogeneous data .


RESULTS
we present the first package designed to generate msas evolving under discrete-time markov processes on phylogenetic trees, directly from probability substitution matrices. based on the input model and a phylogenetic tree in the newick format , the algorithm produces dna alignments of desired length. gennon-h is publicly available for download.


CONCLUSIONS
the software presented here is an efficient tool to generate dna msas on a given phylogenetic tree. gennon-h provides the user with the nonstationary or nonhomogeneous phylogenetic data that is well suited for testing complex biological hypotheses, exploring the limits of the reconstruction algorithms and their robustness to such models.
