BACKGROUND
extraintestinal pathogenic escherichia coli are important pathogens of human and animal hosts. some human and avian extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli are indistinguishable on the basis of diseases caused, multilocus sequence and phylogenetic typing, carriage of large virulence plasmids and traits known to be associated with extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli virulence.


RESULTS
the gene tkt <dig> identified by a previous signature-tagged transposon mutagenesis study, was found on a 16-kb genomic island of avian pathogenic escherichia coli  o <dig>  the first pathogenic escherichia coli strain whose genome has been completely sequenced. tkt <dig> was present in  <dig> %  of pathogenic escherichia coli strains, while only  <dig> %  of e. coli from the feces of apparently healthy chickens was positive. further, tkt <dig> was predominantly present in extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli belonging to the b <dig> phylogenetic group, as compared to extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli of other phylogenetic groups. the tkt1-containing genomic island is inserted between the mete and ysga genes of the e. coli k <dig> genome. among different extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli of the b <dig> phylogenetic group,  <dig> % of pathogenic escherichia coli,  <dig> % of human uropathogenic e.coli and  <dig> % of human neonatal meningitis-causing e. coli, respectively, harbor a complete copy of this island; whereas, only a few avian fecal e. coli strains contained the complete island. functional analysis showed that tkt <dig> confers very little transketolase activity but is involved in peptide nitrogen metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest tkt <dig> and its corresponding genomic island are frequently associated with avian and human expec and are involved in bipeptide metabolism.
