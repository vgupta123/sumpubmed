BACKGROUND
coxiella burnetii, the bacterium causing q fever, is an obligate intracellular biosafety level  <dig> agent. detection and quantification of these bacteria with conventional methods is time consuming and dangerous. during the last years, several pcr based diagnostic assays were developed to detect c. burnetii dna in cell cultures and clinical samples. we developed and evaluated taqman-based real-time pcr assays that targeted the singular icd  gene and the transposase of the is1111a element present in multiple copies in the c. burnetii genome.


RESULTS
to evaluate the precision of the icd and is <dig> real-time pcr assays, we performed different pcr runs with independent dna dilutions of the c. burnetii nine mile rsa <dig> strain. the results showed very low variability, indicating efficient reproducibility of both assays. using probit analysis, we determined that the minimal number of genome equivalents per reaction that could be detected with a 95% probability was  <dig> for the icd marker and  <dig>  for the is marker. plasmid standards with cloned icd and is <dig> fragments were used to establish standard curves which were linear over a range from  <dig> to  <dig> starting plasmid copy numbers. we were able to quantify cell numbers of a diluted, heat-inactivated coxiella isolate with a detection limit of  <dig> c. burnetii particles per reaction. real-time pcr targeting both markers was performed with dna of  <dig> different c. burnetii isolates originating from all over the world. using this approach, the number of is <dig> elements in the genome of the nine mile strain was determined to be  <dig>  close to  <dig>  the number revealed by genome sequencing. in other isolates, the number of is <dig> elements varied widely  and seemed to be very high in some isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
we validated taqman-based real-time pcr assays targeting the icd and is <dig> markers of c. burnetii. the assays were shown to be specific, highly sensitive and efficiently reproducible. cell numbers in dilutions of a c. burnetii isolate were reliably quantified. pcr quantification suggested a high variability of the number of is <dig> elements in different c. burnetii isolates, which may be useful for further phylogenetic studies.
