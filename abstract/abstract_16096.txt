BACKGROUND
coat colours in canines have many natural phenotypic variants. some of the genes and alleles involved also cause genetic developmental defects, which are also observed in humans and mice. we studied the genetic bases of the merle phenotype in dogs to shed light on the pigmentation mechanisms and to identify genes involved in these complex pathways. the merle phenotype includes a lack of eumelanic pigmentation and developmental defects, hearing impairments and microphthalmia. it is similar to that observed in microphthalmia mouse mutants.


RESULTS
taking advantage of the dog as a powerful genetic model and using recently available genomic resources, we investigated the segregation of the merle phenotype in a five-generation pedigree, comprising  <dig> sampled australian shepherd dogs. genetic linkage analysis allowed us to identify a locus for the merle phenotype, spanning  <dig>  megabases, at the centromeric tip of canine chromosome  <dig> . this locus was supported by a lod score of  <dig>  at a recombination fraction Î¸ =  <dig>  linkage analysis in three other breeds revealed that the same region is linked to the merle phenotype. this region, which is orthologous to human chromosome  <dig> , belongs to a conserved ordered segment in the human and mouse genome and comprises several genes potentially involved in pigmentation and development.


CONCLUSIONS
this study has identified the locus for the merle coat colour in dogs to be at the centromeric end of cfa <dig>  genetic studies on other breeds segregating the merle phenotype should allow the locus to be defined more accurately with the aim of identifying the gene. this work shows the power of the canine system to search for the genetic bases of mammalian pigmentation and developmental pathways.
