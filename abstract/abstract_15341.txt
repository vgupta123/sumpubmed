BACKGROUND
wheat  is one of the most important cereal crops, providing food for humans and feed for other animals. however, its productivity is challenged by various biotic and abiotic stresses such as fungal diseases, insects, drought, salinity, and cold. transcription factors  regulate gene expression in different tissues and at various developmental stages in plants and animals, and they can be identified and classified into families according to their structural and specialized dna-binding domains . transcription factors are important regulatory components of the genome, and are the main targets for engineering stress tolerance.


RESULTS
in total,  <dig> putative tfs were identified from wheat expressed sequence tags, and then classified into  <dig> families by using hmm searches against hidden markov model  profiles. in this study,  <dig> tfs represented approximately  <dig> % of all genes in the wheat genome, a smaller proportion than those reported for other cereals in planttfdb v <dig>   and plntfdb . we assembled information from the various databases for individual tfs, including annotations and details of their developmental stage- and tissue-specific expression patterns. based on this information, we identified  <dig> developmental stage-specific tfs and  <dig> tissue-specific tfs, accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the  <dig> wheat tfs, respectively. we identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> tissue-specific tfs in the flower, seed, root, leaf, stem, and crown, respectively. there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> tfs specifically expressed at the dormant seed, germinating seed, reproductive, ripening, seedling, and vegetative stages, respectively. we constructed a comprehensive database of wheat tfs, designated as wheattfdb .


CONCLUSIONS
approximately  <dig> %  of all genes in the wheat genome were identified as tfs, and were clustered into  <dig> tf families. we identified  <dig> developmental stage-specific tfs and  <dig> tissue-specific tfs, based on information about their developmental- and tissue-specific expression patterns obtained from publicly available gene expression databases. the  <dig> wheat tfs and their annotations are summarized in our database, wheattfdb. these data will be useful identifying target tfs involved in the stress response at a particular stage of development.
