BACKGROUND
nf-κb binds to the κb motif to regulate transcription of genes involved in growth, immunity and inflammation, and plays a pivotal role in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines after nerve injuries. the zinc finger protein zas <dig> also binds to the κb or similar motif. in addition to competition for common dna sites, in vitro experiments have shown that zas <dig> can inhibit nf-κb via the association with traf <dig> to inhibit the nuclear translocation of nf-κb. however, the physiological significance of the zas3-mediated inhibition of nf-κb has not been demonstrated. the purpose of this study is to characterize zas <dig> proteins in nervous tissues and to use spinal nerve ligation, a neuropathic pain model, to demonstrate a functional relationship between zas <dig> and nf-κb.


RESULTS
immunohistochemical experiments show that zas <dig> is expressed in specific regions of the central and peripheral nervous system. abundant zas <dig> expression is found in the trigeminal ganglion, hippocampal formation, dorsal root ganglia, and motoneurons. low levels of zas <dig> expressions are also found in the cerebral cortex and in the grey matter of the spinal cord. in those nervous tissues, zas <dig> is expressed mainly in the cell bodies of neurons and astrocytes. together with results of western blot analyses, the data suggest that zas <dig> protein isoforms with differential cellular distribution are produced in a cell-specific manner. further, neuropathic pain confirmed by persistent mechanical allodynia was manifested in rats seven days after l <dig> and l <dig> lumbar spinal nerve ligation. changes in gene expression, including a decrease in zas <dig> and an increase in the p <dig> subunit of nf-κb were observed in dorsal root ganglion ipsilateral to the ligation when compared to the contralateral side.


CONCLUSIONS
zas <dig> is expressed in nervous tissues involved in cognitive function and pain modulation. the down-regulation of zas <dig> after peripheral nerve injury may lead to activation of nf-κb, allowing wallerian regeneration and induction of nf-κb-dependent gene expression, including pro-inflammatory cytokines. we propose that reciprocal changes in the expression of zas <dig> and nf-κb might generate neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve injury.
