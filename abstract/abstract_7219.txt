BACKGROUND
serial analysis of gene expression  is a functional genomic technique that quantitatively analyzes the cellular transcriptome. the analysis of sage libraries relies on the identification of ditags from sequencing files; however, the software used to examine sage libraries cannot distinguish between authentic versus false ditags .


RESULTS
we provide examples of quasi-ditags that originate from cloning and sequencing artifacts  that are included in sage libraries. we have employed a mathematical model to predict the frequency of quasi-ditags in random nucleotide sequences, and our data show that clones containing less than or equal to  <dig> ditags  should be excluded from the analysis of sage catalogs.


CONCLUSIONS
cloning and sequencing artifacts contaminating sage libraries could be eliminated using simple pre-screening procedure to increase the reliability of the data.
