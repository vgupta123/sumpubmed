BACKGROUND
biclustering has been utilized to find functionally important patterns in biological problem. here a bicluster is a submatrix that consists of a subset of rows and a subset of columns in a matrix, and contains homogeneous patterns. the problem of finding biclusters is still challengeable due to computational complex trying to capture patterns from two-dimensional features.


RESULTS
we propose a probabilistic coevolutionary biclustering algorithm  that can cluster the rows and columns in a matrix simultaneously by utilizing a dynamic adaptation of multiple species and adopting probabilistic learning. in biclustering problems, a coevolutionary search is suitable since it can optimize interdependent subcomponents formed of rows and columns. furthermore, acquiring statistical information on two populations using probabilistic learning can improve the ability of search towards the optimum value. we evaluated the performance of pcoba on synthetic dataset and yeast expression profiles. the results demonstrated that pcoba outperformed previous evolutionary computation methods as well as other biclustering methods.


CONCLUSIONS
our approach for searching particular biological patterns could be valuable for systematically understanding functional relationships between genes and other biological components at a genome-wide level.
