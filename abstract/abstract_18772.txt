BACKGROUND
diaphanous-related formins govern actin-based processes involved in many cellular functions, such as cell movement and invasion. possible connections to developmental processes and cellular changes associated with malignant phenotype make them interesting study targets. in spite of this, very little is known of the tissue distribution and cellular location of any mammalian formin. here we have carried out a comprehensive analysis of the formin family member formin -like  <dig>  in human tissues.


RESULTS
an fmnl <dig> antibody was raised and characterized. the affinity-purified fmnl <dig> antibody was validated by western blotting, northern blotting, a peptide competition assay and sirna experiments. bioinformatics-based mrna profiling indicated that fmnl <dig> is widely expressed in human tissues. the highest mrna levels were seen in central and peripheral nervous systems. immunohistochemical analysis of  <dig> different human tissues showed that fmnl <dig> is widely expressed, in agreement with the mrna profile. the widest expression was detected in the central nervous system, since both neurons and glial cells expressed fmnl <dig>  strong expression was also seen in many epithelia. however, the expression in different cell types was not ubiquitous. many mesenchymal cell types showed weak immunoreactivity and cells lacking expression were seen in many tissues. the subcellular location of fmnl <dig> was cytoplasmic, and in some tissues a strong perinuclear dot was detected. in cultured cells fmnl <dig> showed mostly a cytoplasmic localization with perinuclear accumulation consistent with the golgi apparatus. furthermore, fmnl <dig> co-localized with f-actin to the tips of cellular protrusions in wm <dig> human melanoma cells. this finding is in line with fmnl2's proposed function in the formation of actin filaments in cellular protrusions, during amoeboid cellular migration.


CONCLUSIONS
fmnl <dig> is expressed in multiple human tissues, not only in the central nervous system. the expression is especially strong in gastrointestinal and mammary epithelia, lymphatic tissues, placenta, and in the reproductive tract. in cultured melanoma cells, fmnl <dig> co-localizes with f-actin dots at the tips of cellular protrusions.
