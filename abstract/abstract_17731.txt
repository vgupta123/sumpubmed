BACKGROUND
micrornas  have been shown to play key roles in regulating gene expression at post-transcriptional level, but mirnas associated with natural deastringency of chinese pollination-constant nonastringent persimmon  have never been identified.


RESULTS
in this study, two small rna libraries established using ‘eshi no. 1’ persimmon  fruits collected at  <dig> and 20 weeks after flowering  were sequenced through solexa platform in order to identify mirnas involved in deastringency of persimmon. a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads were generated for the libraries at  <dig> and  <dig> waf, respectively. based on sequence similarity and hairpin structure prediction,  <dig> known mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified using persimmon transcriptome data. sixty one of the characterized mirnas exhibited pronounced difference in the expression levels between  <dig> and  <dig> waf,  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated. expression profiles of  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel mirnas were validated by stem loop qrt-pcr. a total of  <dig> target genes were predicted for the differentially expressed mirnas, including several genes that have been reported to be implicated in proanthocyanidins  accumulation. in addition, two transcription factors, a grf and a bhlh, were experimentally confirmed as the targets of dka-mir <dig> and dka-mir <dig>  respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the present data unraveled several important mirnas in persimmon. among them, mir395p-3p and mir858b may regulate bhlh and myb, respectively, which are influenced by spl under the control of mir156j-5p and in turn regulate the structural genes involved in pa biosynthesis. in addition, dka-mir396g and mir2911a may regulate their target genes associated with glucosylation and insolubilization of tannin precursors. all of these mirnas might play key roles in the regulation of astringency in persimmon fruits under normal development conditions.
