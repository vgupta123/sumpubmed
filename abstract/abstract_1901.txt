BACKGROUND
palmitic acid, the most common saturated free fatty acid, has been implicated in er  stress-mediated apoptosis. this lipoapotosis is dependent, in part, on the upregulation of the activating transcription factor- <dig> . to better understand the mechanisms by which palmitate upregulates the expression level of atf <dig>  we integrated literature information on palmitate-induced er stress signaling into a discrete dynamic model. the model provides an in silico framework that enables simulations and predictions. the model predictions were confirmed through further experiments in human hepatocellular carcinoma  cells and the results were used to update the model and our current understanding of the signaling induced by palmitate.


RESULTS
the three key things from the in silico simulation and experimental results are: 1) palmitate induces different signaling pathways , perk , pka -dependent protein kinase a) in a time dependent-manner, 2) both atf <dig> and creb <dig>  interact with the atf <dig> promoter to contribute to a prolonged accumulation of atf <dig>  and 3) creb <dig> is involved in er-stress induced apoptosis upon palmitate treatment, by regulating atf <dig> expression and possibly ca2+ dependent-cam  signaling pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
the in silico model helped to delineate the essential signaling pathways in palmitate-mediated apoptosis.
