BACKGROUND
an optimal seedling development of brassica napus plants leads to a higher yield stability even under suboptimal growing conditions and has therefore a high importance for plant breeders. the objectives of our study were to  examine the expression levels of candidate genes in seedling leaves of b. napus and correlate these with seedling development as well as  detect genome regions associated with gene expression levels and seedling development traits in b. napus by genome-wide association mapping.


RESULTS
the expression levels of the  <dig> candidate genes examined in the  <dig> b. napus inbreds showed an averaged standard deviation of  <dig>  across all inbreds and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the gene expression differences between the  <dig> b. napus inbreds were more than adequate for the correlation with phenotypic variation of seedling development. the average of the absolute value correlations of the correlation coefficients of  <dig>  were observed with a range from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the candidate genes ger <dig>  ailp <dig>  pect, and fbp were strongly correlated with the seedling development traits. in a genome-wide association study, we detected a total of  <dig> associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms  and the seedling development traits and  <dig> snp-gene associations for the candidate genes with a p-value <  <dig> . for the projected leaf area traits we identified five different association hot spots on the chromosomes a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
a total of  <dig> % of the adjacent snps on the a genome and  <dig> % of the adjacent snps on the c genome had a distance smaller than the average range of linkage disequilibrium. therefore, this genome-wide association study is expected to result on average in  <dig> % of the possible power. compared to previous studies in b. napus, the snp marker density of our study is expected to provide a higher power to detect snp-trait/-gene associations in the b. napus diversity set. the large number of associations detected for the examined  <dig> seedling development traits indicated that these are genetically complex inherited. the results of our analyses suggested that the studied genes ribulose  <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit  on the chromosomes a <dig> and c <dig> and fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase precursor  on the chromosomes a <dig> and c <dig> are cis-regulated.
