BACKGROUND
tardigrades represent an animal phylum with extraordinary resistance to environmental stress.


RESULTS
to gain insights into their stress-specific adaptation potential, major clusters of related and similar proteins are identified, as well as specific functional clusters delineated comparing all tardigrades and individual species  and functional elements in tardigrade mrnas are analysed. we find that  <dig> % of the total sequences clustered in  <dig> clusters of more than  <dig> proteins. among these are ten tardigrade specific as well as a number of stress-specific protein clusters. tardigrade-specific functional adaptations include strong protein, dna- and redox protection, maintenance and protein recycling. specific regulatory elements regulate tardigrade mrna stability such as lox p dice elements whereas  <dig> other rna elements of higher eukaryotes are not found. further features of tardigrade specific adaption are rapidly identified by sequence and/or pattern search on the web-tool tardigrade analyzer http://waterbear.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de. the work-bench offers nucleotide pattern analysis for promotor and regulatory element detection  as well as rapid cog search for function assignments including species-specific repositories of all analysed data.


CONCLUSIONS
different protein clusters and regulatory elements implicated in tardigrade stress adaptations are analysed including unpublished tardigrade sequences.
