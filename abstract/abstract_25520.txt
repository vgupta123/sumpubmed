BACKGROUND
gene discovery algorithms typically examine sequence data for low level patterns. a novel method to computationally discover higher order dna structures is presented, using a context sensitive grammar. the algorithm was applied to the discovery of gene cassettes associated with integrons. the discovery and annotation of antibiotic resistance genes in such cassettes is essential for effective monitoring of antibiotic resistance patterns and formulation of public health antibiotic prescription policies.


RESULTS
we discovered two new putative gene cassettes using the method, from  <dig> integron features and  <dig> genbank sequences. the system achieved Îº =  <dig>  annotation agreement with an expert gold standard of  <dig> sequences. in rediscovery experiments, we deleted  <dig>  cassette instances over  <dig> experiments and correctly relabelled  <dig> % , with no false positives.

error analysis demonstrated that for  <dig>  missed deletions, two adjacent deleted cassettes were labeled as a single cassette, increasing performance to  <dig> % .


CONCLUSIONS
using grammars we were able to represent heuristic background knowledge about large and complex structures in dna. importantly, we were also able to use the context embedded in the model to discover new putative antibiotic resistance gene cassettes. the method is complementary to existing automatic annotation systems which operate at the sequence level.
