BACKGROUND
borna disease virus is a neurotropic pathogen and infects the central nervous system. this virus infected a variety of animal species including cows. the most of cows infected with borna disease virus  <dig>  exhibit subclinical infection without any neurological symptoms throughout their lifetime. we previously reported on the low conception rates in-seropositive cows. interferon-τ  plays an important role in stable fertilization, and is produced from the fetal side following embryo growth at 15– <dig> days of pregnancy. ifn-τ induces the expression of interferon-stimulated gene   <dig> and mx <dig> in peripheral blood mononuclear cells . to understand the embryo growth and maternal reaction during early pregnancy in cows with bodv- <dig> infection, we aimed to assess the gene expression of isg <dig> and mx <dig> from pbmcs in bodv-1-seropositive cows.


RESULTS
none of the cows showed any clinical and neurological symptoms. among the cows that conceived, the expressions of the isg <dig> and mx <dig> genes were greater in the bodv-1-seropositive cows than in the bodv-1-seronegative cows; the difference was significant between the cows that conceived and those that did not .


CONCLUSIONS
the expression of isg <dig> and mx <dig> genes during early pregnancy significantly increased in the bodv-1-seropositive cows and may be important for the maintenance of stable pregnancy in bodv-1-infected cows. in contrast, the gene expression levels of isg <dig> and mx <dig> did not significantly increase during early pregnancy in bodv-1-seronegative cows. thus, bodv- <dig> infection may lead to instability in the maintenance of early pregnancy by interfering with inf-τ production.
