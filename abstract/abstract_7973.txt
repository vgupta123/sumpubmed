BACKGROUND

mycoplasma hominis is an opportunistic human pathogen, associated with clinically diverse disease. currently, there is no standardised method for typing m. hominis, which would aid in understanding pathogen epidemiology and transmission. due to availability and costs of whole genome sequencing and the challenges in obtaining adequate m. hominis dna, the use of whole genome sequence analysis to provide clinical guidance is unpractical for this bacterial species as well as other fastidious organisms.


RESULTS
this study identified pan-genome set of  <dig> genes found to be present in four published reference genomes. a subset of  <dig> genes was identified to be core genome for  <dig> isolates and  <dig> reference. leave-one-out analysis of the core genes highlighted set of  <dig> genes that are required to recapture the original phylogenetic relationships observed using whole genome snp analysis. three 7-locus mlst schemas with high diversity index  and low dn/ds ratios  were derived that could be used to confer good discrimination between strains and could be of practical use in future studies direct on clinical specimens.


CONCLUSIONS
the genes proposed in this study could be utilised to design a cost-effective and rapid pcr-based mlst assay that could be applied directly to clinical isolates, without prior isolation. this study includes additional genomic analysis revealing high levels of genetic heterogeneity among this species. this provides a novel and evidence based approach for the development of mlst schema that accurately represent genomic phylogeny for use in epidemiology and transmission studies.
