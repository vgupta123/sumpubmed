BACKGROUND
shigella bacteria cause dysentery, which remains a significant threat to public health. shigella flexneri is the most common species in both developing and developed countries. five shigella genomes have been sequenced, revealing dynamic and diverse features. to investigate the intra-species diversity of s. flexneri genomes further, we have sequenced the complete genome of s. flexneri 5b strain  <dig>  and compared it with s. flexneri 2a .


RESULTS
the sf <dig> chromosome is  <dig> -mb in size, a little smaller than that of sf <dig>  mainly because the former lacks the shi- <dig> pathogenicity island . compared with sf <dig>  there are  <dig> inversions and one translocation in sf <dig>  which are probably mediated by insertion sequences . there are clear differences in the known pais between these two genomes. the bacteriophage sfv segment remaining in shi-o of sf <dig> is clearly larger than the remnants of bacteriophage sfii in sf <dig>  shi- <dig> is absent from sf <dig> but a specific related protein is found next to the phev locus. shi- <dig> is involved in one intra-replichore inversion near the origin of replication, which may change the expression of iut/iuc genes. moreover, genes related to the glycine-betaine biosynthesis pathway are present only in sf <dig> among the known shigella genomes.


CONCLUSIONS
our data show that the two s. flexneri genomes are very similar, which suggests a high level of structural and functional conservation between the two serotypes. the differences reflect different selection pressures during evolution. the ancestor of s. flexneri probably acquired shi- <dig> and shi- <dig> before shi-o was integrated and the serotypes diverged. shi- <dig> was subsequently deleted from the s. flexneri 5b genome by recombination, but stabilized in the s. flexneri 2a genome. these events may have contributed to the differences in pathogenicity and epidemicity between the two serotypes of s. flexneri.
