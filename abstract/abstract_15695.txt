BACKGROUND
the amyloid precursor protein  is transported via the secretory pathway to the cell surface, where it may be cleaved within its ectodomain by α-secretase, or internalized within clathrin-coated vesicles. an alternative proteolytic pathway occurs within the endocytic compartment, where the sequential action of β- and γ-secretases generates the amyloid β protein . in this study, we investigated the effects of modulators of endocytosis on app processing.


RESULTS
human embryonic kidney cells were transfected with a dominant negative mutant of dynamin i, an important mediator of clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and app proteolysis was analyzed. overexpression of the mutant dynamin  resulted in increased shedding of the app ectodomain , accumulation of the c-terminal α-secretase product c <dig>  and a reduction in the release of aβ. levels of mature app on the cell surface were increased in cells expressing dyn i k44a, and internalization of surface-immunolabeled app, assessed by fluorescence microscopy, was inhibited. dynamin is a substrate for protein kinase c , and it was hypothesized that activators of pkc, which are known to stimulate α-secretase-mediated cleavage of app, might exert their effects by inhibiting dynamin-dependent endocytosis. however, the internalization of surface-biotinylated app was unaffected by treatment of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in the presence of the α-secretase inhibitor tapi- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the results indicate that app is internalized by a dynamin-dependent process, and suggest that alterations in the activity of proteins that mediate endocytosis might lead to significant changes in aβ production.
