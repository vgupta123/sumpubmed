BACKGROUND
studies have examined the function of pi 3-kinase in the early developmental processes that operate in oocytes or early embryos of various species. however, the roles of egg-associated pi 3-kinase and akt, especially in signal transduction at fertilization, are not well understood.


RESULTS
here we show that in xenopus eggs, a potent inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , ly <dig> inhibits sperm-induced activation of the tyrosine kinase src and a transient increase in the intracellular concentration of ca2+ at fertilization. ly <dig> also inhibits sperm-induced dephosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, breakdown of cyclin b <dig> and mos, and first embryonic cleavage, all of which are events of ca2+-dependent egg activation. in fertilized eggs, an 85-kda subunit of pi 3-kinase  undergoes a transient translocation to the low-density, detergent-insoluble membranes  where src tyrosine kinase signaling is operating. however, the tyrosine phosphorylation of p <dig> in fertilized eggs is not as evident as that in h2o2-activated eggs, arguing against the possibility that pi 3-kinase is activated by src phosphorylation. nevertheless, sperm-induced activation of pi 3-kinase has been demonstrated by the finding that akt, a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase, is phosphorylated at threonine- <dig>  the threonine-phosphorylated akt also localizes to the membrane microdomains of fertilized eggs. application of bp, an inhibitor of pten that dephosphorylates pip <dig>  the enzymatic product of pi 3-kinase, promotes parthenogenetic activation of xenopus eggs. in vitro kinase assays demonstrate that pip <dig> activates src in a dose-dependent manner.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that pi 3-kinase is involved in sperm-induced egg activation via production of pip <dig> that would act as a positive regulator of the src signaling pathway in xenopus fertilization.
