BACKGROUND
the maedi-visna  lentivirus causes two slowly progressive eventually fatal diseases of sheep, maedi, a progressive interstitial pneumonia, and visna, a progressive demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. other lentiviruses also cause fatal slow infections in their natural hosts, e.g. the hiv virus in humans. results of experimental vaccination against any lentivirus where vaccinees are challenged by natural routes, may therefore be of general interest. from 1991– <dig> experiments with formalin-inactivated whole maedi-visna virus vaccine were carried out in the department of microbiology at the university of iceland. western blot tests showed good immune response to all major proteins of the virus. when aluminium hydroxide was added to the vaccine all vaccinees developed neutralizing antibodies to the vaccine strain at titers 1/ <dig> – 1/ <dig>  after housing  <dig> twin pairs, one twin in each pair vaccinated, the other unvaccinated, with infected sheep for  <dig> years, all the unvaccinated twins became infected, but only  <dig> of their vaccinated siblings as confirmed by virus cultivation experiments on tissues from their lungs spleens lymph nodes and choroid plexuses.


RESULTS
one twin in each of  <dig> female twin pairs, born into a maedi-visna-infected sheep flock and kept under natural farming conditions in cyprus, was vaccinated at birth,  <dig> weeks and  <dig> months, with formalin-inactivated whole maedi-visna lentivirus vaccine adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide.  <dig> mothers of the twins were seronegative,  <dig> seroconverting and  <dig> had old infection. of  <dig> vaccinees born to seronegative mothers  <dig> were uninfected at  <dig> months, but only  <dig> of their unvaccinated siblings. of  <dig> unvaccinated twins born to seroconverting mothers,  <dig> caught infection during their first  <dig> weeks, but only  <dig> of their vaccinated siblings. vaccination had no effects on  <dig> vaccinees born to mothers with long-standing maedi-visna infections and broad andibody response at birth of their lambs.


CONCLUSIONS
compared with their unvaccinated siblings, natural infection was delayed in significant number of vaccinated twins born by seronegative and seroconverting mothers and vaccinated at birth,  <dig> weeks and  <dig> months with formalin inactivated whole mv vaccine adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide. maternal antibodies interfered with vaccination so early in life if the mother had old infection.
