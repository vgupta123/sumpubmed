BACKGROUND
the primates are among the most broadly studied mammalian orders, with the published literature containing extensive analyses of their behavior, physiology, genetics and ecology. the importance of this group in medical and biological research is well appreciated, and explains the numerous molecular phylogenies that have been proposed for most primate families and genera. composite estimates for the entire order have been infrequently attempted, with the last phylogenetic reconstruction spanning the full range of primate evolutionary relationships having been conducted over a decade ago.


RESULTS
to estimate the structure and tempo of primate evolutionary history, we employed bayesian phylogenetic methods to analyze data supermatrices comprising  <dig> mitochondrial genes  from  <dig> species across  <dig> genera and  <dig> nuclear genes  from  <dig> genera. many taxa were only partially represented, with an average of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mitochondrial genes per species and per genus, respectively, and  <dig>  nuclear genes per genus. our analyses of mitochondrial dna place tarsiiformes as the sister group of strepsirrhini. within haplorrhini, we find support for the primary divergence of pitheciidae in platyrrhini, and our results suggest a sister grouping of african and non-african colobines within colobinae and of cercopithecini and papionini within cercopthecinae. date estimates for nodes within each family and genus are presented, with estimates for key splits including: strepsirrhini-haplorrhini  <dig> million years ago , lemuriformes-lorisiformes  <dig> mya, platyrrhini-catarrhini  <dig> mya and cercopithecoidea-hominoidea  <dig> mya.


CONCLUSIONS
we present an up-to-date, comprehensive estimate of the structure and tempo of primate evolutionary history. although considerable gaps remain in our knowledge of the primate phylogeny, increased data sampling, particularly from nuclear loci, will be able to provide further resolution.
