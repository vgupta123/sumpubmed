BACKGROUND
analysis of protein-protein interactions  is a valuable approach for the characterization of huge networks of protein complexes or proteins of unknown function. co-immunoprecipitation  using affinity resins coupled to protein a/g is the most widely used method for ppi detection. however, this traditional large scale resin-based coip is too laborious and time consuming. to overcome this problem, we developed a miniaturized sandwich immunoassay platform  by combining antibody array technology and coip methods.


RESULTS
based on anti-flag antibody spotted aldehyde slides, msip enables simple, rapid and large scale detection of ppis by fluorescent labeling anti-myc antibody. by analyzing well-known interacting and non-interacting protein pairs, msip was demonstrated to be highly accurate and reproducible. compared to traditional resin-based coip, msip results in higher sensitivity and enhanced throughput, with the additional benefit of digital read-outs. in addition, msip was shown to be a highly useful validation platform to confirm ppi candidates that have been identified from yeast two hybrid systems.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, msip is proved to be a simple, cost-saving and highly efficient technique for the comprehensive study of ppis.
