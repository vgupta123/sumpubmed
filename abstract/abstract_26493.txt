BACKGROUND
publicly available expression compendia that measure both mrnas and srnas provide a promising resource to simultaneously infer the transcriptional and the posttranscriptional network. to maximally exploit the information contained in such compendia, we propose an analysis flow that combines publicly available expression compendia and sequence-based predictions to infer novel srna-target interactions and to reconstruct the relation between the srna and the transcriptional network.


RESULTS
we relied on module inference to construct modules of coexpressed genes . tfs and srnas were assigned to these modules using the state-of-the-art inference techniques lemone and context likelihood of relatedness . combining these expressions with sequence-based srna-target interactions allowed us to predict  <dig> novel srna-target interactions comprising  <dig> srnas. our results highlight the role of the posttranscriptional network in finetuning the transcriptional regulation, e.g. by intra-operonic regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
in this work we show how strategies that combine expression information with sequence-based predictions can help unveiling the intricate interaction between the transcriptional and the posttranscriptional network in prokaryotic model systems.
