BACKGROUND
the insulinoma associated protein tyrosine phosphatase  <dig>  is one of the immunodominant autoantigens involved in the autoimmune attack to the beta-cell in type  <dig> diabetes mellitus. in this work we have developed a complete and original process for the production and recovery of the properly folded intracellular domain of ia- <dig> fused to thioredoxin  in escherichia coli gi <dig> and gi <dig> strains. we have also carried out the biochemical and immunochemical characterization of trxia-2icand design variants of non-radiometric immunoassays for the efficient detection of ia- <dig> autoantibodies .


RESULTS
the main findings can be summarized in the following statements: i) trxia-2ic expression after 3 h of induction on gi <dig> strain yielded ≈ 10 mg of highly pure trxia-2ic/l of culture medium by a single step purification by affinity chromatography, ii) the molecular weight of trxia-2ic  could be estimated by sds-page, size exclusion chromatography and mass spectrometry, iii) trxia-2ic was properly identified by western blot and mass spectrometric analysis of proteolytic digestions , iv) excellent immunochemical behavior of properly folded full trxia-2ic was legitimized by inhibition or displacement of ia- <dig> binding from ia-2a present in argentinian type  <dig> diabetic patients, v) great stability over time was found under proper storage conditions and vi) low cost and environmentally harmless elisa methods for ia-2a assessment were developed, with colorimetric or chemiluminescent detection.


CONCLUSIONS

e. coli gi <dig> strain emerged as a handy source of recombinant ia-2ic, achieving high levels of expression as a thioredoxin fusion protein, adequately validated and applicable to the development of innovative and cost-effective immunoassays for ia-2a detection in most laboratories.
