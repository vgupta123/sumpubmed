BACKGROUND
the androgen receptor plays a critical role throughout the progression of prostate cancer and is an important drug target for this disease. while chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing  is becoming an essential tool for studying transcription and chromatin modification factors, it has rarely been employed in the context of drug discovery.


RESULTS
here we report changes in the genome-wide ar binding landscape due to dose-dependent inhibition by drug-like small molecules using chip-seq. integration of sequence analysis, transcriptome profiling, cell viability assays and xenograft tumor growth inhibition studies enabled us to establish a direct cistrome-activity relationship for two novel potent ar antagonists. by selectively occupying the strongest binding sites, ar signaling remains active even when androgen levels are low, as is characteristic of first-line androgen ablation therapy. coupled cistrome and transcriptome profiling upon small molecule antagonism led to the identification of a core set of ar direct effector genes that are most likely to mediate the activities of targeted agents: unbiased pathway mapping revealed that ar is a key modulator of steroid metabolism by forming a tightly controlled feedback loop with other nuclear receptor family members and this oncogenic effect can be relieved by antagonist treatment. furthermore, we found that ar also has an extensive role in negative gene regulation, with estrogen  receptor likely mediating its function as a transcriptional repressor.


CONCLUSIONS
our study provides a global and dynamic view of arâ€™s regulatory program upon antagonism, which may serve as a molecular basis for deciphering and developing ar therapeutics.
