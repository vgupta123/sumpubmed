BACKGROUND
zebrafish embryos are transcriptionally silent until activation of the zygotic
genome during the 10th cell cycle. onset of transcription is followed
by cellular and morphological changes involving cell speciation and gastrulation.
previous genome-wide surveys of transcriptional changes only assessed gene
expression levels; however, recent studies have shown the necessity to map
isoform-specific transcriptional changes. here, we perform isoform discovery and
quantification on transcriptome sequences from before and after zebrafish zygotic
genome activation .


RESULTS
we identify novel isoforms and isoform switches during zga for genes related to
cell adhesion, pluripotency and dna methylation. isoform switching events include
alternative splicing and changes in transcriptional start sites and in 3’
untranslated regions. new isoforms are identified even for well-characterized
genes such as pou5f <dig>  sall <dig> and dnmt <dig>  genes involved
in cell-cell interactions such as f11r and magi <dig> display isoform
switches with alterations of coding sequences. we also detect over 1000
transcripts that acquire a longer 3’ terminal exon when transcribed by the
zygote compared to their maternal transcript counterparts. chip-sequencing data
mapped onto skipped exon events reveal a correlation between histone h3k36
trimethylation peaks and skipped exons, suggesting epigenetic marks being part of
alternative splicing regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
the novel isoforms and isoform switches reported here include regulators of
transcriptional, cellular and morphological changes taking place around zga. our
data display an array of isoform-related functional changes and represent a
valuable resource complementary to existing early embryo transcriptomes.
