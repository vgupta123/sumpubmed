BACKGROUND
multiple myeloma  is an important human and canine cancer for which novel therapies remain necessary. vdc- <dig> , a novel double prodrug of the anti-proliferative nucleotide analog 9- guanine , possesses potent cytotoxic activity in vitro in human lymphoblasts and leukemia cell lines and in vivo in spontaneous canine lymphoma. given the similarity in lineage between lymphoma and mm, we hypothesized that vdc- <dig> would be active against mm.


RESULTS
we evaluated the in vitro antiproliferative effects of vdc- <dig> against  <dig> human mm cell lines, and we performed a phase-ii clinical trial in  <dig> dogs with spontaneous mm. each dog was treated with a maximum of  <dig> doses of vdc- <dig> monotherapy over 10–15 weeks. dose-dependent antiproliferative activity was observed in all evaluated cell lines. major antitumor responses  were observed in  <dig> of  <dig> evaluable dogs for a median of  <dig> days, including a durable stringent complete response  in a dog with melphalan-refractory disease.  <dig> dogs were euthanized due to presumed pulmonary fibrosis; there were no other dose-limiting toxicities encountered.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, vdc- <dig> has significant anti-tumor activity at well-tolerated doses in spontaneous canine mm.
