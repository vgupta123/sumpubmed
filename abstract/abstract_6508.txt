BACKGROUND
mitochondrial introns intermit coding regions of genes and feature characteristic secondary structures and splicing mechanisms. in metazoans, mitochondrial introns have only been detected in sponges, cnidarians, placozoans and one annelid species. within demosponges, group i and group ii introns are present in six families. based on different insertion sites within the cox <dig> gene and secondary structures, four types of group i and two types of group ii introns are known, which can harbor up to three encoding homing endonuclease genes  of the laglidadg family  and/or reverse transcriptase . however, only little is known about sponge intron mobility, transmission, and origin due to the lack of a comprehensive dataset. we analyzed the largest dataset on sponge mitochondrial group i introns to date:  <dig> specimens, from  <dig> different sponge genera which provided novel insights into the evolution of group i introns.


RESULTS
for the first time group i introns were detected in four genera of the sponge family scleritodermidae . we demonstrated that group i introns in sponges aggregate in the most conserved regions of cox <dig>  we showed that co-occurrence of two introns in cox <dig> is unique among metazoans, but not uncommon in sponges. however, this combination always associates an active intron with a degenerating one. earlier hypotheses of hgt were confirmed and for the first time vgt and secondary losses of introns conclusively demonstrated.


CONCLUSIONS
this study validates the subclass spirophorina  as an intron hotspot in sponges. our analyses confirm that most sponge group i introns probably originated from fungi. dna barcoding is discussed and the application of alternative primers suggested.
