BACKGROUND
aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase  is a key enzyme involved in the biosynthetic pathway of fatty alknes in cyanobacteria. however, cado  showed extreme low activity with the k
cat value below 1 min− <dig>  which would limit its application in biofuel production. to identify the activity related key residues of cado is urgently required.


RESULTS
the amino acid residues which might affect cado activity were identified based on the crystal structures and sequence alignment of cados, including the residues close to the di-iron center , the protein surface , and those involved in two important hydrogen bonds  and in the oligopeptide whose conformation changed in the absence of the di-iron center . the variants of cado- <dig> from synechococcus elongatus pcc <dig> and cado-sll <dig> from synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> were constructed, overexpressed, purified and kinetically characterized. the k
cat values of l146t, q49h/n123h/f150y and w178r of cado- <dig> and l148r of cado-sll <dig> were increased by more than two-fold, whereas that of r62a dropped by  <dig> %. n123h, y39f and d143a of cado- <dig>  and y150f of cado-sll <dig> reduced activities by ≤ 20%.


CONCLUSIONS
some important amino acids, which exerted some effects on cado activity, were identified. several enzyme variants exhibited greatly reduced activity, while the k
cat values of several mutants are more than two-fold higher than the wild type. this study presents the report on the relationship between amino acid residues and enzyme activity of cados, and the information will provide a guide for enhancement of cado activity through protein engineering.
