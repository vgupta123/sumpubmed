BACKGROUND
ammonium is one of the major forms in which nitrogen is available for plant growth. osamt1; <dig> is a high-affinity ammonium transporter in rice , responsible for ammonium uptake at low nitrogen concentration. the expression pattern of the gene has been reported. however, variations in its nucleotides and the evolutionary pathway of its descent from wild progenitors are yet to be elucidated. in this study, nucleotide diversity of the gene osamt1; <dig> and the diversity pattern of seven gene fragments spanning a genomic region approximately  <dig> kb long surrounding the gene were surveyed by sequencing a panel of  <dig> rice accessions including both cultivated rice and wild relatives.


RESULTS
nucleotide polymorphism  of osamt1; <dig> was as low as  <dig>  in cultivated rice , only  <dig> % of that in the common wild rice . a single dominant haplotype was fixed at the locus in o. sativa. the test values for neutrality were significantly negative in the entire region stretching 5' upstream and 3' downstream of the gene in all accessions. the value of linkage disequilibrium remained high across a  <dig> kb genomic region around osamt1; <dig> in o. sativa, but fell rapidly in o. rufipogon on either side of the promoter of osamt1; <dig>  demonstrating a strong natural selection within or nearby the ammonium transporter.


CONCLUSIONS
the severe reduction in nucleotide variation at osamt1; <dig> in rice was caused by a selective sweep around osamt1; <dig>  which may reflect the nitrogen uptake system under strong selection by the paddy soil during the domestication of rice. purifying selection also occurred before the wild rice diverged into its two subspecies, namely indica and japonica. these findings would provide useful insights into the processes of evolution and domestication of nitrogen uptake genes in rice.
