BACKGROUND
the conventional degumming process of ramie with alkaline treatment at high temperature causes severe environmental pollution. pectate lyases can be used to remove pectin from ramie in a degumming process with reduced environmental pollution and energy consumption. pectate lyase pel <dig> from bacillus subtilis has been previously characterized and the protein structure was resolved. however, bacillus is not a suitable host for pectate lyases during the degumming process since most bacillus produce cellulases endogenously with a detrimental effect to the fiber. pichia pastoris, which does not express endogenous cellulases and has high secretion capability, will be an ideal host for the expression. no previous work was reported concerning the heterologous expression of pectate lyase pel <dig> in p. pastoris with an aim for industrial application in ramie bio-degumming.


RESULTS
the gene pel <dig> was expressed in p. pastoris in this study. the recombinant protein pel <dig> in p. pastoris  showed two bands of  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda on sds-page whereas the enzyme expressed in e. coli  was the same as predicted with a band of  <dig> kda. deglycosylation digestion suggested that pel168p was glycosylated. the optimum reaction temperature of the two pel168s was 50°c, and the optimum ph  <dig> . after preincubation at 60°c for  <dig> min, pel168e completely lost its activity, whereas pel168p kept 26% of the residual activity. pel168p had a specific activity of  <dig> u/mg with a km of  <dig>  mg/ml and a vmax of  <dig>  μmol/min. k+, li+, ni2+ and sr2+ showed little or no inhibitory effect on pel168p activity, and ca2+ enhanced enzyme activity by 38%. pel168p can remove the pectin from ramie effectively in a degumming process. a  <dig>  fold increase of pel <dig> enzyme expression in p. pastoris was achieved by further codon optimization.


CONCLUSIONS
pectate lyase pel <dig> with an available protein structure can be heterologously expressed in p. pastoris. the characterized recombinant pel168p can be used to remove pectin from ramie efficiently and the expression level of pel <dig> in p. pastoris was increased markedly by codon optimization. therefore, pel <dig> is an ideal candidate for further optimization and engineering for bio-degumming.
