BACKGROUND
in recent years genome sequencing has been used to characterize new bacterial species, a method of analysis available as a result of improved methodology and reduced cost. included in a constantly expanding list of vibrio species are several that have been reclassified as novel members of the vibrionaceae. the description of two putative new vibrio species, vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> for which we propose the names v. metecus and v. parilis, respectively, previously characterized as non-toxigenic environmental variants of v. cholerae is presented in this study.


RESULTS
based on results of whole-genome average nucleotide identity , average amino acid identity , rpob similarity, mlsa, and phylogenetic analysis, the new species are concluded to be phylogenetically closely related to v. cholerae and v. mimicus. vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> demonstrate features characteristic of v. cholerae and v. mimicus, respectively, on differential and selective media, but their genomes show a  <dig> to 15% divergence  compared to the sequences of v. cholerae and v. mimicus genomes . vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> share  <dig> orfs  and  <dig> orfs  with the published core genome of v. cholerae and  <dig>  and  <dig> orfs  with v. mimicus mb- <dig>  respectively. the novel species share  <dig> orfs with each other . virulence-associated factors and genomic islands of v. cholerae and v. mimicus, including vsp-i and ii, were found in these environmental vibrio spp.


CONCLUSIONS
results of this analysis demonstrate these two environmental vibrios, previously characterized as variant v. cholerae strains, are new species which have evolved from ancestral lineages of the v. cholerae and v. mimicus clade. the presence of conserved integration loci for genomic islands as well as evidence of horizontal gene transfer between these two new species, v. cholerae, and v. mimicus suggests genomic islands and virulence factors are transferred between these species.
