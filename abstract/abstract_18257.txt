BACKGROUND
during infection and inflammation, circulating blood monocytes migrate from the intravascular compartments to the extravascular compartments, where they mature into tissue macrophages. the maturation process prepares the cells to actively participate in the inflammatory and immune responses, and many factors have been reported to be involved in the process. we found in our study that cd <dig> played a very important role in this process.


RESULTS
by using pma-differentiated human monocyte cells line thp- <dig>  we found that cd <dig> mediated matrix metalloproteinases  expression of the leukemic thp- <dig> cells and thus enhanced the invasiveness of thp- <dig> cells. after  <dig> hours of pma-induced monocyte differentiation, the mean fluorescence intensity of cd <dig> in differentiated thp- <dig> cells  was higher than that of the undifferentiated thp- <dig> cells . there was a significant increase of the levels of prommp- <dig>  prommp- <dig> and their activated forms in the differentiated thp- <dig> cells. invasion assays using reconstituted basement membrane showed a good correlation between the invasiveness of thp- <dig> cells and the production of mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig>  the difference in the mmps expression and the invasive ability was significantly blocked by hab18g/cd <dig> antagonistic peptide ap- <dig>  the inhibitory rate of the secretion of prommp- <dig> in the undifferentiated thp- <dig> cells was  <dig> %. the inhibitory rate of the secretion of prommp- <dig>  the activated mmp- <dig> and prommp- <dig> in the differentiated thp- <dig> cells was  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the inhibitory rate of invasive potential in the undifferentiated cells and the differentiated thp- <dig> cells was  <dig>  % and  <dig> %, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that the expression of cd <dig> is upregulated during the differentiation of monocyte thp- <dig> cells to macrophage cells, and cd <dig> induces the secretion and activation of mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> and enhances the invasive ability of thp- <dig> cells. the matured monocytes / macrophages, via their high expression of cd <dig>  may play an important role in promoting the tissue repair or tissue damage during their inflammatory response.
