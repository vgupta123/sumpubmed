BACKGROUND
long-term amphetamine and methamphetamine dependence has been linked to cerebral blood perfusion, metabolic, and white matter abnormalities. several studies have linked methamphetamine abuse to cortical grey matter reduction, though with divergent findings. few publications investigate unmethylated amphetamine's potential effects on cortical grey matter. this work investigated if amphetamine dependent patients showed reduced cortical grey matter thickness. subjects were  <dig> amphetamine dependent subjects and  <dig> healthy controls. while all subjects were recruited to be free of alcohol dependence, structured clinical interviews revealed significant patterns of alcohol use in the patients. structural magnetic resonance brain images were obtained from the subjects using a  <dig>  tesla ge signa machine. brain cortical thickness was measured with submillimeter precision at multiple finely spaced cortical locations using semi-automated post-processing . contrast analysis of a general linear model was used to test for differences between the two groups at each cortical location. in addition to contrasting patients with controls, a number of analyses sought to identify possible confounding effects from alcohol.


RESULTS
no significant cortical thickness differences were observed between the full patient group and controls, nor between non-drinking patients and controls. patients with a history of co-morbid heavy alcohol use  showed reductions in the superior-frontal right hemisphere and pre-central left hemisphere when compared to healthy controls .


CONCLUSIONS
amphetamine usage was associated with reduced cortical thickness only in patients co-morbid for heavy alcohol use. since cortical thickness is but one measure of brain structure and does not capture brain function, further studies of brain structure and function in amphetamine dependence are warranted.
