BACKGROUND
yellow mustard  is an important condiment crop for the spice trade in the world. it has lagged behind oilseed brassica species in molecular marker development and application. intron length polymorphism  markers are highly polymorphic, co-dominant and cost-effective. the cross-species applicability of ilp markers from brassica species and arabidopsis makes them possible to be used for genetic linkage mapping and further qtl analysis of agronomic traits in yellow mustard.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> ilp and  <dig> ssr markers were mapped on  <dig> linkage groups and designated as sal01- <dig> in yellow mustard. the constructed map covered a total genetic length of  <dig>  cm with an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm. the qtl for erucic content co-localized with the fatty acid elongase  <dig>  gene on sal <dig>  the self-compatibility gene was assigned to sal <dig>  the 4-hydroxybenzyl, 3-indolylmethyl and 4-hydroxy-3-indolylmethyl glucosinolate contents were each controlled by one major qtl, all of which were located on sal <dig>  two qtls, accounting for the respective  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total variation of 2-hydroxy-3-butenyl glucosinolate content, were identified and mapped to sal <dig> and sal <dig>  comparative synteny analysis revealed that yellow mustard was phylogenetically related to arabidopsis thaliana and had undergone extensive chromosomal rearrangements during speciation.


CONCLUSIONS
the linkage map based on ilp and ssr markers was constructed and used for qtl analysis of seed quality traits in yellow mustard. the markers tightly linked with the genes for different glucosinolate components will be used for marker-assisted selection and map-based cloning. the ilp markers and linkage map provide useful molecular tools for yellow mustard breeding.
