BACKGROUND
bacteriophage lambda is a model phage for most other dsdna phages and has been studied for over  <dig> years. although it is probably the best-characterized phage there are still about  <dig> poorly understood open reading frames in its 48-kb genome. for a complete understanding we need to know all interactions among its proteins. we have manually curated the lambda literature and compiled a total of  <dig> interactions that have been found among lambda proteins. we set out to find out how many protein-protein interactions remain to be found in this phage.


RESULTS
in order to map lambda's interactions, we have cloned  <dig> out of  <dig> lambda open reading frames  into gateway vectors and systematically tested all proteins for interactions using exhaustive array-based yeast two-hybrid screens. these screens identified  <dig> interactions. we found  <dig> out of  <dig> previously published interactions . we have also found at least  <dig> new plausible interactions among functionally related proteins. all previously found and new interactions are combined into structural and network models of phage lambda.


CONCLUSIONS
phage lambda serves as a benchmark for future studies of protein interactions among phage, viruses in general, or large protein assemblies. we conclude that we could not find all the known interactions because they require chaperones, post-translational modifications, or multiple proteins for their interactions. the lambda protein network connects  <dig> proteins of unknown function with well characterized proteins, which should shed light on the functional associations of these uncharacterized proteins.
