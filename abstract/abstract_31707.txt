BACKGROUND
neurogenic pulmonary edema  is a non-cardiogenic form of pulmonary edema that can occur consequent to central neurologic insults including stroke, traumatic brain injury, and seizure. npe is a public health concern due to high morbidity and mortality, yet the mechanism are unknown. we hypothesized that npe, evoked by cerebral hypoxia in the presence of systemic normoxia, would be accompanied by sympathetic activation, oxidative stress, and compensatory antioxidant mechanisms.

methods
thirteen walker hounds were assigned to cerebral hypoxia  with systemic normoxia  , cerebral and systemic  hypoxia  , or cerebral and systemic normoxia  . femoral venous  perfusate was delivered via cardiopulmonary bypass to the brain and gh was induced by fio2 = 10 % to maintain the sao <dig> at ~60 %. lung wet to lung dry weight ratios  were assessed as an index of pulmonary edema in addition to hemodynamic measurements. plasma catecholamines were measured as markers of sympathetic nervous system  activity. total glutathione, protein carbonyls, and malondialdehyde were assessed as indicators of oxidative stress. brain and lung compensatory antioxidants were measured with immunoblotting.


RESULTS
compared to con, lww/ldw and pulmonary artery pressure were greater in ch and gh. expression of hemeoxygenase- <dig> in brain was higher in ch compared to gh and con, despite no group differences in oxidative damage in any tissue. catecholamines tended to be higher in ch and gh.


CONCLUSIONS
cerebral hypoxia, with systemic normoxia, is not systematically associated with an increase in oxidative stress and compensatory antioxidant enzymes in lung, suggesting oxidative stress did not contribute to npe in lung. however, increased sns activity may play a role in the induction of npe during hypoxia.
