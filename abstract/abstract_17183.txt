BACKGROUND
the physiopathological mechanism underlying the tinnitus phenomenon is still the subject of an ongoing debate. since oscillatory eeg activity is increasingly recognized as a fundamental hallmark of cortical integrative functions, this study investigates deviations from the norm of different resting eeg parameters in patients suffering from chronic tinnitus.


RESULTS
spectral parameters of resting eeg of male tinnitus patients  were compared to those of age-matched healthy males . on average, the patient group exhibited higher spectral power over the frequency range of 2- <dig> hz. using loreta source analysis, the generators of delta, theta, alpha and beta power increases were localized dominantly to left auditory   <dig> , 22), temporo-parietal, insular posterior, cingulate anterior and parahippocampal cortical areas.


CONCLUSIONS
tinnitus patients show a deviation from the norm of different resting eeg parameters, characterized by an overproduction of resting state delta, theta and beta brain activities, providing further support for the microphysiological and magnetoencephalographic evidence pointing to a thalamocortical dysrhythmic process at the source of tinnitus. these results also provide further confirmation that reciprocal involvements of both auditory and associative/paralimbic areas are essential in the generation of tinnitus.
