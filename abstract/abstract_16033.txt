BACKGROUND
oncogene hccr- <dig> functions as a negative regulator of the p <dig> and contributes to tumorigenesis of various human tissues. however, it is unknown how hccr- <dig> contributes to the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of human tumorigenesis.


RESULTS
in this study, we showed how the expression of hccr- <dig> is modulated. the luciferase activity assay indicated that the hccr- <dig> 5'-flanking region at positions - <dig> to + <dig> plays an important role in hccr- <dig> promoter activity. computational analysis of this region identified two consensus sequences for the t-cell factor  located at - <dig> to - <dig>  and - <dig> to - <dig> . mutation at the tcf <dig> site led to a dramatic decrease in promoter activity. mobility shift assays  revealed that nuclear proteins bind to the tcf <dig> site, but not to the tcf <dig> site. licl, wnt signal activator by gsk-3β inhibition, significantly increased reporter activities in wild-type tcf1-containing constructs, but were without effect in mutant tcf1-containing constructs in hek/ <dig> cells. in addition, endogenous hccr- <dig> expression was also increased by treatment with gsk-3β inhibitor, licl or ar-a <dig> in hek/ <dig> and k <dig> cells. finally, we also observed that the transcription factor, tcf, and its cofactor, β-catenin, bound to the tcf <dig> site.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that the tcf <dig> site on the hccr- <dig> promoter is a major element regulating hccr- <dig> expression and abnormal stimulation of this site may induce various human cancers.
