BACKGROUND
single-molecule techniques have emerged as incisive approaches for addressing a wide range of questions arising in contemporary biological research . the analysis and interpretation of raw single-molecule data benefits greatly from the ongoing development of sophisticated statistical analysis tools that enable accurate inference at the low signal-to-noise ratios frequently associated with these measurements. while a number of groups have released analysis toolkits as open source software , it remains difficult to compare analysis for experiments performed in different labs due to a lack of standardization.


RESULTS
here we propose a standardized single-molecule dataset  file format. smd is designed to accommodate a wide variety of computer programming languages, single-molecule techniques, and analysis strategies. to facilitate adoption of this format we have made two existing data analysis packages that are used for single-molecule analysis compatible with this format.


CONCLUSIONS
adoption of a common, standard data file format for sharing raw single-molecule data and analysis outcomes is a critical step for the emerging and powerful single-molecule field, which will benefit both sophisticated users and non-specialists by allowing standardized, transparent, and reproducible analysis practices.
