BACKGROUND
sheepgrass  is an important perennial forage grass across the eurasian steppe and is adaptable to various environmental conditions, but little is known about its molecular mechanism responding to grazing and bsa deposition. because it has a large genome, rna sequencing is expensive and impractical except for the next-generation sequencing  technology.


RESULTS
in this study, ngs technology was employed to characterize de novo the transcriptome of sheepgrass after defoliation and grazing treatments and to identify differentially expressed genes  responding to grazing and bsa deposition. we assembled more than 47 m high-quality reads into  <dig>  contigs from seven sequenced libraries. based on the assembled transcriptome, we detected  <dig>  degs responding to bsa deposition during grazing. enrichment analysis of gene ontology , eukaryotic orthologous groups  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways revealed that the effects of grazing and bsa deposition involved more apoptosis and cell oxidative changes compared to defoliation. analysis of dna fragments, cell oxidative factors and the lengths of leaf scars after grazing provided physiological and morphological evidence that bsa deposition during grazing alters the oxidative and apoptotic status of cells.


CONCLUSIONS
this research greatly enriches sheepgrass transcriptome resources and grazing-stress-related genes, helping us to better understand the molecular mechanism of grazing in sheepgrass. the grazing-stress-related genes and pathways will be a valuable resource for further gene-phenotype studies.
