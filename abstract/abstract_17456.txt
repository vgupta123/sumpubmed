BACKGROUND
myostatin, a muscle-specific member of the transforming growth factor beta family, negatively regulates muscle development. double-muscled  cattle have a loss-of-function mutation in their myostatin gene responsible for the hypermuscular phenotype. thus, these animals are a good model for understanding the mechanisms underpinning muscular hypertrophy. in order to identify individual genes or networks that may be myostatin targets, we looked for genes that were differentially expressed between dm and normal  animals  in the semitendinosus muscle  at  <dig> days of fetal development . a heterologous microarray  of around  <dig>  genes expressed in muscle was used.


RESULTS
many genes were found to be differentially expressed according to genetic type , and according to the presence of one or two functional myostatin allele. they belonged to various functional categories. the genes down-regulated in dm fetuses were mainly those encoding extracellular matrix proteins, slow contractile proteins and ribosomal proteins. the genes up-regulated in dm fetuses were mainly involved in the regulation of transcription, cell cycle/apoptosis, translation or dna metabolism. these data highlight features indicating that dm muscle is shifted towards a more glycolytic metabolism, and has an altered extracellular matrix composition  and decreased adipocyte differentiation . the altered gene expression in the three major muscle compartments  is consistent with the well-known characteristics of dm cattle. in addition, novel potential targets of the myostatin gene were identified .


CONCLUSIONS
thus, the myostatin loss-of-function mutation affected several physiological processes involved in the development and determination of the functional characteristics of muscle tissue.
