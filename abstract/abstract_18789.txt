BACKGROUND
burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent for melioidosis, a disease with significant mortality and morbidity in endemic regions. its versatility as a pathogen is reflected in its relatively huge  <dig>  mb genome and the presence of many virulence factors including three type three secretion systems known as t3ss <dig>  t3ss <dig> and t3ss <dig>  besides being a human pathogen, it is able to infect and cause disease in many different animals and alternative hosts such as c. elegans.


RESULTS
its host range is further extended to include plants as we demonstrated the ability of b. pseudomallei and the closely related species b. thailandensis to infect susceptible tomato but not rice plants. bacteria were found to multiply intercellularly and were found in the xylem vessels of the vascular bundle. disease is substantially attenuated upon infection with bacterial mutants deficient in t3ss <dig> or t3ss <dig> and slightly attenuated upon infection with the t3ss <dig> mutant. this shows the importance of both t3ss <dig> and t3ss <dig> in bacterial pathogenesis in susceptible plants.


CONCLUSIONS
the potential of b. pseudomallei as a plant pathogen raises new possibilities of exploiting plant as an alternative host for novel anti-infectives or virulence factor discovery. it also raises issues of biosecurity due to its classification as a potential bioterrorism agent.
