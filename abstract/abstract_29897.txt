BACKGROUND
macrohaplogroups 'm' and 'n' have evolved almost in parallel from a founder haplogroup l <dig>  macrohaplogroup n in india has already been defined in previous studies and recently the macrohaplogroup m among the indian populations has been characterized. in this study, we attempted to reconstruct and re-evaluate the phylogeny of macrohaplogroup m, which harbors more than 60% of the indian mtdna lineage, and to shed light on the origin of its deep rooting haplogroups.


RESULTS
using  <dig> whole mtdna and  <dig> partial coding sequence of indian m lineage selected from  <dig> hvs <dig> sequences across india, we have reconstructed the tree including andamanese-specific lineage m <dig> and calculated the time depth of all the nodes. we defined one novel haplogroup m <dig>  and revised the classification of haplogroups m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our result indicates that the indian mtdna pool consists of several deep rooting lineages of macrohaplogroup 'm' suggesting in-situ origin of these haplogroups in south asia, most likely in the india. these deep rooting lineages are not language specific and spread over all the language groups in india. moreover, our reanalysis of the andamanese-specific lineage m <dig> suggests population specific two clear-cut subclades . onge and jarwa share m31a <dig> branch while m31a <dig> clade is present in only great andamanese individuals. overall our study supported the one wave, rapid dispersal theory of modern humans along the asian coast.
