BACKGROUND
ccl <dig> is a well-established hepatotoxin inducing liver injury by producing free radicals. exposure to ccl <dig> also induces acute and chronic renal injuries. the present study was designed to establish the protective effect of hesperidin , a citrus bioflavonoid, on ccl4-induced oxidative stress and resultant dysfunction of rat liver and kidney.

methods
animals were pretreated with hdn  for one week and then challenged with ccl <dig>  in olive oil. rats were sacrificed by carotid bleeding under ether anesthesia. liver enzymes, urea and creatinine were estimated in serum. oxidative stress in liver and kidney tissue was estimated using thiobarbituric acid reactive substances , glutathione  content, superoxide dismutase, and catalase 


RESULTS
ccl <dig> caused a marked rise in serum levels of alt and ast . tbars levels were significantly increased whereas gsh, sod and cat levels decreased in the liver and kidney homogenates of ccl <dig> treated rats. hdn  successfully attenuated these effects of ccl4


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our study demonstrated a protective effect of hdn in ccl <dig> induced oxidative stress in rat liver and kidney. this protective effect of hdn can be correlated to its direct antioxidant effect.
