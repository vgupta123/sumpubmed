BACKGROUND
osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from a common mesenchymal progenitor and an inverse relationship between expression of the two lineages is seen with certain experimental manipulations and in certain diseases, i.e., osteoporosis, but the cellular pathway and developmental stages underlying the inverse relationship is still under active investigation. to determine which precursor mesenchymal cell types can differentiate into adipocytes, we compared the effects of brl- <dig> , a selective ligand for peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ, a master transcription factor of adipogenesis, on osteo/adipogeneis in two different osteoblast culture models: the rat bone marrow  versus the fetal rat calvaria  cell system.


RESULTS
brl increased the number of adipocytes and corresponding marker expression, such as lipoprotein lipase, fatty acid-binding protein , and adipsin, in both culture models, but affected osteoblastogenesis only in rbm cultures, where a reciprocal decrease in bone nodule formation and osteoblast markers, e.g., osteopontin, alkaline phosphatase , bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin was seen, and not in rc cell cultures. even though adipocytes were histologically undetectable in rc cultures not treated with brl, rc cells expressed ppar and ccaat/enhancer binding protein  mrnas throughout osteoblast development and their expression was increased by brl. some single cell-derived brl-treated osteogenic rc colonies were stained not only with alp/von kossa but also with oil red o and co-expressed the mature adipocyte marker adipsin and the mature osteoblast marker ocn, as well as ppar and c/ebp mrnas.


CONCLUSIONS
the data show that there are clear differences in the capacity of brl to alter the fate choices of precursor cells in stromal  versus calvarial  cell populations and that recruitment of adipocytes can occur from multiple precursor cell pools ). they also show that mechanisms beyond activation of pparγ by its ligand are required for changing the fate of committed osteoprogenitor cells and/or osteoblasts into adipocytes.
