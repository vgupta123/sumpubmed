BACKGROUND
bovine enterovirus  belongs to the species enterovirus e or f, genus enterovirus and family picornaviridae. although numerous studies have identified bevs in the feces of cattle with diarrhea, the pathogenicity of bevs remains unclear. previously, we reported the detection of novel kobu-like virus in calf feces, by metagenomics analysis. in the present study, we identified a novel bev in diarrheal feces collected for that survey. complete genome sequences were determined by deep sequencing in feces. secondary rna structure analysis of the 5′ untranslated region , phylogenetic tree construction and pairwise identity analysis were conducted.


RESULTS
the complete genome sequences of bev were genetically distant from other evs and the vp <dig> coding region contained novel and unique amino acid sequences. we named this strain as bev an12/bos taurus/jpn/ <dig> . according to genome analysis, the genome length of this virus is  <dig> nucleotides excluding the poly  tail and its genome consists of a 5′utr, open reading frame encoding a single polyprotein, and 3′utr. the results of secondary rna structure analysis showed that in the 5′utr, bev-an <dig> had an additional clover leaf structure and small stem loop structure, similarly to other bevs. in pairwise identity analysis, bev-an <dig> showed high amino acid  identities to enterovirus f in the polyprotein, p <dig> and p <dig> regions . therefore, bev-an <dig> is closely related to enterovirus f. however, aa sequences in the capsid protein regions, particularly the vp <dig> encoding region, showed significantly low aa identity to other viruses in genus enterovirus . in addition, bev-an <dig> branched separately from enterovirus e and f in phylogenetic trees based on the aa sequences of p <dig> and vp <dig>  although it clustered with enterovirus f in trees based on sequences in the p <dig> and p <dig> genome region.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified novel bev possessing highly divergent aa sequences in the vp <dig> coding region in japan. according to species definition, we proposed naming this strain as “enterovirus k”, which is a novel species within genus enterovirus. further genomic studies are needed to understand the pathogenicity of bevs.
