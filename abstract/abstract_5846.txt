BACKGROUND
the entry of calcium ions into mammary gland epithelial cells is one of the least well-understood processes in the transport of calcium into milk during lactation. the store-operated calcium entry channel orai <dig>  has been suggested as a potential mechanism for the entry of ca2+ into mammary gland epithelial cells from the maternal blood supply during lactation. the down regulation of the canonical orai <dig> activator stim <dig> during lactation suggests that other known orai activators such as stim <dig> and spca <dig> may be important during lactation.


RESULTS
differentiation of hc <dig> mammary gland epithelial cells was associated with enhanced basal ca2+ influx. silencing of orai <dig> abolished this enhancement of ca2+ influx. stim <dig> had a modest effect on ca2+ influx in this in vitro model of lactation, whereas stim <dig> and spca <dig> silencing had no effect. despite pronounced increases in spca <dig> mrna during lactation there was no change in the generation of the alternative splice product generated by mist <dig>  which increases during lactation.


CONCLUSIONS
these studies support the hypothesis that lactation is associated with a remodelling of ca2+ influx and this is associated with enhancement of basal ca2+ influx. this enhanced ca2+ influx appears to occur through the calcium channel orai <dig>
