BACKGROUND
gene expression changes induced by carcinogens may identify differences in molecular function between target and non-target organs. target organs for benzopyrene  carcinogenicity in mice  and three non-target organs  were investigated for dna adducts by 32p-postlabelling, for gene expression changes by cdna microarray and for mirna expression changes by mirna microarray after exposure of animals to bap.


RESULTS
bap-dna adduct formation occurred in all six organs at levels that did not distinguish between target and non-target. cdna microarray analysis showed a variety of genes modulated significantly by bap in the six organs and the overall gene expression patterns were tissue specific. gene ontology analysis also revealed that bap-induced bioactivities were tissue specific; eight genes  showed significant expression difference between three target and three non-target organs. additionally, several gene expression changes, such as in trp <dig> activation and stat <dig> activity suggested some similarities in molecular mechanisms in two target organs , which were not found in the other four organs. changes in mirna expression were generally tissue specific, involving, in total, 21/ <dig> mirnas significantly up- or down-regulated.


CONCLUSIONS
altogether, these findings showed that dna adduct levels and early gene expression changes did not fully distinguish target from non-target organs. however, mechanisms related to early changes in p <dig>  stat <dig> and wnt/β-catenin pathways may play roles in defining bap organotropism.
