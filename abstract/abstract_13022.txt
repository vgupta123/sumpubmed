BACKGROUND
the genome of bacillus licheniformis dsm  <dig> harbours three neighbouring open reading frames showing protein sequence similarities to the proteins encoded from the bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis  <dig> gera operon, geraa, gerab and gerac. in b. subtilis, these proteins are assumed to form a germinant receptor involved in spore germination induced by the amino acid l-alanine.


RESULTS
in this study we show that disruption of the geraa gene in b. licheniformis mw <dig> hamper l-alanine and casein hydrolysate-triggered spore germination, measured by absorbance at  <dig> nm and confirmed by phase contrast microscopy. this ability was restored by complementation with a plasmid-borne copy of the gera locus. addition of d-alanine in the casein hydrolysate germination assay abolished germination of both b. licheniformis mw <dig> and the complementation mutant. germination of both b. licheniformis mw <dig> and the gera disruption mutant was induced by the non-nutrient germinant ca2+-dipicolinic acid.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate that the b. licheniformis mw <dig> gera locus is involved in germination induced by l-alanine and potentially other components present in casein hydrolysate.
