BACKGROUND
cellular atp levels are generated by glucose-stimulated mitochondrial metabolism and determine metabolic responses, such as glucose-stimulated insulin secretion  from the Î²-cells of pancreatic islets. we describe an analysis of the evolutionary processes affecting the core enzymes involved in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in mammals. the proteins involved in this system belong to ancient enzymatic pathways: glycolysis, the tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.


RESULTS
we identify two sets of proteins, or protein coalitions, in this group of  <dig> enzymes with distinct evolutionary patterns. members of the glycolysis, tca cycle, metabolite transport, pyruvate and nadh shuttles have low rates of protein sequence evolution, as inferred from a human-mouse comparison, and relatively high rates of evolutionary gene duplication. respiratory chain and glutathione pathway proteins evolve faster, exhibiting lower rates of gene duplication. a small number of proteins in the system evolve significantly faster than co-pathway members and may serve as rapidly evolving adapters, linking groups of co-evolving genes.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide insights into the evolution of the involved proteins. we find evidence for two coalitions of proteins and the role of co-adaptation in protein evolution is identified and could be used in future research within a functional context.
