BACKGROUND
alu elements are a family of sine retrotransposons in primates. they are classified into subfamilies according to specific diagnostic mutations from the general alu consensus. it is now believed that there may be several retrotranspositionally-competent source genes within an alu subfamily. in this study, subfamilies falling on the aluyi and aluyh lineages, and the aluyg <dig> subfamily, are assessed for the presence of secondary source genes, and the influence of gene conversion on the aluyh and aluyi lineages is also described.


RESULTS
the aluyh <dig> and aluyi <dig> subfamilies appear to contain multiple source genes. the novel subfamilies aluyh3a <dig> and aluyh3a <dig> are described, for which there is no convincing evidence to suggest the presence of secondary sources. the mutational substructure of aluyh3a <dig> can be explained completely by inference of single master gene. a complete backwards gene conversion event appears to have inactivated the aluyh3a <dig> master gene in humans. polymorphism data suggest a larger number of secondary source elements may be active in the aluyg <dig> family than previously thought.


CONCLUSIONS
it is clear that there is considerable variation in the number of source genes present in each of the young alu subfamilies. this can range from a single master source gene, as for aluyh3a <dig>  to as many as  <dig> source elements in aluyi <dig>
