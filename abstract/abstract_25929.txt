BACKGROUND
various software tools are available for the display of pairwise linkage disequilibrium across multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms. the hapmap project also presents these graphics within their website. however, these approaches are limited in their use of data from multiallelic markers and provide limited information in a graphical form.


RESULTS
we have developed a software package  for the estimation and graphical display of interallelic linkage disequilibrium. linkage disequilibrium is analysed for each allelic combination , between all pairwise combinations of any type of multiallelic loci in a contig  of many loci . data are presented graphically in a novel and informative way, and can also be exported in tabular form for other analyses. this approach facilitates visualisation of patterns of linkage disequilibrium across genomic regions, analysis of the relationships between different alleles of multiallelic markers and inferences about patterns of evolution and selection.


CONCLUSIONS
midas is a linkage disequilibrium analysis program with a comprehensive graphical user interface providing novel views of patterns of linkage disequilibrium between all types of multiallelic and biallelic markers.
