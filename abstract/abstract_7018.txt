BACKGROUND
the benefit of pre and post-operative administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the relief of post-operative pain and control of inflammation in horses following orthopaedic surgery has not been previously investigated in controlled clinical field trials, and the utility of such treatment is a matter of ongoing dispute. recently the utility of post-operative pain management was emphasized. it was therefore our aim to determine the efficacy of meloxicam in horses following partial resection of fractured splint bones. this condition was selected since the limited extent of the insult and the defined surgical intervention allowed the conduct of a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multi-centre clinical field study in a homogenous patient population.


RESULTS
sixty-six client owned horses requiring unilateral partial splint bone resection were recruited in  <dig> centres in germany and were allocated in a 1: <dig> ratio to receive meloxicam,  <dig>  mg/kg for 5 days.

lameness at trot grades prior to surgery were similar in the meloxicam and placebo treatment groups but were significantly lower in the meloxicam group on day  <dig> post surgery. clinical scores for soft tissue swelling and assessment of analgesic and anti-inflammatory efficacy by the investigators at the end of the study were significantly better for the meloxicam compared to the placebo group. no treatment-related adverse reactions were observed.


CONCLUSIONS
the administration of meloxicam i.v. once prior to surgery followed by once daily oral administration for four consecutive days is efficacious for the control of post-operative pain and inflammation in horses undergoing orthopaedic surgery.
