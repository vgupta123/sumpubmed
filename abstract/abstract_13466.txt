BACKGROUND
due to broad range of clinical and industrial applications of cholesterol oxidase, isolation and screening of bacterial strains producing extracellular form of cholesterol oxidase is of great importance.


RESULTS
one hundred and thirty actinomycete isolates were screened for their cholesterol oxidase activity. among them, a potential culture, strain neae- <dig> is displayed the highest extracellular cholesterol oxidase activity. it was selected and identified as streptomyces cavourensis strain neae- <dig>  the optimization of different process parameters for cholesterol oxidase production by streptomyces cavourensis strain neae- <dig> using plackett–burman experimental design and response surface methodology was carried out. fifteen variables were screened using plackett–burman experimental design. cholesterol, initial ph and 2so <dig> were the most significant positive independent variables affecting cholesterol oxidase production. central composite design was chosen to elucidate the optimal concentrations of the selected process variables on cholesterol oxidase production. it was found that, cholesterol oxidase production by streptomyces cavourensis strain neae- <dig> after optimization process was  <dig> u/ml which is higher than result obtained from the basal medium before screening process using plackett-burman  with a fold of increase  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
the cholesterol oxidase level production obtained in this study  by the statistical method is higher than many of the reported values.
