BACKGROUND
there is an increasing interest to better understand endosymbiont capabilities in insects both from an ecological point of view and for pest control. blochmannia floridanus provides important nutrients for its host, the ant camponotus, while the bacterium in return is provided with a niche to proliferate. blochmannia floridanus proteins and metabolites are difficult to study due to its endosymbiontic life style; however, its complete genome sequence became recently available.


RESULTS
improved sequence analysis algorithms, databanks and gene and pathway context methods allowed us to reveal new information on various enzyme and pathways from the blochmannia floridanus genome sequence . furthermore, these predictions are supported and linked to experimental data for instance from structural genomics projects  or available biochemical data on proteins from other species which we show here to be related. we were able to assign a confirmed or at least a putative molecular function for  <dig> from  <dig> previously conserved hypothetical proteins. for  <dig> proteins of  <dig> with a previous putative assignment the function was further clarified. several of these proteins occur in many proteobacteria and are found to be conserved even in the compact genome of this endosymbiont. to extend and re-test predictions and links to experimentally verified protein functions, functional clusters and interactions were assembled. these included septum initiation and cell division ; translation; transport; the ubiquinone , the inositol and nitrogen pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data allow a better and more complete description of the pathway capabilities and life style of this typical endosymbiont.
