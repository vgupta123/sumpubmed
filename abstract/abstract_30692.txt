BACKGROUND
initiation of eukaryotic dna replication involves many protein-protein and protein-dna interactions. we have previously shown that 14-3- <dig> proteins bind cruciform dna and associate with mammalian and yeast replication origins in a cell cycle dependent manner.


RESULTS
by expressing the human 14-3-3ε, as the sole member of 14-3- <dig> proteins family in saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that 14-3-3ε complements the s. cerevisiae bmh1/bmh <dig> double knockout, conserves its cruciform binding activity, and associates in vivo with the yeast replication origins ars <dig>  deletion of the α5-helix, the potential cruciform binding domain of 14-3- <dig>  decreased the cruciform binding activity of the protein as well as its association with the yeast replication origins ars <dig> and ars <dig>  furthermore, the mutant cells had a reduced ability to stably maintain plasmids bearing one or multiple origins.


CONCLUSIONS
14-3- <dig>  a cruciform dna binding protein, associates with yeast origins of replication and functions as an initiator of dna replication, presumably through binding to cruciform dna forming at yeast replicators.
