BACKGROUND
accumulation of amyloid-β  peptide in the brain is thought to play a key pathological role in alzheimer's disease. many pharmacological targets have therefore been proposed based upon the biochemistry of aβ, but not all are equally tractable for drug discovery.


RESULTS
to search for novel targets that affect brain aβ without causing toxicity, we screened mouse brain samples from  <dig> novel gene knock-out  strains, representing  <dig> genes, using aβ elisa assays. although robust aβ lowering was readily apparent in brains from a bace <dig> ko strain, none of the novel strains exhibited robust decreases in brain aβ, including a gpr <dig> ko strain, which had previously been proposed as an aβ target. however, significantly increased aβ was observed in brain samples from two ko strains, corresponding to genes encoding the glycosylphosphatidylinositol mannosyl transferase pigz and quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase .


CONCLUSIONS
thus, gene ablations that are permissive for mouse survival and that also have a robust effect on aβ levels in the brain are rare.
