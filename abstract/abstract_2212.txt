BACKGROUND
the red recombinase system of bacteriophage lambda has been used to inactivate chromosomal genes in various bacteria and fungi. the procedure consists of electroporating a polymerase chain reaction  fragment that was obtained with a 1- or 3-step pcr protocol and that carries an antibiotic cassette flanked by a region homologous to the target locus into a strain that expresses the lambda red recombination system.


RESULTS
this system has been modified for use in pseudomonas aeruginosa. chromosomal dna deletions of single genes were generated using 3-step pcr products containing flanking regions 400â€“ <dig> nucleotides  in length that are homologous to the target sequence. a 1-step pcr product with a homologous extension flanking region of only  <dig> nt was in some cases sufficient to obtain the desired mutant. we further showed that the p. aeruginosa strain pa <dig> non-redundant transposon library can be used in conjunction with the lambda red technique to rapidly generate large chromosomal deletions or transfer mutated genes into various pa <dig> isogenic mutants to create multi-locus knockout mutants.


CONCLUSIONS
the lambda red-based technique can be used efficiently to generate mutants in p. aeruginosa. the main advantage of this procedure is its rapidity as mutants can be easily obtained in less than a week if the 3-step pcr procedure is used, or in less than three days if the mutation needs to be transferred from one strain to another.
