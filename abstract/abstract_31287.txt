BACKGROUND
high-protein diets  alter the large intestine microbiota composition in association with a metabolic shift towards protein degradation. some amino acid-derived metabolites produced by the colon bacteria are beneficial for the mucosa while others are deleterious at high concentrations. the aim of the present work was to define the colonic epithelial response to an hpd. transcriptome profiling was performed on colonocytes of rats fed an hpd or an isocaloric normal-protein diet  for 2 weeks.


RESULTS
the hpd downregulated the expression of genes notably implicated in pathways related to cellular metabolism, nf-κb signaling, dna repair, glutathione metabolism and cellular adhesion in colonocytes. in contrast, the hpd upregulated the expression of genes related to cell proliferation and chemical barrier function. these changes at the mrna level in colonocytes were not associated with detrimental effects of the hpd on dna integrity , epithelium renewal  and colonic barrier integrity .


CONCLUSIONS
the modifications of the luminal environment after an hpd were associated with maintenance of the colonic homeostasis that might be the result of adaptive processes in the epithelium related to the observed transcriptional regulations.
