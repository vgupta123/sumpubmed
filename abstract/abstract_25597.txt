BACKGROUND
although much is known about molecular mechanisms that prevent re-initiation of dna replication on newly replicated dna during a single cell cycle, knowledge is sparse regarding the regions that are most susceptible to re-replication when those mechanisms are bypassed and regarding the extents to which checkpoint pathways modulate re-replication. we used microarrays to learn more about these issues in wild-type and checkpoint-mutant cells of the fission yeast, schizosaccharomyces pombe.


RESULTS
we found that over-expressing a non-phosphorylatable form of the replication-initiation protein, cdc <dig> , drove re-replication of dna sequences genome-wide, rather than forcing high level amplification of just a few sequences. moderate variations in extents of re-replication generated regions spanning hundreds of kilobases that were amplified  ~2-fold more  than average. however, these regions showed little correlation with replication origins used during s phase. the extents and locations of amplified regions in cells deleted for the checkpoint genes encoding rad <dig>  and cds <dig>  were similar to those in wild-type cells. relatively minor but distinct effects, including increased re-replication of heterochromatic regions, were found specifically in cells lacking rad <dig>  these might be due to cds1-independent roles for rad <dig> in regulating re-replication and/or due to the fact that cells lacking rad <dig> continued to divide during re-replication, unlike wild-type cells or cells lacking cds <dig>  in both wild-type and checkpoint-mutant cells, regions near telomeres were particularly susceptible to re-replication. highly re-replicated telomere-proximal regions  were, in each case, followed by some of the least re-replicated dna in the genome.


CONCLUSIONS
the origins used, and the extent of replication fork progression, during re-replication are largely independent of the replication and dna-damage checkpoint pathways mediated by cds <dig> and rad <dig>  the fission yeast pattern of telomere-proximal amplification adjacent to a region of under-replication has also been seen in the distantly-related budding yeast, which suggests that subtelomeric sequences may be a promising place to look for dna re-replication in other organisms.
