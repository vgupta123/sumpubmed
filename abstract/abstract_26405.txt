BACKGROUND
integrating qtl results from independent experiments performed on related species helps to survey the genetic diversity of loci/alleles underlying complex traits, and to highlight potential targets for breeding or qtl cloning. potato  late blight resistance has been thoroughly studied, generating mapping data for many rpi-genes  and qtls . moreover, late blight resistance was often associated with plant maturity. to get insight into the genomic organization of late blight resistance loci as compared to maturity qtls, a qtl meta-analysis was performed for both traits.


RESULTS
nineteen qtl publications for late blight resistance were considered, seven of them reported maturity qtls. twenty-one qtl maps and eight reference maps were compiled to construct a  <dig> -marker consensus map on which qtls were projected and clustered into meta-qtls. the whole-genome qtl meta-analysis reduced by six-fold late blight resistance qtls , by ca. five-fold maturity qtls , and by ca. two-fold qtl confidence interval mean. late blight resistance meta-qtls were observed on every chromosome and maturity meta-qtls on only six chromosomes.


CONCLUSIONS
meta-analysis helped to refine the genomic regions of interest frequently described, and provided the closest flanking markers. meta-qtls of late blight resistance and maturity juxtaposed along chromosomes iv, v and viii, and overlapped on chromosomes vi and xi. the distribution of late blight resistance meta-qtls is significantly independent from those of rpi-genes, resistance gene analogs and defence-related loci. the anchorage of meta-qtls to the potato genome sequence, recently publicly released, will especially improve the candidate gene selection to determine the genes underlying meta-qtls. all mapping data are available from the sol genomics network  database.
