BACKGROUND
a genetic predisposition for certain tumour types has been proven for some dog breeds. some studies have suggested that this may also be true for the golden retriever breed. the present study aimed to examine a possible existence of a tumour  predisposition in the dutch population of golden retrievers by evaluating annual estimated incidence rates compared to incidence rates from previous publications. a second aim was to evaluate whether incidences of various tumours differed as related to the diagnostic method chosen, being either cytology or histology.


RESULTS
tumours submitted to utrecht university during the period 1998– <dig> diagnosed either by means of cytology  or histology , were related to an average annual dutch kennel club population of  <dig>  golden retrievers.

combining individual tumours from both the cytological and the histopathological data-set resulted in an annual estimated incidence rate of  <dig>  for  <dig>  dog-years at risk regarding tumour development in general.

the most common cytological tumor diagnoses were ‘fat, possibly lipoma’ , mast cell tumour  and non-hodgkin lymphoma . the most commonly diagnosed tumours by histology were mast cell tumour , soft tissue sarcomas  and melanoma . both the cytological and histopathological data-sets, showed variation; in patient age distribution, age of onset and incidence of various tumours.


CONCLUSIONS
comparing our data with previous reports in non-breed-specified dog populations, the golden retriever breed shows an increased risk for the development of tumours in general, as well as an increased risk for the development of specific tumour types, including the group of soft tissue sarcomas. variations in age, location and incidence of various tumours were observed between the two data-sets, indicating a selection bias for diagnostic procedure.
