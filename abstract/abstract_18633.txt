BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite the availability of effective pneumococcal vaccines. understanding the molecular interactions between the bacterium and the host will contribute to the control and prevention of pneumococcal disease.


RESULTS
we used a combination of adherence assays, mutagenesis and functional genomics to identify novel factors involved in adherence. by contrasting these processes in two pneumococcal strains, tigr <dig> and g <dig>  we showed that adherence and invasion capacities vary markedly by strain. electron microscopy showed more adherent bacteria in association with membranous pseudopodia in the tigr <dig> strain. operons for cell wall phosphorylcholine incorporation , manganese transport  and phosphate utilization  were up-regulated in both strains on exposure to epithelial cells. pneumolysin, pili, stress protection genes  and genes of the type ii fatty acid synthesis pathway were highly expressed in the naturally more invasive strain, tigr <dig>  deletion mutagenesis of five gene regions identified as regulated in this study revealed attenuation in adherence. most strikingly, âˆ†sp_ <dig> which was predicted to contain a b-cell epitope and revealed significant attenuation in adherence, appeared to be expressed as a part of an operon that includes the gene encoding the cytoplasmic pore-forming toxin and vaccine candidate, pneumolysin.


CONCLUSIONS
this work identifies a list of novel potential pneumococcal adherence determinants.
