BACKGROUND
vibrio carchariae chitinase a  is a family- <dig> glycosyl hydrolase and comprises three distinct structural domains: i) the amino terminal chitin binding domain ; ii) the  <dig> tim barrel catalytic domain ; and iii) the α + β insertion domain. the predicted tertiary structure of v. carchariae chitinase a has located the residues ser <dig> & trp <dig> at the end of chbd and trp <dig> & tyr <dig> at the exterior of the catalytic cleft. these residues are surface-exposed and presumably play an important role in chitin hydrolysis.


RESULTS
point mutations of the target residues of v. carchariae chitinase a were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. with respect to their binding activity towards crystalline α-chitin and colloidal chitin, chitin binding assays demonstrated a considerable decrease for mutants w70a and y245w, and a notable increase for s33w and w231a. when the specific hydrolyzing activity was determined, mutant w231a displayed reduced hydrolytic activity, whilst y245w showed enhanced activity. this suggested that an alteration in the hydrolytic activity was not correlated with a change in the ability of the enzyme to bind to chitin polymer. a mutation of trp <dig> to ala caused the most severe loss in both the binding and hydrolytic activities, which suggested that it is essential for crystalline chitin binding and hydrolysis. mutations varied neither the specific hydrolyzing activity against pnp- <dig>  nor the catalytic efficiency against chitohexaose, implying that the mutated residues are not important in oligosaccharide hydrolysis.


CONCLUSIONS
our data provide direct evidence that the binding as well as hydrolytic activities of v. carchariae chitinase a to insoluble chitin are greatly influenced by trp <dig> and less influenced by ser <dig>  though trp <dig> and tyr <dig> are involved in chitin hydrolysis, they do not play a major role in the binding process of crystalline chitin and the guidance of the chitin chain into the substrate binding cleft of the enzyme.
