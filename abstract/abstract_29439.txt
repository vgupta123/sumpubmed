BACKGROUND
agomelatine is a melatonergic receptor agonist and a 5ht2c receptor antagonist that has shown antidepressant efficacy. in order to analyze separately the effect of the two receptorial components, rats were chronically treated with agomelatine, melatonin , or s <dig> , and then subjected to acute footshock-stress.


RESULTS
only chronic agomelatine, but not melatonin or s <dig>  completely prevented the stress-induced increase of glutamate release in the rat prefrontal/frontal cortex.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest a potential synergy between melatonergic and serotonergic pathways in the action of agomelatine.
