BACKGROUND
argonaute, the core component of the rna induced silencing complex , binds to mature mirnas and regulates gene expression at transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. we recently reported that argonaute  <dig>  also assembles into complexes with mirna precursors . these ago2:pre-mirna complexes are catalytically active in vitro and constitute non-canonical riscs.


RESULTS
the use of pre-mirnas as guides by ago <dig> bypasses dicer activity and complicates in vitro risc reconstitution. in this work, we characterized ago2:pre-mirna complexes and identified rnas that are targeted by mirnas but not their corresponding pre-mirnas. using these target rnas we were able to recapitulate in vitro pre-mirna processing and canonical risc loading, and define the minimal factors required for these processes.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that ago <dig> and dicer are sufficient for processing and loading of mirnas into risc. furthermore, our studies suggest that ago <dig> binds primarily to the 5'- and alternatively, to the 3'-end of select pre-mirnas.
