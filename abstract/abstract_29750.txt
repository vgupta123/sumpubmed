BACKGROUND
the recently discovered adult neural stem cells, which maintain continuous generation of new neuronal and glial cells throughout adulthood, are a promising and expandable source of cells for use in cell replacement therapies within the central nervous system. these cells could either be induced to proliferate and differentiate endogenously, or expanded and differentiated in culture before being transplanted into the damaged site of the brain. in order to achieve these goals effective strategies to isolate, expand and differentiate neural stem cells into the desired specific phenotypes must be developed. however, little is known as yet about the factors and mechanisms influencing these processes. it has recently been reported that pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide  promotes neural stem cell proliferation both in vivo and in vitro.


RESULTS
we used cdna microarrays with the aim of analysing the transcriptional changes underlying pacap induced proliferation of neural stem cells. the primary neural stem/progenitor cells used were neurospheres, generated from the lateral ventricle wall of the adult mouse brain. the results were compared to both differentiation and proliferation controls, which revealed an unexpected and significant differential expression relating to withdrawal of epidermal growth factor  from the neurosphere growth medium. the effect of egf removal was so pronounced that it masked the changes in gene expression patterns produced by the addition of pacap.


CONCLUSIONS
experimental models aiming at transcriptional analysis of induced proliferation in primary neural stem cells need to take into consideration the significant effect on transcription caused by removal of egf. alternatively, egf-free culture conditions need to be developed.
