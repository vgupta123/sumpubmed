BACKGROUND
boron -deficiency is a widespread problem in many crops, including citrus. micrornas  play important roles in nutrient deficiencies. however, little is known on b-deficiency-responsive mirnas in plants. in this study, we first identified mirnas and their expression pattern in b-deficient citrus sinensis roots by illumina sequencing in order to identify mirnas that might be involved in the tolerance of plants to b-deficiency.


RESULTS
we isolated  <dig>  up-regulated and  <dig>  down-regulated mirnas from b-deficient roots, demonstrating remarkable metabolic flexibility of roots, which might contribute to the tolerance of plants to b-deficiency. a model for the possible roles of mirnas in the tolerance of roots to b-deficiency was proposed. mirnas might regulate the adaptations of roots to b-deficiency through following several aspects:  inactivating reactive oxygen species  signaling and scavenging through up-regulating mir <dig> and down-regulating mir <dig> and mir843;  increasing lateral root number by lowering mir <dig> expression and maintaining a certain phenotype favorable for b-deficiency-tolerance by increasing mir <dig> expression;  enhancing cell transport by decreasing the transcripts of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir3465;  improving osmoprotection  and regulating other metabolic reactions . other mirnas such as mir <dig> and mir <dig> in roots increased in response to b-deficiency, thus decreasing the expression of their target genes, which are involved in disease resistance, and hence, the disease resistance of roots.


CONCLUSIONS
our work demonstrates the possible roles of mirnas and related mechanisms in the response of plant roots to b-deficiency.
