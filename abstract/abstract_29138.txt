BACKGROUND
the structural classification of proteins  database uses a large number of hidden markov models  to represent families and superfamilies composed of proteins that presumably share the same evolutionary origin. however, how the hmms are related to one another has not been examined before.


RESULTS
in this work, taking into account the processes used to build the hmms, we propose a working hypothesis to examine the relationships between hmms and the families and superfamilies that they represent. specifically, we perform an all-against-all hmm comparison using the hhsearch program  and construct a network where the nodes are hmms and the edges connect similar hmms. we hypothesize that the hmms in a connected component belong to the same family or superfamily more often than expected under a random network connection model. results show a pattern consistent with this working hypothesis. moreover, the hmm network possesses features distinctly different from the previously documented biological networks, exemplified by the exceptionally high clustering coefficient and the large number of connected components.


CONCLUSIONS
the current finding may provide guidance in devising computational methods to reduce the degree of overlaps between the hmms representing the same superfamilies, which may in turn enable more efficient large-scale sequence searches against the database of hmms.
