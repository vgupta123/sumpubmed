BACKGROUND
the physical periphery of a biological cell is mainly described by signaling pathways which are triggered by transmembrane proteins and receptors that are sentinels to control the whole gene regulatory network of a cell. however, our current knowledge about the gene regulatory mechanisms that are governed by extracellular signals is severely limited.


RESULTS
the purpose of this paper is three fold. first, we infer a gene regulatory network from a large-scale b-cell lymphoma expression data set using the c3net algorithm. second, we provide a functional and structural analysis of the largest connected component of this network, revealing that this network component corresponds to the peripheral region of a cell. third, we analyze the hierarchical organization of network components of the whole inferred b-cell gene regulatory network by introducing a new approach which exploits the variability within the data as well as the inferential characteristics of c3net. as a result, we find a functional bisection of the network corresponding to different cellular components.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, our study allows to highlight the peripheral gene regulatory network of b-cells and shows that it is centered around hub transmembrane proteins located at the physical periphery of the cell. in addition, we identify a variety of novel pathological transmembrane proteins such as ion channel complexes and signaling receptors in b-cell lymphoma.
