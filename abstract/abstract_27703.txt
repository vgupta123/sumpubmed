BACKGROUND
eukaryotic replication origins exhibit different initiation efficiencies and activation times within s-phase. although local chromatin structure and function influences origin activity, the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. a key to understanding the exact features of chromatin that impinge on replication origin function is to define the precise locations of the dna sequences that control origin function. in s. cerevisiae, autonomously replicating sequences  contain a consensus sequence  that binds the origin recognition complex  and is essential for origin function. however, an acs is not sufficient for origin function and the majority of acs matches do not function as orc binding sites, complicating the specific identification of these sites.


RESULTS
to identify essential origin sequences genome-wide, we utilized a tiled oligonucleotide array  to map the orc and mcm2p binding sites at high resolution. these binding sites define a set of potential autonomously replicating sequences , which we term nimarss. the nimars set comprises  <dig> orc and/or mcm2p binding sites, which includes 95% of known arss, and experimental verification demonstrates that 94% are functional. the resolution of the analysis facilitated identification of potential acss  within  <dig> nimarss. cross-validation shows that the nimacs predictions include 58% of known acss, and experimental verification indicates that 82% are essential for ars activity.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings provide the most comprehensive, accurate, and detailed mapping of orc binding sites to date, adding to the emerging picture of the chromatin organization of the budding yeast genome.
