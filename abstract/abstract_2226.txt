BACKGROUND
cucumber, cucumis sativus l., is an economically important vegetable crop which is processed or consumed fresh worldwide. however, the narrow genetic base in cucumber makes it difficult for constructing high-density genetic maps. the development of massively parallel genotyping methods and next-generation sequencing  technologies provides an excellent opportunity for developing single nucleotide polymorphisms  for linkage map construction and qtl analysis of horticultural traits. specific-length amplified fragment sequencing  is a recent marker development technology that allows large-scale snp discovery and genotyping at a reasonable cost. in this study, we constructed a high-density snp map for cucumber using slaf-seq and detected fruit-related qtls.


RESULTS
an f <dig> population of  <dig> individuals was developed from an intra-varietal cross between cc <dig> and nc <dig>  genomic dnas extracted from two parents and 148 f <dig> individuals were subjected to high-throughput sequencing and slaf library construction. a total of  <dig>  gb raw data and  <dig> , <dig> pair-end reads were generated to develop  <dig>  high-quality slafs, out of which  <dig>  were polymorphic.  <dig>  slafs were encoded and grouped into different segregation patterns. a high-resolution genetic map containing  <dig>  snps was constructed for cucumber spanning  <dig>  cm. the average distance between adjacent markers was  <dig>  cm.  <dig> scaffolds were anchored to the snp-based genetic map covering 46%  of the cucumber genome . nine qtls for fruit length and weight were detected, a qtl designated fl <dig>  explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. alignment of the snp markers to draft genome scaffolds revealed two mis-assembled scaffolds that were validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization .


CONCLUSIONS
we report herein the development of evenly dispersed snps across cucumber genome, and for the first time an snp-based saturated linkage map. this  <dig> -locus map would likely facilitate genetic mapping of complex qtl loci controlling fruit yield, and the orientation of draft genome scaffolds.
