BACKGROUND
pathway analysis based on genome-wide association studies  data has become popular as a secondary analysis strategy. although many pathway analysis tools have been developed for caseâ€“control studies, there is no tool that can use all information from raw genotypes in general nuclear families. we developed pathway-pdt, which uses the framework of pedigree disequilibrium test  for general family data, to perform pathway analysis based on raw genotypes in family-based gwas.


RESULTS
simulation results showed that pathway-pdt is more powerful than the p-value based method, aligator. pathway-pdt also can be more powerful than the plink set-based test when analyzing general nuclear families with multiple siblings or missing parents. additionally, pathway-pdt has a flexible and convenient user interface, which allows users to modify their analysis parameters as well as to apply various types of gene and pathway definitions.


CONCLUSIONS
the pathway-pdt method is implemented in c++ with posix threads and is computationally feasible for pathway analysis with large scale family gwas datasets. the windows binary along with makefile and source codes for the linux are available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/pathway-pdt/.
