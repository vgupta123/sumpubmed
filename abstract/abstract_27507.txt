BACKGROUND
adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell  therapy in regenerative medicine is a rapidly growing area of research and is currently also being used to treat osteoarthritis . force platform analysis has been consistently used to verify the efficacy of different therapeutic strategies for the treatment of oa in dogs, but never with ad-msc.

the aim of this study was to use a force platform to measure the efficacy of intraarticular admsc administration for limb function improvement in dogs with severe oa.


RESULTS
eight lame dogs with severe hip oa and a control group of  <dig> sound dogs were used for this study. results were statistically analyzed to detect a significant increase in peak vertical force  and vertical impulse  in treated dogs. mean values of pvf and vi were significantly improved after treatment of the oa groups, reaching  <dig> % and  <dig> % of body weight, respectively, at day  <dig>  compared with only  <dig> % and  <dig> % at day  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this study objectively demonstrated that intraarticular admsc therapy resulted in reduced lameness due to oa.
