BACKGROUND
schizochytrium limacinum sr <dig> is a potential industrial strain for docosahexaenoic acid  production that contains more than 30– <dig> % dha among its total fatty acids.

methods
to resolve the dha biosynthesis mechanism and improve dha production at a systematic level, a genomescale metabolic model , named icy1170_dha, which contains  <dig> reactions,  <dig> metabolites, and  <dig> genes, was reconstructed.


RESULTS
based on genome annotation results and literature reports, a new dha synthesis pathway based on a polyketide synthase  system was detected in s. limacinum. similarly to conventional fatty acid synthesis, the biosynthesis of dha via pks requires abundant acetyl-coa and nadph. the in silico addition of malate and citrate led to increases of  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % in dha production, respectively. moreover, based on the results predicted by the model, six amino acids were shown to improve dha production by experiment. finally,  <dig> genes were identified as potential targets for dha over-production using a minimization of metabolic adjustment algorithm.


CONCLUSIONS
the reconstructed gsmm, icy1170_dha, could be used to elucidate the mechanism by which dha is synthesized in s. limacinum and predict the requirements of abundant acetyl-coa and nadph for dha production as well as the enhanced yields achieved via supplementation with six amino acids, malate, and citrate.
