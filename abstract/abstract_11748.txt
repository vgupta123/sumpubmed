BACKGROUND
the transcription factor nf-kappab is a very interesting target molecule for the design on anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic drugs. however, the application of the widely-used molecular docking computational method for the virtual screening of chemical libraries on nf-kappab is not yet reported in literature. docking studies on a dataset of  <dig> molecules from extracts of two different medicinal plants to nf-kappab-p <dig> were performed with the purpose of developing a docking protocol fit for the target under study.


RESULTS
we enhanced the simple docking procedure by means of a sort of combined target- and ligand-based drug design approach. advantages of this combination strategy, based on a similarity parameter for the identification of weak binding chemical entities, are illustrated in this work with the discovery of a new lead compound for nf-kappab. further biochemical analyses based on emsa were performed and biological effects were tested on the compound exhibiting the best docking score. all experimental analysis were in fairly good agreement with molecular modeling findings.


CONCLUSIONS
the results obtained sustain the concept that the docking performance is predictive of a biochemical activity. in this respect, this paper represents the first example of successfully individuation through molecular docking simulations of a promising lead compound for the inhibition of nf-kappab-p <dig> biological activity and modulation of the expression of the nf-kb regulated il <dig> gene.
