BACKGROUND
aromatic rice is popular worldwide because of its characteristic fragrance. genetic studies and physical fine mapping reveal that a candidate gene  homologous to betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase is responsible for aroma metabolism in fragrant rice varieties, but the direct evidence demonstrating the functions of osbadh <dig> is lacking. to elucidate the physiological roles of osbadh <dig>  sequencing approach and rna interference  technique were employed to analyze allelic variation and functions of osbadh <dig> gene in aroma production. semi-quantitative, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction , as well as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry  were conducted to determine the expression levels of osbadh <dig> and the fragrant compound in wild type and transgenic osbadh2-rnai repression lines, respectively.


RESULTS
the results showed that multiple mutations identical to fgr allele occur in the  <dig> fragrant rice accessions across china; osbadh <dig> is expressed constitutively, with less expression abundance in mature roots; the disrupted osbadh <dig> by rna interference leads to significantly increased 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline production.


CONCLUSIONS
we have found that the altered expression levels of osbadh <dig> gene influence aroma accumulation, and the prevalent aromatic allele probably has a single evolutionary origin.
