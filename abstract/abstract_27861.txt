BACKGROUND
rice xa3/xa <dig> disease-resistance gene encodes a leucine-rich repeat  receptor kinase-type protein against xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae  and belongs to a multigene family. however, the functions of most genes in this family are unknown.


RESULTS
here we report that two orthologs of this family, the nrke from rice variety nipponbare and 9rke from variety 93- <dig> at the rke locus, have similar functions although they encode different proteins. this pair of orthologs could not mediate resistance to xoo, but they were transcriptionally induced by raised temperature. transcriptional activation of nrke or 9rke resulted in the formation of temperature-sensitive lesion mimics, which were spots of dead cells associated with accumulation of superoxides, in different organs of the transgenic plants. these plants were more sensitive to high temperature shock than wild-type controls. transgenic plants carrying a chimeric protein consisting of the lrr domain of nrke and the kinase domain of xa3/xa <dig> developed the same lesion mimics as the nrke-transgenic plants, whereas transgenic plants carrying another chimeric protein consisting of the lrr domain of xa3/xa <dig> and the kinase domain of nrke were free of lesion mimic. all the transgenic plants carrying a chimeric protein were susceptible to xoo.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that the rke locus is involved in rice response to raised temperature. the lrr domain of rke protein appears to be important to sense increased temperature. the rke-involved temperature-related pathway and xa3/xa26-mediated disease-resistance pathway may partially overlap.
