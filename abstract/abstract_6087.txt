BACKGROUND
the number of gene sequences that are available for comparative genomics approaches is increasing extremely quickly. a current challenge is to be able to handle this huge amount of sequences in order to build families of homologous sequences in a reasonable time.


RESULTS
we present the software package silix that implements a novel method which reconsiders single linkage clustering with a graph theoretical approach. a parallel version of the algorithms is also presented. as a demonstration of the ability of our software, we clustered more than  <dig> millions sequences from about  <dig> billion blast hits in  <dig> minutes, with a high clustering quality, both in terms of sensitivity and specificity.


CONCLUSIONS
comparing state-of-the-art software, silix presents the best up-to-date capabilities to face the problem of clustering large collections of sequences. silix is freely available at http://lbbe.univ-lyon <dig> fr/silix.
