BACKGROUND
the rho-kinases  are major effector targets of the activated rho gtpase that have been implicated in many of the rho-mediated effects on cell shape and movement via their ability to affect acto-myosin contractility. the role of rocks in cell shape change and motility suggests a potentially important role for rho-rock signaling in tissue morphogenesis during development. indeed, in drosophila, a single rock ortholog, drok, has been identified and has been found to be required for establishing planar cell polarity.


RESULTS
we have examined a potential role for drok in additional aspects of tissue morphogenesis using an activated form of the protein in transgenic flies. our findings demonstrate that drok activity can influence multiple morphogenetic processes, including eye and wing development. furthermore, genetic studies reveal that drok interacts with multiple downstream effectors of the rho gtpase signaling pathway, including non-muscle myosin heavy chain, adducin, and diaphanous in those developmental processes. finally, in overexpression studies, we determined that drok and drosophila lim-kinase interact in the developing nervous system.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings indicate widespread diverse roles for drok in tissue morphogenesis during drosophila development, in which multiple drok substrates appear to be required.
