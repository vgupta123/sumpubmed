BACKGROUND
the human sex hormone binding globulin  gene, located at 17p <dig> , comprises, at least, two different transcription units regulated by two different promoters. the first transcription unit begins with the exon  <dig> sequence and is responsible for the production of plasma shbg by the hepatocytes, while the second begins with an alternative exon  <dig> sequence, which replaces the exon  <dig> present in liver transcripts. alternative exon  <dig> transcription and translation has only been demonstrated in the testis of transgenic mice containing an 11-kb human shbg transgene and in the human testis. our goal has been to further characterize the 5' end of the shbg gene and analyze the presence of the shbg alternative transcripts in human prostate tissue and derived cell lines.


RESULTS
using a combination of in silico and in vitro studies, we have demonstrated that the shbg gene, along with exon  <dig> and alternative exon  <dig> , contains four additional alternative first exons: the novel exons 1b, 1c, and 1e, and a previously identified exon 1n, which has been further characterized and renamed as exon 1d. we have shown that these four alternative first exons are all spliced to the same 3' splice site of shbg exon  <dig>  and that exon 1a and the novel exon 1b can be spliced to exon  <dig>  we have also demonstrated the presence of shbg transcripts beginning with exons 1b, 1c and 1d in prostate tissues and cell lines, as well as in several non-prostatic cell lines. finally, the alignment of the shbg mammalian sequences revealed that, while exons 1c, 1d and 1e are very well conserved phylogenetically through non-primate mammal species, exon 1b probably aroused in apes due to a single nucleotide change that generated a new 5' splice site in exon 1b.


CONCLUSIONS
the identification of multiple transcription start sites  upstream of the annotated first exon of human shbg, and the detection of the alternative transcripts in human prostate, concur with the prediction of the encode  project, and suggest that the regulation of shbg is much more complex than previously reported.
