BACKGROUND
labdane-related diterpenoids form the largest group among the diterpenes. they fulfill important functions in primary metabolism as essential plant growth hormones and are known to function in secondary metabolism as, for example, phytoalexins. the biosynthesis of labdane-related diterpenes is mediated by the action of class ii and class i diterpene synthases. although terpene synthases have been well investigated in poplar, little is known about diterpene formation in this woody perennial plant species.


RESULTS
the recently sequenced genome of populus trichocarpa possesses two putative copalyl diphosphate synthase genes  and two putative kaurene synthase genes , which most likely arose through a genome duplication and a recent tandem gene duplication, respectively. we showed that the cps-like gene pttps <dig> encodes an ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase , while the protein encoded by the putative cps gene pttps <dig> showed no enzymatic activity. the putative kaurene synthases pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> both accepted ent-copalyl diphosphate  as substrate. however, despite their high sequence similarity, they produced different diterpene products. while pttps <dig> formed exclusively ent-kaurene, pttps <dig> generated mainly the diterpene alcohol, 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane. using homology-based structure modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that one amino acid residue determines the different product specificity of pttps <dig> and pttps <dig>  a reciprocal exchange of methionine  <dig> and threonine  <dig> in the active sites of pttps <dig> and pttps <dig>  respectively, led to a complete interconversion of the enzyme product profiles. gene expression analysis revealed that the diterpene synthase genes characterized showed organ-specific expression with the highest abundance of pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> transcripts in poplar roots.


CONCLUSIONS
the poplar diterpene synthases pttps <dig>  pttps <dig>  and pttps <dig> contribute to the production of ent-kaurene and 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane in poplar. while ent-kaurene most likely serves as the universal precursor for gibberellins, the function of 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane in poplar is not known yet. however, the high expression levels of pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> in poplar roots may indicate an important function of 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane in secondary metabolism in this plant organ.
