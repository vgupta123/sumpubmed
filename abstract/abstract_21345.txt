BACKGROUND
the fagaceae family comprises about  <dig>  woody species worldwide. about half belong to the quercus family. these oaks are often a source of raw material for biomass wood and fiber. pedunculate and sessile oaks, are among the most important deciduous forest tree species in europe. despite their ecological and economical importance, very few genomic resources have yet been generated for these species. here, we describe the development of an est catalogue that will support ecosystem genomics studies, where geneticists, ecophysiologists, molecular biologists and ecologists join their efforts for understanding, monitoring and predicting functional genetic diversity.


RESULTS
we generated  <dig>  sequence reads from  <dig> cdna libraries using the sanger method. unexploitable chromatograms and quality checking lead us to eliminate  <dig>  sequences. finally a total of  <dig>  ests were retained from  <dig>  cdna clones. pyrosequencing was also conducted for  <dig> libraries, generating  <dig> , <dig> reads, from which  <dig>  sequences  were eliminated, resulting in  <dig> , <dig> sequences. following clustering and assembly using tgicl pipeline,  <dig> , <dig> est sequences collapsed into  <dig>  tentative contigs and  <dig>  singletons, providing  <dig>  non-redundant sequences . we also assembled the sequences using mira and partigene software and compared the three unigene sets. gene ontology annotation was then assigned to  <dig>  unigene elements. blast search against the swiss-prot database revealed putative homologs for  <dig>   unigene elements, but more extensive search with pfam, refseq_protein, refseq_rna and eight gene indices revealed homology for  <dig> % of them. the est catalogue was examined for putative homologs of candidate genes involved in bud phenology, cuticle formation, phenylpropanoids biosynthesis and cell wall formation. our results suggest a good coverage of genes involved in these traits. comparative orthologous sequences  with other plant gene models were identified and allow to unravel the oak paleo-history. simple sequence repeats  and single nucleotide polymorphisms  were searched, resulting in  <dig>  ssrs and  <dig>  snps. all of these are available through the oak contig browser http://genotoul-contigbrowser.toulouse.inra.fr:9092/quercus_robur/index.html.


CONCLUSIONS
this genomic resource provides a unique tool to discover genes of interest, study the oak transcriptome, and develop new markers to investigate functional diversity in natural populations.
