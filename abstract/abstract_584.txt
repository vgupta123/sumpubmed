BACKGROUND
var genes encode a family of virulence factors known as pfemp <dig>  which are responsible for both antigenic variation and cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes. although these molecules play a central role in malaria pathogenesis, the mechanisms generating variant antigen diversification are poorly understood. to investigate var gene evolution, we compared the variant antigen repertoires from three geographically diverse parasite isolates: the 3d <dig> genome reference isolate; the recently sequenced hb <dig> isolate; and the it4/25/ <dig>  parasite isolate which retains the capacity to cytoadhere in vitro and in vivo.


RESULTS
these comparisons revealed that only two var genes  are conserved in all three isolates and one var gene  has homologs in it <dig> and 3d <dig>  while the remaining  <dig> plus genes in each isolate are highly divergent most can be classified into the three previously defined major groups  on the basis of 5' flanking sequence and chromosome location. repertoire-wide sequence comparisons suggest that the conserved homologs are evolving separately from other var genes and that genes in group a have diverged from other groups.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings support the existence of a var gene recombination hierarchy that restricts recombination possibilities and has a central role in the functional and immunological adaptation of var genes.
