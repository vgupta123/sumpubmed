BACKGROUND
extended-spectrum Î²-lactamases , particularly ctx-m- type esbls, are among the most important resistance determinants spreading worldwide in enterobacteriaceae. the aim of this study was to characterize a collection of  <dig> esbl-producing escherichia coli collected in tunisia, their esbl-encoding plasmids and plasmid associated addiction systems.


RESULTS
the collection comprised  <dig> esbl producers collected from two university hospitals of sfax between  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> isolates harbored blactx-m gene .  <dig> isolates carried blashv- <dig> gene,  <dig> blashv-2a gene and only  <dig> blatem- <dig> gene.  <dig> isolates produced both ctx-m and shv- <dig>  the  <dig> ctx-m-15-producing isolates were significantly associated to phylogroup b <dig> and exhibiting a high number of virulence factors.  <dig>  of the group b <dig> isolates belonged to clonal complex st <dig>  pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  typing revealed a genetic diversity of the isolates.  <dig> esbl determinants were transferable mostly by conjugation. the majority of plasmid carrying blactx-m- <dig> genes  were assigned to various single replicon or multireplicon incf types and had significantly a higher frequency of addiction systems, notably the vagcd module.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that the dissemination of ctx-m- <dig> producing e. coli in our setting was due to the spread of various incf-type plasmids harboring multiple addiction systems, into related clones with high frequency of virulence determinants.
