BACKGROUND
ontology-based gene annotations are important tools for organizing and analyzing genome-scale biological data. collecting these annotations is a valuable but costly endeavor. the gene wiki makes use of wikipedia as a low-cost, mass-collaborative platform for assembling text-based gene annotations. the gene wiki is comprised of more than  <dig>  review articles, each describing one human gene. the goal of this study is to define and assess a computational strategy for translating the text of gene wiki articles into ontology-based gene annotations. we specifically explore the generation of structured annotations using the gene ontology and the human disease ontology.


RESULTS
our system produced  <dig>  candidate gene annotations using the disease ontology and  <dig>  candidate annotations using the gene ontology from the text of the gene wiki. based on manual evaluations and comparisons to reference annotation sets, we estimate a precision of 90-93% for the disease ontology annotations and 48-64% for the gene ontology annotations. we further demonstrate that this data set can systematically improve the results from gene set enrichment analyses.


CONCLUSIONS
the gene wiki is a rapidly growing corpus of text focused on human gene function. here, we demonstrate that the gene wiki can be a powerful resource for generating ontology-based gene annotations. these annotations can be used immediately to improve workflows for building curated gene annotation databases and knowledge-based statistical analyses.
