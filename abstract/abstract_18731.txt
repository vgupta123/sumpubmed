BACKGROUND
chondromodulin-i  is an anti-angiogenic glycoprotein that is specifically localized at the extracellular matrix of the avascular mesenchyme including cartilage and cardiac valves. in this study, we characterized the expression pattern of chm-i during early pregnancy in mice in vivo and its effect on invasion of trophoblastic cells into matrigel in vitro.


RESULTS
northern blot analysis clearly indicated that chm-i transcripts were expressed in the pregnant mouse uterus at  <dig> - <dig>  days post coitum. in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed that chm-i was localized to the mature decidua surrounding the matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> -expressing trophoblasts. consistent with this observation, the expression of chm-i mrna was induced in decidualizing endometrial stromal cells in vitro, in response to estradiol and progesterone. recombinant human chm-i  markedly inhibited the invasion through matrigel as well as the chemotactic migration of rat rcho- <dig> trophoblast cells in a manner independent of mmp activation.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates the inhibitory action of chm-i on trophoblast migration and invasion, implying the potential role of the chm-i expression in decidual cells for the regulated tissue remodeling and angiogenesis at feto-maternal interface.
