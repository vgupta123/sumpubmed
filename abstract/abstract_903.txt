BACKGROUND
immunization with recombinant carboxyl-terminal domain of the heavy chain  of botulinum neurotoxin  stimulates protective immunity against native bont challenge. most studies developing a botulism vaccine have focused on the whole hc; however, since the principal protective epitopes are located within β-trefoil domain , we hypothesize that immunization with the hcβtre domain is sufficient to confer protective immunity. in addition, enhancing its uptake subsequent to nasal delivery prompted development of an alternative vaccine strategy, and we hypothesize that the addition of targeting moiety adenovirus  <dig> fiber protein  may enhance such uptake during vaccination.


RESULTS
the hcβtre serotype b immunogen was genetically fused to ad2f , and its immunogenicity was tested in mice. in combination with the mucosal adjuvant, cholera toxin , enhanced mucosal iga and serum igg ab titers were induced by nasal hcβtre-ad2f relative to hcβtre alone; however, similar ab titers were obtained upon intramuscular immunization. these bont/b-specific abs induced by nasal immunization were generally supported in large part by th <dig> cells, as opposed to hcβtre-immunized mice that showed more mixed th <dig> and th <dig> cells. using a mouse neutralization assay, sera from animals immunized with hcβtre and hcβtre-ad2f protected mice against  <dig>  ld <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate that hcβtre-based immunogens are highly immunogenic, especially when genetically fused to ad2f, and ad2f can be exploited as a vaccine delivery platform to the mucosa.
