BACKGROUND
tuberculosis is the leading cause of death due to bacterial infections worldwide, mainly caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis. the antigen  <dig> complex comprises a set of major secreted proteins of m. tuberculosis, which are potential biomarkers for diagnostic.


RESULTS
in this work, the first human single chain fragment variable  antibodies specific for the tuberculosis biomarker  <dig> b were selected by phage display from na√Øve antibody gene libraries . produced as scfv-fc in mammalian cells, these antibodies were further characterized and analysed for specificity and applicability in different tuberculosis antigen detection assays. sandwich detection of recombinant  <dig> b was successful in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay , lateral flow immunoassay and immunoblot. whereas detection of m. tuberculosis cell extracts and culture filtrates was only possible in direct elisa and immunoblot assays. it was found that the conformation of  <dig> b, depending on sample treatment, influenced antigen detection.


CONCLUSIONS
recombinant antibodies, selected by phage display, may be applicable for  <dig> b detection in various assays. these antibodies are candidates for the development of future point of care tuberculosis diagnostic kits. using  <dig> b as a biomarker, the antigen conformation influenced by sample treatment is important.
