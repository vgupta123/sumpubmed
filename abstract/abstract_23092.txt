BACKGROUND
bread wheat  has a large, complex and hexaploid genome consisting of a, b and d homoeologous chromosome sets. therefore each wheat gene potentially exists as a trio of a, b and d homoeoloci, each of which may contribute differentially to wheat phenotypes. we describe a novel approach combining wheat cytogenetic resources  with next generation deep sequencing of gene transcripts , to directly and accurately identify homoeologue-specific single nucleotide variants and quantify the relative contribution of individual homoeoloci to gene expression.


RESULTS
we discover, based on a sample comprising ~5-10% of the total wheat gene content, that at least 45% of wheat genes are expressed from all three distinct homoeoloci. most of these genes show strikingly biased expression patterns in which expression is dominated by a single homoeolocus. the remaining ~55% of wheat genes are expressed from either one or two homoeoloci only, through a combination of extensive transcriptional silencing and homoeolocus loss.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that wheat is tending towards functional diploidy, through a variety of mechanisms causing single homoeoloci to become the predominant source of gene transcripts. this discovery has profound consequences for wheat breeding and our understanding of wheat evolution.
