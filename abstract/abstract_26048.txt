BACKGROUND
cellular senescence can be induced by a variety of extrinsic stimuli, and sustained exposure to sunlight is a key factor in photoaging of the skin. accordingly, irradiation of skin fibroblasts by uvb light triggers cellular senescence, which is thought to contribute to extrinsic skin aging, although molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. here, we addressed molecular mechanisms underlying uvb induced senescence of human diploid fibroblasts.


RESULTS
we observed a parallel activation of the p53/p21waf <dig> and p16ink4a/prb pathways. using genome-wide transcriptome analysis, we identified a transcriptional signature of uvb-induced senescence that was conserved in three independent strains of human diploid fibroblasts  from skin. in parallel, a comprehensive screen for micrornas regulated during uvb-induced senescence was performed which identified five micrornas that are significantly regulated during the process. bioinformatic analysis of mirna-mrna networks was performed to identify new functional mrna targets with high confidence for mir-15a, mir-20a, mir-20b, mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  already known targets of these mirnas were identified in each case, validating the approach. several new targets were identified for all of these mirnas, with the potential to provide new insight in the process of uvb-induced senescence at a genome-wide level. subsequent analysis was focused on mir- <dig> and its putative target gene ezh <dig>  we confirmed that ezh <dig> is regulated by mir- <dig> in human fibroblasts, and found that both overexpression of mir- <dig> and downregulation of ezh <dig> independently induce senescence in the absence of uvb irradiation. however, the downregulation of mir- <dig> was not sufficient to block the phenotype of uvb-induced senescence, suggesting that other uvb-induced processes induce the senescence response in a pathway redundant with upregulation of mir- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we performed a comprehensive screen for uvb-regulated micrornas in human diploid fibroblasts, and identified a network of mirna-mrna interactions mediating uvb-induced senescence. in addition, mir- <dig> and ezh <dig> were identified as key players in uvb-induced senescence of hdf.
