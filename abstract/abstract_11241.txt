BACKGROUND
light and carbon are two important interacting signals affecting plant growth and development. the mechanism and/or genes involved in sensing and/or mediating the signaling pathways involving these interactions are unknown. this study integrates genetic, genomic and systems approaches to identify a genetically perturbed gene network that is regulated by the interaction of carbon and light signaling in arabidopsis.


RESULTS
carbon and light insensitive  mutants were isolated. microarray data from cli <dig> is analyzed to identify the genes, biological processes and gene networks affected by the integration of light and carbon pathways. analysis of this data reveals  <dig> genes regulated by light and/or carbon signaling in wild-type. in cli <dig>   <dig> of these light/carbon regulated genes are misregulated in response to light and/or carbon treatments where 78% are misregulated in response to light and carbon interactions. analysis of the gene lists show that genes in the biological processes "energy" and "metabolism" are over-represented among the  <dig> genes regulated by carbon and/or light in wild-type, and the  <dig> misregulated genes in cli <dig>  to understand connections among carbon and/or light regulated genes in wild-type and the misregulated genes in cli <dig>  the microarray data is interpreted in the context of metabolic and regulatory networks. the network created from the  <dig> light/carbon regulated genes in wild-type, reveals that cli <dig> is affected in the light and/or carbon regulation of a network of  <dig> connected genes, including six transcription factors. one transcription factor, hat <dig> appears to be a regulatory "hub" in the cli <dig> network as it shows regulatory connections linking a metabolic network of genes involved in "amino acid metabolism", "c-compound/carbohydrate metabolism" and "glycolysis/gluconeogenesis".


CONCLUSIONS
the global misregulation of gene networks controlled by light and carbon signaling in cli <dig> indicates that it represents one of the first arabidopsis mutants isolated that is specifically disrupted in the integration of both carbon and light signals to control the regulation of metabolic, developmental and regulatory genes. the network analysis of misregulated genes suggests that cli <dig> acts to integrate light and carbon signaling interactions and is a master regulator connecting the regulation of a host of downstream metabolic and regulatory processes.
