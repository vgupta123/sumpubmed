BACKGROUND
the mrp <dig> gene encodes the  <dig> kda multidrug resistance-associated protein  <dig>  and effluxes diverse drugs and xenobiotics. sequence variations within this gene might account for differences in drug response in different individuals. to facilitate association studies of this gene with diseases and/or drug response, exons and flanking introns of mrp <dig> were screened for polymorphisms in  <dig> dna samples from four different populations.


RESULTS
seventy-one polymorphisms, including  <dig> biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms , ten insertions/deletions  and one short tandem repeat  were identified. thirty-four of these polymorphisms have not been previously reported. interestingly, the str polymorphism at the 5' untranslated region  occurs at high but different frequencies in the different populations. frequencies of common polymorphisms in our populations were comparable to those of similar populations in hapmap or perlegen. nucleotide diversity indices indicated that the coding region of mrp <dig> may have undergone negative selection or recent population expansion. snps e10/ <dig> g>t  and e16/ <dig> g>t  which occur at low frequency in only one or two of four populations examined were predicted to be functionally deleterious and hence are likely to be under negative selection.


CONCLUSIONS
through in silico approaches, we identified two rare snps that are potentially negatively selected. these snps may be useful for studies associating this gene with rare events including adverse drug reactions.
