BACKGROUND
campylobacter jejuni is the most common bacterial cause of human gastroenteritis worldwide. due to the sporadic nature of infection, sources often remain unknown. multilocus sequence typing  has been successfully applied to population genetics of campylobacter jejuni and mathematical modelling can be applied to the sequence data. here, we analysed the population structure of a total of  <dig> finnish c. jejuni isolates from bovines, poultry meat and humans collected in  <dig> using a combination of bayesian clustering  and phylogenetic analysis.


RESULTS
in the first phase we analysed sequence types  of  <dig> finnish bovine c. jejuni isolates by mlst and found a high diversity totalling  <dig> sts of which nearly half were novel. in the second phase we included mlst data from domestic human isolates as well as poultry c. jejuni isolates from the same time period. between the human and bovine isolates we found an overlap of  <dig> %, while 69% of the human isolates were overlapping with the chicken isolates. in the baps analysis  <dig> % of the human isolates were found in bovine-associated baps clusters and  <dig> % of the human isolates were found in the poultry-associated baps cluster. baps reflected the phylogeny of our data very well.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that bovines and poultry were equally important as reservoirs for human c. jejuni infections in finland in  <dig>  our results differ from those obtained in other countries where poultry has been identified as the most important source for human infections. the low prevalence of c. jejuni in poultry flocks in finland could explain the lower attribution of human infection to poultry. of the human isolates  <dig> % were found in clusters not associated with any host which warrants further investigation, with particular focus on waterborne transmission routes and companion animals.
