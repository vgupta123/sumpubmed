BACKGROUND
abnormal immune function is often an underlying component of illness pathophysiology and symptom presentation. functional and phenotypic immune-related alterations may play a role in the obscure pathomechanism of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis . the objective of this study was to investigate the functional ability of innate and adaptive immune cells in moderate and severe cfs/me patients. the  <dig> fukuda criteria for cfs/me were used to define cfs/me patients. cfs/me participants were grouped based on illness severity with  <dig> moderately affected  and  <dig> severely affected  cfs/me patients who were age and sex matched with  <dig> healthy controls. flow cytometric protocols were used for immunological analysis of dendritic cells, monocytes and neutrophil function as well as measures of lytic proteins and t, natural killer  and b cell receptors.


RESULTS
cfs/me patients exhibited alterations in nk receptors and adhesion markers and receptors on cd4+t and cd8+t cells. moderate cfs/me patients had increased cd8+ cd45ra effector memory t cells, slam expression on nk cells, kir2dl5+ on cd4+t cells and btla4+ on cd4+t central memory cells. moderate cfs/me patients also had reduced cd8+t central memory lfa- <dig>  total cd8+t klrg <dig>  naïve cd4+t klrg <dig> and cd56dimcd16− nk cell cd2+ and cd18+cd2+. severe cfs/me patients had increased cd18+cd11c− in the cd56dimcd16− nk cell phenotype and reduced nkp <dig> in cd56brightcd16dim nk cells.


CONCLUSIONS
this research accentuated the presence of immunological abnormalities in cfs/me and highlighted the importance of assessing functional parameters of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the illness.
