BACKGROUND
biological pathways are a useful abstraction of biological concepts, and software tools to deal with pathway diagrams can help biological research. pathvisio is a new visualization tool for biological pathways that mimics the popular genmapp tool with a completely new java implementation that allows better integration with other open source projects. the genmapp mapp file format is replaced by gpml, a new xml file format that provides seamless exchange of graphical pathway information among multiple programs.


RESULTS
pathvisio can be combined with other bioinformatics tools to open up three possible uses: visual compilation of biological knowledge, interpretation of high-throughput expression datasets, and computational augmentation of pathways with interaction information. pathvisio is open source software and available at .


CONCLUSIONS
pathvisio is a graphical editor for biological pathways, with flexibility and ease of use as primary goals.
