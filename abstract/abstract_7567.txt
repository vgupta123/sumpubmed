BACKGROUND
radio-adaptive response  is a biological defense mechanism whereby exposure to low dose ionizing radiation  mitigates the detrimental effects of high dose irradiation. rar has been widely observed in vivo using as endpoint less induction of apoptosis. however, sex differences associated with rar and variations between males and females on global gene expression influenced by rar have not been still investigated. in addition, the response to radiation-induced apoptosis is associated with phosphorylation of trp <dig> at both the serine  <dig>  and serine  <dig>  residues, but the role of these two phosphorylated forms in male and female rar remains to be elucidated.


RESULTS
we analyzed the effect of administering priming low dose radiation  prior to high dose radiation  on the level of caspase-3-mediated apoptosis and on global transcriptional expression in thymocytes of male and female mice. here, we provide the first evidence of a differential sex effect of rar on the reduction of thymocyte apoptosis with males showing lesser levels of caspase-3-mediated apoptosis than females. analysis of transcriptomic profiles of  <dig> genes involved in apoptosis signaling in radio-adapted thymocytes identified  <dig> transcripts exhibiting differential expression between both sexes. among them, dlc <dig> and fis <dig> are closely related to the apoptosis mediated by the trp <dig> protein. our data demonstrate that overexpression of dlc <dig> and fis <dig> occur concomitantly with a highest accumulation of phosphoserine-18-trp <dig> and caspase- <dig> in radio-adapted thymocytes of female mice. in an opposite way, both down-modulation of fis <dig> and phosphoserine-389-trp <dig> accumulation appear to be associated with protection from thymocyte apoptosis mediated by caspase- <dig> in males.


CONCLUSIONS
transcriptomic analysis performed in this work reveals for the first time sex-specific differences in gene expression influenced by rar. our results also suggest a sex-dependent dual role for phosphoserine-18-trp <dig> and phosphoserine-389-trp <dig> in the regulation of the radio-adaptive response in mouse thymocytes.
