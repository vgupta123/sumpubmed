BACKGROUND
ultraviolet  radiation modulates secondary metabolism in the skin of vitis vinifera l. berries, which affects the final composition of both grapes and wines. the expression of several phenylpropanoid biosynthesis-related genes is regulated by uv radiation in grape berries. however, the complete portion of transcriptome and ripening processes influenced by solar uv radiation in grapes remains unknown.


RESULTS
whole genome arrays were used to identify the berry skin transcriptome modulated by the uv radiation received naturally in a mid-altitude tempranillo vineyard. uv radiation-blocking and transmitting filters were used to generate the experimental conditions. the expression of  <dig> genes was significantly altered by solar uv radiation. functional enrichment analysis of altered transcripts mainly pointed out that secondary metabolism-related transcripts were induced by uv radiation including vvfls <dig>  vvgt <dig> and vvgt <dig> flavonol biosynthetic genes and monoterpenoid biosynthetic genes. berry skin phenolic composition was also analysed to search for correlation with gene expression changes and uv-increased flavonols accumulation was the most evident impact. among regulatory genes, novel uv radiation-responsive transcription factors including vvmyb <dig> and three bhlh, together with known grapevine uv-responsive genes such as vvmybf <dig>  were identified. a transcriptomic meta-analysis revealed that genes up-regulated by uv radiation in the berry skin were also enriched in homologs of arabidopsis uvr <dig> uv-b photoreceptor-dependent uv-b -responsive genes. indeed, a search of the grapevine reference genomic sequence identified uv-b signalling pathway homologs and among them, vvhy5- <dig>  vvhy5- <dig> and vvrup were up-regulated by uv radiation in the berry skin.


CONCLUSIONS
results suggest that the uv-b radiation-specific signalling pathway is activated in the skin of grapes grown at mid-altitudes. the biosynthesis and accumulation of secondary metabolites, which are appreciated in winemaking and potentially confer cross-tolerance, were almost specifically triggered. this draws attention to viticultural practices that increase solar uv radiation on vineyards as they may improve grape features.
