BACKGROUND
the mature mouse oocyte contains the full complement of maternal proteins required for fertilization, reprogramming, zygotic gene activation , and the early stages of embryogenesis. however, due to limitations of traditional proteomics strategies, only a few abundantly expressed proteins have yet been identified. our laboratory applied a more effective strategy: one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and reverse-phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry  were employed to analyze the mature oocyte proteome in depth.


RESULTS
using this high-performance proteomic approach, we successfully identified  <dig> different proteins from  <dig> mature mouse oocytes lacking zona pellucidae. this is the largest catalog of mature mouse oocyte proteins compiled to date. according to their pattern of expression, we screened  <dig> maternal proteins with high levels of mrna expression both in oocytes and fertilized eggs. many well-known maternal effect proteins were included in this subset, including mater and npm <dig>  in addition, our mouse oocyte proteome was compared with a recently published mouse embryonic stem cell  proteome and  <dig> overlapping proteins were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
this proteomics analysis will be a valuable resource to aid in the characterization of important maternal proteins involved in oogenesis, fertilization, early embryonic development and in revealing their mechanisms of action.
