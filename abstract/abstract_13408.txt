BACKGROUND
phytomyxids  are cosmopolitan, obligate biotrophic protist parasites of plants, diatoms, oomycetes and brown algae. plasmodiophorids are best known as pathogens or vectors for viruses of arable crops . some phytomyxid parasites are of considerable economic and ecologic importance globally, and their hosts include important species in marine and terrestrial environments. however most phytomyxid diversity remains uncharacterised and knowledge of their relationships with host taxa is very fragmentary.


RESULTS
our molecular and morphological analyses of phytomyxid isolates–including for the first time oomycete and sea-grass parasites–demonstrate two cross-kingdom host shifts between closely related parasite species: between angiosperms and oomycetes, and from diatoms/brown algae to angiosperms. switching between such phylogenetically distant hosts is generally unknown in host-dependent eukaryote parasites. we reveal novel plasmodiophorid lineages in soils, suggesting a much higher diversity than previously known, and also present the most comprehensive phytomyxid phylogeny to date.


CONCLUSIONS
such large-scale host shifts between closely related obligate biotrophic eukaryote parasites is to our knowledge unique to phytomyxids. phytomyxids may readily adapt to a wide diversity of new hosts because they have retained the ability to covertly infect alternative hosts. a high cryptic diversity and ubiquitous distribution in agricultural and natural habitats implies that in a changing environment phytomyxids could threaten the productivity of key species in marine and terrestrial environments alike via host shift speciation.
