BACKGROUND
protein structures are flexible and often show conformational changes upon binding to other molecules to exert biological functions. as protein structures correlate with characteristic functions, structure comparison allows classification and prediction of proteins of undefined functions. however, most comparison methods treat proteins as rigid bodies and cannot retrieve similarities of proteins with large conformational changes effectively.


RESULTS
in this paper, we propose a novel descriptor, local average distance , based on either the geodesic distances  or euclidean distances  for pairwise flexible protein structure comparison. the proposed method was compared with  <dig> structural alignment methods and  <dig> shape descriptors on two datasets comprising hinge bending motions from the molmovdb, and the results have shown that our method outperformed all other methods regarding retrieving similar structures in terms of precision-recall curve, retrieval success rate, r-precision, mean average precision and f1-measure.


CONCLUSIONS
both ed- and gd-based lad descriptors are effective to search deformed structures and overcome the problems of self-connection caused by a large bending motion. we have also demonstrated that the ed-based lad is more robust than the gd-based descriptor. the proposed algorithm provides an alternative approach for blasting structure database, discovering previously unknown conformational relationships, and reorganizing protein structure classification.
