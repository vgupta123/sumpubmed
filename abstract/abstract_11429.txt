BACKGROUND
agrobacterium tumefaciens strain p <dig> is atypical, as the strain is not pathogenic and produces a for this species unusual quorum sensing signal, identified as n--homoserine lactone .


RESULTS
by sequence analysis and cloning, a functional luxi-like gene, named cini, has been identified on the at plasmid of a. tumefaciens strain p <dig>  insertion mutagenesis in the cini gene and transcriptome analyses permitted the identification of  <dig> cini-regulated genes in this strain, most of them encoding proteins responsible for the conjugative transfer of patp <dig>  among these genes were the avhb genes that encode a type  <dig> secretion system  involved in the formation of the conjugation apparatus, the tra genes that encode the dna transfer and replication  machinery and cini and two luxr orthologs. these last two genes, cinr and cinx, exhibit an unusual organization, with the cini gene surrounded by the two luxr orthologs. conjugation experiments confirmed that the conjugative transfer of patp <dig> is regulated by 3oh,c8-hsl. root colonization experiments indicated that the quorum sensing regulation of the conjugation of the patp <dig> does not confer a gain or a loss of fitness to the bacterial host in the tomato plant rhizosphere.


CONCLUSIONS
this work is the first identification of the occurrence of a quorum sensing regulation of the pat conjugation phenomenon in agrobacterium.
