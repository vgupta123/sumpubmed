BACKGROUND
plant viral infections disturb defense regulatory networks during tissue invasion. emerging evidence demonstrates that a significant proportion of these alterations are mediated by hormone imbalances. although the della proteins have been reported to be central players in hormone cross-talk, their role in the modulation of hormone signaling during virus infections remains unknown.


RESULTS
this work revealed that tmv-cg coat protein  suppresses the salicylic acid  signaling pathway without altering defense hormone sa or jasmonic acid  levels in arabidopsis thaliana. furthermore, it was observed that the expression of cgcp reduces plant growth and delays the timing of floral transition. quantitative rt-qpcr analysis of della target genes showed that cgcp alters relative expression of several target genes, indicating that the della proteins mediate transcriptional changes produced by cgcp expression. analyses by fluorescence confocal microscopy showed that cgcp stabilizes della proteins accumulation in the presence of gibberellic acid  and that the della proteins are also stabilized during tmv-cg virus infections. moreover, della proteins negatively modulated defense transcript profiles during tmv-cg infection. as a result, tmv-cg accumulation was significantly reduced in the quadruple-della mutant arabidopsis plants compared to wild type plants.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these results demonstrate that cgcp negatively regulates the salicylic acid-mediated defense pathway by stabilizing the della proteins during arabidopsis thaliana viral infection, suggesting that cgcp alters the stability of dellas as a mechanism of negative modulation of antiviral defense responses.
