BACKGROUND
the nuclear receptors of the nr2e class play important roles in pattern formation and nervous system development. based on a phylogenetic analysis of dna-binding domains, we define two conserved groups of orthologous nr2e genes: the nr2e <dig> subclass, which includes c. elegans nhr- <dig>  drosophila tailless and dissatisfaction, and vertebrate tlx , and the nr2e <dig> subclass, which includes c. elegans fax- <dig> and vertebrate pnr . pnr and tll nuclear receptors have been shown to bind the hexamer half-site aagtca, instead of the hexamer aggtca recognized by most other nuclear receptors, suggesting unique dna-binding properties for nr2e class members.


RESULTS
we show that nr2e <dig> subclass member fax- <dig>  unlike nhr- <dig> and other nr2e <dig> subclass members, binds to hexamer half-sites with relaxed specificity: it will bind hexamers with the sequence angtca, although it prefers a purine to a pyrimidine at the second position. we use site-directed mutagenesis to demonstrate that the difference between fax- <dig> and nhr- <dig> binding preference is partially mediated by a conserved subclass-specific asparagine or aspartate residue at position  <dig> of the dna-binding domain. this amino acid position is part of the "p box" that plays a critical role in defining binding site specificity and has been shown to make hydrogen-bond contacts to the second position of the hexamer in co-crystal structures for other nuclear receptors. the relaxed specificity allows fax- <dig> to bind a much larger repertoire of half-sites than nhr- <dig>  while nr2e <dig> class proteins bind both monomeric and dimeric sites, the nr2e <dig> class proteins bind only dimeric sites. the presence of a single strong site adjacent to a very weak site allows dimeric fax- <dig> binding, further increasing the number of dimeric binding sites to which fax- <dig> may bind in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings identify subclass-specific dna-binding specificities and dimerization properties for the nr2e <dig> and nr2e <dig> subclasses. for the nr2e <dig> protein nhr- <dig>  asp- <dig> permits binding to aagtca half-sites, while asn- <dig> permits binding to aggtca half-sites. the apparent conservation of dna-binding properties between vertebrate and nematode nr2e receptors allows for the possibility of evolutionarily-conserved regulatory patterns.
