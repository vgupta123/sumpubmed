BACKGROUND
lipids are stored within cells in lipid droplets . they consist of a core of neutral lipids surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids, predominantly phosphatidylcholine . lds are very dynamic and can rapidly change in size upon lipid uptake or release. these dynamics require a fast adaptation of ld surface. we have recently shown that two lands cycle pc synthesizing enyzmes, lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> can localize to the ld surface.


RESULTS
here, we show that knock-down of both enzymes leads to an increase in ld size without changes in the total amount of neutral lipids, while interference with the de-novo kennedy pathway pc biosynthesis is associated with changes in triacylglyceride synthesis. we show that function of lpcat <dig> and  <dig> is conserved in drosophila melanogaster by the ortholog cg <dig>  furthermore we demonstrate that modulation of the ld pool by lpcat <dig> influences the release of lipoprotein from liver cells.


CONCLUSIONS
activity of the kennedy pathway regulates the balance between phospholipids and neutral lipids, while the lands cycle regulates lipid droplet size by regulating surface availability and influencing surface to volume ratio. differences in lipid droplet size may account for differences in lipid dynamics and be relevant to understand lipid overload diseases.
