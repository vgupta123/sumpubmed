BACKGROUND
the aim of this study is to compare the diagnostic performance of the line probe assay  with conventional multiplex polymerase chain reaction  for streptococcus pneumoniae as well as real-time pcr for neisseria meningitidis and haemophilus influenzae type b  in cerebrospinal fluid  samples from children during the multicenter national surveillance of bacterial meningitis between the years  <dig> and  <dig> in turkey.


RESULTS
during the study period  <dig> subjects were enrolled and among them  <dig>  met the criteria for probable bacterial meningitis. the mean age of subjects was 51 ± 47 months . we performed the line probe assay in  <dig>  csf samples of  <dig> probable bacterial meningitis cases, of whom  <dig>  were negative,  <dig>  were positive for s. pneumoniae,  <dig>  were positive for h. influenzae type b, and  <dig>  were positive for n. meningitidis. the lpa was positive in  <dig> of  <dig>  s. pneumoniae samples,  <dig> of  <dig>  n. meningitidis samples and  <dig> of  <dig>  hib samples in csf culture-positive cases. the specificity of the lpa for all of s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae type b, and n. meningitidis was 88% , when using the standard pcr as a reference. the specificity of lpa for each of s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae type b, and n. meningitidis was 93% , 96% , and 99% , respectively. for all of s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae type b and n. meningitidis the sensitivity of the lpa was 76%  and for each of s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae type b and n. meningitidis was 72% , 88% , and 81% , respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the lpa assay can be used to detect common bacterial meningitis pathogens in csf samples, but the assay requires further improvement.
