BACKGROUND
olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug with high clinical efficacy, but which can cause severe weight gain and metabolic disorders in treated patients. blockade of the histamine  <dig>  receptors is believed to play a crucial role in olanzapine induced weight gain, whereas the therapeutic effects of this drug are mainly attributed to its favourable serotoninergic 2a and dopamine  <dig>  receptor binding affinity ratios.


RESULTS
we have synthesized novel olanzapine analogues 8a and 8b together with the already known derivative 8c and we have examined their respective in vitro affinities for the 5ht2a, d <dig>  and h <dig> receptors.


CONCLUSIONS
we suggest that thienobenzodiazepines 8b and 8c with lower binding affinity for the h <dig> receptors, but similar 5ht2a/d <dig> receptor binding affinity ratios to those of olanzapine. these compounds may offer a better pharmacological profile than olanzapine for treating patients with schizophrenia.
