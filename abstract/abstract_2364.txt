BACKGROUND
in the intracellular pathogen brucella spp., the activation of the stringent response, a global regulatory network providing rapid adaptation to growth-affecting stress conditions such as nutrient deficiency, is essential for replication in the host. a single, bi-functional enzyme rsh catalyzes synthesis and hydrolysis of the alarmone ppgpp, responsible for differential gene expression under stringent conditions.


RESULTS
cdna microarray analysis allowed characterization of the transcriptional profiles of the b. suis  <dig> wild-type and Î”rsh mutant in a minimal medium, partially mimicking the nutrient-poor intramacrophagic environment. a total of  <dig> genes  were differentially expressed in a rsh-dependent manner, of which  <dig> were up-, and  <dig> were down-regulated. the pleiotropic character of the response was confirmed, as the genes encoded an important number of transcriptional regulators, cell envelope proteins, stress factors, transport systems, and energy metabolism proteins. virulence genes such as narg and sodc, respectively encoding respiratory nitrate reductase and superoxide dismutase, were under the positive control of ppgpp, as well as expression of the cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidase, essential for chronic murine infection. methionine was the only amino acid whose biosynthesis was absolutely dependent on stringent response in b. suis.


CONCLUSIONS
the study illustrated the complexity of the processes involved in adaptation to nutrient starvation, and contributed to a better understanding of the correlation between stringent response and brucella virulence. most interestingly, it clearly indicated ppgpp-dependent cross-talk between at least three stress responses playing a central role in brucella adaptation to the host: nutrient, oxidative, and low-oxygen stress.
