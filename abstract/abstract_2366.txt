BACKGROUND
the y chromosome of mammals is particularly prone to accumulate genes related to male fertility. however, the high rate of molecular evolution on this chromosome predicts reduced power to the across-species comparative approach in identifying male-specific genes that are essential for sperm production in humans. we performed a comprehensive analysis of expression of y-linked transcripts and their x homologues in several human tissues, and in biopsies of infertile patients, in an attempt to identify new testis-specific genes involved in human spermatogenesis.


RESULTS
we present evidence that one of the primate-specific y-linked ribosomal protein genes, rps4y <dig>  has restricted expression in testis and prostate, in contrast with its x-linked homologue, which is ubiquitously expressed. moreover, we have determined by highly specific quantitative real time pcr that rps4y <dig> is more highly expressed in testis biopsies containing germ cells. the in silico analysis of the promoter region of rps4y <dig> revealed several differences relative to rps4y <dig>  the more widely expressed paralogue from which y <dig> has originated through duplication. finally, through comparative modelling we obtained the three dimensional models of the human s <dig> proteins, revealing a conserved structure. interestingly, rps4y <dig> shows different inter-domain contacts and the potential to establish specific interactions.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that one of the y-linked copies of the ribosomal protein s <dig> is preferentially expressed during spermatogenesis and might be important for germ cell development. even though rps4y <dig> has accumulated several amino acid changes following its duplication from rps4y <dig>  approximately  <dig> million years ago, the evolution of the y-encoded rps <dig> proteins is structurally constrained. however, the exclusive expression pattern of rps4y <dig> and the novelties acquired at the c-terminus of the protein may indicate some degree of functional specialisation of this protein in spermatogenesis.
