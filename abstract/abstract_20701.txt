BACKGROUND
the ascomycete fungus cercospora zeae-maydis is an aggressive foliar pathogen of maize that causes substantial losses annually throughout the western hemisphere. despite its impact on maize production, little is known about the regulation of pathogenesis in c. zeae-maydis at the molecular level. the objectives of this study were to generate a collection of expressed sequence tags  from c. zeae-maydis and evaluate their expression during vegetative, infectious, and reproductive growth.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  ests was obtained from five cdna libraries constructed from vegetative and sporulating cultures of c. zeae-maydis. the ests, grouped into  <dig> clusters and  <dig> singlets, represented  <dig> putative unique genes. of these, 36% encoded proteins similar  to characterized or annotated proteins from the ncbi non-redundant database representing diverse molecular functions and biological processes based on gene ontology  classification. we identified numerous, previously undescribed genes with potential roles in photoreception, pathogenesis, and the regulation of development as well as zephyr, a novel, actively transcribed transposable element. differential expression of selected genes was demonstrated by real-time pcr, supporting their proposed roles in vegetative, infectious, and reproductive growth.


CONCLUSIONS
novel genes that are potentially involved in regulating growth, development, and pathogenesis were identified in c. zeae-maydis, providing specific targets for characterization by molecular genetics and functional genomics. the est data establish a foundation for future studies in evolutionary and comparative genomics among species of cercospora and other groups of plant pathogenic fungi.
