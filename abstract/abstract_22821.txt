BACKGROUND
the triosephosphate isomerase -barrel fold occurs frequently in the proteomes of different organisms, and the known tim-barrel proteins have been found to play diverse functional roles. to accelerate the exploration of the sequence-structure protein landscape in the tim-barrel fold, a computational tool that allows sensitive detection of tim-barrel proteins is required.


RESULTS
to develop a new tim-barrel protein identification method in this work, we consider three descriptors: a sequence-alignment-based descriptor using psi-blast e-values and bit scores, a descriptor based on secondary structure element alignment , and a descriptor based on the occurrence of prosite functional motifs. with the assistance of support vector machine , the three descriptors were combined to obtain a new method with improved performance, which we call tim-finder. when tested on the whole proteome of bacillus subtilis, tim-finder is able to detect  <dig> tim-barrel proteins at a 99% confidence level, outperforming the psi-blast search as well as one existing fold recognition method.


CONCLUSIONS
tim-finder can serve as a competitive tool for proteome-wide tim-barrel protein identification. the tim-finder web server is freely accessible at http:// <dig> . <dig> /tim-finder/.
