BACKGROUND
streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis  causes invasive streptococcal infections, including streptococcal toxic shock syndrome , as does lancefield group a streptococcus pyogenes . we sequenced the entire genome of sdse strain ggs_ <dig> isolated from a patient with stss.


RESULTS
we found that ggs_ <dig> consisted of a circular genome of  <dig> , <dig> bp. comparative analyses among bacterial genomes indicated that ggs_ <dig> was most closely related to gas. ggs_ <dig> and gas, but not other streptococci, shared a number of virulence factor genes, including genes encoding streptolysin o, nadase, and streptokinase a, distantly related to sic , suggesting the importance of these factors in the development of invasive disease. ggs_ <dig> contained  <dig> prophages, with one containing a virulence factor gene for streptodornase. all  <dig> prophages were significantly similar to gas prophages that carry virulence factor genes, indicating that these prophages had transferred these genes between pathogens. sdse was found to contain a gene encoding a superantigen, streptococcal exotoxin type g, but lacked several genes present in gas that encode virulence factors, such as other superantigens, cysteine protease speb, and hyaluronan synthase operon hasabc. similar to ggs_ <dig>  the sdse strains contained larger numbers of clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats  spacers than did gas, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer via streptococcal phages between sdse and gas is somewhat restricted, although they share phage species.


CONCLUSIONS
genome wide comparisons of sdse with gas indicate that sdse is closely and quantitatively related to gas. sdse, however, lacks several virulence factors of gas, including superantigens, spe-b and the hasabc operon. crispr spacers may limit the horizontal transfer of phage encoded gas virulence genes into sdse. these findings may provide clues for dissecting the pathological roles of the virulence factors in sdse and gas that cause stss.
