BACKGROUND
all cows experience bacterial contamination and tissue injury in the uterus postpartum, instigating a local inflammatory immune response. however mechanisms that control inflammation and achieve a physiologically functioning endometrium, while avoiding disease in the postpartum cow are not succinctly defined. this study aimed to identify novel candidate genes indicative of inflammation resolution during involution in healthy beef cows. previous histological analysis of the endometrium revealed elevated inflammation 15â€‰days postpartum  which was significantly decreased by  <dig> dpp. the current study generated a genome-wide transcriptomic profile of endometrial biopsies from these cows at both time points using mrna-seq. the pathway analysis tool goseq identified kegg pathways enriched by significantly differentially expressed genes at both time points. novel candidate genes associated with inflammatory resolution were subsequently validated in additional postpartum animals using quantitative real-time pcr .


RESULTS
mrna-seq revealed  <dig>  significantly differentially expressed genes,  <dig> of which were increased  <dig> dpp and  <dig>  were increased  <dig> dpp. early postpartum, enriched immune pathways  included the t cell receptor signalling pathway, graft-versus-host disease and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways. however  <dig> dpp, where the majority of genes were differentially expressed, the enrichment  of tissue repair and proliferative activity pathways was observed. nineteen candidate genes selected from mrna-seq results, were independently assessed by qrt-pcr in additional postpartum cows  at both time points. saa1/ <dig>  gata <dig>  igf <dig>  shc <dig>  and serpina <dig> genes were significantly elevated  <dig> dpp and are functionally associated with tissue repair and the restoration of uterine homeostasis postpartum.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study reveal an early activation of the immune response which undergoes a temporal functional change toward tissue proliferation and regeneration during endometrial involution in healthy postpartum cows. these molecular changes mirror the activation and resolution of endometrial inflammation during involution previously classified by the degree of neutrophil infiltration. saa1/ <dig>  gata <dig>  igf <dig>  shc <dig>  and serpina <dig> genes may become potential markers for resolution of endometrial inflammation in the postpartum cow.
