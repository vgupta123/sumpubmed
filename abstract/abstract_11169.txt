BACKGROUND
elevations of serum prolactin  are associated with an increased risk for breast cancer. prl signaling through its prolactin receptor  involves the jak2/stat <dig> pathway. luciferase-based reporter assays have been widely used to evaluate the activity of this pathway. however, the existing reporters are often not sensitive enough to monitor the effect of prl in this pathway.


RESULTS
in this study, a new biologically relevant reporter, pgl4-cish, was generated to study the prl/jak2/stat <dig> signaling pathway. the sensitivity of pgl4-cish to detect prl was superior to that of several other commonly utilized stat5-responsive reporters. interestingly, the enhanced function pgl4-cish was restricted to the estrogen receptor positive  human breast cancer cell lines t47d and mcf <dig>  but not in the er-mda- <dig>  bt- <dig>  or mcf10a cell lines. overexpression of stat <dig> further enhanced the effect of prl on pgl4-cish.


CONCLUSIONS
these studies demonstrate that pgl4-cish is a novel and sensitive reporter for assessing the activity of the prl/stat <dig> signaling pathway in the er+ human breast cancer cells.
