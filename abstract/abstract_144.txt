BACKGROUND
gluten proteins can induce celiac disease  in genetically susceptible individuals. in cd patients gluten-derived peptides are presented to the immune system, which leads to a cd4+ t-cell mediated immune response and inflammation of the small intestine. however, not all gluten proteins contain t-cell stimulatory epitopes. gluten proteins are encoded by multigene loci present on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> of the three different genomes of hexaploid bread wheat  .


RESULTS
the effects of deleting individual gluten loci on both the level of t-cell stimulatory epitopes in the gluten proteome and the technological properties of the flour were analyzed using a set of deletion lines of triticum aestivum cv. chinese spring. the reduction of t-cell stimulatory epitopes was analyzed using monoclonal antibodies that recognize t-cell epitopes present in gluten proteins. the deletion lines were technologically tested with respect to dough mixing properties and dough rheology. the results show that removing the α-gliadin locus from the short arm of chromosome  <dig> of the d-genome  resulted in a significant decrease in the presence of t-cell stimulatory epitopes but also in a significant loss of technological properties. however, removing the ω-gliadin, γ-gliadin, and lmw-gs loci from the short arm of chromosome  <dig> of the d-genome  removed t-cell stimulatory epitopes from the proteome while maintaining technological properties.


CONCLUSIONS
the consequences of these data are discussed with regard to reducing the load of t-cell stimulatory epitopes in wheat, and to contributing to the design of cd-safe wheat varieties.
