BACKGROUND
plant matrix metalloproteinases  are conserved proteolytic enzymes found in a wide range of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant species. acting on the plant extracellular matrix, they play crucial roles in many aspects of plant physiology including growth, development and the response to stresses such as pathogen attack.


RESULTS
we have identified the first tobacco mmp, designated ntmmp <dig>  and have isolated the corresponding cdna sequence from the tobacco suspension cell line by- <dig>  the overall domain structure of ntmmp <dig> is similar to known mmp sequences, although certain features suggest it may be constitutively active rather than dependent on proteolytic processing. the protein appears to be expressed in two forms with different molecular masses, both of which are enzymatically active as determined by casein zymography. exchanging the catalytic domain of ntmmp <dig> with green fluorescent protein  facilitated subcellular localization by confocal laser scanning microscopy, showing the protein is normally inserted into the plasma membrane. the ntmmp <dig> gene is expressed constitutively at a low level but can be induced by exposure to bacterial pathogens.


CONCLUSIONS
our biochemical analysis of ntmmp <dig> together with bioinformatic data on the primary sequence indicate that ntmmp <dig> is a constitutively-active protease. given its induction in response to bacterial pathogens and its localization in the plasma membrane, we propose a role in pathogen defense at the cell periphery.
