BACKGROUND
mycoplasma bovis  is a major, but often overlooked, pathogen documented to cause respiratory disease, mastitis, and arthritis in cattle throughout china since  <dig>  here, we report the development of a direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  to detect m. bovis antibody.


RESULTS
we used a recombinant p <dig> protein and monoclonal antibody  10e. mab 10e, prepared against the recombinant p <dig> protein of m. bovis, identified all m. bovis strains with no cross-reactivity with other related pathogens. coating micro plates with p <dig> protein instead of whole m. bovis cells as well as the use of mab 10e produced a specific and sensitive dc-elisa for m. bovis antibody detection with a cut-off percent inhibition  value of 32%. compared with two commercial indirect elisa  kits, our dc-elisa offered a higher positive detection rate in  <dig> clinical bovine serum samples.


CONCLUSIONS
a rapid, sensitive, and reliable serological diagnosis method was developed for m. bovis, which can facilitate m. bovis surveillance, assisting researchers in understanding the ecology and epidemiology of m. bovis.
