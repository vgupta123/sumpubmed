BACKGROUND
laccases are enzymes that couple the oxidation of substrates with the reduction of dioxygen to water. they are the simplest members of the multi-copper oxidases and contain at least two types of copper centres; a mononuclear t <dig> and a trinuclear that includes two t <dig> and one t <dig> copper ions. substrate oxidation takes place at the mononuclear centre whereas reduction of oxygen to water occurs at the trinuclear centre.


RESULTS
in this study, the cota laccase from bacillus subtilis was used as a model to understand the mechanisms taking place at the molecular level, with a focus in the trinuclear centre. the structures of the holo-protein and of the oxidised form of the apo-protein, which has previously been reconstituted in vitro with cu, have been determined. the former has a dioxygen moiety between the t <dig> coppers, while the latter has a monoatomic oxygen, here interpreted as a hydroxyl ion. the uv/visible spectra of these two forms have been analysed in the crystals and compared with the data obtained in solution. theoretical calculations on these and other structures of cota were used to identify groups that may be responsible for channelling the protons that are needed for reduction of dioxygen to water.


CONCLUSIONS
these results present evidence that glu  <dig> is the only proton-active group in the vicinity of the trinuclear centre. this strongly suggests that this residue may be responsible for channelling the protons needed for the reduction. these results are compared with other data available for these enzymes, highlighting similarities and differences within laccases and multicopper oxidases.
