BACKGROUND
cultivated tomato  has narrow genetic diversity that makes it difficult to identify polymorphisms between elite germplasm. we explored array-based single feature polymorphism  discovery as a high-throughput approach for marker development in cultivated tomato.


RESULTS
three varieties, fl <dig> , oh <dig> , and pi <dig>  were used as a source of genomic dna for hybridization to oligonucleotide arrays. identification of sfps was based on outlier detection using regression analysis of normalized hybridization data within a probe set for each gene. a subset of  <dig> putative sfps was sequenced for validation. the rate of validation depended on the desired level of significance  used to define the confidence interval , and ranged from 76% for polymorphisms identified at α ≤ 10- <dig> to 60% for those identified at α ≤ 10- <dig>  validation percentage reached a plateau between α ≤ 10- <dig> and α ≤ 10- <dig>  but failure to identify known sfps  increased dramatically at α ≤ 10- <dig>  trough sequence validation, we identified  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels in  <dig> loci. sixty loci contained ≥  <dig> snps per locus. we used a subset of validated snps for genetic diversity analysis of  <dig> tomato varieties and accessions. pairwise estimation of θ  suggested significant differentiation between collections of fresh-market, processing, vintage, latin american , and s. pimpinellifolium accessions. the fresh-market and processing groups displayed high genetic diversity relative to vintage and landrace groups. furthermore, the patterns of snp variation indicated that domestication and early breeding practices have led to progressive genetic bottlenecks while modern breeding practices have reintroduced genetic variation into the crop from wild species. finally, we examined the ratio of non-synonymous  to synonymous substitutions  for  <dig> loci with multiple snps . six of  <dig> loci showed ratios of ka/ks ≥  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
array-based sfp discovery was an efficient method to identify a large number of molecular markers for genetics and breeding in elite tomato germplasm. patterns of sequence variation across five major tomato groups provided insight into to the effect of human selection on genetic variation.
