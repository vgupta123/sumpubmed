BACKGROUND
the metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcription  <dig>  is a highly conserved long non-coding rna  gene. previous studies showed that malat <dig> is abundantly expressed in many tissues and involves in promoting tumor growth and metastasis by modulating gene expression and target protein activities. however, little is known about the biological function and regulation mechanism of malat <dig> in normal cell proliferation.


RESULTS
in this study we conformed that malat <dig> is highly conserved across vast evolutionary distances amongst  <dig> species of mammals in terms of sequence, and found that mouse malat <dig> expresses in tissues of liver, kidney, lung, heart, testis, spleen and brain, but not in skeletal muscle. after treating erythroid myeloid lymphoid  cells with all-trans retinoic acid , we investigated the expression and regulation of malat <dig> during hematopoietic differentiation, the results showed that atra significantly down regulates malat <dig> expression during the differentiation of eml cells. mouse lrh  cells that represent the early-stage progenitor cells show a high level of malat <dig> expression, while lrb  cells that represent the late-stage progenitor cells had no detectable expression of malat <dig> 

knockdown experiment showed that depletion of malat <dig> inhibits the eml cell proliferation. along with the down regulation of malat <dig>  the tumor suppressor gene p <dig> was up regulated during the differentiation. interestingly, we found two p <dig> binding motifs with help of bioinformatic tools, and the following chromatin immunoprecipitation  test conformed that p <dig> acts as a transcription repressor that binds to malat1’s promoter. furthermore, we testified that p <dig> over expression in eml cells causes down regulation of malat <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study indicates malat <dig> plays a critical role in maintaining the proliferation potential of early-stage hematopoietic cells. in addition to its biological function, the study also uncovers the regulation pattern of malat <dig> expression mediated by p <dig> in hematopoietic differentiation. our research shed a light on exploring the malat <dig> biological role including therapeutic significance to inhibit the proliferation potential of malignant cells.
