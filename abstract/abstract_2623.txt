BACKGROUND
the salmonella gallinarum  lon/cpxr deletion mutant jol <dig> was developed as a live vaccine candidate for fowl typhoid , and a sg mutant secreting an escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin b subunit , designated jol <dig>  was recently constructed as an adjuvant strain for oral vaccination against ft. in this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective properties of the sg mutant jol <dig> and the ltb adjuvant strain jol <dig> in order to establish a prime and boost immunization strategy for each strain. in addition, we compared the increase in body weight, the immunogenicity, the egg production rates, and the bacteriological egg contamination of these strains with those of sg 9r, a widely used commercial vaccine.


RESULTS
plasma igg, intestinal secretory iga , and cell-mediated responses were significantly induced after a boost inoculation with a mixture of jol <dig> and jol <dig>  and significant reductions in the mortality of chickens challenged with a wild-type sg strain were observed in the immunized groups. there were no significant differences in increases in body weight, cell-mediated immune responses, or systemic igg responses between our vaccine mixture and the sg 9r vaccine groups. however, there was a significant elevation in intestinal siga in chickens immunized with our mixture at  <dig> weeks post-prime-immunization and at  <dig> weeks post-boost-immunization, while siga levels in sg 9r-immunized chickens were not significantly elevated compared to the control. in addition, the sg strain was not detected in the eggs of chickens immunized with our mixture.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that immunization with the ltb-adjuvant strain jol <dig> can significantly increase the immune response, and provide efficient protection against ft with no side effects on body weight, egg production, or egg contamination.
