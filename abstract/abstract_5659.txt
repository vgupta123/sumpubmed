BACKGROUND
norbin is a neuron-specific, cytosolic protein that interacts with the metabotropic glutamate receptor  <dig>  and has a profound impact on mglur <dig> signaling. yet, little is known about its synaptic distribution.


RESULTS
here we have analyzed the spatial relationship between norbin, postsynaptic density protein  <dig> , actin and mglur <dig> in spines using super-resolution microscopy. norbin was found to have a high degree of colocalization with actin and a lower degree of colocalization with psd- <dig>  co-immunoprecipitation studies confirmed that interaction occurs between norbin and actin, but not between norbin and psd- <dig>  norbin was also found to have a high degree of colocalization with the perisynaptically located mglur <dig>  findings based on structured illumination microscopy  of exogenous expressed norbin-gfp were confirmed by stimulated emission depletion microscopy  of immunolabeled endogenous norbin.


CONCLUSIONS
norbin associates with actin rather than with psd- <dig> in dendritic spines. results regarding protein localization and colocalization performed with conventional confocal microscopy must be interpreted with great caution. the now available super-resolution microscopy techniques provide more accurate information about sub-cellular protein localization than previously was possible.
