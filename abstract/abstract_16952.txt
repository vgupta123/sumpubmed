BACKGROUND
extraintestinal pathogenic escherichia coli  strains of serotype o1:k1:h7/nm are frequently implicated in neonatal meningitis, urinary tract infections and septicemia in humans. they are also commonly isolated from colibacillosis in poultry. studies to determine the similarities of expec from different origins have indicated that avian strains potentially have zoonotic properties.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> expec o1:k1:h7/nm isolates  originated from four countries were characterized by phylogenetic pcr grouping, multilocus sequence typing , pulsed field gel electrophoresis  and genotyping based on several genes known for their association with expec or avian pathogenic escherichia coli  virulence.

apec and human expec isolates differed significantly in their assignments to phylogenetic groups, being phylogroup b <dig> more prevalent among apec than among human expec , whereas phylogroup d was almost exclusively associated with human expec . seven virulence genes showed significant differences, being fimavmt <dig> and sat genes linked to human isolates, while papgii, tsh, iron, cvac and iss were significantly associated to apec. by mlst,  <dig> of  <dig> expec belonging to phylogroup b <dig>  and  <dig> of  <dig> belonging to phylogroup d exhibited the sequence types  st <dig> and st <dig>  respectively. additionally, two novel sts  were established. considering strains sharing the same st, phylogenetic group, virulence genotype and pfge cluster to belong to the same subclone, five subclones were detected; one of those grouped six strains of human and animal origin from two countries.


CONCLUSIONS
present results reveal that the clonal group b <dig> o1:k1:h7/nm st <dig>  detected in strains of animal and human origin, recovered from different dates and geographic sources, provides evidence that some apec isolates may act as potential pathogens for humans and, consequently, poultry as a foodborne source, suggesting no host specificity for this type of isolates. a novel and important finding has been the detection of the clonal group d o1:k1:h7/nm st <dig> almost exclusively in humans, carrying pathogenic genes linked to the phylogenetic group d. this finding would suggest d o1:k1:h7/nm st <dig> as a host specific pathotype for humans.
