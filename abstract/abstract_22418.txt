BACKGROUND
despite its high number of endemic deciduous broad-leaved species in china’s warm-temperate zone, far less attention has been paid to phylogeographic studies in this region. in this work, the phylogeographic history of forsythia suspensa endemic to china’s warm-temperate zone was investigated to explore the effect of climate change during the pleistocene on the distribution of this deciduous broad-leaved species in china.


RESULTS
the cpdna data revealed seven phylogeographical groups corresponding to geographical regions. by contrast, the nrdna data supported the samples clustered into three groups, which was inconsistent with separate geographical regions supported by cpdna data. ecological niche modeling showed that the climatically suitable area during the cold period was larger than that during the warm period.


CONCLUSIONS
both molecular data and ecological niche modeling indicated that f. suspensa expanded to nearby low-elevation plains in the glacial periods, and retreated to mountaintops during interglacial warmer stages. this study thus supported that f. suspensa persisted in situ during the glacial of the pleistocene with enlarged distribution area, contrary to the hypothesis of long distance southward migration or large-scale range contraction.
