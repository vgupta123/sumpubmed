BACKGROUND
 staphylococcus aureus  secretes esxa and esxb, two small polypeptides of the wxg <dig> family of proteins. genetic analyses have shown that production and secretion of esxa and esxb require an intact esat- <dig> secretion system , a cluster of genes that is conserved in many firmicutes and encompasses  esxa  and  esxb . here, we characterize essb, one of the proteins encoded by the ess cluster. essb is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria and belongs to the cluster of orthologous groups of protein cog <dig> with no known function.


RESULTS
by generating an internal deletion in  essb , we demonstrate that essb is required for secretion of esxa. we use a polyclonal antibody to identify essb and show that the protein fractionates with the plasma membrane of  s. aureus . yet, when produced in  escherichia coli,  essb remains mostly soluble and the purified protein assembles into a highly organized oligomer that can be visualized by electron microscopy. production of truncated essb variants in wild-type  s. aureus  confers a dominant negative phenotype on esxa secretion.


CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here support the notion that essb may oligomerize and interact with other membrane components to form the wxg100-specific translocon in  s. aureus .
