BACKGROUND
previous work showed that mirnas play key roles in the regulation of metamorphosis in the hemimetabolan species blattella germanica. to gain insight about which mirnas might be important, we have constructed two mirna libraries, one of the penultimate, pre-metamorphic nymphal instar  and the other of the last, metamorphic nymphal instar .


RESULTS
high throughput sequencing gave  <dig> canonical mirnas present in the n <dig> and n <dig> libraries, although at different proportions in each. comparison of both libraries led to the identification of three and  <dig> mirnas significantly more expressed in n <dig> and n <dig> respectively. twelve of these  <dig> mirnas were then investigated further by qrt-pcr and results indicated that mir-252-3p was well expressed in n <dig> but not in n <dig>  whereas let-7-5p, mir-100-5p and mir-125-5p showed the reverse pattern. 20-hydroxyecdysone  tended to stimulate mirna expression, whereas juvenile hormone  inhibited the 20e stimulatory effect. expression of let- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> was increased by 20e, which has also been observed in d. melanogaster. the only mirna that was inhibited by 20e was mir-252-3p. the involvement of let- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in metamorphosis has been demonstrated in other insects. depletion of mir-252-3p caused growth and developmental delays, which suggests that this mirna is involved in regulating these processes prior to metamorphosis.


CONCLUSIONS
the comparative analysis of mirna libraries from pre-metamorphic  and metamorphic stages  of b. germanica proved to be a useful tool to identify mirnas with roles in hemimetabolan metamorphosis. three mirnas emerged as important factors in the metamorphic stage : let-7-5p, mir-100-5p and mir-125-5p, whereas mir-252-3p appears to be important in the pre-metamorphic stage .
