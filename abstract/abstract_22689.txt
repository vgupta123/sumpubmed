BACKGROUND
animal and plant genomes produce numerous small rnas  that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally affecting metabolism, development, and epigenetic inheritance. in order to characterize the repertoire of endogenous smrnas and potential gene targets in dinoflagellates, we conducted smrna and mrna expression profiling over  <dig> experimental treatments of cultures from symbiodinium microadriaticum, a photosynthetic symbiont of scleractinian corals.


RESULTS
we identified a set of  <dig> novel smrnas that share stringent key features with functional micrornas from other model organisms. smrnas were predicted independently over all  <dig> treatments and their putative gene targets were identified. we found  <dig>  animal-like target sites in the 3'utrs of  <dig>  mrnas and  <dig> plant-like target sites in  <dig>  genes. we assembled a transcriptome of  <dig>  genes and determined differentially expressed genes  between treatments. heat stress was found to produce a much larger number of degs than other treatments that yielded only few degs. analysis of degs also revealed that minicircle-encoded photosynthesis proteins seem to be common targets of transcriptional regulation. furthermore, we identified the core rnai protein machinery in symbiodinium.


CONCLUSIONS
integration of smrna and mrna expression profiling identified a variety of processes that could be under microrna control, e.g. protein modification, signaling, gene expression, and response to dna damage. given that symbiodinium seems to have a paucity of transcription factors and differentially expressed genes, identification and characterization of its smrna repertoire establishes the possibility of a range of gene regulatory mechanisms in dinoflagellates acting post-transcriptionally.
