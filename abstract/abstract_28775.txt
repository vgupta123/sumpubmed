BACKGROUND
members of the complex n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor  subfamily of ionotropic glutamate receptors  conventionally assemble from nr <dig> and nr <dig> subunits, the composition of which determines receptor properties. hallmark features of conventional nmdars include the requirement for a coagonist, voltage-dependent block by mg2+, and high permeability for ca2+. both mg2+ sensitivity and ca2+ permeability are critically dependent on the amino acids at the n and n+ <dig> positions of nr <dig> and nr <dig>  the recently discovered nr <dig> subunits feature an unprecedented glycine-arginine combination at those critical sites within the pore. diheteromers assembled from nr <dig> and nr <dig> are not blocked by mg2+ and are not permeable for ca2+.


RESULTS
employing site-directed mutagenesis of receptor subunits, electrophysiological characterization of mutants in a heterologous expression system, and molecular modeling of the nmdar pore region, we have investigated the contribution of the unusual nr <dig> n and n+ <dig> site residues to the unique functional characteristics of receptors containing these subunits. contrary to previous studies, we provide evidence that both the nr <dig> n and n+ <dig> site amino acids are critically involved in mediating the unique pore properties. ca2+ permeability could be rescued by mutating the nr <dig> n site glycine to the nr1-like asparagine. voltage-dependent mg2+ block could be established by providing an mg2+ coordination site at either the nr <dig> n or n+ <dig> positions. conversely, "conventional" receptors assembled from nr <dig> and nr <dig> could be made mg2+ insensitive and ca2+ impermeable by equipping either subunit with the nr3-like glycine at their n positions, with a stronger contribution of the nr <dig> subunit.


CONCLUSIONS
this study sheds light on the structure-function relationship of the least characterized member of the nmdar subfamily. contrary to previous reports, we provide evidence for a critical functional involvement of the nr <dig> n and n+ <dig> site amino acids, and propose them to be the essential determinants for the unique pore properties mediated by this subunit.
