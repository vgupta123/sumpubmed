BACKGROUND
cetylpyridinium chloride  and sodium fluoride augment oral hygiene by inactivating bacteria and inhibiting enamel demineralisation, respectively. however, there are few reports in the literature documenting the antibacterial efficacy of their combined use in mouthrinses. we have used six experimental systems to compare the antibacterial effects of mouthrinses containing  <dig>  % cpc  or  <dig>  % cpc with sodium fluoride .


RESULTS
effects against planktonic bacteria were determined using viable counting , a redox dye  and viable counting . effects against saliva-derived biofilms were quantified using confocal microscopy and differential viable counting. inhibition of biofilm formation was evaluated by pre-treating hydroxyapatite coupons with mouthrinses prior to inoculation. otherwise-identical controls without cpc , were included throughout. compared to the controls, tfr and tr demonstrated significant antimicrobial effects in the redox assays, by viable counts  and in oral rinse samples . tfr and tr also significantly reduced the viability of oral biofilms. pre-treatment of hydroxyapatite with tfr and tr significantly inhibited biofilm formation . overall, there were no consistent differences in the activities of tr and tfr.


CONCLUSIONS
sodium fluoride did not influence the antibacterial and anti-biofilm potency of cpc-containing formulations, supporting the combined use of cpc and sodium fluoride in mouthrinses to control oral bacteria and protect tooth enamel.
