BACKGROUND
we have developed a new haplotyping program based on the combination of an iterative multiallelic em algorithm , bootstrap resampling and a pseudo gibbs sampler. the use of the iem-bootstrap procedure considerably reduces the space of possible haplotype configurations to be explored, greatly reducing computation time, while the adaptation of the gibbs sampler with a recombination model on this restricted space maintains high accuracy. on large snp datasets , we used a segmented approach based on a specific partition-ligation strategy. we compared this software, ishape , with reference programs such as phase, fastphase, and pl-em. analogously with phase, there are  <dig> versions of ishape: ishape <dig> which uses a simple coalescence model for the pseudo gibbs sampler step, and ishape <dig> which uses a recombination model instead.


RESULTS
we tested the program on  <dig> types of real snp datasets derived from hapmap: adjacent snps  and snps spaced by  <dig> kb . in both cases, we tested  <dig> replicates for each size:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> snps. for adjacent snps ishape <dig> is superior to the other software both in terms of speed and accuracy. for snps spaced by  <dig> kb, ishape <dig> yields similar results to phase <dig>  in terms of accuracy, and both outperform the other software.

in terms of speed, ishape <dig> runs about  <dig> times faster than phase <dig>  with  <dig> snps, and about  <dig> times faster with  <dig> snps. for the case of 5kb-spaced snps, fastphase may run faster with more than  <dig> snps.


CONCLUSIONS
these results show that the ishape heuristic approach for haplotyping is very competitive in terms of accuracy and speed and deserves to be evaluated extensively for possible future widespread use.
