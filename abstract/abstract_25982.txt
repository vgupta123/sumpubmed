BACKGROUND
plant transparent testa glabra  proteins regulate various developmental activities via the auxin signaling pathway. recently, we elucidated the developmental role of tobacco  ntttg <dig> in association with  <dig> genes that putatively encode auxin responsive factor  proteins, including ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  and ntarf <dig>  here we show that ntttg <dig> regulates tobacco growth and development by involving the ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  and ntarf <dig> genes, with the ntarf <dig> gene playing a predominant contribution.


RESULTS
independent silencing of the ntarf <dig> gene more strongly repressed tobacco growth than silencing the ntarf <dig> or ntarf <dig> gene and more effectively eradicated the growth enhancement effect of ntttg <dig> overexpression. in contrast, plant growth was not affected by silencing additional nine ntttg2-regulated ntarf genes. in double and triple gene silencing combinations, silencing the ntarf <dig> gene was more effective than silencing the ntarf <dig> or ntarf <dig> gene to repress growth as well as nullify growth enhancement. therefore, the ntarf <dig> predominantly cooperated with the ntarf <dig> and ntafr <dig> of the ntttg <dig> functional pathway. ntarf <dig> also contributed to ntttg2-regulated seed production as concurrent ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> overexpression played a synergistic role in seed production quantity, whereas concurrent silencing of both genes caused more severe seed abortion than single gene silencing. in plant cells, the ntttg <dig> protein facilitated the nuclear import of ntarf <dig> as well as increased its function as a transcription activator.


CONCLUSIONS
ntarf <dig> is an integral component of the ntttg <dig> functional pathway, which regulates tobacco growth and development.
