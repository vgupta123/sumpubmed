BACKGROUND
porcine circovirus type  <dig>  has been described as a non-cytopathic contaminant of the pk- <dig> cell line. several experimental infections with pcv <dig> failed to reproduce disease in pigs. therefore, pcv <dig> is generally accepted as non-pathogenic to pigs. to our knowledge, nothing is known about the outcome of pcv <dig> infections in porcine foetuses. this was examined in the present study.


RESULTS
nine foetuses from three sows were inoculated at  <dig> days of gestation: three with  <dig>  tcid <dig> of the pcv <dig> cell culture strain atcc-ccl <dig>  three with  <dig>  tcid <dig> of the pcv <dig> field strain  <dig> and three with cell culture medium . at  <dig> days post-inoculation, all  <dig> pcv1-inoculated and all  <dig> mock-inoculated foetuses had a normal external appearance. microscopic lesions characterized by severe haemorrhages were observed in the lungs of two foetuses inoculated with ccl <dig>  high pcv <dig> titres  were found in the lungs of the ccl33-inoculated foetuses. all other organs of the ccl33-inoculated foetuses and all the organs of the 3384-inoculated foetuses were negative  by virus titration. pcv1-positive cells  were found in the heart, lungs, spleen, liver, thymus and tonsils. pcr and dna sequencing of rep recovered ccl <dig> or  <dig> sequences from ccl33- or 3384-inoculated foetuses, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
from this study, it can be concluded that cell culture pcv <dig> can replicate efficiently and produce pathology in the lungs of porcine foetuses inoculated at  <dig> days of foetal life.
