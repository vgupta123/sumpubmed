BACKGROUND
since the finishing of the sequencing of the arabidopsis thaliana genome, the arabidopsis community and the annotator centers have been working on the improvement of gene annotation at the structural and functional levels. in this context, we have used the large catma resource on the arabidopsis transcriptome to search for genes missed by different annotation processes. probes on the catma microarrays are specific gene sequence tags  based on the cds models predicted by the eugene software. among the  <dig>  <dig> catma v <dig> gsts,  <dig> are in regions considered as intergenic by the tair annotation. we analyzed the cognate transcriptome data in the catma resource and carried out data-mining to characterize novel genes and improve gene models.


RESULTS
the statistical analysis of the results of more than  <dig> hybridized samples distributed among  <dig> organs provides an experimental validation for  <dig> novel genes. the hybridization evidence was confirmed by rt-pcr approaches for 88% of the  <dig> novel genes. comparisons with the current annotation show that these novel genes often encode small proteins, with an average size of  <dig> aa. our approach has also led to the improvement of pre-existing gene models through both the extension of  <dig> cds and the identification of  <dig> gene models erroneously constituted of two merged cds.


CONCLUSIONS
this work is a noticeable step forward in the improvement of the arabidopsis genome annotation. we increased the number of arabidopsis validated genes by  <dig> novel transcribed genes to which we associated several functional annotations such as expression profiles, sequence conservation in plants, cognate transcripts and protein motifs.
