BACKGROUND
salvianolic acid b  is a water-soluble component from danshen  with anti-oxidative and cell protective properties. sal b also has potential protective effects on renal diseases. tubular epithelial cells can undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition , which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of renal interstitial fibrosis  and is mainly regulated by tgf-β1/smads pathway. the aims of the study are to investigate the effect of sal b on tubular emt in vivo and in vitro, and to elucidate its underlying mechanism against emt related to tgf-β1/smads pathway.


RESULTS
for in vivo experiments, rif was induced in rats by oral administration of hgcl <dig> and prophylaxised with sal b and vitamin e. the protein expression of e-cadherin was down-regulated, while the expression of α-sma, tgf-β <dig>  tβr-i, p-smad2/ <dig> and the activity of matrix metalloproteinase- <dig>  were up-regulated in kidneys of model rats when compared with those of normal rats. in contrast, sal b and vitamin e significantly attenuated the expression of α-sma, tgf-β <dig>  tβr-i, p-smad2/ <dig>  and mmp- <dig> activity, but increased e-cadherin expression. for in vitro experiments, hk- <dig> cells were incubated with tgf-β <dig> to induce emt, and the cells were co-cultured with  <dig> and  <dig> μm sal b or sb- <dig> . tgf-β <dig> induced a typical emt in hk- <dig> cells, while it was blocked by sal b and sb- <dig>  as evidenced by blocking morphologic transformation, restoring e-cadherin and ck- <dig> expression, inhibiting α-sma expression and f-actin reorganization, and down-regulating mmp-2/ <dig> activities in tgf-β <dig> mediated hk- <dig> cells. furthermore, sal b and sb- <dig> profoundly down-regulated the expressions of tβr-i and p-smad2/ <dig> but prevented the decreased expression of smad <dig> in tgf-β <dig> stimulated hk- <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
sal b can prevent tubular emt in the fibrotic kidney induced by hgcl <dig> as well as hk- <dig> cells triggered by tgf-β <dig>  the mechanism of sal b is closely related to the regulation of tgf-β1/smads pathway, manifested as the inhibition of tgf-β <dig> expression, suppression of tβr-i expression and function, down-regulation of smad2/ <dig> phosphorylation, and restoration of the down-regulation of smad <dig>  as well as inhibition of mmp- <dig> activity.
