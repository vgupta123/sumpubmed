BACKGROUND
we have developed and fabricated a salmonid microarray containing cdnas representing  <dig>  genes. the genes spotted on the array have been stringently selected from atlantic salmon and rainbow trout expressed sequence tag  databases. the est databases presently contain over  <dig>  sequences from over  <dig> salmonid cdna libraries derived from a wide variety of tissues and different developmental stages. in order to evaluate the utility of the microarray, a number of hybridization techniques and screening methods have been developed and tested.


RESULTS
we have analyzed and evaluated the utility of a microarray containing  <dig>   salmonid cdnas in a variety of potential experimental settings. we quantified the amount of transcriptome binding that occurred in cross-species, organ complexity and intraspecific variation hybridization studies. we also developed a methodology to rapidly identify and confirm the contents of a bacterial artificial chromosome  library containing atlantic salmon genomic dna.


CONCLUSIONS
we validate and demonstrate the usefulness of the 16k microarray over a wide range of teleosts, even for transcriptome targets from species distantly related to salmonids. we show the potential of the use of the microarray in a variety of experimental settings through hybridization studies that examine the binding of targets derived from different organs and tissues. intraspecific variation in transcriptome expression is evaluated and discussed. finally, bac hybridizations are demonstrated as a rapid and accurate means to identify gene content.
