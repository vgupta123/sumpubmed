BACKGROUND
dna microarrays are a powerful tool for monitoring the expression of tens of thousands of genes simultaneously. with the advance of microarray technology, the challenge issue becomes how to analyze a large amount of microarray data and make biological sense of them. affymetrix genechips are widely used microarrays, where a variety of statistical algorithms have been explored and used for detecting significant genes in the experiment. these methods rely solely on the quantitative data, i.e., signal intensity; however, qualitative data are also important parameters in detecting differentially expressed genes.


RESULTS
affyminer is a tool developed for detecting differentially expressed genes in affymetrix genechip microarray data and for associating gene annotation and gene ontology information with the genes detected. affyminer consists of the functional modules, genefinder for detecting significant genes in a treatment versus control experiment and gotree for mapping genes of interest onto the gene ontology  space; and interfaces to run cluster, a program for clustering analysis, and genmapp, a program for pathway analysis. affyminer has been used for analyzing the genechip data and the results were presented in several publications.


CONCLUSIONS
affyminer fills an important gap in finding differentially expressed genes in affymetrix genechip microarray data. affyminer effectively deals with multiple replicates in the experiment and takes into account both quantitative and qualitative data in identifying significant genes. affyminer reduces the time and effort needed to compare data from multiple arrays and to interpret the possible biological implications associated with significant changes in a gene's expression.
