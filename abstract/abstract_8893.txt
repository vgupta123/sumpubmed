BACKGROUND
docking algorithms are developed to predict in which orientation two proteins are likely to bind under natural conditions. the currently used methods usually consist of a sampling step followed by a scoring step. we developed a weighted geometric correlation based on optimised atom specific weighting factors and combined them with our previously published amino acid specific scoring and with a comprehensive svm-based scoring function.


RESULTS
the scoring with the atom specific weighting factors yields better results than the amino acid specific scoring. in combination with svm-based scoring functions the percentage of complexes for which a near native structure can be predicted within the top  <dig> ranks increased from 14% with the geometric scoring to 54% with the combination of all scoring functions. especially for the enzyme-inhibitor complexes the results of the ranking are excellent. for half of these complexes a near-native structure can be predicted within the first  <dig> proposed structures and for more than 86% of all enzyme-inhibitor complexes within the first  <dig> predicted structures.


CONCLUSIONS
we were able to develop a combination of different scoring schemes which considers a series of previously described and some new scoring criteria yielding a remarkable improvement of prediction quality.
