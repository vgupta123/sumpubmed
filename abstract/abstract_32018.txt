BACKGROUND
peste des petits ruminants  is an economically important disease of small ruminants such as sheep and goats. the disease is characterized by severe pyrexia, oculo-nasal discharge, pneumonia, necrosis and ulceration of the mucous membrane and inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract leading to severe diarrhea. a sybr green i based real time rt-pcr targeting the n gene of pprv has not been established for pprv detection. thus, the objective of present study was to develop highly sensitive n gene target sybr green i real time rt-pcr for specific detection and quantification of pprv in clinical samples. a set of primers was designed to detect the nucleocapsid  gene of pprv.


RESULTS
the assay exhibited high specificity as all the viruses which have clinical and structural similarities to pprv including canine distemper virus , measles virus , bluetongue virus  and newcastle disease virus  failed to show an amplification signal. the lower detection limit of the assay was  <dig>  copies/Î¼l  and  <dig>  tcid50/ml  based on plasmid copy number and tissue culture infectivity titre. the assay was 3-log more sensitive than the conventional rt-pcr. the coefficient of variation  values for intra- and inter-assay variability were low, ranging from  <dig> % -  <dig> %, and  <dig> % -  <dig> %, respectively. to evaluate the performance of the newly developed assay, a total of  <dig> clinical samples suspected of ppr were screened for the presence of pprv in parallel with conventional rt-pcr. the real time rt-pcr assay detected pprv in  <dig>  of clinical samples compared to  <dig>  by conventional rt-pcr.


CONCLUSIONS
the two-step sybr green i based real time rt-pcr assay reported here is highly sensitive, specific, reproducible and rapid for detection and quantification of pprv nucleic acids.
