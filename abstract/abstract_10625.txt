BACKGROUND
the role of integrin signaling in mucosal inflammation is presently unknown. hence, we aimed to investigate the role of epithelial-derived integrin-linked kinase , a critical integrin signaling intermediary molecule, in colonic inflammation.

methods
conditional intestinal epithelial cell ilk knockout mice were used for assessment of acute and chronic dextran sodium sulfate  -induced colitis. disease activity was scored using standard histological scoring, mucosal cytokines were measured using elisa, chemokines were determined using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, as well as q-pcr, and intracellular cytokine staining performed using facs analysis.


RESULTS
in both acute and chronic dss-induced colitis, compared to wild-type mice, ilk-ko mice exhibit less weight loss, and have reduced inflammatory scores. in an in vitro model system using hct <dig> cells, we demonstrate that si-rna mediated down-regulation of ilk results in a reduction in monocyte chemoattractant protein  <dig>  chemokine expression. a reduction in ccl <dig> levels is also observed in the tissue lysates of chronically inflamed colons from ilk-ko mice. examination of mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes from ilk-ko mice reveals that there is a reduction in the levels of ifn gamma using intracellular staining, together with an increase in foxp3+ t regulatory cells. immunohistochemistry demonstrates that reduced fibronectin expression characterizes the inflammatory lesions within the colons of ilk-ko mice. intriguingly, we demonstrate that fibronectin is directly capable of downregulating t regulatory cell development.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, the data indicate for the first time that ilk plays a pro-inflammatory role in intestinal inflammation, through effects on chemokine expression, the extracellular matrix and immune tolerance.
