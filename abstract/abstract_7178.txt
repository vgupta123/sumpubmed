BACKGROUND
protein domains are the structural and functional units of proteins. the ability to parse proteins into different domains is important for effective classification, understanding of protein structure, function, and evolution and is hence biologically relevant. several computational methods are available to identify domains in the sequence. domain finding algorithms often employ stringent thresholds to recognize sequence domains. identification of additional domains can be tedious involving intense computation and manual intervention but can lead to better understanding of overall biological function. in this context, the problem of identifying new domains in the unassigned regions of a protein sequence assumes a crucial importance.


RESULTS
we had earlier demonstrated that accumulation of domain information of sequence homologues can substantially aid prediction of new domains. in this paper, we propose a computationally intensive, multi-step bioinformatics protocol as a web server named as pure  for the detailed examination of stretches of unassigned regions in proteins. query sequence is processed using different automated filtering steps based on length, presence of coiled-coil regions, transmembrane regions, homologous sequences and percentage of secondary structure content. later, the filtered sequence segments and their sequence homologues are fed to psi-blast, cd-hit and hmmpfam. data from the various programs are integrated and information regarding the probable domains predicted from the sequence is reported.


CONCLUSIONS
we have implemented pure protocol as a web server for rapid and comprehensive analysis of unassigned regions in the proteins. this server integrates data from different programs and provides information about the domains encoded in the unassigned regions.
