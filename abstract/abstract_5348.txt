BACKGROUND
emergence of multiple drug resistant strains of m. tuberculosis  threatens to derail global efforts aimed at reigning in the pathogen. co-infections of m. tuberculosis with hiv are difficult to treat. to counter these new challenges, it is essential to study the interactions between m. tuberculosis and the host to learn how these bacteria cause disease.


RESULTS
we report a systematic flow to predict the host pathogen interactions  between m. tuberculosis and homo sapiens based on sequence motifs. first, protein sequences were used as initial input for identifying the hpis by ‘interolog’ method. hpis were further filtered by prediction of domain-domain interactions . functional annotations of protein and publicly available experimental results were applied to filter the remaining hpis. using such a strategy,  <dig> pairs of hpis were identified, which involve  <dig> proteins from m. tuberculosis and  <dig> proteins from homo sapiens. a biological interaction network between m. tuberculosis and homo sapiens was then constructed using the predicted inter- and intra-species interactions based on the  <dig> pairs of hpis. finally, a web accessible database named path  was constructed to store these predicted interactions and proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
this interaction network will facilitate the research on host-pathogen protein-protein interactions, and may throw light on how m. tuberculosis interacts with its host.
