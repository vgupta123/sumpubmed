BACKGROUND
activation of amoeboid microglial cells  and its related inflammatory response have been linked to the periventricular white matter damage after hypoxia in neonatal brain. hypoxia increases free atp in the brain and then induces various effects through atp receptors. the present study explored the possible mechanism in atp induced amc activation in hypoxia.


RESULTS
we first examined the immunoexpression of p2x <dig>  p2x <dig> and p2y <dig> in the corpus callosum  and subependyma associated with the lateral ventricles where both areas are rich in amc. among the three purinergic receptors, p2x <dig> was most intensely expressed. by double immunofluorescence, p2x <dig> was specifically localized in amc  but the immunofluorescence in amc was progressively diminished with advancing age . it was further shown that p2x <dig> expression was noticeably enhanced in p <dig> day rats subjected to hypoxia and killed at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> h and  <dig> d versus their matching controls by double labeling and western blotting analysis. p2x <dig> expression was most intense at  <dig> d whence the inflammatory response was drastic after hypoxia. we then studied the association of p2x <dig> with cytokine release in amc after hypoxic exposure. in primary microglial cells exposed to hypoxia, il-1β and tnf-α protein levels were up-regulated. blockade of p2x <dig> receptor with 2', 3'-0- adenosine 5'-triphosphate, a selective p2x1- <dig> blocker resulted in partial suppression of il-1β  and tnf-α expression . however, pyridoxal phosphate-6-azo  tetrasodium salt hydrate, a selective p2x1- <dig>  5- <dig> blocker did not exert any significant effect on the cytokine expression.


CONCLUSIONS
it is concluded that p2x <dig> which is constitutively expressed by amc in postnatal rats was enhanced in hypoxia. hypoxia induced increase in il-1β and tnf-α expression was reversed by 2', 3'-0- adenosine 5'-triphosphate suggesting that p2x <dig> mediates atp induced amc activation and its production of proinflammatory cytokines.
