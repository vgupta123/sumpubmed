BACKGROUND
the advent of genomics-based technologies has revolutionized many fields of biological enquiry. however, chromosome walking or flanking sequence cloning is still a necessary and important procedure to determining gene structure. such methods are used to identify t-dna insertion sites and so are especially relevant for organisms where large t-dna insertion libraries have been created, such as rice and arabidopsis. the currently available methods for flanking sequence cloning, including the popular tail-pcr technique, are relatively laborious and slow.


RESULTS
here, we report a simple and effective fusion primer and nested integrated pcr method  for the identification and cloning of unknown genomic regions flanked known sequences. in brief, a set of universal primers was designed that consisted of various 15- <dig> base arbitrary degenerate oligonucleotides. these arbitrary degenerate primers were fused to the 3' end of an adaptor oligonucleotide which provided a known sequence without degenerate nucleotides, thereby forming the fusion primers . these fusion primers are employed in the first step of an integrated nested pcr strategy which defines the overall fpni-pcr protocol. in order to demonstrate the efficacy of this novel strategy, we have successfully used it to isolate multiple genomic sequences namely,  <dig> orthologs of genes in various species of rosaceace,  <dig> myb genes of rosa rugosa,  <dig> promoters of transcription factors of petunia hybrida, and  <dig> flanking sequences of t-dna insertion sites in transgenic tobacco lines and  <dig> specific genes from sequenced genome of rice and arabidopsis.


CONCLUSIONS
the successful amplification of target products through fpni-pcr verified that this novel strategy is an effective, low cost and simple procedure. furthermore, fpni-pcr represents a more sensitive, rapid and accurate technique than the established tail-pcr and hitail-pcr procedures.
