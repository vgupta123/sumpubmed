BACKGROUND
lack of appropriate tools and techniques to study fate and functional integration of newly generated neurons has so far hindered understanding of neurogenesis' relevance under physiological and pathological conditions. current analyses are either dependent on mitotic labeling, for example brdu-incorporation or retroviral infection, or on the detection of transient immature neuronal markers. here, we report a transgenic mouse model  for time-resolved fate analysis of newly generated neurons. this model is based on the expression of a tamoxifen-inducible cre recombinase under the control of a doublecortin  promoter, which is specific for immature neuronal cells in the cns.


RESULTS
in the dcx-creert <dig> transgenic mice, expression of creert <dig> was restricted to dcx+ cells. in the cns of transgenic embryos and adult dcx-creert <dig> mice, tamoxifen administration caused the transient translocation of creert <dig> to the nucleus, allowing for the recombination of loxp-flanked sequences. in our system, tamoxifen administration at e <dig>  resulted in reporter gene activation throughout the developing cns of transgenic embryos. in the adult cns, neurogenic regions were the primary sites of tamoxifen-induced reporter gene activation. in addition, reporter expression could also be detected outside of neurogenic regions in cells physiologically expressing dcx . four weeks after recombination, the vast majority of reporter-expressing cells were found to co-express neun, revealing the neuronal fate of dcx+ cells upon maturation.


CONCLUSIONS
this first validation demonstrates that our new dcx-creert <dig> transgenic mouse model constitutes a powerful tool to investigate neurogenesis, migration and their long-term fate of neuronal precursors. moreover, it allows for a targeted activation or deletion of specific genes in neuronal precursors and will thereby contribute to unravel the molecular mechanisms controlling neurogenesis.
