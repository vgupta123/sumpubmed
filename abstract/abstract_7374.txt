BACKGROUND
the identification of the routes of dissemination of escherichia coli  o <dig> through a cohort of cattle is a critical step to control this pathogen at farm level. the aim of this study was to identify potential routes of dissemination of e. coli o <dig> using multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeat analysis .


RESULTS
thirty-eight environmental and sixteen cattle faecal isolates, which were detected in four adjacent pens over a four-month period were sub-typed. mlva could separate these isolates into broadly defined clusters consisting of twelve mlva types. strain diversity was observed within pens, individual cattle and the environment.


CONCLUSIONS
application of mlva is a broadly useful and convenient tool when applied to uncover the dissemination of e. coli o <dig> in the environment and in supporting improved on-farm management of this important pathogen. these data identified diverse strain types based on amplification of vntr markers in each case.
