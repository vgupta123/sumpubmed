BACKGROUND
biologically active sequence motifs often have positional preferences with respect to a genomic landmark. for example, many known transcription factor binding sites  occur within an interval  bases upstream of a transcription start site . although some programs for identifying sequence motifs exploit positional information, most of them model it only implicitly and with ad hoc methods, making them unsuitable for general motif searches.


RESULTS
a-glam, a user-friendly computer program for identifying sequence motifs, now incorporates a bayesian model systematically combining sequence and positional information. a-glam's predictions with and without positional information were compared on two human tfbs datasets, each containing sequences corresponding to the interval  bases upstream of a known tss. a rigorous statistical analysis showed that positional information significantly improved the prediction of sequence motifs, and an extensive cross-validation study showed that a-glam's model was robust against mild misspecification of its parameters. as expected, when sequences in the datasets were successively truncated to the intervals ,  and , positional information aided motif prediction less and less, but never hurt it significantly.


CONCLUSIONS
although sequence truncation is a viable strategy when searching for biologically active motifs with a positional preference, a probabilistic model  generally provides a superior and more robust strategy, particularly when the sequence motifs' positional preferences are not well characterized.
