BACKGROUND
a number of studies have separately shown that the neuregulin <dig> /erbb <dig> system and nmda-type glutamate receptors  are involved in several aspects of neuronal migration. in addition, intracellular calcium fluctuations play central roles in neuronal motility. stable expression of the tyrosine kinase receptor erbb <dig> promotes migratory activity in the neural progenitor cell line st14a upon nrg <dig> stimulation. in this work we analyzed the potential interactions between the nrg1/erbb <dig> system and nmdars in the st14a migratory process as well as its calcium dependence.


RESULTS
rt-pcr studies have shown that both native st14a cells , as well as erbb4-transfected cells express low levels of a restricted number of nmdar subunits: nr <dig>  nr2c, nr2d and nr3b. the resulting nmdar would form ca2+ channels characterized by low mg2+-sensitivity and low ca2+-permeability, generating small, long-lasting currents. ca2+-imaging experiments showed slow i increases in 45% of the cells following  <dig> Î¼m nmda stimulation. basal migration of erbb4-transfected st14a cells was unaffected by  <dig> hrs nmda incubation. however, over the same incubation time, nmda was able to significantly enhance nrg1-induced migration. pre-incubation with the intracellular calcium chelator bapta-am reduced both nrg1- and nrg1/nmda-stimulated migration, suggesting the involvement of ca2+ in these processes. nrg <dig> stimulation of erbb4-transfected st14a cells induced a sustained, long-lasting increase in i, in 99% of the cells. these intracellular ca2+ signals could be ascribed to both release from intracellular stores and influx from the extracellular medium trough a mechanism of store-operated calcium entry . short-time co-incubation of nmda and nrg <dig> did not substantially modify the nrg1-induced intracellular calcium signals.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, nrg <dig> stimulation of the erbb <dig> receptor exerts a sustained i increase in st14a neural progenitors; nrg1-induced migration is ca2+-dependent and can be positively modulated by activation of the nmda receptor.
