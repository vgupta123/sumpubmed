BACKGROUND
the biological concept of species stresses the importance of understanding what mechanisms maintain species reproductively isolated from each other. often such mechanisms are divided into premating and postmating, with the latest being the result of either prezygotic or postzygotic isolation barriers. drosophila willistoni quechua and drosophila willistoni willistoni are two subspecies that experience reproductive isolation. when a d. w. quechua female is crossed with a d. w. willistoni male, the hybrid males  are unable to father progeny; however, the reciprocal cross produces fertile hybrids. thus, the mechanism of isolation is unidirectional hybrid male sterility. however, the sterile f1qw males contain large amounts of motile sperm. here we explore whether pre-copulatory or post-copulatory pre-zygotic mechanisms serve as major deterrents in the ability of f1qw males to father progeny.


RESULTS
comparisons of parental and hybrid males copulation durations showed no significant reduction in copulation duration of f1qw males. interrupted copulations of the parental species confirmed that sperm transfer occurs before the minimum copulation duration registered for f1qw males. however, we found that when females mate with f1qw males, sperm is not present inside the female storage organs and that the lack of sperm in storage is due to failure to transfer sperm rather than spillage or active sperm dumping by females.


CONCLUSIONS
sterility of f1qw hybrid males is primarily driven by their inability to transfer sperm during copulation.
