BACKGROUND
pharmacogenomics studies the relationship between genetic variation and the variation in drug response phenotypes. the field is rapidly gaining importance: it promises drugs targeted to particular subpopulations based on genetic background. the pharmacogenomics literature has expanded rapidly, but is dispersed in many journals. it is challenging, therefore, to identify important associations between drugs and molecular entities – particularly genes and gene variants, and thus these critical connections are often lost. text mining techniques can allow us to convert the free-style text to a computable, searchable format in which pharmacogenomic concepts  are identified, and important links between these concepts are recorded. availability of full text articles as input into text mining engines is key, as literature abstracts often do not contain sufficient information to identify these pharmacogenomic associations.


RESULTS
thus, building on a tool called textpresso, we have created the pharmspresso tool to assist in identifying important pharmacogenomic facts in full text articles. pharmspresso parses text to find references to human genes, polymorphisms, drugs and diseases and their relationships. it presents these as a series of marked-up text fragments, in which key concepts are visually highlighted. to evaluate pharmspresso, we used a gold standard of  <dig> human-curated articles. pharmspresso identified 78%, 61%, and 74% of target gene, polymorphism, and drug concepts, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
pharmspresso is a text analysis tool that extracts pharmacogenomic concepts from the literature automatically and thus captures our current understanding of gene-drug interactions in a computable form. we have made pharmspresso available at .
