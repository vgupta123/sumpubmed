BACKGROUND
oceans cover approximately 70% of the earth's surface with an average depth of  <dig> m and a pressure of  <dig> mpa, thus a large part of the biosphere is occupied by high pressure environments. piezophilic  organisms are adapted to deep-sea life and grow optimally at pressures higher than  <dig>  mpa. to better understand high pressure adaptation from a genomic point of view three different photobacterium profundum strains were compared. using the sequenced piezophile p. profundum strain ss <dig> as a reference, microarray technology was used to identify the genomic regions missing in two other strains: a pressure adapted strain  and a pressure-sensitive strain . finally, the transcriptome of ss <dig> grown under different pressure  and temperature  conditions was analyzed taking into consideration the differentially expressed genes belonging to the flexible gene pool.


RESULTS
these studies indicated the presence of a large flexible gene pool in ss <dig> characterized by various horizontally acquired elements. this was verified by extensive analysis of gc content, codon usage and genomic signature of the ss <dig> genome.  <dig> open reading frames  were found to be specifically absent or highly divergent in the piezosensitive strain, but present in the two piezophilic strains. among these genes, six were found to also be up-regulated by high pressure.


CONCLUSIONS
these data provide information on horizontal gene flow in the deep sea, provide additional details of p. profundum genome expression patterns and suggest genes which could perform critical functions for abyssal survival, including perhaps high pressure growth.
