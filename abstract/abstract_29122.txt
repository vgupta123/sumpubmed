BACKGROUND
functional immunoglobulin and t cell receptor genes are produced in developing lymphocytes by vj recombination. the initial site-specific dna cleavage steps in this process are catalyzed by the vj recombinase, consisting of rag <dig> and rag <dig>  which is directed to appropriate dna cleavage sites by recognition of the conserved recombination signal sequence . rag <dig> contains both the active site and the rss binding domains, although rag <dig> is also required for dna cleavage activity. an understanding of the physicochemical properties of the rag proteins, their association, and their interaction with the rss is not yet well developed.


RESULTS
here, we further our investigations into the self-association properties of rag <dig> by demonstrating that despite the presence of multiple rag <dig> oligomers, only the dimeric form maintains the ability to interact with rag <dig> and the rss. however, facile aggregation of the dimeric form at physiological temperature may render this protein inactive in the absence of rag <dig>  upon addition of rag <dig> at 37Â°c, the preferentially stabilized vj recombinase:rss complex contains a single dimer of rag <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
together these results confirm that the functional form of rag <dig> in vj recombination is in the dimeric state, and that its stability under physiological conditions likely requires complex formation with rag <dig>  additionally, in future structural and functional studies of rag <dig>  it will be important to take into account the temperature-dependent self-association properties of rag <dig> described in this study.
