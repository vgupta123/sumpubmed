BACKGROUND
cellular function is regulated by the balance of stringently regulated amounts of mrna. previous reports revealed that rna polymerase ii , which transcribes mrna, can be classified into the pausing state and the active transcription state according to the phosphorylation state of rpb <dig>  the catalytic subunit of rnapii. however, genome-wide association between mrna expression level and the phosphorylation state of rnapii is unclear. while the functional importance of pausing genes is clear, such as in mouse embryonic stem cells for differentiation, understanding this association is critical for distinguishing pausing genes from active transcribing genes in expression profiling data, such as microarrays and rnaseq. therefore, we examined the correlation between the phosphorylation of rnapii and mrna expression levels using a combined analysis by chipseq and rnaseq.


RESULTS
we first performed a precise quantitative measurement of mrna by performing an optimized calculation in rnaseq. we then visualized the recruitment of various phosphorylated rnapiis, such as ser2p and ser5p. a combined analysis using optimized rnaseq and chipseq for phosphorylated rnapii revealed that mrna levels correlate with the various phosphorylation states of rnapii.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that the amount of mrna is precisely reflected by the phased phosphorylation of ser <dig> and ser <dig>  in particular, even the most "pausing" genes, for which only ser <dig> is phosphorylated, were detectable at a certain level of mrna. our analysis indicated that the complexity of quantitative regulation of mrna levels could be classified into three categories according to the phosphorylation state of rnapii.
