BACKGROUND
influenza infection causes respiratory disease that can lead to death. the complex interplay between virus-encoded and host-specific pathogenicity regulators – and the relative contributions of each toward viral pathogenicity – is not well-understood.


RESULTS
by analyzing a collection of lung samples from mice infected by a/vietnam/1203/ <dig> , we characterized a signature of transcripts and proteins associated with the kinetics of the host response. using a new geometrical representation method and two criteria, we show that inoculation concentrations and four specific mutations in vn <dig> mainly impact the magnitude and velocity of the host response kinetics, rather than specific sets of up- and down- regulated genes. we observed analogous kinetic effects using lung samples from mice infected with a/california/04/ <dig> , and we show that these effects correlate with morbidity and viral titer.


CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated the importance of the kinetics of the host response to h5n <dig> pathogenesis and its relationship with clinical disease severity and virus replication. these kinetic properties imply that time-matched comparisons of ‘omics profiles to viral infections give limited views to differentiate host-responses. moreover, these results demonstrate that a fast activation of the host-response at the earliest time points post-infection is critical for protective mechanisms against fast replicating viruses.
