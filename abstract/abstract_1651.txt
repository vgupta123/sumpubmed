BACKGROUND
the lipogenic enzyme fatty acid synthase  is up-regulated in a wide variety of cancers, and is considered a potential metabolic oncogene by virtue of its ability to enhance tumor cell survival. inhibition of tumor fas causes both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, indicating fas is a promising target for cancer treatment.


RESULTS
here, we used gene expression profiling to conduct a global study of the cellular processes affected by sirna mediated knockdown of fas in mda-mb- <dig> mammary carcinoma cells. the study identified  <dig> up-regulated genes  and  <dig> down-regulated genes  in response to knockdown of fas. these genes regulate several aspects of tumor function, including metabolism, cell survival/proliferation, dna replication/transcription, and protein degradation. quantitative pathway analysis using gene set enrichment analysis software further revealed that the most pronounced effect of fas knockdown was down-regulation in pathways that regulate lipid metabolism, glycolysis, the tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. these changes were coupled with up-regulation in genes involved in cell cycle arrest and death receptor mediated apoptotic pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
together these findings reveal a wide network of pathways that are influenced in response to fas knockdown and provide new insight into the role of this enzyme in tumor cell survival and proliferation.
