BACKGROUND
developmental iodine deficiency  leads to inadequate thyroid hormone that impairs learning and memory with an unclear mechanism. here, we show that hippocampal extracellular signal-regulated kinase  and camp response element-binding protein  are implicated in the impaired learning and memory in lactational and adolescent rat hippocampus following developmental id and hypothyroidism.

methods
three developmental rat models were created by administrating dam rats with either iodine-deficient diet or propylthiouracil -added drinking water from gestational day   <dig> till postnatal day   <dig>  then, the total and phorsporylated erk1/ <dig> and total and phorsporylated creb in the hippocampus were detected with western blot on pn <dig>  pn <dig>  pn <dig> and pn <dig> 


RESULTS
the iodine-deficient and hypothyroid pups showed lower serum ft <dig> and ft <dig> levels, smaller body size, and delayed eyes opening. the mean number of surviving cells in the hippocampus of the iodine-deficient and  <dig> ppm ptu-treated rats was significantly reduced compared to controls . iodine-deficient and  <dig> ppm ptu-treatment groups demonstrated significantly lower level of total and phosphorylated erk1/ <dig> and creb than the controls on pn <dig>  pn <dig> and pn <dig> . the reduction of erk1/ <dig> and creb was not reversible with the restoration of serum thyroid hormone concentrations on pn <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
developmental id and hypothyroidism down-regulate hippocampal erk1/ <dig> and creb in lactational and adolescent rats.
