BACKGROUND
in order to optimise the cost-effectiveness of active surveillance to substantiate freedom from disease, a new approach using targeted sampling of farms was developed and applied on the example of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis  and enzootic bovine leucosis  in switzerland. relevant risk factors  for the introduction of ibr and ebl into swiss cattle farms were identified and their relative risks defined based on literature review and expert opinions. a quantitative model based on the scenario tree method was subsequently used to calculate the required sample size of a targeted sampling approach  for a given sensitivity. we compared the sample size with that of a stratified random sample  with regard to efficiency.


RESULTS
the required sample sizes to substantiate disease freedom were  <dig>  farms for ibr and  <dig>  farms for ebl to detect  <dig> % herd prevalence with 99% sensitivity. using conventional srs, the required sample sizes were  <dig>  farms for ibr and  <dig>  for ebl. considering the additional administrative expenses required for the planning of ts, the risk-based approach was still more cost-effective than a srs  due to the considerable reduction in sample size.


CONCLUSIONS
as the model depends on rf selected through literature review and was parameterised with values estimated by experts, it is subject to some degree of uncertainty. nevertheless, this approach provides the veterinary authorities with a promising tool for future cost-effective sampling designs.
