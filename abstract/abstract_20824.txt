BACKGROUND
the wild barley hordeum chilense fulfills some requirements for being a useful tool to investigate the endosperm yellow pigment content  in the triticeae including its diploid constitution, the availability of genetic resources  and, especially, its high seed ypc not silenced in tritordeums . thus, the aim of this work was to test the utility of the h. chilense genome for investigating the ypc in the triticeae.


RESULTS
twelve genes related to endosperm carotenoid content and/or ypc in grasses  were identified, and mapped in h. chilense using rice genes to identify orthologs from barley, wheat, sorghum and maize. macrocolinearity studies revealed that gene positions were in agreement in h. vulgare and h. chilense. additionally, three main regions associated with ypc were identified in chromosomes 2hch, 3hch and 7hch in h. chilense, the former being the most significant one.


CONCLUSIONS
the results obtained are consistent with previous findings in wheat and suggest that ggpps <dig>  zds and hyd <dig> on chromosome 2hch may be considered candidate genes in wheat for further studies in ypc improvement. considering the syntenic location of carotenoid genes in h. chilense, we have concluded that the hch genome may constitute a valuable tool for ypc studies in the triticeae.
