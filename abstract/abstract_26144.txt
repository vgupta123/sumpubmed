BACKGROUND
genomic regions controlling abdominal fatness  were studied in the northeast agricultural university broiler line divergently selected for af. in this study, the chicken 60ksnp chip and extended haplotype homozygosity  test were used to detect genome-wide signatures of af.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> and  <dig> core regions were detected in the lean and fat lines, and  <dig> and  <dig> reached a significant level , respectively. a number of genes in the significant core regions, including rb <dig>  bbs <dig>  maoa, maob, ehbp <dig>  lrp2bp, lrp1b, myo7a, myo9a and prpsap <dig>  were detected. these genes may be important for af deposition in chickens.


CONCLUSIONS
we provide a genome-wide map of selection signatures in the chicken genome, and make a contribution to the better understanding the mechanisms of selection for af content in chickens. the selection for low af in commercial breeding using this information will accelerate the breeding progress.
