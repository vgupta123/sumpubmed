BACKGROUND
the disruption of the bacterial cell wall plays an important part in achieving quantitative extraction of dna from eubacteria essential for accurate analyses of genetic material recovered from environmental samples.


RESULTS
in this work we have tested a dozen commercial bacterial genomic dna extraction methodologies on an average of  <dig>  ×  <dig> ,  <dig>  ×  <dig> , and  <dig>  ×  <dig>  colony forming units  associated with  <dig> cultures  each of brochothrix thermosphacta , shigella sonnei , and escherichia coli o <dig> . we have utilized real-time pcr  quantification with two specific sets of primers associated with the 16s rrna “gene” to determine the number of copies cfu- <dig> by comparing the unknown target dna qpcr results with standards for each primer set. based upon statistical analyses of our results, we determined that the agencourt genfind v <dig>  high pure pcr template prep kit, and omnilyse methods consistently provided the best yield of genomic dna ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig> 16s rdna copies cfu- <dig> for bt, ss, and ec. if one assumes 6– <dig> copies of the 16s rrna gene per genome, between  <dig> and  <dig> genomes per actively dividing cell and ≥  <dig> cells cfu- <dig> for bt  or between  <dig> and  <dig> cells cfu- <dig> for either ss or ec, then the omnilyse procedure provided nearly quantitative extraction of genomic dna from these isolates . the agencourt, high pure, and omnilyse technologies were subsequently assessed using  <dig> additional gram-positive and  <dig> gram-negative foodborne isolates  using a set of “universal” 16s rdna primers.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, the most notable dna extraction method was found to be the omnilyse procedure which is a “bead blender” technology involving high frequency agitation in the presence of zirconium silicate beads.
