BACKGROUND
large animal veterinarians carry drugs in their practice vehicles in storage areas that are not typically refrigerated. the most common upper limits of manufacturers’ storage temperatures for united states -approved non-refrigerated drugs are  <dig> or 30 °c. because ambient temperatures in many locations in the u.s. exceed these temperatures during the summer, we measured storage area temperatures over 4 months in the summer of  <dig> to evaluate the extent to which labeled storage temperatures are exceeded.

methods
a convenience sample of  <dig> vehicles from  <dig> central texas practices and  <dig> vehicles from  <dig> south central nebraska practices was used. temperatures were recorded in one drug storage compartment in each vehicle from may  <dig> – september  <dig>   <dig>  at 15-minute intervals using a self-contained, battery operated temperature recording device.


RESULTS
the highest temperatures recorded in a storage unit were  <dig>  and  <dig>  °c in texas and nebraska, respectively. the mean temperature recorded across all  <dig> storage units was  <dig>  °c, with a mean of  <dig>  °c in nebraska and  <dig>  °c in texas. in nebraska, at least one temperature over 25 °c was recorded on a mean of 111/124 days and a mean of 63 % of total logger readings. in texas, temperatures over 25 °c were recorded on a mean of 123/124 days and a mean of 95 % of total logger readings.


CONCLUSIONS
temperatures in storage units in participating veterinary practice vehicles exceeded labeled drug storage temperatures a significant portion of the summer of  <dig>  more research is needed to determine whether these excursions above the manufacturers’ recommended storage temperatures alter efficacy of stored drugs.
