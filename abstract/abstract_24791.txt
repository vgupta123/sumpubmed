BACKGROUND
in addition to their value as livestock, pigs are susceptible to classical swine fever virus  and can serve as reservoirs for csfv, allowing it to develop into an epizootic. csfv, a pestivirus of the flaviviridae family, has a single-stranded rna genome. recent research has indicated that the human mxa protein inhibits the life cycles of certain rna viruses, such as members of the bunyaviridae family, the flaviviridae family and others.


RESULTS
to produce pigs with antiviral protection against csfv, transgenic pigs expressing human mxa were generated by nuclear transplantation. cells from three mxa transgenic piglets were used to investigate in vitro antiviral activity of mxa aganist csfv, and the results of in vitro indirect immunofluorescence assays, virus titration and real-time pcr indicated that the mxa transgenic pig has an antiviral capacity against csfv.


CONCLUSIONS
transgene with human mxa on pigs is feasible. high levels of mxa expression do inhibit csfv in vitro at early time points post-infection at 60-96dpi.
