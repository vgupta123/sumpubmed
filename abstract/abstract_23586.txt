BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common pathogen in chronic respiratory tract infections. it typically makes a biofilm, which makes treatment of these infections difficult. in this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of n-acetylcysteine  on biofilms produced by p. aeruginosa.


RESULTS
we found that minimum inhibitory concentrations  of nac for most isolates of p. aeruginosa were  <dig> to  <dig> mg/ml, the combination of nac and ciprofloxacin  demonstrated either synergy  or no interaction  against the p. aeruginosa strains. nac at  <dig>  mg/ml could detach mature p. aeruginosa biofilms. disruption was proportional to nac concentrations, and biofilms were completely disrupted at  <dig> mg/ml nac. analysis using comstat software also showed that pao <dig> biofilm biomass decreased and its heterogeneity increased as nac concentration increased. nac and ciprofloxacin showed significant killing of p. aeruginosa in biofilms at  <dig>  mg/ml and >  <dig> mic, respectively . nac-ciprofloxacin combinations consistently decreased viable biofilm-associated bacteria relative to the control; this combination was synergistic at nac of  <dig>  mg/ml and cip at 1/2mic .  extracellular polysaccharides  production by p. aeruginosa also decreased by  <dig> % and  <dig> % at nac concentrations of  <dig>  mg/ml and  <dig> mg/ml.


CONCLUSIONS
nac has anti-bacterial properties against p. aeruginosa and may detach p. aeruginosa biofilms. use of nac may be a new strategy for the treatment of biofilm-associated chronic respiratory infections due to p. aeruginosa, although it would be appropriate to conduct clinical studies to confirm this.
