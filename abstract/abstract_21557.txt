BACKGROUND
distinguishing desired mutants from parental templates and undesired mutants is a problem not well solved in quikchange™ mutagenesis. although dpn i digestion can eliminate methylated parental  dna, the efficiency is not satisfying due to the existence of hemi-methylated dna in the pcr products, which is resistant to dpn i. the present study designed a novel critical annealing temperature -pcr to replace dpn i digestion for more perfect mutant distinguishing, in which part-overlapping primers containing mutation were used to reduce initial concentration of template dna in mutagenic pcr. a tc-pcr with the same mutagenic primers was performed without dpn i digestion. the tc for each pair of the primers was identified by gradient pcr. the relationship between pcr-identified tc and tm of the primers was analyzed and modeled with correlation and regression.


RESULTS
gradient pcr identified a tc for each of  <dig> tested mutagenic primers, which could discriminate mismatched parental molecules and undesired mutants from desired mutants. the pcr-identified tc was correlated to the primer’s tm . thus, in practical applications, the tc can be easily calculated with a regression equation, tc =  <dig>  +  <dig> *tm.


CONCLUSIONS
the new protocol introduced a novel tc-pcr method for mutant screening which can more efficiently and accurately select against parental molecules and undesired mutations in mutagenic sequence segments.
