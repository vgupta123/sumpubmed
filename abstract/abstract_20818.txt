BACKGROUND
the global epidemiology of parasitic helminths and mycobacterial infections display extensive geographical overlap, especially in the rural and urban communities of developing countries. we investigated whether co-infection with the gastrointestinal tract-restricted helminth, trichuris muris, and the intracellular bacterium, mycobacterium bovis  bcg, would alter host immune responses to, or the pathological effect of, either infection.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that both pathogens are capable of negatively affecting local and systemic immune responses towards each other by modifying cytokine phenotypes and by inducing general immune suppression. t. muris infection influenced non-specific and pathogen-specific immunity to m. bovis bcg by down-regulating pulmonary th <dig> and treg responses and inducing systemic th <dig> responses. however, co-infection did not alter mycobacterial multiplication or dissemination and host pulmonary histopathology remained unaffected compared to bcg-only infected mice. interestingly, prior m. bovis bcg infection significantly delayed helminth clearance and increased intestinal crypt cell proliferation in balb/c mice. this was accompanied by a significant reduction in systemic helminth-specific th <dig> and th <dig> cytokine responses and significantly reduced local th <dig> and th <dig> responses in comparison to t. muris-only infected mice.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate that co-infection with pathogens inducing opposing immune phenotypes, can have differential effects on compartmentalized host immune protection to either pathogen. in spite of local and systemic decreases in th <dig> and increases in th <dig> responses co-infected mice clear m. bovis bcg at the same rate as bcg only infected animals, whereas prior mycobacterial infection initiates prolonged worm infestation in parallel to decreased pathogen-specific th <dig> cytokine production.
