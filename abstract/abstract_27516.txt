BACKGROUND

pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenicity island  <dig>  is one of the largest genomic islands of this important opportunistic human pathogen. previous studies have shown that papi- <dig> encodes several putative virulence factors, including a major regulator of biofilm formation and antibiotic-resistance traits. papi- <dig> is horizontally transferable into recipient strains lacking this island via conjugation mediated by the specialized type iv pilus. the papi- <dig> encodes a cluster of ten genes associated with the synthesis and assembly of the type iv pilus. the papi- <dig> acquisition mechanism is currently not well understood.


RESULTS
in this study, we performed a series of conjugation experiments and identified determinants of papi- <dig> acquisition by analyzing transfer efficiency between the donor and a series of mutant recipient strains. our data show that common polysaccharide antigen  lipopolysaccharide , a homopolymer of d-rhamnose, is required for initiating papi- <dig> transfer, suggesting that this structure acts as a receptor for conjugative type iv pilus in recipient strains. these results were substantiated by experimental evidence from papi- <dig> transfer assay experiments, in which outer membrane or lps preparations from well-defined lps mutants were added to the transfer mix to assess the role of p. aeruginosa lps in papi- <dig> transfer and in vitro binding experiments between pilin fusion protein gst-pilv2’ and immobilized lps molecules were performed. our data also showed that p. aeruginosa strains that had already acquired a copy of papi- <dig> were unable to import additional copies of the island, and that such strains produced proportionally lower amounts of cpa lps compared to the strains lacking papi- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that a papi- <dig> exclusion mechanism exists in p. aeruginosa that might serve to regulate the avoidance of uncontrolled expansions of the bacterial genome.
