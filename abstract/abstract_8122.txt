BACKGROUND
mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascades  are involved in cell fate acquisition during development. these kinase modules are associated with scaffold proteins that control their activity. in drosophila, dmp <dig>  that encodes an erk scaffold protein, regulates erk signaling during wing development and contributes to intervein and vein cell differentiation. functional relationships during wing development between a chromatin regulator, the enhancer of trithorax and polycomb corto, erk and its scaffold protein dmp <dig>  are examined here.


RESULTS
genetic interactions show that corto and dmp <dig> act together to antagonize rolled  in the future intervein cells, thus promoting intervein fate. although corto, erk and dmp <dig> are present in both cytoplasmic and nucleus compartments, they interact exclusively in nucleus extracts. furthermore, corto, erk and dmp <dig> co-localize on several sites on polytene chromosomes, suggesting that they regulate gene expression directly on chromatin. finally, corto is phosphorylated. interestingly, its phosphorylation pattern differs between cytoplasm and nucleus and changes upon erk activation.


CONCLUSIONS
our data therefore suggest that the enhancer of trithorax and polycomb corto could participate in regulating vein and intervein genes during wing tissue development in response to erk signaling.
