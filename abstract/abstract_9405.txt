BACKGROUND
the wnt signaling pathway regulates many processes during embryonic development, including axis specification, organogenesis, angiogenesis, and stem cell proliferation. wnt signaling has also been implicated in a number of cancers, bone density maintenance, and neurological conditions during adulthood. while numerous wnts, their cognate receptors of the frizzled and arrow/lrp5/ <dig> families and downstream pathway components have been identified, little is known about the initial events occurring directly after receptor activation.


RESULTS
we show here that wnt proteins are rapidly endocytosed by a clathrin- and dynamin-mediated process. while endocytosis has traditionally been considered a principal mechanism for receptor down-regulation and termination of signaling pathways, we demonstrate that interfering with clathrin-mediated endocytosis actually blocks wnt signaling at the level of Î²-catenin accumulation and target gene expression.


CONCLUSIONS
a necessary component of wnt signaling occurs in a subcellular compartment distinct from the plasma membrane. moreover, as internalized wnts transit partially through the transferrin recycling pathway, it is possible that a "signaling endosome" serves as a nexus for activated wnt pathway components.
