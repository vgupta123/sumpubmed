BACKGROUND
previous studies of individual genes have shown that in a self-enforcing way, dimethylation at histone  <dig> lysine  <dig>  and dna methylation cooperate to maintain a repressive mode of inactive genes. less clear is whether this cooperation is generalized in mammalian genomes, such as mouse genome. here we use epigenomic tools to simultaneously interrogate chromatin modifications and dna methylation in a mouse leukemia cell line, l <dig> 


RESULTS
histone modifications on h3k <dig> and dna methylation in l <dig> were profiled by both global cpg island array and custom mouse promoter array analysis. we used chromatin immunoprecipitation microarray  to examine acetyl-h3k <dig> and dimethyl-h3k <dig>  we found that the relative level of acetyl-h3k <dig> at different chromatin positions has a wider range of distribution than that of dimethyl-h3k <dig>  we then used differential methylation hybridization  and the restriction landmark genome scanning  to analyze the dna methylation status of the same targets investigated by chip-chip. the results of epigenomic profiling, which have been independently confirmed for individual loci, show an inverse relationship between dna methylation and histone acetylation in regulating gene silencing. in contrast to the previous notion, dimethyl-h3k <dig> seems to be less distinct in specifying silencing for the genes tested.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates in l <dig> leukemia cells a diverse relationship between histone modifications and dna methylation in the maintenance of gene silencing. acetyl-h3k <dig> shows an inverse relationship between dna methylation and histone acetylation in regulating gene silencing as expected. however, dimethyl-h3k <dig> seems to be less distinct in relation to promoter methylation. meanwhile, a combination of epigenomic tools is of help in understanding the heterogeneity of epigenetic regulation, which may further our vision accumulated from single-gene studies.
