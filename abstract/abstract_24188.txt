BACKGROUND
hyperplasia of usual type  is a common proliferative lesion associated with a slight elevated risk for subsequent development of breast cancer. cell cycle-related proteins would be helpful to determine the putative role of these markers in the process of mammary carcinogenesis. the aim of this study was to analyze the expression of cell cycle related proteins in hut of breast specimens of patients with and without breast cancer, and compare this expression with areas of invasive carcinomas.


RESULTS
immunohistochemical evaluation was performed using antibodies against cell cycle related proteins er, pr, p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and ki- <dig> in hyperplasia of usual type  in specimens of aesthetic reduction mammaplasty , in specimens of mammaplasty contralateral to breast cancer , and in specimens of invasive mammary carcinomas  presenting hut in the adjacent parenchyma. the results showed that the immunoexpression of er, pr, p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and ki- <dig> was similar in hut from the three different groups. the p <dig> expression in myoepithelial cells showed discontinuous pattern in the majority of hut, different from continuous expression in normal lobules. nuclear expression of p <dig> and p <dig> was frequently higher expressed in imc and very rare in hut. we also found cytoplasmic expression of p <dig> in benign hyperplastic lesions and in neoplastic cells of imc.


CONCLUSIONS
our data failed to demonstrate different expression of cell cycle related proteins in hut from patients with and without breast cancer. however, we found discontinuous expression of p <dig> in myoepithelial cells around hut adjacent to carcinomas and cytoplasmic expression of p <dig> in epithelial cells of hyperplastic foci. further studies are needed to determine how these subgroups relate to molecular abnormalities and cancer risk.
