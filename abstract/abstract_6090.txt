BACKGROUND
the development of second generation sequencing methods has enabled large scale dna variation studies at moderate cost. for the high throughput discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms  in species lacking a sequenced reference genome, we set-up an analysis pipeline based on a short read de novo sequence assembler and a program designed to identify variation within short reads. to illustrate the potential of this technique, we present the results obtained with a randomly sheared, enzymatically generated, 2- <dig> kbp genome fraction of six pooled meleagris gallopavo  individuals.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> million  <dig> bp reads were generated, representing approximately 5-6%  of the turkey genome, with an estimated sequence depth of  <dig>  reads consisting of bases called with less than 1% error probability were selected and assembled into contigs. subsequently, high throughput discovery of nucleotide variation was performed using sequences with more than 90% reliability by using the assembled contigs that were  <dig> bp or longer as the reference sequence. we identified more than  <dig>  snps with a high probability of representing true nucleotide variation in turkeys. increasing the reference genome by adding publicly available turkey bac-end sequences increased the number of snps to over  <dig> . a comparison with the sequenced chicken genome indicated that the assembled turkey contigs were distributed uniformly across the turkey genome. genotyping of a representative sample of  <dig> snps resulted in a snp conversion rate of 95%. the correlation of the minor allele count  and observed minor allele frequency  for the validated snps was  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
we provide an efficient and cost-effective approach for the identification of thousands of high quality snps in species currently lacking a sequenced genome and applied this to turkey. the methodology addresses a random fraction of the genome, resulting in an even distribution of snps across the targeted genome.
