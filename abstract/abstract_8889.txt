BACKGROUND
as an epigenetic regulator, the transcriptional intermediary factor 1β /kap1/trim28) has been linked to gene expression and chromatin remodeling at specific loci by association with members of the heterochromatin protein  <dig>  family and various other chromatin factors. the interaction between tif1β and hp <dig> is crucial for heterochromatin formation and maintenance. the hp1-box, pxvxl, of tif1β is responsible for its interaction with hp <dig>  however, the underlying mechanism of how the interaction is regulated remains poorly understood.


RESULTS
this work demonstrates that tif1β is phosphorylated on ser <dig>  the alteration of which is dynamically associated with cell cycle progression and functionally linked to transcriptional regulation. phosphorylation of tif1β/ser <dig> coincides with the induction of cell cycle gene cyclin a <dig> at the s-phase. interestingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that the promoter of cyclin a <dig> gene is occupied by tif1β and that such occupancy is inversely correlated with ser <dig> phosphorylation. additionally, when hp1β was co-expressed with tif1β/s473a, but not tif1β/s473e, the colocalization of tif1β/s473a and hp1β to the promoters of cdc <dig> and cdc25a was enhanced. non-phosphorylated tif1β/ser <dig> allowed greater tif1β association with the regulatory regions and the consequent repression of these genes. consistent with possible inhibition of tif1β's corepressor function, the phosphorylation of the ser <dig> residue, which is located near the hp1-interacting pxvxl motif, compromised the formation of tif1β-hp <dig> complex. finally, we found that the phosphorylation of tif1β/ser <dig> is mediated by the pkcδ pathway and is closely linked to cell proliferation.


CONCLUSIONS
the modulation of hp1β-tif1β interaction through the phosphorylation/de-phosphorylation of tif1β/ser <dig> may constitute a molecular switch that regulates the expression of particular genes. higher levels of phosphorylated tif1β/ser <dig> may be associated with the expression of key regulatory genes for cell cycle progression and the proliferation of cells.
