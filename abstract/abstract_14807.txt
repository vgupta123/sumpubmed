BACKGROUND
serotyping of o- and h- antigens is a wideley used method for identification of pathogenic strains and clones of escherichia coli. at present,  <dig> o- and  <dig> h-antigens are described for e. coli which occur in different combinations in the strains. the flagellar antigen h <dig> is widely present in e. coli strains of different o-serotypes and pathotypes and we have investigated the genetic relationship between h <dig> encoding flic genes by pcr, nucleotide sequencing and expression studies.


RESULTS
the complete nucleotide sequence of flic genes present in e. coli reference strains u9- <dig>  and p12b  was determined and both were found  <dig> %  identical in their coding sequence. a pcr/rflp protocol was developed for typing of flic-h <dig> strains and  <dig> e. coli strains reacting with h <dig> antiserum were investigated. nucleotide sequencing of complete flic genes of six e. coli strains which were selected based on serum agglutination titers, flic-pcr genotyping and reference data revealed  <dig>  to 100% identity on the amino acid level. the functional expression of flagellin encoded by flic-h <dig> from strain u9- <dig> and from our strain p12b which is an h <dig> expressing variant type was investigated in the e. coli k- <dig> strain jm <dig> which encodes flagellar type h <dig>  the flic recombinant plasmid carrying jm <dig> strains reacted with both h <dig> and h <dig> specific antisera whereas jm <dig> reacted only with the h <dig> antiserum. by immunoelectron microscopy, we could show that the flagella made by the flic-h <dig> recombinant plasmid carrying strain are constituted of h <dig> and h <dig> flagellins which are co-assembled into functional flagella.


CONCLUSIONS
the flagellar serotype h <dig> is encoded by closely related flic genes present in serologically different types of e. coli strainswhich were isolated at different time periods and geographical locations. our expression studies show for the first time, that flagellins of different molecular weigth are functionally expressed and coassembled in the same flagellar filament in e. coli.
