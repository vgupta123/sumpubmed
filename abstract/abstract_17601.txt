BACKGROUND
4-hydroxy-tamoxifen  triggers cre-mediated k-ras removal in  fibroblasts, generating growth-arrested “rasless” mefs which are able to recover their proliferative ability after ectopic expression of ras oncoproteins or constitutively active braf or mek <dig> 


RESULTS
comparison of the transcriptional profiles of rasless fibroblasts with those of mefs lacking only h-ras and n-ras identified a series of differentially expressed mrnas and micrornas specifically linked to the disappearance of k-ras from these cells. the rescue of cell cycle progression in rasless cells by activated braf or mek <dig> resulted in the reversal of most such transcriptional mrna and microrna alterations.

functional analysis of the differentially expressed mrnas uncovered a significant enrichment in the components of pathways regulating cell division, dna/rna processing and response to dna damage. consistent with g1/s blockade, rasless cells displayed repression of a series of cell cycle-related genes, including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, myc and e2f transcription targets, and upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. the profile of differentially expressed micrornas included a specific set of oncomir families and clusters  known for their ability to target a specific set of cellular regulators and checkpoint sensors  able to modulate the interplay between the pro- and anti-proliferative or stress-response pathways that are reversibly altered in rasless cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that the reversible proliferation phenotype of rasless cells is the pleiotropic result of interplay among distinct pro- and anti-proliferative, and stress-response pathways modulated by a regulatory circuitry constituted by a specific set of differentially expressed mrnas and micrornas and preferentially targeting two cross-talking signalling axes: myc-rb-e2f-dependent and cdkns-p53-dependent pathways.
