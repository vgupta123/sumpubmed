BACKGROUND
bacillus methanolicus mga <dig> is a thermophilic, facultative ribulose monophosphate  cycle methylotroph. together with its ability to produce high yields of amino acids, the relevance of this microorganism as a promising candidate for biotechnological applications is evident. the b. methanolicus mga <dig> genome consists of a  <dig> , <dig> nucleotides  circular chromosome, the  <dig>  nt plasmid pbm <dig> and the  <dig>  nt plasmid pbm <dig>   <dig>  protein-coding regions were annotated on the chromosome,  <dig> on pbm <dig> and  <dig> on pbm <dig>  in the present study, the rna-seq approach was used to comprehensively investigate the transcriptome of b. methanolicus mga <dig> in order to improve the genome annotation, identify novel transcripts, analyze conserved sequence motifs involved in gene expression and reveal operon structures. for this aim, two different cdna library preparation methods were applied: one which allows characterization of the whole transcriptome and another which includes enrichment of primary transcript 5′-ends.


RESULTS
analysis of the primary transcriptome data enabled the detection of  <dig>  putative transcription start sites  which were categorized into  <dig>  tsss located in the upstream region  of known protein-coding genes and  <dig> tsss of novel antisense, intragenic, or intergenic transcripts. firstly,  <dig> wrongly annotated translation start sites  were corrected based on primary transcriptome data. further investigation of the identified 5′-utrs resulted in the detailed characterization of their length distribution and the detection of  <dig> hitherto unknown cis-regulatory rna elements. moreover, the exact tsss positions were utilized to define conserved sequence motifs for translation start sites, ribosome binding sites and promoters in b. methanolicus mga <dig>  based on the whole transcriptome data set, novel transcripts, operon structures and mrna abundances were determined. the analysis of the operon structures revealed that almost half of the genes are transcribed monocistronically , whereas  <dig>  genes are organized in  <dig> operons. several of the genes related to methylotrophy had highly abundant transcripts.


CONCLUSIONS
the extensive insights into the transcriptional landscape of b. methanolicus mga <dig>  gained in this study, represent a valuable foundation for further comparative quantitative transcriptome analyses and possibly also for the development of molecular biology tools which at present are very limited for this organism.
