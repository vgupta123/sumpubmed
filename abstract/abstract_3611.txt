BACKGROUND
genomic position  files currently used in next-generation sequencing  studies are always difficult to manipulate due to their huge size and the lack of appropriate tools to properly manage them. the structure of these flat files is based on representing one line per position that has been covered by at least one aligned read, imposing significant restrictions from a computational performance perspective.


RESULTS
pileline implements a flexible command-line toolkit providing specific support to the management, filtering, comparison and annotation of gp files produced by ngs experiments. pileline tools are coded in java and run on both unix  and windows platforms. the set of tools comprising pileline are designed to be memory efficient by performing fast seek on-disk operations over sorted gp files.


CONCLUSIONS
our novel toolbox has been extensively tested taking into consideration performance issues. it is publicly available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pilelinetools under the gnu lgpl license. full documentation including common use cases and guided analysis workflows is available at http://sing.ei.uvigo.es/pileline.
