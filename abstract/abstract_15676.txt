BACKGROUND
xylanase inhibitors have been confirmed to be involved in plant defence. osxip is a xip-type rice xylanase inhibitor, yet its transcriptional regulation remains unknown.


RESULTS
herbivore infestation, wounding and methyl jasmonate  treatment enhanced mrna levels and protein levels of osxip. by analyzing different 5’ deletion mutants of osxip promoter exposed to rice brown planthopper nilaparvata lugens stress, a 562 bp region  was finally identified as the key sequence for the herbivores stress response. using yeast one-hybrid screening, coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, a basic helix-loop-helix protein  and an apetala2/ethylene response factor  transcription factor oserf <dig> directly binding to the 562 bp key sequence to activate the expression of osxip were identified, which is further supported by transient expression assay. moreover, transcriptional analysis revealed that mechanical wounding and treatment with meja resulted in an obvious increase in transcript levels of osbhlh <dig> and oserf <dig> in root and shoot tissues.


CONCLUSIONS
our data shows that two proteins as direct transcriptional activators of osxip responding to stress were identified. these results reveal a coordinated regulatory mechanism of osxip, which may probably be involved in defence responses via a ja-mediated signaling pathway.
