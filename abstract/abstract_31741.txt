BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  has been a cause for great concern to the danish pig industry since it was first diagnosed in  <dig>  the causative agent of prrs is an rna virus which is divided into different genotypes. the clinical signs, as well as its morbidity and mortality, is highly variable between herds and regions. two different genotypes of prrs virus  are found in denmark: type  <dig> and type  <dig>  approximately 40 % of danish swine herds are seropositive for one or both prrsv types. the objective of this study was to describe the temporal trend and spatial distribution of prrsv in danish swine herds from  <dig> to  <dig>  based on type-specific serological tests from the prrs surveillance and control program in denmark using the results stored in the information management system at the national veterinary institute, technical university of denmark .


RESULTS
the average monthly seroprevalence of prrsv type  <dig> was 9 %  in breeding herds, and 20 %  in production herds; prrsv type  <dig> had an average seroprevalence of 3 %  in breeding herds and of 9 %  within production herds. the seroconversion rate followed a similar and consistent pattern, being higher for type  <dig> than for type  <dig> for both prrsv types. regarding the spatiotemporal results, the relative risk distribution maps changed over time as a consequence of the changes in prrsv seroprevalence, suggesting a general decline in the extent of areas with higher relative risk for both type  <dig> and  <dig>  local spatial analysis results demonstrated the existence of statistically significant clusters in areas where the relative risk was higher for both herds.


CONCLUSIONS
prrsv type  <dig> seroprevalence was constantly higher than for prrsv type  <dig> in both herd types. significant spatial clusters were consistently found in denmark, suggesting that prrsv is endemic in these areas. furthermore, relative risk distribution maps revealed different patterns over time as a consequence of the changes in seroprevalence.
