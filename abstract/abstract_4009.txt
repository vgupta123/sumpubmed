BACKGROUND
in the recent years a strong resemblance has been observed between the insect immune system and the mammalian innate immune mechanisms suggesting their common origin. among the insects, only the dipterans  have been widely investigated for their immune responses towards diverse pathogens. in the present study we constructed and analysed the immune transcriptome of the lepidopteran antheraea mylitta, an economically important indian tasar silkmoth with a view to unravel the potential immune-related genes and pathways.


RESULTS
an expressed sequence tag  library was constructed from mrna obtained from fat bodies of a. mylitta larvae that had been challenged by infection with escherichia coli cells. we identified  <dig> unique ests from a total of  <dig> sequences so generated. a third of the transcriptome showed similarity with previously characterized immune-related genes that included both the known and putative immune genes. of the four putative novel defence proteins  annotated by psi-blast three showed similarity to extracellular matrix proteins from vertebrates implicated in innate immunity, while the fourth was similar to, yet distinct from, the anti-microbial protein cecropin. finally, we analysed the expression profiles of  <dig> potential immune-related genes, and the majority of them were induced more prominently with e. coli compared to micrococcus luteus. we also identified several unknown proteins, some of which could have probable immune-related functions based on the results of the prodom analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study has identified many potential immune-related genes in a. mylitta some of which are vertebrate homologues and others are hitherto unreported putative defence proteins. several genes were present as members of gene families, as has also been observed in other insect species.
