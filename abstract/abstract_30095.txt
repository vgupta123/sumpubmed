BACKGROUND
human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig> , the causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome , exhibits very high genetic diversity with different variants or subtypes prevalent in different parts of the world. proper classification of the hiv- <dig> subtypes, displaying differential infectivity, plays a major role in monitoring the epidemic and is also a critical component for effective treatment strategy. the existing methods to classify hiv- <dig> sequence subtypes, based on phylogenetic analysis focusing only on specific genes/regions, have shown inconsistencies as they lack the capability to analyse whole genome variations. several isolates are left unclassified due to unresolved sub-typing. it is apparent that classification of subtypes based on complete genome sequences, rather than sub-genomic regions, is a more robust and comprehensive approach to address genome-wide heterogeneity. however, no simple methodology exists that directly computes hiv- <dig> subtype from the complete genome sequence.


RESULTS
we use chaos game representation  as an approach to identify the distinctive genomic signature associated with the dna sequence organisation in different hiv- <dig> subtypes. we first analysed the effect of nucleotide word lengths  on whole genomes of the hiv- <dig> m group sequences, and found the optimum word length of k =  <dig>  that could classify hiv- <dig> subtypes based on a test sequence set. using the optimised word length, we then showed accurate classification of the hiv- <dig> subtypes from both the reference set sequences and from all available sequences in the database. finally, we applied the approach to cluster the five unclassified hiv- <dig> sequences from africa and europe, and predict their possible subtypes.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose a genomic signature-based approach, using cgr with suitable word length optimisation, which can be applied to classify intra-species variations, and apply it to the complex problem of hiv- <dig> subtype classification. we demonstrate that cgr is a simple and computationally less intensive method that not only accurately segregates the hiv- <dig> subtype and sub-subtypes, but also aid in the classification of the unclassified sequences. we hope that it will be useful in subtype annotation of the newly sequenced hiv- <dig> genomes.
