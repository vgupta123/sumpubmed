BACKGROUND
banana and plantain  comprise an important part of diets for millions of people around the globe. low temperature is one of the key environmental stresses which greatly affects the global banana production. to understand the molecular mechanism of the cold-tolerance in plantain we used rna-seq based comparative transcriptomics analyses for both cold-sensitive banana and cold-tolerant plantain subjected to the cold stress for  <dig>   <dig> and 6 h.


RESULTS
the cold-response genes at early stage are identified and grouped in both species by go analysis. the results show that  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes  are identified for  <dig> and 6 h of cold stress respectively in plantain, while  <dig> and  <dig> degs are identified respectively in banana. go classification analyses show that the majority of degs identified in both banana and plantain belong to  <dig> categories including regulation of transcription, response to stress signal transduction, etc. a similar profile for  <dig> degs was found in both banana and plantain for 6 h of cold stress, suggesting both share some common adaptation processes in response to cold stress. there are  <dig> degs found uniquely in cold-tolerance plantain, which were involved in signal transduction, abiotic stress, copper ion equilibrium, photosynthesis and photorespiration, sugar stimulation, protein modifications etc. twelve early responsive genes including ice <dig> and mybs <dig> were selected and further assessed and confirmed by qpcr in the extended time course experiments , which revealed significant expression difference of key genes in response to cold stress, especially ice <dig> and mybs <dig> between cold-sensitive banana and cold-tolerant plantain.


CONCLUSIONS
we found that the cold-tolerance pathway appears selectively activated by regulation of ice <dig> and mybs <dig> expression in plantain under different stages of cold stress. we conclude that the rapid activation and selective induction of ice <dig> and mybs <dig> cold tolerance pathways in plantain, along with expression of other cold-specific genes, may be one of the main reasons that plantain has higher cold resistance than banana.
