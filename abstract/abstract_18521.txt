BACKGROUND
the role of mycobacteria in the etiology of crohn's disease  has been a contentious subject for many years. recently, our laboratory showed that spontaneous colitis in il-10-/- mice is driven in part by antigens  conserved in mycobacteria. the present study dissects some of the common cellular and molecular mechanism that drive mycobacteria-mediated and spontaneous colitis in il-10-/- mice.


RESULTS
we show that serum from inflammatory bowel disease  patients contain significantly higher levels of mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis-specific igg <dig> and igg <dig> antibodies , serum amyloid a  as well as cxcr <dig> ligands than serum from healthy donors. to study the cellular mechanisms of mycobacteria-associated colitis, pathogen-free il-10-/- mice were given heat-killed or live m. avium paratuberculosis. the numbers of mucosal t cells, neutrophils, nk/nkt cells that expressed tnfα, ifn-γ, and/or cxcl <dig> were significantly higher in mice that received live mycobacteria than other groups. the numbers of mucosal cxcr3+, cxcl9+, cxcl11+ and/or ifn-γ+ dendritic cells  were also significantly higher in m. avium paratuberculosis-challenged mice, than compared to control mice.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study shows that cd and uc patients mount significant mycobacteria-specific igg <dig> > igg <dig> and cxcr <dig> ligand responses. several cellular mechanisms that drive spontaneous colitis also mediate mycobacteria-enhanced colitis in il-10-/- mice. similar to il-10-/- mice under conventional housing, we show that mycobacteria-challenge il-10-/- mice housed under otherwise pathogen-free conditions develop colitis that is driven by cxcr3- and cxcr <dig> ligand-expressing leukocytes, which underscores another important hallmark and molecular mechanism of colitis. together, the data show that mycobacteria-dependent host responses, namely cxcl10+ t cells and nk cells, assist in the recruitment and activation of cxcr3+ and cxcl11+ leukocytes to enhance colitis of susceptible hosts.
