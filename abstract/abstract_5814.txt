BACKGROUND
members of the sox gene family isolated from both vertebrates and invertebrates have been proved to participate in a wide variety of developmental processes, including sex determination and differentiation. among these members, sox <dig> had been considered to exist only in mammals since its discovery, and its exact function remains unclear.


RESULTS
sox <dig> cdna was cloned from the nile tilapia by rt-pcr and race. screening of available genome and est databases and phylogenetic analysis showed that sox <dig> also exists in non-mammalian vertebrates and invertebrates, which was further supported by synteny analyses. tissue expression in human, mouse and tilapia suggested that sox <dig> was probably a gonad-specific gene, which was also supported by the fact that sox <dig> est sequences were obtained from gonads of the animal species. in addition, four alternatively spliced isoforms were isolated from tilapia gonad. their temporal and spatial expression patterns during normal and sex reversed gonadal development were investigated by rt-pcr and in situ hybridization. our data suggest that expressions of sox <dig> isoforms are related to stage and phenotypic-sex, observed in the germ cells of male gonad and in somatic cells of the female gonad.


CONCLUSIONS
sox <dig> is not a gene only existed in mammals, but exists widely throughout the animal kingdom as supported by our bioinformatic, phylogenetic and syntenic analyses. it is very likely that sox <dig> is expressed exclusively in gonads. expression analyses revealed that sox <dig> may be involved in female and male gonadal development at different stages by alternative splicing.
