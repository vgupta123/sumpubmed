BACKGROUND
the genus pseudomonas includes a heterogeneous set of microorganisms that can be isolated from many different niches and nearly  <dig> different strains have been described. the best characterized bacterium is pseudomonas aeruginosa which is the primary agent of opportunistic infection in humans, causing both acute and chronic infections. other species like fluorescens, putida or mosselii have been sporadically isolated from hospitalized patients but their association with the pathology often remains unclear.


RESULTS
this study focuses on the cytotoxicity and inflammatory potential of two strains of pseudomonas mosselii  that were recently isolated from clinical samples of hospitalized patients. the behavior of these bacteria was compared to that of the well-known opportunistic pathogen p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  we found that p. mosselii atcc baa- <dig> and mfy <dig> are cytotoxic towards caco-2/tc <dig> cells, have low invasive capacity, induce secretion of human Î²-defensin  <dig> , alter the epithelial permeability of differentiated cells and damage the f-actin cytoskeleton.


CONCLUSIONS
these data bring new insights into p. mosselii virulence, since this bacterium has often been neglected due to its rare occurrence in hospital.
