BACKGROUND
bananas and plantains  are among the most important crops in the world due to their nutritional and export value. however, banana production has been devastated by fungal infestations caused by fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense , which cannot be effectively prevented or controlled. since there is very little known about the molecular mechanism of foc infections; therefore, we aimed to investigate the transcriptional changes induced by foc in banana roots.


RESULTS
we generated a cdna library from total rna isolated from banana roots infected with foc tropical race  <dig>  at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  we generated over  <dig> million high-quality reads from the cdna library using deep sequencing and assembled  <dig>  distinct gene sequences by de novo assembly and gap-filling. the average distinct gene sequence length was  <dig>  base pairs. a total of  <dig>   unique sequences were annotated and  <dig>  were assigned to specific metabolic pathways using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes database. we used digital gene expression  profiling to investigate the transcriptional changes in the banana root upon foc tr <dig> infection. the expression of genes in the phenylalanine metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism pathways was affected by foc tr <dig> infection.


CONCLUSIONS
the combination of rna-seq and dge analysis provides a powerful method for analyzing the banana root transcriptome and investigating the transcriptional changes during the response of banana genes to foc tr <dig> infection. the assembled banana transcriptome provides an important resource for future investigations about the banana crop as well as the diseases that plague this valuable staple food.
