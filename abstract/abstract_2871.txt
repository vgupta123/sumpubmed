BACKGROUND
helicases play essential roles in many cellular processes including replication, transcription and translation. most helicases translocate along one strand of the duplex while displacing the complementary strand . thus, helicases have directionality. they move along nucleic acids in either the 3'→ 5' or 5'→ 3' direction. the directionality of helicases with low activity or of those that cannot initiate duplex unwinding from a substrate that contains only one single-stranded overhang region is difficult to determine.


RESULTS
an improved assay to determine helicase directionality was developed that uses a substrate containing biotinylated oligonucleotides. as a proof of concept, it was shown that the substrates substantially improve helicase activity and directionality determination for several dna helicases in comparison to more traditional substrates. in addition, a universal substrate that can be used to determine the directionality of both 3'→ 5' and 5'→ 3' helicases was developed.


CONCLUSIONS
it is shown here that the use of a biotin-streptavidin complex as a helicase substrate improves helicase activity and the determination of helicase directionality. the method described is simpler that the currently available techniques.
