BACKGROUND
the aim of this study was to determine if changes in latencies and amplitudes of the major waves of auditory event-related potentials , correlate with memory status of patients with mild cognitive impairment  and conversion to alzheimer's disease .

 <dig> patients with mci  and  <dig> age-matched healthy control  subjects  were studied.  <dig> patients were re-examined after an average period of  <dig> months. during this time period  <dig> patients converted to ad. between-group differences in latency and amplitude of the major aerp waves  were determined. within each group, correlation coefficients  between these characteristics of the different aerp waves were calculated. finally, for patients, ccs were determined among each aerp wave and their age and mmse scores. confirmatory factor analysis  was used to examine the underlying structure of waveforms both in the control and the patient groups.


RESULTS
latencies of all major aerp components were prolonged in patients compared to controls. patients presented with significantly higher n <dig> amplitudes, but no significant differences were observed in p <dig> amplitudes. significant differences between follow-up and baseline measurements were found for p <dig> latency , n <dig> amplitude  and p <dig> amplitude . mmse scores of patients did not correlate with latency or amplitude of the aerp components. moreover, the establishment of a n <dig> latency cut-off value of  <dig> ms resulted in a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 91% in the prediction of mci patients that converted to ad.


CONCLUSIONS
although we were not able to establish significant correlations between latencies and amplitudes of n <dig>  p <dig> and sw and the patients' performance in mmse, which is a psychometric test for classifying patients suffering from mci, our results point out that the disorganization of the aerp waveform in mci patients is a potential basis upon which a neurophysiologic methodology for identifying and "staging" mci can be sought. we also found that delayed n <dig> latency not only identifies memory changes better than the mmse, but also may be a potential predictor of the mci patients who convert to ad.
