BACKGROUND
within eukaryotes there is a complex cascade of rna-based macromolecules that process other rna molecules, especially mrna, trna and rrna. an example is rnase mrp processing ribosomal rna  in ribosome biogenesis. one hypothesis is that this complexity was present early in eukaryotic evolution; an alternative is that an initial simpler network later gained complexity by gene duplication in lineages that led to animals, fungi and plants. recently there has been a rapid increase in support for the complexity-early theory because the vast majority of these rna-processing reactions are found throughout eukaryotes, and thus were likely to be present in the last common ancestor of living eukaryotes, herein called the eukaryotic ancestor.


RESULTS
we present an overview of the rna processing cascade in the eukaryotic ancestor and investigate in particular, rnase mrp which was previously thought to have evolved later in eukaryotes due to its apparent limited distribution in fungi and animals and plants. recent publications, as well as our own genomic searches, find previously unknown rnase mrp rnas, indicating that rnase mrp has a wide distribution in eukaryotes. combining secondary structure and promoter region analysis of rnas for rnase mrp, along with analysis of the target substrate , allows us to discuss this distribution in the light of eukaryotic evolution.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that rnase mrp can now be placed in the rna-processing cascade of the eukaryotic ancestor, highlighting the complexity of rna-processing in early eukaryotes. promoter analyses of mrp-rna suggest that regulation of the critical processes of rrna cleavage can vary, showing that even these key cellular processes  show some species-specific variability. we present our consensus mrp-rna secondary structure as a useful model for further searches.
