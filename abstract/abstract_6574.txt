BACKGROUND
epigenetics is an important layer of transcriptional control necessary for cell-type specific gene regulation. recent studies have shown significant epigenetic patterns associated with developmental stages and diseases. however, previous studies have been mostly limited to focal epigenetic patterns, whereas methods for analyzing large-scale organizations are still lacking.


RESULTS
we developed a hidden markov model  approach for detecting the types and locations of epigenetic domains from multiple histone modifications. we used this method to analyze a published chip-seq dataset of five histone modification marks  in mouse embryonic stem  cells. we identified three types of domains, corresponding to active, non-active, and null states. in total, our three-state hmm identified  <dig> domains in the mouse genome containing  <dig>  genes on average. these domains were validated by a number of criteria. the largest domains correspond to olfactory receptor  gene clusters. each hox gene cluster also forms a separate epigenetic domain. we found that each type of domain is associated with distinct biological functions and structural changes during early cell differentiation.


CONCLUSIONS
the hmm approach successfully detects domains of consistent epigenetic patterns from chip-seq data, providing new insights into the role of epigenetics in long-range gene regulation.
