BACKGROUND
japanese black bears, a large-bodied omnivore, frequently create small gaps in the tree crown during fruit foraging. however, there are no previous reports of black bear-created canopy gaps. to characterize physical canopy disturbance by black bears, we examined a number of parameters, including the species of trees in which canopy gaps were created, gap size, the horizontal and vertical distribution of gaps, and the size of branches broken to create gaps. the size of black bear-created canopy gaps was estimated using data from branches that had been broken and dropped on the ground.


RESULTS
the disturbance regime was characterized by a highly biased distribution of small canopy gaps on ridges, a large total overall gap area, a wide range in gap height relative to canopy height, and diversity in gap size. surprisingly, the annual rate of bear-created canopy gap formation reached  <dig>  m2 ha–1 yr– <dig> on ridges, which were hot spots in terms of black bear activity. this rate was approximately  <dig>  times that of tree-fall gap formation on ridges at this study site. furthermore, this rate was approximately two to three times that of common tree-fall gap formation in japanese forests, as reported in other studies.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that the ecological interaction between black bears and fruit-bearing trees may create a unique light regime, distinct from that created by tree falls, which increases the availability of light resources to plants below the canopy.
