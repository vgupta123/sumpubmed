BACKGROUND
functional comparative genomic analysis of the cellular immunological effects of different anti-inflammatory phytocompounds is considered as a helpful approach to distinguish the complex and specific bioactivities of candidate phytomedicines. using lps-stimulated thp- <dig> monocytes, we characterize here the immunomodulatory activities of three single phytocompounds  and a defined phytocompound mixture extracted from echinacea plant  by focused dna microarray analysis of selected immune-related genes.


RESULTS
shikonin and emodin significantly inhibited the early expression  of approximately  <dig> genes, notably cytokines tnf-α, il-1β and il- <dig>  chemokines ccl <dig> and ccl <dig>  and inflammatory modulators nfatc <dig> and ptgs <dig>  in contrast, neither cytopiloyne nor bf/s+l/ep inhibited the early expression of these  <dig> genes, but rather inhibited most late-stage expression  of another immune gene subset. transpath database key node analysis identified the extracellular signal-regulated kinase  1/ <dig> activation pathway as the putative target of bf/s+l/ep and cytopiloyne. western blot confirmed that delayed inactivation of the erk pathway was indeed demonstrable for these two preparations during the mid-stage  of lps stimulation. we further identified ubiquitin pathway regulators, e6-ap and rad23a, as possible key regulators for emodin and shikonin, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the current focused dna microarray approach rapidly identified important subgenomic differences in the pattern of immune cell-related gene expression in response to specific anti-inflammatory phytocompounds. these molecular targets and deduced networks may be employed as a guide for classifying, monitoring and manipulating the molecular and immunological specificities of different anti-inflammatory phytocompounds in key immune cell systems and for potential pharmacological application.
