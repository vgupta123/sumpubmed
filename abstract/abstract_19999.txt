BACKGROUND
the expression level of cyclin d <dig> plays a vital role in the control of proliferation. this protein is reported to be degraded following phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase  <dig>  on thr- <dig>  we recently showed that phosphorylation of thr- <dig> is responsible for a decline in cyclin d <dig> levels during s phase, an event required for efficient dna synthesis. these studies were undertaken to test the possibility that phosphorylation by gsk <dig> is responsible for the s phase specific decline in cyclin d <dig> levels, and that this event is regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase /akt signaling pathway which controls gsk <dig> 


RESULTS
we found, however, that neither pi3k, akt, gsk <dig>  nor proliferative signaling activity in general is responsible for the s phase decline in cyclin d <dig> levels. in fact, the activity of these signaling kinases does not vary through the cell cycle of proliferating cells. moreover, we found that gsk <dig> activity has little influence over cyclin d <dig> expression levels during any cell cycle phase. inhibition of gsk <dig> activity by sirna, licl, or other chemical inhibitors failed to influence cyclin d <dig> phosphorylation on thr- <dig>  even though licl efficiently blocked phosphorylation of Î²-catenin, a known substrate of gsk <dig>  likewise, the expression of a constitutively active gsk <dig> mutant protein failed to influence cyclin d <dig> phosphorylation or total protein expression level.


CONCLUSIONS
because we were unable to identify any proliferative signaling molecule or pathway which is regulated through the cell cycle, or which is able to influence cyclin d <dig> levels, we conclude that the suppression of cyclin d <dig> levels during s phase is regulated by cell cycle position rather than signaling activity. we propose that this mechanism guarantees the decline in cyclin d <dig> levels during each s phase; and that in so doing it reduces the likelihood that simple over expression of cyclin d <dig> can lead to uncontrolled cell growth.
