BACKGROUND
guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences are capable of folding into an intramolecular four-stranded structure called a g-quadruplex. when found in gene promoter regions, g-quadruplexes can downregulate gene expression, possibly by blocking the transcriptional machinery. here we have used a genome-wide bioinformatic approach to identify putative g-quadruplex sequences  in the plasmodium falciparum genome, along with biophysical techniques to examine the physiological stability of p. falciparum pqs in vitro.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> pqs in the non-telomeric regions of the p. falciparum clone 3d <dig>  interestingly,  <dig> of these pqs occurred in the upstream region of a subset of the p. falciparum var genes . the var gene family encodes pfemp <dig>  the parasite's major variant antigen and adhesin expressed at the surface of infected erythrocytes, that plays a key role in malaria pathogenesis and immune evasion. the ability of the pqs found in the upstream regions of group b var genes  to form stable g-quadruplex structures in vitro was confirmed using 1h nmr, circular dichroism, uv spectroscopy, and thermal denaturation experiments. moreover, the synthetic compound boq <dig> that shows a higher affinity for dna forming quadruplex rather than duplex structures was found to bind with high affinity to the upsb-q.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first demonstration of non-telomeric pqs in the genome of p. falciparum that form stable g-quadruplexes under physiological conditions in vitro. these results allow the generation of a novel hypothesis that the g-quadruplex sequences in the upstream regions of var genes have the potential to play a role in the transcriptional control of this major virulence-associated multi-gene family.
