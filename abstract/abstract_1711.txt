BACKGROUND
plant wrky dna-binding transcription factors are key regulators in certain developmental programs. a number of studies have suggested that wrky genes may mediate seed germination and postgermination growth. however, it is unclear whether wrky genes mediate aba-dependent seed germination and postgermination growth arrest.


RESULTS
to determine directly the role of arabidopsis wrky <dig> transcription factor during aba-dependent seed germination and postgermination growth arrest, we isolated t-dna insertion mutants. two independent t-dna insertion mutants for wrky <dig> were hypersensitive to aba responses only during seed germination and postgermination early growth. wrky <dig> mutants displayed delayed or decreased expression of abi <dig> and abi <dig>  but increased or prolonged expression of em <dig> and em <dig>  wrky <dig> mutants and wild type showed similar levels of expression for mir <dig> and its target genes myb <dig> and myb <dig>  analysis of wrky <dig> expression level in aba-insensitive and aba-deficient mutants abi5- <dig>  abi3- <dig>  aba2- <dig> and aba3- <dig> further indicated that aba-induced wrky <dig> accumulation during germination and postgermination early growth requires abi <dig>  abi <dig>  aba <dig> and aba <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
aba hypersensitivity of the wrky <dig> mutants during seed germination and postgermination early seedling establishment is attributable to elevated mrna levels of abi <dig>  abi <dig> and abi5-induced em <dig> and em <dig> in the mutants. wrky2-mediated aba responses are independent of mir <dig> and its target genes myb <dig> and myb <dig>  abi <dig>  abi <dig>  aba <dig> and aba <dig> are important regulators of the transcripts of wrky <dig> by aba treatment. our results suggest that wrky <dig> transcription factor mediates seed germination and postgermination developmental arrest by aba.
