BACKGROUND
the rna binding protein, dead end , is essential for maintaining viable germ cells in vertebrates. it is also a testicular germ cell tumor susceptibility factor in mice. dnd <dig> has been shown to interact with the 3'-untranslated region  of mrnas such as p <dig> and lats <dig>  binding of dnd <dig> to the 3'-utrs of these transcripts blocks the inhibitory function of micrornas  from these transcripts and in this way dnd <dig> helps maintain p <dig> and lats <dig> protein expression. we found that dnd <dig> is also expressed in embryonic stem  cells. because es cells share similar gene expression patterns as germ cells, we utilized es cells to identify additional candidate mrnas that associate with dnd <dig> 


RESULTS
es cells are readily amenable to genetic modification and easier to culture in vitro compared to germ cells. therefore, for the purpose of our study, we made a genetically modified, stable, human embryonic stem  cell line that expresses hemagluttinin -tagged dnd <dig> in a doxycycline  regulatable manner. this line expresses modest levels of ha-dnd <dig> and serves as a good system to study dnd <dig> function in vitro. we used this stable cell line to identify the transcripts that physically interact with dnd <dig>  by performing ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation  followed by rt-pcr, we identified that transcripts encoding pluripotency factors , cell cycle regulators  and apoptotic factors  are specifically associated with the ha-dnd <dig> ribonucleoprotein complex. surprisingly, in many cases, bioinformatics analysis of the pulled-down transcripts did not reveal the presence of known dnd <dig> interacting motifs.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the inducible es cell line system serves as a suitable in vitro system to identify the mrna targets of dnd <dig>  the rip-rt results hint at the broad spectrum of mrna targets that interact with dnd <dig> in es cells. based on what is known about dnd <dig> function, our results suggest that dnd <dig> may impose another level of translational regulation to modulate expression of critical factors in es cells.
