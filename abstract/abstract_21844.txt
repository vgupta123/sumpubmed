BACKGROUND
although a variety of genetic changes have been implicated in causing phenotypic differences among dogs, the role of copy number variants  and their impact on phenotypic variation is still poorly understood. further, very limited knowledge exists on structural variation in the gray wolf, the ancestor of the dog, or other closely related wild canids. documenting cnvs variation in wild canids is essential to identify ancestral states and variation that may have appeared after domestication.


RESULTS
in this work, we genotyped  <dig>  dog cnvs in  <dig> wolf-like canids  to identify cnvs that may have arisen after domestication. we have found an increase in gc-rich regions close to the breakpoints and around  <dig> kb away from them suggesting that some common motifs might be associated with the formation of cnvs. among the cnv regions that showed the largest differentiation between dogs and wild canids we found  <dig> genes, nine of which are related to two known functions associated with dog domestication; growth  and neurological function .


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide insight into the evolution of structural variation in canines, where recombination is not regulated by prdm <dig> due to the inactivation of this gene. we also identified genes within the most differentiated cnv regions between dogs and wolves, which could reflect selection during the domestication process.
