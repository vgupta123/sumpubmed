BACKGROUND
phenotypic characterization of transgenic cell lines, frequently used in plant biology studies, is complicated because transgene expression in individual cells is often heterogeneous and unstable. to identify the sources and to reduce this heterogeneity, we transformed tobacco  by- <dig> cells with a gene encoding green fluorescent protein  using agrobacterium tumefaciens, and then introduced a simple cloning procedure to generate cell lines derived from the individual transformed cells. expression of the transgene was monitored by analysing gfp fluorescence in the cloned lines and also in lines obtained directly after transformation.


RESULTS
the majority  of suspension culture lines derived from calli that were obtained directly from transformation consisted of cells with various levels of gfp fluorescence. in contrast, nearly 50% of lines generated by cloning cells from the primary heterogeneous suspensions consisted of cells with homogenous gfp fluorescence. the rest of the lines exhibited "permanent heterogeneity" that could not be resolved by cloning. the extent of fluorescence heterogeneity often varied, even among genetically identical clones derived from the primary transformed lines. in contrast, the offspring of subsequent cloning of the cloned lines was uniform, showing gfp fluorescence intensity and heterogeneity that corresponded to the original clone.


CONCLUSIONS
the results demonstrate that, besides genetic heterogeneity detected in some lines, the primary lines often contained a mixture of epigenetically different cells that could be separated by cloning. this indicates that a single integration event frequently results in various heritable expression patterns, which are probably accidental and become stabilized in the offspring of the primary transformed cells early after the integration event. because heterogeneity in transgene expression has proven to be a serious problem, it is highly advisable to use transgenes tagged with a visual marker for by- <dig> transformation. the cloning procedure can be used not only for efficient reduction of expression heterogeneity of such transgenes, but also as a useful tool for studies of transgene expression and other purposes.
