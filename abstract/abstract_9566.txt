BACKGROUND
reporter genes are often used as a selectable marker for generation of recombinant viruses in order to investigate the mechanism of pathogenesis and to obtain candidate vaccine viruses. routine selection of the recombinant parapoxvirus is time-consuming and labor intensive. therefore, developing a novel method for selection is critical.


RESULTS
in this study, we developed a rapid method to generate recombinant orf viruses  based on the enhanced green fluorescent protein  reporter gene as a selectable marker. the coding sequence of egfp gene was amplified from pegfp-n <dig> vector and subcloned into the pzippy-neo/gus plasmid under the control of the early-late vaccinia virus  vv <dig>  promoter and flanked by two multiple cloning sites  to generate a novel transfer vector pspv-egfp. using the pspv-egfp, two recombination cassettes pspv-113lf-egfp-113rf and pspv-116lf-egfp-116rf were constructed by cloning the flanking regions of the orfv <dig> and orfv <dig> and inserted into two mcs flanking the egfp gene. using this novel system, two single gene deletion mutants ov-ia82Δ <dig> and ov-ia82Δ <dig> were successfully generated.


CONCLUSIONS
this approach shortens the time needed to generate recombinant orfvs . thus, the pspv-egfp vector provides a direct, fast, and convenient way to manipulate the recombinant viruses, indicating that it is highly suited for its designed purpose.
