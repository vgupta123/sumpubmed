BACKGROUND
plants produce a wide range of proteinaceous inhibitors to protect themselves against hydrolytic enzymes. recently a novel protein xaip belonging to a new sub-family  was reported to inhibit two structurally unrelated enzymes xylanase gh <dig> and α-amylase gh <dig>  it was shown to inhibit xylanase gh <dig> with greater potency than that of α-amylase gh <dig>  a new form of xaip  that inhibits α-amylase gh <dig> with a greater potency than that of xaip and xylanase gh <dig> with a lower potency than that of xaip, has been identified in the extracts of underground bulbs of scadoxus multiflorus. this kind of occurrence of isoforms of inhibitor proteins is a rare observation and offers new opportunities for understanding the principles of protein engineering by nature.


RESULTS
in order to determine the structural basis of the enhanced potency of xaip-ii against α-amylase gh <dig> and its reduced potency against xylanase gh <dig> as compared to that of xaip, we have purified xaip-ii to homogeneity and obtained its complete amino acid sequence using cloning procedure. it has been crystallized with  <dig>  m ammonium sulphate as the precipitating agent and the three-dimensional structure has been determined at  <dig>  Å resolution. the binding studies of xaip-ii with xylanase gh <dig> and α-amylase gh <dig> have been carried out with surface plasmon resonance .


CONCLUSIONS
the structure determination revealed that xaip-ii adopts the well known tim barrel fold. the xylanase gh <dig> binding site in xaip-ii is formed mainly with loop α3-β <dig>  which has acquired a stereochemically less favorable conformation for binding to xylanase gh <dig> because of the addition of an extra residue, ala <dig> and due to replacements of two important residues, his <dig> and asn <dig> by thr <dig> and ser <dig>  on the other hand, the α-amylase binding site, which consists of α-helices α <dig> , α <dig>  and loop β6-α <dig>  adopts a stereochemically more favorable conformation due to replacements of residues, ser <dig>  gly <dig> and glu <dig> by ala <dig>  ser <dig> and ser <dig> respectively in α-helix α <dig>  glu <dig> and his <dig> by thr <dig> and ser <dig> respectively in α-helix α <dig>  as a result, xaip-ii binds to xylanase gh <dig> less favorably while it interacts more strongly with α-amylase gh <dig> as compared to xaip. these observations correlate well with the values of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m for the dissociation constants of xaip-ii with xylanase gh <dig> and α-amylase gh <dig> respectively and those of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m of xaip with xylanase gh <dig> and α-amylase gh <dig> respectively.
