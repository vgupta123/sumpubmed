BACKGROUND
protein sequence can be obtained through edman degradation, mass spectrometry, or cdna sequencing. high resolution x-ray crystallography can also be used to derive protein sequence information, but faces the difficulty in distinguishing the asp/asn, glu/gln, and val/thr pairs. luffaculin  <dig> is a new type  <dig> ribosome-inactivating protein  isolated from the seeds of luffa acutangula. besides rrna n-glycosidase activity, luffaculin  <dig> also demonstrates activities including inhibiting tumor cells' proliferation and inducing tumor cells' differentiation.


RESULTS
the crystal structure of luffaculin  <dig> was determined at  <dig>  Ã… resolution. its amino-acid sequence was derived from this high resolution structure using the following criteria: 1) high resolution electron density; 2) comparison of electron density between two molecules that exist in the same crystal; 3) evaluation of the chemical environment of residues to break down the sequence assignment ambiguity in residue pairs glu/gln, asp/asn, and val/thr; 4) comparison with sequences of the homologous proteins. using the criteria  <dig> and  <dig>  66% of the residues can be assigned. by incorporating with criterion  <dig>  86% of the residues were assigned, suggesting the effectiveness of chemical environment evaluation in breaking down residue ambiguity. in total, 94% of the luffaculin  <dig> sequence was assigned with high confidence using this improved x-ray sequencing strategy. two n-acetylglucosamine moieties, linked respectively to the residues asn <dig> and asn <dig>  can be identified in the structure. residues tyr <dig>  tyr <dig>  glu <dig> and arg <dig> define the active site of luffaculin  <dig> as an rna n-glycosidase.


CONCLUSIONS
x-ray sequencing method can be effective to derive sequence information of proteins. the evaluation of the chemical environment of residues is a useful method to break down the assignment ambiguity in glu/gln, asp/asn, and val/thr pairs. the sequence and the crystal structure confirm that luffaculin  <dig> is a new type  <dig> rip.
