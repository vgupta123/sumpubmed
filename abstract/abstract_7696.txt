BACKGROUND
the lateral premotor cortex plays a crucial role in visually guided limb movements. it is divided into two main regions, the dorsal  and ventral  areas, which are in turn subdivided into functionally and anatomically distinct rostral  and caudal  sub-regions. we analyzed the callosal inputs to these premotor subdivisions following  <dig> injections of retrograde tracers in eight macaque monkeys. in each monkey, 2â€“ <dig> distinct tracers were injected in different areas allowing direct comparisons of callosal connectivity in the same brain.


RESULTS
based on large injections covering the entire extent of the corresponding pm area, we found that each area is strongly connected with its counterpart in the opposite hemisphere. callosal connectivity with the other premotor areas, the primary motor cortex, prefrontal cortex and somatosensory cortex varied from one area to another. the most extensive callosal inputs terminate in pmd-r and pmd-c, with pmd-r strongly connected with prefrontal cortex. callosal inputs to pmv-c are more extensive than those to pmv-r, whose connections are restricted to its counterpart area. quantitative analysis of labelled cells confirms these general findings, and allows an assessment of the relative strength of callosal inputs.


CONCLUSIONS
pmd-r and pmv-r receive their strongest callosal inputs from their respective counterpart areas, whereas pmd-c and pmv-c receive strong inputs from heterotopic areas as well . finally, pmd-r stands out as the lateral premotor area with the strongest inputs from the prefrontal cortex, and only the pmd-c and pmv-c receive weak callosal inputs from m <dig>
