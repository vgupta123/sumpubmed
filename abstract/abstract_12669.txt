BACKGROUND
genomic analysis of bacteriophages infecting the burkholderia cepacia complex  is an important preliminary step in the development of a phage therapy protocol for these opportunistic pathogens. the objective of this study was to characterize kl <dig>  and ah <dig> , two novel burkholderia cenocepacia-specific siphoviruses isolated from environmental samples.


RESULTS
kl <dig> and ah <dig> exhibit several unique phenotypic similarities: they infect the same b. cenocepacia strains, they require prolonged incubation at 30°c for the formation of plaques at low titres, and they do not form plaques at similar titres following incubation at 37°c. however, despite these similarities, we have determined using whole-genome pyrosequencing that these phages show minimal relatedness to one another. the kl <dig> genome is  <dig>  base pairs  in length and is most closely related to pseudomonas phage  <dig> . in contrast, the ah <dig> genome is  <dig>  bp in length and is most closely related to burkholderia phage bcepnazgul. using both blastp and hhpred analysis, we have identified and analyzed the putative virion morphogenesis, lysis, dna binding, and mazg proteins of these two phages. notably, mazg homologs identified in cyanophages have been predicted to facilitate infection of stationary phase cells and may contribute to the unique plaque phenotype of kl <dig> and ah <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the nearly indistinguishable phenotypes but distinct genomes of kl <dig> and ah <dig> provide further evidence of both vast diversity and convergent evolution in the bcc-specific phage population.
