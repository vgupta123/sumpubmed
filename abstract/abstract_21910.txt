BACKGROUND
diagnostic imaging is essential to assess the lame patient; lesions of the elbow joint have traditionally been evaluated radiographically, however computed tomography  has been suggested as a useful technique to diagnose various elbow pathologies. the primary objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of ct to assess medial coronoid disease , using arthroscopy as gold standard. the secondary objective was to ascertain the radiographic sensitivity and specificity for mcd compared with ct.

methods
for this study  <dig> elbow joints were assessed, of which  <dig> had been examined with radiography, ct and arthroscopy; and  <dig> joints, had radiographic and ct assessment. sensitivity and specificity were calculated for ct and radiographic findings using available statistical software.


RESULTS
sensitivity and specificity of ct using arthroscopy as gold standard resulted in high values for sensitivity  and specificity  for the assessment of mcd. for the radiographic evaluation, a sensitivity of  <dig> % and specificity of  <dig> -  <dig> % using ct as the technique of reference, were found.

discussion
these results suggest that in case of doubt during radiographic assessment, ct could be used as a non-invasive technique to assess the presence of mcd.


CONCLUSIONS
based on the high sensitivity and specificity obtained in this study it has been considered that ct, rather than arthroscopy, is the preferred noninvasive technique to assess mcd lesions of the canine elbow joint.
