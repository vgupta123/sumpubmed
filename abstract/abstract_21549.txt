BACKGROUND
chrysanthemum is an important ornamental plant all over the world. it is easily attacked by aphid, macrosiphoniella sanbourni. the molecular mechanisms of plant defense responses to aphid are only partially understood. here, we investigate the gene expression changes in response to aphid feeding in chrysanthemum leaf by rna-seq technology.


RESULTS
three libraries were generated from pooled leaf tissues of chrysanthemum morifolium ‘nannongxunzhang’ that were collected at different time points with  or without  aphid infestations and mock puncture treatment , and sequenced using an illumina hiseqtm  <dig> platform. a total of  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were obtained in library ck, y and z, respectively. the proportion of clean reads was > <dig> % in each library. approximately  <dig> % of the clean reads were mapped to a reference gene database including all known chrysanthemum unigene sequences.  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes  were identified in the comparison of ck-vs-y, ck-vs-z and z-vs-y, respectively. these degs were involved in phytohormone signaling, cell wall biosynthesis, photosynthesis, reactive oxygen species  pathway and transcription factor regulatory networks, and so on.


CONCLUSIONS
changes in gene expression induced by aphid feeding are shown to be multifaceted. there are various forms of crosstalk between different pathways those genes belonging to, which would allow plants to fine-tune its defense responses.
