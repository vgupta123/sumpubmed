BACKGROUND
watermelon  is an economically important crop with an attractive ripe fruit that has colorful flesh. fruit ripening is a complex, genetically programmed process.


RESULTS
in this study, a comparative transcriptome analysis was performed to identify the regulators and pathways that are involved in the fruit ripening of pale-yellow-flesh cultivated watermelon  and red-flesh cultivated watermelon . we first identified  <dig> novel genes to extend the available reference gene set. second,  <dig> genes in cos and  <dig> genes in lsw <dig> showed at least two-fold variation in expression, and a large number of these differentially expressed genes  during fruit ripening were related to carotenoid biosynthesis, plant hormone pathways, and sugar and cell wall metabolism. third, we noted a correlation between ripening-associated transcripts and metabolites and the key function of these metabolic pathways during fruit ripening.


CONCLUSIONS
the results revealed several ripening-associated actions and provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of watermelon fruit ripening.
