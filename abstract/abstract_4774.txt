BACKGROUND
whole exome sequencing  has been proven to serve as a valuable basis for various applications such as variant calling and copy number variation  analyses. for those analyses the read coverage should be optimally balanced throughout protein coding regions at sufficient read depth. unfortunately, wes is known for its uneven coverage within coding regions due to gc-rich regions or off-target enrichment.


RESULTS
in order to examine the irregularities of wes within genes, we applied agilent sureselectxt exome capture on human samples and sequenced these via illumina in  <dig> ×  <dig> paired-end mode. as we suspected the sequenced insert length to be crucial in the uneven coverage of exome captured samples, we sheared  <dig> genomic dna samples to two different dna insert size lengths, namely  <dig> and  <dig> bp. interestingly, although mean coverages of target regions were clearly higher in samples of  <dig> bp insert length, the level of evenness was more pronounced in  <dig> bp samples. moreover, merging overlapping paired-end reads revealed a positive effect on evenness indicating overlapping reads as another reason for the unevenness.

in addition, mutation analysis on a subset of the samples was performed. in these isogenic subclones, the false negative rate in the  <dig> bp samples was almost double to that in the  <dig> bp samples. visual inspection of the discarded mutation sites exposed low coverages at the sites flanked by high amplitudes of coverage depth.


CONCLUSIONS
producing longer insert reads could be a good strategy to achieve better uniform read coverage in coding regions and hereby enhancing the effective sequencing yield to provide an improved basis for further variant calling and cnv analyses.
