BACKGROUND
brucellosis is one of the most common zoonotic disease affecting humans and animals and is endemic in many parts of the world including the gulf cooperation council region . the aim of this study was to identify the species and determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of brucella strains isolated from clinical specimens, from qatar.


RESULTS
we evaluated  <dig> brucella isolates. all isolates were identified as b. melitensis. all the isolates were susceptible to doxycycline, tetracycline, streptomycin, gentamicin, trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin except rifampicin, where 48 % of the strains showed elevated mics . the rifampicin-resistance related hotspots within the rpob gene were amplified and sequenced using pcr and no rpob mutations were found in strains with rifampicin mics of >2 mg/l.


CONCLUSIONS
this study identified b. melitensis as the etiological agent of brucellosis in qatar. no resistant isolates were detected among conventionally used antimicrobial agents.
