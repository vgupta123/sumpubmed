BACKGROUND
the tgfβ1-induced signal transduction processes involved in growth and differentiation are only partly known. the three-dimensional epithelial differentiation model, in which t <dig> epithelial cells are induced to differentiate either with tgfβ <dig> or imr- <dig> mesenchymal cell-secreted soluble factors, is previously shown to model epithelial cell differentiation seen in intestine. that model has not been used for large scale gene expression studies, such as microarray method. therefore the gene expression changes were studied in undifferentiated and differentiated three-dimensional t <dig> cultures with cdna microarray method in order to study the molecular changes and find new players in epithelial cell differentiation.


RESULTS
the expression of  <dig> genes out of  <dig> arrayed sequences was significantly altered, and  <dig> of them were altered by both mediators. the data were validated and the altered genes are presented in ontology classes. for the genes tested the expressions in protein level were in accordance with the mrna results. we also found  <dig> genes with no known function to be potentially important in epithelial cell differentiation. the mrna expression changes induced by tgfβ <dig> were bigger than changes induced by soluble factors secreted by imr- <dig> mesenchymal cells. the gene expression data was depicted in already known signaling pathway routes.


CONCLUSIONS
our results reveal potential new signaling pathways and several new genes affected by tgfβ in epithelial cell differentiation. the differentiation induced by tgfβ <dig> appears to be more potent than the differentiation induced by mesenchymal cells. this study indicates that our cell culture model is a suitable tool in studying regulatory mechanisms during epithelial cell differentiation in intestine. furthermore the present results indicate that our model is a good tool for finding new players acting in the differentiation of epithelial cells.
