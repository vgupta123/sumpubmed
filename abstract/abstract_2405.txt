BACKGROUND
prediction of protein-protein interaction sites is one of the most challenging and intriguing problems in the field of computational biology. although much progress has been achieved by using various machine learning methods and a variety of available features, the problem is still far from being solved.


RESULTS
in this paper, an ensemble method is proposed, which combines bootstrap resampling technique, svm-based fusion classifiers and weighted voting strategy, to overcome the imbalanced problem and effectively utilize a wide variety of features. we evaluate the ensemble classifier using a dataset extracted from  <dig> polypeptide chains with 10-fold cross validation, and get a auc score of  <dig> , with a sensitivity of  <dig>  and a specificity of  <dig> , which are better than that of the existing methods. to improve the usefulness of the proposed method, two special ensemble classifiers are designed to handle the cases of missing homologues and structural information respectively, and the performance is still encouraging. the robustness of the ensemble method is also evaluated by effectively classifying interaction sites from surface residues as well as from all residues in proteins. moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method to identify interaction sites from the non-structural proteins  of the influenza a virus, which may be utilized as potential drug target sites.


CONCLUSIONS
our experimental results show that the ensemble classifiers are quite effective in predicting protein interaction sites. the sub-enclassifiers with resampling technique can alleviate the imbalanced problem and the combination of sub-enclassifiers with a wide variety of feature groups can significantly improve prediction performance.
