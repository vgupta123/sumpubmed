BACKGROUND
protein-protein interactions  are challenging but attractive targets for small chemical drugs. whole ppis, called the 'interactome', have been emerged in several organisms, including human, based on the recent development of high-throughput screening  technologies. individual ppis have been targeted by small drug-like chemicals , however, interactome data have not been fully utilized for exploring drug targets due to the lack of comprehensive methodology for utilizing these data. here we propose an integrative in silico approach for discovering candidates for drug-targetable ppis in interactome data.


RESULTS
our novel in silico screening system comprises three independent assessment procedures: i) detection of protein domains responsible for ppis, ii) finding sdc-binding pockets on protein surfaces, and iii) evaluating similarities in the assignment of gene ontology  terms between specific partner proteins. we discovered six candidates for drug-targetable ppis by applying our in silico approach to original human ppi data composed of  <dig> binary interactions produced by our hts yeast two-hybrid  assays. among them, we further examined two candidates, rxra/nrip <dig> and cdk2/cdkn1a, with respect to their biological roles, ppi network around each candidate, and tertiary structures of the interacting domains.


CONCLUSIONS
an integrative in silico approach for discovering candidates for drug-targetable ppis was applied to original human ppis data. the system excludes false positive interactions and selects reliable ppis as drug targets. its effectiveness was demonstrated by the discovery of the six promising candidate target ppis. inhibition or stabilization of the two interactions may have potential therapeutic effects against human diseases.
