BACKGROUND
brassica napus  is self-compatible, although its ancestor species brassica rapa  and brassica oleracea  are self-incompatible. most b.napus accessions have dominant self-compatibility  resulting from an insertion of  <dig>  kb in the promoter region of bnscr- <dig> on the a genome, while recessive sc in b.napus has rarely been observed. expression and cloning of srk and scr genes and genetic analysis were carried out to dissect bases of recessive sc in b.napus.


RESULTS
eleven accessions were screened to identify stable recessive sc and had the s genotype bns- <dig> on the a genome and bns- <dig> on the c genome similarly to brs- <dig> and bos- <dig>  respectively. in eight sc accessions, bnscr- <dig> and bnscr- <dig> were nearly undetectable and harbored no structural mutations in the promoters, while srk genes were expressed at normal levels and contained intact cds, with the exception of bnsrk- <dig> in line c <dig>  srk and scr genes were expressed normally but their cdss had no mutations in three sc accessions. in self-incompatible s- <dig> and 11 f <dig> hybrids, srk genes and bnscr- <dig> transcripts were present at high levels, while expression of the bnscr- <dig> and bnscr- <dig> were absent. plants of s genotype s1300s <dig> were completely si, while si phenotypes of sbns-7sbns- <dig> and s1300sbns- <dig> plants were segregated in bc <dig> and f <dig> populations.


CONCLUSIONS
the recessive sc in eight accessions is caused by the loss of function of bnscr- <dig> and bnscr- <dig> in pollen. translational repression contributes to the recessive sc in three accessions, whose srk and scr genes were expressed normally and had identical cdss to brs- <dig> or bos- <dig>  si in 11 f <dig> hybrids relies on the expression of bnscr- <dig> rather than srk genes. other factor independent of the s locus are involved in recessive sc. therefore, diverse causes underlie recessive sc in b. napus, yielding insight into these complex mechanisms.
