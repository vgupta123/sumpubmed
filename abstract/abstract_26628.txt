BACKGROUND
automatic annotation of sequenced eukaryotic genomes integrates a combination of methodologies such as ab-initio methods and alignment of homologous genes and/or proteins. for example, annotation of the zebrafish genome within ensembl relies heavily on available cdna and protein sequences from two distantly related fish species and other vertebrates that have diverged several hundred million years ago. the scarcity of genomic information from other cyprinids provides the impetus to leverage est collections to understand gene structures in this diverse teleost group.


RESULTS
we have generated  <dig>  ests from the differentiating testis of common carp  and clustered them with  <dig>  non-gonadal ests from carpbase as well as  <dig>  ests and  <dig> common carp mrnas from genbank. over 28% of the resulting  <dig>  unique transcripts are exclusively testis-derived ests. moreover,  <dig> of these transcripts did not match any sequence in the zebrafish or fathead minnow est collection.

a total of  <dig>  unique common carp sequences could be stringently mapped to the zebrafish genome , of which  <dig>  matched coding sequences of zebrafish genes with or without potential splice variants. we show that  <dig> common carp transcripts map to intergenic and intronic regions on the zebrafish genome assembly and regions annotated with non-teleost sequences. interestingly, an additional  <dig> common carp transcripts indicate the potential presence of new splicing variants not found in zebrafish databases so far. the fact that common carp transcripts help the identification or confirmation of these coding regions in zebrafish exemplifies the usefulness of sequences from closely related species for the annotation of model genomes.

we also demonstrate that 5' utr sequences of common carp and zebrafish orthologs share a significant level of similarity based on preservation of motif arrangements for as many as  <dig> ab-initio motifs.


CONCLUSIONS
our data show that there is sufficient homology between the transcribed sequences of common carp and zebrafish to warrant an even deeper cyprinid transcriptome comparison. on the other hand, the comparative analysis illustrates the value in utilizing partially sequenced transcriptomes to understand gene structure in this diverse teleost group. we highlight the need for integrated resources to leverage the wealth of fragmented genomic data.
