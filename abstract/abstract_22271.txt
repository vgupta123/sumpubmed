BACKGROUND
insertions and deletions  are the most common form of structural variation in human genome. indels not only contribute to genetic diversity but also cause diseases. therefore assessing indels in human genome has become an interesting topic to the research community. this increasing interest on indel calling research has resulted into the development of a good number of indel calling tools. however, all of these tools are command line based and require expertise from computer science  to execute them which makes it challenging for researchers from non-cs background.

methods
in this paper, we describe an interactive platform named spai which stands for single platform for analyzing indels.


RESULTS
being a graphical user interface  tool, spai facilitates users to run several popular indel calling tools and perform several analyses on the indel calling results without knowing any command line programming.


CONCLUSIONS
spai is written in java and tested in linux operating system.
