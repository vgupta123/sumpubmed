BACKGROUND
aflatoxins are serious hazard to poultry industry and human health. broiler chickens fed on aflatoxin contaminated feed develop various abnormal signs and behavior including less attraction toward feed, abnormal faeces consistency, growth retardation, dirty and ruffled feather, abnormal organs size and weight and blood serum biochemistry. therefore the study was aimed to detoxify aflatoxin b <dig> in poultry feed. in this study a novel adsorbent was prepared from bagasse, characterized in vitro and in vivo it was fed to different groups of poultry birds along with aflatoxin b <dig>  the groups were given arbitrary names a, b, c, d, e and f. group a was fed with normal decontaminated feed, group b was fed with aflatoxin contaminated  feed while the groups c, d, e and f were fed with aflatoxin contaminated  feed plus  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % adsorbent respectively. clinical signs and behavior of the chicks; blood level of alanine transferase, alkaline phosphatase, serum albumen, serum total proteins and serum globulin; mortality; body and organ weights; hemorrhages in organs etc. were monitored in order to study the efficacy of the adsorbent for binding of aflatoxin b <dig> in the gastrointestinal tract of chickens. statistical approach was adopted to analyze the data.


RESULTS
it was found that adsorbent amount  <dig> %/kg feed was highly effective to adsorb and detoxify aflatoxin b <dig> in gastrointestinal tract of broiler chickens and pass safely leaving no harmful effects. however the results of groups e and f fed on  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively showed slight variation in tested parameters from group a.


CONCLUSIONS
the prepared adsorbent was efficient for the detoxification of aflatoxin b <dig> in gastrointestinal tract of chicks and no negative symptoms associated with the use of activated carbon as previously reported were observed for the adsorbent under study.
