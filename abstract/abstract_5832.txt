BACKGROUND
understanding the genetic elements that contribute to key aspects of coffee biology will have an impact on future agronomical improvements for this economically important tree. during the past years, est collections were generated in coffee, opening the possibility to create new tools for functional genomics.


RESULTS
the "puce cafe" project, organized by the scientific consortium nestle/ird/cirad, has developed an oligo-based microarray using  <dig>  unigenes derived from published coffee est sequences mostly obtained from different stages of fruit development and leaves in coffea canephora . hybridizations for two independent experiments served to compare global gene expression profiles in three types of tissue matter  in c. canephora as well as in the leaves of three different coffee species . microarray construction, statistical analyses and validation by q-pcr analysis are presented in this study.


CONCLUSIONS
we have generated the first  <dig> k coffee array during this puce cafe project, granted by g√©noplante . this new tool will help study functional genomics in a wide range of experiments on various plant tissues, such as analyzing bean maturation or resistance to pathogens or drought. furthermore, the use of this array has proven to be valid in different coffee species , drastically enlarging its impact for high-throughput gene expression in the community of coffee research.
