BACKGROUND
selection of a microbial strain for the incorporation into food products requires in vitro and in vivo evaluations. a bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacterium , pediococcus acidilactici kp <dig>  isolated from a traditional dried curd was assessed in vitro for its beneficial properties as a potential probiotic and starter culture. the inhibitory spectra of the bacterial strain against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, its cell surface hydrophobicity and resistance to phenol, its haemolytic, amylolytic and proteolytic activities, ability to produce acid and coagulate milk together with its enzymatic characteristics and adhesion property were all evaluated in vitro.


RESULTS

p. acidilactici kp <dig> was moderately tolerant to phenol and adhere to mammalian epithelial cells . the bacterium also exhibited antimicrobial activity against several gram-positive and gram-negative food-spoilage and food-borne pathogens such as listeria monocytgenes atcc  <dig>  salmonella enterica atcc  <dig>  shigella sonnei atcc  <dig>  klebsiella oxytoca atcc  <dig>  enterobacter cloaca atcc  <dig> and streptococcus pyogenes atcc  <dig>  the absence of haemolytic activity and proteinase  and the presence of a strong peptidase  and esterase-lipase  were observed in this lab strain. p. acidilactici kp <dig> also produced acid, coagulated milk and has demonstrated proteolytic and amylolactic activities.


CONCLUSIONS
the properties exhibited by p. acidilactici kp <dig> suggested its potential application as probiotic and starter culture in the food industry.
