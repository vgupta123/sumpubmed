BACKGROUND
the scorpion tityus stigmurus is widely distributed in northeastern brazil and known to cause severe human envenoming, inducing pain, hyposthesia, edema, erythema, paresthesia, headaches and vomiting. the present study uses a transcriptomic approach to characterize the gene expression profile from the non-stimulated venom gland of tityus stigmurus scorpion.


RESULTS
a cdna library was constructed and  <dig> clones were sequenced and grouped into  <dig> clusters, with one or more ests . forty-one percent of ests belong to recognized toxin-coding sequences, with transcripts encoding antimicrobial toxins  being the most abundant, followed by alfa ktx- like, beta ktx-like, beta natx-like and alfa natx-like. our analysis indicated that 34% of the transcripts encode “other possible venom molecules”, which correspond to anionic peptides, hypothetical secreted peptides, metalloproteinases, cystein-rich peptides and lectins. fifteen percent of ests are similar to cellular transcripts. sequences without good matches corresponded to 11%.


CONCLUSIONS
this investigation provides the first global view of gene expression of the venom gland from tityus stigmurus under resting conditions. this approach enables characterization of a large number of venom gland component molecules, which belong either to known or non yet described types of venom peptides and proteins from the buthidae family.
