BACKGROUND
gene duplication is a major source of new genes that is thought to play an important role in phenotypic innovation. though several mechanisms have been hypothesized to drive the functional evolution and long-term retention of duplicate genes, there are currently no software tools for assessing their genome-wide contributions. thus, the evolutionary mechanisms by which duplicate genes acquire novel functions remain unclear in a number of taxa.


RESULTS
in a recent study, researchers developed a phylogenetic approach that uses gene expression data from two species to classify the mechanisms underlying the retention of duplicate genes . we have implemented their classification method, as well as a more generalized method, in the r package cdrom, enabling users to apply these methods to their data and gain insights into the origin of novel biological functions after gene duplication. the cdrom r package, source code, and user manual for the r package are available for download from cran at https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/cdrom/. additionally, the cdrom r source code, user manual for running cdrom from the source code, and sample dataset used in this manuscript can be accessed at www.personal.psu.edu/rua15/software.html.


CONCLUSIONS
cdrom is the first software package that enables genome-wide classification of the mechanisms driving the long-term retention of duplicate genes. it is user-friendly and flexible, providing researchers with a tool for studying the functional evolution of duplicate genes in a variety of taxa.
