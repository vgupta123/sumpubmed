BACKGROUND
biochar is a solid coproduct of biomass pyrolysis, and soil amended with biochar has been shown to enhance the productivity of various crops and induce systemic plant resistance to fungal pathogens. the aim of this study was to explore the ability of wood biochar to induce resistance to the root-knot nematode  meloidogyne graminicola in rice  and examine its histochemical and molecular impact on plant defense mechanisms.


RESULTS
a  <dig>  % concentration of biochar added to the potting medium of rice was found to be the most effective at reducing nematode development in rice roots, whereas direct toxic effects of biochar exudates on nematode viability, infectivity or development were not observed. the increased plant resistance was associated with biochar-primed h2o <dig> accumulation as well as with the transcriptional enhancement of genes involved in the ethylene  signaling pathway. the increased susceptibility of the ein2b-rnai line, which is deficient in et signaling, further confirmed that biochar-induced priming acts at least partly through et signaling.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that biochar amendments protect rice plants challenged by nematodes. this priming effect partially depends on the et signaling pathway and enhanced h2o <dig> accumulation.
