BACKGROUND
microbial production of nitrogen containing compounds requires a high uptake flux and assimilation of the n-source , which is generally coupled with atp consumption and negatively influences the product yield. in the industrial workhorse saccharomyces cerevisiae, ammonium  uptake is facilitated by ammonium permeases , which transport the nh4
+ ion, resulting in atp expenditure to maintain the intracellular charge balance and ph by proton export using the plasma membrane-bound h+-atpase.


RESULTS
to decrease the atp costs for nitrogen assimilation, the mep genes were removed, resulting in a strain unable to uptake the nh4
+ ion. subsequent analysis revealed that growth of this ∆mep strain was dependent on the extracellular nh <dig> concentrations. metabolomic analysis revealed a significantly higher intracellular nhx concentration  in the ∆mep strain than in the reference strain. further proteomic analysis revealed significant up-regulation of vacuolar proteases and genes involved in various stress responses.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that the uncharged species, nh <dig>  is able to diffuse into the cell. the measured intracellular/extracellular nhx ratios under aerobic nitrogen-limiting conditions were consistent with this hypothesis when nhx compartmentalization was considered. on the other hand, proteomic analysis indicated a more pronounced n-starvation stress response in the ∆mep strain than in the reference strain, which suggests that the lower biomass yield of the ∆mep strain was related to higher turnover rates of biomass components.
