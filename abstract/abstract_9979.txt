BACKGROUND
the analysis of biochemical networks using a logical  description is an important approach in systems biology. recently, new methods have been proposed to analyze large signaling and regulatory networks using this formalism. even though there is a large number of tools to set up models describing biological networks using a biochemical  formalism, however, they do not support logical models.


RESULTS
herein we present a flexible framework for setting up large logical models in a visual manner with the software tool promot. an easily extendible library, promot's inherent modularity and object-oriented concept as well as adaptive visualization techniques provide a versatile environment. both the graphical and the textual description of the logical model can be exported to different formats.


CONCLUSIONS
new features of promot facilitate an efficient set-up of large boolean models of biochemical interaction networks. the modeling environment is flexible; it can easily be adapted to specific requirements, and new extensions can be introduced. promot is freely available from .
