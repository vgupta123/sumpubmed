BACKGROUND
protein functional diversity at the post-transcriptional level is regulated through spliceosome mediated pre-mrna alternative splicing  events and that has been widely demonstrated to be a key player in regulating the functional diversity in plants. identification and analysis of as genes in cereal crop plants are critical for crop improvement and understanding regulatory mechanisms.


RESULTS
we carried out the comparative analyses of the functional landscapes of the as using the consensus assembly of expressed sequence tags and available mrna sequences in four cereal plants. we identified a total of  <dig>  in oryza sativa subspecies  japonica,  <dig>  in o. sativa ssp indica,  <dig>  in sorghum bicolor, and  <dig>  in zea mays as genes. among the identified as events, intron retention remains to be the dominant type accounting for  <dig>  % in s. bicolor, and up to  <dig>  % in o. sativa ssp indica. we identified a total of  <dig> as genes that were conserved among z. mays, s. bicolor, and o. sativa ssp japonica; and  <dig> as genes were found to be conserved among all four studied species or ssp. furthermore, we identified  <dig> as genes conserved with brachypodium distachyon. gene ontology classification of as genes revealed functional assignment of these genes in many biological processes with diverse molecular functions.


CONCLUSIONS
as is common in cereal plants. the as genes identified in four cereal crops in this work provide the foundation for further studying the roles of as in regulation of cereal plant growth and development. the data can be accessed at plant alternative splicing database .
