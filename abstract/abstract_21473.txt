BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus produces several toxins, including panton-valentine leukocidin . the involvement of pvl in primary skin infections, necrotizing pneumonia, musculoskeletal disorders, brain abscess, and other diseases, some of which are life-threatening, has been reported. following expert opinion, we aimed to provide the tools for establishment of sequence-based diagnostics and therapeutics for those conditions. we engineered the synergistic s and f  pro-toxin subunits from staphylococcus aureus usa <dig> into separate expression e. coli bl21-plyss hosts.


RESULTS
following nickel affinity chromatography , the f subunit came out without bands of impurity. the s sub-unit did not come off very pure after nac thus necessitating further purification by size exclusion and ion-exchange chromatography. the purification plots showed that the biologic-lp and akta systems are reliable for following the progress of the chromatographic purification in real-time. computer predicted mw for the 6his-lukf-pv and 6his-luks-pv were  <dig>  da and  <dig>  da respectively, while the mass spectrometry results were  <dig>  da and  <dig>  da respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the biologic-lp and akta systems are commendable for reliability and user-friendliness. as a recent work elsewhere also reported that a second round of chromatography was necessary to purify the s subunit after the first attempt, we speculate that the s subunit might contain yet unidentified motif requiring further treatment. the purified s and f sub-units of pvl were supplied to the nottingham cancer immunotherapy group who used them to establish sequence-based monoclonal antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic uses targeting pvl.
