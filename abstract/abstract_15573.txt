BACKGROUND
due to the limited rna amounts from endomyocardial biopsies  and low expression levels of certain genes, gene expression analyses by conventional real-time rt-pcr are restrained in embs. we applied two preamplification techniques, the taqman® preamp master mix  and a multiplex preamplification following a sequence specific reverse transcription .


RESULTS
t-preamp encompassing  <dig> gene assays with  <dig> cycles resulted in a mean improvement of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ct values. the coefficients for inter-  and intra-assay variation  were low for all gene assays tested . the preamp uniformity values related to the reference gene cdkn1b for  <dig> of the investigated gene assays  were - <dig>  ±  <dig> , without significant differences between self-designed and abi inventoried taqman® gene assays. only two of the tested taqman® abi inventoried gene assays  did not maintain preamp uniformity levels between - <dig>  and + <dig> . in comparison, the ssrt-preamp tested on  <dig> self-designed gene assays yielded higher ct improvement , however was not as robust regarding the maintenance of preamp uniformity related to hprt-ccm , and demonstrated comparable intra-assay cvs , albeit higher inter-assay cvs . comparing embs from each  <dig> patients with dilated cardiomyopathy  and inflammatory cardiomyopathy , t-preamp real-time rt-pcr analyses revealed differential regulation regarding  <dig>  of the investigated  <dig> genes related to both hprt-ccm and cdkn1b. ct values of hprt and cdkn1b did not differ in equal rna amounts from explanted dcm and donor hearts.


CONCLUSIONS
in comparison to the ssrt-preamp, t-preamp enables a relatively simple workflow, and results in a robust preamp of multiple target genes  by a mean ct improvement around  <dig> cycles, and in a lower inter-assay variance in rna derived from embs. preliminary analyses comparing embs from dcm and dcmi patients, revealing differential regulation regarding 30% of the investigated genes, confirm that t-preamp is a suitable tool to perform gene expression analyses in embs, expanding gene expression investigations with the limited rna/cdna amounts derived from embs. cdkn1b, in addition to its function as a reference gene for the calculation of preamp uniformity, might serve as a suitable housekeeping gene for real-time rt-pcr analyses of myocardial tissues.
