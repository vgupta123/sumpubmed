BACKGROUND
plant pathogenic agrobacterium strains can transfer t-dna regions of their ti plasmids to a broad range of eukaryotic hosts, including fungi, in vitro. in the recent decade, the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is used as a model host to reveal important host proteins for the agrobacterium-mediated transformation . further investigation is required to understand the fundamental mechanism of amt, including interaction at the cell surface, to expand the host range, and to develop new tools. in this study, we screened a yeast mutant library for low amt mutant strains by advantage of a chromosome type t-dna, which transfer is efficient and independent on integration into host chromosome.


RESULTS
by the mutant screening, we identified four mutant strains , which showed considerably low amt efficiency. structural analysis of t-dna product replicons in amt colonies of mutants lacking each of the two dna repair genes, srs <dig> and rad <dig>  suggested that the genes act soon after t-dna entry for modification of the chromosomal t-dna to stably maintain them as linear replicons and to circularize certain t-dna simultaneously. the cell wall synthesis regulator smi <dig> might have a role in the cell surface interaction between the donor and recipient cells, but the smi1Δ mutant exhibited pleiotropic effect, i.e. low effector protein transport as well as low amt for the chromosomal t-dna, but relatively high amt for integrative t-dnas. the ergosterol synthesis regulator/enzyme-scaffold gene erg <dig> probably contributes by sensing a congested environment, because growth of erg28Δ strain was unaffected by the presence of donor bacterial cells, while the growth of the wild-type and other mutant yeast strains was suppressed by their presence.


CONCLUSIONS
rad <dig> and the dna helicase/anti-recombinase gene srs <dig> are necessary to form and maintain artificial chromosomes through the amt of chromosomal t-dna. a sterol synthesis scaffold gene erg <dig> is important in the high-efficiency amt, possibly by avoiding congestion. the involvement of the cell wall synthesis regulator smi <dig> remains to be elucidated.
