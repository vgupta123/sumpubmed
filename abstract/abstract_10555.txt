BACKGROUND
colorectal cancer  is a disease of complex aetiology, with much of the expected inherited risk being due to several common low risk variants. genome-wide association studies  have identified  <dig> crc risk variants. nevertheless, these have only been able to explain part of the missing heritability. moreover, these signals have only been inspected in populations of northern european origin.


RESULTS
thus, we followed the same approach in a spanish cohort of  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls. sixty-four variants at  <dig> loci were found to be associated with crc at p-values <10- <dig>  we therefore evaluated the  <dig> loci in another spanish replication cohort . two of these snps, rs <dig> at 1p <dig> = <dig> ) and rs <dig> at 8p <dig> = <dig> ) were replicated in the second phase, although they did not reach genome-wide statistical significance.


CONCLUSIONS
we have performed the first crc gwas in a southern european population and by these means we were able to identify two new susceptibility variants at 1p <dig> and 8p <dig> loci. these two snps are located near the slc5a <dig> and dusp <dig> loci, respectively, which could be good functional candidates for the association signals. we therefore believe that these two markers constitute good candidates for crc susceptibility loci and should be further evaluated in other larger datasets. moreover, we highlight that were these two snps true susceptibility variants, they would constitute a decrease in the crc missing heritability fraction.
