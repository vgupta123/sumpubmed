BACKGROUND
non-small cell lung cancer  remains lethal despite the development of numerous drug therapy technologies. about 85% to 90% of lung cancers are nsclc and the 5-year survival rate is at best still below 50%. thus, it is important to find drugable target genes for nsclc to develop an effective therapy for nsclc.


RESULTS
integrated analysis of publically available gene expression and promoter methylation patterns of two highly aggressive nsclc cell lines generated by in vivo selection was performed. we selected eleven critical genes that may mediate metastasis using recently proposed principal component analysis based unsupervised feature extraction. the eleven selected genes were significantly related to cancer diagnosis. the tertiary protein structure of the selected genes was inferred by full automatic modeling system, a profile-based protein structure inference software, to determine protein functions and to specify genes that could be potential drug targets.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified eleven potentially critical genes that may mediate nsclc metastasis using bioinformatic analysis of publically available data sets. these genes are potential target genes for the therapy of nsclc. among the eleven genes, tinagl <dig> and b3galnt <dig> are possible candidates for drug compounds that inhibit their gene expression.
