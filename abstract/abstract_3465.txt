BACKGROUND
fungal laccase has profound applications in different fields of biotechnology due to its broad specificity and high redox potential. any successful application of the enzyme requires large scale production. as laccase production is highly dependent on medium components and cultural conditions, optimization of the same is essential for efficient product production.


RESULTS
production of laccase by fungal strain marasmiellus palmivorus la <dig> under solid state fermentation was optimized by the taguchi design of experiments  methodology. an orthogonal array  was designed using qualitek- <dig> software to study the interactions and relative influence of the seven selected factors by one factor at a time approach. the optimum condition formulated was temperature , ph , galactose , cupric sulphate , inoculum concentration   and substrate length . overall yield increase of  <dig>  fold was obtained after optimization. statistical optimization leads to the elimination of an insignificant medium component ammonium dihydrogen phosphate from the process and contributes to a  <dig>  fold increase in enzyme production. a final production of  <dig>  ± 13 iu/ml laccase activity paves way for the application of this strain for industrial applications.


CONCLUSIONS
study optimized lignin degrading laccases from marasmiellus palmivorus la <dig>  this laccases can thus be used for further applications in different scales of production after analyzing the properties of the enzyme. study also confirmed the use of taguchi method for optimizations of product production.
