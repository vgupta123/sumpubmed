BACKGROUND
accurate knowledge of the core components of substitution rates is of vital importance to understand genome evolution and dynamics. by performing a single-genome and direct analysis of  <dig>  retrotransposon remnants, we reveal sequence context-dependent germline nucleotide substitution rates for the human genome.


RESULTS
the rates are characterised through rate constants in a time-domain, and are made available through a dedicated program  and a stand-alone database. due to the nature of the method design and the imposed stringency criteria, we expect our rate constants to be good estimates for the rates of spontaneous mutations. benefiting from such data, we study the short-range nucleotide  organisation and the germline basal substitution propensity  profile of the human genome; characterise novel, cpg-independent, substitution prone and resistant motifs; confirm a decreased tendency of moieties with low bsp to undergo somatic mutations in a number of cancer types; and, produce a trek-based estimate of the overall mutation rate in human.


CONCLUSIONS
the extended set of rate constants we report may enrich our resources and help advance our understanding of genome dynamics and evolution, with possible implications for the role of spontaneous mutations in the emergence of pathological genotypes and neutral evolution of proteomes.
