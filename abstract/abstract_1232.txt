BACKGROUND
our current knowledge of tooth development derives mainly from studies in mice, which have only one set of non-replaced teeth, compared with the diphyodont dentition in humans. the miniature pig is also diphyodont, making it a valuable alternative model for understanding human tooth development and replacement. however, little is known about gene expression and function during swine odontogenesis. the goal of this study is to undertake the survey of differential gene expression profiling and functional network analysis during morphogenesis of diphyodont dentition in miniature pigs. the identification of genes related to diphyodont development should lead to a better understanding of morphogenetic patterns and the mechanisms of diphyodont replacement in large animal models and humans.


RESULTS
the temporal gene expression profiles during early diphyodont development in miniature pigs were detected with the affymetrix porcine genechip. the gene expression data were further evaluated by anova as well as pathway and stc analyses. a total of  <dig>  genes were detected with differential expression. several signal pathways and  <dig> genes were then identified through the construction of pathway and signal networks.


CONCLUSIONS
the gene expression profiles indicated that spatio-temporal down-regulation patterns of gene expression were predominant; while, both dynamic activation and inhibition of pathways occurred during the morphogenesis of diphyodont dentition. our study offers a mechanistic framework for understanding dynamic gene regulation of early diphyodont development and provides a molecular basis for studying teeth development, replacement, and regeneration in miniature pigs.
