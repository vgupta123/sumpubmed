BACKGROUND
barley  seed development is a highly regulated process with fine-tuned interaction of various tissues controlling distinct physiological events during prestorage, storage and dessication phase. as potential regulators involved within this process we studied  <dig> transcription factors and  <dig> kinases for their expression behaviour and anchored a subset of them to the barley linkage map to promote marker-assisted studies on barley grains.


RESULTS
by a hierachical clustering of the expression profiles of  <dig> potential regulatory genes expressed in  <dig> different tissues, we found  <dig> regulators preferentially expressed in one of the three grain tissue fractions pericarp, endosperm and embryo during seed development. in addition,  <dig> regulators found to be expressed during both seed development and germination and  <dig> additional regulators are characteristically expressed in multiple tissues undergoing cell differentiation events during barley plant ontogeny. another  <dig> regulators were, beside in the developing seed, ubiquitously expressed among all tissues of germinating seedlings as well as in reproductive tissues. snp-marker development for those regulators resulted in anchoring  <dig> markers on the genetic linkage map of barley and the chromosomal assignment of another  <dig> loci by using wheat-barley addition lines. the snp frequency ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  snp/kb in the parents of the various mapping populations and was  <dig>  snp/kb over all eight lines tested. exploration of macrosynteny to rice revealed that the chromosomal orders of the mapped putative regulatory factors were predominantly conserved during evolution.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified expression patterns of major transcription factors and signaling related genes expressed during barley ontogeny and further assigned possible functions based on likely orthologs functionally well characterized in model plant species. the combined linkage map and reference expression map of regulators defined in the present study offers the possibility of further directed research of the functional role of regulators during seed development in barley.
