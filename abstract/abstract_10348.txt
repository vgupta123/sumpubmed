BACKGROUND
dengue virus  still poses a global public health threat, and no vaccine or antiviral therapy is currently available. antibody plays distinct roles in controlling denv infections. neutralizing antibody is protective against denv infection, whereas sub-neutralizing concentration of antibody can increase denv infection, termed antibody-dependent enhancement . plaque-based assay represents the most widely accepted method measuring neutralizing or enhancing antibodies.


RESULTS
in this study, a novel reporter virus-based system was developed for measuring neutralization and ade activity. a stable renilla luciferase reporter denv  that can produce robust luciferase signals in bhk- <dig> and k <dig> cells were used to establish the assay and validated against traditional plaque-based assay. luciferase value analysis using various known denv-specific monoclonal antibodies showed good repeatability and a well linear correlation with conventional plaque-based assays. the newly developed assay was finally validated with clinical samples from infected animals and individuals.


CONCLUSIONS
this reporter virus-based assay for neutralizing and enhancing antibody evaluation is rapid, lower cost, and high throughput, and will be helpful for laboratory detection and epidemiological investigation for denv antibodies.
