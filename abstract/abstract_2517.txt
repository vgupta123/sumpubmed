BACKGROUND
conception is a fundamental trait for successful cattle reproduction. however, conception rates in japanese black cattle have been gradually declining over the last two decades. although conception failures are mainly caused by embryonic mortality, the role of maternal genetic factors in the process remains unknown. copy number variation , defined as large-scale genomic structural variants, contributes to several genetic disorders. to identify cnv associated with embryonic mortality in japanese black cattle, we evaluated embryonic mortality as a categorical trait with a threshold model and conducted a genome-wide cnv association study for embryonic mortality using  <dig> animals.


RESULTS
we identified a deleted-type cnv ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp on bovine chromosome  <dig>  which was associated with embryonic mortality at 30– <dig> days after artificial insemination . the cnv harbors exon  <dig> to  <dig> of annexin a <dig> . analysis of sequence traces from the cnv identified that 63 bp reads bridging the breakpoint were present on both sides of the cnv, indicating that the cnv was generated by non-allelic homologous recombination using the 63 bp homologous sequences. western blot analysis showed that the cnv results in a null allele of anxa <dig>  this association was replicated using a sample population size of  <dig> animals. to elucidate the function of anxa <dig> in vivo, we generated anxa <dig> null mice using the crispr/cas <dig> system. crossbreeding experiments showed that litter size from crosses of both anxa10
-/- and anxa10
+/- females had fewer pups than did anxa10
+/+ females, and embryos of anxa10
-/- females died between implantation stages e <dig>  and e <dig> . these results indicate that loss of maternal anxa <dig> causes embryonic mortality.


CONCLUSIONS
this study identified a deleted-type cnv encompassing anxa <dig> in cows that was associated with embryonic mortality at 30– <dig> days after ai. using a mouse model, we confirmed that litter sizes were smaller in crosses of both anxa10
-/- and anxa10
+/- females relative to those of wild females. these results indicate that anxa <dig> is a maternal factor that is critical for embryo development.
