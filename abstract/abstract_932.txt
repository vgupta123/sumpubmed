BACKGROUND
accurate evaluation and modelling of residue-residue interactions within and between proteins is a key aspect of computational structure prediction including homology modelling, protein-protein docking, refinement of low-resolution structures, and computational protein design.


RESULTS
here we introduce a method for accurate protein structure modelling and evaluation based on a novel 4-distance description of residue-residue interaction geometry. statistical 4-distance preferences were extracted from high-resolution protein structures and were used as a basis for a knowledge-based potential, called hunter. we demonstrate that 4-distance description of side chain interactions can be used reliably to discriminate the native structure from a set of decoys. hunter ranked the native structure as the top one in  <dig> out of  <dig> high-resolution decoy sets, in  <dig> out of  <dig> "decoys 'r' us" decoy sets and in  <dig> out of  <dig> high-resolution casp7/ <dig> decoy sets. the same concept was applied to side chain modelling in protein structures. on a set of very high-resolution protein structures the average rmsd was  <dig>  Å for all residues and  <dig>  Å for buried residues, which is in the range of attainable accuracy for a model. finally, we show that hunter performs as good or better than other top methods in homology modelling based on results from the casp <dig> experiment. the supporting web site http://bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/hunter/ was developed to enable the use of hunter and for visualization and interactive exploration of 4-distance distributions.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that hunter can be used as a tool for evaluation and for accurate modelling of residue-residue interactions in protein structures. the same methodology is applicable to other areas involving high-resolution modelling of biomolecules.
