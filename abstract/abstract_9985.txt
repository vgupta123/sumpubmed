BACKGROUND
recently, several high-resolution methods of chromosome analysis have been developed. it is important to compare these methods and to select reliable combinations of techniques to analyze complex chromosomal rearrangements in tumours. in this study we have compared array-cgh  and multipoint fish  for their ability to characterize complex rearrangements on human chromosome  <dig>  in tumour cell lines. we have used  <dig> bac/pac clones covering chr <dig> with an approximately  <dig> mb resolution to analyze nine carcinoma lines. chr <dig> was chosen for analysis, because of its frequent rearrangements in human solid tumours.


RESULTS
the ploidy of the tumour cell lines ranged from near-diploid to near-pentaploid. chr <dig> locus copy number was assessed by interphase and metaphase mpfish. totally  <dig> chr <dig> fragments were identified having copy numbers from  <dig> to  <dig>  mpfish results from the bac/pac clones and array-cgh gave mainly corresponding results. each copy number change on the array profile could be related to a specific chromosome aberration detected by metaphase mpfish. the analysis of the correlation between real copy number from mpfish and the average normalized inter-locus fluorescence ratio  value detected by array-cgh demonstrated that copy number is a linear function of parameters that include the variable, anilfr, and two constants, ploidy and background normalized fluorescence ratio.


CONCLUSIONS
in most cases, the changes in copy number seen on array-cgh profiles reflected cumulative chromosome rearrangements. most of them stemmed from unbalanced translocations. although our chr <dig> bac/pac array could identify single copy number changes even in pentaploid cells, mpfish provided a more accurate analysis in the dissection of complex karyotypes at high ploidy levels.
