BACKGROUND
quality control  analysis is an important component in maize breeding and seed systems. genotyping by next-generation sequencing  is an emerging method of snp genotyping, which is being increasingly adopted for discovery applications, but its suitability for qc analysis has not been explored. the objectives of our study were 1) to evaluate the level of genetic purity and identity among two to nine seed sources of  <dig> inbred lines using  <dig> kompetitive allele specific pcr  and  <dig>  gbs markers, and 2) compare the correlation between the kasp-based low and the gbs-based high marker density on qc analysis.


RESULTS
genetic purity within each seed source varied from  <dig> to 100 % for kasp and from  <dig> to 100 % for gbs. all except one of the inbred lines obtained from cimmyt showed  <dig> to 100 % homogeneity irrespective of the marker type. on the contrary, only  <dig> and 21 % of the samples obtained from eiar and partners showed ≥95 % purity for kasp and gbs, respectively. the genetic distance among multiple sources of the same line designation varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for kasp and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for gbs. five lines from cimmyt showed ≤  <dig>  distance among multiple sources of the same line designation; the remaining eleven inbred lines, including two from cimmyt and nine from ethiopia showed higher than expected genetic distances for two or more seed sources. the correlation between the  <dig> kasp and  <dig>  gbs markers was  <dig>  for purity and  <dig>  for identity. a reduction in the number of gbs markers to  <dig>  decreased the correlation coefficient only by  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
our results clearly showed high discrepancy both in genetic purity and identity by the origin of the seed sources  irrespective of the type of genotyping platform and number of markers used for analyses. although there were some numerical differences between kasp and gbs, the overall conclusions reached from both methods was basically similar, which clearly suggests that smaller subset of preselected and high quality markers are sufficient for qc analysis that can easily be done using low marker density genotyping platforms, such as kasp. results from this study would be highly relevant for plant breeders and seed system specialists.
