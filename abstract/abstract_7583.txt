BACKGROUND
leanchoilia superlata is one of the best known arthropods from the middle cambrian burgess shale of british columbia. here we re-describe the morphology of l. superlata and discuss its possible autecology. the re-description follows a standardized scheme, the descriptive matrix approach, designed to provide a template for descriptions of other megacheiran species.


RESULTS
our findings differ in several respects from previous interpretations. examples include a more slender body; a possible hypostome; a small specialised second appendage, bringing the number of pairs of head appendages to four; a further sub-division of the great appendage, making it more similar to that of other megacheirans; and a complex joint of the exopod reflecting the arthropodâ€™s swimming capabilities.


CONCLUSIONS
different aspects of the morphology, for example, the morphology of the great appendage and the presence of a basipod with strong median armature on the biramous appendages indicate that l. superlata was an active and agile necto-benthic predator .
