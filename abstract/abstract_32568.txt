BACKGROUND
austronesian is a linguistic family spread in most areas of the southeast asia, the pacific ocean, and the indian ocean. based on their linguistic similarity, this linguistic family included malayo-polynesians and taiwan aborigines. the linguistic similarity also led to the controversial hypothesis that taiwan is the homeland of all the malayo-polynesians, a hypothesis that has been debated by ethnologists, linguists, archaeologists, and geneticists. it is well accepted that the eastern austronesians  derived from the western austronesians , and that the daic populations on the mainland are supposed to be the headstream of all the austronesian populations.


RESULTS
in this report, we studied  <dig> snps and  <dig> strs in the non-recombining region of the  <dig>  y chromosomes from  <dig> china daic populations,  <dig> indonesian and vietnam malayo-polynesian populations, and  <dig> taiwan aboriginal populations. these three groups show many resemblances in paternal lineages. admixture analyses demonstrated that the daic populations are hardly influenced by han chinese genetically, and that they make up the largest proportion of indonesians. most of the population samples contain a high frequency of haplogroup o1a-m <dig>  which is nearly absent in other ethnic families. the str network of haplogroup o1a* illustrated that indonesian lineages did not derive from taiwan aborigines as linguistic studies suggest, but from daic populations.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that, in contrast to the taiwan homeland hypothesis, the island southeast asians do not have a taiwan origin based on their paternal lineages. furthermore, we show that both taiwan aborigines and indonesians likely derived from the daic populations based on their paternal lineages. these two populations seem to have evolved independently of each other. our results indicate that a super-phylum, which includes taiwan aborigines, daic, and malayo-polynesians, is genetically educible.
