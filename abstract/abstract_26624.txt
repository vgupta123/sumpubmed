BACKGROUND
recently, naturally derived facial masks with beneficial biological properties have received increasing interest. in this study, silk sericin-releasing bacterial nanocellulose gel was developed to be applied as a bioactive mask for facial treatment.


RESULTS
the silk sericin-releasing bacterial nanocellulose gel produced at a ph of  <dig>  had an ultrafine and extremely pure fiber network structure. the mechanical properties and moisture absorption ability of the gel were improved, compared to those of the commercially available paper mask. silk sericin could be control-released from the gel. a peel test with porcine skin showed that the gel was less adhesive than the commercially available paper mask, which would be removed from the face more easily without pain. the in vitro cytotoxicity test showed that the gel was not toxic to l <dig> mouse fibroblast and hacat human keratinocyte cells. furthermore, when implanted subcutaneously and evaluated according to iso10993- <dig> standard, the gel was not irritant to tissue.


CONCLUSIONS
the silk sericin-releasing bacterial nanocellulose gel had appropriate physical and biological properties and safety for the facial treatment application.
