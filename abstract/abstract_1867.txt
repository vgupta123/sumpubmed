BACKGROUND
despite continuous research efforts, bacterio infecting lactococcus lactis starter strains persist as a major threat to dairy fermentations. the lactococcal p <dig> phages, which are currently classified into four sub-groups , are the second most frequently isolated phage group in an industrial dairy context.


RESULTS
the current work describes the isolation and comparative genomic analysis of  <dig> novel p <dig> group phages. detailed analysis of the genomic region of p <dig> phages encoding the so-called “baseplate”, which includes the receptor binding protein  was combined with a functional characterization of the rbp of sub-group iii and iv phages. additionally, calcium-dependence assays revealed a specific requirement for calcium by sub-group iv phages while host range analysis highlighted a higher number of strains with cwps type a  are infected by the p <dig> phages assessed in this study than those with a c , b  or unknown  cwps type.


CONCLUSIONS
these analyses revealed significant divergence among rbp sequences, apparently reflecting their unique interactions with the host and particularly for strains with a type a cwps. the implications of the genomic architecture of lactococcal p <dig> phages on serving as a general model for siphoviridae phages are discussed.
