BACKGROUND
blood feeding, or hematophagy, is a behavior exhibited by female mosquitoes required both for reproduction and for transmission of pathogens. we determined the expression patterns of  <dig>  ests, representing ~ <dig>  unique gene transcripts using cdna microarrays in adult female anopheles gambiae at selected times during the first two days following blood ingestion, at  <dig> and  <dig> min during a  <dig> minute blood meal and at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after completion of the blood meal and compared their expression to transcript levels in mosquitoes with access only to a sugar solution.


RESULTS
in blood-fed mosquitoes,  <dig> unique transcripts, approximately 25% of the total, were expressed at least two-fold above or below their levels in the sugar-fed mosquitoes, at one or more time points. these differentially expressed gene products were clustered using k-means clustering into early genes, middle genes, and late genes, containing  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> unique transcripts, respectively. several genes from each group were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr in order to validate the microarray results.


CONCLUSIONS
the expression patterns and annotation of the genes in these three groups  are discussed in the context of female mosquitoes' physiological responses to blood feeding, including blood digestion, peritrophic matrix formation, egg development, and immunity.
