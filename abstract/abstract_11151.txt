BACKGROUND
neutrophils leave the bone marrow as terminally differentiated cells, yet little is known of the influence of nicotine or other tobacco smoke components on neutrophil differentiation. therefore, promyelocytic hl- <dig> cells were differentiated into neutrophils using dimethylsulfoxide in the presence and absence of nicotine  pyridine). differentiation was evaluated over  <dig> days by monitoring terminal differentiation markers ; cell viability, growth phase, kinetics, and apoptosis; assessing cellular morphology and ultrastructure; and conformational changes to major cellular components. key neutrophil effector functions  were also examined.


RESULTS
nicotine increased the percentage of cells in late differentiation phases  compared to dmso alone , but did not affect any other marker of neutrophil differentiation examined. however, nicotine exposure during differentiation suppressed the oxidative burst in hl- <dig> cells ; inhibited bacterial killing ; and increased the lps-induced release of mmp- <dig>  but not mmp- <dig> . these phenomena may be Î±-7-acetylcholine nicotinic receptor-dependent. furthermore, smokers exhibited an increased mmp- <dig> burden compared to non-smokers in vivo .


CONCLUSIONS
these findings may partially explain the known increase in susceptibility to bacterial infection and neutrophil-associated destructive inflammatory diseases in individuals chronically exposed to nicotine.
