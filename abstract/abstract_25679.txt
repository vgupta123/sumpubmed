BACKGROUND
members of the genus cronobacter are causes of rare but severe illness in neonates and preterm infants following the ingestion of contaminated infant formula. seven species have been described and two of the species genomes were subsequently published. in this study, we performed comparative genomics on eight strains of cronobacter, including six that we sequenced  and two previously published, closed genomes.


RESULTS
we identified and characterized the features associated with the core and pan genome of the genus cronobacter in an attempt to understand the evolution of these bacteria and the genetic content of each species. we identified  <dig> genomic regions that are present in two or more cronobacter genomes, along with  <dig> unique genomic regions. many potentially horizontally transferred genes, such as lysogenic prophages, were also identified. most notable among these were several type six secretion system gene clusters, transposons that carried tellurium, copper and/or silver resistance genes, and a novel integrative conjugative element.


CONCLUSIONS
cronobacter have diverged into two clusters, one consisting of c. dublinensis and c. muytjensii  and the other comprised of c. sakazakii, c. malonaticus, c. universalis, and c. turicensis,  from the most recent common ancestral species. while several genetic determinants for plant-association and human virulence could be found in the core genome of cronobacter, the four cdub-cmuy clade genomes contained several accessory genomic regions important for survival in a plant-associated environmental niche, while the csak-cmal-cuni-ctur clade genomes harbored numerous virulence-related genetic traits.
