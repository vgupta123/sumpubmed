BACKGROUND
streptococcus suis is a zoonotic pathogen that causes infections in young piglets. s. suis is a heterogeneous species. thirty-three different capsular serotypes have been described, that differ in virulence between as well as within serotypes.


RESULTS
in this study, the correlation between gene content, serotype, phenotype and virulence among  <dig> s. suis strains was studied using comparative genome hybridization . clustering of cgh data divided s. suis isolates into two clusters, a and b. cluster a isolates could be discriminated from cluster b isolates based on the protein expression of extracellular factor . cluster a contained serotype  <dig> and  <dig> isolates that were correlated with virulence. cluster b mainly contained serotype  <dig> and  <dig> isolates. genetic similarity was observed between serotype  <dig> and serotype  <dig> isolates that do not express muramidase released protein  and ef , suggesting these isolates originated from a common founder. profiles of  <dig> putative virulence-associated genes of s. suis were determined among the  <dig> isolates. presence of all  <dig> genes was shown for cluster a isolates, whereas cluster b isolates lacked one or more putative virulence genes. divergence of s. suis isolates was further studied based on the presence of  <dig> regions of difference. conservation of genes was evaluated by the definition of a core genome that contained 78% of all orfs in p1/ <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we show that cgh is a valuable method to study distribution of genes or gene clusters among isolates in detail, yielding information on genetic similarity, and virulence traits of s. suis isolates.
