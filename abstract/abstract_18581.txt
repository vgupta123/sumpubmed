BACKGROUND
in eukaryotic cells, directional transport between different compartments of the endomembrane system is mediated by vesicles that bud from a donor organelle and then fuse with an acceptor organelle. a family of integral membrane proteins, termed soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor  proteins, constitute the key machineries of these different membrane fusion events. over the past  <dig> years, the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has served as a powerful model organism for studying the organization of the secretory and endocytic pathways, and a few years ago, its entire set of snares was compiled.


RESULTS
here, we make use of the increasing amount of genomic data to investigate the history of the snare family during fungi evolution. moreover, since different snare family members are thought to demarcate different organelles and vesicles, this approach allowed us to compare the organization of the endomembrane systems of yeast and animal cells. our data corroborate the notion that fungi generally encompass a relatively simple set of snare proteins, mostly comprising the snares of the proto-eukaryotic cell. however, all fungi contain a novel soluble snare protein, vam <dig>  which carries an n-terminal px-domain that acts as a phosphoinositide binding module. in addition, the points in fungal evolution, at which lineage-specific duplications and diversifications occurred, could be determined. for instance, the endosomal syntaxins pep <dig> and vam <dig> arose from a gene duplication that occurred within the saccharomycotina clade.


CONCLUSIONS
although the snare repertoire of baker's yeast is highly conserved, our analysis reveals that it is more deviated than the ones of basal fungi. this highlights that the trafficking pathways of baker's yeast are not only different to those in animal cells but also are somewhat different to those of many other fungi.
