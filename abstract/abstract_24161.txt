BACKGROUND
to control the spread of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  in hospitals, infection control measures such as hand hygiene practices were introduced into the teaching hospitals in shanghai, china, in  <dig>  currently, there is limited information characterizing the latest hospital-acquired s. aureus infections in this area. therefore, we sought to determine the prevalence, molecular characteristics, and genotype-phenotype correlation of hospital-acquired s. aureus infections in huashan hospital, one of the largest teaching hospitals in shanghai.


RESULTS
among  <dig> hospital-acquired s. aureus clinical isolates obtained from january to december of  <dig> in huashan hospital,  <dig> % were mrsa. the predominant mrsa clones were st239-sccmeciii and st5-sccmecii. st <dig> was mainly recovered from respiratory specimens and sterile body fluids, st <dig> was associated with respiratory specimens and blood, and st <dig> was most prevalent in urine samples. in this study,  <dig> dispersed sequence types  of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus  were identified, most of which caused skin/soft tissue infection and bacteremia. the frequencies of pvl-, mupa-, and qaca/b-positive isolates were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % respectively. mupa was more frequently identified in st <dig> and st <dig>  and qaca/b was more prevalent in st <dig> and st <dig>  most of the pvl-positive isolates were mssa, whereas the majority of mupa- and qaca/b-positive isolates were mrsa. st <dig> and st <dig> had higher resistance rates to multiple antibiotics. in huashan hospital, the infection rate in the intensive care unit  was  <dig>  per  <dig> hospitalized days, but only  <dig>  per  <dig> hospitalized days in the other wards. each ward harbored its own dominant sts. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed diversity within the same epidemic s. aureus clones originating from the same wards.


CONCLUSIONS
there is still a high prevalence of mrsa infections in the teaching hospital in shanghai. there were also differences in the major infection types caused by mrsa and mssa, and hospital-acquired s. aureus infections in the icu of huashan hospital pose a greater threat to patient safety than in other wards. the high proportion of multiple antibiotic and chlorhexidine-based antiseptic-resistant clones in this hospital underscores the need for more effective infection control measures to help curtail dissemination of mrsa to hospitalized patients.
