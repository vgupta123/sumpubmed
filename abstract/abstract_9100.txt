BACKGROUND
aschersonia badia  is an entomopathogenic fungus that specifically infects scale insects and whiteflies. we present the whole genome sequence of ab and its comparison with two clavicipitaceous fungi metarhizium robertsii  and m. acridum  that exhibit variable host preferences. here, through comparative analysis of pathogen-host interacting genes, carbohydrate active enzymes, secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes, and sexuality genes, we explore the proteins with possible virulence functions in clavicipitaceous fungi. comprehensive overview of gh <dig> family chitinases has been provided to decipher the role of chitinases in claviceptaceous fungi that are either host specific or generalists.


RESULTS
we report the  <dig>  mb draft genome of ab and its comparative genome analysis with mr and mac. the comparative analyses suggests expansion in pathogen-host interacting gene families and carbohydrate active enzyme families in mr, whilst their contraction in ab and mac genomes. the multi-modular nrps gene  responsible for biosynthesis of the secondary metabolite destruxin in mr is not conserved in ab, similar to the specialist pathogen mac. an additional siderophore biosynthetic gene responsible for acquisition of iron was identified in mr. further, the domain survey of chitinases suggest that the cbm <dig>  domains, which participate in chitin-binding functions, were not observed in mac, but were present in ab and mr. however, apparent differences in frequency of cbm <dig> domains associated with chitinases of ab and mr was identified, where mr chitinases displayed a higher proportion of associated cbm <dig> domains than ab chitinases.


CONCLUSIONS
this study suggests differences in distribution of dtxs <dig> and chitinases in specialists  and generalists  fungi. our analysis also suggests the presence of a siderophore biosynthetic gene in the mr genome which perhaps aids in enhanced virulence potential and host range. the variation in association of cbms, being higher in generalists  and lower in specialists  fungi may further be responsible for the differences in host affiliation.
