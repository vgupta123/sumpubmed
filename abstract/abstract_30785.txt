BACKGROUND
selection pressure on the number of teats has been applied to be able to provide enough teats for the increase in litter size in pigs. although many qtl were reported, they cover large chromosomal regions and the functional mutations and their underlying biological mechanisms have not yet been identified. to gain a better insight in the genetic architecture of the trait number of teats, we performed a genome-wide association study by genotyping  <dig> large white pigs using the illumina porcinesnp <dig> beadchip. the analysis is based on deregressed breeding values to account for the dense family structure and a bayesian approach for estimation of the snp effects.


RESULTS
the genome-wide association study resulted in  <dig> significant snps. in total,  <dig> qtl regions were defined including  <dig> snps on  <dig> sus scrofa chromosomes  of which  <dig> regions on ssc <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were highly significant. all significantly associated regions together explain  <dig> % of the genetic variance where a qtl on ssc <dig> explains the most genetic variance . for the five highly significant qtl regions, a search for candidate genes was performed. the most convincing candidate genes were vrtn and prox <dig> on ssc <dig>  mpp <dig>  armc <dig>  and mkx on ssc <dig>  and vertebrae δ-ef <dig> on ssc <dig>  all three qtl contain candidate genes which are known to be associated with vertebral development. in the new qtl regions on ssc <dig> and ssc <dig>  no obvious candidate genes were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
five major qtl were found at high resolution on ssc <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of which the qtl on ssc <dig> and ssc <dig> are the first ones to be reported on these chromosomes. the significant snps found in this study could be used in selection to increase number of teats in pigs, so that the increasing number of live-born piglets can be nursed by the sow. this study points to common genetic mechanisms regulating number of vertebrae and number of teats.
