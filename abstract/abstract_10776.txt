BACKGROUND
fusarium head blight  is a disease of cereal crops, which has a severe impact on wheat and barley production worldwide. apart from reducing the yield and impairing grain quality, fhb leads to contamination of grain with toxic secondary metabolites , which pose a health risk to humans and livestock. the fusarium species primarily involved in fhb are f. graminearum and f. culmorum. a key prerequisite for a reduction in the incidence of fhb is an understanding of its epidemiology.


RESULTS
we describe a duplex-pcr-based method for the simultaneous detection of f. culmorum and f. graminearum in plant material. species-specific pcr products are identified by melting curve analysis performed in a real-time thermocycler in the presence of the fluorescent dye sybr green i. in contrast to multiplex real-time pcr assays, the method does not use doubly labeled hybridization probes.


CONCLUSIONS
pcr with product differentiation by melting curve analysis offers a cost-effective means of qualitative analysis for the presence of f. culmorum and f. graminearum in plant material. this method is particularly suitable for epidemiological studies involving a large number of samples.
