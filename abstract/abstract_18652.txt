BACKGROUND
plants involved in highly complex and well-coordinated systems have evolved a considerable degree of developmental plasticity, thus minimizing the damage caused by stress. micrornas  have recently emerged as key regulators in gene regulation, developmental processes and stress tolerance in plants.


RESULTS
in this study, soybean mirnas associated with stress responses  have been identified and analyzed in combination with deep sequencing technology and in-depth bioinformatics analysis. one hundred and thirty three conserved mirnas representing  <dig> mirna families were expressed in soybeans under three treatments. in addition,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mirnas are either uniquely or differently expressed under drought, salinity, and alkalinity, respectively, suggesting that many mirnas are inducible and are differentially expressed in response to certain stress.


CONCLUSIONS
our study has important implications for further identification of gene regulation under abiotic stresses and significantly contributes a complete profile of mirnas in glycine max.
