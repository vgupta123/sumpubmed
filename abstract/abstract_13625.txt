BACKGROUND
post-genome era brings about diverse categories of omics data. inference and analysis of genetic regulatory networks act prominently in extracting inherent mechanisms, discovering and interpreting the related biological nature and living principles beneath mazy phenomena, and eventually promoting the well-beings of humankind.


RESULTS
a supervised combinatorial-optimization pattern based on information and signal-processing theories is introduced into the inference and analysis of genetic regulatory networks. an associativity measure is proposed to define the regulatory strength/connectivity, and a phase-shift metric determines regulatory directions among components of the reconstructed networks. thus, it solves the undirected regulatory problems arising from most of current linear/nonlinear relevance methods. in case of computational and topological redundancy, we constrain the classified group size of pair candidates within a multiobjective combinatorial optimization  pattern.


CONCLUSIONS
we testify the proposed approach on two real-world microarray datasets of different statistical characteristics. thus, we reveal the inherent design mechanisms for genetic networks by quantitative means, facilitating further theoretic analysis and experimental design with diverse research purposes. qualitative comparisons with other methods and certain related focuses needing further work are illustrated within the discussion section.
