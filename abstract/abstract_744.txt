BACKGROUND
intracellular membrane traffic is an essential component of the membrane remodeling that supports lamellipodium extension during cell adhesion. the membrane trafficking pathways that contribute to cell adhesion have not been fully elucidated, but recent studies have implicated snare proteins. here, the functions of several snares  are characterized during the processes of cell spreading and membrane ruffling.


RESULTS
we report the first description of a snare complex, containing snap <dig>  syntaxin <dig> and cellubrevin/vamp <dig>  that is induced by cell adhesion to an extracellular matrix. impairing the function of the snares in the complex using inhibitory snare domains disrupted the recycling endosome, impeded delivery of integrins to the cell surface, and reduced haptotactic cell migration and spreading. blocking snap <dig> also inhibited the formation of pma-stimulated, f-actin-rich membrane ruffles; however, membrane ruffle formation was not significantly altered by inhibition of vamp <dig> or syntaxin <dig>  in contrast, membrane ruffling, and not cell spreading, was sensitive to inhibition of two snares within the biosynthetic secretory pathway, gs <dig> and vamp <dig>  consistent with this, formation of a complex containing vamp <dig> and snap <dig> was enhanced by treatment of cells with pma. the results reveal a requirement for the function of a snap23-syntaxin13-vamp <dig> complex in the formation of lamellipodia during cell adhesion and of a vamp4-snap23-containing complex during pma-induced membrane ruffling.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that different snare-mediated trafficking pathways support membrane remodeling during ecm-induced lamellipodium extension and pma-induced ruffle formation, pointing to important mechanistic differences between these processes.
