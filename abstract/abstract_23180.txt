BACKGROUND
biogenic amines are molecules with allergenic properties. they are found in fermented products and are synthesized by lactic acid bacteria through the decarboxylation of amino acids present in the food matrix. the concentration of biogenic amines in fermented foodstuffs is influenced by many environmental factors, and in particular, biogenic amine accumulation depends on the quantity of available precursors. enological practices which lead to an enrichment in nitrogen compounds therefore favor biogenic amine production in wine. free amino acids are the only known precursors for the synthesis of biogenic amines, and no direct link has previously been demonstrated between the use of peptides by lactic acid bacteria and biogenic amine synthesis.


RESULTS
here we demonstrate for the first time that a lactobacillus plantarum strain isolated from a red wine can produce the biogenic amine tyramine from peptides containing tyrosine. in our conditions, most of the tyramine was produced during the late exponential growth phase, coinciding with the expression of the tyrdc and tyrp genes. the dna sequences of tyrdc and tyrp in this strain share 98% identity with those in lactobacillus brevis consistent with horizontal gene transfer from l. brevis to l. plantarum.
