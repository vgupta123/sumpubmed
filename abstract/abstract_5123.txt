BACKGROUND
one of the most commonly applied protectotype vaccination protocol against infectious bronchitis  in broiler chickens in the eu is simultaneous or alternate use of ma <dig> and 4/ <dig> vaccine strains. after ib vaccination and infection, systemic and upper respiratory tract , humoral and cell-mediated immunity , are stimulated. the level of this stimulation correlates with the level of protection against ib.


RESULTS
we’ve investigated the development of urt and systemic, cell-mediated and humoral immunity in commercial broiler chickens vaccinated with ma <dig> and/or 4/ <dig> strains at hatch day. we’ve demonstrated that the group vaccinated with ma <dig> and 4/ <dig> strain simultaneously developed the most desirable immunity which reflects the level of cd8+ t cells stimulation in spleen and harderian gland, as well as the level of iga and igy in urt washings and serum and their cross-reactivity with  <dig> ibv strains.


CONCLUSIONS
although we did not demonstrate directly why ma5 + 4/ <dig> protocol is so efficient it seems that it combines the benefits of monovalent vaccination with either ma <dig> or 4/ <dig> and while ma <dig> seems to stimulate cmi more efficiently, the 4/ <dig> strain generates a wider spectrum of immune system cross-reactivity and higher urt iga production.
