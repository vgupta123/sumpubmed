BACKGROUND
syringolin a, an important virulence factor in the interaction of the phytopathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae b728a with its host plant phaseolus vulgaris , was recently shown to irreversibly inhibit eukaryotic proteasomes by a novel mechanism. syringolin a is synthesized by a mixed non-ribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthetase and consists of a tripeptide part including a twelve-membered ring with an n-terminal valine that is joined to a second valine via a very unusual ureido group. analysis of sequence and architecture of the syringolin a synthetase gene cluster with the five open reading frames syla-syle allowed to formulate a biosynthesis model that explained all structural features of the tripeptide part of syringolin a but left the biosynthesis of the unusual ureido group unaccounted for.


RESULTS
we have cloned a  <dig> kb genomic fragment containing the syla-syle gene cluster but no other complete gene into the broad host range cosmid plafr <dig>  transfer of the recombinant cosmid into pseudomonas putida and p. syringae pv. syringae sm was sufficient to direct the biosynthesis of bona fide syringolin a in these heterologous organisms whose genomes do not contain homologous genes. nmr analysis of syringolin a isolated from cultures grown in the presence of nah13co <dig> revealed preferential 13c-labeling at the ureido carbonyl position.


CONCLUSIONS
the results show that no additional syringolin a-specific genes were needed for the biosynthesis of the enigmatic ureido group joining two amino acids. they reveal the source of the ureido carbonyl group to be bicarbonate/carbon dioxide, which we hypothesize is incorporated by carbamylation of valine mediated by the sylc gene product. a similar mechanism may also play a role in the biosynthesis of other ureido-group-containing nrps products known largely from cyanobacteria.
