BACKGROUND
the power of the genome wide association studies starts to go down when the minor allele frequency  is below  <dig> . here, we proposed the use of cohen’s h in detecting disease associated rare variants. the variance stabilizing effect based on the arcsine square root transformation of mafs to generate cohen’s h contributed to the statistical power for rare variants analysis. we re-analyzed published datasets, one microarray and one sequencing based, and used simulation to compare the performance of cohen’s h with the risk difference  and odds ratio .


RESULTS
the analysis showed that the type  <dig> error rate of cohen’s h was as expected and cohen’s h and rd were both less biased and had higher power than or. the advantage of cohen’s h was more obvious when maf was less than  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
cohen’s h can increase the power to find genetic association of rare variants and diseases, especially when maf is less than  <dig> .
