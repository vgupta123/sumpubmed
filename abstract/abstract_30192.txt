BACKGROUND
in east asia, an increasing number of studies on temperate forest tree species find evidence for migration and gene exchange across the east china sea  land bridge up until the last glacial maximum . however, it is less clear when and how lineages diverged in this region, whether in full isolation or in the face of post-divergence gene flow. here, we investigate the effects of quaternary changes in climate and sea level on the evolutionary and demographic history of platycrater arguta, a rare temperate understorey shrub with disjunct distributions in east china  and south japan . molecular data were obtained from  <dig> p. arguta populations to infer current patterns of molecular structure and diversity in relation to past  and present distributions based on ecological niche modelling . a coalescent-based isolation-with-migration  model was used to estimate lineage divergence times and population demographic parameters.


RESULTS
combining information from nuclear/chloroplast sequence data with nuclear microsatellites, our im analyses identify the two varieties as genetically distinct units that evolved in strict allopatry since the mid-pleistocene, c.  <dig>   ma. together with bayesian skyeline plots, our data further suggest that both lineages experienced post-divergence demographic growth, followed by refugial isolation, divergence, and in the case of var. arguta post-glacial admixture. however, past species distribution modelling indicates that the species’ overall distribution has not greatly changed over the last glacial cycles.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings highlight the important influence of ancient sea-level changes on the diversification of east asia’s temperate flora. implicitly, they challenge the notion of general temperate forest expansion across the ecs land bridge, demonstrating instead its ‘filter’ effect owing to an unsuitable environment for certain species and their biological  properties.
