BACKGROUND
host parasitism by trichomonas vaginalis is complex. adherence to vaginal epithelial cells  is mediated by surface proteins. we showed before that antisense down-regulation of expression of adhesin ap <dig> decreased amounts of protein, which lowered levels of t. vaginalis adherence to vecs. we now perform antisense down-regulation of expression of the ap <dig> gene to evaluate and confirm a role for ap <dig> in adherence by t. vaginalis. we also used an established transfection system for heterologous expression of ap <dig> in t. foetus as an additional confirmatory approach.


RESULTS
we successfully select stable trichomonads with sense  and antisense  plasmids. rt-pcr confirmed decreased amounts of ap <dig> mrna in as-transfected parasites, and decreased amounts of ap <dig> had no effect on growth and viability when compared to wild-type  trichomonads. immunoblots of proteins from as-transfectants gave significant decreased amounts of functional ap <dig> capable of binding to host cells compared to wt- and s-transfected trichomonads. as expected, as-transfectants had lower levels of adherence to vecs, which was related to reduction in surface expression of ap <dig>  stable expression of t. vaginalis ap33::ha fusion in t. foetus was confirmed by immunoblots and fluorescence. the episomally-expressed surface ap33::ha fusion increased adherence of trichomonads to human vecs, which was abrogated with anti-ap <dig> serum.


CONCLUSIONS
these results using both antisense inhibition of gene expression and ap <dig> synthesis and the heterologous expression of ap <dig> in t. foetus confirms a role for this protein as an adhesin in t. vaginalis.
