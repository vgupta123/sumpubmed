BACKGROUND
corynebacterium ulcerans has been detected as a commensal in domestic and wild animals that may serve as reservoirs for zoonotic infections. during the last decade, the frequency and severity of human infections associated with c. ulcerans appear to be increasing in various countries. as the knowledge of genes contributing to the virulence of this bacterium was very limited, the complete genome sequences of two c. ulcerans strains detected in the metropolitan area of rio de janeiro were determined and characterized by comparative genomics: c. ulcerans  <dig> was initially isolated from an elderly woman with fatal pulmonary infection and c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> was recovered from a nasal sample of an asymptomatic dog.


RESULTS
the circular chromosome of c. ulcerans  <dig> has a total size of  <dig> , <dig> bp and encodes  <dig>  predicted proteins, whereas the genome of c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> is  <dig>  bp larger and comprises  <dig>  protein-coding regions. the minor difference in size of the two genomes is mainly caused by additional prophage-like elements in the c. ulcerans br-ad <dig> chromosome. both genomes show a highly similar order of orthologous coding regions; and both strains share a common set of  <dig>  genes, demonstrating their very close relationship. a screening for prominent virulence factors revealed the presence of phospholipase d , neuraminidase h , endoglycosidase e , and subunits of adhesive pili of the spadef type that are encoded in both c. ulcerans genomes. the rbp gene coding for a putative ribosome-binding protein with striking structural similarity to shiga-like toxins was additionally detected in the genome of the human isolate c. ulcerans  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the molecular data deduced from the complete genome sequences provides considerable knowledge of virulence factors in c. ulcerans that is increasingly recognized as an emerging pathogen. this bacterium is apparently equipped with a broad and varying set of virulence factors, including a novel type of a ribosome-binding protein. whether the respective protein contributes to the severity of human infections  remains to be elucidated by genetic experiments with defined bacterial mutants and host model systems.
