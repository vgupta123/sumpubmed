BACKGROUND
position-specific priors have been shown to be a flexible and elegant way to extend the power of gibbs sampler-based motif discovery algorithms. information of many types–including sequence conservation, nucleosome positioning, and negative examples–can be converted into a prior over the location of motif sites, which then guides the sequence motif discovery algorithm. this approach has been shown to confer many of the benefits of conservation-based and discriminative motif discovery approaches on gibbs sampler-based motif discovery methods, but has not previously been studied with methods based on expectation maximization .


RESULTS
we extend the popular em-based meme algorithm to utilize position-specific priors and demonstrate their effectiveness for discovering transcription factor  motifs in yeast and mouse dna sequences. utilizing a discriminative, conservation-based prior dramatically improves meme's ability to discover motifs in  <dig> yeast tf chip-chip datasets, more than doubling the number of datasets where it finds the correct motif. on these datasets, meme using the prior has a higher success rate than eight other conservation-based motif discovery approaches. we also show that the same type of prior improves the accuracy of motifs discovered by meme in mouse tf chip-seq data, and that the motifs tend to be of slightly higher quality those found by a gibbs sampling algorithm using the same prior.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that using position-specific priors can substantially increase the power of em-based motif discovery algorithms such as meme algorithm.
