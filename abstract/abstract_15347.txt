BACKGROUND
in order to understand and regulate complex genetic networks in living cells, it is important to build simple and well-defined genetic circuits. we designed such circuits using a synthetic biology approach that included mathematical modeling and simulation, with a focus on the effects by which downstream reporter genes are involved in the regulation of synthetic genetic circuits.


RESULTS
our results indicated that downstream genes exert two main effects on genes involved in the regulation of synthetic genetic circuits:  competition for regulatory proteins and  protein degradation in the cell.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings regarding the effects of downstream genes on regulatory genes and the role of impedance in driving large-scale and complex genetic circuits may facilitate the design of more accurate genetic circuits. this design will have wide applications in future studies of systems and synthetic biology.
