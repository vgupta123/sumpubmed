BACKGROUND
tumor necrosis factor alpha  plays a central role in the initiation and maintenance of immune responses to periodontopathic bacteria. however, excess tnf-α leads to dysregulated immune responses and progression of periodontitis. porphyromonas gingivalis  invades gingival epithelial cells and then multiplies and survives for a long period. additionally, increment of tnf-α in periodontal sites is associated with a high prevalence of gram-negative anaerobes such as p. gingivalis. however, it has not been determined whether tnf-α affects invasion of p. gingivalis in periodontal tissues.


RESULTS
we examined the effect of tnf-α on invasion of p. gingivalis in gingival epithelial cells and clarified the mechanism by which tnf-α augments invasion of p. gingivalis. invasion of p. gingivalis into ca9- <dig> cells was augmented by stimulation with tnf-α and it was inhibited by treatment with an antibody to tnf receptor- <dig>  tnf-α increased production of icam- <dig>  and p. gingivalis invasion was inhibited by an antibody to icam- <dig> in ca9- <dig> cells. silencing of rab <dig> mrna inhibited p. gingivalis invasion. furthermore, the jnk inhibitor sp <dig> inhibited invasion of p. gingivalis and also decreased the active form of rab <dig> in ca9- <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
tnf-α augments invasion of p. gingivalis in human gingival epithelial cells through increment of icam- <dig> and activation of rab <dig>  these phenomena may contribute to persistent infection of p. ginigvalis and prolongation of immune responses in periodontal tissues.
