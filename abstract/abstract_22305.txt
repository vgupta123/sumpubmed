BACKGROUND
cis-planaramineplatinum complexes like their trans isomers are often found to be active against cancer cell lines. the present study deals with the synthesis, characterization and determination of activity of new cis-planaramineplatinum complexes.


RESULTS
two cis-planaramineplatinum complexes: cis-dichloroplatinum  and cis-dichloroplatinum  have been prepared and characterised based on elemental analyses, ir, raman, mass and 1h nmr spectral measurements. the interactions of the compounds with pbr <dig> plasmid dna have been investigated and their activity against ovarian cancer cell lines: a <dig>  a2780cisr and a2780zd047rhave been determined. like cisplatin, ah <dig> and ah <dig> are believed to form mainly monofunctional n <dig> and bifunctional intrastrand n7n <dig> adducts with dna, causing a local distortion of a dna strand. as a result, gel mobility of the dna changes. both ah <dig> and ah <dig> are found to be less active than cisplatin against the three cell lines with ah <dig> being the more active compound of the two. the higher activity of ah <dig> is in line with its lower molar conductivity value corresponding to a lower degree of dissociation.


CONCLUSIONS
the differences in activity of ah <dig>  ah <dig> and cisplatin against the cell lines illustrate structure-activity relationship.
