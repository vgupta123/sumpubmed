BACKGROUND
visceral leishmaniasis is an emerging zoonosis and its geographic distribution is restricted to tropical and temperate regions. most of the individuals infected in latin america are in brazil. despite the control measures that have been adopted, the disease is spreading throughout new regions of the country. domestic dogs are involved in the transmission cycle and are considered to be the main epidemiologic reservoir of leishmania infantum . our aim was to determine the prevalence of canine leishmaniasis  and ehrlichiosis infection in presidente prudente as well as the spatial dispersion of the disease in the western region of são paulo state.

methods
dogs underwent clinical examination and symptoms related to cl were recorded. anti-leishmania antibodies were detected using elisa, rk39-immunocromatographic tests , and an indirect fluorescent antibody test . anti-e. canis antibodies were detected by ifat. a follow-up was conducted in dogs that were positive in the elisa at the baseline study. data on the spatial distribution of l. longipalpis and cl in são paulo state were obtained from brazilian public health agencies.


RESULTS
serum samples from  <dig> dogs were analyzed. the seroprevalence of cl was  <dig>  % by elisa and  <dig>  % by ifat. in the follow-up, seroprevalence was  <dig>  % by elisa,  <dig>  % by ifat,  <dig>  % by dpp test, and  <dig>  % for e. canis. there was a significant positive association between leishmania and e. canis infection . in the follow-up, clinical examinations revealed symptoms compatible with cl in  <dig>  % of the dogs. l. longipalpis was found in  <dig> and cl in  <dig> counties of the presidente prudente mesoregion. the dispersion route followed the west frontier of são paulo state toward paraná state.


CONCLUSIONS
low cl and high ehrlichiosis prevalence rates were found in presidente prudente city. this emerging focus of cl is moving through the western region of são paulo state toward the border of paraná state. integrated actions to fight the vector, parasites, infected dogs, and humans are needed to monitor the disease and implement strategies for epidemiologic control.
