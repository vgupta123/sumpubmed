BACKGROUND
abattoir detected pathologies are of crucial importance to both pig production and food safety. usually, more than one pathology coexist in a pig herd although it often remains unknown how these different pathologies interrelate to each other. identification of the associations between different pathologies may facilitate an improved understanding of their underlying biological linkage, and support the veterinarians in encouraging control strategies aimed at reducing the prevalence of not just one, but two or more conditions simultaneously.


RESULTS
multi-dimensional machine learning methodology was used to identify associations between ten typical pathologies in  <dig> batches of slaughtered finishing pigs, assisting the comprehension of their biological association. pathologies potentially associated with septicaemia  appear interrelated, suggesting on-going bacterial challenges by pathogens such as haemophilus parasuis and streptococcus suis. furthermore, hepatic scarring appears interrelated with both milk spot livers  and bacteria-related pathologies, suggesting a potential multi-pathogen nature for this pathology.


CONCLUSIONS
the application of novel multi-dimensional machine learning methodology provided new insights into how typical pig pathologies are potentially interrelated at batch level. the methodology presented is a powerful exploratory tool to generate hypotheses, applicable to a wide range of studies in veterinary research.
