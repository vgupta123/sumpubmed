BACKGROUND
better treatments for schizophrenia are urgently needed. the therapeutic use of the nitric oxide -donor sodium nitroprusside  in patients with schizophrenia has shown promising results. the role of no in schizophrenia is still unclear, and no modulation is unexplored in ketamine  animal models to date. in the present study, we compared the behavioral effects of pre- and post-treatment with snp, glyceryl trinitrate , and methylene blue  in the acute ket animal model of schizophrenia.

the present study was designed to test whether acute snp, gtn, and mb treatment taken after  or before  a single ket injection would influence the behavior of rats in the sucrose preference test, object recognition task and open field.


RESULTS
the results showed that ket induced cognitive deficits and hyperlocomotion. long- term memory improvement was seen with the therapeutic gtn and snp treatment, but not with the preventive one. mb pretreatment resulted in long-term memory recovery. gtn pre-, but not post-treatment, tended to increase vertical and horizontal activity in the ket model. therapeutic and preventive snp treatment consistently decreased ket-induced hyperlocomotion.


CONCLUSIONS
no donors – especially snp – are promising new pharmacological candidates in the treatment of schizophrenia. in addition, we showed that the potential impact of no-related compounds on ket-induced behavioral changes may depend on the temporal window of drug administration.
