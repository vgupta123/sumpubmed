BACKGROUND
the yield of wheat , an important crop, is adversely affected by heat stress in many regions of the world. however, the molecular mechanisms underlying thermotolerance are largely unknown.


RESULTS
a novel ferritin gene, tafer, was identified from our previous heat stress-responsive transcriptome analysis of a heat-tolerant wheat cultivar . tafer was mapped to chromosome 5b and named tafer-5b. expression pattern analysis revealed that tafer-5b was induced by heat, polyethylene glycol , h2o <dig> and fe-ethylenediaminedi acid . to confirm the function of tafer-5b in wheat, tafer-5b was transformed into the wheat cultivar jimai <dig> , and the transgenic plants exhibited enhanced thermotolerance. to examine whether the function of ferritin from mono- and dico-species is conserved, tafer-5b was transformed into arabidopsis, and overexpression of tafer-5b functionally complemented the heat stress-sensitive phenotype of a ferritin-lacking mutant of arabidopsis. moreover, tafer-5b is essential for protecting cells against heat stress associated with protecting cells against ros. in addition, tafer-5b overexpression also enhanced drought, oxidative and excess iron stress tolerance associated with the ros scavenging. finally, tafer-5b transgenic arabidopsis and wheat plants exhibited improved leaf iron content.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that tafer-5b plays an important role in enhancing tolerance to heat stress and other abiotic stresses associated with the ros scavenging.
