BACKGROUND
common bean is a legume of social and nutritional importance as a food crop, cultivated worldwide especially in developing countries, accounting for an important source of income for small farmers. the availability of the complete sequences of the two common bean genomes has dramatically accelerated and has enabled new experimental strategies to be applied for genetic research. dartseq has been widely used as a method of snp genotyping allowing comprehensive genome coverage with genetic applications in common bean breeding programs.


RESULTS
using this technology,  <dig> snps  were genotyped in genic  and non-genic regions . genetic subdivision associated to the common bean gene pools  and related to grain types  were reported. a total of 83% and 91% of all snps were polymorphic within the andean and mesoamerican gene pools, respectively, and 26% were able to differentiate the gene pools. genetic diversity analysis revealed an average h
e of  <dig>  for the whole collection,  <dig>  for andean and  <dig>  for mesoamerican gene pools ,  <dig>  for the group of cultivars and lines, and  <dig>  for the group of landrace accessions . the snp effects were predicted with predominance of impact on non-coding regions . snps under selection were identified within gene pools comparing landrace and cultivar/line germplasm groups  and between the gene pools , predominantly on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  the ld extension estimate corrected for population structure and relatedness  was ~  <dig> kbp, while for the andean gene pool was ~  <dig> kbp, and for the mesoamerican was ~  <dig> kbp.


CONCLUSIONS
for common bean, dartseq provides an efficient and cost-effective strategy of generating snps for large-scale genome-wide studies. the dartseq resulted in an operational panel of  <dig> polymorphic snps in linkage equilibrium, providing high genome coverage. this snp set could be used in genotyping platforms with many applications, such as population genetics, phylogeny relation between common bean varieties and support to molecular breeding approaches.
