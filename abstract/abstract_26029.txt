BACKGROUND
delayed or secondary cell death that is caused by a cascade of cellular and molecular processes initiated by traumatic brain injury  may be reduced or prevented if an effective neuroprotective strategy is employed. microarray and subsequent bioinformatic analyses were used to determine which genes, pathways and networks were significantly altered 24 h after unilateral tbi in the rat. ipsilateral hemi-brain, the corresponding contralateral hemi-brain, and naïve  brain tissue were used for microarray analysis.


RESULTS
ingenuity pathway analysis showed cell death and survival  to be a top molecular and cellular function associated with tbi on both sides of the brain. one major finding was that the overall gene expression pattern suggested an increase in cd genes in ipsilateral brain tissue and suppression of cd genes contralateral to the injury which may indicate an endogenous protective mechanism. we created networks of genes of interest  and ranked the genes by the number of direct connections each had in the goi networks, creating gene interaction hierarchies . cell cycle was determined from the resultant gihs to be a significant molecular and cellular function in post-tbi cd gene response.


CONCLUSIONS
cell cycle and apoptosis signalling genes that were highly ranked in the gihs and exhibited either the inverse ipsilateral/contralateral expression pattern or contralateral suppression were identified and included stat <dig>  ccnd <dig>  ccnd <dig>  and bax. additional exploration into the remote suppression of cd genes may provide insight into neuroprotective mechanisms that could be used to develop therapies to prevent cell death following tbi.
