BACKGROUND
relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia  is one of the main causes of mortality in childhood malignancies. previous genetic studies demonstrated that chemoresistant all is driven by activating mutations in nt5c <dig>  the gene encoding cytosolic 5´-nucleotidase . however, molecular mechanisms underlying this hyperactivation are still unknown. here, we present kinetic and structural properties of cn-ii variants that represent 75 % of mutated alleles in patients who experience relapsed all .


RESULTS
enzyme kinetics measurements revealed that the mutants are consitutively active without need for allosteric activators. this shows that hyperactivity is not caused by a direct catalytic effect but rather by misregulation of cn-ii. x-ray crystallography combined with mass spectrometry-based techniques demonstrated that this misregulation is driven by structural modulation of the oligomeric interface within the cn-ii homotetrameric assembly. these specific conformational changes are shared between the studied variants, despite the relatively random spatial distribution of the mutations.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings define a common molecular mechanism for cn-ii hyperactivity, which provides a solid basis for targeted therapy of leukemia. our study highlights the cn-ii oligomerization interface as an attractive pharmacological target.
