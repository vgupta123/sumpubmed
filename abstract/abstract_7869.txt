BACKGROUND
cellular responses to death-promoting stimuli typically proceed through a differentiated multistage process, involving a lag phase, extensive death, and potential adaptation. deregulation of this chain of events is at the root of many diseases. improper adaptation is particularly important because it allows cell sub-populations to survive even in the continuous presence of death conditions, which results, among others, in the eventual failure of many targeted anticancer therapies.


RESULTS
here, i show that these typical responses arise naturally from the interplay of intracellular variability with a threshold-based control mechanism that detects cellular changes in addition to just the cellular state itself. implementation of this mechanism in a quantitative model for t-cell apoptosis, a prototypical example of programmed cell death, captures with exceptional accuracy experimental observations for different expression levels of the oncogene bcl-xl and directly links adaptation with noise in an atp threshold below which cells die.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that oncogenes like bcl-xl, besides regulating absolute death values, can have a novel role as active controllers of cell-cell variability and the extent of adaptation.
