BACKGROUND
detailed knowledge of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that direct spatial and temporal gene expression in pre-implantation embryos is critical for understanding the control of the maternal-zygotic transition and cell differentiation in early embryonic development. in this study, twenty-three clones, expressed at different stages of early mouse development, were identified using differential display reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction . one of these clones, which is expressed in 2-cell stage embryos at  <dig> hr post-hcg injection, shows a perfect sequence homology to the gene encoding the granzyme g protein. the granzyme family members are serine proteases that are present in the secretory granules of cytolytic t lymphocytes. however, the pattern of granzyme g expression and its function in early mouse embryos are entirely unknown.


RESULTS
upon the introduction of an antisense morpholino  against granzyme g to knock-down endogenous gene function, all embryos were arrested at the 2- to 4-cell stages of egg cleavage, and the de novo synthesis of zygotic rnas was decreased. the embryonic survival rate was dramatically decreased at the late 2-cell stage when serine protease-specific inhibitors,  <dig>  mm  <dig> -dichloroisocoumarin , and  <dig> mm phenyl methanesulphonyl fluoride , were added to the in vitro embryonic culture medium. survival was not affected by the addition of  <dig>  mm edta, a metalloproteinase inhibitor.


CONCLUSIONS
we characterized for the first time the expression and function of granzyme g during early stage embryogenesis. our data suggest that granzyme g is an important factor in early mouse embryonic development and may play a novel role in the elimination of maternal proteins and the triggering of zygotic gene expression during the maternal-zygotic transition.
