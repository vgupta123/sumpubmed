BACKGROUND
camelina  is well known for its high unsaturated fatty acid content and great resistance to environmental stress. however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in this annual oilseed crop. to gain greater insight into this mechanism, the transcriptome profiles of seeds at different developmental stages were analyzed by  <dig> pyrosequencing.


RESULTS
sequencing of two normalized  <dig> libraries produced  <dig>  clean reads. a total of  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of 642 bp were obtained by de novo assembly, and  <dig>  up-regulated and  <dig>  down-regulated unigenes were identified in the  <dig> daf  library compared with the  <dig> daf library. functional annotations showed that  <dig> genes annotated as fatty acid biosynthesis genes were up-regulated in  <dig> daf sample. among them,  <dig> candidate unigenes were characterized as responsible for polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis. to verify unigene expression levels calculated from the transcriptome analysis results, quantitative real-time pcr was performed on  <dig> randomly selected genes from the  <dig> up-regulated genes;  <dig> showed consistency between qrt-pcr and  <dig> pyrosequencing results.


CONCLUSIONS
investigation of gene expression levels revealed  <dig>  genes involved in seed development, many of which showed significant changes in the  <dig> daf sample compared with the  <dig> daf sample. our  <dig> pyrosequencing data for the camelina transcriptome provide an insight into the molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways of polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in camelina. the genes characterized in our research will provide candidate genes for the genetic modification of crops.
