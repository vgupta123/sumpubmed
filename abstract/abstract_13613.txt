BACKGROUND
the meningococcal capsule is an important virulence determinant. unencapsulated meningococci lacking capsule biosynthesis genes and containing the capsule null locus  are predominantly non-pathogenic. rare cases of invasive meningococcal disease caused by cnl isolates belonging to sequence types  and clonal complexes  st- <dig> , st- <dig> , st- <dig>  and st- <dig>  have been documented. the clinical significance of these isolates however remains unclear. we identified four invasive cnl meningococci through laboratory-based surveillance in south africa from  <dig> through  <dig>  which we aimed to characterize using whole genome data.


RESULTS
one isolate  contained cnl allele  <dig>  and caused empyema in an adult male with bronchiectasis from tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus and a smoking history. three isolates were ng: p <dig> - <dig> -2: fΔ: st- <dig>  and contained cnl allele  <dig>  one patient was an adolescent male with meningitis. the remaining two isolates were from recurrent disease episodes  in a male child with deficiency of the sixth complement component, and with the exception of two single nucleotide polymorphisms, contained identical core genomes. the st- <dig>  isolate possessed alleles for nhba peptide  <dig> and fhbp variant 2; whilst the st- <dig>  isolates contained nhba peptide  <dig> and fhbp variant  <dig>  all four isolates lacked nada. comparison of the south african genomes to  <dig> additional cnl genomes on the pubmlst neisseria database , determined that most putative virulence genes could be found in both invasive and carriage phenotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
although rare, invasive disease by cnl meningococci may be associated with host immunodeficiency and such patients may benefit from protein-based meningococcal vaccines.
