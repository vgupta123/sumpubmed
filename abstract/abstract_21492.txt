BACKGROUND
walnut  is an economically important tree crop. resistance to anthracnose, caused by colletotrichum gloeosporioides, is a major objective of walnut genetic improvement in china. the recently developed specific length amplified fragment sequencing  is an efficient strategy that can obtain large numbers of markers with sufficient sequence information to construct high-density genetic maps and permits detection of quantitative trait loci  for molecular breeding.


RESULTS
slaf-seq generated  <dig>  m paired-end reads.  <dig>  slaf markers were obtained, of which  <dig>  were polymorphic.  <dig>  polymorphic markers were sorted into five segregation types and  <dig>  markers of them were used to construct genetic linkage maps:  <dig>  of these fell into  <dig> linkage groups  for the female map,  <dig> markers for the male map, and  <dig>  markers for the integrated map. taking into account the size of all lgs, the marker coverage was  <dig> .36 cm for the female map,  <dig> .58 cm for the male map, and  <dig> .82 cm for the integrated map. the average intervals between two adjacent mapped markers were  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm for three maps, respectively. ‘snp_only’ markers accounted for  <dig>  % of the markers on the integrated map. mapping markers contained  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  loci, which corresponded to two snp loci per slaf marker. according to the integrated map, we used interval mapping  to detect our quantitative trait. one qtl was detected for anthracnose resistance. the interval of this qtl ranged from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm on lg <dig>  and ten markers in this interval that were above the threshold value were considered to be linked markers to the anthracnose resistance trait. the phenotypic variance explained by each marker ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %, and their lod scores varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
high-density genetic maps for walnut containing  <dig> lgs were constructed using the slaf-seq method with an f <dig> population. one qtl for walnut anthracnose resistance was identified based on the map. the results will aid molecular marker-assisted breeding and walnut resistance genes identification.
