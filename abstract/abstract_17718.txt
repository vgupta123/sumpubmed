BACKGROUND
this study assessed the effects of sedation using a combination of fentanyl, midazolam and medetomidine in comparison to ketamine. rhesus macaques ,  received either ketamine   or fentanyl-midazolam-medetomidine   both im. oxygen  was provided by mask and heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etco <dig> and depth of sedation were assessed every 5 min for 20 min. after the last time point, fmm monkeys were reversed with atipamezole-naloxone . recovery was scored using clinical scoring scheme. differences in physiological parameters and quality of sedation were compared using area under the curve  method and either mann-witney or t-student tests.


RESULTS
heart rate  , systolic blood pressure  , and respiratory rate   were significantly lower in the fmm group. end-tidal co <dig>  did not differ between the groups . although some depression of physiological parameters was seen with fmm, the variables all remained within the normal ranges in both groups. onset of a sufficient degree of sedation for safe handling was more rapid with ketamine , but fmm recovery was faster  and of better quality  most probably because of the effectiveness of the reversal agents used.


CONCLUSIONS
fmm provides an easily reversible immobilization with a rapid and good recovery quality and may prove a useful alternative to ketamine.
