BACKGROUND
avian influenza remains a serious threat to human health. the consequence of human infection varies markedly among different subtypes of avian influenza viruses. in addition to viral factors, the difference in host cellular response is likely to play a critical role. this study aims at elucidating how avian influenza infection perturbs the host’s mirna regulatory pathways that may lead to adverse pathological events, such as cytokine storm, using the mirna microarray approach.


RESULTS
the results showed that dysregulation of mirna expression was mainly observed in highly pathogenic avian influenza a h5n <dig> infection. we found that mir-21*, mir-100*, mir- <dig>  mir-574-3p, mir-1274a and mir1274b were differentially expressed in response to influenza a virus infection. interestingly, we demonstrated that mir- <dig>  which was more highly induced by h5n <dig> than by h1n <dig> , had an ability to suppress the expression of a cytokine - transforming growth factor -β <dig>  this was supported by the observation that the inhibitory effect could be reversed by antagomir- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
since tgf-β <dig> is an important cytokine that can act as both an immunosuppressive agent and a potent proinflammatory molecule through its ability to attract and regulate inflammatory molecules, and previous report showed that only seasonal influenza h1n <dig>  could induce a persistent expression of tgf-β <dig>  we speculate that the modulation of tgf-β <dig> expression by different influenza subtypes via mir- <dig> might be a critical step for determining the outcome of either normal or excessive inflammation progression.
