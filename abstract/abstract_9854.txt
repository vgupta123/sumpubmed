BACKGROUND
flagella and cilia are fine thread-like organelles protruding from cells that harbour them. the typical ‘9 + 2’ cilia confer motility on these cells. although the mechanistic details of motility remain elusive, the dynein-driven motility is regulated by various kinases and phosphatases. a-kinase anchoring proteins  are scaffolds that bind to a variety of such proteins. usually, they are known to possess a dedicated domain that in vitro interacts with the regulatory subunits  present in the camp-dependent protein kinase  holoenzyme. these subunits conventionally harbour contiguous stretches of a.a. residues that reveal the presence of the dimerization docking  domain, catalytic interface domain and camp-binding domain. the chlamydomonas reinhardtii flagella harbour two akaps; viz., the radial spoke akap <dig> or rsp <dig> and the central pair akap <dig>  both these were identified on the basis of their rii-binding property. interestingly, akap <dig> binds in vivo to two rii-like proteins  that contain only the d/d domain.


RESULTS
we found a chlamydomonas flagellar associated protein  orthologous to mycbp- <dig>  a protein that binds to organellar akaps and myc onco-protein. an in silico analysis shows that the n-terminus of fap <dig> is similar to those rii domain-containing proteins that have binding affinities to akaps. binding of fap <dig> was tested with the akap97/rsp <dig> using in vitro pull down assays; however, this binding was rather poor with akap97/rsp <dig>  antibodies were generated against fap <dig> and the cellular localization was studied using western blotting and immunoflourescence in wild type and various flagella mutants. we show that fap <dig> localises to the central pair of the axoneme. using overlay assays we show that fap <dig> binds akap <dig> previously identified in the c <dig> portion of the central pair apparatus.


CONCLUSIONS
it appears that the flagella of chlamydomonas reinhardtii contain proteins that bind to akaps and except for the d/d domain, lack the conventional a.a. stretches of pka regulatory subunits . we add fap <dig> to this growing list.
