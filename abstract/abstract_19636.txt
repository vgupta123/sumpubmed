BACKGROUND
cytochrome p <dig> 2s <dig>  is an orphan p <dig> with an unknown biological function. data from our laboratory and others suggest that cyp2s <dig> may have an important physiological role in modulating the synthesis and metabolism of bioactive lipids including prostaglandins and retinoids. cyp2s <dig> expression is elevated in multiple epithelial-derived cancers as well as in the chronic hyperproliferative disease psoriasis. whether cyp2s <dig> expression in proliferative disease is protective, detrimental, or neutral to disease progression remains to be determined. two human bronchial epithelial cells  were constructed to represent chronic depletion of cyp2s <dig> using short-hairpin rna  silencing directed toward the 3â€™utr  and exon  <dig>  of the cyp2s <dig> gene and compared with a non-targeting shrna control . both cyp2s <dig> mrna and protein were depleted by approximately 75% in stable cell lines derived from both targeted shrna constructs . to elucidate the biological significance of cyp2s <dig>  we analyzed transcriptome alterations in response to cyp2s <dig> depletion in human lung cells.


RESULTS
rna-sequencing  analysis was performed to compare the transcriptome of the control  and the cyp2s1-depleted  beas-2b cell lines. transcriptomes of the replicates from the two cell lines were found to be distinct populations as determined using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering. approximately  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in response to cyp2s <dig> depletion. consistent with our previous phenotypes, david analysis revealed altered regulation in key pathways implicated in cell proliferation and migration. transcriptomic profiles were also consistent with the metabolism of proposed endogenous substrates. pathway analysis also revealed significant expression changes within mtor signaling, a critical pathway in cell growth. to determine whether these changes manifest as altered cell size, cell diameter and volume were calculated, revealing that cyp2s <dig> depletion promotes cell growth in beas-2b cells.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that pathway analysis of sequence-based gene expression is a powerful method to identify pathways and phenotypic alterations in response to changes in orphan enzyme expression. our results suggest a novel role for cyp2s1-mediated metabolism in modulating beas-2b cell size. these findings warrant further studies on cyp2s <dig> regulated pathways to elucidate potential substrates of cyp2s <dig>
