BACKGROUND
sweetpotato, ipomoea batatas  lam., is an important food crop widely grown in the world. however, little is known about the genome of this species because it is a highly heterozygous hexaploid. gaining a more in-depth knowledge of sweetpotato genome is therefore necessary and imperative. in this study, the first bacterial artificial chromosome  library of sweetpotato was constructed. clones from the bac library were end-sequenced and analyzed to provide genome-wide information about this species.


RESULTS
the bac library contained  <dig>  clones with an average insert size of  <dig> kb and had a  <dig> – <dig>  × coverage of the genome, and the probability of isolating any single-copy dna sequence from the library was more than 99%. both ends of  <dig> bac clones randomly selected from the library were sequenced to generate  <dig>  high-quality bac-end sequences , with an accumulative length of  <dig> , <dig> bp and an average length of  <dig> bp. analysis of the bess revealed that  <dig> % of the sweetpotato genome were known repetitive dna, including  <dig> % long terminal repeat  retrotransposons,  <dig> % non-ltr retrotransposons and  <dig> % class ii dna transposons etc.,  <dig> % of the genome were identified as sweetpotato-unique repetitive dna and  <dig> % of the genome were predicted to be coding regions. in total,  <dig>  simple sequences repeats  were identified, with a density of one ssr per  <dig>  kb, from which  <dig> ssrs primers were designed and tested for length polymorphism using  <dig> sweetpotato accessions,  <dig>  of them produced polymorphic bands. sweetpotato bess had significant hits to the genome sequences of i. trifida and more matches to the whole-genome sequences of solanum lycopersicum than those of vitis vinifera, theobroma cacao and arabidopsis thaliana.


CONCLUSIONS
the first bac library for sweetpotato has been successfully constructed. the high quality bess provide first insights into sweetpotato genome composition, and have significant hits to the genome sequences of i. trifida and more matches to the whole-genome sequences of solanum lycopersicum. these resources as a robust platform will be used in high-resolution mapping, gene cloning, assembly of genome sequences, comparative genomics and evolution for sweetpotato.
