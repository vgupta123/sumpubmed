BACKGROUND
the tunicate ciona intestinalis , a major model system for evolutionary and developmental genetics of chordates, harbours two cryptic species. to assess the degree of intra- and inter-specific genetic variability, we report the identification and analysis of c. intestinalis snp  markers. a snp subset was used to determine the genetic distance between hox- <dig> and - <dig> genes.


RESULTS
dna fragments were amplified from  <dig> regions of c. intestinalis sp. a. in total,  <dig> snps and  <dig> one bp indels have been identified within  <dig> kb dna. snps in coding regions cause  <dig> synonymous and  <dig> non-synonymous substitutions. the highest snp frequency was detected in the hox <dig> and hox <dig> intragenic regions. in c. intestinalis, these two genes have lost their archetypal topology within the cluster, such that hox <dig> is located between hox <dig> and hox <dig>  a subset of the above primers was used to perform successful amplification in c. intestinalis sp. b. in this cryptic species,  <dig> snps were identified within  <dig> bp:  <dig> in non-coding and  <dig> in coding regions. the genetic distance of the hox- <dig> and - <dig> loci, computed combining a classical backcross approach with the application of snp markers, was found to be  <dig>  cm . based on the physical distance,  <dig> cm corresponds to  <dig>  kb. linkage disequilibrium between the aforementioned loci was calculated in the backcross generation.


CONCLUSIONS
snps here described allow analysis and comparisons within and between c. intestinalis cryptic species. we provide the first reliable computation of genetic distance in this important model chordate. this latter result represents an important platform for future studies on hox genes showing deviations from the archetypal topology.
