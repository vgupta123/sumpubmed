BACKGROUND
recently our group has identified a novel antigen of mycobacterium tuberculosis, protein ppe <dig>  belonging to the "ppe protein" family. although its role in infection is largely unknown, ppe44-specific immune responses were detected in mice infected with m. tuberculosis; moreover, immunization of mice with ppe <dig> subunit vaccines resulted in protective efficacy comparable to the one afforded by bcg against m. tuberculosis .


RESULTS
in the present paper, we investigated anti-ppe <dig> t-lymphocyte responses during human infection by evaluating the frequency of ppe44-specific interferon -γ-secreting cells by elispot and flow cytometry in a small cohort of healthy subjects that had proven positive to ppd  in vitro, in patients with active tuberculosis, in subjects vaccinated with bcg and in unvaccinated, ppd- healthy controls. we showed ifn-γ+ t cell immune responses to recombinant ppe <dig> in at least a very high proportion of ppd+ individuals tested and, to a lower extent, in subjects vaccinated with bcg. by the use of a panel of overlapping synthetic 20-mer peptides spanning the ppe <dig> primary amino acid sequence, we identified a strong cd4+ t-cell epitope, encompassed by peptide p1l , in the nh2-terminus of the ppe <dig> molecule at the amino acid position 1- <dig>  conversely, our experiments did not provide evidence of a significant ifn-γ+ cd4+ t cell response to ppe <dig> or its immunodominant peptide p1l in most  patients with active tb.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest an important immunological role of ppe <dig> and its immunodominant epitope p1l that could be useful in the design of anti-tuberculosis vaccines and in the immunological diagnosis of m. tuberculosis infection.
