BACKGROUND
fibroblast growth factors  are multifunctional proteins that play important roles in cell communication, proliferation and differentiation. however, many aspects of their activities are not well defined. let- <dig>  one of the two c. elegans fgfs, is expressed throughout development and is essential for worm development. it is both expressed in the nucleus and secreted.


RESULTS
to identify nuclear factors associated with let- <dig>  we used three approaches. first, we screened a two-hybrid cdna library derived from mixed stages worms and from a normalized library, using let- <dig> as bait. this direct approach allowed the identification of several binding partners that play various roles in the nucleus/nucleolus, such as pal- <dig>  a transcription regulator, or rps- <dig>  a component of the small ribosomal subunit. the interactions were validated by co-immunoprecipitation and determination of their site of occurrence in mammalian cells. second, because patterns of protein interactions may be conserved throughout species, we searched for orthologs of known mammalian interactors and measured binary interaction with these predicted candidates. we found kin- <dig> and kin- <dig>  the orthologs of ck2α and ck2β, as new partners of let- <dig>  third, following the assumption that recognition motifs mediating protein interaction may be conserved between species, we screened a two-hybrid cdna human library using let- <dig> as bait. among the few fgf partners detected was 14-3-3β. in support of this interaction we showed that the two 14-3-3β orthologous proteins, ftt- <dig> and ftt-2/par- <dig>  interacted with let- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we have conducted the first extensive search for let- <dig> interactors using a multi-directional approach and established the first interaction map of let-756/fgf with other fgf binding proteins from other species. the interactors identified play various roles in developmental process or basic biochemical events such as ribosome biogenesis.
