BACKGROUND
the prophenoloxidase-activating  system plays an important role in the crustacean innate immunity, particularly in wound healing and pathogen defense. a key member of this system is prophenoloxidase-activating enzyme , which is the direct activator of prophenoloxidase . despite their importance in crustacean po activating system, the studies on them remain limited.


RESULTS
here we report on a ppae of white shrimp, litopenaeus vannamei , which showed 94% similarity to ppae <dig> of penaeus monodon. we found that lvppae <dig> in fluid hemocytes was down regulated after challenge by vibrio harveyi but was enhanced when shrimps were exposed to a bacteria-rich environment for long-term. in vivo gene silence of lvppae <dig> by rnai can significantly reduce the phenoloxidase activity  and increase the susceptibility of shrimps to v. harveyi. although lvppae <dig> was down-regulated in fluid hemocytes by vibrio challenge, its expression increased significantly in gill after bacteria injection, which is the primary bacteria-clearance tissue.


CONCLUSIONS
suppressed expression in fluid hemocytes and enhanced expression in gill indicates selectively enhanced expression at the bacterial clearance site. this is a novel feature for ppae expression. the results will contribute to our understanding of the po activating system in crustaceans.
