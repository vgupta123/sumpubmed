BACKGROUND
classical genetic studies provide strong evidence for heritable contributions to susceptibility to developing dependence on addictive substances. candidate gene and genome-wide association studies  have sought genes, chromosomal regions and allelic variants likely to contribute to susceptibility to drug addiction.


RESULTS
here, we performed a meta-analysis of addiction candidate gene association studies and gwas to investigate possible functional mechanisms associated with addiction susceptibility. from meta-data retrieved from  <dig> publications on candidate gene association studies and  <dig> gwas reports, we linked a total of  <dig> haplotypes to addiction susceptibility. we mapped the snps in these haplotypes to functional and regulatory elements in the genome and estimated the magnitude of the contributions of different molecular mechanisms to their effects on addiction susceptibility. in addition to snps in coding regions, these data suggest that haplotypes in gene regulatory regions may also contribute to addiction susceptibility. when we compared the lists of genes identified by association studies and those identified by molecular biological studies of drug-regulated genes, we observed significantly higher participation in the same gene interaction networks than expected by chance, despite little overlap between the two gene lists.


CONCLUSIONS
these results appear to offer new insights into the genetic factors underlying drug addiction.
