BACKGROUND
melon  is a commercially important fruit crop that is cultivated worldwide. the melon research community has recently benefited from the determination of a complete draft genome sequence and the development of associated genomic tools, which have allowed us to focus on small rnas . these are short, non-coding rnas 21- <dig> nucleotides in length with diverse physiological roles. in plants, they regulate gene expression and heterochromatin assembly, and control protection against virus infection. much remains to be learned about the role of srnas in melon.


RESULTS
we constructed  <dig> srna libraries from two stages of developing ovaries, fruits and photosynthetic cotyledons infected with viruses, and carried out high-throughput pyrosequencing. we catalogued and analysed the melon srnas, resulting in the identification of  <dig> known mirna families , the prediction of  <dig> melon-specific mirna candidates, the identification of trans-acting sirnas, and the identification of chloroplast, mitochondrion and transposon-derived srnas. in silico analysis revealed more than  <dig> potential targets for the conserved and novel mirnas.


CONCLUSIONS
we have discovered and analysed a large number of conserved and melon-specific srnas, including mirnas and their potential target genes. this provides insight into the composition and function of the melon small rnaome, and paves the way towards an understanding of srna-mediated processes that regulate melon fruit development and melon-virus interactions.
