BACKGROUND
in water-soluble proteins it is energetically favorable to bury hydrophobic residues and to expose polar and charged residues. in contrast to water soluble proteins, transmembrane proteins face three distinct environments; a hydrophobic lipid environment inside the membrane, a hydrophilic water environment outside the membrane and an interface region rich in phospholipid head-groups. therefore, it is energetically favorable for transmembrane proteins to expose different types of residues in the different regions.


RESULTS
investigations of a set of structurally determined transmembrane proteins showed that the composition of solvent exposed residues differs significantly inside and outside the membrane. in contrast, residues buried within the interior of a protein show a much smaller difference. however, in all regions exposed residues are less conserved than buried residues. further, we found that current state-of-the-art predictors for surface area are optimized for one of the regions and perform badly in the other regions. to circumvent this limitation we developed a new predictor, mprap, that performs well in all regions. in addition, mprap performs better on complete membrane proteins than a combination of specialized predictors and acceptably on water-soluble proteins. a web-server of mprap is available at http://mprap.cbr.su.se/


CONCLUSIONS
by including complete a-helical transmembrane proteins in the training mprap is able to predict surface accessibility accurately both inside and outside the membrane. this predictor can aid in the prediction of 3d-structure, and in the identification of erroneous protein structures.
