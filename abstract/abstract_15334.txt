BACKGROUND
many plant genes have been identified through whole genome and deep transcriptome sequencing and other methods; yet our knowledge on the function of many of these genes remains limited. the integration and analysis of large gene-expression datasets gives researchers the ability to formalize hypotheses concerning the functionality and interaction between different groups of correlated genes.


RESULTS
we applied the non-negative matrix factorization  algorithm to the atgenexpress dataset which consists of  <dig> microarray samples  conducted on the model plant arabidopsis thaliana. we identified  <dig> metagenes, which are groups of genes with correlated expression. functional roles of these metagenes are established by observing the enriched gene ontology  categories using gene set enrichment analyses . activity levels of these metagenes in various experimental conditions are also analyzed to associate metagenes with stimuli/conditions. a metagene correlation network, constructed based on the results of nmf analysis, revealed many new interactions between the metagenes. comparison of these metagenes with an earlier large-scale clustering analysis indicates many statistically significant overlaps.


CONCLUSIONS
this study identifies a network of correlated metagenes composed of arabidopsis genes acting in a highly correlated fashion across a broad spectrum of experimental stimuli, which may shed some light on the function of many of the un-annotated genes.
