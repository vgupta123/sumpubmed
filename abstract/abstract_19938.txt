BACKGROUND
most living cells uptake phosphate, an indispensable nutrient for growth from their natural environment. in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  the cells lack phosphate-inorganic transport  system but contain two phosphate-specific transport  systems, pst <dig> and pst <dig>  we investigated the kinetics of pi uptake of these two pst systems by constructing the two mutants, Δpst <dig> and Δpst <dig>  and comparing their kinetic properties with those of the wild-type cells under both pi-sufficient and deficient conditions. the effects of ph and na+ on the uptake of phosphate in synechocystis were also studied.


RESULTS
growth rates of the two mutants and wild type were similar either under phosphate-sufficient or deficient condition. the km for phosphate uptake was  <dig>  μm in wild type and this was reduced to  <dig>  μm in Δpst <dig> cells and  <dig>  μm in the Δpst <dig> strain. the vmax values of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μmol • - <dig> were obtained for wild type, the Δpst <dig> and Δpst <dig> strains, respectively. a monophasic phosphate uptake was observed in wild-type cells. the uptake of phosphate was energy and ph-dependent with a broad ph optimum between ph 7- <dig>  osmolality imposed by nacl stimulated phosphate uptake whereas that imposed by sorbitol decreased uptake, suggesting stimulation of uptake was dependent upon ionic effects.


CONCLUSIONS
the data demonstrate that pst <dig> system of synechocystis has higher affinity toward phosphate with lower vmax than pst <dig> system. the pst <dig> system had similar km and vmax values to those of the wild type suggesting that pst <dig> is the main phosphate transporter in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  the km of pst <dig> of synechocystis is closer to that of pit system than to that of the pst system of e. coli, suggesting that synechocystis pst <dig> is rather a medium/low affinity transporter whereas pst <dig> is a high affinity transporter.
