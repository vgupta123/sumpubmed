BACKGROUND
the human immunodeficiency virus  is a retrovirus causing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome , which has become a serious problem across the world and has no cure reported to date. human immunodeficiency virus  protease is an attractive target for antiviral treatment and a number of therapeutically useful inhibitors have been designed against it. the emergence of drug resistant mutants of hiv- <dig> poses a serious problem for conventional therapies that have been used so far. until now, thirteen protease inhibitors , major mutation sites and many secondary mutations have been listed in the hiv drug resistance database. in this study, we have studied the effect of the v77i mutation in hiv-pr along with the co-occurring mutations l33f and k20t through multi-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations. v77i is known to cause nelfinavir  resistance in the subtype b population of hiv- <dig> protease. we have for the first time reported the effect of this clinically relevant mutation on the binding of nelfinavir and the conformational flexibility of the protease.


RESULTS
two hiv-pr mutants have been considered in this study - the double mutant protease  v77i-l33f and triple mutant protease  v77i-k20t-l33f. the molecular dynamics simulation studies were carried out and the rmsd trajectories of the unliganded wild type and mutated protease were found to be stable. the binding affinity of nfv with wild type hiv-pr was very high with a glide xp docking score of - <dig>  kcal/mol. nfv showed decreased affinity towards dbm with a docking score of - <dig>  kcal/mol, whereas its affinity increased towards tpm . prime/mm-gbsa binding free energy of the wild type, dbm and tpm hiv-pr docked structures were calculated as - <dig> , - <dig>  and - <dig>  kcal/mol respectively. the binding site cavity volumes of wild type, dbm and tpm protease were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  Ã… <dig> respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have studied the structural roles of the two hiv-pr mutations by conducting molecular dynamics simulation studies of the wild type and mutant hiv- <dig> prs. the present study proposes that dbm protease showed greater flexibility and the flap separation was greater with respect to the wild type protease. the cavity size of the md-stabilized dbm was also found to be increased, which may be responsible for the decreased interaction of nelfinavir with the cavity residues, thus explaining the decreased binding affinity. on the other hand, the binding affinity of nfv for tpm was found to be enhanced, accounted for by the decrease in cavity size of the mutant which facilitated strong interactions with the flap residues. the flap separation of tpm was less than the wild type protease and the decreased cavity size may be responsible for its lower resistance, and hence, may be the reason for its lower clinical relevance.
