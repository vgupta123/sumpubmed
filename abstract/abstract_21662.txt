BACKGROUND
proton currents are required for optimal respiratory burst in phagocytes. recently, hvcn <dig> was identified as the molecule required for the voltage-gated proton channel activity associated with the respiratory burst in neutrophils. although there are similarities between eosinophils and neutrophils regarding their mechanism for respiratory burst, the role of proton channels in eosinophil functions has not been fully understood.


RESULTS
in the present study, we first identified the expression of the proton channel hvcn <dig> in mouse eosinophils. furthermore, using hvcn1-deficient eosinophils, we demonstrated important cell-specific effector functions for hvcn <dig>  similar to hvcn1-deficient neutrophils, hvcn1-deficient eosinophils produced significantly less reactive oxygen species  upon phorbol myristate acetate  stimulation compared with wt eosinophils. in contrast to hvcn1-deficient neutrophils, hvcn1-deficient eosinophils did not show impaired calcium mobilization or migration ability compared with wild-type  cells. uniquely, hvcn1-deficient eosinophils underwent significantly increased cell death induced by pma stimulation compared with wt eosinophils. the increased cell death was dependent on nadph oxidase activation, and correlated with the failure of hvcn1-deficient cells to maintain membrane polarization and intracellular ph in the physiological range upon activation.


CONCLUSIONS
eosinophils require proton channel hvcn <dig> for optimal ros generation and prevention of activation-induced cell death.
