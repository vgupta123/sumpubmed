BACKGROUND
mycobacterium tuberculosis  is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. to combat against this pathogen, immune cells release cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α , which is pivotal in the development of protective granulomas. our previous results showed that bacillus calmette guerin , a mycobacterium used as a model to investigate the immune response against mtb, stimulates the induction of tnf-α via mitogen-activated protein kinase  in human blood monocytes. since mapk phosphatase- <dig>  is known to regulate mapk activities, we examined whether mkp- <dig> plays a role in bcg-induced mapk activation and cytokine expression.


RESULTS
primary human blood monocytes were treated with bcg and assayed for mkp- <dig> expression. our results demonstrated that following exposure to bcg, there was an increase in the expression of mkp- <dig>  additionally, the induction of mkp- <dig> was regulated by p <dig> mapk and extracellular signal-regulated kinase  <dig> and  <dig> . surprisingly, when mkp- <dig> expression was blocked by its specific sirna, there was a significant decrease in the levels of phospho-mapk  and tnf-α inducible by bcg.


CONCLUSIONS
since tnf-α is pivotal in granuloma formation, the results indicated an unexpected positive function of mkp- <dig> against mycobacterial infection as opposed to its usual phosphatase activity.
