BACKGROUND
structural changes have been found predominantly in the frontal cortex and in the striatum in children and adolescents with gilles de la tourette syndrome . the influence of comorbid symptomatology is unclear. here we sought to address the question of gray matter abnormalities in gts patients with co-morbid obsessive-compulsive disorder  and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  using voxel-based morphometry  in twenty-nine adult actually unmedicated gts patients and twenty-five healthy control subjects.


RESULTS
in gts we detected a cluster of decreased gray matter volume in the left inferior frontal gyrus , but no regions demonstrating volume increases. by comparing subgroups of gts with comorbid adhd to the subgroup with comorbid ocd, we found a left-sided amygdalar volume increase.


CONCLUSIONS
from our results it is suggested that the left ifg may constitute a common underlying structural correlate of gts with co-morbid ocd/adhd. a volume reduction in this brain region that has been previously identified as a key region in ocd and was associated with the active inhibition of attentional processes may reflect the failure to control behavior. amygdala volume increase is discussed on the background of a linkage of this structure with adhd symptomatology. correlations with clinical data revealed gray matter volume changes in specific brain areas that have been described in these conditions each.
