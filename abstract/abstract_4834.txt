BACKGROUND
the occurrence of paratuberculosis in ugandan cattle has recently been reported but there is no information on the strains of mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis  responsible for the disease. the aim of this study was to isolate and characterise map from seropositive cattle and paratuberculosis lesions in tissues obtained from slaughtered cattle in uganda.


RESULTS
twenty one isolates of map were differentiated into  <dig> genotype profiles using seven genotyping loci consisting of insertion sequence  <dig>  mycobacterial interspersed repeat units  , variable number tandem repeats  locus  <dig> and short sequence repeats  . three different is <dig> types and three miru  <dig> profiles  were observed. two allelic variants were found based on miru  <dig> , while vntr  <dig> showed no polymorphism in any of the isolates from which it was successfully amplified. ssr locus  <dig> revealed  <dig> and 7 g <dig> repeats among the isolates whereas ssr locus  <dig> revealed  <dig>   <dig> and 12 g <dig> repeats. ssr locus  <dig> was the most polymorphic locus. phylogenetic analysis of ssr locus  <dig> sequences based on their single nucleotide polymorphisms separated the isolates into  <dig> genotypes. we found that the use of ethylene glycol as a pcr additive improved the efficiency of the pcr reactions for mirus , vntr  <dig> and ssr .


CONCLUSIONS
there is a high strain diversity of map in uganda since  <dig> isolates could be classified into  <dig> genotypes. the combination of the seven loci used in this study results into a very precise discrimination of isolates. however analysis of snps on locus alone  <dig> is very close to this combination. most of the genotypes in this study are novel since they differed in one or more loci from other isolates of cattle origin in different studies. the large number of map strains within a relatively small area of the country implies that the epidemiology of paratuberculosis in uganda may be complicated and needs further investigation. finally, the use of ethylene glycol as a pcr additive increases the efficiency of pcr amplification of difficult templates.
