BACKGROUND
our recent study showed the global physiological function of the differentially expressed genes of prostate cancer in chinese patients was different from that of other non-chinese populations. microrna are estimated to regulate the expression of greater than 60% of all protein-coding genes. to further investigate the global association between the transcript abundance of mirnas and their target mrnas in chinese patients, we used microrna microarray approach combined with bioinformatics and clinical-pathological assay to investigate the mirna profile and evaluate the potential of mirnas as diagnostic and prognostic markers in chinese patients.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> mirnas  were differentially expressed between tumor tissue and adjacent benign tissue of  <dig> prostate cancer patients. <dig> top differentially expressed mirnas were validated by qrt-pcr using all  <dig> tissue pairs. compared to the mirna profile of non-chinese populations, the current study showed that mir-23b, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> maybe common critical therapeutic targets in different populations. the integrated analysis for mrna microarray and mirna microarray showed the effects of specifically inhibiting and/or enhancing the function of mirnas on the gene transcription level. the current studies also identified  <dig> specific expressed mirnas in chinese patients. the clinical feature statistics revealed that mir-374b and mir-19a have significant correlations with clinical-pathological features in chinese patients.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings showed chinese prostate cancer patients have a common and specific mirna expression profile compared with non-chinese populations. the mir-374b is down-regulated in prostate cancer tissue, and it can be identified as an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence-free survival.
