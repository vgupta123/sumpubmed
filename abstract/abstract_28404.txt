BACKGROUND
in the anaerobic pathway of cobalamin  synthesis, the cbit enzyme plays two roles, as a cobalt-precorrin- <dig> c15-methyltransferase and a c12-decarboxylase, to produce the intermediate, cobalt-precorrin  <dig> 


RESULTS
the primary structure of the hypothetical protein mj <dig>  from methanocaldococcus jannaschii, suggested that mj <dig> is a putative cbit. here, we report the crystal structure of mj <dig>  solved by the mad procedure and refined to final r-factor and r-free values of  <dig>  &  <dig> %, respectively, at  <dig>  Ã… resolution. the asymmetric unit contains two ncs molecules, and the intact tetramer generated by crystallographic symmetry may be functionally important. the overall tertiary structure and the tetrameric arrangements are highly homologous to those found in mt0146/cbit from methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum.


CONCLUSIONS
the conservation of functional residues in the binding site for the co-factor, adomet, and in the putative precorrin- <dig> binding pocket suggested that mj <dig> may also possess cbit activity. the putative function of mj <dig> is discussed, based on structural homology.
