BACKGROUND
the amyloid precursor protein  is cleaved by β- and γ-secretases to generate toxic amyloid β  peptides. alternatively, α-secretases cleave app within the aβ domain, precluding aβ formation and releasing the soluble ectodomain, sappα. we previously showed that inhibition of the gtpase dynamin reduced app internalization and increased release of sappα, apparently by prolonging the interaction between app and α-secretases at the plasma membrane. this was accompanied by a reduction in aβ generation. in the present study, we investigated whether surface expression of the α-secretase adam  <dig> is also regulated by dynamin-dependent endocytosis.


RESULTS
transfection of human embryonic kidney  cells stably expressing m <dig> muscarinic receptors with a dominant negative dynamin i mutant , increased surface expression of both immature, and mature, catalytically active forms of co-expressed adam <dig>  surface levels of adam <dig> were unaffected by activation of protein kinase c  or m <dig> receptors, indicating that receptor-coupled shedding of the adam substrate app is unlikely to be mediated by inhibition of adam <dig> endocytosis in this cell line. dyn i k44a strongly increased the formation of a c-terminal fragment of adam <dig>  consistent with earlier reports that the adam <dig> ectodomain is itself a target for sheddases. the abundance of this fragment was increased in the presence of a γ-secretase inhibitor, but was not affected by m <dig> receptor activation. the dynamin mutant did not affect the distribution of adam <dig> and its c-terminal fragment between raft and non-raft membrane compartments.


CONCLUSIONS
surface expression and limited proteolysis of adam <dig> are regulated by dynamin-dependent endocytosis, but are unaffected by activation of signaling pathways that upregulate shedding of adam substrates such as app. modulation of adam <dig> internalization could affect cellular behavior in two ways: by altering the putative signaling activity of the adam <dig> c-terminal fragment, and by regulating the biological function of adam <dig> substrates such as app and n-cadherin.
