BACKGROUND
life-long production of spermatozoa depends on spermatogonial stem cells. spermatogonial stem cells exist among the most primitive population of germ cells â€“ undifferentiated spermatogonia. transplantation experiments have demonstrated the functional heterogeneity of undifferentiated spermatogonia. although the undifferentiated spermatogonia can be topographically divided into as , apr , and aal  spermatogonia, subdivision of this primitive cell population using cytological markers would greatly facilitate characterization of their functions.


RESULTS
in the present study, we show that lin <dig>  a pluripotency factor, is specifically expressed in undifferentiated spermatogonia  in mouse. ngn <dig> also specifically labels undifferentiated spermatogonia. we used ngn3-gfp knockin mice, in which gfp expression is under the control of all ngn <dig> transcription regulatory elements. remarkably, ngn3-gfp is only expressed in ~40% of lin28-positive as  cells. the percentage of ngn3-gfp-positive clusters increases dramatically with the chain length of interconnected spermatogonia.


CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates that lin <dig> specifically marks undifferentiated spermatogonia in mice. these data, together with previous studies, suggest that the lin28-expressing undifferentiated spermatogonia exist as two subpopulations: ngn3-gfp-negative  and ngn3-gfp-positive . furthermore, ngn3-gfp-negative cells are found in chains of ngn3-gfp-positive spermatogonia, suggesting that cells in the aal spermatogonia could revert to a more primitive state.
