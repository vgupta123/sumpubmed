BACKGROUND
the endoplasmic reticulum  is a major signaling organelle, which integrates a variety of responses against physiological stresses. in plants, one such stress-integrating response is the n-rich protein -mediated cell death signaling pathway, which is synergistically activated by combined er stress and osmotic stress signals. despite the potential of this integrated signaling to protect plant cells against different stress conditions, mechanistic knowledge of the pathway is lacking, and downstream components have yet to be identified.


RESULTS
in the present investigation, we discovered an nac domain-containing protein from soybean, gmnac <dig> , to be a downstream component of the integrated pathway. similar to nrp-a and nrp-b, gmnac <dig> is induced by er stress and osmotic stress individually, but requires both signals for full activation. transient expression of gmnac <dig> promoted cell death and hypersensitive-like responses in planta. gmnac <dig> and nrps also share overlapping responses to biotic signals, but the induction of nrps peaked before the increased accumulation of gmnac <dig> transcripts. consistent with the delayed kinetics of gmnac <dig> induction, increased levels of nrp-a and nrp-b transcripts induced promoter activation and the expression of the gmnac <dig> gene.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our results biochemically link gmnac <dig> to the er stress- and osmotic stress-integrating cell death response and show that gmnac <dig> may act downstream of the nrps.
