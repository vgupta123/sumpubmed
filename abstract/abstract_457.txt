BACKGROUND
studies of gene expression in post mortem human brain can contribute to understanding of the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, including alzheimer's disease , parkinson's disease  and dementia with lewy bodies . quantitative real-time pcr  is often used to analyse gene expression. the validity of results obtained using rt qpcr is reliant on accurate data normalization. reference genes are generally used to normalize rt qpcr data. given that expression of some commonly used reference genes is altered in certain conditions, this study aimed to establish which reference genes were stably expressed in post mortem brain tissue from individuals with ad, pd or dlb.


RESULTS
the present study investigated the expression stability of  <dig> candidate reference genes,  in cerebellum and medial temporal gyrus of  <dig> ad,  <dig> pd,  <dig> dlb subjects, along with  <dig> matched controls using rt qpcr . gene expression stability was analysed using genorm to rank the candidate genes in order of decreasing stability in each disease group. the optimal number of genes recommended for accurate data normalization in each disease state was determined by pairwise variation analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
this study identified validated sets of mrnas which would be appropriate for the normalization of rt qpcr data when studying gene expression in brain tissue of ad, pd, dlb and control subjects.
