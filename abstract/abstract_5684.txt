BACKGROUND
myanmar is the largest country in mainland southeast asia with a population of  <dig> million people subdivided into more than  <dig> ethnic groups. ruled by changing kingdoms and dynasties and lying on the trade route between india and china, myanmar was influenced by numerous cultures. since its independence from british occupation, tensions between the ruling bamar and ethnic minorities increased.


RESULTS
our aim was to search for genetic footprints of myanmarâ€™s geographic, historic and sociocultural characteristics and to contribute to the picture of human colonization by describing and dating of new mitochondrial dna  haplogroups. therefore, we sequenced the mtdna control region of  <dig> unrelated donors and the complete mitochondrial genome of  <dig> selected individuals according to highest quality standards.


CONCLUSIONS
phylogenetic analyses of the entire mtdna genomes uncovered eight new haplogroups and three unclassified basal m-lineages. the multi-ethnic population and the complex history of myanmar were reflected in its mtdna heterogeneity. population genetic analyses of burmese control region sequences combined with population data from neighboring countries revealed that the myanmar haplogroup distribution showed a typical southeast asian pattern, but also northeast asian and indian influences. the population structure of the extraordinarily diverse bamar differed from that of the karen people who displayed signs of genetic isolation. migration analyses indicated a considerable genetic exchange with an overall positive migration balance from myanmar to neighboring countries. age estimates of the newly described haplogroups point to the existence of evolutionary windows where climatic and cultural changes gave rise to mitochondrial haplogroup diversification in asia.
