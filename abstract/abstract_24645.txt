BACKGROUND
insulin-like growth factor- <dig>  is a polypeptide growth factor with a variety of functions in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. igf- <dig> plays anti-apoptotic and other functions by activating multiple signaling pathways including akt kinase, a serine/threonine kinase essential for cell survival. the nuclear transcription factor camp response element-binding protein  may also be involved although relationships between these two proteins in igf- <dig> receptor signaling and protection is not clear, especially in neuronal cells.


RESULTS
igf- <dig>  in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, induces the activation/phosphorylation of akt and creb in pc <dig> cells by activating different signaling pathways. igf- <dig> induced a sustained phosphorylation of akt while only a transient one was seen for creb. the phosphorylation of akt is mediated by the pi <dig> kinase pathway while that of creb is dependent on the activation of both mapk kinase and p <dig> mapk. moreover, the stimulation of pkc attenuated the phosphorylation of akt induced by igf- <dig> while enhancing that of creb. survival assays with various kinase inhibitors suggested that the activation/phosphorylation of both akt and creb contributes to igf- <dig> mediated cell survival in pc <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that igf- <dig> induced the activation of akt and creb using distinct pathways in pc <dig> cells.
