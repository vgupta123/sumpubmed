BACKGROUND
current network-based microarray analysis uses the information of interactions among concerned genes/gene products, but still considers each gene expression individually. we propose an organized knowledge-supervised approach - integrative expression profiling , to improve microarray classification accuracy, and help discover groups of genes that have been too weak to detect individually by traditional ways. to implement ixp, ant colony optimization reordering  algorithm is used to group functionally related genes in an ordered way.


RESULTS
using alzheimer's disease  as an example, we demonstrate how to apply acor-based ixp approach into microarray classifications. using a microarray dataset - gse <dig> with  <dig> samples as training set, the result for the blinded classification on another microarray dataset - gse <dig> with  <dig> samples, shows that our approach can improve accuracy from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. a recently-published 1372-probe signature for ad can only achieve  <dig> % accuracy in the same condition. the acor-based ixp approach also has better performance than the ixp approach based on classic network ranking, graph clustering, and random-ordering methods in an overall classification performance comparison.


CONCLUSIONS
the acor-based ixp approach can serve as a knowledge-supervised feature transformation approach to increase classification accuracy dramatically, by transforming each gene expression profile to an integrated expression files as features inputting into standard classifiers. the ixp approach integrates both gene expression information and organized knowledge - disease gene/protein network topology information, which is represented as both network node weights  and network node orders .
