BACKGROUND
alexithymia is a personality trait that is characterized by difficulties in identifying and describing feelings. previous studies have shown that alexithymia is related to problems in recognizing others’ emotional facial expressions when these are presented with temporal constraints. these problems can be less severe when the expressions are visible for a relatively long time. because the neural correlates of these recognition deficits are still relatively unexplored, we investigated the labeling of facial emotions and brain responses to facial emotions as a function of alexithymia.


RESULTS
forty-eight healthy participants had to label the emotional expression  of faces presented for  <dig> or 3 seconds in a forced-choice format while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. the participants’ level of alexithymia was assessed using self-report and interview. in light of the previous findings, we focused our analysis on the alexithymia component of difficulties in describing feelings. difficulties describing feelings, as assessed by the interview, were associated with increased reaction times for negative  faces, but not with labeling accuracy. moreover, individuals with higher alexithymia showed increased brain activation in the somatosensory cortex and supplementary motor area  in response to angry and fearful faces. these cortical areas are known to be involved in the simulation of the bodily  components of facial emotions.


CONCLUSIONS
the present data indicate that alexithymic individuals may use information related to bodily actions rather than affective states to understand the facial expressions of other persons.
