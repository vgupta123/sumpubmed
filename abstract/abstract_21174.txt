BACKGROUND
the glycogen synthase kinase  <dig> /shaggy-like kinases  are non-receptor serine/threonine protein kinases that are involved in a variety of biological processes. in contrast to the two members of the gsk <dig> family in mammals, plants appear to have a much larger set of divergent gsk genes. plant gsks are encoded by a multigene family; analysis of the arabidopsis genome revealed the existence of  <dig> gsk genes that fall into four major groups. here we characterized the structure of arabidopsis and rice gsk genes and conducted the first broad phylogenetic analysis of the plant gsk gene family, covering a taxonomically diverse array of algal and land plant sequences.


RESULTS
we found that the structure of gsk genes is generally conserved in arabidopsis and rice, although we documented examples of exon expansion and intron loss. our phylogenetic analyses of  <dig> sequences revealed four major clades of gsk genes that correspond to the four subgroups initially recognized in arabidopsis. ests from basal angiosperms were represented in all four major clades; gsk homologs from the basal angiosperm persea americana  appeared in all four clades. gymnosperm sequences occurred in clades i, iii, and iv, and a sequence of the red alga porphyra was sister to all green plant sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that  the plant-specific gsk gene lineage was established early in the history of green plants,  plant gsks began to diversify prior to the origin of extant seed plants,  three of the four major clades of gsks present in arabidopsis and rice were established early in the evolutionary history of extant seed plants, and  diversification into four major clades  occurred either just prior to the origin of the angiosperms or very early in angiosperm history.
