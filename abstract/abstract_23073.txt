BACKGROUND
micrornas play important roles in the adaptive responses of plants to nutrient deficiencies. most research, however, has focused on nitrogen , phosphorus , sulfur , copper  and iron  deficiencies, limited data are available on the differential expression of mirnas and their target genes in response to deficiencies of other nutrient elements. in this study, we identified the known and novel mirnas as well as the boron -deficiency-responsive mirnas from citrus leaves in order to obtain the potential mirnas related to the tolerance of citrus to b-deficiency.

methods
seedlings of ‘xuegan’  were supplied every other day with b-deficient  or -sufficient  nutrient solution for  <dig> weeks. thereafter, we sequenced two small rna libraries from b-deficient and -sufficient  citrus leaves, respectively, using illumina sequencing.


RESULTS
ninety one  up- and  <dig>  down-regulated mirnas were isolated from b-deficient leaves. the great alteration of mirna expression might contribute to the tolerance of citrus to b-deficiency. the adaptive responses of mirnas to b-deficiency might related to several aspects:  attenuation of plant growth and development by repressing auxin signaling due to decreased tir <dig> level and arf-mediated gene expression by altering the expression of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir3946;  maintaining leaf phenotype and enhancing the stress tolerance by up-regulating nacs targeted by mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir7539;  activation of the stress responses and antioxidant system through down-regulating the expression of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir3446;  decreasing the expression of major facilitator superfamily protein genes targeted by mir <dig>  thus lowering b export from plants. also, b-deficiency-induced down-regulation of mir <dig> might play a role in plant tolerance to b-deficiency by regulating cu homeostasis and enhancing superoxide dismutase activity.


CONCLUSIONS
our study reveals some novel responses of citrus to b-deficiency, which increase our understanding of the adaptive mechanisms of citrus to b-deficiency at the mirna  level.
