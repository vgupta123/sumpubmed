BACKGROUND
chloride intracellular channel  <dig>  is one of seven members in the closely related clic protein family. clic <dig> is involved in multiple cellular processes including apoptosis, cellular differentiation, inflammation and endothelial tubulogenesis. despite over a decade of research, no comprehensive in situ expression analysis of clic <dig> in a living organism has been reported. in order to fulfill this goal, we generated a knock-in mouse to express green fluorescent protein  from the clic <dig> locus, thus substituting the gfp coding region for clic <dig>  we used gfp protein expression to eliminate cross reaction with other clic family members.


RESULTS
we analyzed clic <dig> expression during embryonic development and adult organs. during mid and late gestation, clic <dig> expression is modulated particularly in fetal brain, heart, thymus, liver and kidney as well as in developing brown adipose tissue and stratifying epidermis. in the adult mouse, clic <dig> is highly expressed globally in vascular endothelial cells as well as in liver, lung alveolar septae, pancreatic acini, spermatogonia, renal proximal tubules, cardiomyocytes and thymic epithelial cells. neural expression included axonal tracks, olfactory bulb, purkinje cell layer and dentate gyrus. renal clic <dig> expression was most pronounced in proximal tubules, although altered renal function was not detected in the absence of clic <dig>  myeloid cells and b cells of the spleen are rich in clic <dig> expression as are cd <dig> and cd <dig> positive t cells.


CONCLUSIONS
in a comprehensive study detailing clic <dig> expression in situ in a mouse model that excludes cross reaction with other family members, we were able to document previously unreported expression for clic <dig> in developing fetus, particularly the brain. in addition, compartmentalized expression of clic <dig> in specific adult tissues and cells provides a focus to explore potential functions of this protein not addressed previously.
