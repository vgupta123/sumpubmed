BACKGROUND
protein structure mediates site-specific patterns of sequence divergence. in particular, residues in the core of a protein  tend to be more evolutionarily conserved than residues on the surface .


RESULTS
here, we present a model of sequence evolution that explicitly accounts for the relative solvent accessibility of each residue in a protein. our model is a variant of the goldman-yang  <dig>  model in which all model parameters can be functions of the relative solvent accessibility  of a residue. we apply this model to a data set comprised of nearly  <dig> yeast genes, and find that an evolutionary-rate ratio ω that varies linearly with rsa provides a better model fit than an rsa-independent ω or an ω that is estimated separately in individual rsa bins. we further show that the branch length t and the transition-transverion ratio κ also vary with rsa. the rsa-dependent gy <dig> model performs better than an rsa-dependent muse-gaut  <dig>  model in which the synonymous and non-synonymous rates individually are linear functions of rsa. finally, protein core size affects the slope of the linear relationship between ω and rsa, and gene expression level affects both the intercept and the slope.


CONCLUSIONS
structure-aware models of sequence evolution provide a significantly better fit than traditional models that neglect structure. the linear relationship between ω and rsa implies that genes are better characterized by their ω slope and intercept than by just their mean ω.
