BACKGROUND
plant viral vectors offer high-yield expression of pharmaceutical and commercially important proteins with a minimum of cost and preparation time. the use of agrobacterium tumefaciens has been introduced to deliver the viral vector as a transgene to each plant cell via a simple, nonsterile infiltration technique called "agroinoculation". with agroinoculation, a full length, systemically moving virus is no longer necessary for excellent protein yield, since the viral transgene is transcribed and replicates in every infiltrated cell. viral genes may therefore be deleted to decrease the potential for accidental spread and persistence of the viral vector in the environment.


RESULTS
in this study, both the coat protein  and triple gene block  genetic segments were eliminated from foxtail mosaic virus to create the "fect" vector series, comprising a deletion of 29% of the genome. this viral vector is highly crippled and expresses little or no marker gene within the inoculated leaf. however, when co-agroinoculated with a silencing suppressor , fect expressed gfp at 40% total soluble protein in the tobacco host, nicotiana benthamiana. the modified fomv vector retained the full-length replicase orf, the tgb <dig> subgenomic rna leader sequence and either  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> bases of tgb <dig> orf . as well as n. benthamiana, infection of legumes was demonstrated. despite many attempts, expression of gfp via syringe agroinoculation of various grass species was very low, reflecting the low agrobacterium-mediated transformation rate of monocots.


CONCLUSIONS
the fect/ <dig> vector expresses foreign genes at a very high level, and yet has a greatly reduced biohazard potential. it can form no virions and can effectively replicate only in a plant with suppressed silencing.
