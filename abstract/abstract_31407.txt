BACKGROUND
autophagy is an inducible autodigestive process that allows cells to recycle proteins and other materials for survival during stress and nutrient deprived conditions. the kinase ulk <dig> is required to activate this process. ulk <dig> phosphorylates a number of target proteins and regulates many cellular processes including the early secretory pathway. recently, ulk <dig> has been demonstrated to phosphorylate sec <dig> and affects the transport of serotonin transporter at the er exit sites , but whether ulk <dig> may affect the transport of other cargo proteins and general secretion has not been fully addressed.


RESULTS
in this study, we identified sec23a, a component of the copii vesicle coat, as a target of ulk <dig> phosphorylation. elevated autophagy, induced by amino acid starvation, rapamycin, or overexpression of ulk <dig> caused aggregation of the eres, a region of the er dedicated for the budding of copii vesicles. transport of cargo proteins was also inhibited under these conditions and was retained at the eres. ulk <dig> phosphorylation of sec23a reduced the interaction between sec23a and sec31a. we identified serine  <dig>  serine  <dig> and threonine  <dig> on sec23a as ulk <dig> phosphorylation sites. among these residues, serine  <dig>  when changed to phospho-deficient and phospho-mimicking mutants, most faithfully recapitulated the above-mentioned effects of ulk <dig> phospho-regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings identify sec23a as a new target of ulk <dig> and uncover a mechanism of coordinating intracellular protein transport and autophagy.
