BACKGROUND
in italy, anthrax is endemic but occurs sporadically. during the summer of  <dig>  in the pollino national park, basilicata, southern italy, an anthrax epidemic consisting of  <dig> outbreaks occurred; it claimed the lives of  <dig> animals belonging to different mammal species. this study is a retrospective molecular epidemiological investigation carried out on  <dig> isolates collected during the epidemic. a 25-loci multiple locus vntr analysis  mlva was initially performed to define genetic relationships, followed by an investigation of genetic diversity between epidemic strains through single nucleotide repeat  analysis.


RESULTS
 <dig> bacillus anthracis strains were isolated. the 25-loci mlva analysis identified all of them as belonging to a single genotype, while the snr analysis was able to detect the existence of five subgenotypes , allowing a detailed epidemic investigation. sgt- <dig> was the most frequent ; sgts  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  were detected in the remaining seven isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
the analysis revealed the prevalent spread, during this epidemic, of a single anthrax clone. sgt- <dig> - widely distributed across the epidemic area and present throughout the period in question - may, thus, be the ancestral form. sgts  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> differed from sgt- <dig> at only one locus, suggesting that they could have evolved directly from the latter during the course of this epidemic. sgt- <dig> differed from the other sgts at 2- <dig> loci. this isolate, thus, appears to be more distantly related to sgt- <dig> and may not be a direct descendant of the lineage responsible for the majority of cases in this epidemic. these data confirm the importance of molecular typing and subtyping methods for in-depth epidemiological analyses of anthrax epidemics.
