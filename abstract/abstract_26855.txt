BACKGROUND
several data mining methods require data that are discrete, and other methods often perform better with discrete data. we introduce an efficient bayesian discretization  method for optimal discretization of variables that runs efficiently on high-dimensional biomedical datasets. the ebd method consists of two components, namely, a bayesian score to evaluate discretizations and a dynamic programming search procedure to efficiently search the space of possible discretizations. we compared the performance of ebd to fayyad and irani's  discretization method, which is commonly used for discretization.


RESULTS
on  <dig> biomedical datasets obtained from high-throughput transcriptomic and proteomic studies, the classification performances of the c <dig>  classifier and the na√Øve bayes classifier were statistically significantly better when the predictor variables were discretized using ebd over fi. ebd was statistically significantly more stable to the variability of the datasets than fi. however, ebd was less robust, though not statistically significantly so, than fi and produced slightly more complex discretizations than fi.


CONCLUSIONS
on a range of biomedical datasets, a bayesian discretization method  yielded better classification performance and stability but was less robust than the widely used fi discretization method. the ebd discretization method is easy to implement, permits the incorporation of prior knowledge and belief, and is sufficiently fast for application to high-dimensional data.
