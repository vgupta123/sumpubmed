BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars typhimurium  and heidelberg  are major causes of foodborne salmonellosis, accounting for a fifth of all annual salmonellosis cases in the united states. rapid, efficient and accurate methods for identification are required for routine surveillance and to track specific strains during outbreaks. we used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  and a recently developed molecular subtyping approach termed crispr-mvlst that exploits the hypervariable nature of virulence genes and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  to subtype clinical s. typhimurium and s. heidelberg isolates.


RESULTS
we analyzed a broad set of  <dig> s. heidelberg and s. typhimurium isolates collected over a five-year period. we identified  <dig> heidelberg sequence types  and  <dig> typhimurium sts  that were represented by  <dig> and  <dig> pfge pulsotypes, respectively, and determined the discriminatory power of each method.


CONCLUSIONS
for s. heidelberg, our data shows that combined typing by both crispr-mvlst and pfge provided a discriminatory power of  <dig> . importantly, crispr-mvlst was able to separate common pfge patterns such as jf6x <dig>  into distinct sts, thus providing significantly greater discriminatory power. conversely, we show that subtyping by either crispr-mvlst or pfge independently provides a sufficient discriminatory power  for s. typhimurium. additionally, using isolates from two s. typhimurium outbreaks, we demonstrate that crispr-mvlst provides excellent epidemiologic concordance.
