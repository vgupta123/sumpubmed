BACKGROUND
isoflavones, the most abundant phytoestrogens in soy foods, are structurally similar to 17beta-estradiol. it is known that 17beta-estradiol induces apoptosis in anteroventral periventricular nucleus  in rat brain. also, there is evidence that consumption of soy isoflavones reduces the volume of avpv in male rats. therefore, in this study, we examined the influence of dietary soy isoflavones on apoptosis in avpv of  <dig> day-old male rats fed either a soy isoflavone-free diet  or a soy isoflavone-rich diet .


RESULTS
the occurrence of apoptosis in avpv was examined by tunel staining. the incidence of apoptosis was about  <dig> times higher in the phyto- <dig> group  than in the phyto-free group . furthermore, these apoptotic cells were identified as neurons by dual immunofluorescent staining of gfap and neun as markers of astrocytes and neurons, respectively. then the dopaminergic neurons in avpv were detected by immunohistochemistry staining of tyrosine hydroxylase . no significant difference in the number of th neurons was observed between the diet treatment groups. when estrogen receptor  alpha and beta were examined by immunohistochemistry, we observed a 22% reduction of erbeta-positive cell numbers in avpv with consumption of soy isoflavones, whereas no significant change in eralpha-positive cell numbers was detected. furthermore, almost all the apoptotic cells were erbeta-immunoreactive , but not eralpha-ir. last, subcutaneous injections of equol  that accounts for approximately 70â€“90% of the total circulating plasma isoflavone levels did not alter the volume of avpv in adult male rats.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, these findings provide direct evidence that consumption of soy isoflavones, but not the exposure to equol, influences the loss of erbeta-containing neurons in male avpv.
