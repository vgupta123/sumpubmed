BACKGROUND
bacillus cereus is a foodborne pathogen that causes emetic or diarrheal types of food poisoning. the incidence of b. cereus food poisoning has been gradually increasing over the past few years, therefore, biocontrol agents effective against b. cereus need to be developed. endolysins are phage-encoded bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases and have received considerable attention as promising antibacterial agents.


RESULTS
the endolysin from b. cereus phage b <dig>  designated lysb <dig>  was identified and characterized. in silico analysis revealed that this endolysin had the vany domain at the n terminus as the catalytic domain, and the sh3_ <dig> domain at the c terminus that appears to be the cell wall binding domain. biochemical characterization of lysb <dig> enzymatic activity showed that it had optimal peptidoglycan hydrolase activity at ph  <dig> - <dig>  and 50Â°c. the lytic activity was dependent on divalent metal ions, especially zn2+. the antimicrobial spectrum was relatively broad because lysb <dig> lysed gram-positive bacteria such as b. cereus, bacillus subtilis and listeria monocytogenes and some gram-negative bacteria when treated with edta. lc-ms analysis of the cell wall cleavage products showed that lysb <dig> was an l-alanoyl-d-glutamate endopeptidase, making lysb <dig> the first characterized endopeptidase of this type to target b. cereus.


CONCLUSIONS
lysb <dig> is believed to be the first reported l-alanoyl-d-glutamate endopeptidase from b. cereus-infecting bacteriophages. the properties of lysb <dig> showed that this endolysin has strong lytic activity against a broad range of pathogenic bacteria, which makes lysb <dig> a good candidate as a biocontrol agent against b. cereus and other pathogenic bacteria.
