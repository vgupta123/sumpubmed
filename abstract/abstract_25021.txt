BACKGROUND
leucine rich repeats  are present in over  <dig>  proteins that have been identified in viruses, bacteria, archae, and eukaryotes. all known structures of repeated lrrs adopt an arc shape. most lrrs are 20- <dig> residues long. all lrrs contain lxxlxlxxnxl, in which "l" is leu, ile, val, or phe and "n" is asn, thr, ser, or cys and "x" is any amino acid. seven classes of lrrs have been identified. however, other lrr classes remains to be characterized. the evolution of lrrs is not well understood.


RESULTS
here we describe a novel lrr domain, or nested repeat observed in  <dig> proteins from  <dig> bacterial species. this novel lrr domain has  <dig> residues with the consensus sequence of lxxlxlxxnxlxxldlxxxx or lxxlxcxxnxlxxldlxxxx. this lrr domain is characterized by a nested periodicity; it consists of alternating 10- and 11- residues units of lxxlxlxxnx. we call it "irreko" lrr, since the japanese word for "nested" is "irreko". the first unit of the "irreko" lrr domain is frequently occupied by an "sds22-like" lrr with the consensus of lxxlxlxxnxlxxlxxlxxlxx or a "bacterial" lrr with the consensus of lxxlxlxxnxlxxlpxlpxx. in some proteins an "sds22-like" lrr intervenes between "irreko" lrrs.


CONCLUSIONS
proteins having "irreko" lrr domain are almost exclusively found in bacteria. it is suggested that irreko@lrr evolved from a common ancestor with "sds22-like" and "bacterial" classes and that the ancestor of irreko@lrr is  <dig> or  <dig> residues of lxxlxlxxnx. the "irreko" lrr is predicted to adopt an arc shape with smaller curvature in which Î²-strands are formed on both concave and convex surfaces.
