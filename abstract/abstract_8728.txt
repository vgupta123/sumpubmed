BACKGROUND
incorporating variable amino acid stereochemistry in molecular design has the potential to improve existing protein stability and create new topologies inaccessible to homochiral molecules. the protein data bank has been a reliable, rich source of information on molecular interactions and their role in protein stability and structure. d-amino acids rarely occur naturally, making it difficult to infer general rules for how they would be tolerated in proteins through an analysis of existing protein structures. however, protein elements containing short left-handed turns and helices turn out to contain useful information. molecular mechanisms used in proteins to stabilize left-handed elements by l-amino acids are structurally enantiomeric to potential synthetic strategies for stabilizing right-handed elements with d-amino acids.


RESULTS
propensities for amino acids to occur in contiguous αl helices correlate with published thermodynamic scales for incorporation of d-amino acids into αr helices. two backbone rules for terminating a left-handed helix are found: an αr conformation is disfavored at the amino terminus, and a βr conformation is disfavored at the carboxy terminus. helix capping sidechain-backbone interactions are found which are unique to αl helices including an elevated propensity for l-asn, and l-thr at the amino terminus and l-gln, l-thr and l-ser at the carboxy terminus.


CONCLUSIONS
by examining left-handed α-turns containing l-amino acids, new interaction motifs for incorporating d-amino acids into right-handed α-helices are identified. these will provide a basis for de novo design of novel heterochiral protein folds.
