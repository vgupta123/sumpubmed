BACKGROUND
in the few years since its discovery, rnai has turned into a very powerful tool for the study of gene function by allowing post-transcriptional gene silencing. the rnai mechanism, which is based on the introduction of a double-stranded rna  trigger whose sequence is similar to that of the targeted messenger rna , is subject to off-target cross-reaction.


RESULTS
we use a novel strategy based on phenotypic analysis of paralogs and predict that, in caenorhabditis elegans, off-target effects occur when an mrna sequence shares more than 95% identity over  <dig> nucleotides with the dsrna. interestingly, our results suggest that the minimum length necessary of a high-similarity stretch between a dsrna and its target in order to observe an efficient rnai effect varies from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides rather than  <dig> nucleotides, which is the length of sirnas in c. elegans.


CONCLUSIONS
our predictive methods would improve the design of dsrna and ultimately the use of rnai as a therapeutic tool upon experimental verification.
