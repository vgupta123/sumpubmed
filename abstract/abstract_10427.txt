BACKGROUND
the hypercellulolytic mutant hypocrea jecorina  rut c <dig> is the h. jecorina strain most frequently used for cellulase fermentations and has also often been employed for basic research on cellulase regulation. this strain has been reported to contain a truncated carbon catabolite repressor gene cre <dig> and is consequently carbon catabolite derepressed. to date this and an additional frame-shift mutation in the glycoprotein-processing β-glucosidase ii encoding gene are the only known genetic differences in strain rut c <dig> 


RESULTS
in the present paper we show that h. jecorina rut c <dig> lacks an  <dig> kb genomic fragment, and consequently misses additional  <dig> genes comprising transcription factors, enzymes of the primary metabolism and transport proteins. this loss is already present in the ancestor of rut c <dig> – ng  <dig> – and seems to have occurred in a palindromic at-rich repeat  typically inducing chromosomal translocations, and is not linked to the cre <dig> locus. the mutation of the cre <dig> locus has specifically occurred in rut c <dig>  some of the genes that are lacking in rut c <dig> could be correlated with pronounced alterations in its phenotype, such as poor growth on α-linked oligo- and polyglucosides , or disturbance of osmotic homeostasis.


CONCLUSIONS
our data place a general caveat on the use of h. jecorina rut c <dig> for further basic research.
