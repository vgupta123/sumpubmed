BACKGROUND
olea europaea l. is a traditional tree crop of the mediterranean basin with a worldwide economical high impact. differently from other fruit tree species, little is known about the physiological and molecular basis of the olive fruit development and a few sequences of genes and gene products are available for olive in public databases. this study deals with the identification of large sets of differentially expressed genes in developing olive fruits and the subsequent computational annotation by means of different software.


RESULTS
mrna from fruits of the cv. leccino sampled at three different stages  was used for the identification of differentially expressed genes putatively involved in main processes along fruit development. four subtractive hybridization libraries were constructed: forward and reverse between stage  <dig> and  <dig> , and  <dig> and  <dig> . all sequenced clones  were analyzed through blastx against non-redundant ncbi databases and about 60% of them showed similarity to known proteins. a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> differentially expressed unique sequences was further investigated by real-time pcr, showing a validation of the ssh results as high as 69%. library-specific cdna repertories were annotated according to the three main vocabularies of the gene ontology : cellular component, biological process and molecular function. blastx analysis, go terms mapping and annotation analysis were performed using the blast2go software, a research tool designed with the main purpose of enabling go based data mining on sequence sets for which no go annotation is yet available. bioinformatic analysis pointed out a significantly different distribution of the annotated sequences for each go category, when comparing the three fruit developmental stages. the olive fruit-specific transcriptome dataset was used to query all known kegg  metabolic pathways for characterizing and positioning retrieved est records. the integration of the olive sequence datasets within the mapman platform for microarray analysis allowed the identification of specific biosynthetic pathways useful for the definition of key functional categories in time course analyses for gene groups.


CONCLUSIONS
the bioinformatic annotation of all gene sequences was useful to shed light on metabolic pathways and transcriptional aspects related to carbohydrates, fatty acids, secondary metabolites, transcription factors and hormones as well as response to biotic and abiotic stresses throughout olive drupe development. these results represent a first step toward both functional genomics and systems biology research for understanding the gene functions and regulatory networks in olive fruit growth and ripening.
