BACKGROUND
the objective of the present study was to elucidate the humoral and cellular immune response mechanisms by which a reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine reduces the pcv <dig> viremia. forty pcv <dig> seronegative 3-week-old pigs were randomly divided into the following four groups: vaccinated challenged , vaccinated non-challenged , non-vaccinated challenged , and non-vaccinated non-challenged  animals. the pigs in groups t <dig> and t <dig> were immunized with a reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine  administered as a  <dig>  ml dose at  <dig> days of age. at  <dig> days of age , the pigs in groups t <dig> and t <dig> were inoculated intranasally with  <dig> ml each of pcv2b.


RESULTS
a reduction of pcv <dig> viremia coincided with the appearance of both pcv2-specific neutralizing antibodies  and interferon-γ-secreting cells  in the vaccinated animals. however, the presence of anti-pcv <dig> igg antibodies did not correlate with the reduction of pcv <dig> viremia. lymphocyte subset analysis indicated that the numbers of cd3+ and cd4+ cells increased in vaccinated animals but the numbers of cd4+ cells decreased transiently in non-vaccinated animals. the observation of a delayed type hypersensitivity response in only the vaccinated animals also supports a cd4+ cell-associated protective cellular immune response induced by the reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine.


CONCLUSIONS
the induction of pcv2-specific na and ifn-γ-scs, and cd4+ cells by the reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine is the important protective immune response leading to reduction of the pcv <dig> viremia and control of the pcv <dig> infection. to our knowledge this is the first demonstration of protective humoral and cellular immunity induced by the reformulated inactivated chimeric pcv1- <dig> vaccine and its effect on reduction of pcv <dig> viremia by vaccination.
