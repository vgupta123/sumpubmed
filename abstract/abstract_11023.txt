BACKGROUND
epithelial to mesenchymal transition  induced by transforming growth factor-β  is an important cellular event in organogenesis, cancer, and organ fibrosis. the process to reverse emt is not well established. our purpose is to define signaling pathways and transcription factors that maintain the tgf-β-induced mesenchymal state.


RESULTS
inhibitors of five kinases implicated in emt, tgf-β type i receptor kinase , p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase , map kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase activator kinase , c-jun nh-terminal kinase , and rho kinase , were evaluated for reversal of the mesenchymal state induced in renal tubular epithelial cells. single agents did not fully reverse emt as determined by cellular morphology and gene expression. however, exposure to the tβri inhibitor sb <dig>  combined with the rock inhibitor y <dig>  eliminated detectable actin stress fibers and mesenchymal gene expression while restoring epithelial e-cadherin and kidney-specific cadherin  expression. a second combination, the tβri inhibitor sb <dig> together with the p <dig> mapk inhibitor sb <dig>  was partially effective in reversing emt. furthermore, jnk inhibitor sp <dig> inhibits the effectiveness of the tβri inhibitor sb <dig> to reverse emt. to explore the molecular basis underlying emt reversal, we also targeted the transcriptional repressors zeb <dig> and zeb2/sip <dig>  decreasing zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> expression in mouse mammary gland cells with shrnas was sufficient to up-regulate expression of epithelial proteins such as e-cadherin and to re-establish epithelial features. however, complete restoration of cortical f-actin required incubation with the rock inhibitor y <dig> in combination with zeb1/ <dig> knockdown.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that reversal of emt requires re-establishing both epithelial transcription and structural components by sustained and independent signaling through tβri and rock. these findings indicate that combination small molecule therapy targeting multiple kinases may be necessary to reverse disease conditions.
