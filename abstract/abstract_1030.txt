BACKGROUND
the monitoring of infectious diseases like the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  using pen-wise oral fluid samples becomes more and more established. the collection of individual oral fluid, which would be useful in the monitoring of prrsv negative boar studs, is rather difficult. the aim of the study was to test two methods for individual oral fluid collection from pigs and to evaluate the specificity of a commercial elisa for detection of prrsv antibodies in these sample matrices. for this reason,  <dig> serum samples from prrsv negative pigs  and  <dig> serum samples from prrsv positive pigs  were tested for prrsv antibodies with a commercial elisa. individual oral fluid was collected with a cotton gauze swab from  <dig> pigs from group  <dig> and  <dig> pigs from group  <dig>  furthermore,  <dig> oral fluid samples from group  <dig> and  <dig> oral fluid samples from group  <dig> were taken with a self-drying foam swab . the recollected oral fluid was then analysed twice with a commercial elisa for detection of prrsv antibodies in oral fluid.


RESULTS
all serum samples from group  <dig> tested negative for prrsv antibodies. the collection of oral fluid was sufficient in all samples. sampling with genotubes was less time consuming than sampling with cotton gauze swabs. false positive results were obtained in  <dig>  respectively  <dig>  oral fluid samples recollected from cotton gauze swabs and in  <dig> and  <dig> samples from genotubes. the specificity of the oral fluid elisa was  <dig> % for cotton gauze swabs and  <dig> % for genotubes.  <dig> out of  <dig> serum samples and all oral fluid samples from group  <dig> tested positive for prrsv antibodies. the sensitivity of the oral fluid elisa was 100%. according to the kappa coefficient, the results showed an almost perfect agreement between serum and oral fluid collected in both ways .


CONCLUSIONS
both methods used for individual oral fluid collection proved to be practical and efficient and can be used for prrsv antibody detection. it has to be considered, however, that false positive results may occur more often than in serum samples.
