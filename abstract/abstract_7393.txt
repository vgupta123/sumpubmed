BACKGROUND
microarray technology allows the analysis of genomic aberrations at an ever increasing resolution, making functional interpretation of these vast amounts of data the main bottleneck in routine implementation of high resolution array platforms, and emphasising the need for a centralised and easy to use cnv data management and interpretation system.


RESULTS
we present cnv-webstore, an online platform to streamline the processing and downstream interpretation of microarray data in a clinical context, tailored towards but not limited to the illumina beadarray platform. provided analysis tools include cnv analsyis, parent of origin and uniparental disomy detection. interpretation tools include data visualisation, gene prioritisation, automated pubmed searching, linking data to several genome browsers and annotation of cnvs based on several public databases. finally a module is provided for uniform reporting of results.


CONCLUSIONS
cnv-webstore is able to present copy number data in an intuitive way to both lab technicians and clinicians, making it a useful tool in daily clinical practice.
