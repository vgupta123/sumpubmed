BACKGROUND
in response to pathogen attack, grapevine synthesizes phytoalexins belonging to the family of stilbenes. grapevine cell cultures represent a good model system for studying the basic mechanisms of plant response to biotic and abiotic elicitors. among these, modified β-cyclodextrins seem to act as true elicitors inducing strong production of the stilbene resveratrol.


RESULTS
the transcriptome changes of vitis riparia × vitis berlandieri grapevine cells in response to the modified β-cyclodextrin, dimeb, were analyzed  <dig> and  <dig> h after treatment using a suppression subtractive hybridization experiment and a microarray analysis respectively. at both time points, we identified a specific set of induced genes belonging to the general phenylpropanoid metabolism, including stilbenes and hydroxycinnamates, and to defence proteins such as pr proteins and chitinases. at  <dig> h we also observed a down-regulation of the genes involved in cell division and cell-wall loosening.


CONCLUSIONS
we report the first large-scale study of the molecular effects of dimeb, a resveratrol inducer, on grapevine cell cultures. this molecule seems to mimic a defence elicitor which enhances the physical barriers of the cell, stops cell division and induces phytoalexin synthesis.
