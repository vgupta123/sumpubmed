BACKGROUND
probiotics such as bifidobacteria have been shown to maintain a healthy intestinal microbial balance and help protect against infections. however, despite these benefits, bifidobacteria still remain poorly understood at the biochemical, physiological and especially the genetic level. herein we describe, for the first time, the development of a non-invasive luciferase-based reporter system for real-time tracking of bifidobacterium species in vivo.


RESULTS
the reporter vector pluxmc <dig> is based on the recently described theta-type plasmid pbc <dig> from b. catenatulatum  <cit>  and the luxabcde operon from ppl2lux  <cit> . derivatives of pluxmc <dig>  harbouring a bifidobacterial promoter  as well as a synthetically derived promoter   <cit>  placed upstream of luxabcde, were constructed and found to stably replicate in b. breve ucc <dig>  the subsequent analysis of these strains allowed us to assess the functionality of pluxmc <dig> both in vitro and in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate the potential of pluxmc <dig> as a real-time, non-invasive reporter system for bifidobacterium. it has also allowed us, for the first time, to track the colonisation potential and persistence of this probiotic species in real time. an interesting and significant outcome of the study is the identification of the caecum as a niche environment for b. breve ucc <dig> within the mouse gastrointestinal tract  tract.
