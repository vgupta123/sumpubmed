BACKGROUND
cadherins are cell surface adhesion molecules that play important roles in development of vertebrate tissues and organs. we studied cadherin <dig> expression in developing zebrafish heart using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical methods, and we found that cadherin <dig> was strongly expressed by the myocardium of the embryonic zebrafish. to gain insight into cadherin <dig> role in the formation and function of the heart, we analyzed cardiac differentiation and performance in a cadherin <dig> mutant, glass onion .


RESULTS
we found that the cadherin <dig> mutant had enlarged pericardial cavity, disorganized atrium and ventricle, and reduced expression of a ventricular specific marker vmhc. individual myocardiocytes in the glo mutant embryos became round shaped and loosely aggregated. in vivo measurements of cardiac performance revealed that the mutant heart had significantly reduced heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output compared to control embryos. formation of the embryonic vascular system in the glo mutants was also affected.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that cadherin <dig> plays an essential role in zebrafish cardiovascular development. although the exact mechanisms remain unknown as to the formation of the enlarged pericardium and reduced peripheral blood flow, it is clear that  myocardiocyte differentiation and physiological cardiovascular  performance is impaired when cadherin <dig> function is disrupted.
