BACKGROUND
obesity has deleterious effects on the brain, and metabolic dysfunction may exacerbate the outcomes of seizures and brain injuries. however, it is unclear whether obesity affects excitotoxicity-induced neuronal cell death. the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a high-fat diet  on neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the hippocampus of kainic acid -treated mice.


RESULTS
mice were fed with a hfd or normal diet for 8 weeks and then received a systemic injection of ka. hfd-fed mice showed hypercholesterolemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. hfd-fed mice showed greater susceptibility to ka-induced seizures, an increased number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dutp nick end labeling -positive cells, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. furthermore, we found that ka treatment increased hfd-induced calpain <dig>  nuclear factor e2-related factor  <dig>  and heme oxygenase- <dig> expression in the hippocampus.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings imply that complex mechanisms affected by obesity-induced systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, er stress, calcium overload, and oxidative stress may contribute to neuronal death after brain injury.
