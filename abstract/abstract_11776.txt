BACKGROUND
we previously reported that the pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into cardiomyocytes  by co-culture with neonatal cms  in vitro. however, the involving mechanism is not clear.

methods
mouse induced pluripotent stem cells  were cultured in hanging drops to form embryoid bodies  and to induce myocardial differentiation. co-culture of ebs and ncms was established in a transwell insert system, while ebs grown alone in the wells were used as controls.


RESULTS
co-culture with ncms markedly increased the generation of functional cms from ipscs. the focal adhesion kinase  phosphorylation, and c-jun n-terminal kinase  phosphorylation in co-culture were higher than that in ebs grown alone. treating fak small interfering rna  or specific inhibitor for jnk  to ipscs significantly reduced the phosphorylation of jnk and the expressions of mef2c and bcl- <dig>  the expressions of ctnt and mlc-2v were also decreased. our results revealed that co-culture with ncms significantly enhance the differentiation ability of ipscs by increasing mef2c and bcl- <dig> expressions concomitantly with a marked augment on cell proliferation through jnk signaling pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings indicated that co-culture of ebs with ncms induces genes expressed in a mature pattern and stimulates the proliferation of ipsc-derived cms  by activating fak/jnk signaling.
