BACKGROUND
aberrant activation of the hedgehog  signaling pathway in different organisms has shown the importance of this family of morphogens during development. genetic screens in zebrafish have assigned specific roles for hh in proliferation, differentiation and patterning, but mainly as a result of a loss of its activity. we attempted to fully activate the hh pathway by removing both receptors for the hh proteins, called patched <dig> and  <dig>  which are functioning as negative regulators in this pathway.


RESULTS
here we describe a splice-donor mutation in ptc <dig>  called ptc1hu <dig>  which in a homozygous state results in a subtle eye and somite phenotype. since we recently positionally cloned a ptc <dig> mutant, a ptc1;ptc <dig> double mutant was generated, showing severely increased levels of ptc <dig>  gli <dig> and nkx <dig> a, confirming an aberrant activation of hh signaling. as a consequence, a number of phenotypes were observed that have not been reported previously using shh mrna overexpression. somites of ptc1;ptc <dig> double mutants do not express anteroposterior polarity markers, however initial segmentation of the somites itself is not affected. this is the first evidence that segmentation and anterior/posterior  patterning of the somites are genetically uncoupled processes. furthermore, a novel negative function of hh signaling is observed in the induction of the fin field, acting well before any of the previously reported function of shh in fin formation and in a way that is different from the proposed early role of gli <dig> in limb/fin bud patterning.


CONCLUSIONS
the generation and characterization of the ptc1;ptc <dig> double mutant assigned novel and unexpected functions to the hh signaling pathway. additionally, these mutants will provide a useful system to further investigate the consequences of constitutively activated hh signaling during vertebrate development.
