BACKGROUND
trichomonosis caused by trichomonas vaginalis is the number one, non-viral sexually transmitted disease  that affects more than  <dig> million people worldwide. immunoglobulin a  has been implicated in resistance to mucosal infections by pathogens. no reports are available of iga-reactive proteins and the role, if any, of this class of antibody in the control of this std. the availability of an iga monoclonal antibody  immunoreactive to trichomonads by whole cell -elisa prompted us to characterize the iga-reactive protein of t. vaginalis.


RESULTS
an iga mab called 6b <dig> was isolated from a library of mabs reactive to surface proteins of t. vaginalis. the 6b <dig> mab recognized a 44-kda protein  by immunoblot analysis, and a full-length cdna clone encoded a protein of  <dig> amino acids. southern analysis revealed the gene  of t. vaginalis to be single copy. the tv <dig> gene was down-regulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels in iron-depleted trichomonads as well as in parasites after contact with immortalized ms- <dig> vaginal epithelial cells . immunofluorescence on non-permeabilized organisms confirmed surface localization of tv <dig>  and the intensity of fluorescence was reduced after parasite adherence to vecs. lastly, an identical protein and gene were present in tritrichomonas foetus and trichomonas tenax.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of a t. vaginalis gene  encoding a surface protein  reactive with an iga mab, and both gene and protein were conserved in human and bovine trichomonads. further, tv <dig> is independently down-regulated in expression and surface placement by iron and contact with vecs. tv <dig> is another member of t. vaginalis genes that are regulated by at least two independent signaling mechanisms involving iron and contact with vecs.
