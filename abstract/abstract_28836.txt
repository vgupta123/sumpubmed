BACKGROUND
the ability to regulate metabolism is a fundamental process in living systems. we present an analysis of one of the mechanisms by which metabolic regulation occurs: enzyme inhibition and activation by small molecules. we look at the network properties of this regulatory system and the relationship between the chemical properties of regulatory molecules.


RESULTS
we find that many features of the regulatory network, such as the degree and clustering coefficient, closely match those of the underlying metabolic network. while these global features are conserved across several organisms, we do find local differences between regulation in e. coli and h. sapiens which reflect their different lifestyles. chemical structure appears to play an important role in determining a compounds suitability for use in regulation. chemical structure also often determines how groups of similar compounds can regulate sets of enzymes. these groups of compounds and the enzymes they regulate form modules that mirror the modules and pathways of the underlying metabolic network. we also show how knowledge of chemical structure and regulation could be used to predict regulatory interactions for drugs.


CONCLUSIONS
the metabolic regulatory network shares many of the global properties of the metabolic network, but often varies at the level of individual compounds. chemical structure is a key determinant in deciding how a compound is used in regulation and for defining modules within the regulatory system.
