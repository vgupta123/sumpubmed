BACKGROUND
cell elongation in plants requires addition and re-arrangements of cell wall components. even if some protein families have been shown to play roles in these events, a global picture of proteins present in cell walls of elongating cells is still missing. a proteomic study was performed on etiolated hypocotyls of arabidopsis used as model of cells undergoing elongation followed by growth arrest within a short time.


RESULTS
two developmental stages  were compared. a new strategy consisting of high performance cation exchange chromatography and mono-dimensional electrophoresis was established for separation of cell wall proteins. this work allowed identification of  <dig> predicted secreted proteins, among which  <dig> had not been identified previously. apart from expected proteins known to be involved in cell wall extension such as xyloglucan endotransglucosylase-hydrolases, expansins, polygalacturonases, pectin methylesterases and peroxidases, new proteins were identified such as proteases, proteins related to lipid metabolism and proteins of unknown function.


CONCLUSIONS
this work highlights the cwp dynamics that takes place between the two developmental stages. the presence of proteins known to be related to cell wall extension after growth arrest showed that these proteins may play other roles in cell walls. finally, putative regulatory mechanisms of protein biological activity are discussed from this global view of cell wall proteins.
