BACKGROUND
acidity exerts a determining influence on the composition and diversity of freshwater faunas. while the physiological implications of freshwater acidification have been intensively studied in teleost fish and crayfish, much less is known about the acid-stress physiology of ecologically important groups such as cladoceran zooplankton. this study analyzed the extracellular acid-base state and co <dig> partial pressure , circulation and ventilation, as well as the respiration rate of daphnia pulex acclimated to acidic  and circumneutral  conditions.


RESULTS
d. pulex had a remarkably high extracellular ph of  <dig>  and extracellular pco <dig> of  <dig>  kpa under normal ambient conditions . the hemolymph had a high bicarbonate concentration of  <dig>  mm and a total buffer value of  <dig>  meq l- <dig> ph- <dig>  bicarbonate covered 93% of the total buffer value. acidic conditions induced a slight acidosis , a 30â€“65% bicarbonate loss, and elevated systemic activities . ph  <dig>  animals partly compensated the bicarbonate loss by increasing the non-bicarbonate buffer value from  <dig>  to  <dig>  meq l- <dig> ph- <dig>  the extracellular pco <dig> of ph  <dig>  animals was significantly reduced to  <dig>  kpa, and these animals showed the highest tolerance to a short-term exposure to severe acid stress.


CONCLUSIONS
chronic exposure to acidic conditions had a pervasive impact on daphnia's physiology including acid-base balance, extracellular pco <dig>  circulation and ventilation, and energy metabolism. compensatory changes in extracellular non-bicarbonate buffering capacity and the improved tolerance to severe acid stress indicated the activation of defense mechanisms which may result from gene-expression mediated adjustments in hemolymph buffer proteins and in epithelial properties. mechanistic analyses of the interdependence between extracellular acid-base balance and co <dig> transport raised the question of whether a carbonic anhydrase  is involved in the catalysis of the  reaction, which led to the discovery of  <dig> ca-genes in the genome of d. pulex.
