BACKGROUND
west nile virus  infection can cause severe meningitis and encephalitis in humans. apoptosis was recently shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of wnv encephalitis. here, we used wnv-infected glioma cells to study wnv-replication and wnv-induced apoptosis in human brain-derived cells.


RESULTS
t98g cells are highly permissive for lytic wnv-infection as demonstrated by the production of infectious virus titre and the development of a characteristic cytopathic effect. wnv replication decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis as indicated by the activation of the effector caspase- <dig>  the initiator caspases- <dig> and - <dig>  polypolymerase  cleavage and the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. truncation of bid indicated cross-talk between the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. inhibition of the caspases- <dig> or - <dig> inhibited parp cleavage, demonstrating that both caspases are involved in wnv-induced apoptosis. pan-caspase inhibition prevented wnv-induced apoptosis without affecting virus replication.


CONCLUSIONS
we found that wnv infection induces cell death in the brain-derived tumour cell line t98g by apoptosis under involvement of constituents of the extrinsic as well as the intrinsic apoptotic pathways. our results illuminate the molecular mechanism of wnv-induced neural cell death.
