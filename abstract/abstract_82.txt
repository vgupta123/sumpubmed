BACKGROUND
it has been proposed that adenosine triphosphate  released from red blood cells  may contribute to the tight coupling between blood flow and oxygen demand in contracting skeletal muscle. to determine whether atp may contribute to the vasodilatory response to exercise in the forearm, we measured arterialised and venous plasma atp concentration and venous oxygen content in  <dig> healthy young males at rest, and at  <dig> and  <dig> seconds during dynamic handgrip exercise at 45% of maximum voluntary contraction .


RESULTS
venous plasma atp concentration was elevated above rest after  <dig> seconds of exercise , and remained at this higher level  <dig> seconds into exercise . the increase in atp was mirrored by a decrease in venous oxygen content. while there was no significant relationship between atp concentration and venous oxygen content at  <dig> seconds of exercise, they were moderately and inversely correlated at  <dig> seconds of exercise . arterial atp concentration remained unchanged throughout exercise, resulting in an increase in the venous-arterial atp difference.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively these results indicate that atp in the plasma originated from the muscle microcirculation, and are consistent with the notion that deoxygenation of the blood perfusing the muscle acts as a stimulus for atp release. that atp concentration was elevated just  <dig> seconds after the onset of exercise also suggests that atp may be a contributing factor to the blood flow response in the transition from rest to steady state exercise.
