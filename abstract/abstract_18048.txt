BACKGROUND
despite the heat-related physiology and heat-shock proteins in maize have been extensively studied, little is known about the transcriptome profiling of how the maize varieties with different genotypes responding to high temperatures. seedling mortality of xiantian  <dig>  is significantly lower than that of zhefengtian  when exposed to high temperature  and followed by a recovery growth . therefore, we performed a transcriptome analysis using the total rna extracted from the leaves of xt and zf that were previously subjected to heat stress at 42 °c for 0 h,  <dig>  h, and 3 h, respectively.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> commonly up-regulated and  <dig>  commonly down-regulated genes were identified among xt/zf, xt <dig> /zf <dig>  and xt3/zf <dig> using transcriptome analysis. gene ontology classification of the  <dig> up-regulated genes showed that their encoded proteins were significantly assigned to  <dig> cellular components, and were classified into  <dig> functional categories, and were involved in  <dig> biological processes. most of proteins encoded by up-regulated genes were localized in chloroplast and its structural components, and involved in multiple biological processes associated with photosynthesis, indicating that these chloroplast proteins play an important role in increasing heat tolerance in sweet maize. while the proteins encoded by  <dig>  down-regulated genes were significantly assigned to  <dig> cellular components, and were classified into  <dig> functional categories, and were involved in  <dig> biological processes. interestingly, these proteins were involved in a series of biological processes from gene expression to translation, suggesting that lowering these processes may contribute to improved heat resistance in sweet maize. the up-regulated genes were identified to be involved in  <dig> distinct metabolic pathways, of which the most significant ones was secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathway. while the down-regulated genes were identified to be involved in  <dig> distinct metabolic pathways, of which the most significant ones were found in ribosome. quantitative real-time pcr analysis demonstrated that  <dig> genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and photosynthesis in xt have higher abundance than those in zf, whereas  <dig> ribosome genes in xt showed lower abundance than those in zf. in addition, heat-tolerant sweet maize may keep at lower growth level than heat-sensitive one through dowregulating expression of genes related to zeatin and brassinosteroid biosynthesis to better regulate heat stress responses.


CONCLUSIONS
comparative transcriptomic profiling reveals transcriptional alterations in heat-resistant and heat-sensitive sweet maize varieties under heat stress, which provides a new insight into underlying molecular mechanism of maize in response to heat stress.
