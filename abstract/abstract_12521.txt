BACKGROUND
trypanosoma cruzi is a kinetoplastid parasite of humans and is the cause of chagas disease, a potentially lethal condition affecting the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems of the human host. constraint-based modeling has emerged in the last decade as a useful approach to integrating genomic and other high-throughput data sets with more traditional, experimental data acquired through decades of research and published in the literature.


RESULTS
we present a validated, constraint-based model of the core metabolism of trypanosoma cruzi strain cl brener. the model includes four compartments ,  <dig> transport reactions, and  <dig> metabolic reactions covering carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolism. in addition, we make use of several replicate high-throughput proteomic data sets to specifically examine metabolism of the morphological form of t. cruzi in the insect gut .


CONCLUSIONS
this work demonstrates the utility of constraint-based models for integrating various sources of data  to generate testable hypotheses. this model represents an approach for the systematic study of t. cruzi metabolism under a wide range of conditions and perturbations, and should eventually aid in the identification of urgently needed novel chemotherapeutic targets.
