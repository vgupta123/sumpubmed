BACKGROUND
paired-tag sequencing approaches are commonly used for the analysis of genome structure. however, mammalian genomes have a complex organization with a variety of repetitive elements that complicate comprehensive genome-wide analyses.


RESULTS
here, we systematically assessed the utility of paired-end and mate-pair  next-generation sequencing libraries with insert sizes ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig> kb, for genome coverage and for improving scaffolding of a mammalian genome . despite a lower library complexity, large insert mp libraries  provided very high physical genome coverage and were found to efficiently span repeat elements in the genome. medium-sized  mp libraries were much more efficient for genome structure analysis than the more commonly used shorter insert paired-end and  <dig> kb mp libraries. furthermore, the combination of medium- and large insert libraries resulted in a 3-fold increase in n <dig> in scaffolding processes. finally, we show that our data can be used to evaluate and improve contig order and orientation in the current rat reference genome assembly.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that applying combinations of mate-pair libraries with insert sizes that match the distributions of repetitive elements improves contig scaffolding and can contribute to the finishing of draft genomes.
