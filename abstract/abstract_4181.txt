BACKGROUND
human aortic preferentially expressed protein- <dig>  is a novel specific smooth muscle differentiation marker thought to play a role in the growth and differentiation of arterial smooth muscle cells .


RESULTS
good quality crystals that were suitable for x-ray crystallographic studies were obtained following the truncation of the  <dig> n-terminal amino acids of apeg- <dig>  a region predicted to be disordered. the truncated protein  consists of a single immunoglobulin  like domain which includes an arg-gly-asp  adhesion recognition motif. the rgd motif is crucial for the interaction of extracellular proteins and plays a role in cell adhesion. the x-ray structure of Δapeg- <dig> was determined and was refined to sub-atomic resolution . this is the best resolution for an immunoglobulin domain structure so far. the structure adopts a greek-key β-sandwich fold and belongs to the i  set of the immunoglobulin superfamily. the residues lying between the β-sheets form a hydrophobic core. the rgd motif folds into a  <dig> helix that is involved in the formation of a homodimer in the crystal which is mainly stabilized by salt bridges. analytical ultracentrifugation studies revealed a moderate dissociation constant of  <dig> μm at physiological ionic strength, suggesting that apeg- <dig> dimerisation is only transient in the cell. the binding constant is strongly dependent on ionic strength.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggests that the rgd motif might play a role not only in the adhesion of extracellular proteins but also in intracellular protein-protein interactions. however, it remains to be established whether the rather weak dimerisation of apeg- <dig> involving this motif is physiogically relevant.
