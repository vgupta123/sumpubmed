BACKGROUND
histone lysine methylation plays a fundamental role in chromatin organization and marks distinct chromatin regions. in particular, trimethylation at lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig>  and at lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig>  governed by the histone methyltransferases suv39h1/ <dig> and suv420h1/ <dig> respectively, have emerged as a hallmark of pericentric heterochromatin. controlled chromatin organization is crucial for gene expression regulation and genome stability. therefore, it is essential to analyze mechanisms responsible for high order chromatin packing and in particular the interplay between enzymes involved in histone modifications, such as histone methyltransferases and proteins that recognize these epigenetic marks.


RESULTS
to gain insights into the mechanisms of suv420h <dig> recruitment at heterochromatin, we applied a tandem affinity purification approach coupled to mass spectrometry. we identified heterochromatin proteins hp <dig> as main interacting partners. the regions responsible for the binding were mapped to the heterochromatic targeting module of suv420h <dig> and hp <dig> chromoshadow domain. we studied the dynamic properties of suv420h <dig> and the hp <dig> in living cells using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. our results showed that hp <dig> proteins are highly mobile with different dynamics during the cell cycle, whereas suv420h <dig> remains strongly bound to pericentric heterochromatin. an  <dig> amino-acids region of suv420h <dig>  the heterochromatic targeting module, recapitulates both, hp <dig> binding and strong association to heterochromatin.


CONCLUSIONS
frap experiments reveal that in contrast to hp <dig>  suv420h <dig> is strongly associated to pericentric heterochromatin. then, the fraction of suv420h <dig> captured and characterized by tap/ms is a soluble fraction which may be in a stable association with hp <dig>  consequently, suv420h <dig> may be recruited to heterochromatin in association with hp <dig>  and stably maintained at its heterochromatin sites in an hp1-independent fashion.
