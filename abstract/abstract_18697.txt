BACKGROUND
dogs can suffer from inappetence caused by a variety of medical conditions. this may present as anorexia , hyporexia  or dysrexia . a drug with a new mechanism of action, capromorelin, has potential to stimulate appetite in dogs. capromorelin is a ghrelin receptor agonist, which mimics the action of endogenous ghrelin. it is a member of the growth hormone secretagogue  class of drugs. capromorelin oral solution  was tested in healthy adult male and female beagle dogs  for its effect on food consumption and body weight. a randomized, masked, placebo controlled study was conducted to measure the effects of a daily 3 mg/kg oral dose given over 4 days. dogs were observed for clinical signs, physical examinations were completed prior to and at the end of treatment, and blood was drawn before and after treatment for evaluation of serum chemistry and hematology parameters.


RESULTS
capromorelin was well-tolerated, with no abnormalities seen on physical examination or clinical pathology. some dogs showed increased salivation. capromorelin treated dogs had increased mean  food consumption compared to placebo treated dogs . treated dogs also had increased mean body weights compared to placebo treated dogs .


CONCLUSIONS
this study supports the effectiveness of capromorelin oral solution as an appetite stimulant in dogs. treatment with the oral solution resulted in dramatic increases in appetite, as measured by food consumption, of over 60% compared to placebo. the drug was well tolerated. capromorelin is the first ghrelin receptor agonist developed for appetite stimulation in any species, and represents a novel mechanism of action for this clinical use.
