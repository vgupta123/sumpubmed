BACKGROUND
protein subcellular localization is a central problem in understanding cell biology and has been the focus of intense research. in order to predict localization from amino acid sequence a myriad of features have been tried: including amino acid composition, sequence similarity, the presence of certain motifs or domains, and many others. surprisingly, sequence conservation of sorting motifs has not yet been employed, despite its extensive use for tasks such as the prediction of transcription factor binding sites.


RESULTS
here, we flip the problem around, and present a proof of concept for the idea that the lack of sequence conservation can be a novel feature for localization prediction. we show that for yeast, mammal and plant datasets, evolutionary sequence divergence alone has significant power to identify sequences with n-terminal sorting sequences. moreover sequence divergence is nearly as effective when computed on automatically defined ortholog sets as on hand curated ones. unfortunately, sequence divergence did not necessarily increase classification performance when combined with some traditional sequence features such as amino acid composition. however a post-hoc analysis of the proteins in which sequence divergence changes the prediction yielded some proteins with atypical  matrix targeting signals as well as a few misannotations.


CONCLUSIONS
we report the results of the first quantitative study of the effectiveness of evolutionary sequence divergence as a feature for protein subcellular localization prediction. we show that divergence is indeed useful for prediction, but it is not trivial to improve overall accuracy simply by adding this feature to classical sequence features. nevertheless we argue that sequence divergence is a promising feature and show anecdotal examples in which it succeeds where other features fail.
