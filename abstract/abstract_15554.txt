BACKGROUND
microorganisms constitute a reservoir of enzymes involved in environmental carbon cycling and degradation of plant polysaccharides through their production of a vast variety of glycoside hydrolases . the cazychip was developed to allow a rapid characterization at transcriptomic level of these ghs and to identify enzymes acting on hydrolysis of polysaccharides or glycans.


RESULTS
this dna biochip contains the signature of  <dig>  bacterial ghs available in the cazy database. probes were designed using two softwares, and microarrays were directly synthesized using the in situ ink-jet technology. cazychip specificity and reproducibility was validated by hybridization of known ghs rna extracted from recombinant e. coli strains, which were previously identified by a functional metagenomic approach. the ghs arsenal was also studied in bioprocess conditions using rumen derived microbiota.


CONCLUSIONS
the cazychip appears to be a user friendly tool for profiling the expression of a large variety of ghs. it can be used to study temporal variations of functional diversity, thereby facilitating the identification of new efficient candidates for enzymatic conversions from various ecosystems.
