BACKGROUND
homeostatic b cell-attracting chemokine  <dig>  otherwise known as cxcl <dig> is constitutively expressed in secondary lymphoid organs by follicular dendritic cells  and macrophages. it is the only known ligand for the cxcr <dig> receptor, which is expressed on mature b cells, follicular helper t cells , th <dig> cells and regulatory t  cells. aberrant expression of cxcl <dig> within ectopic germinal centers has been linked to the development of autoimmune disorders . we, therefore, hypothesized that antibody-mediated disruption of the cxcl <dig> signaling pathway would interfere with the formation of ectopic lymphoid follicles in the target organs and inhibit autoimmune disease progression. this work describes pre-clinical development of human anti-cxcl <dig> antibody mab  <dig> and includes therapeutic efficacy data of its mouse counterpart in murine models of autoimmunity.


RESULTS
we developed a human igg <dig> monoclonal antibody, mab  <dig> that specifically binds to human, rodent and primate cxcl <dig> with an affinity of approximately  <dig> nm and is capable of neutralizing the activity of cxcl <dig> from these various species in in vitro functional assays. for in vivo studies we have engineered a chimeric antibody to contain the same human heavy and light chain variable genes along with mouse constant regions. treatment with this antibody led to a reduction in the number of germinal centers in mice immunized with 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl hapten conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin  and, in adoptive transfer studies, interfered with the trafficking of b cells to the b cell areas of mouse spleen. furthermore, this mouse anti-cxcl <dig> antibody demonstrated efficacy in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis ) and th17-mediated murine model of multiple sclerosis ).


CONCLUSIONS
we developed a novel therapeutic antibody targeting cxcl13-mediated signaling pathway for the treatment of autoimmune disorders.
