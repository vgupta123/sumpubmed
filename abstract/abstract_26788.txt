BACKGROUND
using senescence-accelerated mouse prone  <dig> , we examined whether reduced mastication from a young age affects hippocampal-dependent cognitive function. we anesthetized male samp <dig> mice at  <dig> weeks of age and extracted all maxillary molar teeth of half the animals. the other animals were treated similarly, except that molar teeth were not extracted. at  <dig> and  <dig> weeks of age, their general behavior and their ability to recognize novel objects were tested using the open-field test  and the object-recognition test , respectively.


RESULTS
the body weight of molarless mice was reduced significantly compared to that of molar-intact mice after the extraction and did not recover to the weight of age-matched molar-intact mice throughout the experimental period. at  <dig> weeks of age, molarless mice showed significantly greater locomotor activity in the oft than molar-intact mice. however, the ability of molarless mice to discriminate a novel object in the ort was impaired compared to that of molar-intact mice. the ability of both molarless and molar-intact samp <dig> mice to recognize objects was impaired at  <dig> weeks of age. these results suggest that molarless samp <dig> mice develop a deficit of cognitive function earlier than molar-intact samp <dig> mice. interestingly, both at  <dig> and  <dig> weeks of age, molarless mice showed a lateralized preference of object location in the encoding session of the ort, in which two identical objects were presented. their lateralized preference of object location was positively correlated with the rightward turning-direction preference, which reached statistical significance at  <dig> weeks of age.


CONCLUSIONS
loss of masticatory function in early life causes malnutrition and chronic stress and impairs the ability to recognize novel objects. hyperactivation and lateralized rotational behavior are commonly observed with dysfunction of the dopaminergic system, therefore, reduced masticatory function may deplete the mesolimbic and mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic systems to impair the cognitive functions of selective attention and recognition memory in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus.
