BACKGROUND
we studied whether regulation of cdca <dig>  expression by transcription factor pax <dig> contributes to pax6’s cellular actions during corticogenesis. the function of cdca <dig> in mediating pax6’s effects during corticogenesis has not been explored. pax <dig> is expressed by radial glial progenitors in the ventricular zone of the embryonic cortical neuroepithelium, where it is required for the development of a normal complement of tbr2-expressing intermediate progenitor cells in the subventricular zone. pax6’s expression levels are graded across the ventricular zone, with highest levels laterally where tbr2-expressing progenitors are generated in greatest numbers at early stages of corticogenesis.

methods
we used in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to analyse patterns of cdca <dig> and pax <dig> expression in cortical tissue from wild-type and pax6
−/− embryos. in each genotype we compared the graded expression of the two genes quantitatively at several ages. to test whether defects in cdca <dig> expression in lateral cortical cells might contribute to the cellular defects in this region caused by pax <dig> loss, we electroporated a cdca <dig> expression vector into wild-type lateral cortex and examined the effect on the production of tbr2-expressing cells.


RESULTS
we found that cdca <dig> is co-expressed with pax <dig> in cortical progenitors, at levels opposite to those of pax <dig>  lowest levels of cdca <dig> are found in the radial glial progenitors of lateral cortex, where pax <dig> levels are highest. higher levels of cdca <dig> are found in ventral telencephalon, where pax <dig> levels are low. loss of pax <dig> causes cdca <dig> expression to increase in the lateral cortex. elevating cdca <dig> in normal lateral cortical progenitors to levels close to those normally found in ventral telencephalon reduces their production of tbr2-expressing cells early in lateral cortical formation.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that pax <dig> normally represses cdca <dig> expression in the lateral cortex and that repression of cdca <dig> in cells of this region is required for their production of a normal complement of tbr2-expressing intermediate progenitors.
