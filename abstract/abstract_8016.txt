BACKGROUND
ganoderma lucidum-derived polysaccharide  can rapidly and effectively promote the activation and maturation of immature dendritic cells , suggesting that ps-g possesses the capacity to regulate immune responses. this study aimed to clarify the immunologic effect of ps-g on monocyte-derived dendritic cells  from asthmatic children allergic to house dust mites. the md-dcs were stimulated for  <dig> h with the related allergen, der p  <dig>  in the presence or absence of ps-g. cell surface markers and phagocytic capacity were assessed by facs analysis, and key polarizing cytokines  were quantified. the subsequent regulatory effect of pulsed md-dcs on naïve t cells was evaluated by determining the t-cell cytokine profile.


RESULTS
ps-g induced the maturation of md-dcs and decreased phagocytic capacity, even if pulsed with der p  <dig>  after incubation with ps-g and der p  <dig>  md-dcs produced higher amounts of il- <dig> p <dig>  il- <dig> p <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il <dig> than der p 1-pulsed dcs. furthermore, type  <dig> helper t  cell cytokine  production was highly increased when naïve autologous t cells were co-cultured with der p 1-pulsed md-dcs. naïve t cells stimulated by md-dcs pulsed with der p  <dig> failed to produce proliferation of t-cells, whereas the addition of ps-g to der p  <dig> induced a significant proliferation of t-cells similar to that observed with ps-g alone.


CONCLUSIONS
the presence of ps-g in an allergen pulse promoted allergic md-dcs to produce il- <dig> p <dig>  il- <dig> p <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  and exerted an effect on shifting the immune balance towards th <dig> in children with allergic asthma.
