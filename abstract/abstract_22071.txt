BACKGROUND
understanding the transcriptional regulation mechanisms in response to environmental challenges is of fundamental importance in biology. transcription factors associated to response elements and the chromatin structure had proven to play important roles in gene expression regulation. we have analyzed promoter regions of dipteran genes induced in response to immune challenge, in search for particular sequence patterns involved in their transcriptional regulation.


RESULTS
5' upstream regions of d. melanogaster and a. gambiae immunity-induced genes and their corresponding orthologous genes in  <dig> non-melanogaster drosophilid species and ae. aegypti share enrichment in at-rich short motifs. at-rich motifs are associated with nucleosome formation as predicted by two different algorithms. in a. gambiae and d. melanogaster, many immunity genes 5' upstream sequences also showed nfκb response elements, located within  <dig> bp from the transcription start site. in a. gambiae, the frequency of ataa motif near the nfκb response elements was increased, suggesting a functional link between nucleosome formation/remodelling and nfκb regulation of transcription.


CONCLUSIONS
at-rich motif enrichment in 5' upstream sequences in a. gambiae, ae. aegypti and the drosophila genus immunity genes suggests a particular pattern of nucleosome formation/chromatin organization. the co-occurrence of such motifs with the nfκb response elements suggests that these sequence signatures may be functionally involved in transcriptional activation during dipteran immune response. at-rich motif enrichment in regulatory regions in this group of co-regulated genes could represent an evolutionary constrained signature in dipterans and perhaps other distantly species.
