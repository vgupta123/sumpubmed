BACKGROUND
gm <dig> and gm <dig> gangliosidoses are progressive neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases resulting from the excessive accumulation of gm <dig> and gm <dig> gangliosides in the lysosomes, respectively. the diagnosis of gangliosidosis is carried out based on comprehensive findings using various types of specimens for histological, ultrastructural, biochemical and genetic analyses. therefore, the partial absence or lack of specimens might have resulted in many undiagnosed cases. the aim of the present study was to establish immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent techniques for the auxiliary diagnosis of canine and feline gangliosidoses, using paraffin-embedded brain specimens stored for a long period.


RESULTS
using hematoxylin and eosin staining, cytoplasmic accumulation of pale to eosinophilic granular materials in swollen neurons was observed in animals previously diagnosed with gm <dig> or gm <dig> gangliosidosis. the immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent techniques developed in this study clearly demonstrated the accumulated material to be either gm <dig> or gm <dig> ganglioside.


CONCLUSIONS
immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent techniques using stored paraffin-embedded brain specimens are useful for the retrospective diagnosis of gm <dig> and gm <dig> gangliosidoses in dogs and cats.
