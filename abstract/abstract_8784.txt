BACKGROUND
in years past, methicillin-resistant s. aureus  has been frequently detected in pigs in europe, north america and asia. recent, yet sporadic studies have revealed a low occurrence of mrsa in switzerland. in  <dig>  a monitoring survey of the prevalence and genetic diversity of methicillin-resistant s. aureus  in slaughter pigs in switzerland was conducted using methods recommended by the eu guidelines, and using a sampling strategy evenly distributed throughout the year and representative of the swiss slaughter pig population. monitoring should determine if the overall prevalence of mrsa in the entire country is increasing over the years and if specific multi-resistant mrsa clones are spreading over the country.


RESULTS
in  <dig>  the nasal cavities of eight out of  <dig> randomly selected pigs were positive for mrsa, representing a prevalence of  <dig> % . the following year,  <dig> out of  <dig> pigs were positive for mrsa . three multilocus sequence types , four spa types and two types of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec  elements were detected. the most frequent genotypes were st <dig> -t034-v  and st49-t208-v , followed by st398-t011-v , st398-t1451-v , and st1-t2279-ivc . the isolates displayed resistance to ÃŸ-lactams ; tetracycline  ; macrolides and lincosamides  ; tiamulin  ; trimethoprim  ; streptomycin ; sulphamethoxazole  and ciprofloxacin  .


CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first to describe the presence of mrsa st <dig> in slaughter pigs, and to demonstrate a significant and nearly three-fold increase of mrsa prevalence in pigs within two years. the presence of a specific clonal lineage of mrsa from switzerland suggests that it has been selected in swiss pig husbandry. effective hygiene measures should be enhanced within the entire pig production chain to suppress the spread of these pathogens into the community.
