BACKGROUND
micrornas  have been shown to play important roles in regulating gene expression. since mirnas are often evolutionarily conserved and their precursors can be folded into stem-loop hairpins, many mirnas have been predicted. yet experimental confirmation is difficult since mirna expression is often specific to particular tissues and developmental stages.


RESULTS
analysis of  <dig> human and  <dig> mouse longsage libraries revealed the expression of  <dig> known and  <dig> predicted mammalian mirnas. most were detected in embryonic tissues. four sage tags detected in human embryonic stem cells specifically match a cluster of four human mirnas  known to be expressed in embryonic stem cells. longsage data also suggest the existence of a mouse homolog of human and rat mir- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the observation that some orphan longsage tags uniquely match mirna precursors provides information about the expression of some known and predicted mirnas.
