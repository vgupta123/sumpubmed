BACKGROUND
multiresistant gram-negative bacteria producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases  are an emerging problem in human and veterinary medicine. this study focused on comparative molecular characterization of β-lactamase and esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates from central hesse in germany. isolates originated from humans, companion animals  and horses.


RESULTS
in this study  <dig>  of the human isolates  and  <dig>  of the animal isolates  were confirmed as esbl producers by pcr and subsequent sequencing of the pcr amplicons. predominant esbl subtypes in human and animal samples were ctx-m- <dig>  and ctx-m- <dig>  respectively. subtype blactx-m- <dig> was found almost exclusively in equine and was absent from human isolates. the carbapenemase oxa- <dig> was detected in  <dig> ertapenem-resistant companion animal isolates in this study. the plasmid-encoded quinolone resistance  gene aac-ib-cr was the most frequently detected antibiotic- resistance gene present in  <dig> % of the human and  <dig> % of the animal ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates. combinations of two or up to six different resistance genes  were detected in 70% of all isolates investigated. the most frequent species in this study was escherichia coli , followed by klebsiella pneumoniae , and enterobacter cloacae . investigation of escherichia coli phylogenetic groups revealed underrepresentation of group b <dig> within the animal isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
isolates from human, companion animals and horses shared several characteristics regarding presence of esbl, pmqr and combination of different resistance genes. the results indicate active transmission and dissemination of multi-resistant enterobacteriaceae among human and animal populations.
