BACKGROUND
to assess the effectiveness of emergency vaccination for reducing the contact-induced infection and pathological damage caused by the highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus , twenty pigs were equally divided into four groups. groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were housed in one unit, whereas group  <dig> was separately housed. group  <dig> was challenged with hpprrsv on day  <dig>  group  <dig> and  <dig> did not receive treatment and were used as the contact-infected and uninfected controls, respectively. group  <dig> was treated with the attenuated vaccine at  <dig> days post-inoculation. the rectal temperatures, clinical signs, pathologic lesions and viraemia of the piglets were detected and evaluated.


RESULTS
the vaccinated pigs in group  <dig> showed less clinical morbidity, viraemia, temperature fluctuations and lung lesions at  <dig> days post-inoculation, as compared with the contact-infected  and experimentally infected  pigs. higher serum ifn-γ levels were detected among the pigs that received emergency immunisation. thus, ifn-γ may be involved in immunity against hpprrsv infection.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicated that emergency vaccination could effectively alleviate hpprrsv infection during experimental contact exposure. our findings provide a novel and useful strategy for controlling clinical hpprrsv.
