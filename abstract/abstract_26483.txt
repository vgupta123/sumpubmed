BACKGROUND
existing linkage maps of the bovine genome primarily contain anonymous microsatellite markers. these maps have proved valuable for mapping quantitative trait loci  to broad regions of the genome, but more closely spaced markers are needed to fine-map qtl, and markers associated with genes and annotated sequence are needed to identify genes and sequence variation that may explain qtl.


RESULTS
bovine expressed sequence tag  and bacterial artificial chromosome sequence data were used to develop  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphism  markers to map genes on the bovine linkage map. dna of sires from the marc reference population was used to detect snps, and progeny and mates of heterozygous sires were genotyped. chromosome assignments for  <dig> snps were determined by twopoint analysis, and positions for  <dig> snps were established by multipoint analyses. linkage maps of bovine autosomes with these snps represent  <dig> markers in  <dig> positions spanning  <dig> cm . markers include  <dig> microsatellites,  <dig> snps and  <dig> other markers. mean separation between marker positions is  <dig>  cm. new snp markers appear in  <dig> positions, with mean separation of  <dig>  cm. multi-allelic markers, mostly microsatellites, had a mean  of  <dig>  informative meioses, and a mean 3-lod confidence interval of  <dig>  cm bi-allelic markers, including snp and other marker types, had a mean  of  <dig>  informative meioses, and were placed within a mean  <dig>  cm 3-lod confidence interval. homologous human sequences were identified for  <dig> markers, including  <dig> newly developed and mapped snp.


CONCLUSIONS
addition of these est- and bac-based snps to the bovine linkage map not only increases marker density, but provides connections to gene-rich physical maps, including annotated human sequence. the map provides a resource for fine-mapping quantitative trait loci and identification of positional candidate genes, and can be integrated with other data to guide and refine assembly of bovine genome sequence. even after the bovine genome is completely sequenced, the map will continue to be a useful tool to link observable phenotypes and animal genotypes to underlying genes and molecular mechanisms influencing economically important beef and dairy traits.
