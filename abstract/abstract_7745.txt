BACKGROUND
genomic resources for the majority of free-living vertebrates of ecological and evolutionary importance are scarce. therefore, linkage maps with high-density genome coverage are needed for progress in genomics of wild species. the siberian jay  is a passerine bird which has been subject to lots of research in the areas of ecology and evolutionary biology. knowledge of its genome structure and organization is required to advance our understanding of the genetic basis of ecologically important traits in this species, as well as to provide insights into avian genome evolution.


RESULTS
we describe the first genetic linkage map of siberian jay constructed using  <dig> microsatellites and a mapping pedigree of  <dig> animals representing five families from a natural population breeding in western finland from the years  <dig> to  <dig>  markers were resolved into nine autosomal and a z-chromosome-specific linkage group,  <dig> markers remaining unlinked. the best-position map with the most likely positions of all significantly linked loci had a total sex-average size of  <dig>  cm, with an average interval distance of  <dig>  cm. the female map covered  <dig>  cm, whereas the male map covered only  <dig> cm. the z-chromosome linkage group comprised six markers, three pseudoautosomal and three sex-specific loci, and spanned  <dig>  cm in females and  <dig>  cm in males. eighty-one of the mapped loci could be ordered on a framework map with odds of >1000: <dig> covering a total size of  <dig>  cm in females and  <dig>  cm in males. significant sex specific distortions towards reduced male recombination rates were revealed in the entire best-position map as well as within two autosomal linkage groups. comparative mapping between siberian jay and chicken anchored  <dig> homologous loci on  <dig> different linkage groups corresponding to chicken chromosomes gga <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and z. quite a few cases of intra-chromosomal rearrangements within the autosomes and three cases of inter-chromosomal rearrangement between the siberian jay autosomal linkage groups  and the chicken sex chromosome ggaz were observed, suggesting a conserved synteny, but changes in marker order, within autosomes during about  <dig> million years of avian evolution.


CONCLUSIONS
the constructed linkage map represents a valuable resource for intraspecific genomics of siberian jay, as well as for avian comparative genomic studies. apart from providing novel insights into sex-specific recombination rates and patterns, the described maps – from a previously genomically uncharacterized superfamily  of passerine birds – provide new insights into avian genome evolution. in combination with high-resolution data on quantitative trait variability from the study population, they also provide a foundation for qtl-mapping studies.
