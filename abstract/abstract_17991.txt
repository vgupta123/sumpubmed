BACKGROUND
ultra conserved regions  are a class of  <dig> noncoding sequences located in both intra- and inter-genic regions of the genome. the recent findings that they are significantly altered in adult chronic lymphocytic leukemias, carcinomas, and pediatric neuroblastomas lead to the hypothesis that ucrs may play a role in tumorigenesis.


RESULTS
we present a novel application of ribo-spia™ isothermal linear amplification of minute rna quantities for quantifying transcribed-ucr  expression by quantitative pcr. direct comparison of non-amplified with amplified cdna in two neuroblastoma cell lines showed that the amplification approach increases sensitivity and repeatability in t-ucr quantification. it is noteworthy that the ribo-spia™ step allowed us to analyze all  <dig> t-ucrs by using  <dig> ng of rna, while introducing a minimal bias and preserving the magnitude of relative expression. only the less abundant t-ucrs have high intra-assay variability, consistently with the poisson distribution statistics and stochastic effects on pcr repeatability.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that the quantification procedure shown here is an accurate and reliable technique for genome-wide non coding gene  profiling using small amounts of rna. this issue is particularly important because studies of transcription regulation are increasingly conducted in small homogeneous samples, such as laser capture microdissected or sorted cell populations.
