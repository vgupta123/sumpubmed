BACKGROUND
the southeast asian deletion  is the most commonly observed mutation among diverse α-thalassemia alleles in southeast asia and south china. it is generally argued that mutation --sea, like other variants causing hemoglobin disorders, is associated with protection against malaria that is endemic in these regions. however, little evidence has been provided to support this claim.


RESULTS
we first examined the genetic imprint of recent positive selection on the --sea allele and flanking sequences in the human α-globin cluster, covering a genomic region spanning ~ <dig> kb, by genotyping  <dig> snps in a chinese population consisting of  <dig> --sea heterozygotes and  <dig> normal individuals. the pattern of linkage disequilibrium  and the long-range haplotype test revealed a signature of positive selection. the network of inferred haplotypes suggested a single origin of the --sea allele.


CONCLUSIONS
thus, our data support the hypothesis that the --sea allele has been subjected to recent balancing selection, triggered by malaria.
