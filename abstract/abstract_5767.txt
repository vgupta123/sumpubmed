BACKGROUND
anopheles  cruzii  is a primary vector of human and simian malaria parasites in southern and southeastern brazil. earlier studies using chromosome inversions, isoenzymes and a number of molecular markers have suggested that an. cruzii is a species complex.


RESULTS
in this study, a multilocus approach using six loci, three circadian clock genes and three encoding ribosomal proteins, was carried out to investigate in more detail the genetic differentiation between the an. cruzii populations from florianópolis–santa catarina  and itatiaia–rio de janeiro states . the analyses were performed first comparing florianópolis and itatiaia, and then comparing the two putative sympatric incipient species from itatiaia . the analysis revealed high fst values between florianópolis and itatiaia  and also between the sympatric itatiaia a and itatiaia b, irrespective of their function. also, using the im program, no strong indication of migration was found between florianópolis and itatiaia  using all loci together, but between itatiaia a and itatiaia b, the results show evidence of migration only in the direction of itatiaia b.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of the multilocus analysis indicate that florianópolis and itatiaia represent different species of the an. cruzii complex that diverged around  <dig>  mya, and also that the itatiaia sample is composed of two sympatric incipient species a and b, which diverged around  <dig>  mya. asymmetric introgression was found between the latter two species despite strong divergence in some loci.
