BACKGROUND
during respiratory viral infections host injury occurs due in part to inappropriate host responses. in this study we sought to uncover the host transcriptional responses underlying differences between high- and low-pathogenic infections.


RESULTS
from a compendium of  <dig> studies that included responses to influenza a subtype h5n <dig>  reconstructed  <dig> influenza a virus, and sars coronavirus, we used meta-analysis to derive multiple gene expression signatures. we compared these signatures by their capacity to segregate biological conditions by pathogenicity and predict pathogenicity in a test data set. the highest-performing signature was expressed as a continuum in low-, medium-, and high-pathogenicity samples, suggesting a direct, analog relationship between expression and pathogenicity. this signature comprised  <dig> genes including a subnetwork of chemokines, implicating dysregulated cell recruitment in injury.


CONCLUSIONS
highly pathogenic viruses elicit expression of many of the same key genes as lower pathogenic viruses but to a higher degree. this increased degree of expression may result in the uncontrolled co-localization of inflammatory cell types and lead to irreversible host damage.
