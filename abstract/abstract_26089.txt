BACKGROUND
single nucleotide polymorphisms  are ideal signatures for subtyping monomorphic pathogens such as bacillus anthracis. here we report the use of next-generation sequencing technology to investigate the historical, geographic and genetic diversity of bacillus anthracis in france.  <dig> strains isolated over a 60-years period throughout the country were whole-genome sequenced and comparative analyses were carried out with a focus on snps discovery to discriminate regional sub-groups of strains.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> chromosomal snps precisely establish the phylogenetic relationships existing between the french strains. phylogeography patterns within the three cansnp sub-lineages present in france  were observed. one of the more remarkable findings was the identification of a variety of genotypes within the a.br.011/ <dig> sub-group that are persisting in the different regions of france. the  <dig> snps defining the a.br.011/009- affiliated french strains split the trans-eurasian sub-group into six distinct branches without any intermediate nodes. distinct sub-branches, with some geographic clustering, were resolved. the  <dig> snps defining the major b.br cneva sub-lineage clustered three main phylogeographic clades, the alps, the pyrenees, and the massif central, with a small sa√¥ne-et-loire sub-cluster nested within the latter group. the french strains affiliated to the minor a.br.001/ <dig> group were characterized by  <dig> snps. all recent isolates collected from the doubs department were closely related. identification of snps from whole-genome sequences facilitates high-resolution strain tracking and provides the level of discrimination required for outbreak investigations. eight diagnostic snps, representative of the main french-specific phylogeographic clusters, were therefore selected and developed into high-resolution melting snp discriminative assays.


CONCLUSIONS
this work has established one of the most accurate phylogenetic reconstruction of b. anthracis population structure in a country. an extensive next-generation sequencing  dataset of  <dig> french strains have been created that allowed the identification of novel diagnostic snps useful to rapidly determine the geographic origin of any strain found in france.
