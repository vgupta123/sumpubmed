BACKGROUND
vernalization genes vrn <dig> play a major role in the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth in wheat. in di-, tetra- and hexaploid wheats the presence of a dominant allele of at least one vrn <dig> gene homologue  determines the spring growth habit. allelic variation between the vrn- <dig> and vrn- <dig> alleles relies on mutations in the promoter region or the first intron. the origin and variability of the dominant vrn <dig> alleles, determining the spring growth habit in tetraploid wheat species have been poorly studied.


RESULTS
here we analyzed the growth habit of  <dig> tetraploid wheat species accessions and 25 % of them were spring type. we analyzed the promoter and first intron regions of vrn <dig> genes in  <dig> spring accessions of tetraploid wheats. the spring growth habit of most studied spring accessions was determined by previously identified dominant alleles of vrn <dig> genes. genetic experiments proof the dominant inheritance of vrn-a1d allele which was widely distributed across the accessions of triticum dicoccoides. two novel alleles were discovered and designated as vrn-a1b. <dig> and vrn-b1dic. vrn-a1b. <dig> had deletions of 20 bp located 137 bp upstream of the start codon and mutations within the vrn-box when compared to the recessive allele of vrn-a <dig>  so far the vrn-a1d allele was identified only in spring accessions of the t. dicoccoides and t. turgidum species. vrn-b1dic was identified in t. dicoccoides ig <dig> and had 11 % sequence dissimilarity in comparison to the promoter of vrn-b <dig>  the presence of vrn-a1b. <dig> and vrn-b1dic alleles is a predicted cause of the spring growth habit of studied accessions of tetraploid species. three spring accessions t. aethiopicum k- <dig>  t. turanicum k- <dig> and t. turgidum cv. blancal possess recessive alleles of both vrn-a <dig> and vrn-b <dig> genes. further investigations are required to determine the source of spring growth habit of these accessions.


CONCLUSIONS
new allelic variants of the vrn-a <dig> and vrn-b <dig> genes were identified in spring accessions of tetraploid wheats. the origin and evolution of vrn-a <dig> alleles in di- and tetraploid wheat species was discussed.
