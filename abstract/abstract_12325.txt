BACKGROUND
most genetic disorders are linked to missense mutations as even minor changes in the size or properties of an amino acid can alter or prevent the function of the protein. further, the effect of a mutation is also dependent on the sequence and structure context of the alteration.


RESULTS
we investigated the spectrum of disease-causing missense mutations in secondary structure elements in proteins with numerous known mutations and for which an experimentally defined three-dimensional structure is available. we obtained a comprehensive map of the differences in mutation frequencies, location and contact energies, and the changes in residue volume and charge â€“ both in the mutated  amino acids and in the mutant amino acids in the different secondary structure types. we collected information for  <dig> different proteins involved in a large number of diseases. the studied proteins contained a total of  <dig> mutations of which  <dig>  appeared in secondary structures. differences in mutation patterns between secondary structures and whole proteins were generally not statistically significant whereas within the secondary structural elements numerous highly significant features were observed.


CONCLUSIONS
numerous trends in mutated and mutant amino acids are apparent. among the original residues, arginine clearly has the highest relative mutability. the overall relative mutability among mutant residues is highest for cysteine and tryptophan. the mutability values are higher for mutated residues than for mutant residues. arginine and glycine are among the most mutated residues in all secondary structures whereas the other amino acids have large variations in mutability between structure types. statistical analysis was used to reveal trends in different secondary structural elements, residue types as well as for the charge and volume changes.
