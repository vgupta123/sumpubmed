BACKGROUND
no systematic review has previously been carried out on randomised controlled trials  of veterinary homeopathy in which the control group was an intervention other than placebo . for eligible peer-reviewed rcts, the objectives of this study were to assess the risk of bias  and to quantify the effect size of homeopathic intervention compared with an active comparator or with no treatment.

methods
our systematic review approach complied fully with the prisma  <dig> checklist. cochrane methods were applied to assess rob and to derive effect size using standard meta-analysis methods. based on a thorough and systematic literature search, the following key attributes of the published research were distinguished: individualised homeopathy /non-individualised homeopathy ; treatment /prophylaxis ; active controls /untreated controls . the trials were highly diverse, representing  <dig> different medical conditions in  <dig> different species.


RESULTS
no trial had sufficiently low rob to be judged as reliable evidence:  <dig> of the  <dig> rcts had high rob; the remaining four had uncertain rob in several domains of assessment. for three trials with uncertain rob and without overt vested interest, it was inconclusive whether homeopathy combined with conventional intervention was more or was less effective than conventional intervention alone for modulation of immune response in calves, or in the prophylaxis of cattle tick or of diarrhoea in piglets.


CONCLUSIONS
due to the poor reliability of their data, otp-controlled trials do not currently provide useful insight into the effectiveness of homeopathy in animals.
