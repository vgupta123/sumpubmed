BACKGROUND
bluetongue virus  particles consist of seven structural proteins that are organized into two capsids. in addition, btv also encodes three non-structural  proteins of which protein  <dig>  is the rna binding protein and is also the major component of virus encoded inclusion bodies , which are believed to be virus assembly sites. to investigate the contribution of ns <dig> in virus replication and assembly we have constructed inducible mammalian cell lines expressing full-length ns <dig>  in addition, truncated ns <dig> fragments were also generated in an attempt to create dominant negative mutants for ns <dig> function.


RESULTS
our data revealed that expression of full-length ns <dig> was sufficient for the formation of inclusion bodies  that were morphologically similar to the vibs formed during btv infection. by using either, individual btv proteins or infectious virions, we found that while the vp <dig> of the inner capsid  that surrounds the transcription complex was closely associated with both ns <dig> ibs and btv vibs, the surface core protein vp <dig> co-localized with ns <dig> ibs only in the presence of vp <dig>  in contrast to the inner core proteins, the outer capsid protein vp <dig> was not associated with either ibs or vibs. like the core proteins, newly synthesized btv rnas also accumulated in vibs. unlike full-length ns <dig>  neither the amino-, nor carboxyl-terminal fragments formed complete ib structures and each appeared to interfere in overall virus replication when similarly expressed.


CONCLUSIONS
together, these data demonstrate that ns <dig> is sufficient and necessary for ib formation and a key player in virus replication and core assembly. perturbation of ns <dig> ib formation resulted in reduced virus synthesis and both the n terminal  and c terminal  fragments act as dominant negative mutants of ns <dig> function.
