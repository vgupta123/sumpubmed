BACKGROUND
aspergillus niger, a saprophyte commonly found on decaying vegetation, is widely used and studied for industrial purposes. despite its place as one of the most important organisms for commercial applications, the lack of available information about its genetic makeup limits research with this filamentous fungus.


RESULTS
we present here the analysis of  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  generated from a. niger cultured under seven different growth conditions. these ests identify about  <dig>  genes of which  <dig> % code for proteins sharing similarity  with genbank entries of known function, 38% code for proteins that only share similarity with genbank entries of unknown function and  <dig> % encode proteins that do not have a genbank homolog. using the gene ontology hierarchy, we present a first classification of the a. niger proteins encoded by these genes and compare its protein repertoire with other well-studied fungal species. we have established a searchable web-based database that includes the est and derived contig sequences and their annotation. details about this project and access to the annotated a. niger database are available.


CONCLUSIONS
this est collection and its annotation provide a significant resource for fundamental and applied research with a. niger. the gene set identified in this manuscript will be highly useful in the annotation of the genome sequence of a. niger, the genes described in the manuscript, especially those encoding hydrolytic enzymes will provide a valuable source for researchers interested in enzyme properties and applications.
