BACKGROUND
sigma <dig>  or rpon, is an alternative σ factor found widely in eubacteria. a significant complication in analysis of the global σ <dig> regulon in a bacterium is that the σ <dig> rna polymerase holoenzyme requires interaction with an active bacterial enhancer-binding protein  to initiate transcription at a σ54-dependent promoter. many bacteria possess multiple bebps, which are activated by diverse environmental stimuli. in this work, we assess the ability of a promiscuous, constitutively-active bebp—the aaa+ atpase domain of dctd from sinorhizobium meliloti—to activate transcription from all σ54-dependent promoters for the characterization of the σ <dig> regulon of salmonella typhimurium lt <dig> 


RESULTS
the aaa+ atpase domain of dctd was able to drive transcription from nearly all previously characterized or predicted σ54-dependent promoters in salmonella under a single condition. these promoters are controlled by a variety of native activators and, under the condition tested, are not transcribed in the absence of the dctd aaa+ atpase domain. we also identified a novel σ54-dependent promoter upstream of stm <dig>  a homolog of the cas <dig> component of a crispr system. chip-chip analysis revealed at least  <dig> σ <dig> binding sites in the chromosome, of which 58% are located within coding sequences. promoter-lacz fusions with selected intragenic σ <dig> binding sites suggest that many of these sites are capable of functioning as σ54-dependent promoters.


CONCLUSIONS
since the dctd aaa+ atpase domain proved effective in activating transcription from the diverse σ54-dependent promoters of the s. typhimurium lt <dig> σ <dig> regulon under a single growth condition, this approach is likely to be valuable for examining σ <dig> regulons in other bacterial species. the s. typhimurium σ <dig> regulon included a high number of intragenic σ <dig> binding sites/promoters, suggesting that σ <dig> may have multiple regulatory roles beyond the initiation of transcription at the start of an operon.
