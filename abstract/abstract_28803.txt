BACKGROUND
we have shown previously that acute infection with the respiratory pathogen, pneumonia virus of mice , results in local production of the proinflammatory chemokine, ccl <dig>  and that neutrophil recruitment in response to pvm infection is reduced dramatically in ccl <dig> -/- mice.


RESULTS
in this work, we demonstrate that ccl3-mediated neutrophil recruitment is coordinated by interferon-gamma . neutrophil recruitment in response to pvm infection was diminished five-fold in ifnγ receptor gene-deleted mice, although neutrophils from ifnγr -/- mice expressed transcripts for the ccl <dig> receptor, ccr <dig> and responded functionally to ccl <dig> ex vivo. similarly, in the absence of pvm infection, ccl <dig> overexpression alone could not elicit neutrophil recruitment in the absence of ifnγ. interestingly, although supplemental ifnγ restored neutrophil recruitment and resulted in a sustained weight loss among ccl3-overexpressing ifnγ -/- mice, ccl3-mediated neutrophil recruitment alone did not result in the pulmonary edema or respiratory failure characteristic of severe viral infection, suggesting that ccl <dig> and ifn-γ together are sufficient to promote neutrophil recruitment but not pathologic activation.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings reveal a heretofore unrecognized hierarchical interaction between the ifnγ and ccl <dig>  which demonstrate that ifnγ is crucial for ccl3-mediated neutrophil recruitment in vivo.
