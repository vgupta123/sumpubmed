BACKGROUND
canine mammary sarcomas  are rarely diagnosed in female dogs, which explains the scarcity of immunohistochemical findings concerning those tumors. this paper presents the results of a retrospective study into cmss and discusses the clinical features of the analyzed tumors, the expression of intermediate filaments ck, vim, des and α-sma, and the expression of p <dig>  ki <dig>  erα, pr and p <dig> protein.


RESULTS
four percent of all canine mammary tumors  were classified as cmss, and they represented  <dig> % of malignant cmts. the mean age at diagnosis was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years. large breed dogs were more frequently affected . the majority of observed cmss were fibrosarcomas . all cmss expressed vimentin, and higher levels of vimentin expression were noted in fibrosarcomas and osteosarcomas. ki <dig> expression was significantly correlated with the grade of cms.


CONCLUSIONS
our results revealed that cmss form a heterogeneous group, therefore, immunohistochemical examinations could support differential and final diagnosis. although this study analyzed a limited number of samples, the reported results can expand our knowledge about cmss. further work is required in this field.
