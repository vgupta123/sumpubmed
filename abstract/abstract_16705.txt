BACKGROUND
focal clusters of slow wave activity in the delta frequency range , as measured by magnetencephalography , are usually located in the vicinity of structural damage in the brain. such oscillations are usually considered pathological and indicative of areas incapable of normal functioning owing to deafferentation from relevant input sources. in the present study we investigated the change in delta dipole density in  <dig> patients with chronic aphasia  following cerebrovascular stroke of the left hemisphere before and after intensive speech and language therapy .


RESULTS
neuropsychologically assessed language functions improved significantly after training. perilesional delta activity decreased after therapy in  <dig> of the  <dig> patients, while an increase was evident in  <dig> patients. the magnitude of change of delta activity in these areas correlated with the amount of change in language functions as measured by standardized language tests.


CONCLUSIONS
these results emphasize the significance of perilesional areas in the rehabilitation of aphasia even years after the stroke, and might reflect reorganisation of the language network that provides the basis for improved language functions after intensive training.
