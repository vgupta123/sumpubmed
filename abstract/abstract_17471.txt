BACKGROUND
as the predominant secondary metabolic pathway in tea plants, flavonoid biosynthesis increases with increasing temperature and illumination. however, the concentration of most flavonoids decreases greatly in light-sensitive tea leaves when they are exposed to light, which further improves tea quality. to reveal the metabolism and potential functions of flavonoids in tea leaves, a natural light-sensitive tea mutant  cultivated under different light conditions was subjected to metabolomics analysis.


RESULTS
the results showed that chlorotic tea leaves accumulated large amounts of flavonoids with ortho-dihydroxylated b-rings , whereas total flavonoids  were considerably reduced, suggesting that the flavonoid components generated from different metabolic branches played different roles in tea leaves. furthermore, the intracellular localization of flavonoids and the expression pattern of genes involved in secondary metabolic pathways indicate a potential photoprotective function of dihydroxylated flavonoids in light-sensitive tea leaves.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that reactive oxygen species  scavenging and the antioxidation effects of flavonoids help chlorotic tea plants survive under high light stress, providing new evidence to clarify the functional roles of flavonoids, which accumulate to high levels in tea plants. moreover, flavonoids with ortho-dihydroxylated b-rings played a greater role in photo-protection to improve the acclimatization of tea plants.
