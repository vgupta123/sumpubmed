BACKGROUND
periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by the microbiota of the periodontal pocket. we investigated the association between subgingival bacterial profiles and gene expression patterns in gingival tissues of patients with periodontitis. a total of  <dig> patients undergoing periodontal surgery contributed with a minimum of two interproximal gingival papillae  from a maxillary posterior region. prior to tissue harvesting, subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesial and distal aspects of each tissue sample. gingival tissue rna was extracted, reverse-transcribed, labeled, and hybridized with whole-genome microarrays . plaque samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations with respect to  <dig> bacterial species. random effects linear regression models considered bacterial levels as exposure and expression profiles as outcome variables. gene ontology analyses summarized the expression patterns into biologically relevant categories.


RESULTS
wide inter-species variation was noted in the number of differentially expressed gingival tissue genes according to subgingival bacterial levels: using a bonferroni correction ,  <dig>  probe sets were differentially associated with levels of tannerella forsythia,  <dig>  with porphyromonas gingivalis,  <dig>  with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  <dig> with eikenella corrodens and only  <dig> with actinomyces naeslundii. cluster analysis identified commonalities and differences among tissue gene expression patterns differentially regulated according to bacterial levels.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that the microbial content of the periodontal pocket is a determinant of gene expression in the gingival tissues and provide new insights into the differential ability of periodontal species to elicit a local host response.
