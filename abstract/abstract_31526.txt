BACKGROUND
while ngs allows rapid global detection of transcripts, it remains difficult to distinguish ncrnas from short mrnas. to detect potentially translated rnas, we developed an improved protocol for bacterial ribosomal footprinting . this allowed distinguishing ncrna from mrna in ehec. a high ratio of ribosomal footprints per transcript  is expected to indicate a translated rna, while a low rcv should point to a non-translated rna.


RESULTS
based on their low rcv,  <dig> novel non-translated ehec transcripts were identified as putative ncrnas, representing both antisense and intergenic transcripts,  <dig> of which had expressed homologs in e. coli mg <dig>  bioinformatics analysis predicted statistically significant target regulons for  <dig> of the intergenic transcripts; experimental analysis revealed 4-fold or higher differential expression of  <dig> novel ncrna in different growth media. out of  <dig> annotated ehec ncrnas,  <dig> showed an rcv similar to protein-coding genes, of those,  <dig> had riboseq patterns matching annotated genes in other enterobacteriaceae, and  <dig> seem to possess a shine-dalgarno sequence, suggesting that such ncrnas may encode small proteins instead of being solely non-coding. to support that the riboseq signals are reflecting translation, we tested the ribosomal-footprint covered orf of ryhb and found a phenotype for the encoded peptide in iron-limiting condition.


CONCLUSIONS
determination of the rcv is a useful approach for a rapid first-step differentiation between bacterial ncrnas and small mrnas. further, many known ncrnas may encode proteins as well.
