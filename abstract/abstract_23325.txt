BACKGROUND
population stratification is a systematic difference in allele frequencies between subpopulations. this can lead to spurious association findings in the case–control genome wide association studies  used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms  associated with disease-linked phenotypes. methods such as self-declared ancestry, ancestry informative markers, genomic control, structured association, and principal component analysis are used to assess and correct population stratification but each has limitations. we provide an alternative technique to address population stratification.


RESULTS
we propose a novel machine learning method, ethnopred, which uses the genotype and ethnicity data from the hapmap project to learn ensembles of disjoint decision trees, capable of accurately predicting an individual’s continental and sub-continental ancestry. to predict an individual’s continental ancestry, ethnopred produced an ensemble of  <dig> decision trees involving a total of  <dig> snps, with 10-fold cross validation accuracy of 100% using hapmap ii dataset. we extended this model to involve  <dig> disjoint decision trees over  <dig> snps, and showed that this ensemble has an accuracy of ≥  <dig> %, even if some of those  <dig> snp values were missing. on an independent dataset, predominantly of caucasian origin, our continental classifier showed  <dig> % accuracy and improved genomic control’s λ from  <dig>  to  <dig> . we next used the hapmap iii dataset to learn classifiers to distinguish european subpopulations , east asian subpopulations , african subpopulations , north american subpopulations , and kenyan subpopulations . in these cases, ethnopred produced ensembles of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> disjoint decision trees, respectively involving  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> snps, with 10-fold cross validation accuracy of  <dig> % ±  <dig> %,  <dig> % ±  <dig> %,  <dig> % ±  <dig> %,  <dig> % ±  <dig> %, and  <dig> % ±  <dig> %. however, ethnopred was unable to produce a classifier that can accurately distinguish chinese in beijing vs. chinese in denver.


CONCLUSIONS
ethnopred is a novel technique for producing classifiers that can identify an individual’s continental and sub-continental heritage, based on a small number of snps. we show that its learned classifiers are simple, cost-efficient, accurate, transparent, flexible, fast, applicable to large scale gwass, and robust to missing values.
