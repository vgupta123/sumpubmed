BACKGROUND
h-ns is a dna-binding protein with central roles in gene regulation and nucleoid structuring in escherichia coli. there are over  <dig> genes that are influenced by h-ns many of which are involved in metabolism. to determine the significance of h-ns-regulated genes in metabolism and stress tolerance, an hns mutant of e. coli o157:h <dig> was generated  and its growth, metabolism, and gastrointestinal passage compared to the parent strain  and strain frik47001p harboring psc <dig> which contains a functional hns and 90-bp upstream of the open-reading frame.


RESULTS
the hns mutant grew slower and was non-motile in comparison to the parent strain. carbon and nitrogen metabolism was significantly altered in the hns mutant, which was incapable of utilizing  <dig> carbon, and  <dig> nitrogen sources that the parent strain metabolized. among the non-metabolized substrates were several amino acids, organic acids, and key metabolic intermediates  that limit carbon acquisition and energy generation. growth studies determined that the parent strain grew in lb containing  <dig> to 15% bile or bile salts, while the hns mutant grew in  <dig>  and 9% of these compounds, respectively. conversely, log-phase cells of the hns mutant were significantly  more acid tolerant than the parent strain and hns mutant complemented with psc <dig>  in mouse passage studies, the parent strain was recovered at a higher frequency  than the hns mutant regardless of whether log- or stationary-phase phase cells were orally administered.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate that h-ns is a powerful regulator of carbon and nitrogen metabolism as well as tolerance to bile salts. it is likely that the metabolic impairments and/or the reduced bile tolerance of the e. coli o157:h <dig> hns mutant decreased its ability to survive passage through mice. collectively, these results expand the influence of h-ns on carbon and nitrogen metabolism and highlight its role in the ability of o157:h <dig> strains to respond to changing nutrients and conditions encountered in the environment and its hosts.
