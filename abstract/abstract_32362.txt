BACKGROUND
a large number of genetic variations have been identified in rice. such variations must in many cases control phenotypic differences in abiotic stress tolerance and other traits. a single feature polymorphism  is an oligonucleotide array-based polymorphism which can be used for identification of snps or insertion/deletions  for high throughput genotyping and high density mapping. here we applied sfp markers to a lingering question about the source of salt tolerance in a particular rice recombinant inbred line  derived from a salt tolerant and salt sensitive parent.


RESULTS
expression data obtained by hybridizing rna to an oligonucleotide array were analyzed using a statistical method called robustified projection pursuit . by applying the rpp method, a total of  <dig> sfp probes were detected between two presumed parental genotypes  of a ril population segregating for salt tolerance. we focused on the saltol region, a major salt tolerance qtl. analysis of fl <dig>  a salt tolerant ril, revealed a small  region carrying alleles from the presumed salt tolerant parent, flanked by alleles matching the salt sensitive parent ir <dig>  sequencing of putative sfp-containing amplicons from this region and other positions in the genome yielded a validation rate more than 95%.


CONCLUSIONS
recombinant inbred line fl <dig> contains a small  segment from the salt tolerant parent in the saltol region. the affymetrix rice genome array provides a satisfactory platform for high resolution mapping in rice using rna hybridization and the rpp method of sfp analysis.
