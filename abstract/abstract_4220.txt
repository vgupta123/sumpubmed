BACKGROUND
vitellogenin is a well established biomarker for estrogenic exposure in fish. however, effects on gonadal differentiation at concentrations of estrogen not sufficient to give rise to a measurable vitellogenin response suggest that more sensitive biomarkers would be useful. induction of zona pellucida genes may be more sensitive but their specificities are not as clear. the objective of this study was to find additional sensitive and robust candidate biomarkers of estrogenic exposure.


RESULTS
hepatic mrna expression profiles were characterized in juvenile rainbow trout exposed to a measured concentration of  <dig>  and  <dig> ng ethinylestradiol/l using a salmonid cdna microarray. the higher concentration was used to guide the subsequent identification of generally more subtle responses at the low concentration not sufficient to induce vitellogenin. a meta-analysis was performed with data from the present study and three similar microarray studies using different fish species and platforms. within the generated list of presumably robust responses, several well-known estrogen-regulated genes were identified. two genes, confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr , fulfilled both the criteria of high sensitivity and robustness; the induction of the genes encoding zona pellucida protein  <dig> and a nucleoside diphosphate kinase .


CONCLUSIONS
the cross-species, cross-platform meta-analysis correctly identified several robust responses. this adds confidence to our approach used for identifying candidate biomarkers. specifically, we propose that analyses of an nm <dig> gene together with zona pellucida genes may increase the possibilities to detect an exposure to low levels of estrogenic compounds in fish.
