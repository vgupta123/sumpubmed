BACKGROUND
several observations support the hypothesis that vector-driven selection plays an important role in shaping dengue virus  genetic diversity. clustering of denv genetic diversity at a particular location may reflect underlying genetic structure of vector populations, which combined with specific vector genotype × virus genotype  interactions may promote adaptation of viral lineages to local mosquito vector genotypes. although spatial structure of vector polymorphism at neutral genetic loci is well-documented, existence of g × g interactions between mosquito and virus genotypes has not been formally demonstrated in natural populations. here we measure g × g interactions in a system representative of a natural situation in thailand by challenging three isofemale families from field-derived aedes aegypti with three contemporaneous low-passage isolates of denv- <dig> 


RESULTS
among indices of vector competence examined, the proportion of mosquitoes with a midgut infection, viral rna concentration in the body, and quantity of virus disseminated to the head/legs  strongly depended on the specific combinations of isofemale families and viral isolates, demonstrating significant g × g interactions.


CONCLUSIONS
evidence for genetic specificity of interactions in our simple experimental design indicates that vector competence of ae. aegypti for denv is likely governed to a large extent by g × g interactions in genetically diverse, natural populations. this result challenges the general relevance of conclusions from laboratory systems that consist of a single combination of mosquito and denv genotypes. combined with earlier evidence for fine-scale genetic structure of natural ae. aegypti populations, our finding indicates that the necessary conditions for local denv adaptation to mosquito vectors are met.
