BACKGROUND
automated microscopy technologies have led to a rapid growth in imaging data on a scale comparable to that of the genomic revolution. high throughput screens are now being performed to determine the localisation of all of proteins in a proteome. closer to the bench, large image sets of proteins in treated and untreated cells are being captured on a daily basis to determine function and interactions. hence there is a need for new methodologies and protocols to test for difference in subcellular imaging both to remove bias and enable throughput. here we introduce a novel method of statistical testing, and supporting software, to give a rigorous test for difference in imaging. we also outline the key questions and steps in establishing an analysis pipeline.


RESULTS
the methodology is tested on a high throughput set of images of  <dig> subcellular localisations, and it is shown that the localisations may be distinguished to a statistically significant degree with as few as  <dig> images of each. further, subtle changes in a protein's distribution between nocodazole treated and control experiments are shown to be detectable. the effect of outlier images is also examined and it is shown that while the significance of the test may be reduced by outliers this may be compensated for by utilising more images. finally, the test is compared to previous work and shown to be more sensitive in detecting difference. the methodology has been implemented within the icluster system for visualising and clustering bio-image sets.


CONCLUSIONS
the aim here is to establish a methodology and protocol for testing for difference in subcellular imaging, and to provide tools to do so. while icluster is applicable to moderate  size image sets, the statistical test is simple to implement and will readily be adapted to high throughput pipelines to provide more sensitive discrimination of difference.
