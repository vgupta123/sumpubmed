BACKGROUND
we describe the development of a novel matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight -based single nucleotide polymorphism  scoring strategy, termed restriction fragment mass polymorphism  that is suitable for genotyping variations in a simple, accurate, and high-throughput manner. the assay is based on polymerase chain reaction  amplification and mass measurement of oligonucleotides containing a polymorphic base, to which a typeiis restriction endonuclease recognition was introduced by pcr amplification. enzymatic cleavage of the products leads to excision of oligonucleotide fragments representing base variation of the polymorphic site whose masses were determined by maldi-tof ms.


RESULTS
the assay represents an improvement over previous methods because it relies on the direct mass determination of pcr products rather than on an indirect analysis, where a base-extended or fluorescent report tag is interpreted. the rfmp strategy is simple and straightforward, requiring one restriction digestion reaction following target amplification in a single vessel. with this technology, genotypes are generated with a high call rate  and high accuracy  as determined by independent sequencing.


CONCLUSIONS
the simplicity, accuracy and amenability to high-throughput screening analysis should make the rfmp assay suitable for large-scale genotype association study as well as clinical genotyping in laboratories.
