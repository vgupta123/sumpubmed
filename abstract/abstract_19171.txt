BACKGROUND
several inflammatory cytokines play a key part in the induction of osteoporosis. until now, involvement of the th <dig> cytokine interleukin- <dig>  in osteoporosis hadn’t yet been studied. il- <dig> is a proinflammatory cytokine mediating multiple immune functions, whose involvement in a wide range of diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, inflammatory bowel diseases and cutaneous lymphomas, is now emerging. given the important role of il- <dig> in inflammation, we measured its serum levels in postmenopausal osteoporotic patients.

RESULTS
in fifty-six postmenopausal females with osteoporosis and  <dig> healthy controls, bone mineral density  measurements were performed by using calcaneal quantitative ultrasound  technique, confirmed at the lumbar spine and hip by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry . both patients and controls were divided according to age  and disease severity . serum il- <dig> levels were measured by elisa technique. osteoporotic patients exhibited elevated levels of serum il- <dig> compared with healthy controls . il- <dig> expression was higher in over 65 years old patients compared to age-matched controls , whereas in younger subjects no statistically significant differences were detected between patients and controls . no statistically significant differences were found between il- <dig> levels in patients affected by mild  compared to severe  osteoporosis , neither between fractured and unfractured osteoporotic women .


CONCLUSIONS
we showed for the first time an increase of il- <dig> serum levels in postmenopausal women with decreased bmd. although they did not reflect the severity of osteoporosis and/or the presence of fractures, they clearly correlated with age, as reflected by the higher levels of this cytokine in aged patients.
