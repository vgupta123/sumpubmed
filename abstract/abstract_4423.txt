BACKGROUND
β-lactamase conjugated with environment-sensitive fluorescein molecule to residue  <dig> on the Ω-loop near its catalytic site is a highly effective biosensor for β-lactam antibiotics. yet the molecular mechanism of such fluorescence-based biosensing is not well understood.


RESULTS
here we report the crystal structure of a class a β-lactamase penp from bacillus licheniformis 749/c with fluorescein conjugated at residue  <dig> after e166c mutation, both in apo form  and in covalent complex form with cefotaxime , to illustrate its biosensing mechanism. in the apo structure the fluorescein molecule partially occupies the antibiotic binding site and is highly dynamic. in the penp-e166cf-cefatoxime complex structure the binding and subsequent acylation of cefotaxime to penp displaces fluorescein from its original location to avoid steric clash. such displacement causes the well-folded Ω-loop to become fully flexible and the conjugated fluorescein molecule to relocate to a more solvent exposed environment, hence enhancing its fluorescence emission. furthermore, the fully flexible Ω-loop enables the narrow-spectrum penp enzyme to bind cefotaxime in a mode that resembles the extended-spectrum β-lactamase.


CONCLUSIONS
our structural studies indicate the biosensing mechanism of a fluorescein-labelled β-lactamase. such findings confirm our previous proposal based on molecular modelling and provide useful information for the rational design of β-lactamase-based biosensor to detect the wide spectrum of β-lactam antibiotics. the observation of increased Ω-loop flexibility upon conjugation of fluorophore may have the potential to serve as a screening tool for novel β-lactamase inhibitors that target the Ω-loop and not the active site.
