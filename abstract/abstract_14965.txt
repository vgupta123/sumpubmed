BACKGROUND
the milk fat profile of the danish holstein  and danish jersey  show clear differences. identification of the genomic regions, genes and biological pathways underlying the milk fat biosynthesis will improve the understanding of the biology underlying bovine milk fat production and may provide new possibilities to change the milk fat composition by selective breeding. in this study a genome wide association scan  in the dh and dj was performed for a detailed milk fatty acid  profile using the hd bovine snp array and subsequently a biological pathway analysis based on the snp data was performed.


RESULTS
the gwas identified in total  <dig>  snps  spread over  <dig> chromosomes for nine different fa traits for the dh breed and  <dig>  snps  spread over  <dig> chromosomes for  <dig> different fa traits were detected for the dj breed. of these significant snps,  <dig> snp markers were significant in both dh and dj , bta14). this was supported by an enrichment test. the qtl on bta <dig> and bta <dig> represented the known candidate genes dgat and scd. in addition we suggest acss <dig> to be a good candidate gene for the qtl on bta <dig> for c10: <dig> and c15: <dig>  in addition, genetic correlations between the fa traits within breed showed large similarity across breeds. furthermore, the biological pathway analysis revealed that fat digestion and absorption  plays a role for the traits fp, c14: <dig>  c <dig> index and c16: <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
there was a clear similarity between the underlying genetics of fa in the milk between dh and dj. this was supported by the fact that there was substantial overlap between snps for fp, c <dig> index, c14: <dig>  c <dig> index and c16: <dig>  in addition genetic correlations between fa showed a similar pattern across dh and dj. furthermore the biological pathway analysis suggested that fat digestion and absorption kegg <dig> is important for the traits fp, c14: <dig>  c <dig> index and c16: <dig>
