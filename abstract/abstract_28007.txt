BACKGROUND
rapeseed  is one of the most important oil seed crops in the world, it is also one of the most common oil for production of biodiesel. its oil is a mixture of various fatty acids and dissection of the genetic network for fatty acids biosynthesis is of great importance for improving seed quality.


RESULTS
the genetic basis of fatty acid biosynthesis in b. napus was investigated via quantitative trail locus  analysis using a doubled haploid  population with  <dig> lines. a total of  <dig> individual qtls and a large number pairs of epistatic interactions associated with the content of  <dig> different fatty acids were detected. a total of  <dig> homologous genes of arabidopsis thaliana that are involved in fatty acid metabolism were found within the confidence intervals  of  <dig> qtls. among them,  <dig> and  <dig> genes homologous to those of b. rapa and b. oleracea were detected, respectively. after the qtl mapping, the epistatic and the candidate gene interaction analysis, a potential regulatory pathway controlling fatty acid biosynthesis in b. napus was constructed, including  <dig> enzymes encoded genes and five regulatory factors . subsequently, the interaction between these five regulatory factors and the genes involved in fatty acid metabolism were analyzed.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a potential regulatory pathway controlling the fatty acid was constructed by qtl analysis and in silico mapping analysis. these results enriched our knowledge of qtls for fatty acids metabolism and provided a new clue for genetic engineering fatty acids composition in b. napus.
