BACKGROUND
although a number of leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase-encoding genes  have been identified in plants, a functional role has been determined for only a few. recent studies have demonstrated that an lrr-rlk, pxy/tdr, is important for the process of secondary vascular development. other studies have indicated that pxy/tdr is unlikely to be the sole lrr-rlk involved in this complex process.


RESULTS
in this study, in silico analyses led to the identification of three arabidopsis lrr-rlk genes  with transcript accumulation profiles that correlated strongly with several key regulators of vascular development, including pxy/tdr, hb- <dig>  rev, and cle <dig>  expression profiling using qpcr and promoter:reporter lines indicated that all three pxc genes are associated with the vasculature. one in particular, pxc <dig> , had a strong correlation with pxy/tdr. shifting pxc <dig> mutants from long-days to short-days showed that loss of the gene led to a dramatic reduction in secondary wall formation in xylem fibers. transcript analysis of mutants for a variety of secondary cell wall-associated genes, including pxy/tdr indicated that the pathways mediated by pxc <dig> connect with those mediated by the tdif-pxy/tdr-wox <dig> system.


CONCLUSIONS
the data indicate that the lrr-rlk, pxc <dig> is involved in secondary cell wall formation in xylem fibers. whereas further study is needed to identify the ligands and mode of action of the pxc <dig> protein, it is clear from this work that similarly to the shoot apical meristem , secondary vascular development requires contributions from a number of lrr-rlks.
