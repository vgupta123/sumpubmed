BACKGROUND
the study on the second generation bio-fuel is a hot area of current research of renewable energy. among series of key points in this area, the role of β-glucosidase in the degradation of intermediate gluco-oligosaccharides limits the rate of the complete saccharification of lignocellulose.


RESULTS
in this study, a new β-glucosidase gene, unglu135b <dig>  which was isolated from a metagenomic library of rumen of cattle feeding with miscanthus sinensis by the function-based screening, encodes a  <dig> amino acid polypeptide that contains a catalytic domain belonging to glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> . it was recombinantly expressed, purified and biochemically characterized. the recombinant β-glucosidase, unglu135b <dig>  displayed optimum enzymatic activity at ph  <dig>  at 38°c, and showed the highest specific activity of  <dig>  ×  <dig> u/mg under this optimal condition to p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside , and its km and vmax values were  <dig>  mmol/l and  <dig>  μmol/min, respectively. in addition, the presence of ca2+, k+, na+ slightly improved β-glucosidase activity of unglu135b <dig> by about 5%, while about 10 ~ 85% loss of β-glucosidase activity was induced by addition of mn2+, fe3+, zn2+, cu2+. interestingly, unglu135b <dig> was activated by glucose at the concentration lower than 40 mm.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate that unglu135b <dig> is a new β-glucosidase derived from rumen of cattle, and it might be a potent candidate for saccharification of lignocellulose in industrial application.
