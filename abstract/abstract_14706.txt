BACKGROUND
sacha inchi  is a potential oilseed crop because the seeds of this plant are rich in unsaturated fatty acids . in particular, the fatty acid composition of its seed oil differs markedly in containing large quantities of Î±-linolenic acid . however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms responsible for biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in the developing seeds of this species. transcriptome data are needed to better understand these mechanisms.


RESULTS
in this study, de novo transcriptome assembly and gene expression analysis were performed using illumina sequencing technology. a total of  <dig>  million 90-bp paired-end reads were generated from two libraries constructed at the initial stage and fast oil accumulation stage of seed development. these reads were assembled into  <dig>  unigenes;  <dig>  unigenes showed a 2-fold or greater expression difference between the two libraries. using this data we identified unigenes that may be involved in de novo fa and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. in particular, a number of unigenes encoding desaturase for formation of unsaturated fatty acids with high expression levels in the fast oil accumulation stage compared with the initial stage of seed development were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides the first comprehensive dataset characterizing sacha inchi gene expression at the transcriptional level. these data provide the foundation for further studies on molecular mechanisms underlying oil accumulation and pufa biosynthesis in sacha inchi seeds. our analyses facilitate understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the high unsaturated fatty acids  accumulation in sacha inchi seeds.
