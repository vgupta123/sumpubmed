BACKGROUND
the influence of electromagnetic fields on the health of humans and animals is still an intensively discussed and scientifically investigated issue . we are surrounded by numerous electromagnetic fields of variable strength, coming from electronic equipment and its power cords, from high-voltage power lines and from antennas for radio, television and mobile communication. particularly the latter cause’s controversy, as everyone likes to have good mobile reception at anytime and anywhere, whereas nobody wants to have such a basestation antenna in their proximity.


RESULTS
in this experiment, the nir has resulted in changes in the enzyme activities. certain enzymes were disabled, others enabled by nir. furthermore, individual behavior patterns were observed. while certain cows reacted to nir, others did not react at all, or even inversely.


CONCLUSIONS
the present results coincide with the information from the literature, according to which nir leads to changes in redox proteins, and that there are individuals who are sensitive to radiation and others that are not. however, the latter could not be distinctly attributed – there are cows that react clearly with one enzyme while they do not react with another enzyme at all, or even the inverse. the study approach of testing ten cows each ten times during three phases has proven to be appropriate. future studies should however set the post-exposure phase later on.
