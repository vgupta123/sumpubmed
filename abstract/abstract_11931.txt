BACKGROUND
in c. elegans, single nucleotide polymorphisms  can function as silent genetic markers, with applications ranging from classical two- and three-factor mapping to measuring recombination across whole chromosomes.


RESULTS
here, we describe a set of  <dig> primer pairs that flank snps evenly spaced across the c. elegans genome and that work under identical pcr conditions. each snp in this set alters a drai site, enabling rapid and parallel scoring. we describe a procedure using these reagents to quickly and reliably map mutations. we show that these techniques correctly map a known gene, dpy- <dig>  we then use these techniques to map mutations in an uncharacterized strain, and show that its behavioral phenotype can be simultaneously mapped to three loci.


CONCLUSIONS
together, the reagents and methods described represent a significant advance in the accurate, rapid and inexpensive mapping of genes in c. elegans.
