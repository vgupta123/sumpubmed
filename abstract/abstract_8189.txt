BACKGROUND
epigenetics refers to the reversible functional modifications of the genome that do not correlate to changes in the dna sequence. the aim of this study is to understand dna methylation patterns across different stages of lung adenocarcinoma .


RESULTS
our study identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> significant dna methylated genes in stages i, ii and iii respectively. a set of common  <dig> significant dna methylated genes located in the promoter section of the true cpg islands were found across stages, and these were: hox genes, foxg <dig>  grik <dig>  hand <dig>  prkcb, etc. of the total significant dna methylated genes,  <dig> correlated with transcription function. the epigenetic analysis identified the following novel genes across all stages: ptgdr, tlx <dig>  and pou4f <dig>  the stage-wise analysis observed the appearance of neurog <dig> gene in stage i and its re-appearance in stage iii. the analysis showed similar epigenetic pattern across stage i and stage iii. pathway analysis revealed important signaling and metabolic pathways of luad to correlate with epigenetics. epigenetic subnetwork analysis identified a set of seven conserved genes across all stages: ubc, kras, pik3ca, pik3r <dig>  raf <dig>  braf, and rap1a. a detailed literature analysis elucidated epigenetic genes like foxg <dig>  hla-g, and nkx6- <dig> to be known as prognostic targets.


CONCLUSIONS
integrating epigenetic information for genes with expression data can be useful for comprehending in-depth disease mechanism and for the ultimate goal of better target identification.
