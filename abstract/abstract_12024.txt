BACKGROUND
while many placental herpesvirus genomes have been fully sequenced, the complete genome of a marsupial herpesvirus has not been described. here we present the first genome sequence of a metatherian herpesvirus, macropodid herpesvirus  <dig> .


RESULTS
the mahv- <dig> viral genome was sequenced using an illumina miseq sequencer, de novo assembly was performed and the genome was annotated. the mahv- <dig> genome was  <dig> kbp in length and clustered phylogenetically with the primate simplexviruses, sharing 67 % nucleotide sequence identity with human herpesviruses  <dig> and  <dig>  the mahv- <dig> genome contained  <dig> predicted open reading frames  homologous to those in other herpesvirus genomes, but lacked homologues of ul <dig>  ul <dig>  ul <dig> and glycoprotein j. this is the first alphaherpesvirus genome that has been found to lack the ul <dig> and ul <dig> homologues. we identified six novel orfs and confirmed their transcription by rt-pcr.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first genome sequence of a herpesvirus that infects metatherians, a taxonomically unique mammalian clade. members of the simplexvirus genus are remarkably conserved, so the absence of orfs otherwise retained in eutherian and avian alphaherpesviruses contributes to our understanding of the alphaherpesvirinae. further study of metatherian herpesvirus genetics and pathogenesis provides a unique approach to understanding herpesvirus-mammalian interactions.
