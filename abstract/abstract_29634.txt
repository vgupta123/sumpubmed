BACKGROUND
evidence demonstrates that exogenously administered nitric oxide  can induce insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. we have investigated the modulatory effects of two no donors, s-nitroso-n-acetyl-d, l-penicillamine  and s-nitrosoglutathione  on the early events in insulin signaling in rat skeletal myocytes.


RESULTS
skeletal muscle cells from 6– <dig> week old sprague-dawley rats were treated with snap or gsno  in the presence or absence of glucose  and insulin . cellular insulin receptor-β levels and tyrosine phosphorylation in irs- <dig> were significantly reduced, while serine phosphorylation in irs- <dig> was significantly increased in these cells, when compared to the insulin-stimulated control. reversal to near normal levels was achieved using the no scavenger, 2-- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide .


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that no is a potent modulator of insulin-mediated signal transduction and may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of type  <dig> diabetes mellitus.
