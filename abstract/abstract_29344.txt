BACKGROUND
the differentiation of human bone marrow derived skeletal stem cells  into osteoblasts involves the activation of a small number of well-described transcription factors. to identify additional osteoblastic transcription factors, we studied gene expression of hmscs during ex vivo osteoblast differentiation.


RESULTS
clustering of gene expression, and literature investigation, revealed three transcription factors of interest – znf <dig>  znf <dig> and zbtb <dig>  sirna knockdown of znf <dig> resulted in significant suppression of alkaline phosphatase  activity. this effect was not present for znf <dig> and zbtb <dig>  to identify possible target genes of znf <dig>  we analyzed gene expression following znf <dig> sirna knockdown. this revealed a 23-fold upregulation of matrix metallopeptidase  <dig> and an 18-fold upregulation of leucine-rich repeat containing g protein-coupled receptor  <dig> and ran-binding protein 3-like. we also observed enrichment in extracellular matrix organization, skeletal system development and regulation of ossification in the entire upregulated set of genes. consistent with its function as a transcription factor during osteoblast differentiation of hmsc, we showed that the znf <dig> protein exhibits nuclear localization and is expressed in osteoblastic and osteocytic cells in vivo. znf <dig> is conserved in tetrapod vertebrates and contains a krab  transcriptional repressor domain.


CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that the uncharacterized transcription factor, znf <dig>  is associated with differentiation of hmsc to osteoblasts.
