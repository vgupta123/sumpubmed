BACKGROUND
leptospira interrogans are bacterial pathogens of animal that cause zoonotic infections in human. outer membrane proteins of leptospire are among the most effective antigens which can stimulate remarkable immune responses during the infection processes, and thus are currently considered leading candidate vaccine antigens. the objective of the present study is to predict and confirm major combined b and t cell epitopes of leptospiral outer membrane proteins ompl <dig> and lipl <dig>  as well as to evaluate their capacity in the induction of immune responses in balb/c mice.


RESULTS
in this study, four epitopes from ompl <dig> and four from lipl <dig> conserved regions were evaluated for their potential utilization in leptospire vaccines. firstly, combined b and t cell epitopes were predicted by softwares and expressed using a phage display system. ompl <dig> residues 87- <dig> and 173- <dig>  and lipl4130- <dig>  lipl41233- <dig> of lipl <dig> were identified as immunodominant b cell epitopes by western blot. epitopes ompl1173- <dig>  ompl1297- <dig> of ompl <dig> and lipl41233- <dig>  lipl41263- <dig> of lipl <dig> were identified as immunodominant cd4+ t cell epitopes through proliferation analysis of splenocytes from recombinant ompl <dig>  or recombinant lipl <dig> -immunized balb/c  mice. these epitopes induced responses of cd4+ t cells and th <dig>  type cytokine responses during the infection.


CONCLUSIONS
this work identified combined t and b cell immunodominant epitopes in outer membrane proteins ompl <dig> and lipl <dig> of leptospira interrogans. ompl1173- <dig> of ompl <dig> and lipl41233- <dig> of lipl <dig> could be useful in a vaccine against leptospira. the findings could also contribute to the development of effective cross-protective vaccine strategies for leptospirosis.
