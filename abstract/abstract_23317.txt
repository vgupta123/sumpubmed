BACKGROUND
most recent studies of clostridium perfringens plasmids have focused on toxin-encoding or antibiotic resistance plasmids. to cause intestinal disease, a toxigenic strain must grow in the intestines to levels allowing for sufficient toxin production and this in vivo growth often involves overcoming the normal intestinal microbial population. for this purpose, bacteriocin production might be important.


RESULTS
in this study, as the first step in the genetic analysis of a co-existing plasmid with an enterotoxin gene -encoding plasmid, the bacteriocin gene-encoding plasmid, pbcnf <dig>  was completely sequenced. this plasmid has some homology with two previously sequenced c. perfringens plasmids, namely, pcp <dig> carrying a cpb <dig> gene and pip <dig> carrying a bcn gene. using recombinant plasmids, the rep gene homologous to the pcp <dig> gene on pcp <dig> appeared to be functional. comparative genomics indicated that the identified rep gene homologs were found on two additional toxin plasmids, pcp-os <dig> and pcp-ts <dig>  while functional analysis using recombinant plasmids indicated that pbcnf <dig> and pcp <dig> are likely to be incompatible, the plasmid replication and partitioning region of pbcnf <dig> alone was insufficient for stable maintenance of this plasmid.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that pbcnf <dig> evolved from recombination events between c. perfringens plasmids and inter-species mobile genetic element. in addition, the bcn-encoding plasmid, pbcnf <dig>  is likely to be included in the inc family, which includes pcp <dig> and two variant iota-encoding plasmids. furthermore, the bcn gene on pbcnf <dig> could contribute to gastrointestinal disease induced by enterotoxigenic c. perfringens.
