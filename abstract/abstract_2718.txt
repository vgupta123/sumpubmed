BACKGROUND
the mosquito aedes aegypti is the primary vector for medically important arthropod-borne viruses, including chikungunya virus . following oral acquisition, an arbovirus has to persistently infect several organs in the mosquito before becoming transmissible to another vertebrate host. a major obstacle an arbovirus has to overcome during its infection cycle inside the mosquito is the midgut escape barrier, representing the exit mechanism arboviruses utilize when disseminating from the midgut. to understand the transcriptomic basis of midgut escape and to reveal genes involved in the process, we conducted a comparative transcriptomic analysis of midgut samples from mosquitoes which had received a saline meal  or a protein meal   containing chikv.


RESULTS
chikv which was orally acquired by a mosquito along with a sm or pm productively infected the midgut epithelium and disseminated to secondary tissues. a total of  <dig> rna-seq libraries from midguts of mosquitoes that had received pm or sm  containing chikv at  <dig> and  <dig> days post-feeding were generated and sequenced. fewer than  <dig> genes responded differentially to the presence of chikv in midguts of mosquitoes that had acquired the virus along with sm or pm. sm feeding induced differential expression  of  <dig> genes at day  <dig> and  <dig> genes at day  <dig> when compared to midguts of sugarfed mosquitoes. by comparison, pm feeding induced  <dig> de genes at day  <dig> and  <dig> genes at day  <dig>  twenty-three de genes encoding trypsins, metalloproteinases, and serine-type endopeptidases were significantly upregulated in midguts of mosquitoes at day  <dig> following sm or pm ingestion. two of these genes were ae. aegypti late trypsin  and serine collagenase  <dig> precursor . in vitro, recombinant aelt showed strong matrix metalloproteinase activity whereas recombinant aesp <dig> did not.


CONCLUSIONS
by substituting a bloodmeal for sm, we identified midgut-expressed genes not involved in blood or protein digestion. these included genes coding for trypsins, metalloproteinases, and serine-type endopeptidases, which could be involved in facilitating midgut escape for arboviruses in ae. aegypti. the presence of chikv in any of the ingested meals had relatively minor effects on the overall gene expression profiles in midguts.
