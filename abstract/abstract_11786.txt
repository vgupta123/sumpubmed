BACKGROUND
for a good probiotic candidate, the abilities to adhere to intestinal epithelium and to fortify barrier function are considered to be crucial for colonization and functionality of the strain. the strain lactobacillus acidophilus lab <dig> was isolated from the jejunum of a healthy dog, where it was found to be the most pre-dominant lactobacilli. in this study, the adhesion ability of lab <dig> to intestinal epithelial cell  lines, iecs isolated from canine intestinal biopsies, and to canine, porcine and human intestinal mucus was investigated. further, we studied the ability of lab <dig> to fortify the epithelial cell monolayer and to reduce lps-induced interleukin  release from enterocytes.


RESULTS
we found that lab <dig> presented higher adhesion to canine colonic mucus as compared to mucus isolated from porcine colon. lab <dig> showed adhesion to ht- <dig> and caco- <dig> cell lines, and importantly also to canine iecs isolated from canine intestinal biopsies. in addition, lab <dig> increased the transepithelial electrical resistance  of enterocyte monolayers and thus strengthened the intestinal barrier function. the strain showed also anti-inflammatory capacity in being able to attenuate the lps-induced il- <dig> production of ht- <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, canine indigenous strain lab <dig> is a potential probiotic candidate for dogs adhering to the host epithelium and showing intestinal barrier fortifying and anti-inflammatory effects.
