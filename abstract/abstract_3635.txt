BACKGROUND
how does the brain convert sounds and phonemes into comprehensible speech? in the present magnetoencephalographic study we examined the hypothesis that the coherence of electromagnetic oscillatory activity within and across brain areas indicates neurophysiological processes linked to speech comprehension.


RESULTS
amplitude-modulated  auditory verbal and nonverbal stimuli served to drive steady-state oscillations in neural networks involved in speech comprehension. stimuli were presented to  <dig> subjects in the following conditions  an incomprehensible string of words,  the same string of words after being introduced as a comprehensible sentence by proper articulation, and  nonverbal stimulations that included a 600-hz tone, a scale, and a melody. coherence, defined as correlated activation of magnetic steady state fields across brain areas and measured as simultaneous activation of current dipoles in source space , increased within left- temporal-posterior areas when the sound string was perceived as a comprehensible sentence. intra-hemispheric coherence was larger within the left than the right hemisphere for the sentence  relative to all other conditions), and tended to be larger within the right than the left hemisphere for nonverbal stimuli , tone and melody relative to the other conditions), leading to a more pronounced hemispheric asymmetry for nonverbal than verbal material.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that coherent neuronal network activity may index encoding of verbal information on the sentence level and can be used as a tool to investigate auditory speech comprehension.
