BACKGROUND
previous data from our laboratory has indicated that a functional link exists between the g-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium  channel and the beta-adrenergic receptor pathway in breast cancer cell lines, and these pathways were involved in growth regulation of these cells. alcohol is an established risk factor for breast cancer and has been found to open girk. in order to further investigate girk channels in breast cancer and possible alteration by ethanol, we identified girk channel protein expression in breast cancer cells.


RESULTS
cell pellets were collected and membrane protein was isolated to determine girk protein expression. girk protein was also analyzed by immuno-precipitation. girk protein was over-expressed in cells by transfection of girk plasmids. gene expression studies were done by real-time rt-pcr. girk protein expression was identified in breast cancer cell lines. expression of girk <dig> at the indicated molecular weight   was seen in cell lines mda-mb- <dig> and zr-75- <dig>  in addition, girk <dig> expression was seen at a lower mw  in mda-mb- <dig>  mda-mb- <dig>  mcf- <dig>  zr-75- <dig>  and mda-mb- <dig> cell lines. to prove the lower mw protein was girk <dig>  mda-mb- <dig> cells were immuno-precipitated. girk <dig> expression was seen in mda-mb- <dig>  mcf- <dig>  and zr-75- <dig> and was variable in mda-mb- <dig>  while girk <dig> protein expression was seen in all six cell lines tested. this is the first report indicating girk protein expression in breast cancer cells. to determine functionality, mda-mb- <dig> cells were stimulated with ethanol. decreased girk <dig> protein expression levels were seen after treatment with  <dig> % ethanol in mda-mb- <dig> breast cancer cells. serum-free media decreased girk protein expression, possibly due to lack of estrogen in the media. transfection of girk <dig> or girk <dig> plasmids increased girk <dig> protein expression and decreased gene expression in mda-mb- <dig> breast cancer cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicates that functional girk channels exist in breast cancer cells that are involved in cellular signaling.
