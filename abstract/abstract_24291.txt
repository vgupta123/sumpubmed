BACKGROUND
bacteriologic culture remains one of the most important methods to diagnose bovine tuberculosis despite the lengthy incubation time, significant decontamination and media expense, and high biocontainment requirements. media selection is an important determination of culture sensitivity, and the planned discontinuation of the bactec 460 tb culture system has challenged veterinary diagnostic laboratories to evaluate alternatives. at the national veterinary services laboratories the bactec mgit  <dig> and  <dig> solid media formulations were compared with the bactec 460 tb system on  <dig>  veterinary diagnostic specimens submitted for mycobacterium bovis culture.


RESULTS
m. bovis was isolated from  <dig> % of the samples and atypical mycobacteria from  <dig> % of the samples. the bactec 12b media isolated significantly more m. bovis  than mgit  <dig> media . however, contamination rates were much higher for the mgit media, 17-24%, compared to 7% for bactec, suggesting that contamination was a major cause of mgit reduced sensitivity. time to signal positive was  <dig>  weeks  for the mgit, and  <dig>  weeks  for the bactec, both earlier than any solid media. mycobactosel lj failed to isolate m. bovis from primary culture. an in-house 7h <dig> media supplemented with calf sera, hemolyzed blood, malachite green and pyruvate recovered more m. bovis  with the least amount of contamination of any other solid media evaluated.


CONCLUSIONS
decontamination methods may have to be optimized and or mgit media may have to be altered to reduce contamination in veterinary samples. despite these issues, the mgit  <dig> system is still favored over the use of solid media due to decreased time to recovery and the potential for higher sensitivity.
