BACKGROUND
controlling enzyme activity by ligand binding to a regulatory domain of choice may have many applications e.g. as biosensors and as tools in regulating cellular functions. however, until now only a small number of ligand-binding domains have been successfully linked to enzyme activity. g protein-coupled receptors  are capable of recognizing an extraordinary structural variety of extracellular signals including inorganic and organic molecules. ligand binding to gpcr results in conformational changes involving the transmembrane helices. here, we assessed whether ligand-induced conformational changes within the gpcr helix bundle can be utilized to control the activity of an integrated enzyme.


RESULTS
as a proof of principle, we inserted the luciferase amino acid sequence into the third intracellular loop of the m <dig> muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. this fusion protein retained both receptor and enzyme function. receptor blockers slightly but significantly reduced enzyme activity. by successive deletion mutagenesis the enzyme activity was optimally coupled to ligand-induced conformational helix movements.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that in engineered gpcr-enzyme chimeras, intracellular enzyme activity can be directly controlled by a gpcr serving as the extracellular ligand-binding domain.
