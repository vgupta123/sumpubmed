BACKGROUND
psychological conditions affect pain responses in the human anterior cingulate cortex  according to brain imaging analysis. the rodent prefrontal cortex  including cingulate areas is also related to the affective dimension of pain. we previously reported pfc nociceptive responses inhibited by inputs from the amygdala, such as with dopamine  d <dig> receptor  blockers, to show decreased effect on amygdala projections. in this study, we examined whether direct projections from the ventral tegmental area  to the pfc affect nociceptive responses in the pfc.


RESULTS
high frequency stimulation  delivered to the vta produced long-lasting suppression  of nociceptive responses in the rat pfc including cingulate and prelimbic areas. nociceptive responses evoked by mechanical pressure stimulation  applied to the tails of urethane-anesthetized rats were recorded using extracellular unit recording methods in the pfc. hfs delivered to the vta, which has been reported to increase da concentrations in the pfc, significantly suppressed nociceptive responses. the lls of nociceptive responses persisted for about  <dig> minutes and recovered to the control level within  <dig> min after hfs. we also demonstrated local microinjection of a selective d <dig> agonist of da receptors to induce lls of mechanical nociceptive responses, while a d <dig> but not a d <dig> antagonist impaired the lls evoked by hfs. in contrast, da depletion by a 6-hydroxydopamine injection or a low concentration of da induced by a Îº-opiate receptor agonist injected into the vta had minimal effect on nociceptive responses in the pfc.


CONCLUSIONS
hfs delivered to vta inhibited nociceptive responses for a long period in pfc. da d2r activation mediated by local d <dig> agonist injection also induced lls of mechanical nociceptive responses. the mesocortical da system may modify pfc nociceptive responses via d <dig> activity.
