BACKGROUND
transcriptional changes that contribute to the organism’s longevity and prevent the age-dependent decline of biological functions are not well understood. here, we overexpressed pro-longevity gene encoding glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit  and analyzed age-dependent changes in transcriptome that associated with the longevity, stress resistance, locomotor activity, circadian rhythmicity, and fertility.


RESULTS
here we reproduced the life extension effect of neuronal overexpression of the gclc gene and investigated its influence on the age-depended dynamics of transcriptome and biological functions such as fecundity, spontaneous locomotor activity and circadian rhythmicity, as well as on the resistance to oxidative, proteotoxic and osmotic stresses. it was shown that gclc overexpression reduces locomotor activity in the young and middle ages compared to control flies. gclc overexpression slowed down the age-dependent decline of locomotor activity and circadian rhythmicity, and resistance to stress treatments. gclc level demonstrated associations with the expression of genes involved in a variety of cellular processes including jak-stat, mapk, foxo, notch, mtor, tgf-beta signaling pathways, translation, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, proteasomal degradation, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, apoptosis, regulation of circadian rhythms, differentiation of neurons, synaptic plasticity and transmission.


CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed that gclc overexpression induces transcriptional changes associated with the lifespan extension and uncovered pathways that may be associated with the age-dependent decline of biological functions.
