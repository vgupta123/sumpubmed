BACKGROUND
many plant pathogen secretory proteins are known to be elicitors or pathogenic factors,which play an important role in the host-pathogen interaction process. bioinformatics approaches make possible the large scale prediction and analysis of secretory proteins from the puccinia helianthi transcriptome. the internet-based software signalp v <dig> , targetp v <dig> , big-pi predictor, tmhmm v <dig>  and protcomp v <dig>  were utilized to predict the signal peptides and the signal peptide-dependent secreted proteins among the  <dig>  orfs of the p. helianthi transcriptome.


RESULTS
 <dig> orfs  were identified as putative secretory proteins containing signal peptides. the length of the majority of proteins ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids , while the signal peptides were from  <dig> to  <dig> aa long. signal peptidase i  cleavage sites were found in  <dig> of these putative secretory signal peptides.  <dig> proteins contained the lipoprotein signal peptide recognition site of signal peptidase ii . out of  <dig> secretory proteins,  <dig>  have functions related to signal recognition and transduction, metabolism, transport and catabolism. additionally,  <dig> putative secretory proteins were categorized into  <dig> functional groups based on gene ontology terms, including  <dig> groups in biological process, seven in cellular component, and six in molecular function. gene ontology analysis of the secretory proteins revealed an enrichment of hydrolase activity. pathway associations were established for  <dig>  secretory proteins. a number of cell wall degrading enzymes and three homologous proteins specific to phytophthora sojae effectors were also identified, which may be involved in the pathogenicity of the sunflower rust pathogen.


CONCLUSIONS
this investigation proposes a new approach for identifying elicitors and pathogenic factors. the eventual identification and characterization of  <dig> extracellularly secreted proteins will advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of interactions between sunflower and rust pathogen and will enhance our ability to intervene in disease states.
