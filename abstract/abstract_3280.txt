BACKGROUND
aggregation may play a main role in the adhesion of bacteria to the gastrointestinal epithelium and their colonization ability, as well as in probiotic effects through co-aggregation with intestinal pathogens and their subsequent removal. the aggregation phenomenon in lactococci is directly associated with the sex factor and lactose plasmid co-integration event or duplication of the cell wall spanning  domain of prtp proteinase.


RESULTS
lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis bgkp <dig> was isolated from artisanal semi-hard homemade cheese and selected due to its strong auto-aggregation phenotype. subsequently, non-aggregating derivative  of bgkp <dig>  designated as bgkp1- <dig>  was isolated, too. comparative analysis of cell surface proteins of bgkp <dig> and derivative bgkp1- <dig> revealed a protein of approximately  <dig> kda only in the parental strain bgkp <dig>  the gene involved in aggregation  was mapped on plasmid pkp <dig> , cloned and expressed in homologous and heterologous lactococci and enterococci. this novel lactococcal aggregation protein was shown to be sufficient for cell aggregation in all tested hosts. in addition to the aggl gene, six more orfs involved in replication , restriction and modification , transposition  and possible interaction with mucin  were also located on plasmid pkp <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
aggl is a new protein belonging to the collagen-binding superfamily of proteins and is sufficient for cell aggregation in lactococci.
