BACKGROUND
retinal ganglion cells  are preferentially lost in glaucoma or optic neuritis. in the present study, we investigated the protective effect of mircorna  <dig>  against oxidative stress induced apoptosis in rgc- <dig> cells.


RESULTS
rat rgc- <dig> cells were cultured in plates and h2o <dig> was added to induce oxidative stress. tunel assay and qrt-pcr showed h2o <dig> induced apoptosis and up-regulated mir- <dig> in a dose-dependent manner in rgc- <dig> cells. conversely, lentiviral-mediated mir- <dig> down-regulation protected h2o <dig> induced apoptosis, promoted neurite growth and activated akt/erk and trkb pathways through phosphorylation. luciferase assay confirmed that igf1r was directly regulated by mir- <dig> in rgc- <dig> cells, and sirna-mediated igf1r knockdown activated akt protein through phosphorylation, down-regulated mir- <dig>  therefore exerted a protective effect on rgc- <dig> apoptosis.


CONCLUSIONS
down-regulating mir- <dig> is an effective method to protect h2o <dig> induced apoptosis in rgc- <dig> cells, possible associated with igf1r regulation.
