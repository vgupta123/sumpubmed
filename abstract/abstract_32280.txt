BACKGROUND
we present a fast version of the dynamics perturbation analysis  algorithm to predict functional sites in protein structures. the original dpa algorithm finds regions in proteins where interactions cause a large change in the protein conformational distribution, as measured using the relative entropy dx. such regions are associated with functional sites.


RESULTS
the fast dpa algorithm, which accelerates dpa calculations, is motivated by an empirical observation that dx in a normal-modes model is highly correlated with an entropic term that only depends on the eigenvalues of the normal modes. the eigenvalues are accurately estimated using first-order perturbation theory, resulting in a n-fold reduction in the overall computational requirements of the algorithm, where n is the number of residues in the protein. the performance of the original and fast dpa algorithms was compared using protein structures from a standard small-molecule docking test set. for nominal implementations of each algorithm, top-ranked fast dpa predictions overlapped the true binding site 94% of the time, compared to 87% of the time for original dpa. in addition, per-protein recall statistics  were slightly better for fast dpa. on the other hand, per-protein precision statistics  were slightly better using original dpa. overall, the performance of fast dpa in predicting ligand-binding-site residues was comparable to that of the original dpa algorithm.


CONCLUSIONS
compared to the original dpa algorithm, the decreased run time with comparable performance makes fast dpa well-suited for implementation on a web server and for high-throughput analysis.
