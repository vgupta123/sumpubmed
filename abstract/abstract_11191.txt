BACKGROUND
in man, infection by the gram-negative enteropathogen yersinia pseudotuberculosis is usually limited to the terminal ileum. however, in immunocompromised patients, the microorganism may disseminate from the digestive tract and thus cause a systemic infection with septicemia.


RESULTS
to gain insight into the metabolic pathways and virulence factors expressed by the bacterium at the blood stage of pseudotuberculosis, we compared the overall gene transcription patterns  of bacterial cells cultured in either human plasma or luria-bertani medium. the most marked plasma-triggered metabolic consequence in y. pseudotuberculosis was the switch to high glucose consumption, which is reminiscent of the acetogenic pathway  in escherichia coli. however, upregulation of the glyoxylate shunt enzymes suggests that  acetate may be further metabolized in y. pseudotuberculosis. our data also indicate that the bloodstream environment can regulate major virulence genes ; the yada adhesin gene and most of the transcriptional units of the pyv-encoded type iii secretion apparatus were found to be upregulated, whereas transcription of the ph <dig> antigen locus was strongly repressed.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that plasma growth of y. pseudotuberculosis is responsible for major transcriptional regulatory events and prompts key metabolic reorientations within the bacterium, which may in turn have an impact on virulence.
