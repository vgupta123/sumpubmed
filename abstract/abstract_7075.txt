BACKGROUND
the piggybac transposable element is a popular tool for germ-line transgenesis of eukaryotes. despite this, little is known about the mechanism of transposition or the transposase  itself. a thorough understanding of just how piggybac works may lead to more effective use of this important mobile element. a psortii analysis of the tpase amino acid sequence predicts a bipartite nuclear localization signal  near the c-terminus, just upstream of a putative znf .


RESULTS
we fused the piggybac tpase upstream of and in-frame with the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein  in the drosophila melanogaster inducible metallothionein protein. using drosophila schneider  <dig>  cells and the deep red fluorescent nuclear stain draq <dig>  we were able to track the pattern of piggybac localization with a scanning confocal microscope  <dig> hours after induction with copper sulphate.


CONCLUSIONS
through n and c-terminal truncations, targeted internal deletions, and specific amino acid mutations of the piggybac tpase open reading frame, we found that not only is the psortii-predicted nls required for the tpase to enter the nucleus of s <dig> cells, but there are additional requirements for negatively charged amino acids a short length upstream of this region for nuclear localization.
