BACKGROUND
canine reticulated platelets  i.e., juvenile plts reflecting thrombopoiesis can be measured automatically with the hematology analyzer sysmex xt-2000iv using manual gating options. however, the impact of interferences on r-plt measurements performed with the gates published previously  is largely unknown.

the aim was to compare different published gates for measurement of r-plts with the sysmex xt-2000iv with an own, optimized gate  and to establish reference intervals  in >  <dig> dogs.

data of  <dig> measurements of diseased and healthy dogs were analyzed retrospectively. several gates were applied and ris for r-plts and platelet indices were established for pet dogs and a group of  <dig> healthy beagles kept under defined housing conditions. intra-assay precision  was also assessed.


RESULTS
in 30/ <dig> samples, interferences consistent with small erythrocytes/reticulocytes were seen in the previously published gates but not in the “oellers-gate”. good correlation was found between the different gates . ris for the “pankraz-gate”, the “gelain-gate”, and the “oellers-gate” were  <dig> – <dig> ,  <dig> – <dig>  and  <dig> – <dig>  % respectively. cvs were ranging between  <dig> and 41 %.


CONCLUSIONS
optimization of previously published gates minimized interferences of small erythrocytes with r-plt measurements.
