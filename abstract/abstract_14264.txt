BACKGROUND
surgical site infections  caused by biofilm-forming methicillin-resistant staphylococcus pseudintermedius  have emerged as the most common hospital-acquired infections in companion animals. no methods currently exist for the therapeutic remediation of ssis caused by mrsp in biofilms. clarithromycin  has been shown to prevent biofilm formation by staphylococcus aureus. this study aims to assess the in vitro activity of cla in eradicating mrsp biofilm formation on various materials.


RESULTS
quantitative assay results  suggest that cla does not eradicate mrsp biofilm formation on polystyrene after  <dig> â€“  <dig> h growth periods. scanning electron micrographs confirmed that cla did not eradicate mrsp biofilm formed on orthopaedic implants.


CONCLUSIONS
by determining the in vitro characteristics and activities of mrsp isolates alone and against antibiotics, in vitro models of biofilm related infections can be made. in vitro data suggests that cla does not effectively eradicate s. pseudintermedius biofilms in therapeutic doses.
