BACKGROUND
interleukin  <dig>  signals via the il- <dig> receptor  and drives homeostatic t-cell proliferation in patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation .

purpose
we performed a prospective study in adults  and children  undergoing ahsct measuring plasma il- <dig> and soluble il-7r  concentrations between  <dig> and 12 months after hsct in order to investigate the link between sil-7r and clinical events after ahsct.


RESULTS
sil-7r, but not il- <dig>  increased with time after hsct in plasma from all patients enrolled in the study. sil-7r values were higher at  <dig>   <dig>  and 6 months  if the donor was a sibling as compared to an unrelated donor. increased sil-7r levels were also identified in plasma from patients who were not treated with anti-thymocyte globulin . low sil-7r was associated with any grade of acute graft-versus-host disease  at  <dig> and 6 months  and with a positive cmv pcr at 2 months after hsct . patients with cytomegalovirus  reactivation had increased il- <dig> values at  <dig> and 3 months  after hsct. in multivariate analysis, lower sil-7r levels were associated with acute gvhd :  <dig> , p >  <dig> ) and sibling donors . recipients of sibling grafts showed high levels of il- <dig>  and bone marrow recipients had low il- <dig> levels .


CONCLUSIONS
measurement of the sil-7r/il- <dig> axis will help in guided immune monitoring after hsct and guided interference with sil-7r may be explored in gvhd management.
