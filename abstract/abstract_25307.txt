BACKGROUND
the g protein-coupled receptors  belong to the largest superfamily of integral cell membrane proteins and play crucial roles in physiological processes including behavior, development and reproduction. because of their broad and diverse roles in cellular signaling, gpcrs are the therapeutic targets for many prescription drugs. however, there is no commercial pesticide targeting insect gpcrs. in this study, we employed functional genomics methods and used the red flour beetle, tribolium castaneum, as a model system to study the physiological roles of gpcrs during the larval growth, molting and metamorphosis.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> non-sensory gpcrs were identified in the t. castaneum genome. thirty-nine of them were not reported previously. large-scale rna interference  screen was used to study the function of all these gpcrs during immature stages. double-stranded rna -mediated knockdown in the expression of genes coding for eight gpcrs caused severe developmental arrest and ecdysis failure . these gpcrs include dopamine- <dig> like receptor  and latrophilin receptor . the majority of larvae injected with tc007490/d2r dsrna died during larval stage prior to entering pupal stage, suggesting that this gpcr is essential for larval growth and development.


CONCLUSIONS
the results from our study revealed the physiological roles of some gpcrs in t. castaneum. these findings could help in development of novel pesticides targeting these gpcrs.
