BACKGROUND
dna copy number variations occur within populations and aberrations can cause disease. we sought to develop an improved lab-automatable, cost-efficient, accurate platform to profile dna copy number.


RESULTS
we developed a sequencing-based assay of nuclear, mitochondrial, and telomeric dna copy number that draws on the unbiased nature of next-generation sequencing and incorporates techniques developed for rna expression profiling. to demonstrate this platform, we assayed umc- <dig> cells using  <dig> million  <dig> nt reads and found tremendous copy number variation, including regions of single and homogeneous deletions and amplifications to  <dig> copies;  <dig> times more mitochondria and  <dig> times less telomeric sequence than a pool of non-diseased, blood-derived dna; and that umc- <dig> was derived from a male individual.


CONCLUSIONS
the described assay outputs absolute copy number, outputs an error estimate , and is more accurate than array-based platforms at high copy number. the platform enables profiling of mitochondrial levels and telomeric length. the assay is lab-automatable and has a genomic resolution and cost that are tunable based on the number of sequence reads.
