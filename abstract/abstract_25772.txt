BACKGROUND
the erbb <dig> gene is essential for the proper development of the neural crest  and its derivative populations such as schwann cells. as with all cell fate decisions, transcriptional regulatory control plays a significant role in the progressive restriction and specification of nc derived lineages during development. however, little is known about the sequences mediating transcriptional regulation of erbb <dig> or the factors that bind them.


RESULTS
in this study we identified three transcriptional enhancers at the erbb <dig> locus and evaluated their regulatory potential in vitro in nc-derived cell types and in vivo in transgenic zebrafish. one enhancer, termed erbb3_mcs <dig>  which lies within the first intron of erbb <dig>  directs the highest reporter expression in vitro and also demonstrates epigenetic marks consistent with enhancer activity. we identify a consensus sox <dig> binding site within erbb3_mcs <dig> and demonstrate, in vitro, its necessity and sufficiency for the activity of this enhancer. additionally, we demonstrate that transcription from the endogenous erbb <dig> locus is dependent on sox <dig>  further we demonstrate in vitro that sox <dig> physically interacts with that erbb3_mcs <dig>  consistent with its in vitro activity, we also show that erbb3_mcs <dig> drives reporter expression in nc cells and a subset of its derivative lineages in vivo in zebrafish in a manner consistent with erbb3b expression. we also demonstrate, using morpholino analysis, that sox <dig> is necessary for erbb3_mcs <dig> expression in vivo in zebrafish.


CONCLUSIONS
taken collectively, our data suggest that erbb <dig> may be directly regulated by sox <dig>  and that this control may in part be facilitated by erbb3_mcs <dig>
