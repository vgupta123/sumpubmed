BACKGROUND
induced pluripotent stem cells  derived from somatic cells have enormous potential for clinical applications. notably, it was recently reported that reprogramming from somatic cells to ipscs can induce genomic copy number variation , which is one of the major genetic causes of human diseases. however it was unclear if this genome instability is dependent on reprogramming methods and/or the genetic background of donor cells. furthermore, genome-wide cnv analysis is technically challenging and cnv data need to be interpreted with care.


RESULTS
in order to carefully investigate the possible cnv instability during somatic reprogramming, we performed genome-wide cnv analyses with  <dig> mouse ipsc lines generated from the same parental donor; therefore, the donorâ€™s genetic background can be controlled. different reprogramming factor combinations and dosages were used for investigating potential method-dependent effects on genome integrity. we detected  <dig> ipsc cnvs using high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization. intriguingly, cnv rates were negatively associated with the dosages of classic factor. furthermore, the use of high-performance engineered factors led to less cnvs than the classic factor of the same dosage.


CONCLUSIONS
our observations suggest that sufficient reprogramming force can protect the genome from cnv instability during the reprogramming process.
