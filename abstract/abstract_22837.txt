BACKGROUND
the fgf <dig> gene is expressed in the brain neuroepithelium during embryonic development and in astroglial cells throughout life. previous knockout studies suggested that fgf <dig> plays a role in the proliferation of neural progenitors in the embryonic cerebral cortex. these studies exclusively used knockout alleles lacking the fgf <dig> exon  <dig>  however, the description of putative alternative exons located downstream from the canonical exon  <dig> raised the possibility that alternatively spliced transcripts may compensate for the lack of the canonical exon  <dig> in the fgf <dig> -/- mice.


RESULTS
we generated and characterized a new line of fgf <dig> knockout mice lacking the expression of exon  <dig>  which is conserved in all fgf <dig> transcripts and contains essential heparin and receptor binding interfaces. the expression of fgf <dig> exon  <dig> was prevented by inserting a transcriptional stop cassette in the fgf <dig> genomic locus. these mice demonstrate a phenotype in the adult neocortex characterized by decreased density and number of cortical excitatory neurons and astrocytes, which is virtually identical to that of the fgf <dig> -/- mice lacking exon  <dig>  in addition, we also show that the fgf <dig> exon  <dig> knockout mice have decreased proliferation of precursors in the adult cerebral cortex, which had not been previously investigated in the other mutant lines.


CONCLUSIONS
the results demonstrate that the phenotype of two completely different fgf <dig> ko mouse lines, lacking exon  <dig> or exon  <dig>  is remarkably similar. the combined results from these ko models clearly indicate that fgf <dig> plays a role in cortical cell genesis during embryonic development as well as in adulthood. thus, fgf <dig> may be required for the maintenance of the pool of adult cortical progenitor cells.
