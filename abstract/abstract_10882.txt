BACKGROUND
document classification is a wide-spread problem with many applications, from organizing search engine snippets to spam filtering. we previously described textpresso, a text-mining system for biological literature, which marks up full text according to a shallow ontology that includes terms of biological interest. this project investigates document classification in the context of biological literature, making use of the textpresso markup of a corpus of caenorhabditis elegans literature.


RESULTS
we present a two-step text categorization algorithm to classify a corpus of c. elegans papers. our classification method first uses a support vector machine-trained classifier, followed by a novel, phrase-based clustering algorithm. this clustering step autonomously creates cluster labels that are descriptive and understandable by humans. this clustering engine performed better on a standard test-set  compared to previously published results , while producing cluster descriptions that appear more useful. a web interface allows researchers to quickly navigate through the hierarchy and look for documents that belong to a specific concept.


CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated a simple method to classify biological documents that embodies an improvement over current methods. while the classification results are currently optimized for caenorhabditis elegans papers by human-created rules, the classification engine can be adapted to different types of documents. we have demonstrated this by presenting a web interface that allows researchers to quickly navigate through the hierarchy and look for documents that belong to a specific concept.
