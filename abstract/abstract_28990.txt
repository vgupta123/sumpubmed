BACKGROUND
aquatic vascular plants are a distinctive group, differing from terrestrial plants in their growth forms and habitats. among the various aquatic plant life forms, the evolutionary processes of freshwater submerged species are most likely distinct due to their exclusive occurrence in the discrete and patchy aquatic habitats. using the chloroplast trnl-f region sequence data, we investigated the phylogeographic structure of a submerged macrophyte, hydrilla verticillata, the single species in the genus hydrilla, throughout china, in addition to combined sample data from other countries to reveal the colonisation and diversification processes of this species throughout the world.


RESULTS
we sequenced  <dig> individuals from  <dig> sampling locations throughout china and identified a significant phylogeographic structure , in which four distinct lineages occurred in different areas. a high level of genetic differentiation among populations  was detected. the divergence of hydrilla was estimated to have occurred in the late miocene, and the diversification of various clades was dated to the pleistocene epoch. biogeographic analyses suggested an east asian origin of hydrilla and its subsequent dispersal throughout the world.


CONCLUSIONS
the presence of all four clades in china indicates that china is most likely the centre of hydrilla genetic diversity. the worldwide distribution of hydrilla is due to recent vicariance and dispersal events that occurred in different clades during the pleistocene. our findings also provide useful information for the management of invasive hydrilla in north america.
