BACKGROUND
dried blood  spots provide an efficient way to collect and store blood specimens. dna from this source has been utilised for a number of molecular analyses including genome-wide association studies, but only few studies have tested the feasibility of using it for epigenetic applications, particularly at a genome-wide level.


RESULTS
in this study, we demonstrate the successful use of dna isolated from archived dried blood spots for the infinium humanmethylation <dig> beadchip, along with dna from matched frozen buffy coats. we obtained high quality and reproducible genome-wide dna methylation profiles using both sample types. we also report high correlations  between dna obtained from matched dried blood spots and frozen buffy coats, sufficient to distinguish between unrelated individuals.


CONCLUSIONS
we, thus, demonstrate that dna from archived dried blood spots is suitable for genome-wide dna methylation profiling.
