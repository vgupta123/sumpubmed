BACKGROUND
bordetella pertussis causes whooping cough or pertussis in humans. it produces several virulence factors, of which the fimbriae are considered adhesins and elicit immune responses in the host. b. pertussis has three distinct serotypes fim <dig>  fim <dig> or fim <dig> . generally, b. pertussis fim <dig> strains predominate in unvaccinated populations, whereas fim <dig> strains are often isolated in vaccinated populations. in finland, pertussis vaccination was introduced in  <dig>  the whole-cell vaccine contained two strains,  <dig>  since  <dig> and strain  <dig>  added in  <dig>  after that the vaccine has remained the same until  <dig> when the whole-cell vaccine was replaced by the acellular vaccine containing pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin. our aims were to study serotypes of finnish b. pertussis isolates from  <dig> to  <dig> in a population with > 90% vaccination coverage and fimbrial expression of the isolates during infection. serotyping was done by agglutination and serotype-specific antibody responses were determined by blocking elisa.


RESULTS
altogether,  <dig>  isolates were serotyped. before  <dig>  serotype distributions of fim <dig>  fim <dig> and fim <dig>  were 67%, 19% and 10%, respectively. from  <dig> to  <dig>  94% of the isolates were fim <dig> serotype. since  <dig>  the frequency of fim <dig> strains started to increase and reached 83% during a nationwide epidemic in  <dig>  a significant increase in level of serum igg antibodies against purified fimbriae was observed between paired sera of  <dig> patients. the patients infected by fim <dig> strains had antibodies which blocked the binding of monoclonal antibodies to fim <dig> but not to fim <dig>  moreover, about one third of the fim <dig> strain infected patients developed antibodies capable of blocking of binding of both anti-fim <dig> and fim <dig> monoclonal antibodies.


CONCLUSIONS
despite extensive vaccinations in finland, b. pertussis fim <dig> strains were the most common serotype. emergence of fim <dig> strains started in  <dig> and coincided with nationwide epidemics. results of serotype-specific antibody responses suggest that fim <dig> strains could express fim <dig> during infection, showing a difference in fimbrial expression between in vivo and in vitro.
