BACKGROUND
human papillomavirus, hpv, is the main etiological factor for cervical cancer. different studies show that in women infected with hpv there is a positive correlation between lesion grade and number of infiltrating macrophages, as well as with il- <dig> higher expression. using a hpv <dig> associated tumor model in mice, tc- <dig>  our laboratory has demonstrated that tumor infiltrating macrophages are m2-like, induce t cell regulatory phenotype and play an important role in tumor growth. m <dig> macrophages secrete several cytokines, among them il- <dig>  which has been shown to play a role in t cell suppression by tumor macrophages in other tumor models. in this work, we sought to establish if il- <dig> is part of the mechanism by which hpv tumor associated macrophages induce t cell regulatory phenotype, inhibiting anti-tumor activity and facilitating tumor growth.


RESULTS
tc- <dig> tumor cells do not express or respond to il- <dig>  but recruit leukocytes which, within the tumor environment, produce this cytokine. using il- <dig> deficient mice or blocking il- <dig> signaling with neutralizing antibodies, we observed a significant reduction in tumor growth, an increase in tumor infiltration by hpv <dig> e <dig> specific cd <dig> lymphocytes, including a population positive for granzyme b and perforin expression, and a decrease in the percentage of hpv specific regulatory t cells in the lymph nodes.


CONCLUSIONS
our data shows that in the hpv <dig> tc- <dig> tumor mouse model, il- <dig> produced by tumor macrophages induce regulatory phenotype on t cells, an immune escape mechanism that facilitates tumor growth. our results point to a possible mechanism behind the epidemiologic data that correlates higher il- <dig> expression with risk of cervical cancer development in hpv infected women.
