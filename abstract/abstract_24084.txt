BACKGROUND
arcobacter spp.  are ubiquitous zoonotic bacteria that are being increasingly recognised as a threat to human health. a previously published 16s rrna-rflp arcobacter spp. identification method produced specific rflp patterns for the six species described at that time, using a single endonuclease . the number of characterised arcobacter species has since risen to  <dig>  the aim of the present study was to update the 16s rrna-rflp identification method to include all currently characterised species of arcobacter.


RESULTS
digestion of the 16s rrna gene with the endonuclease msei produced clear, distinctive patterns for  <dig> of the  <dig> species, while the remaining species shared a common or very similar rflp pattern. subsequent digestion of the 16s rrna gene from these species with the endonucleases mnli and/or bfai generated species-specific rflp patterns.


CONCLUSIONS
16s rrna-rflp analysis identified  <dig> arcobacter spp. using either polyacrylamide or agarose gel electrophoresis. microheterogeneities within the 16s rrna gene, which interfered with the rflp identification, were also documented for the first time in this genus, particularly in strains of arcobacter cryaerophilus isolated from animal faeces and aborted foetuses.
