BACKGROUND
campylobacter jejuni strain  <dig> was demonstrated to have a broad specificity for eukaryotic surface glycosylation using glycan array analysis. the initial screen indicated that sialic acid and mannose are important binding partners after environmental stress, while galactose and fucose structures are likely to be involved in persistent infection.


RESULTS
in this broader study, five additional human/clinical isolates and six chicken isolates were fully assessed to determine their glycan binding capacity using an extended glycan array. c. jejuni  <dig> was rescreened here due to the presence of glycoaminoglycan  and other structures that were not available on our previous glycan array. the current array analysis of additional c. jejuni strains confirmed the growth condition dependent differences in glycan binding that was previously observed for c. jejuni  <dig>  we noted strain to strain variations, particularly for the human isolates c. jejuni  <dig> and  <dig> and the chicken isolate c. jejuni  <dig>  with the majority of differences observed in galactose, mannose and gag binding. chicken isolates were found to bind to a broader range of glycans compared to the human isolates, recognising branched mannose and carageenan  glycans. glycan array data was confirmed using cell-based lectin inhibition assays with the fucose  and mannose  binding lectins.


CONCLUSIONS
this study confirms that all c. jejuni strains tested bind to a broad range of glycans, with the majority of strains  altering recognition of sialic acid and mannose after environmental stress. galactose and fucose structures were bound best by all strains when c. jejuni was grown under host like conditions confirming the likelihood of these structures being involved in persistent infection.
