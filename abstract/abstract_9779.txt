BACKGROUND
bacteria use transcriptional regulation to respond to environmental stresses. specifically, exposure to antibacterial drugs is deemed to be an atypical stress, and altering transcriptional regulation in response to such stress can increase bacterial drug resistance. however, only a few transcription factors that regulate drug resistance have been reported.


RESULTS
in the present study, a gntr family transcription factor, encoded by the msmeg_ <dig>  gene, was shown to be an isoniazid  resistance regulator in mycobacterium smegmatis. when the ms <dig> gene was overexpressed, cells showed a significant increase in inh resistance. first, the interaction between ms <dig> and its own promoter was determined, and a conserved 26-bp palindromic dna binding motif was identified using electrophoretic mobility shift and dnasei footprinting assays. second, quantitative reverse transcription-pcr assays showed that ms <dig> acted as a transcriptional activator, and positively regulated its own expression, as well as that of a permease encoded by the msmeg_ <dig>  gene. similar to the case for the ms <dig> gene, a recombinant ms0534-overexpressing strain also exhibited increased inh resistance compared with the wild-type strain. furthermore, we showed that ms <dig> and ms <dig> deletion strains were more sensitive to inh than the wild-type strain. interestingly, overexpressing ms <dig> in the ms <dig> deletion strain enhanced its inh resistance. in contrast, the ms <dig> deletion strain was still sensitive to inh even when ms <dig> was overexpressed. these findings suggest that ms <dig> is an effector protein that affects inh resistance in m. smegmatis.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the gntr transcriptional regulator ms <dig> positively regulates inh resistance by transcriptionally regulating the expression of the ms <dig> permease in m. smegmatis. these results improve our understanding of the role of transcriptional regulation in inh drug resistance in mycobacteria.
