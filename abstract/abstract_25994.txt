BACKGROUND
efficient conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to fermentable sugars requires the synergistic action of multiple enzymes; consequently enzyme mixtures must be properly formulated for effective hydrolysis. the nature of an optimal enzyme blends depends on the type of pretreatment employed as well the characteristics of the substrate. in this study, statistical experimental design was used to develop mixtures of recombinant glycosyl hydrolases from thermophilic and anaerobic fungi that enhanced the digestion of alkaline peroxide treated alfalfa hay and barley straw by mixed rumen enzymes as well as commercial cellulases .


RESULTS
combinations of feruloyl and acetyl xylan esterases , endoglucanase gh <dig>  and polygalacturonase  with rumen enzymes improved straw digestion. inclusion of pectinase , endoxylanase , feruloyl esterase  and β-glucosidase  with a <dig> or endoglucanase gh <dig>  and β-xylosidase  with axc increased glucose release from alfalfa hay. glucose yield from straw was improved when fae1a and endoglucanase gh <dig>  were added to a <dig>  while fae1a and axe16a_aspng enhanced the activity of axc on straw. xylose release from alfalfa hay was augmented by supplementing a <dig> with e-bgluc, or axc with egl7a_thite and xyn11a_thite. adding arabinofuranosidase  and esterases  to a <dig>  or fae1a and axe16a_aspng to axc enhanced xylose release from barley straw, a response confirmed in a scaled up assay.


CONCLUSIONS
the efficacy of commercial enzyme mixtures as well as mixed enzymes from the rumen was improved through formulation with synergetic recombinant enzymes. this approach reliably identified supplemental enzymes that enhanced sugar release from alkaline pretreated alfalfa hay and barley straw.
