BACKGROUND
to discover a compound inhibiting multiple proteins  is a new paradigm for the complex diseases . in general, the polypharmacological proteins often share similar local binding environments and motifs. as the exponential growth of the number of protein structures, to find the similar structural binding motifs  is an emergency task for drug discovery  and protein functions.


RESULTS
we have developed a space-related pharmamotifs  method to recognize the binding motifs by searching against protein structure database. srpmotif is able to recognize conserved binding environments containing spatially discontinuous pharma-motifs which are often short conserved peptides with specific physico-chemical properties for protein functions. among  <dig> pharma-motifs,  <dig> % interacting residues are highly conserved. experimental results indicate that  <dig> % and  <dig> % polypharmacological targets of each protein-ligand complex are annotated with same biological process  and molecular function  terms, respectively, based on gene ontology . our experimental results show that the identified pharma-motifs often consist of key residues in functional  sites and play the key roles for protein functions. the srpmotif is available at http://gemdock.life.nctu.edu.tw/srp/.


CONCLUSIONS
srpmotif is able to identify similar pharma-interfaces and pharma-motifs sharing similar binding environments for polypharmacological targets by rapidly searching against the protein structure database. pharma-motifs describe the conservations of binding environments for drug discovery and protein functions. additionally, these pharma-motifs provide the clues for discovering new sequence-based motifs to predict protein functions from protein sequence databases. we believe that srpmotif is useful for elucidating protein functions and drug discovery.
