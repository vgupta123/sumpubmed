BACKGROUND
although the effect of salicylic acid  on photosynthesis of plants including grapevines has been investigated, very little is yet known about the effects of sa on carbon assimilation and several components of psii electron transport . in this study, the impact of sa pretreatment on photosynthesis was evaluated in the leaves of young grapevines before heat stress , during heat stress , and through the following recovery period . photosynthetic measures included gas exchange parameters, psii electron transport, energy dissipation, and rubisco activation state. the levels of heat shock proteins  in the chloroplast were also investigated.


RESULTS
sa did not significantly  influence the net photosynthesis rate  of leaves before heat stress. but, sa did alleviate declines in pn and rubisco activition state, and did not alter negative changes in psii parameters  under heat stress. following heat treatment, the recovery of pn in sa-treated leaves was accelerated compared with the control  leaves, and, donor and acceptor parameters of psii in sa-treated leaves recovered to normal levels more rapidly than in the controls. rubisco, however, was not significantly  influenced by sa. before heat stress, sa did not affect level of hsp  <dig>  but the hsp <dig> immune signal increased in both sa-treated and control leaves during heat stress. during the recovery period, hsp <dig> levels remained high through the end of the experiment in the sa-treated leaves, but decreased in controls.


CONCLUSIONS
sa pretreatment alleviated the heat stress induced decrease in pn mainly through maintaining higher rubisco activition state, and it accelerated the recovery of pn mainly through effects on psii function. these effects of sa may be related in part to enhanced levels of hsp <dig>
