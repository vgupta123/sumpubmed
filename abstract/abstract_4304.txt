BACKGROUND
extracellular leucine-rich repeat  proteins are a highly diverse superfamily of membrane-associated or secreted proteins. in the membrane-associated elrr proteins, the leucine-rich repeat motifs interact with the extracellular matrix and other ligands. characterizing their functions in animal model systems is key to deciphering their activities in various developmental processes.


RESULTS
in this study, we identify pan- <dig> as a critical regulator of c. elegans larval development. pan- <dig> encodes both transmembrane and cytoplasmic isoforms that vary in the presence and number of leucine-rich repeats. rnai experiments reveal that pan- <dig> is required for developmental processes that occur during the mid to late larval stages. specifically, pan- <dig> loss of function causes a late larval arrest with a failure to complete development of the gonad, vulva, and hypodermis. pan- <dig> is also required for early larval ecdysis and execution of the molting cycle at the adult molt. we also provide evidence that pan- <dig> functionally interacts with the heterochronic gene lin- <dig> during the molting process.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that pan- <dig> is a critical regulator of larval development. our data suggests that pan- <dig> promotes developmental progression of multiple tissues during the transition from a larva to a reproductive adult. we further demonstrate that the activity of pan- <dig> is complex with diverse roles in the regulation of animal development.
