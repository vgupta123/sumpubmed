BACKGROUND
for accuracy of quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction , normalisation with suitable reference genes is required. to date, no reference genes have been validated for expression studies of bronchoalveolar  cells. the aims of this study were to identify gene with stable mrna expression in bal cells irrespective of gender, smoking, bal cellular composition, lung pathology, treatment; and to assess the influence of reference genes on target gene expression data.


RESULTS
the mrna expression of ten housekeeping genes  was investigated by qrt-pcr in bal cells from  <dig> subjects across a spectrum of lung diseases. the analyses were validated in an independent bal cohort from  <dig> sarcoidosis patients and  <dig> control subjects. a second derivative method was used to calculate expression values ; an equivalence test, applets bestkeeper, genorm and normfinder were applied to investigate gene expression stability. of the investigated genes, psmb <dig>  and rpl <dig>  were the most stable; both were constantly expressed in bal samples from parallel investigated cohorts irrespective of evaluated variables. finally, to demonstrate effect of traditional  and novel  reference genes as denominators, expression of two cytokines known associated with sarcoidosis was investigated in sarcoid bal cells. while normalization with psmb2/rpl <dig> resulted in elevated ifng mrna expression ; no change was observed using gapdh/actb . ccl <dig> mrna up-regulation was observed only when psmb2/rpl <dig> were used as denominators .


CONCLUSIONS
psmb <dig> and rpl <dig> are, therefore, suitable reference genes to normalize qrt-pcr in bal cells in sarcoidosis, and other interstitial lung disease.
