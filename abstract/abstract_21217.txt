BACKGROUND
drosophila albomicans is a unique model organism for studying both sex chromosome and b chromosome evolution. a pair of its autosomes comprising roughly 40% of the whole genome has fused to the ancient x and y chromosomes only about  <dig>  million years ago, thereby creating the youngest and most gene-rich neo-sex system reported to date. this species also possesses recently derived b chromosomes that show non-mendelian inheritance and significantly influence fertility.

methods
we sequenced male flies with b chromosomes at  <dig> -fold genome coverage using next-generation sequencing. to characterize neo-y specific changes and b chromosome sequences, we also sequenced inbred female flies derived from the same strain but without b's at  <dig> -fold.


RESULTS
we assembled a female genome and placed 53% of the sequence and 85% of the annotated proteins into specific chromosomes, by comparison with the  <dig> drosophila genomes. despite its very recent origin, the non-recombining neo-y chromosome shows various signs of degeneration, including a significant enrichment of non-functional genes compared to the neo-x, and an excess of tandem duplications relative to other chromosomes. we also characterized a b-chromosome linked scaffold that contains an actively transcribed unit and shows sequence similarity to the subcentromeric regions of both the ancient x and the neo-x chromosome.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide novel insights into the very early stages of sex chromosome evolution and b chromosome origination, and suggest an unprecedented connection between the births of these two systems in d. albomicans.
