BACKGROUND
as studies of molecular biology system attempt to achieve a comprehensive understanding of a particular system, type  <dig> errors may be a significant problem. however, few investigators are inclined to accept the increase in type  <dig> errors  that may result when less stringent statistical cut-off values are used. to address this dilemma, we developed an analysis strategy that used a stringent statistical analysis to create a list of differentially expressed genes that served as "bait" to "fish out" other genes with similar patterns of expression.


RESULTS
comparing two strains of mice , we identified  <dig> genes with statistically significant differences in their patterns of expression. hierarchical clustering identified an additional  <dig> genes with similar patterns of expression differences between the two strains. pathway analysis was then employed: 1) identify the central genes and define biological processes that may be regulated by the genes identified, and 2) identify genes on the lists that could not be connected to each other in pathways . for networks created by both gene lists, the most connected  genes were interferon gamma  and tumor necrosis factor alpha . these two cytokines are relevant to the biological differences between the two strains of mice. furthermore, the network created by the list of  <dig> genes also suggested other biological differences between the strains.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these data demonstrate how stringent statistical analysis, combined with hierarchical clustering and pathway analysis may offer deeper insight into the biological processes reflected from a set of expression array data. this approach allows us to 'recapture" false negative genes that otherwise would have been missed by the statistical analysis.
