BACKGROUND
glucocorticoids such as prednisolone and dexamethasone are critical drugs used in multi-agent chemotherapy protocols used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia , and response to glucocorticoids is highly predictive of outcome. the nod/scid xenograft mouse model of all is a clinically relevant model in which the mice develop a systemic leukemia which retains the fundamental biological characteristics of the original disease. here we report a study evaluating the nod/scid xenograft mouse model to investigate glucocorticoid-induced gene expression. cells from a glucocorticoid-sensitive xenograft derived from a child with b-cell precursor all were inoculated into nod/scid mice. when highly engrafted the mice were randomized into groups of  <dig> to receive dexamethasone  <dig> mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection or vehicle control. leukemia cells were harvested from mice spleens at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> hours thereafter, and gene expression analyzed on illumina wg-6_v <dig> chips, comparing all groups to time  <dig> hours.


RESULTS
the  <dig> hour dexamethasone-treated timepoint had the highest number of significantly differentially expressed genes, with fewer observed at the  <dig> and  <dig> hour timepoints, and with minimal changes seen across the time-matched controls. when compared to publicly available datasets of glucocorticoid-induced gene expression from an in vitro cell line study and from an in vivo study of patients with all, at the level of pathways, expression changes in the  <dig> hour xenograft samples showed a similar response to patients treated with glucocorticoids. replicate analysis revealed that at the  <dig> hour timepoint, a dataset with high signal and differential expression, using data from  <dig> replicates instead of  <dig> resulted in excellent recovery scores of >  <dig> . however at other timepoints with less signal very poor recovery scores were obtained with  <dig> replicates.


CONCLUSIONS
the nod/scid xenograft mouse model provides a reproducible experimental system in which to investigate clinically-relevant mechanisms of drug-induced gene regulation in all; the  <dig> hour timepoint provides the highest number of significantly differentially expressed genes; time-matched controls are redundant and excellent recovery scores can be obtained with  <dig> replicates.
