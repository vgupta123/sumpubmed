BACKGROUND
neuroblastic tumors  derive from neural crest stem cells . histologically, nbt are composed by neuroblasts and schwannian cells. in culture, neuroblastic , substrate-adherent  and intermediate phenotype  cell subtypes arise spontaneously.

methods
here, neuroblastoma  cell line subtypes were characterized according to embryonic peripheral nervous system development markers , morphological features, gene expression and differentiation potential. i-type cells were investigated as a bipotential  differentiation stage.


RESULTS
positive immunostaining of ncsc  and undifferentiated cell  markers was observed in all nb subtypes. n- and i-type cells displayed cytoplasmic membrane gd <dig> staining, while nuclear calcyclin was restricted to s-type. n- and i-type cells showed similar phenotype and immunoreactivity pattern. differential gene expression was associated with each cell subtype. n- and i-type cells displayed similar differentiation capacity towards neuronal and glial lineage fates. s-type cells, upon induction, did not show a neuronal-like phenotype, despite gene expression changes.


CONCLUSIONS
results suggest that n- and i-type nb cell subtypes represent an immature bilineage stage, able to progress towards neuronal and glial fates upon induction of differentiation. s-type cells appear irreversibly committed to a glial lineage fate.
