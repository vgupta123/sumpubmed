BACKGROUND
shrimp culture is a fast growing aquaculture sector, but in recent years there has been a shift away from tiger shrimp penaeus monodon to other species. this is largely due to the susceptibility of p. monodon to white spot syndrome virus disease  which has impacted production around the world. as female penaeid shrimp grow more rapidly than males, mono-sex production would be advantageous, however little is known about genes controlling or markers associated with sex determination in shrimp. in this study, a mapped set of  <dig> transcribed single nucleotide polymorphisms were used to scan the p. monodon genome for loci associated with resistance to white-spot syndrome virus and sex in seven full-sibling tiger shrimp families challenged with white spot syndrome virus.


RESULTS
linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were found to contain quantitative trait loci significantly associated with hours of survival after white spot syndrome virus infection . nine qtl were significantly associated with hours of survival. of the snps mapping to these and other regions with suggestive associations, many were found to occur in transcripts showing homology to genes with putative immune functions of interest, including genes affecting the action of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, lymphocyte-cell function, heat shock proteins, the toll pathway, protein kinase signal transduction pathways, mrna binding proteins, lectins and genes affecting the development and differentiation of the immune system . several snps significantly associated with sex were mapped to linkage group  <dig>  the strongest associations  for  <dig> snps located in a  <dig>  cm stretch between positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm where the feminisation gene  mapped.


CONCLUSIONS
the markers for disease resistance and sexual differentiation identified by this study could be useful for marker assisted selection to improve resistance to wssv and for identifying homogametic female individuals for mono-sex  production. the genes with putative functions affecting immunity and sexual differentiation that were found to closely map to these loci provide leads about the mechanisms affecting these important economic traits in shrimp.
