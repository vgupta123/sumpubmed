BACKGROUND
eav-hp is an ancient retrovirus pre-dating gallus speciation, which continues to circulate in modern chicken populations, and led to the emergence of avian leukosis virus subgroup j causing significant economic losses to the poultry industry. we mapped eav-hp integration sites in ethiopian village chickens, a silkie, taiwan country chicken, red junglefowl gallus gallus and several inbred experimental lines using whole-genome sequence data.


RESULTS
an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  integration sites per bird were identified, which collectively group into  <dig> intervals of which 5 % are common to 90 % of the genomes analysed and are suggestive of pre-domestication integration events. more than a third of intervals are specific to individual genomes, supporting active circulation of eav-hp in modern chickens. interval density is correlated with chromosome length , and 27 % of intervals are located within 5 kb of a transcript. functional annotation clustering of genes reveals enrichment for immune-related functions .


CONCLUSIONS
our results illustrate a non-random distribution of eav-hp in the genome, emphasising the importance it may have played in the adaptation of the species, and provide a platform from which to extend investigations on the co-evolutionary significance of endogenous retroviral genera with their hosts.
