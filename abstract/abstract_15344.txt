BACKGROUND
roche  <dig> sequencing is the leading sequencing technology for producing long read high throughput sequence data. unlike most methods where sequencing errors translate to base uncertainties,  <dig> sequencing inaccuracies create nucleotide gaps. these gaps are particularly troublesome for translated search tools such as blastx where they introduce frame-shifts and result in regions of decreased identity and/or terminated alignments, which affect further analysis.


RESULTS
to address this issue, the homopolymer aware cross alignment tool  was developed. haxat uses a novel dynamic programming algorithm for solving the optimal local alignment between a  <dig> nucleotide and a protein sequence by allowing frame-shifts, guided by  <dig> flowpeak values. the algorithm is an efficient minimal extension of the smith-waterman-gotoh algorithm that easily fits in into other tools. experiments using haxat demonstrate, through the introduction of  <dig> specific frame-shift penalties, significantly increased accuracy of alignments spanning homopolymer sequence errors. the full effect of the new parameters introduced with this novel alignment model is explored. experimental results evaluating homopolymer inaccuracy through alignments show a two to five-fold increase in matthews correlation coefficient over previous algorithms, for 454-derived data.


CONCLUSIONS
this increased accuracy provided by haxat does not only result in improved homologue estimations, but also provides un-interrupted reading-frames, which greatly facilitate further analysis of protein space, for example phylogenetic analysis. the alignment tool is available at http://bioinfo.ifm.liu.se/454tools/haxat.
