BACKGROUND
increasing genetic and phenotypic differences found among natural isolates of c. elegans have encouraged researchers to explore the natural variation of this nematode species.


RESULTS
here we report on the identification of genomic differences between the reference strain n <dig> and the hawaiian strain cb <dig>  one of the most genetically distant strains from n <dig>  to identify both small- and large-scale genomic variations , we have sequenced the cb <dig> genome using both roche  <dig>  and illumina ga dna sequencing methods . compared to previously described variants , our effort uncovered twice as many single nucleotide variants  and increased the number of small indels almost 20-fold. moreover, we identified and validated large insertions, most of which range from 150 bps to  <dig>  kb in length in the cb <dig> strain. identified gvs had a widespread impact on protein-coding sequences, including  <dig> single-copy genes that have associated severe phenotypes of reduced viability in rnai and genetics studies. sixty of these genes are homologs of human genes associated with diseases. furthermore, our work confirms previously identified gvs associated with differences in behavioural and biological traits between the n <dig> and cb <dig> strains.


CONCLUSIONS
the identified gvs provide a rich resource for future studies that aim to explain the genetic basis for other trait differences between the n <dig> and cb <dig> strains.
