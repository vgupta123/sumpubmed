BACKGROUND
candida albicans biofilms are commonly found on indwelling medical devices. however, the molecular basis of biofilm formation and development is not completely understood. expression analysis of genes potentially involved in these processes, such as the als  gene family can be performed using quantitative pcr . in the present study, we investigated the expression stability of eight housekeeping genes potentially useful as reference genes to study gene expression in candida albicans  biofilms, using the genorm visual basic application  for microsoft excel. to validate our normalization strategies we determined differences in als <dig> and als <dig> expression levels between c. albicans biofilm cells and their planktonic counterparts.


RESULTS
the eight genes tested in this study are ranked according to their expression stability  as follows: act <dig> /pma <dig> , rip , rpp2b , lsc <dig> , imh <dig> , cpa <dig>  and gapdh .

our data indicate that five genes are necessary for accurate and reliable normalization of gene expression data in c. albicans biofilms. using different normalization strategies, we found a significant upregulation of the als <dig> gene and downregulation of the als <dig> gene in c. albicans biofilms grown on silicone disks in a continous flow system, the cdc reactor , for  <dig> hours.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we recommend the use of the geometric mean of the relative expression values from the five housekeeping genes  for normalization, when analysing differences in gene expression levels between c. albicans biofilm cells and planktonic cells. validation of the normalization strategies described above showed that the als <dig> gene is overexpressed and the als <dig> gene is underexpressed in c. albicans biofilms grown on silicone in the cdc reactor for  <dig> hours.
