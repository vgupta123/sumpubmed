BACKGROUND
whole and partial chromosome losses or gains and structural chromosome changes are hallmarks of human tumors. guanine-rich dna, which has a potential to form a g-quadruplex  structure, is particularly vulnerable to changes. in caenorhabditis elegans, faithful transmission of g-rich dna is ensured by the dog-1/fancj deadbox helicase.


RESULTS
to identify a spectrum of mutations, after long-term propagation, we combined whole genome sequencing  and oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization  analysis of a c. elegans strain that was propagated, in the absence of dog- <dig> and mdf-1/mad <dig>  for a total of  <dig> generations, with samples taken for long term storage  in generations  <dig> and  <dig>  we compared the genomes of f <dig> and f <dig> strains and identified  <dig> substitutions,  <dig> indels,  <dig> duplications, and  <dig> deletions larger than 20 bp. these homozygous variants were predicted to impact  <dig> protein-coding genes. phenotypic analysis of this strain revealed remarkable fitness recovery indicating that mutations, which have accumulated in the strain, are not only tolerated but also cooperate to achieve long-term population survival in the absence of dog- <dig> and mdf- <dig>  furthermore, deletions larger than 20 bp were the only variants that frequently occurred in g-rich dna. we showed that  <dig> of the possible  <dig> predicted monog/c tracts, larger than 14 bp, were deleted in unc- <dig> mdf- <dig> such-4; dog-1 f <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
here, we identified variants that accumulated in c. elegans’ genome after long-term propagation in the absence of dog- <dig> and mdf- <dig>  we showed that dna sequences, with g4-forming potential, are vulnerable to deletion-formation in this genetic background.
