BACKGROUND
the contributions of brain cannabinoid  receptors, typically cb <dig>  receptors, to the behavioral effects of nicotine  have been reported to involve brain transient receptor potential vanilloid  <dig>  receptors, and the activation of candidate endogenous trpv <dig> ligands is expected to be therapeutically effective. in the present study, the effects of trpv <dig> ligands with or without affinity for cb <dig> receptors were examined on nc-induced depression-like behavioral alterations in a mouse model in order to elucidate the "antidepressant-like" contributions of trpv <dig> receptors against the nc-induced "depression" observed in various types of tobacco abuse.


RESULTS
repeated subcutaneous nc treatments , like repeated immobilization stress  , caused depression-like behavioral alterations in both the forced swimming  and the tail suspension  tests, at the  <dig> h time point after the last treatment. in both nc and im groups, the trpv <dig> agonists capsaicin  and olvanil  administered intraperitoneally provided significant antidepressant-like attenuation against these behavioral alterations, whereas the trpv <dig> antagonist capsazepine  did not attenuate any depression-like behaviors. furthermore, the endogenous trpv1-agonistic cb <dig> agonists anandamide  and n-arachidonyldopamine  did not have any antidepressant-like effects. nevertheless, a synthetic "hybrid" agonist of cb <dig> and trpv <dig> receptors, arvanil , caused significant antidepressant-like effects. the antidepressant-like effects of cp and ol were antagonized by the trpv <dig> antagonist cz. however, the antidepressant-like effects of ar were not antagonized by either cz or the cb <dig> antagonist am  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
the antidepressant-like effects of trpv <dig> agonists shown in the present study suggest a characteristic involvement of trpv <dig> receptors in nc-induced depression-like behaviors, similar to those caused by im. the strong antidepressant-like effects of the potent trpv <dig> plus cb <dig> agonist ar, which has been reported to cause part of its trpv1-mimetic and cannabimimetic effects presumably via non-trpv <dig> or non-cb <dig> mechanisms support a contribution from other sites of action which may play a therapeutically important role in the treatment of nc abuse.
