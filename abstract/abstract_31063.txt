BACKGROUND
dilated cardiomyopathy  and chronic mitral valve disease  in dogs are associated with heart chamber enlargement, also of the left atrium. dcm is often accompanied by rhythm disturbances . in cmvd, arrhythmias are observed less frequently. it is still unclear whether left atrial enlargement in these diseases results from volume overload or if it is also connected with other factors .

this study was conducted on the left atrial myocardial specimens from  <dig> dogs, including those from  <dig> dogs with clinically diagnosed dcm and  <dig> dogs with cmvd. after fixation and staining , the specimens underwent evaluation. parenchymal changes , degenerative changes  and the presence of inflammatory infiltrates were assessed.


RESULTS
more interstitial fibrosis  and less perivascular fibrosis  was observed in the dcm group compared to the cmvd group. moreover, less distinct vessel narrowing was observed in the dcm group than in the cmvd group . dogs with dcm showed more strongly defined degenerative changes than the cmvd dogs .


CONCLUSIONS
the obtained results indicate a different nature of changes occurring in the left atrial myocardium of dogs with dcm compared to dogs with mitral valve disease, including differences in vessel narrowing, cardiomyocyte degeneration and in the distribution of connective tissue.
