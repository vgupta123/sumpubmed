BACKGROUND
during the development of the central nervous system, oligodendrocytes generate large amounts of myelin, a multilayered insulating membrane that ensheathes axons, thereby allowing the fast conduction of the action potential and maintaining axonal integrity. differentiation of oligodendrocytes to myelin-forming cells requires the downregulation of rhoa gtpase activity.


RESULTS
to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of oligodendrocyte differentiation, we performed microarray expression profiling of the oligodendroglial cell line, oli-neu, treated with the rho kinase  inhibitor, y- <dig> or with conditioned neuronal medium. this resulted in the identification of the transmembrane protein  <dig> , a novel type i transmembrane protein enriched in differentiating oligodendrocytes. in primary cultures, tmem <dig> was abundantly expressed in o4-positive oligodendrocytes, but not in oligodendroglial precursor cells, astrocytes, microglia or neurons. in mature oligodendrocytes tmem <dig> was enriched in the rims and processes of the cells and was only found to a lesser extent in the membrane sheets.


CONCLUSIONS
together, our results demonstrate that tmem <dig> is a novel marker for in vitro generated oligodendrocytes.
