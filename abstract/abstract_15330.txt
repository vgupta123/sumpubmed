BACKGROUND
forward genetic approaches have limited use for agronomic traits that can’t be reliably scored on a single plant basis. thus, mutants in wheat and other crops are more useful for gene function studies by reverse genetic approach. with a long-term goal to develop a sequence-based mutation detection resource in hexaploid wheat, we conducted a feasibility study to accurately differentiate induced mutations from the homoeologs’ sequence variations present among the three wheat genomes.


RESULTS
a reduced representation apeki library consisting of  <dig> ethylmethane sulfonate  induced mutants and two wild type cv. indian plants was developed using individual barcode adapters and sequenced. a novel bioinformatics pipeline was developed to identify sequence variants using  <dig>  wheat unigenes as a reference wheat transcriptome. in total,  <dig>  mutational changes  and  <dig>  homoeologous sequence changes were detected. on an average,  <dig> snps  and  <dig> small indels  were identified for each of the mutants. a mutation frequency of one per  <dig> kb was observed with  <dig> % being transitions and  <dig> % transversions. the pipeline was tested using the known sequence changes in the three wheat genes. genes present in the distal regions of the chromosomes were found to be more prone to ems compared to genes present in the proximal regions. redefined parameters identified a total of  <dig>  mutational changes .


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that sequencing based mutation detection is a valuable method to identify induced mutations at large.
