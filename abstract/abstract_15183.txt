BACKGROUND
genetically manipulated embryonic stem  cell derived neurons  provide a powerful system with which to study the consequences of gene manipulation in mature, synaptically connected neurons in vitro. here we report a study of focal adhesion kinase , which has been implicated in synapse formation and regulation of ion channels, using the esn system to circumvent the embryonic lethality of homozygous fak mutant mice.


RESULTS
mouse es cells carrying homozygous null mutations  were generated and differentiated in vitro into neurons. fak-/- esns extended axons and dendrites and formed morphologically and electrophysiologically intact synapses. a detailed study of nmda receptor gated currents and voltage sensitive calcium currents revealed no difference in their magnitude, or modulation by tyrosine kinases.


CONCLUSIONS
fak does not have an obligatory role in neuronal differentiation, synapse formation or the expression of nmda receptor or voltage-gated calcium currents under the conditions used in this study. the use of genetically modified esns has great potential for rapidly and effectively examining the consequences of neuronal gene manipulation and is complementary to mouse studies.
