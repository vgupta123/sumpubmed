BACKGROUND
we have recently reported the expression of murine implantation serine proteinase genes in pre-implantation embryos  and uterus . these proteinases belong to the s <dig> proteinase family and are similar to mast cell tryptases, which function as multimers.


RESULTS
here, we report the purification and initial characterization of isp <dig> and  <dig> with respect to their physico-chemical properties and physiological function. in addition to being co-expressed in uterus, we show that isp <dig> and isp <dig> are also co-expressed in the pre-implantation embryo. together, they form a heterodimer with an approximate molecular weight of  <dig> kd. this complex is the active form of the enzyme, which we have further characterized as being trypsin-like, based on substrate and inhibitor specificities. in addition to having a role in embryo hatching and outgrowth, we demonstrate that isp enzyme is localized to the site of embryo invasion during implantation and that its activity is important for successful implantation in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
on the basis of similarities in structural, chemical, and functional properties, we suggest that this isp enzyme complex represents the classical hatching enzyme, strypsin. our results demonstrate a critical role for isp in embryo hatching and implantation.
