BACKGROUND
the lives of half a million children in the united states are severely affected due to the alterations in their functional and mental abilities which epilepsy causes. this study aims to introduce a novel decision support system for the diagnosis of pediatric epilepsy based on scalp eeg data in a clinical environment.

methods
a new time varying approach for constructing functional connectivity networks  of  <dig> subjects  group and  <dig> subjects from pediatric epilepsy  group) is implemented by moving a window with overlap to split the eeg signals into a total of  <dig> multi-channel eeg segments  and finding the hypothetical functional connectivity strengths among eeg channels. fcns are then mapped into the form of undirected graphs and subjected to extraction of graph theory based features. an unsupervised labeling technique based on gaussian mixtures model  is then used to delineate the pediatric epilepsy group from the control group.


RESULTS
the study results show the existence of a statistically significant difference  between the mean fcns of pc and pe groups. the system was able to diagnose pediatric epilepsy subjects with the accuracy of  <dig> % with  <dig> % sensitivity and 100% specificity purely based on exploration of associations among brain cortical regions and without a priori knowledge of diagnosis.


CONCLUSIONS
the current study created the potential of diagnosing epilepsy without need for long eeg recording session and time-consuming visual inspection as conventionally employed.
