BACKGROUND
moderate electric field  technology is a promising food preservation strategy since it relies on physical properties—rather than chemical additives—to preserve solid cellular foods during storage. however, the effectiveness of long-term mef exposure on the psychrotrophic microorganisms responsible for the food spoilage at cool temperatures remains unclear.


RESULTS
the spoilage-associated psychrotroph pseudomonas fragi mc <dig> was obtained from pork samples stored at  <dig> °c. continuous mef treatment attenuated growth and resulted in subsequent adaptation of m <dig> cultured on nutrient agar plates at  <dig> °c, compared to the control cultures, as determined by biomass analysis and plating procedures. moreover, intracellular dehydrogenase activity and atp levels also indicated an initial effect of mef treatment followed by cellular recovery, and extracellular β-galactosidase activity assays indicated no obvious changes in cell membrane permeability. furthermore, microscopic observations using scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed that mef induced sublethal cellular injury during early treatment stages, but no notable changes in morphology or cytology on subsequent days.


CONCLUSIONS
our study provides direct evidence that psychrotrophic p. fragi mc <dig> cultured on nutrient agar plates at  <dig> °c are capable of adapting to mef treatment.
