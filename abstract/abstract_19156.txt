BACKGROUND
spiroplasma citri br3-3x and s. kunkelii cr2-3x cause serious diseases worldwide on citrus and maize species, respectively. s. citri br3-3x harbors a plasmid, pbjs-original , that encodes the spiroplasma adhesion related protein  <dig> , a protein implicated in binding of the pathogen to cells of its leafhopper vector, circulifer tenellus. the s. kunkelii cr2-3x plasmid, psku <dig>  encodes a homolog of sarp <dig>  sk-arp <dig>  due to the close phylogenetic relationship of the two pathogens, we hypothesized that the two plasmids are closely related as well.


RESULTS
the nucleotide sequence of pbjs-o was determined and compared to the sequences of a plasmid from br3-t , which is a multiply passaged leafhopper transmissible derivative of br3-3x, and to known plasmid sequences including that of psku <dig>  in addition to arp <dig>  the  <dig>  bp pbjs-o sequence putatively contains nine genes, recognized as open reading frames . several pbjs-o orfs have homologs on psku <dig>  however, the sequences flanking soj-like genes on both plasmids were found to be more distant from one another than sequences in any other region. further, unlike psku <dig>  pbjs-o lacks the conserved orit region characteristic of the incp group of bacterial plasmids. we were unable to identify a region in pbjs-o resembling a known plasmid origin of transfer. in regions where sequence was available for the plasmid from both br3-3x and br3-t, the pbjs-t sequence had a  <dig>  kb deletion relative to its progenitor, pbjs-o. southern blot hybridization of extrachromosomal dna from various s. citri strains and spiroplasma species to an arp-specific probe and a probe made from the entire plasmid dna of br3-3x revealed limited conservation of both sequences in the genus spiroplasma. finally, we also report the presence on the br3-3x chromosome of arp <dig>  an s. citri homolog of arp <dig> that encodes the predicted protein sarp <dig>  the c-terminal domain of sarp <dig> is homologous to that of sarp <dig>  but its n-terminal domain is distinct.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that pbjs is a novel s. citri plasmid that does not belong to any known plasmid incompatibility group. the differences between pbjs-o and psku <dig> suggest that one or more events of recombination have contributed to the divergence of the plasmids of the two sister spiroplasma species; the plasmid from s. citri itself has diverged slightly during the derivation of s. citri br3-t from br3-3x. our data also show that pbjs-o encodes the putative adhesin sarp <dig>  the presence of trae and mob on pbjs-o suggests a role for the plasmid in spiroplasmal conjugation.
