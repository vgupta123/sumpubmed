BACKGROUND
matrix metalloproteinases  <dig> and  <dig>  are increased in the brain after experimental ischemic stroke in rats. these two proteases are involved with the degradation of the basal lamina and loss of stability of the blood brain barrier that occurs after ischemia and that is associated with thrombolytic therapy in ischemic stroke. minocycline is a lipophilic tetracycline and is neuroprotective in several models of brain injury. minocycline inhibits inflammation, apoptosis and extracellular matrix degradation. in this study we investigated whether delayed minocycline inhibits brain mmps activated by ischemia in a model of temporary occlusion in wistar rats.


RESULTS
both mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> were elevated in the ischemic tissue as compared to the contra-lateral hemisphere after  <dig> hours occlusion and  <dig> hours survival . intraperitoneal minocycline at  <dig> mg/kg concentration twice a day  significantly reduced gelatinolytic activity of ischemia-elevated mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> . treatment also reduced protein concentration of both enzymes . in vitro incubation of minocycline in concentrations as low as  <dig>  Î¼g/ml with recombinant mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> impaired enzymatic activity and mmp- <dig> was more sensitive at lower minocycline concentrations .


CONCLUSIONS
minocycline inhibits enzymatic activity of gelatin proteases activated by ischemia after experimental stroke and is likely to be selective for mmp- <dig> at low doses. minocycline is a potential new therapeutic agent to acute treatment of ischemic stroke.
