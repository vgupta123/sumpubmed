BACKGROUND
there have been increasing attentions on the role of small rnas, especially micrornas in post-transcriptional gene regulation during spermatogenesis. microrna- <dig>  has been shown to be mainly expressed in the testis and brain, and that its expression levels are by far the highest in the testis. however, the role of mir- <dig> in mammalian spermatogenesis remains unclear.


RESULTS
in this study, we demonstrated that mir- <dig> levels were increased during mouse postnatal testis development. specifically, mir- <dig> expression was restricted to the germ cells from spermatogonia to round spermatids. overexpression of mir- <dig> promoted the proliferation of a germ cell line, gc-1spg. moreover, mir- <dig> downregulated nuclear receptor corepressor  <dig>  by targeting its 3' untranslated region through inhibiting ncor <dig> protein translation.


CONCLUSIONS
mir- <dig> may be involved in the post-transcription regulation of mrnas such as ncor <dig> in mammalian spermatogenesis.
