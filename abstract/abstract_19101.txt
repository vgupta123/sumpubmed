BACKGROUND
methods are now available for the prediction of interaction sites in protein 3d structures. while many of these methods report high success rates for site prediction, often these predictions are not very selective and have low precision. precision in site prediction is addressed using theoretical microscopic titration curves , a simple computational method for the identification of active sites in enzymes. recall and precision are measured and compared with other methods for the prediction of catalytic sites.


RESULTS
using a test set of  <dig> enzymes from the original catalytic residue dataset  it is shown that thematics can deliver precise, localised site predictions. furthermore, adjustment of the cut-off criteria can improve the recall rates for catalytic residues with only a small sacrifice in precision. recall rates for catres/csa annotated catalytic residues are  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % for z score cut-off values of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. the corresponding precision rates are  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %. the success rate for catalytic sites is higher, with correct or partially correct predictions for  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the enzymes in the test set, corresponding to the same respective z score cut-offs, if only the catres annotations are used as the reference set. incorporation of additional literature annotations into the reference set gives total success rates of  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, again for corresponding cut-off values of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . false positive rates for a 75-protein test set are  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % for z score cut-offs of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
with a preferred cut-off value of  <dig> , thematics achieves a high success rate of interaction site prediction, about 86% correct or partially correct using catres/csa annotations only and about 93% with an expanded reference set. success rates for catalytic residue prediction are similar to those of other structure-based methods, but with substantially better precision and lower false positive rates. thematics performs well across the spectrum of e.c. classes. the method requires only the structure of the query protein as input. thematics predictions may be obtained via the web from structures in pdb format at:
