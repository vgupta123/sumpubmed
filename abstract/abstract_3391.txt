BACKGROUND
while it is well known that bradykinin b <dig> agonists increase plasma protein extravasation  in brain tumors, the bradykinin b <dig> agonists tested thus far are unable to produce this effect. here we examine the effect of the selective b <dig> agonist bradykinin  sar-des-arg9bk , a compound resistant to enzymatic degradation with prolonged activity on ppe in the blood circulation in the c <dig> rat glioma model.


RESULTS
sar administration significantly enhanced ppe in c <dig> rat brain glioma compared to saline or bk . pre-administration of the bradykinin b <dig> antagonist -des-arg  blocked the sar-induced ppe in the tumor area.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that the b <dig> receptor modulates ppe in the blood tumor barrier of c <dig> glioma. a possible role for the use of sar in the chemotherapy of gliomas deserves further study.
