BACKGROUND
crispr is a versatile gene editing tool which has revolutionized genetic research in the past few years. optimizing sgrna design to improve the efficiency of target/dna cleavage is critical to ensure the success of crispr screens.


RESULTS
by borrowing knowledge from oligonucleotide design and nucleosome occupancy models, we systematically evaluated candidate features computed from a number of nucleic acid, thermodynamic and secondary structure models on real crispr datasets. our results showed that taking into account position-dependent dinucleotide features improved the design of effective sgrnas with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve  > <dig> , and the inclusion of additional features offered marginal improvement .


CONCLUSIONS
using a machine-learning approach, we proposed an accurate prediction model for sgrna design efficiency. an r package predictsgrna implementing the predictive model is available at http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/~pfkuan/softwares.html#predictsgrna.
