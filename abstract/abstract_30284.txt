BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a family of short, non-coding rnas modulating expression of human protein coding genes . their dysfunction is associated with many human diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders. it has been recently shown that genomic copy number variations  can cause aberrant expression of integral mirnas and their target genes, and contribute to intellectual disability .


RESULTS
to better understand the cnv-mirna relationship in id, we investigated the prevalence and function of mirnas and mirna target genes in five groups of cnvs. three groups of cnvs were from  <dig> probands with id , one group of cnvs was from a cohort of  <dig> cognitively normal subjects  and one group of cnvs represented  <dig> id related syndromic regions listed in decipher  which served as positive controls for cnvs causing or predisposing to id. our results show that 1). the number of mirnas is significantly higher in de novo or decipher cnvs than in familial or common cnv subgroups . 2). mirnas with brain related functions are more prevalent in de novo cnv groups compared to common cnv groups. 3). more mirna target genes are found in de novo, familial and decipher cnvs than in the common cnv subgroup . 4). the mapk signaling cascade is found to be enriched among the mirna target genes from de novo and decipher cnv subgroups.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings reveal an increase in mirna and mirna target gene content in de novo versus common cnvs in subjects with id. their expression profile and participation in pathways support a possible role of mirna copy number change in cognition and/or cnv-mediated developmental delay. systematic analysis of expression/function of mirnas in addition to coding genes integral to cnvs could uncover new causes of id.
