BACKGROUND
insertion elements  are known to play an important role in the evolution and genomic diversification of escherichia coli o157:h <dig> lineages. in particular, is <dig> has been found in multiple copies in the e. coli o157:h <dig> genome and is one of the most prevalent is in this serotype. it was recently shown that the lack of o <dig> antigen expression in two o rough e. coli o157:h <dig> strains was due to is <dig> insertions at  <dig> different locations in the gne gene that is essential for the o antigen biosynthesis.


RESULTS
the comparison of  <dig> e. coli o157:h <dig> genome and plasmid sequences showed numerous is <dig> insertion sites, although not uniformly distributed among strains. comparison of is629s found in o157:h <dig> and o55:h <dig> showed the presence of at least three different is <dig> sub-types. o157:h <dig> strains carry is <dig> elements sub-type i and iii whereby the ancestral o55:h <dig> carries sub-type ii. analysis of strains selected from various clonal groups defined on the e. coli o157:h <dig> stepwise evolution model showed that is <dig> was not observed in sorbitol fermenting o <dig>  clones that are on a divergent pathway in the emergence of o157:h <dig>  this suggests that the absence of is <dig> in sfo <dig> strains probably occurred during the divergence of this lineage, albeit it remains uncertain if it contributed, in part, to their divergence from other closely related strains.


CONCLUSIONS
the highly variable genomic locations of is <dig> in o157:h <dig> strains of the a <dig> clonal complex indicates that this insertion element probably played an important role in genome plasticity and in the divergence of o157:h <dig> lineages.
