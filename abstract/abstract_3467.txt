BACKGROUND
the central asian strain <dig>  genogroup of mycobacterium tuberculosis  is the most prevalent in pakistan, india and bangladesh. mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units variable number tandem repeat  typing is a reliable and reproducible method for differentiation of mtb isolates. however, information of its utility in determining the diversity of cas <dig> strain is limited. we performed standard  <dig> loci based miru-vntr typing on previously spoligotyped cas <dig> strains and 'unique' strains in order to evaluate its discriminatory power for these isolates.

methods
twelve loci based miru- vntr typing was used to type <dig> cas <dig> and  <dig> 'unique' mtb strains. the discriminatory index for each of the loci was calculated using the hunter gaston discriminatory index . a subset of these strains  were typed using is <dig> restriction fragment length polymorphism . miru-vntr profiles were studied together with their drug susceptibility patterns.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> miru patterns were obtained for the  <dig> strains tested. the cas <dig> strains were subdivided into  <dig> distinct patterns;  <dig> clusters of  <dig> strains each,  <dig> cluster of four strains and  <dig> unique patterns. using hgdi, seven miru loci,  were found to be "highly discriminatory" , four miru loci  were "moderately discriminatory" , and one locus  was "poorly discriminatory" . loci  <dig> and  <dig> were the most discriminatory for the cas <dig> isolates. amongst 'unique' strains in addition to loci  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  locus  <dig> was highly discriminatory, while no locus was poorly discriminating. di values for loci  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were significantly lower  in cas <dig> strains than in 'unique' strains. the association between cas <dig> strains and mdr was not found to be significant .


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that miru typing could be used to estimate the phylogenetic relatedness amongst prevalent cas <dig> strains, for which miru loci  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were found to be the most discriminatory.
