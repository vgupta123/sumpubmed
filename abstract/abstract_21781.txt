BACKGROUND
the genetic diversity of mycoplasma agalactiae  isolates collected in spain from goats in an area with contagious agalactia  was assessed using a set of validated and new molecular typing methods. validated methods included pulsed field gel electrophoresis , variable number of tandem repeats  typing, and southern blot hybridization using a set of ma dna probes, including those for typing the vpma genes repertoire. new approaches were based on pcr and targeted genomic regions that diverged between strains as defined by in silico genomic comparisons of sequenced ma genomes.


RESULTS
overall, the data showed that all typing tools yielded consistent results, with the vntr analyses being the most rapid method to differentiate the ma isolates with a discriminatory ability comparable to that of pfge and of a set of new pcr assays. all molecular typing approaches indicated that the spanish isolates from the endemic area in murcia were very diverse, with different clonal isolates probably restricted to separate, but geographically close, local areas.


CONCLUSIONS
the important genetic diversity of ma observed in infected goats from spain contrasts with the overall homogeneity of the genomic background encountered in ma from sheep with ca in southern france or italy, suggesting that assessment of the disease status in endemic areas may require different approaches in sheep and in goats. a number of congruent sub-typing tools are now available for the differentiation of caprine isolates with comparable discriminatory powers.
