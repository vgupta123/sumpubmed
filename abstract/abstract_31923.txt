BACKGROUND
micrornas , involving in various biological and metabolic processes, have been discovered and analyzed in quite a number of plants species, such as arabidopsis, rice and other plants. however, there have been few reports about grapevine mirnas in response to gibberelline .


RESULTS
solexa technology was used to sequence small rna libraries constructed from grapevine berries treated with ga <dig> and the control. a total of  <dig> known and  <dig> novel grapevine mirnas  were identified. totally,  <dig> ones were found to be clearly responsive to ga <dig>  among which  <dig> were down-regulated,  <dig> were up-regulated,  <dig> could only be detected in the control, and seven were only detected in the treatment. subsequently, we found that  <dig> of them were differentially regulated by ga <dig>  with  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel vvi-mirnas, based on the analysis of qrt-pcr essays. there existed some consistency in expression levels of ga3-responsive vvi-mirnas between high throughput sequencing and qrt-pcr essays. in addition,  <dig> target genes for  <dig> novel mirnas were predicted.


CONCLUSIONS
deep sequencing of short rnas from grapevine berries treated with ga <dig> and the control identified  <dig> ga3-responsive mirnas, among which  <dig> exhibited different expression profiles of response to ga <dig> in the diverse developmental stages of grapevine berries. these identified vvi-mirnas might be involved in the grapevine berry development and response to environmental stresses.
