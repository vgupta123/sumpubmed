BACKGROUND
emerging infectious diseases threaten na√Øve host populations with extinction. chytridiomycosis, an emerging infectious disease of amphibians, is caused by the pathogenic fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis  and has been linked to global declines in amphibians.


RESULTS
we monitored the prevalence of bd for four years in the northern leopard frog, rana pipiens, which is critically imperiled in british columbia , canada. the prevalence of bd initially increased and then remained constant over the last three years of the study. young of the year emerging from breeding ponds in summer were rarely infected with bd. some individuals cleared their bd infections and the return rate between infected and uninfected individuals was not significantly different.


CONCLUSIONS
the bc population of r. pipiens appears to have evolved a level of resistance that allows it to co-exist with bd. however, this small population of r. pipiens remains vulnerable to extinction.
