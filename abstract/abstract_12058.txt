BACKGROUND
herpes simplex virus  gene expression is thought to shut off recombinant gene expression from hsv- <dig> vectors; however, in a helper virus-free hsv- <dig> vector system, a number of promoters support only short-term expression. these results raise the paradox that recombinant gene expression remains short-term even in the absence of almost all  of the hsv- <dig> genome, hsv- <dig> genes, and hsv- <dig> gene expression. to resolve this paradox, we hypothesized that specific proteins in the hsv- <dig> virus particle shut off recombinant gene expression. in two earlier studies, we examined the effects on recombinant gene expression of packaging vectors using specific mutated hsv- <dig> proteins. we found that vectors packaged using mutated ul <dig> , or vp <dig>  or ul <dig> and/or ul <dig>  supported improved long-term expression, and vectors packaged using mutated ul <dig> and/or ul <dig> also supported improved gene transfer . these results suggested the hypothesis that specific proteins in the hsv- <dig> particle act by multiple pathways to reduce recombinant gene expression. to test this hypothesis, we examined combinations of mutated proteins that included both ul <dig> and specific components of the vp <dig> transcriptional complex.


RESULTS
a hsv- <dig> vector containing a neuronal-specific promoter was packaged using specific combinations of mutated proteins, and the resulting vector stocks were tested in the rat striatum. for supporting long-term expression, the preferred combination of mutated hsv- <dig> proteins was mutated ul <dig>  ul <dig>  and ul <dig>  vectors packaged using this combination of mutated proteins supported a higher efficiency of gene transfer and high levels expression for  <dig> months, the longest time examined.


CONCLUSIONS
vector particles containing this combination of mutated hsv- <dig> proteins improve recombinant gene expression. implications of these results for strategies to further improve long-term expression are discussed. moreover, long-term expression will benefit specific gene therapy applications.
