BACKGROUND
the role of m <dig> polarized macrophages  during the allergic airway inflammation has been discussed in various animal models. however, their presence and relevance during the chronic and acute phase of allergic airway inflammation in humans has not been fully elucidated so far. in the present study we phenotypically characterized macrophages with regard to m <dig> polarization in mice, a human in vitro and a human ex vivo model with primary lung cells after endobronchial provocation.


RESULTS
macrophages remained polarized beyond clearance of the acute allergic airway inflammation in mice. alveolar macrophages of asthmatics revealed increased mrna expression of ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and clec10a in response to allergen challenge as well as increased surface expression of cd <dig>  further, mrna expression of ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and clec10a was increased in asthmatics at baseline compared to healthy subjects. the mrna expression of ccl <dig> and clec10a correlated significantly with the degree of eosinophilia . furthermore, macrophages from asthmatics released significant amounts of ccl <dig> protein in vitro which was also found increased in bal fluid after allergen provocation.


CONCLUSIONS
this study supports previous findings of m <dig> macrophage polarization in asthmatic subjects during the acute course of the allergic inflammation and provides evidence for their contribution to the th <dig> inflammation.
