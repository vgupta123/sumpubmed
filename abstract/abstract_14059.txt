BACKGROUND
transforming growth factor-β <dig>  plays a key role in mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition  during peritoneal dialysis . however, the role of akt in mmt transformation in pd is not clear.


RESULTS
in this study, we observed that the phosphorylated form of protein kinase b , termed as pakt, was up-regulated in the peritoneum of mice undergoing pd. it was associated with thickening of the peritoneum and up-regulation of tgf-β <dig>  upregulation of pakt paralleled with the increased expression of smad ubiquitination regulatory factor  <dig> , vimentin and fibronectin , and decreased expression of mothers against decapentaplegic homolog  <dig>  and zonula occludens protein  <dig> in mice undergoing pd treatment and in tgf-β <dig> induced human peritoneal mesothelial cells . these changes were reversed with the treatment of a pi3k/akt inhibitor ly <dig> in vivo or in cells transfected with akt dominant-negative  plasmids in vitro. increased smurf <dig> expression in hpmcs, induced by tgf-β <dig> was accompanied with altered expression of transforming growth factor receptor i , smad <dig>  zo- <dig>  vimentin and fn via akt modulation. in addition, inhibition of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase  <dig>  decreased tgf- β1-induced expression of tβr-i and reversed the altered expression of smad <dig>  smurf <dig>  zo- <dig> and vimentin. moreover, tgf-β <dig> accentuated the interactions between smurf <dig> and smad <dig>  while reduced the association between tβr-i and smurf <dig>  these interactions were reversed by the treatment of akt-dn and usp <dig> sirna, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
these data implied that akt mediated mmt in pd via smurf <dig> modulation/and or smad <dig> degradation while conceivably maintaining the tβri stability, most likely by the usp <dig>
