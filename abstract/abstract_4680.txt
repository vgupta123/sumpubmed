BACKGROUND
ra  signal pathway has been proved to be required for germ cell meiotic initiation in mammals, aves and amphibians. stra <dig>  is an important factor in ra signal pathway. however, the role of ra and stra <dig> in germ cell meiotic initiation in teleosts is poorly characterized.


RESULTS
in this study, the full length cdna of stra <dig> was cloned from southern catfish , and its spatio-temporal expression profiles were analyzed. the stra <dig> cdna  includes  <dig> bp 5’-utr ,  <dig> bp 3’-utr, and an orf  of  <dig> bp, encoding a polypeptide of  <dig> aa. phylogenetic analysis revealed its existence in some primitive teleosts, such as siluriformes and salmoniformes. tissue distribution analysis by rt-pcr showed that stra <dig> is specifically expressed in gonads. by real-time pcr, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, the highest expression level of stra8/stra <dig> was detected in  <dig> and  <dig> dah , the premeiotic stage of germ cells in xx and xy gonads, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that stra <dig> might be involved in germ cell meiotic initiation in s. meridionalis as it did in tetrapods.
