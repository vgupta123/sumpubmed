BACKGROUND
staphylococcus epidermidis is a commensal bacterium but can colonize the hospital environment due to its ability to form biofilms favouring adhesion to host tissues, medical devices and increasing resistance to antibiotics. in this context, the use of phages to destroy biofilms is an interesting alternative.


RESULTS
the complete genomes of two staphylococcus epidermidis bacteriophages, vb_sepis-phiipla <dig> and vb_sepis-phiipla <dig>  have been analyzed. their genomes are  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, and contain  <dig> and  <dig> orfs. bioinformatic analyses enabled the assignment of putative functions to  <dig> and  <dig> gene products, respectively, including dna packaging and morphogenetic proteins, lysis components, and proteins necessary for dna recombination, regulation, modification and replication. a point mutation in vb_sepis-phiipla <dig> lysogeny control-associated genes explained its strictly lytic behaviour. comparative analysis of phi-ipla <dig> and phi-ipla <dig> genome structure resembled those of s. epidermidis ϕph <dig> and ϕcnph <dig> phages. a mosaic structure of s. epidermidis prophage genomes was revealed by pcr analysis of three marker genes . using these genes, high prevalence  of phage dna in a representative s. epidermidis strain collection consisting of  <dig> isolates from women with mastitis and healthy women was determined. putative pectin lyase-like domains detected in virion-associated proteins of both phages could be involved in exopolysaccharide  depolymerization, as evidenced by both the presence of a clear halo surrounding the phage lysis zone and the phage-mediated biofilm degradation.


CONCLUSIONS
staphylococcus epidermidis bacteriophages, vb_sepis-phiipla <dig> and vb_sepis-phiipla <dig>  have a mosaic structure similar to other widespread s. epidermidis prophages. virions of these phages are provided of pectin lyase-like domains, which may be regarded as promising anti-biofilm tools.
