BACKGROUND
protein phosphatases  play critical roles in various cellular processes through the reversible protein phosphorylation that dictates many signal transduction pathways among organisms. recently, pps in arabidopsis and rice have been identified, while the whole complement of pps in maize is yet to be reported.


RESULTS
in this study, we have identified  <dig> pp-encoding genes in the maize genome. phylogenetic analyses categorized the zmpp gene family into  <dig> classes  with considerable conservation among classes. similar intron/exon structural patterns were observed in the same classes. moreover, detailed gene structures and duplicative events were then researched. the expression profiles of zmpps under different developmental stages and abiotic stresses  were analyzed using microarray and rna-seq data. a total of  <dig> members were detected in  <dig> different tissues representing distinct stages of maize plant developments. under salt stress, one gene was significantly up-expressed in seed root  and one gene was down-expressed in primary root  and crown root , respectively. as for drought stress condition,  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed in leaf, out of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> exhibited down-regulation. additionally,  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes were found in cold-tolerant line eth-dh <dig>  furthermore, real-time pcr was used to confirm the expression patterns of zmpps.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide new insights into the phylogenetic relationships and characteristic functions of maize pps and will be useful in studies aimed at revealing the global regulatory network in maize abiotic stress responses, thereby contributing to the maize molecular breeding with enhanced quality traits.
