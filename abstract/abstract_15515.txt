BACKGROUND
the rb <dig> gene was the first tumor suppressor gene cloned from humans by studying genetic lesions in families with retinoblastoma. children who inherit one defective copy of the rb <dig> gene have an increased susceptibility to retinoblastoma. several years after the identification of the human rb <dig> gene, a targeted deletion of rb was generated in mice. mice with one defective copy of the rb gene do not develop retinoblastoma. in this manuscript, we explore the different roles of the rb family in human and mouse retinal development in order to better understand the species-specific difference in retinoblastoma susceptibility.


RESULTS
we found that the rb family of proteins  are expressed in a dynamic manner during mouse retinal development. the primary rb family member expressed in proliferating embryonic retinal progenitor cells in mice is p <dig>  which is required for appropriate cell cycle exit during retinogenesis. the primary rb family member expressed in proliferating postnatal retinal progenitor cells is rb. p <dig> protein is expressed redundantly with rb in postmitotic cells of the inner nuclear layer and the ganglion cell layer of the mouse retina. when rb is inactivated in an acute or chronic manner during mouse retinal development, p <dig> is upregulated in a compensatory manner. similarly, when p <dig> is inactivated in the mouse retina, rb is upregulated. no changes in p <dig> expression were seen when p <dig>  rb or both were inactivated in the developing mouse retina. in the human retina, rb <dig> was the primary family member expressed throughout development. there was very little if any p <dig> expressed in the developing human retina. in contrast to the developing mouse retina, when rb <dig> was acutely inactivated in the developing human fetal retina, p <dig> was not upregulated in a compensatory manner.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that intrinsic genetic compensation between rb and p <dig> prevents retinoblastoma in rb- or p107-deficient mice, but this compensation does not occur in humans. together, these data suggest a model that explains why humans are susceptible to retinoblastoma following rb <dig> loss, but mice require both rb and p <dig> gene inactivation.
