BACKGROUND
serologic surveillance of avian influenza  viruses is carried out by the hemagglutination inhibition  test using reference reagents. this method is recommended by animal health organizations as a standard test to detect antigenic differences  between circulating influenza virus, vaccine- and/or reference- strains. however, significant discrepancies between reference antisera and field isolates have been observed during serosurveillance of influenza a viruses in pig and poultry farms. the objective of this study was to examine the effects of influenza virus genetic and antigenic drift on serologic testing using standard hi assays and reference reagents. low pathogenic ai h5n <dig> viruses isolated in mexico between  <dig> and  <dig> were used for phylogenetic analysis of ai hemagglutinin genes and for serologic testing using antisera produced with year-specific ai virus isolates.


RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis revealed significant divergence between early lpai h5n <dig> viruses  and more recent virus field isolates . results of the hi test were markedly influenced by the selection of the ai h5n <dig> virus  used as reference antigen for the assay. these analyses indicate that lpai h5n <dig> viruses in mexico are constantly undergoing genetic drift and that serosurveillance of ai viruses is significantly influenced by the antigen or antisera used for the hi test.


CONCLUSIONS
reference viral antigens and/or antisera need to be replaced constantly during surveillance of ai viruses to keep pace with the ai antigenic drift. this strategy should improve the estimation of antigenic differences between circulating ai viruses and the selection of suitable vaccine strains.
