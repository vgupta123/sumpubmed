BACKGROUND
it is often desirable to separate effects of different regulators on gene expression, or to identify effects of the same regulator across several systems. here, we focus on the rat brain following stroke or seizures, and demonstrate how the two tasks can be approached simultaneously.


RESULTS
we applied svd to time-series gene expression datasets from the rat experimental models of stroke and seizures. we demonstrate conservation of two eigensystems, reflecting inflammation and/or apoptosis  and neuronal synaptic activity , between the stroke and seizures. we analyzed cis-regulation of gene expression in the subspaces of the conserved eigensystems. bayesian networks analysis was performed separately for either experimental model, with cross-system validation of the highest-ranking features. in this way, we correctly re-discovered the role of ap <dig> in the regulation of apoptosis, and the involvement of creb and egr in the regulation of synaptic activity-related genes.

we identified a novel antagonistic effect of the motif recognized by the nuclear matrix attachment region-binding protein satb <dig> on ap1-driven transcriptional activation, suggesting a link between chromatin loop structure and gene activation by ap <dig>  the effects of motifs binding satb <dig> and creb on gene expression in brain conform to the assumption of the linear response model of gene regulation. our data also suggest that numerous enhancers of neuronal-specific genes are important for their responsiveness to the synaptic activity.


CONCLUSIONS
eigensystems conserved between stroke and seizures separate effects of inflammation/apoptosis and neuronal synaptic activity, exerted by different transcription factors, on gene expression in rat brain.
