BACKGROUND
a large collection of sequenced mycobacteriophages capable of infecting a single host strain of mycobacterium smegmatis shows considerable genomic diversity with dozens of distinctive types  and extensive variation within those sharing evident nucleotide sequence similarity. here we profiled the mycobacterial components of a large composting system at the são paulo zoo.


RESULTS
we isolated and sequenced eight mycobacteriophages using mycobacterium smegmatis mc <dig> as a host. none of these eight phages infected any of mycobacterial strains isolated from the same materials. the phage isolates span considerable genomic diversity, including two phages  related to subcluster a <dig> phages, two cluster b phages , three subcluster f <dig> phages , and madruga, a relative of phage patience with which it constitutes the new cluster u. interestingly, the two subcluster a <dig> phages and the three subcluster f <dig> phages have genomic relationships indicating relatively recent evolution within a geographically isolated niche in the composting system.


CONCLUSIONS
we predict that composting systems such as those used to obtain these mycobacteriophages will be a rich source for the isolation of additional phages that will expand our view of bacteriophage diversity and evolution.
