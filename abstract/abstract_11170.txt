BACKGROUND
the intestinal tract harbours a complex and diverse microbial population that is important for health, yet has been poorly described in many species. this study explored the fecal microbiota of semi-free-ranging wood bison .


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> 16s rrna  sequences from  <dig> bison were evaluated. catchall analysis of richness predicted a mean of  <dig> species per sample . diversity was high, with an average inverse simpsonâ€™s index of  <dig>  . twenty-one different phyla were identified; however, only firmicutes and proteobacteria, actinobacteria accounted for >1% of sequences. two distinct population clusters  were evident based on both community membership and population structure. group a had a significantly lower relative abundance of actinobacteria , chloroflexi , gemmatimonadetes  and proteobacteria  and a greater relative abundance of firmicutes  than group b. within group b, alphaproteobacteria was the most common class of proteobacteria , while caulobacteraceae , pseudomonadaceae , hyphomicrobiaceae , alcaligenaceae  and xanthomonadaceae  were the most abundant families.

the twenty  most abundant genera accounted for 71% of sequences. no operational taxon units  were found in all samples at a relative abundance of 1% or greater. one otu  was present at 1% or more in all group a samples, with two other clostridium cluster xi otus in 18/ <dig>  samples. no otus were found at that abundance in all group b sample, but an unclassified lachnospiraceae was present in 20/ <dig>  and clostridium cluster xi and brevundimonas were found in  <dig>  samples.


CONCLUSIONS
the fecal microbiota of wood bison is rich and diverse. the presence of two distinct populations not associated with housing, age or gender suggest that enterotypes, distinctly different microbial population compositions that can achieve the same ultimate function, might be present in bison, as has been suggested in humans.
