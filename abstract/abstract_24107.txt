BACKGROUND
high density linkage maps are essential for comparative analysis of synteny, fine mapping of quantitative trait loci , searching for candidate genes and facilitating genome sequence assembly. however, in most foodfish species, marker density is still low. we previously reported a first generation linkage map with  <dig> dna markers and its application to preliminarily map qtl for growth traits in asian seabass . here, we report a high-resolution linkage map with  <dig> microsatellites and snps, comparative analysis of synteny, fine-mapping of qtl and the identification of potential candidate genes for growth traits.


RESULTS
a second generation linkage map of asian seabass was developed with  <dig> microsatellite and snp markers. the map spanned a genetic length of  <dig>  cm, with an average intermarker distance of  <dig>  cm or  <dig>  mb. this high density map allowed for comparison of the map with tetraodon nigroviridis genome, which revealed  <dig> synteny regions between the two species. moreover, by employing this map we refined qtl to regions of  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm  in linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig> in a population containing  <dig> progeny; potential candidate genes for growth traits in qtl regions were further identified using comparative genome analysis, whose effects on growth traits were investigated. interestingly, a qtl cluster at lca <dig> underlying growth traits of asian seabass showed similarity to the cathepsin d gene of human, which is related to cancer and alzheimer's disease.


CONCLUSIONS
we constructed a high resolution linkage map, carried out comparative mapping, refined the positions of qtl, identified candidate genes for growth traits and analyzed their effects on growth. our study developed a framework that will be indispensable for further identification of genes and analysis of molecular variation within the refined qtl to enhance understanding of the molecular basis of growth and speed up genetic improvement of growth performance, and it also provides critical resource for future genome sequence assembly and comparative genomics studies on the evolution of fish genomes.
