BACKGROUND
establishing genomic resources for closely related species will provide comparative insights that are crucial for understanding diversity and variability at multiple levels of biological organization. we developed ests for mexican axolotl  and eastern tiger salamander , species with deep and diverse research histories.


RESULTS
approximately  <dig>  quality cdna sequences were isolated for these species from various tissues, including regenerating limb and tail. these sequences and an existing set of  <dig>  cdna sequences for a. mexicanum were processed to yield  <dig>  and  <dig>  high quality ests for a. mexicanum and a. t. tigrinum, respectively. because the a. t. tigrinum ests were obtained primarily from a normalized library, an approximately equal number of contigs were obtained for each species, with  <dig>  unique contigs identified overall. the  <dig>  contigs that showed significant similarity to sequences from the human refseq database reflected a diverse array of molecular functions and biological processes, with many corresponding to genes expressed during spinal cord injury in rat and fin regeneration in zebrafish. to demonstrate the utility of these est resources, we searched databases to identify probes for regeneration research, characterized intra- and interspecific nucleotide polymorphism, saturated a human â€“ ambystoma synteny group with marker loci, and extended pcr primer sets designed for a. mexicanum / a. t. tigrinum orthologues to a related tiger salamander species.


CONCLUSIONS
our study highlights the value of developing resources in traditional model systems where the likelihood of information transfer to multiple, closely related taxa is high, thus simultaneously enabling both laboratory and natural history research.
