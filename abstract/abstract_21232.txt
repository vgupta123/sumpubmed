BACKGROUND
single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors  play important roles in controlling trichome patterning in arabidopsis. it was proposed that single-repeat mybs negatively regulate trichome formation by competing with glabra <dig>  for binding glabra3/enhancer of glabra <dig> , thus inhibiting the formation of activator complex ttg1-gl3/egl3-gl <dig> that is required for the activation of glabra <dig> , whose product is a positive regulator of trichome formation. previously we identified a novel single-repeat myb transcription factor, trichomeless <dig> , which negatively regulates trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicels by directly suppressing the expression of gl <dig> 


RESULTS
we analyzed here the role of trichomeless <dig> , a previously-uncharacterized single-repeat myb transcription factor in trichome patterning in arabidopsis. we showed that tcl <dig> is closely related to tcl <dig>  and like tcl <dig> and other single-repeat mybs, tcl <dig> interacts with gl <dig>  overexpression of tcl <dig> conferred glabrous phenotype while knockdown of tcl <dig> via rnai induced ectopic trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicels, a phenotype that was previously observed in tcl <dig> mutants. these results suggested that tcl <dig> may have overlapping function with tcl <dig> in controlling trichome formation on inflorescences. on the other hand, although the transcription of tcl <dig>  like tcl <dig>  is not controlled by the activator complex formed by gl <dig> and gl <dig>  and tcl <dig> and tcl <dig> proteins are more than 80% identical at the amino acid level, the expression of tcl <dig> under the control of tcl <dig> promoter only partially recovered the mutant phenotype of tcl <dig>  implying that tcl <dig> and tcl <dig> are not fully functional equivalent.


CONCLUSIONS
tcl <dig> function redundantly with tcl <dig> in controlling trichome formation on inflorescences, but they are not fully functional equivalent. transcription of tcl <dig> is not controlled by activator complex formed by gl <dig> and gl <dig>  but mir <dig> controlled squamosa promoter binding protein like  transcription factors. however, spls might require co-activators to regulate the expression of their target genes, including tcl <dig>  try and possibly, tcl <dig>
