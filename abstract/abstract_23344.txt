BACKGROUND
next-generation sequencing of transposon-genome junctions from a saturated bacterial mutant library  is a powerful tool that permits genome-wide determination of the contribution of genes to fitness of the organism under a wide range of experimental conditions. we report development, testing, and results from a tn-seq system for use in streptococcus agalactiae , an important cause of neonatal sepsis.

methods
our method uses a himar <dig> mini-transposon that inserts at genomic ta dinucleotide sites, delivered to gbs on a temperature-sensitive plasmid that is subsequently cured from the bacterial population. in order to establish the gbs essential genome, we performed tn-seq on dna collected from three independent mutant libraries—with at least  <dig>  mutants per library—at serial  <dig> h time points after outgrowth in rich media.


RESULTS
after statistical analysis of transposon insertion density and distribution, we identified  <dig>  % of genes as essential and  <dig>  % as critical, with high levels of reproducibility. essential and critical genes are enriched for fundamental cellular housekeeping functions, such as acyl-trna biosynthesis, nucleotide metabolism, and glycolysis. we further validated our system by comparing fitness assignments of homologous genes in gbs and a close bacterial relative, streptococcus pyogenes, which demonstrated 93 % concordance. finally, we used our fitness assignments to identify signal transduction pathway components predicted to be essential or critical in gbs.


CONCLUSIONS
we believe that our baseline fitness assignments will be a valuable tool for gbs researchers and that our system has the potential to reveal key pathogenesis gene networks and potential therapeutic/preventative targets.
