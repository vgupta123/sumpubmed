BACKGROUND
standard numbering schemes for families of homologous proteins allow for the unambiguous identification of functionally and structurally relevant residues, to communicate results on mutations, and to systematically analyse sequence-function relationships in protein families. standard numbering schemes have been successfully implemented for several protein families, including lactamases and antibodies, whereas a numbering scheme for the structural family of thiamine-diphosphate  -dependent decarboxylases, a large subfamily of the class of thdp-dependent enzymes encompassing pyruvate-, benzoylformate-, 2-oxo acid-, indolpyruvate- and phenylpyruvate decarboxylases, benzaldehyde lyase, acetohydroxyacid synthases and 2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate synthase  is still missing.

despite a high structural similarity between the members of the thdp-dependent decarboxylases, their sequences are diverse and make a pairwise sequence comparison of protein family members difficult.


RESULTS
we developed and validated a standard numbering scheme for the family of thdp-dependent decarboxylases. a profile hidden markov model  was created using a set of representative sequences from the family of thdp-dependent decarboxylases. the pyruvate decarboxylase from s. cerevisiae  was chosen as a reference because it is a well characterized enzyme. the crystal structure with the pdb identifier 2vk <dig> encompasses the structure of the scpdc mutant e477q, the cofactors thdp and mg2+ as well as the substrate analogue -2-hydroxypropanoic acid. the absolute numbering of this reference sequence was transferred to all members of the thdp-dependent decarboxylase protein family. subsequently, the numbering scheme was integrated into the already established thiamine-diphosphate dependent enzyme engineering database  and was used to systematically analyze functionally and structurally relevant positions in the superfamily of thdp-dependent decarboxylases.


CONCLUSIONS
the numbering scheme serves as a tool for the reliable sequence alignment of thdp-dependent decarboxylases and the unambiguous identification and communication of corresponding positions. thus, it is the basis for the systematic and automated analysis of sequence-encoded properties such as structural and functional relevance of amino acid positions, because the analysis of conserved positions, the identification of correlated mutations and the determination of subfamily specific amino acid distributions depend on reliable multisequence alignments and the unambiguous identification of the alignment columns. the method is reliable and robust and can easily be adapted to further protein families.
