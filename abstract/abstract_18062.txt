BACKGROUND
ybx3/zonab/csda is an epithelial-specific transcription factor acting in the density-based switch between proliferation and differentiation. our laboratory reported overexpression of ybx <dig> in clear cell renal cell arcinoma , as part of a wide study of ybx <dig> regulation in vitro and in vivo. the preliminary data was limited to  <dig> cases, of which only  <dig> could be compared to paired normal tissue, and beta-actin was used as sole reference to normalize gene expression. we thus decided to re-evaluate ybx <dig> expression by real-time-pcr in a larger panel of ccrcc samples, and their paired healthy tissue, with special attention on experimental biases such as inter-individual variations, primer specificity, and reference gene for normalization.


RESULTS
gene expression was measured by rt-qpcr in  <dig> ccrcc samples, each compared to corresponding healthy tissue to minimize inter-individual variations. eight potential housekeeping genes were evaluated for expression level and stability among the 16-paired samples. among tested housekeeping genes, ppia and rps <dig>  especially in combination, proved best suitable to normalize gene expression in ccrcc tissues as compared to classical reference genes such as beta-actin, gapdh, 18s or b2m. using this pair as reference, ybx <dig> expression level among a collection of  <dig> ccrcc tumors was not significantly increased as compared to normal adjacent tissues. however, stratification according to fuhrman grade disclosed higher ybx <dig> expression levels in low-grade tumors and lower in high-grade tumors. immunoperoxidase confirmed homogeneous nuclear staining for ybx <dig> in low-grade but revealed nuclear heterogeneity in high-grade tumors.


CONCLUSIONS
this paper underlines that special attention to reference gene products in the design of real-time pcr analysis of tumoral tissue is crucial to avoid misleading conclusions.

furthermore, we found that global ybx3/zonab/csda mrna expression level may be considered within a “signature” of rcc grading.
