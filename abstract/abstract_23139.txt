BACKGROUND
the rice transcription factor wrky <dig> plays a crucial role in salicylic acid /benzothiadiazole -induced disease resistance. its knockdown severely reduces bth-induced resistance to the fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae and the bacterial pathogen xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae . conversely, overexpression of wrky <dig> induces extremely strong resistance to both of these pathogens. to elucidate the molecular basis of wrky45-dependent disease resistance, we analyzed wrky45-regulated gene expression using rice transformants and a transient gene expression system.


RESULTS
we conducted a microarray analysis using wrky45-knockdown  rice plants, and identified wrky45-dependent genes among the bth-responsive genes. the bth-responsiveness of  <dig> genes was dependent on wrky <dig>  among these,  <dig> genes , many of which encoded pr proteins and proteins associated with secondary metabolism, were upregulated by bth. only a small portion of these genes overlapped with those regulated by osnpr1/nh <dig>  supporting the idea that the rice sa pathway branches into wrky45- regulated and osnpr1/nh1-regulated subpathways. dexamethazone-induced expression of myc-tagged wrky <dig> in rice immediately upregulated transcription of endogenous wrky <dig> and genes encoding the transcription factors wrky <dig>  osnac <dig>  and hsf <dig>  all of which have been reported to have defense-related functions. this was followed by upregulation of defense genes encoding pr proteins and secondary metabolic enzymes. many of these genes were also induced after m. oryzae infection. their temporal transcription patterns were consistent with those after dexamethazone-induced wrky <dig> expression. in a transient expression system consisting of particle bombardment of rice coleoptiles, wrky <dig> acted as an effector to trans-activate reporter genes in which the luciferase coding sequence was fused to upstream and intragenic sequences of wrky <dig> and osnac <dig>  trans-activation of transcription occurred through a w-box-containing sequence upstream of osnac <dig> and mutations in the w-boxes abolished the trans-activation.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest a role of wrky <dig> in bth-induced disease resistance as a master regulator of the transcriptional cascade regulating defense responses in one of two branches in the rice sa pathway.
