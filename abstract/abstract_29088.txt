BACKGROUND
the transcription factor  forkhead box p <dig>  is constitutively expressed at high levels in naturally occurring cd4+cd25+ regulatory t cells . it is not only the most accepted marker for that cell population but is also considered lineage determinative. chromatin immunoprecipitation  of tfs in combination with genomic tiling microarray analysis  has been shown to be an appropriate tool for identifying foxp <dig> transcription factor binding sites  on a genome-wide scale. in combination with microarray expression analysis, the chip-on-chip technique allows identification of direct foxp <dig> target genes.


RESULTS
chip-on-chip analysis of the human foxp <dig> expressed in resting and pma/ionomycinâ€“stimulated jurkat t cells revealed several thousand putative foxp <dig> binding sites and demonstrated the importance of intronic regions for foxp <dig> binding. the analysis of expression data showed that the stimulation-dependent down-regulation of il- <dig> was correlated with direct foxp <dig> binding in the il- <dig> promoter region. this association was confirmed by real-time pcr analysis of chip-dna. the corresponding chip-region also contained a matching foxp <dig> consensus sequence.


CONCLUSIONS
knowledge of the general distribution patterns of foxp <dig> tfbss in the human genome under resting and activated conditions will contribute to a better understanding of this tf and its influence on direct target genes, as well as its importance for the phenotype and function of tregs. moreover, foxp3-dependent repression of th17-related il- <dig> may be relevant to an understanding of the phenomenon of treg/th <dig> cell plasticity.
