BACKGROUND
macrophage migration inhibitory factor  is a cytokine that shares many activities with other pro-inflammatory cytokines in primary glomerulonephritis . this study assesses the influence of immunosuppressive treatment on serum and urine mif in patients with proliferative  and non-proliferative  glomerulonephritis, and evaluates the potential of mif in predicting outcomes.

methods
eighty-four patients  with primary gn were included. urinary excretion of mif  was measured both pre- and post-treatment with combined steroids and cyclophosphamide. after a 12-month follow-up, the patients were retrospectively divided into four subgroups: responders of proliferative gn , non-responders of proliferative gn , responders of non-proliferative gn  and non-responders of non-proliferative gn .


RESULTS
the median pre-treatment urinary mif values were higher in pgn than in npgn . the highest pre-treatment urinary excretion of mif was observed in nr-pgn , which was significantly higher than other subgroups . the treatment significantly reduced mif urinary excretion only in r-pgn . in nr-pgn, pre-  and post-treatment mean mif excretion  exceeded the calculated cut off value .


CONCLUSIONS
mif urinary excretion appears to be a prognostic marker of therapy outcomes only in proliferative glomerulonephritis, in which lower urinary mif may be linked with good prognosis, whereas a higher mif urinary excretion value was a marker of unfavorable therapy outcomes. in non-responders, urinary mif measurements may help to reconsider the choice of the immunosuppressive regimen at early stages of the treatment and act as an impulse to search for new therapeutic strategies.
