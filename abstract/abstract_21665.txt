BACKGROUND
protein aggregation plays important roles in several neurodegenerative disorders. for instance, insoluble aggregates of phosphorylated tau and of aβ peptides are cornerstones in the pathology of alzheimer's disease. soluble protein aggregates are therefore potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for their cognate disorders. detection of the aggregated species requires sensitive tools that efficiently discriminate them from monomers of the same proteins. here we have established a proximity ligation assay  for specific and sensitive detection of aβ protofibrils via simultaneous recognition of three identical determinants present in the aggregates. pla is a versatile technology in which the requirement for multiple target recognitions is combined with the ability to translate signals from detected target molecules to amplifiable dna strands, providing very high specificity and sensitivity.


RESULTS
for specific detection of aβ protofibrils we have used a monoclonal antibody, mab <dig>  selective for aβ protofibrils in a modified pla, where the same monoclonal antibody was used for the three classes of affinity reagents required in the assay. these reagents were used for detection of soluble aβ aggregates in solid-phase reactions, allowing detection of just  <dig>  pg/ml aβ protofibrils, and with a dynamic range greater than six orders of magnitude. compared to a sandwich elisa setup of the same antibody the pla increases the sensitivity of the aβ protofibril detection by up to 25-fold. the assay was used to measure soluble aβ aggregates in brain homogenates from mice transgenic for a human allele predisposing to aβ aggregation.


CONCLUSIONS
the proximity ligation assay is a versatile analytical technology for proteins, which can provide highly sensitive and specific detection of aβ aggregates - and by implication other protein aggregates of relevance in alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.
