BACKGROUND
the atlantic salmon is a species of commercial and ecological significance. like other salmonids, the species displays residual tetrasomy and a large difference in recombination rate between sexes. linkage maps with full genome coverage, containing both type i and type ii markers, are needed for progress in genomics. furthermore, it is important to estimate levels of linkage disequilibrium  in the species. in this study, we developed several hundred single nucleotide polymorphism  markers for the atlantic salmon, and constructed male and female linkage maps containing snp and microsatellite markers. we also investigated further the distribution of male and female recombination events across the genome, and estimated levels of ld between pairs of markers.


RESULTS
the male map had  <dig> linkage groups and was  <dig> cm long. the female map had  <dig> linkage groups as was  <dig> cm long. in total, the maps contained  <dig> microsatellite markers and  <dig> snps located within genes, most of which were successfully annotated. the ratio of male to female recombination events was either close to zero or very large, indicating that there is little overlap between regions in which male and female crossovers occur. the female map is likely to have close to full genome coverage, while the majority of male linkage groups probably lack markers in telomeric regions where male recombination events occur. levels of r <dig> increased with decreasing inter-marker distance in a bimodal fashion; increasing slowly from ~ <dig> cm, and more rapidly more from ~ <dig> cm. long-ranging ld may be consequence of recent admixture in the population, the population being a 'synthetic' breeding population with contributions from several distinct rivers. levels of r <dig> dropped to half its maximum value  within  <dig> cm, and were higher than  <dig>  above baseline for unlinked markers  at inter-marker distances less than  <dig> cm.


CONCLUSIONS
the linkage map presented here is an important resource for genetic, comparative, and physical mapping of the atlantic salmon. the female map is likely to have a map coverage that is not far from complete, whereas the male map length is likely to be significantly shorter than the true map, due to suboptimal marker coverage in the apparently small physical regions where male crossovers occur. 'useful ld' was found at inter-marker distances less than  <dig> cm.
