BACKGROUND
plant biomass, the most abundant natural material on earth, represents a vast source of food and energy in nature. as the main component of plant biomass, xylan is a complex polysaccharide comprising a linear β-linked backbone of xylosyl residues substituted by acetyl, arabinosyl, glucuronysyl and 4-o-methylglucuronycyl residues.


RESULTS
aspergillus fumigatus z <dig> is an efficient plant biomass depolymerization fungus. in this study, its crude xylanolytic enzymes were characterized and identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis . the optimal temperature for the crude xylanases was close to 60 °c, the highest xylanase activity was achieved at ph ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  and the crude xylanases also showed a very broad region of ph  stability. the maximal xylanase activity of  <dig>  u · ml− <dig> was observed in the fourth day of cultivation at 50 °c and 150 rpm with 2 % xylan as the sole carbon source. zymogram analysis indicated that there were more than seven secreted proteins with xylanase activity. in the crude enzyme, two major endoxylanases, five cellulases and several associated enzymes were identified to be involved in the hydrolysis of polysaccharides. of the total  <dig> xylanase genes in the z <dig> genome,  <dig> were observed using q-pcr to be induced by xylan, one of which, an endo- <dig> -β-xylanase with a low secretion level, was also expressed and characterized. the final hydrolysis products of xylan by crude enzyme mainly consisted of xylobiose.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the depolymerization of xylan by z <dig> and will help to design enzymatic strategies for plant biomass utilization.
