BACKGROUND
the ns <dig> protein of avian influenza virus  is an important virulent factor of aiv. it has been shown to counteract host type i interferon response, to mediate host cell apoptosis, and to regulate the process of protein synthesis. the identification of aiv epitopes on ns <dig> protein is important for understanding influenza virus pathogenesis.


RESULTS
in this paper, we describe the generation, identification, and epitope mapping of a ns <dig> protein-specific monoclonal antibody  d <dig>  first, to induce the production of mabs, balb/c mice were immunized with a purified recombinant ns <dig> expressed in e. coli. the spleen cells from the immunized mice were fused with myeloma cells sp2/ <dig>  and through screening via indirect elisas, a mab, named d <dig>  was identified. western blot assay results showed that mab d <dig> reacted strongly with the recombinant ns <dig>  confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that this mab also reacts with ns <dig> expressed in 293t cells that had been transfected with eukaryotic recombinant plasmids. results from screening a phage display random 7-mer peptide library with mab d <dig> demonstrated that it recognizes phages displaying peptides with the consensus peptide wnlntv--vs, which closely matches the 182wndntvrvs <dig> of aiv ns <dig>  further identification of the displayed epitope was performed with a set of truncated polypeptides expressed as glutathione s-transferase fusion proteins, and the motif 182wndnt <dig> was defined as the minimal unit of the linear b cell epitope recognized by mab d <dig> in western blot assays. moreover, homology analysis showed that this epitope is a conserved motif among aiv.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified a conserved linear epitope, wndnt, on the aiv ns <dig> protein that is recognized by mab d <dig>  this mab and its epitope may facilitate future studies on ns <dig> function and aid the development of new diagnostic methods for aiv detection.
