BACKGROUND
mollusca is the second largest phylum in nature. the shell of molluscs is a remarkable example of a natural composite biomaterial. biomineralization and how it affects mollusks is a popular research topic. the bmp- <dig> signaling pathway plays a canonical role in biomineralization. smad <dig> is an intracellular transmitter in the bmp signaling pathway in mammals, and some genomic data show smad4’s involvment in bmp signaling in invertbrates, but whether smad <dig> plays a conservative role in pearl oyster, pinctada fucata, still need to be tested.


RESULTS
in this study, we identified a smad <dig> gene  in pearl oyster pinctada fucata. bioinformatics analysis of pfsmad <dig> showed high identity with its orthologs. pfsmad <dig> was located in the cytoplasm in immunofluorescence assays and analyses of pfsmad <dig> mrna in tissues and developmental stages showed high expression in ovaries and d-shaped larvae. an rna interference experiment, performed by pfsmad <dig> double-stranded rna  injection, demonstrated inhibition not only of nacre growth but also organic sheet formation with a decrease in pfsmad <dig> expression. a knockdown experiment using pfbmp <dig> dsrna showed decreased pfbmp <dig> and pfsmad <dig> mrna and irregular crystallization of the nacreous layer using scanning electron microscopy. in co-transfection experiments, pfbmp2-transactivated reporter constructs contained pfsmad <dig> promoter sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that pfsmad <dig> plays a role in biomineralization and can transduce bmp signals in p. fucata. our data provides important clues about the molecular mechanisms that regulate biomineralization in pearl oyster.
