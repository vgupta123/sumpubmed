BACKGROUND
in recent years, several new hypotheses on phylogenetic relations among arthropods have been proposed on the basis of dna sequences. one of the challenged hypotheses is the monophyly of hexapods. this discussion originated from analyses based on mitochondrial dna datasets that, due to an unusual positioning of collembola, suggested that the hexapod body plan evolved at least twice. here, we re-evaluate the position of collembola using ribosomal protein gene sequences.


RESULTS
in total  <dig> ribosomal proteins were obtained for the collembolan folsomia candida. these  <dig> sequences were aligned with sequence data on  <dig> other ecdysozoans. each ribosomal protein gene was available for 25% to 86% of the taxa. however, the total sequence information was unequally distributed over the taxa and ranged between 4% and 100%. a concatenated dataset was constructed , of which ~66% of the positions were filled. phylogenetic tree reconstructions, using maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, and bayesian methods, resulted in a topology that supports monophyly of hexapoda.


CONCLUSIONS
although ribosomal proteins in general may not evolve independently, they once more appear highly valuable for phylogenetic reconstruction. our analyses clearly suggest that hexapoda is monophyletic. this underpins the inconsistency between nuclear and mitochondrial datasets when analyzing pancrustacean relationships. caution is needed when applying mitochondrial markers in deep phylogeny.
