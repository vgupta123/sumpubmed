BACKGROUND
we investigated the feeding ecology and habitat use of  <dig> harbour porpoises by-caught in  <dig> localities along the scandinavian coast from the north sea to the barents sea using time-integrative markers: stable isotopes  and trace elements , in relation to habitat characteristics  and geographic position .


RESULTS
among the trace elements analysed, only cd, with an oceanic specific food origin, was found to be useful as an ecological tracer. all other trace elements studied were not useful, most likely because of physiological regulation and/or few specific sources in the food web. the δ13c, δ15n signatures and cd levels were highly correlated with each other, as well as with local bathymetry and geographic position . variation in the isotopic ratios indicated a shift in harbour porpoise's feeding habits from pelagic prey species in deep northern waters to more coastal and/or demersal prey in the relatively shallow north sea and skagerrak waters. this result is consistent with stomach content analyses found in the literature. this shift was associated with a northward cd-enrichment which provides further support to the cd 'anomaly' previously reported in polar waters and suggests that porpoises in deep northern waters include cd-contaminated prey in their diet, such as oceanic cephalopods.


CONCLUSIONS
as stable isotopes and cd provide information in the medium and the long term respectively, the spatial variation found, shows that harbour porpoises experience different ecological regimes during the year along the scandinavian coasts, adapting their feeding habits to local oceanographic conditions, without performing extensive migration.
