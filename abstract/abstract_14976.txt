BACKGROUND
traditional gene replacement procedures are still time-consuming. they usually necessitate cloning of the gene to be mutated, insertional inactivation of the gene with an antibiotic resistance cassette and exchange of the plasmid-borne mutant allele with the bacterial chromosome. pcr and recombinational technologies can be exploited to substantially accelerate virtually all steps involved in the gene replacement process.


RESULTS
we describe a method for rapid generation of unmarked p. aeruginosa deletion mutants. three partially overlapping dna fragments are amplified and then spliced together in vitro by overlap extension pcr. the resulting dna fragment is cloned in vitro into the gateway vector pdonr <dig> and then recombined into the gateway-compatible gene replacement vector pex18apgw. the plasmid-borne deletions are next transferred to the p. aeruginosa chromosome by homologous recombination. unmarked deletion mutants are finally obtained by flp-mediated excision of the antibiotic resistance marker. the method was applied to deletion of  <dig> p. aeruginosa genes encoding transcriptional regulators of the gntr family.


CONCLUSIONS
while maintaining the key features of traditional gene replacement procedures, for example, suicide delivery vectors, antibiotic resistance selection and sucrose counterselection, the method described here is considerably faster due to streamlining of some of the key steps involved in the process, especially plasmid-borne mutant allele construction and its transfer into the target host. with appropriate modifications, the method should be applicable to other bacteria.
