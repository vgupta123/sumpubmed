BACKGROUND
escherichia coli strain el <dig> contains chromosomally integrated phage lambda red recombinase genes enabling this strain to be used for modifying the sequence of resident clones via recombineering. bac and fosmid clones are highly suitable for modification by recombineering but, because they are present at low  copies per cell, the dna is difficult to isolate in high yield and purity. to overcome this limitation vectors, e.g. pcc1fos, have been constructed that contain the additional replication origin, oriv, which permits copy-number to be induced transiently when propagated in a suitable host strain, e.g. epi <dig>  that supplies the cognate trans-replication protein trfa. previously, we used el <dig> and epi <dig> sequentially to recombineer oriv-equipped fosmid genomic clones and, subsequently, to induce copy-number of the resulting recombinant clone. to eliminate these intervening dna isolation and transformation steps we retrofitted el <dig> with a pbad-driven trfa gene generating strain mw <dig> that supports, independently, both recombineering and copy-number induction.


RESULTS
the pbad-driven copy of cre in el <dig> was replaced seamlessly with a copy of trfa, pcr-amplified from epi <dig> chromosomal dna, to generate mw <dig>  this new strain has been used to both generate, via recombineering, a number of reporter gene fusions directly from pcc1fos-based caenorhabditis elegans genomic clones and to transiently induce copy-number of fosmid and bac clones prior to dna preparation.


CONCLUSIONS
by retrofitting el <dig>  an established 'recombineering' e. coli strain, with a tightly regulated copy of trfa we have produced a new strain, mw <dig>  which combines recombineering capacity with the useful ability to transiently induce copy-number of oriv-equipped clones. by coupling these two steps in a single strain, use of mw <dig> will enable the more rapid recombineering-mediated production of recombinant clones in the yield and quality necessary for many downstream purposes.
