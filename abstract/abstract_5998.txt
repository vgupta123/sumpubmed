BACKGROUND
mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis  causes the chronic enteritis called paratuberculosis mainly in cattle, sheep and goats. evidences that point out an association between map and crohn's disease in humans are increasing. strain differentiation among map isolates has proved to be difficult and has limited the study of the molecular epidemiology of paratuberculosis. in order to asses the usefulness of the pcr based short sequence repeat  analysis of locus  <dig> and locus  <dig> in the epidemiological tracing of paratuberculosis strains we here compare for the first time the results of ssr and snabi-spei pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  typing methods in a set of  <dig> map isolates from different hosts .


RESULTS
a total of nineteen different multi-locus ssr  types were identified amongst the  <dig> isolates compared to the  <dig> multiplex profiles differentiated by the snabi-spei pfge. ssr type 7_ <dig> was the predominant genotype , but combined with pfge results the abundance of the most prevalent genotype  dropped down to  <dig> %. ssr types 7_ <dig> and 14_ <dig> were significantly spread amongst isolates recovered from small ruminants. the comparison of ssr1_ssr <dig> and snabi-spei pfge typing of these isolates has shown that both methods perform at similar discriminatory level. these were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively for ssr and pfge as indicated simpson's index of diversity, and  <dig>  when calculated for combined ssr and pfge genotypes. overall, ssr1_ssr <dig> analysis seemed to detect higher levels of within-farm strain diversity and seemed to give higher year-related information. combination of both typing methods revealed  <dig> multi-type farms out of the  <dig> bovine farms studied with more than one isolate.


CONCLUSIONS
the particular ssr and pfge typing approaches described here are in general agreement but they showed some discrepancies that might reflect differing evolutionary processes of map strains. both methods are able to reciprocally complement their results and neither should be replaced with the other if sufficient material and time is available. overall, the results of our comparative analyses suggest that, based on current methodologies available, a combined approach that includes ssr and pfge seems to provide the highest level of discrimination for map strain typing with meaningful epidemiological information.
