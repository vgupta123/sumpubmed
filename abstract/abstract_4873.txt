BACKGROUND
pathophysiological evidence suggests an involvement of fronto-striatal circuits in tourette syndrome . to identify ts related abnormalities in gray and white matter we used optimized voxel-based morphometry  and magnetization transfer imaging  which are more sensitive to tissue alterations than conventional mri and provide a quantitative measure of macrostructural integrity.

methods
volumetric high-resolution anatomical t1-weighted mri and mti were acquired in  <dig> adult, unmedicated male ts patients without co-morbidities and  <dig> age- and sex-matched controls on a  <dig>  tesla neuro-optimized ge scanner. images were pre-processed and analyzed using an optimized version of vbm in spm <dig> 


RESULTS
using vbm, ts patients showed significant decreases in gray matter volumes in prefrontal areas, the anterior cingulate gyrus, sensorimotor areas, left caudate nucleus and left postcentral gyrus. decreases in white matter volumes were detected in the right inferior frontal gyrus, the left superior frontal gyrus and the anterior corpus callosum. increases were found in the left middle frontal gyrus and left sensorimotor areas. in mti, white matter reductions were seen in the right medial frontal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally and the right cingulate gyrus. tic severity was negatively correlated with orbitofrontal structures, the right cingulate gyrus and parts of the parietal-temporal-occipital association cortex bilaterally.


CONCLUSIONS
our mri in vivo neuropathological findings using two sensitive and unbiased techniques support the hypothesis that alterations in frontostriatal circuitries underlie ts pathology. we suggest that anomalous frontal lobe association and projection fiber bundles cause disinhibition of the cingulate gyrus and abnormal basal ganglia function.
