BACKGROUND
it is important to predict the quality of a protein structural model before its native structure is known. the method that can predict the absolute local quality of individual residues in a single protein model is rare, yet particularly needed for using, ranking and refining protein models.


RESULTS
we developed a machine learning tool  that can predict the distance deviation of each residue in a single protein model. smoq uses support vector machines  with protein sequence and structural features , including amino acid sequence, secondary structures, solvent accessibilities, and residue-residue contacts to make predictions. we also trained a svm model with two new additional features  on  <dig> casp <dig> targets and found that including them can only improve the performance when real deviations between native and model are higher than 5Å. the smoq tool finally released uses the basic feature set trained on  <dig> casp <dig> targets. moreover, smoq implemented a way to convert predicted local quality scores into a global quality score. smoq was tested on the  <dig> casp <dig> single-domain targets. the average difference between the residue-specific distance deviation predicted by our method and the actual distance deviation on the test data is  <dig> Å. the global quality prediction accuracy of the tool is comparable to other good tools on the same benchmark.


CONCLUSIONS
smoq is a useful tool for protein single model quality assessment. its source code and executable are available at: http://sysbio.rnet.missouri.edu/multicom_toolbox/.
