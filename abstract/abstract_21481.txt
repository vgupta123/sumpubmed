BACKGROUND
gpr <dig> is a hybrid g-protein-coupled receptor  activated by two unrelated ligand families, extracellular nucleotides and cysteinyl-leukotrienes , and involved in brain damage and repair. its exploitment as a target for novel neuro-reparative strategies depends on the elucidation of the molecular determinants driving binding of purinergic and leukotrienic ligands. here, we applied docking and molecular dynamics simulations  to analyse the binding and the forced unbinding of two gpr <dig> ligands  receptor and a mutant model, where a basic residue hypothesized to be crucial for nucleotide binding had been mutated  to ile.


RESULTS
md suggested that gpr <dig> nucleotide binding pocket is enclosed between the helical bundle and extracellular loop   <dig>  the driving interaction involves r <dig> and the udp phosphate moiety. to support this hypothesis, steered md experiments showed that the energy required to unbind udp is higher for the wt receptor than for r255i. three potential binding sites for pranlukast where instead found and analysed. in one of its preferential docking conformations, pranlukast tetrazole group is close to r <dig> and phenyl rings are placed into a subpocket highly conserved among gpcrs. pulling forces developed to break polar and aromatic interactions of pranlukast were comparable. no differences between the wt receptor and the r255i receptor were found for the unbinding of pranlukast.


CONCLUSIONS
these data thus suggest that, in contrast to which has been hypothesized for nucleotides, the lack of the r <dig> residue doesn't affect the binding of pranlukast a crucial role for r <dig> in binding of nucleotides to gpr <dig>  aromatic interactions are instead likely to play a predominant role in the recognition of pranlukast, suggesting that two different binding subsites are present on gpr <dig>
