BACKGROUND
prokaryotic translation initiation involves the proper docking, anchoring, and accommodation of mrna to the 30s ribosomal subunit. three initiation factors  and some ribosomal proteins mediate the assembly and activation of the translation initiation complex. although the interaction between shine-dalgarno  sequence and its complementary sequence in the 16s rrna is important in initiation, some genes lacking an sd ribosome binding site  are still well expressed. the objective of this study is to examine the pattern of distribution and diversity of rbs in fully sequenced bacterial genomes. the following three hypotheses were tested: sd motifs are prevalent in bacterial genomes; all previously identified sd motifs are uniformly distributed across prokaryotes; and genes with specific cluster of orthologous gene  functions differ in their use of sd motifs.


RESULTS
data for  <dig>  bacterial genomes, previously generated by prodigal  and currently available at the national center for biotechnology information , were analyzed. of the total genes examined, ~ <dig>  % use an sd rbs, while ~ <dig>  % have no rbs. majority of the genes with the most common sd motifs are distributed in a manner that is representative of their abundance for each cog functional category, while motifs  <dig>  and  <dig>  appear to be predominantly used by genes for information storage and processing, and translation and ribosome biogenesis, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that an sd sequence is not obligatory for translation initiation; instead, other signals, such as the rbs spacer, may have an overarching influence on translation of mrnas. subsequent analyses of the 5′ secondary structure of these mrnas may provide further insight into the translation initiation mechanism.
