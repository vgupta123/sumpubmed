BACKGROUND
the cotton  fiber cell is an important unicellular model for studying cell differentiation. there is evidence suggesting that phosphorylation is a critical post-translational modification involved in regulation of a wide range of cell activities. nevertheless, the sites of phosphorylation in g. hirsutum and their regulatory roles in fiber cell initiation are largely unknown. in this study, we employed a mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to conduct a global and site-specific phosphoproteome profiling between ovules of a fuzzless-lintless  upland cotton  mutant and its isogenic parental wild type  at - <dig> and 0 days post-anthesis .


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> phosphopeptides and  <dig>  phosphorylation sites from  <dig> phosphoproteins were identified by itraq . of these,  <dig> phosphoproteins and  <dig>  phosphorylation sites were identified for the first time after searching the p3db public database using the blast program. among the detected phosphopeptides,  <dig> were differentially expressed between the fl mutant and its wt in ovules at - <dig> and  <dig> dpa. an analysis using the motif-x program uncovered  <dig> phosphorylation motifs,  <dig> of which were unique to cotton. a further metabolic pathway analysis revealed that the differentially phosphorylated proteins were involved in signal transduction, protein modification, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and cell cycle and cell proliferation.


CONCLUSIONS
our phosphoproteomics-based research provides the first global overview of phosphorylation during cotton fiber initiation, and also offers a helpful dataset for elucidation of signaling networks in fiber development of g. hirsutum.
