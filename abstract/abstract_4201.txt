BACKGROUND
human cells depend critically on the signal recognition particle  for the sorting and delivery of their proteins. the srp is a ribonucleoprotein complex which binds to signal sequences of secretory polypeptides as they emerge from the ribosome. among the six proteins of the eukaryotic srp, the largest protein, srp <dig>  is essential for protein targeting and possesses a poorly characterized rna binding domain.


RESULTS
we delineated the minimal region of srp <dig> capable of forming a stable complex with an srp rna fragment. the region encompassed residues  <dig> to  <dig> of the full-length human srp <dig> and contained a lysine-rich cluster  at postions  <dig> to  <dig> as well as a conserved pfam motif with the sequence pdpxrwlpxxer at positions  <dig> to  <dig>  we demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis that both regions participated in the formation of a complex with the rna. in agreement with biochemical data and results from chymotryptic digestion experiments, molecular modeling of srp <dig> implied that the invariant w <dig> was located inside the predicted structure of an rna binding domain. the 11-nucleotide 5e motif contained within the srp rna fragment was shown by comparative electrophoresis on native polyacrylamide gels to conform to an rna kink-turn. the model of the complex suggested that the conserved a <dig> of the k-turn, previously identified as being essential for the binding to srp <dig>  could protrude into a groove of the srp <dig> rna binding domain, similar but not identical to how other k-turn recognizing proteins interact with rna.


CONCLUSIONS
the results from the presented experiments provided insights into the molecular details of a functionally important and structurally interesting rna-protein interaction. a model for how a ligand binding pocket of srp <dig> can accommodate a new rna k-turn in the 5e region of the eukaryotic srp rna is proposed.
