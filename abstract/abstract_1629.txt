BACKGROUND
cotton fibers  are the premier natural fibers for textile production. the two tetraploid species, g. barbadense  and g. hirsutum , differ significantly in their fiber properties, the former having much longer, finer and stronger fibers that are highly prized. a better understanding of the genetics and underlying biological causes of these differences will aid further improvement of cotton quality through breeding and biotechnology. we evaluated an inter-specific gh Ã— gb recombinant inbred line  population for fiber characteristics in  <dig> independent experiments under field and glasshouse conditions. sites were located on  <dig> continents and  <dig> countries and some locations were analyzed over multiple years.


RESULTS
the ril population displayed a large variability for all major fiber traits. qtl analyses were performed on a per-site basis by composite interval mapping. among the  <dig> putative qtls ,  <dig> had a lod exceeding permutation based thresholds. coincidence in qtl location across data sets was assessed for the fiber trait categories strength, elongation, length, length uniformity, fineness/maturity, and color. a meta-analysis of more than a thousand putative qtls was conducted with metaqtl software to integrate qtl data from the ril and  <dig> backcross populations  and to compare them with the literature. although the global level of congruence across experiments and populations was generally moderate, the qtl clustering was possible for  <dig> trait x chromosome combinations  where an effective co-localization of unidirectional  qtls from at least  <dig> different data sets was observed. most consistent meta-clusters were identified for fiber color on chromosomes c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  fineness on c <dig>  and fiber length on c <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
meta-analysis provided a reliable means of integrating phenotypic and genetic mapping data across multiple populations and environments for complex fiber traits. the consistent chromosomal regions contributing to fiber quality traits constitute good candidates for the further dissection of the genetic and genomic factors underlying important fiber characteristics, and for marker-assisted selection.
