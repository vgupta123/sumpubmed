BACKGROUND
up to now, there have been three published versions of a yeast genome-scale metabolic model: iff <dig>  ind <dig> and ill <dig>  all three models, however, lack a detailed description of lipid metabolism and thus are unable to be used as integrated scaffolds for gaining insights into lipid metabolism from multilevel omic measurement technologies . to overcome this limitation, we reconstructed a new version of the saccharomyces cerevisiae genome-scale model, iin <dig> that includes a more rigorous and detailed description of lipid metabolism.


RESULTS
the reconstructed metabolic model comprises  <dig> reactions and  <dig> metabolites. beyond incorporating new reactions involved in lipid metabolism, we also present new biomass equations that improve the predictive power of flux balance analysis simulations. predictions of both growth capability and large scale in silico single gene deletions by iin <dig> were consistent with experimental data. in addition, 13c-labeling experiments validated the new biomass equations and calculated intracellular fluxes. to demonstrate the applicability of iin <dig>  we show that the model can be used as a scaffold to reveal the regulatory importance of lipid metabolism precursors and intermediates that would have been missed in previous models from transcriptome datasets.


CONCLUSIONS
performing integrated analyses using iin <dig> as a network scaffold is shown to be a valuable tool for elucidating the behavior of complex metabolic networks, particularly for identifying regulatory targets in lipid metabolism that can be used for industrial applications or for understanding lipid disease states.
