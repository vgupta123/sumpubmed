BACKGROUND
atlantic cod  reared in sea-cages can experience large variations in temperature, and these have been shown to affect their immune function. we used the new 20k atlantic cod microarray to investigate how a water temperature change which, simulates that seen in newfoundland during the spring-summer  impacted the cod spleen transcriptome response to the intraperitoneal injection of a viral mimic .


RESULTS
the temperature regime alone did not cause any significant increases in plasma cortisol levels and only minor changes in spleen gene transcription. however, it had a considerable impact on the fish spleen transcriptome response to pic . seventeen microarray-identified transcripts were selected for qpcr validation based on immune-relevant functional annotations. fifteen of these transcripts , including dhx <dig>  stat <dig>  irf <dig>  isg <dig>  rsad <dig> and iκbα, were shown by qpcr to be significantly induced by pic.


CONCLUSIONS
the temperature increase appeared to accelerate the spleen immune transcriptome response to pic. we found  <dig> and  <dig> genes differentially expressed between fish injected with pbs vs. pic at 10°c and sampled at 6hpi and 24hpi, respectively. in contrast, there were  <dig> and  <dig> genes differentially expressed between fish injected with pbs vs. pic at 16°c and sampled at 6hpi and 24hpi, respectively. our results indicate that the modulation of mrna expression of genes belonging to the nf-κb and type i interferon signal transduction pathways may play a role in controlling temperature-induced changes in the spleen’s transcript expression response to pic. moreover, interferon effector genes such as isg <dig> and rsad <dig> were differentially expressed between fish injected with pic at 10°c vs. 16°c at 6hpi. these results substantially increase our understanding of the genes and molecular pathways involved in the negative impacts of elevated ambient temperature on fish health, and may also be valuable to our understanding of how accelerated global climate change could impact cold-water marine finfish species.
