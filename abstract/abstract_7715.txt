BACKGROUND
the primary cilium is a solitary organelle important in cellular signaling, that projects from the cell surface of most growth-arrested or post-mitotic cells including neurons in the central nervous system. we hypothesized that primary cilial dysfunction might play a role in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , and as a first step, report on the prevalence of primary cilial markers on cultured motor neurons from the lumbar spinal cord of embryonic wildtype  and transgenic g93a sod <dig> mice, and on motor neurons in situ in the lumbar spinal cord.


RESULTS
at  <dig> days in culture there is no difference in the proportion of g93a sod <dig> and wt motor neurons staining for the cilial marker aciii. however, at  <dig> days there is a large relative drop in the proportion of ciliated g93a sod <dig> motor neurons. in situ, at  <dig> days there was a slight relative drop in the proportion of ciliated motor neurons in g93a sod <dig> mice. at  <dig> days of age there was no change in motor neuron ciliation in wt mice, but there was motor neuron loss and a large reduction in the proportion of surviving motor neurons bearing a primary cilium in g93a sod <dig> mice.


CONCLUSIONS
in primary culture and in situ in g93a sod <dig> mice there is a large reduction in the proportion of motor neurons bearing a primary cilium.
