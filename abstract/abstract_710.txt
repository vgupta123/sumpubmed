BACKGROUND
protein prenylation is a common post-translational modification in metazoans, protozoans, fungi, and plants. this modification, which mediates protein-membrane and protein-protein interactions, is characterized by the covalent attachment of a fifteen-carbon farnesyl or twenty-carbon geranylgeranyl group to the cysteine residue of a carboxyl terminal caax motif. in arabidopsis, era <dig> mutants lacking protein farnesyltransferase exhibit enlarged meristems, supernumerary floral organs, an enhanced response to abscisic acid , and drought tolerance. in contrast, ggb mutants lacking protein geranylgeranyltransferase type  <dig> exhibit subtle changes in aba and auxin responsiveness, but develop normally.


RESULTS
we have expressed recombinant arabidopsis protein farnesyltransferase  and protein geranylgeranyltransferase type  <dig>  in e. coli and characterized purified enzymes with respect to kinetic constants and substrate specificities. our results indicate that, whereas pft exhibits little specificity for the terminal amino acid of the caax motif, pggt <dig> exclusively prenylates caax proteins with a leucine in the terminal position. moreover, we found that different substrates exhibit similar km but different kcat values in the presence of pft and pggt <dig>  indicating that substrate specificities are determined primarily by reactivity rather than binding affinity.


CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here potentially explain the relatively strong phenotype of era <dig> mutants and weak phenotype of ggb mutants. specifically, the substrate specificities of pft and pggt <dig> suggest that pft can compensate for loss of pggt <dig> in ggb mutants more effectively than pggt <dig> can compensate for loss of pft in era <dig> mutants. moreover, our results indicate that pft and pggt <dig> substrate specificities are primarily due to differences in catalysis, rather than differences in substrate binding.
