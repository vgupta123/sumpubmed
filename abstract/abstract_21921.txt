BACKGROUND
receptor-like kinases  belong to a large protein family with over  <dig> members in arabidopsis and over  <dig> in rice. among rlks, the lectin receptor-like kinases  possess a characteristic extracellular carbohydrate-binding lectin domain and play important roles in plant development and innate immunity. there are  <dig> and  <dig> lecrlks in arabidopsis and rice, respectively. however, little is known about lecrlks in perennial woody plants.


RESULTS
here we report the genome-wide analysis of classification, domain architecture and expression of lecrlks in the perennial woody model plant populus. we found that the lecrlk family has expanded in populus to a total of  <dig>  including 180 g-type, 50 l-type and  <dig> c-type lecrlks. expansion of the populus lecrlks  occurred partially through tandem duplication. based on domain architecture and orientation features, we classified ptlecrlks into eight different classes. rna-seq-based transcriptomics analysis revealed diverse expression patterns of ptlecrlk genes among leaves, stems, roots, buds and reproductive tissues and organs.


CONCLUSIONS
this study offers a comprehensive view of lecrlks in the perennial woody model plant populus and provides a foundation for functional characterization of this important family of receptor-like kinases.
