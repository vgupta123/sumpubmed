BACKGROUND
the nonsense-mediated mrna decay  pathway promotes the rapid degradation of mrnas containing premature termination codons . in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the activity of the nmd pathway depends on the recognition of the ptc by the translational machinery. translation termination factors erf <dig>  and erf <dig>  participate not only in the last step of protein synthesis but also in mrna degradation and translation initiation via interaction with such proteins as pab <dig>  upf <dig>  upf <dig> and upf <dig> 


RESULTS
in this work we have used previously isolated sup <dig> mutants of s. cerevisiae to characterize degradation of aberrant mrna in conditions when translation termination is impaired. we have sequenced his7- <dig>  lys9-a <dig> and trp1- <dig> alleles which are frequently used for analysis of nonsense suppression. we have established that sup <dig> nonsense and missense mutations lead to accumulation of his7- <dig> mrna and cyh <dig> pre-mrna. remarkably, deletion of the upf <dig> gene suppresses some sup <dig> phenotypes. in particular, sup45-n upf1Î” double mutants were less temperature sensitive, and more resistant to paromomycin than sup <dig> single mutants. in addition, deletion of either upf <dig> or upf <dig> restored viability of sup45-n double mutants.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first demonstration that sup <dig> mutations do not only change translation fidelity but also acts by causing a change in mrna stability.
