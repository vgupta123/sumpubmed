BACKGROUND
the low luminal ca2+ concentration of mammalian endolymph in the inner ear is required for normal hearing and balance. we recently reported the expression of mrna for a ca2+-absorptive transport system in primary cultures of semicircular canal duct  epithelium.


RESULTS
we now identify this system in native vestibular and cochlear tissues by qrt-pcr, immunoblots and confocal immunolocalization. transcripts were found and quantified for several isoforms of epithelial calcium channels , calcium buffer proteins , sodium-calcium exchangers  and plasma membrane ca2+-atpase  in native sccd, cochlear lateral wall  and stria vascularis  of adult rat as well as ca2+ channels in neonatal sccd. all components were expressed except trpv <dig> in sv and pmca <dig> in sccd.  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig>  significantly up-regulated transcripts of trpv <dig> in sccd, calbindin-d9k in sccd and lw, ncx <dig> in lw, while pmca <dig> in sccd and pmca <dig> in lw were down-regulated. the expression of trpv <dig> relative to trpv <dig> was in the sequence sv > neonatal sccd > adult sccd > lw > primary culture sccd. expression of trpv <dig> protein from primary culture of sccd did not increase significantly when cells were incubated with vitd . immunolocalization showed the distribution of trpv <dig> and trpv <dig>  trpv <dig> was found near the apical membrane of strial marginal cells and both trpv <dig> and trpv <dig> in outer and inner sulcus cells of the cochlea and in the sccd of the vestibular system.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings demonstrate for the first time the expression of a complete ca2+ absorptive system in native cochlear and vestibular tissues. regulation by vitamin d remains equivocal since the results support the regulation of this system at the transcript level but evidence for control of the trpv <dig> channel protein was lacking.
