BACKGROUND
transmembrane  proteins are proteins that span a biological membrane one or more times. as their 3-d structures are hard to determine, experiments focus on identifying their topology , but only a few topologies are known. consequently, various computational tm topology predictors have been developed, but their accuracies are far from perfect. the prediction quality can be improved by applying a consensus approach, which combines results of several predictors to yield a more reliable result.


RESULTS
a novel tm consensus method, named metatm, is proposed in this work. metatm is based on support vector machine models and combines the results of six tm topology predictors and two signal peptide predictors. on a large data set comprising  <dig> sequences of tm proteins with known topologies and  <dig> globular protein sequences it correctly predicts  <dig> % of all topologies.


CONCLUSIONS
combining several tm predictors in a consensus prediction framework improves overall accuracy compared to any of the individual methods. our proposed svm-based system also has higher accuracy than a previous consensus predictor. metatm is made available both as downloadable source code and as das server at
