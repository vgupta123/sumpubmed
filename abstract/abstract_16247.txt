BACKGROUND
recent studies indicate that the g protein-coupled receptor  signaling machinery can serve as a direct target of reactive oxygen species, including nitric oxide  and s-nitrosothiols . to gain a broader view into the way that receptor-dependent g protein activation – an early step in signal transduction – might be affected by rsnos, we have studied several receptors coupling to the gi family of g proteins in their native cellular environment using the powerful functional approach of gtpγs autoradiography with brain cryostat sections in combination with classical g protein activation assays.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that rsnos, like s-nitrosoglutathione  and s-nitrosocysteine , can modulate gpcr signaling via reversible, thiol-sensitive mechanisms probably involving s-nitrosylation. rsnos are capable of very targeted regulation, as they potentiate the signaling of some receptors , inhibit others , but may only marginally affect signaling of others, such as adenosine a <dig>  μ-opioid, and opiate related receptors. amplification of m2/m <dig> muscarinic responses is explained by an accelerated rate of guanine nucleotide exchange, as well as an increased number of high-affinity gtpγs binding sites available for the agonist-activated receptor. gsno amplified human m <dig> receptor signaling also under heterologous expression in cho cells, but the effect diminished with increasing constitutive receptor activity. rsnos markedly inhibited p2y <dig> receptor signaling in native tissues , but failed to affect human p2y <dig> receptor signaling under heterologous expression in cho cells, indicating that the native cellular signaling partners, rather than the p2y <dig> receptor protein, act as a molecular target for this action.


CONCLUSIONS
these in vitro studies show for the first time in a broader general context that rsnos are capable of modulating gpcr signaling in a reversible and highly receptor-specific manner. given that the enzymatic machinery responsible for endogenous no production is located in close proximity with the gpcr signaling complex, especially with that for several receptors whose signaling is shown here to be modulated by exogenous rsnos, our data suggest that gpcr signaling in vivo is likely to be subject to substantial, and highly receptor-specific modulation by no-derived rsnos.
