BACKGROUND
the ntf2-like superfamily is a versatile group of protein domains sharing a common fold. the sequences of these domains are very diverse and they share no common sequence motif. these domains serve a range of different functions within the proteins in which they are found, including both catalytic and non-catalytic versions. clues to the function of protein domains belonging to such a diverse superfamily can be gleaned from analysis of the proteins and organisms in which they are found.


RESULTS
here we describe three protein domains of unknown function found mainly in bacteria: duf <dig>  duf <dig> and duf <dig>  structures of representatives of each of these domains: bt_ <dig> from bacteroides thetaiotaomicron  , cj0202c from campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni serotype o: <dig>  , rumgna_01855) and rumgna_ <dig> from ruminococcus gnavus   have been solved by x-ray crystallography. all three domains are similar in structure and all belong to the ntf2-like superfamily. although the function of these domains remains unknown at present, our analysis enables us to present a hypothesis concerning their role.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis of these three protein domains suggests a potential non-catalytic ligand-binding role. this may regulate the activities of domains with which they are combined in the same polypeptide or via operonic linkages, such as signaling domains , peptidoglycan-processing hydrolases  or nucleic acid binding domains .
