BACKGROUND
micrornas  are endogenous small rnas that play important regulatory functions in plant development. genetic variations in mirnas sequences or their target-binding sites  can alter mirna targets in animal and human. whether these single nucleotide polymorphisms  in plant are functional have not yet been determined.


RESULTS
in this study, we constructed leaf, root, and stem-derived small libraries of cucumber  line  <dig>  and c. sativus var. hardwickii . a total of  <dig> conserved mirna families, nine less-conserved mirna families, and  <dig> cucumber-specific mirnas were identified in both line  <dig> and hardwickii. we employed cucumber resequencing data to perform a genome-wide scan for snps in cucumber mirna-target interaction sites, including mirna mature sequences and mirna-target binding sites. as a result, we identified a total of  <dig> snps in mature mirna sequences and  <dig> snps in mirna-target binding sites with the potential to affect mirna-target interactions. furthermore, we experimentally confirmed that these snps produced  <dig> 9930-unique targets mrnas and  <dig> hardwickii-unique targets mrna for cucumber mirnas. this is the first experimental validation of snps in mirna-target interaction sites affecting mirna-target binding in plants.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that snps can alter mirna function and produce unique mirna targets in cultivated and wild cucumbers. therefore, mirna-related snps may have played important in events that led to the agronomic differences between domestic and wild cucumber.
