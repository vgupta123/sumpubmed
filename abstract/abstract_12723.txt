BACKGROUND
bovine tuberculosis  is a contagious, debilitating human and animal disease caused by mycobacterium bovis, a member of the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. the study objective were to estimate the frequency of btb, examine genetic diversity of the m. bovis population in cattle from five regions in mali and to determine whether m. bovis is involved in active tuberculosis  in humans. samples from suspected lesions on cattle at the slaughterhouses were collected. mycobacterial smear, culture confirmation, and spoligotyping were used for diagnosis and species identification. mycobacterium dna from tb patients was spoligotyped to identify m. bovis.


RESULTS
in total,  <dig> cattle have been examined for lesions in the five regions of mali. out of  <dig> cattle,  <dig> specimens presented lesions and then examined for the presence of m. bovis. thus,  <dig>  were identified as m. bovis; eight  were non-tuberculous mycobacterium . nineteen spoligotype patterns were identified among  <dig> samples with five novel patterns. one case of m. bovis  was identified among 67 tb patients.


CONCLUSIONS
this study estimates a relatively true proportion of btb in the regions of mali and reveals new spoligotype patterns.
