BACKGROUND
speech-related disorders may refer to impairment of temporal analysis in the human auditory system. by the advance of non-invasive brain stimulation new forms of therapy arise. in the present study, we examined the neuromodulatory effect of auditory tdcs on the perception of temporal modulated speech syllables. in three experimental sessions we assessed phonetic categorization of consonant–vowels -syllables  with varying voice onset times  during sham, anodal, and cathodal tdcs delivered bilateral to the auditory cortex . subsequently, we recorded auditory evoked potentials  in response to voiced  and voiceless  cv-syllables.


RESULTS
in result, we demonstrate that bilateral tdcs of the ac can modulate cv-syllable perception. behaviorally, cathodal tdcs improved phonetic categorization abilities in a vot continuum accompanied by an elevation of the p <dig> amplitude of the aep to cv-syllables during the anodal tdcs after effect.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrates the ability of bilateral tdcs over the ac to ameliorate speech perception. the results may have clinical implications by fostering potential approaches for a treatment of speech-related pathologies with a deficit of temporal processing.
