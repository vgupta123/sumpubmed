BACKGROUND
lepidoptera encompasses more than  <dig>  described species that have been classified into 45– <dig> superfamilies. the previously determined lepidoptera mitochondrial genomes  are limited to six superfamilies of the lineage ditrysia. compared with the ancestral insect gene order, these mitogenomes all contain a trna rearrangement. to gain new insights into lepidoptera mitogenome evolution, we sequenced the mitogenomes of two ghost moths that belong to the non-ditrysian lineage hepialoidea and conducted a comparative mitogenomic analysis across lepidoptera.


RESULTS
the mitogenomes of thitarodes renzhiensis and t. yunnanensis are  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp long with an a + t content of  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively. both mitogenomes include  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> transfer rna genes,  <dig> ribosomal rna genes, and the a + t-rich region. different tandem repeats in the a + t-rich region mainly account for the size difference between the two mitogenomes. all the protein-coding genes start with typical mitochondrial initiation codons, except for cox <dig>  and nad <dig>  in both mitogenomes. the anticodon of trns in t. renzhiensis and t. yunnanensis is ucu instead of the mostly used gcu in other sequenced lepidoptera mitogenomes. the  <dig> -bp sequence from rrns to nad <dig> was also determined for an unspecified ghost moth , which has no repetitive sequence in the a + t-rich region. all three thitarodes species possess the ancestral gene order with trni-trnq-trnm located between the a + t-rich region and nad <dig>  which is different from the gene order trnm-trni-trnq in all previously sequenced lepidoptera species. the formerly identified conserved elements of lepidoptera mitogenomes  are absent in the thitarodes mitogenomes.


CONCLUSIONS
the mitogenomes of t. renzhiensis and t. yunnanensis exhibit unusual features compared with the previously determined lepidoptera mitogenomes. their ancestral gene order indicates that the trna rearrangement event likely occurred after hepialoidea diverged from other lepidopteran lineages. characterization of the two ghost moth mitogenomes has enriched our knowledge of lepidoptera mitogenomes and contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying mitogenome evolution, especially gene rearrangements.
