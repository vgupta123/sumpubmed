BACKGROUND
enterovirus  <dig>  is a major causative agent of hand-foot-and-mouth disease , and infection of ev <dig> to central nerve system  may result in a high mortality in children less than 2â€‰years old. although there are two highly glycosylated membrane proteins, scarb <dig> and psgl- <dig>  which have been identified as the cellular and functional receptors of ev <dig>  the role of glycosylation in ev <dig> infection is still unclear.


RESULTS
we demonstrated that the attachment of ev <dig> to rd and sk-n-sh cells was diminished after the removal of cell surface sialic acids by neuraminidase. sialic acid specific lectins, maackia amurensis  and sambucus nigra , could compete with ev <dig> and restrained the binding of ev <dig> significantly. preincubation of rd cells with fetuin also reduced the binding of ev <dig>  in addition, we found that scarb <dig> was a sialylated glycoprotein and interaction between scarb <dig> and ev <dig> was retarded after desialylation.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we demonstrated that cell surface sialic acids assist in the attachment of ev <dig> to host cells. cell surface sialylation should be a key regulator that facilitates the binding and infection of ev <dig> to rd and sk-n-sh cells.
