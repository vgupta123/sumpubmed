BACKGROUND
micrornas are a population of short non-coding rnas with widespread negative regulatory impact on mrna translation. unrestricted somatic stem cells  are a rare population in human cord blood that can be induced into cells representative of all three germinal layers. here we analyzed the functional impact of mirnas on the osteogenic differentiation in ussc.


RESULTS
gene expression profiling identified  <dig> micrornas that were consistently upregulated during osteogenic differentiation of two different ussc cell lines . bioinformatic target gene prediction indicated that among these micrornas, mir-10a, - <dig>  -26a, -26b, and -29b recognize transcripts that encode a set of proteins inhibiting osteogenesis. we subsequently verified osteo-inhibitory cdk <dig>  ctnnbip <dig>  hdac <dig>  and tob <dig> and osteo-promoting smad <dig> as targets of these micrornas. in western blot analyses demonstrated that endogenous levels of cdk <dig> and hdac <dig> were downregulated during osteogenic differentiation of ussc and reduced following ectopic expression of mir-26a/b and mir-29b. in contrast, endogenous expression of smad <dig>  targeted by mir-26a/b, was unaltered during osteogenic differentiation of ussc or following ectopic expression of mir-26a/b. functional overexpression analyses using microrna mimics revealed that mir-26a/b, as well as mir-29b strongly accelerated osteogenic differentiation of ussc as assessed by alizarin-red staining and calcium-release assays.


CONCLUSIONS
mir-26a/b and mir-29b are upregulated during osteogenic differentiation of ussc and share target genes inhibiting osteogenesis. furthermore, these micrornas accelerate osteogenic differentiation, likely mediated by osteo-inhibitory proteins such as cdk <dig> and hdac <dig>
