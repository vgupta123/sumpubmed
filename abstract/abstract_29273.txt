BACKGROUND
cd <dig> is an inhibitory co-receptor expressed on b cells. we previously demonstrated significant association of the polymorphism of the cd <dig> gene with susceptibility to human systemic lupus erythematosus  in individuals carrying a sle-susceptible fcgr2b genotype . the human cd <dig> locus generates a splicing isoform that lacks exon  <dig>  as well as full-length cd <dig> , and the cd <dig> polymorphism regulates exon  <dig> skipping.


RESULTS
here we demonstrated that individuals carrying the disease-protective cd <dig> genotype exhibit significantly lower serum immunoglobulin levels than do individuals carrying other cd <dig> genotypes . although expression level of cd72fl in the peripheral blood b cells was similar regardless of cd <dig> genotype, the protein level of cd72Δex <dig> was increased in individuals carrying the disease-protective cd <dig> genotype, suggesting a crucial role of cd72Δex <dig> in regulation of antibody production. by expressing these human cd <dig> isoforms in mouse cell lines, we further demonstrated that cd72Δex <dig> is accumulated in endoplasmic reticulum  and fails to regulate bcr signaling whereas human cd72fl is efficiently transported to the cell surface and inhibits signaling through the b cell antigen receptor , as is the case for mouse cd <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
human cd <dig> polymorphism appears to regulate antibody production as well as susceptibility to sle by regulating expression of er-localizing cd72Δex <dig>
