BACKGROUND
the wrky transcription factor is an important member of the stress-related transcription factors, which mediate diverse abiotic stresses in many plants. however, up until now, the number of wrky members, and the regulatory mechanisms involved in abiotic stress responses in pak-choi , remained unknown.


RESULTS
we isolated and identified  <dig> full-length wrky cdnas from a pak-choi stress-induced cdna library. the  <dig> putative bcwrky proteins were divided into three groups based on structural and phylogenetic analyses. a subcellular localization prediction indicated that the putative bcwrky proteins were enriched in the nuclear region. experiments involving bcwrky <dig> and bcwrky <dig> confirmed the prediction. a total of  <dig> bcwrkys were differentially expressed in response to at least one stress condition  tested on pak-choi leaves, and a co-expression analysis indicated stress-inducible bcwrkys co-regulated multiple abiotic stresses. bcwrky <dig>  bcwrky <dig>  bcwrky <dig>  and bcwrky <dig> acted as key regulators and played dominant roles within co-regulatory networks of stress-inducible bcwrkys.


CONCLUSIONS
we first isolated and characterized the  <dig> stress-inducible wrky transcription factor family members. a total of  <dig> stress-inducible bcwrkys found in leaves can co-regulate multiple environmental stresses by integrating the potential mutual interactions of wrkys in pak-choi. this information will be valuable when exploring the molecular mechanisms of wrkys in response to abiotic stresses in plants.
