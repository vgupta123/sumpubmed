BACKGROUND
reactive gliosis had been implicated in injury and recovery patterns associated with hydrocephalus. our aim is to determine the efficacy of minocycline, an antibiotic known for its anti-inflammatory properties, to reduce reactive gliosis and inhibit the development of hydrocephalus.


RESULTS
the ventricular dilatation were evaluated by mri at 1-week post drugs treated, while gfap and iba-1were detected by rt-pcr, immunohistochemistry and western blot. the expression of gfap and iba- <dig> was significantly higher in hydrocephalic group compared with saline control group . minocycline treatment of hydrocephalic animals reduced the expression of gfap and iba- <dig> significantly . likewise, the severity of ventricular dilatation is lower in minocycline treated hydrocephalic animals compared with the no minocycline group .


CONCLUSIONS
minocycline treatment is effective in reducing the gliosis and delaying the development of hydrocephalus with prospective to be the auxiliary therapeutic method of hydrocephalus.
