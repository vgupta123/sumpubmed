BACKGROUND
molecular mechanisms underlying prion agent replication, converting host-encoded cellular prion protein  into the scrapie associated isoform , are poorly understood. selective self-interaction between prp molecules forms a basis underlying the observed differences of the prpc into prpsc conversion process . the importance of previously peptide-scanning mapped ovine prp self-interaction domains on this conversion was investigated by studying the ability of six of these ovine prp based peptides to modulate two processes; prp self-interaction and conversion.


RESULTS
three peptides  were capable of inhibiting self-interaction of prp in a solid-phase prp peptide array. three peptides  modulated prion conversion when added before or after initiation of the prion protein misfolding cyclic amplification  reaction using brain homogenates. the c-terminal peptides  only affected conversion  when added before mixing prpc and prpsc, whereas the octarepeat peptide only affected conversion when added after this mixing.


CONCLUSIONS
this study identified the putative prp core binding domain that facilitates the prpc-prpsc interaction , corroborating evidence that the region of prp containing this domain is important in the species-barrier and/or scrapie susceptibility. the octarepeats can be involved in prpc-prpsc stabilization, whereas the n-terminal glycosaminoglycan binding motif and the amyloidogenic motif indirectly affected conversion. binding domain  <dig> and the c-terminal domain are directly implicated in prpc self-interaction during the conversion process and may prove to be prime targets in new therapeutic strategy development, potentially retaining prpc function. these results emphasize the importance of probable prpc-prpc and required prpc-prpsc interactions during prp conversion. all interactions are probably part of the complex process in which polymorphisms and species barriers affect tse transmission and susceptibility.
