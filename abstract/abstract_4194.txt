BACKGROUND
beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme  is a single-membrane protein belongs to the aspartyl protease class of catabolic enzymes. this enzyme involved in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein . the cleavage of app by bace- <dig> is the rate-limiting step in the amyloid cascade leading to the production of two peptide fragments aβ <dig> and aβ <dig>  among two peptide fragments aβ <dig> is the primary species thought to be responsible for the neurotoxicity and amyloid plaque formation that lead to memory and cognitive defects in alzheimer’s disease . ad is a ravaging neurodegenerative disorder for which no disease-modifying treatment is currently available. inhibition of bace- <dig> is expected to stop amyloid plaque formation and emerged as an interesting and attractive therapeutic target for ad.

methods
ligand-based computational approach was used to identify the molecular chemical features required for the inhibition of bace- <dig> enzyme. a training set of  <dig> compounds with known experimental activity was used to generate pharmacophore hypotheses using 3d qsar pharmacophore generation module available in discovery studio. the hypothesis was validated by four different methods and the best hypothesis was utilized in database screening of four chemical databases like maybridge, chembridge, nci and asinex. the retrieved hit compounds were subjected to molecular docking study using gold  <dig>  program.


RESULTS
among ten generated pharmacophore hypotheses, hypo  <dig> was chosen as best pharmacophore hypothesis. hypo  <dig> consists of one hydrogen bond donor, one positive ionizable, one ring aromatic and two hydrophobic features with high correlation coefficient of  <dig> , highest cost difference of  <dig>  bits and lowest rmsd value of  <dig> . hypo  <dig> was validated using fischer randomization method, test set with a correlation coefficient of  <dig> , leave-one-out method and decoy set with a goodness of hit score of  <dig> . the validated hypo  <dig> was used as a 3d query in database screening and retrieved  <dig> compounds with the estimated activity value < <dig> nm. these hits were docked into the active site of bace- <dig> and further refined based on molecular interactions with the essential amino acids and good gold fitness score.


CONCLUSIONS
the best pharmacophore hypothesis, hypo  <dig>  with high predictive ability contains chemical features required for the effective inhibition of bace- <dig>  using hypo  <dig>  we have identified two compounds with diverse chemical scaffolds as potential virtual leads which, as such or upon further optimization, can be used in the designing of new bace- <dig> inhibitors.
