BACKGROUND
frost is an important abiotic stress that limits cereal production in the temperate zone. as the most frost tolerant small grain cereal, rye  is an ideal cereal model for investigating the genetic basis of frost tolerance , a complex trait with polygenic inheritance. using  <dig> genotypes from five eastern and middle european winter rye populations, this study reports a multi-platform candidate gene-based association analysis in rye using  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  and nine insertion-deletion  polymorphisms previously identified from twelve candidate genes with a putative role in the frost responsive network.


RESULTS
phenotypic data analyses of ft in three different phenotyping platforms, controlled, semi-controlled and field, revealed significant genetic variations in the plant material under study. statistically significant  associations between ft and snps/haplotypes of candidate genes were identified. two snps in sccbf <dig> and one in sccbf <dig>  all leading to amino acid exchanges, were significantly associated with ft over all three phenotyping platforms. distribution of snp effect sizes expressed as percentage of the genetic variance explained by individual snps was highly skewed towards zero with a few snps obtaining large effects. two-way epistasis was found between  <dig> pairs of candidate genes. relatively low to medium empirical correlations of snp-ft associations were observed across the three platforms underlining the need for multi-level experimentation for dissecting complex associations between genotypes and ft in rye.


CONCLUSIONS
candidate gene based-association studies are a powerful tool for investigating the genetic basis of ft in rye. results of this study support the findings of bi-parental linkage mapping and expression studies that the cbf gene family plays an essential role in ft.
