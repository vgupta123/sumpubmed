BACKGROUND
tubifex tubifex is a widespread annelid characterized by considerable variability in its taxonomic characteristics and by a mixed reproductive strategy, with both parthenogenesis and biparental reproduction. in a molecular phylogenetic analysis, we detected substantial genetic variability among sympatric tubifex spp. from the lambro river , which we suggested comprise several cryptic species. to gain insights into the evolutionary events that generated this differentiation, we performed a cytogenetic analysis in parallel with a molecular assay. approximately  <dig> cocoons of t. tubifex and t. blanchardi were collected and dissected. for each cocoon, we sequenced a fragment of the 16s rrna from half of the sibling embryos and karyotyped the other half. to generate a robust phylogeny enabling the reconstruction of the evolutionary processes shaping the diversity of these sympatric lineages, we complemented our original 16s rrna gene sequences with additional coi sequences.


RESULTS
the chromosome number distribution was consistent with the presence of at least six sympatric euploid chromosome complements , as confirmed by a fish assay performed with an homologous 18s rdna probe. all the worms with 2n =  <dig> chromosomes belonged to an already identified sibling species of t. tubifex, t. blanchardi. the six euploid sets were coherently arranged in the phylogeny, with each lineage grouping specimens with the same chromosome complement.


CONCLUSIONS
these results are compatible with the hypothesis that multiple polyploidization events, possibly enhanced by parthenogenesis, may have driven the evolution of the t. tubifex species complex.
