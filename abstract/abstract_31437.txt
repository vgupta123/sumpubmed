BACKGROUND
the sequenced genomes of cucumber, melon and watermelon have relatively few r-genes, with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> copies only, respectively. the mechanism for low copy number of r-genes in cucurbitaceae genomes remains unknown.


RESULTS
manual annotation of r-genes in the sequenced genomes of cucurbitaceae species showed that approximately half of them are pseudogenes. comparative analysis of r-genes showed frequent loss of r-gene loci in different cucurbitaceae species. phylogenetic analysis, data mining and pcr cloning using degenerate primers indicated that cucurbitaceae has limited number of r-gene lineages . comparison between r-genes from cucurbitaceae and those from poplar and soybean suggested frequent loss of r-gene lineages in cucurbitaceae. furthermore, the average number of r-genes per lineage in cucurbitaceae species is approximately 1/ <dig> that in soybean or poplar. therefore, both loss of lineages and deficient duplications in extant lineages accounted for the low copy number of r-genes in cucurbitaceae. no extensive chimeras of r-genes were found in any of the sequenced cucurbitaceae genomes. nevertheless, one lineage of r-genes from trichosanthes kirilowii, a wild cucurbitaceae species, exhibits chimeric structures caused by gene conversions, and may contain a large number of distinct r-genes in natural populations.


CONCLUSIONS
cucurbitaceae species have limited number of r-gene lineages and each genome harbors relatively few r-genes. the scarcity of r-genes in cucurbitaceae species was due to frequent loss of r-gene lineages and infrequent duplications in extant lineages. the evolutionary mechanisms for large variation of copy number of r-genes in different plant species were discussed.
