BACKGROUND
serum response factor  is a widely expressed transcription factor involved in multiple regulatory programs. it is believed that srf can toggle between disparate programs of gene expression through association with different cofactors. however, the direct evidence as to how these factors function on a genome-wide level is still lacking.


RESULTS
in the present study, i explored the functions of srf and its representative cofactors, megakaryoblastic leukemia 1/ <dig>  and ets-domain protein  <dig> , during fungal infection challenge in macrophages. the knockdown study, combined with gene expression array analysis, revealed that mkl1/ <dig> regulated srf-dependent genes were related to actin cytoskeleton organization, while elk <dig> regulated srf-dependent genes were related to external stimulus responses. subsequent chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing  suggested that many of these regulations were mediated directly in cis.


CONCLUSIONS
i conclude that srf utilizes mkl1/ <dig> to fulfill steady state cellular functions, including cytoskeletal organization, and utilizes elk <dig> to facilitate acute responses to external infection. together, these findings indicate that srf, along with its two cofactors, are important players in both cellular homeostasis and stress responses in macrophages.
