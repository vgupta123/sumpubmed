BACKGROUND
nicotine is rapidly absorbed from cigarette smoke and therefore induces a number of chronic illnesses with the widespread use of tobacco products. studies have shown a few cerebral metabolites modified by nicotine; however, endogenous metabolic profiling in brain has not been well explored.


RESULTS
h nmr-based on metabonomics was applied to investigate the endogenous metabolic profiling of brain hippocampus, nucleus acumens , prefrontal cortex  and striatum. we found that nicotine significantly increased cpp in mice, and some specific cerebral metabolites differentially changed in nicotine-treated mice. these modified metabolites included glutamate, acetylcholine, tryptamine, glucose, lactate, creatine, 3-hydroxybutyrate and nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide , which was closely associated with neurotransmitter and energy source. additionally, glutathione and taurine in hippocampus and striatum, phosphocholine in pfc and glycerol in nac were significantly modified by nicotine, implying the dysregulation of anti-oxidative stress response and membrane metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
nicotine induces significant metabonomic alterations in brain, which are involved in neurotransmitter disturbance, energy metabolism dysregulation, anti-oxidation and membrane function disruptions, as well as amino acid metabolism imbalance. these findings provide a new insight into rewarding effects of nicotine and the underlying mechanism.
