BACKGROUND
swine extraintestinal pathogenic escherichia coli  is an important pathogen that leads to economic and welfare costs in the swine industry worldwide, and is occurring with increasing frequency in china. by far, various virulence factors have been recognized in expec. here, we investigated the virulence genotypes and clonal structure of collected strains to improve the knowledge of phylogenetic traits of porcine expecs in china.


RESULTS
we isolated  <dig> chinese porcine expec strains from  <dig> to  <dig> in china. by multiplex pcr, the distribution of isolates belonging to phylogenetic groups b <dig>  b <dig>  a and d was  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. nineteen virulence-related genes were detected by pcr assay; ompa, fimh, vat, trat and iuta were highly prevalent. virulence-related genes were remarkably more prevalent in group b <dig> than in groups a, b <dig> and d; notably, usp, cnf <dig>  hlyd, papa and ibea were only found in group b <dig> strains. genotyping analysis was performed and four clusters of strains  were identified. cluster iv contained all isolates from group b <dig> and cluster iv isolates had the strongest pathogenicity in a mouse infection model. as phylogenetic group b <dig> and d expec isolates are generally considered virulent, multilocus sequence typing  analysis was performed for these isolates to further investigate genetic relationships. two novel sequence types, st <dig> and st <dig>  were discovered. among the nine clonal complexes identified among our group b <dig> and d isolates, cc <dig> and cc <dig> have been indicated to have high zoonotic pathogenicity. the distinction between group b <dig> and non-b <dig> isolates in virulence and genotype accorded with mlst analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
this study reveals significant genetic diversity among expec isolates and helps us to better understand their pathogenesis. importantly, our data suggest group b <dig>  strains have the highest risk of causing animal disease and illustrate the correlation between genotype and virulence.
