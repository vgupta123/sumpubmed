BACKGROUND
human art <dig>  carrier of the gpi- anchored dombrock blood group antigens, is an apparently inactive member of the mammalian mono-adp-ribosyltransferase  family named after the enzymatic transfer of a single adp-ribose moiety from nad+ to arginine residues of extracellular target proteins. all known mammalian art <dig> orthologues are predicted to lack art activity because of one or more changes in essential active site residues that make up the r-s-exe motif. so far, no other function has been detected.


RESULTS
here we report the identification and characterisation of art <dig> in chicken, which to our knowledge is the first true non-mammalian orthologue of a mammalian art family member. the chicken art <dig> gene has the same physical structure as its mammalian counterparts  and maps to a region of conserved linkage synteny on chromosome  <dig>  its mrna encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein with predicted n-terminal signal peptide and c-terminal gpi-anchor sequences and 47% sequence identity to human art <dig>  however, in striking contrast to its mammalian orthologues, the chicken protein contains an intact r-s-exe motif. upon ectopic expression in c-33a cells, recombinant chicken art <dig> localized at the cell surface as a gpi-anchored, highly glycosylated protein, which displayed arginine-specific art activity .


CONCLUSIONS
the avian orthologue of the "acatalytic" mammalian art <dig> is a mono-adp-ribosyltransferase with enzymatic activity comparable to that of other, catalytically active and gpi-anchored members of the mammalian art family.
