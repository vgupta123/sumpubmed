BACKGROUND
stomach contents of  <dig> specimens of five elasmobranch species  caught in the central fishing zone in the pacific ocean of colombia were counted and weighed to describe feeding habits and dietary overlaps.


RESULTS
twenty-one prey items belonging to four major groups  were identified. decapod crustaceans were the most abundant prey found in stomachs. the mantis shrimp squilla panamensis was the main prey item in the diet of m. lunulatus; tiger shrimp trachypenaeus sp. was the main prey item in the diet of rhinobatos leucorhynchus and raja velezi, and penaeidae shrimp were the main prey items in the diet of z. xyster. furthermore, fish were important in the diet of raja velezi, z. xyster and d. longa. the greatest diet breadth corresponded to z. xyster whereas m. lunulatus was the most specialized predator. finally, four significant diet overlaps between the five species were found, attributable mainly to squillidae, penaeidae and fish.


CONCLUSIONS
shrimps  and benthic fishes were the most important food types in the diet of the elasmobranch species studied. diet breadth and overlap were relatively low. determination of food resource partitioning among the batoid species studied was not possible. however, we identified partitions in other niche axes . it is possible to assume that diffuse competition could be exceeding the biunivocal competition among the studied species. therefore, this assemblage would have a strong tendency to trophic guild formation.
