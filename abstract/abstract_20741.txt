BACKGROUND
in biological systems, pathways coordinate or interact with one another to achieve a complex biological process. studying how they influence each other is essential for understanding the intricacies of a biological system. however, current methods rely on statistical tests to determine pathway relations, and may lose numerous biologically significant relations.


RESULTS
this study proposes a method that identifies the pathway relations by measuring the functional relations between pathways based on the gene ontology  annotations. this approach identified  <dig>  pathway relations among  <dig> pathways from pathway interaction database . using  <dig> pathway interactions from pid as testing data, the function-based approach  is able to identify 93% of pathway interactions, better than the existing methods based on the shared components and protein-protein interactions. many well-known pathway cross-talks are only identified by fba. in addition, the false positive rate of fba is significantly lower than others via pathway co-expression analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
this function-based approach appears to be more sensitive and able to infer more biologically significant and explainable pathway relations.
