BACKGROUND
pseudouridine  is an abundant modified nucleoside in rna and a number of studies have shown that the presence of Ψ affects rna structure and function. the positions of Ψ in spliceosomal small nuclear rnas  have been determined for a number of species but not for the snrnas from caenorhabditis elegans , a popular experimental model system of development.


RESULTS
as a prelude to determining the function of or requirement for this modification in snrnas, we have mapped the positions of Ψ in u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  and u <dig> snrnas from worms using a specific primer extension method. as with other species, c. elegans u <dig> snrna has the greatest number of Ψ residues, with nine, located in the 5' half of the u <dig> snrna. u <dig> snrna has three Ψs, in or near the loop of the large stem-loop that dominates the structure of this rna. u <dig> and u <dig> snrnas each have one Ψ, and two Ψ residues were found in u <dig> snrna.


CONCLUSIONS
the total number of Ψs found in the snrnas of c. elegans is significantly higher than the minimal amount found in yeasts but it is lower than that seen in sequenced vertebrate snrnas. when the actual sites of modification on c. elegans snrnas are compared with other sequenced snrnas most of the positions correspond to modifications found in other species. however, two of the positions modified on c. elegans snrnas are unique, one at position  <dig> on u <dig> snrna and one at position  <dig> on u <dig> snrna. both of these modifications are in regions of these snrnas that interact with u <dig> snrna either in the spliceosome or in the u4/u <dig> small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle  and the presence of Ψ may be involved in strengthening the intermolecular association of the snrnas.
