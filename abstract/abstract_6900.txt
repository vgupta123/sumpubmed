BACKGROUND
the recognition that human tumors stimulate the production of autoantibodies has initiated the use of this immune response as serological markers for the early diagnosis and management of cancer. the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  is the most common method used in detecting autoantibodies, which involves coating the microtiter plate with the tumor associated antigen  of interest and allowing serum antibodies to bind. the patient's sample is directly in contact with the coating antigen so the protein used for coating must be pure to avoid non-specific binding. in this study, a simplified method to selectively and specifically immobilize taas onto microtiter plates in order to detect circulating autoantibodies in cancer patients without prior purification process was described. wild type full-length p <dig> protein was produced in fusion with biotin carboxyl carrier peptide  or hexahistidine  using pak <dig> and pet15b vectors, respectively. the recombinant p <dig> fusion protein produced was then subjected to react with either a commercial p <dig> monoclonal antibody  or sera from lung cancer patients and healthy volunteers in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  format.


RESULTS
both of the immobilized p <dig> fusion proteins as well as the purified 6-p <dig> fusion protein had a similar dose response of detection to a commercial p <dig> mab . when the biotinylated p53-bccp fusion protein was used as an antigen to detect p <dig> autoantibodies in clinical samples, the result showed that human serum reacted strongly to avidin-coated microwell even in the absence of the biotinylated p53-bccp fusion protein, thus compromised its ability to differentiate weakly positive sera from those that were negative. in contrast, the 6-p <dig> protein immobilized directly onto ni+ coated microplate was able to identify the p <dig> autoantibody positive serum. in addition, its reactivity to clinical serum samples highly correlated with those obtained from using purified p <dig> as an antigen . moreover, this directly immobilized p <dig> antigen can clearly differentiate p <dig> autoantibody positive sera in cancer patients from healthy volunteers' sera.


CONCLUSIONS
a method of coating directly and specifically taas onto a microtiter plate without the purification processes was developed in this study. although in this study only one tumor antigen was examined, the simplicity and the ability of coated antigens to identify p <dig> specific autoantibodies in serum accurately might enable a larger panel of taas specific autoantibodies to be explored as serological markers for cancer.
