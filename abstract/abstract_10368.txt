BACKGROUND
molecular techniques that detect canine lymphoma cells by their clonal antigen receptor gene rearrangement play an increasing role for diagnosis as well as for monitoring minimal residual disease during and after cytostatic therapy. however, the methods currently available are time-consuming and/or cost-intensive thus impeding the use in clinical routine. the aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate a real-time polymerase chain reaction  with subsequent melting curve analysis  for the detection of clonally rearranged antigen receptor genes in dogs with b and t cell lymphoma on non formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded lymph node samples.


RESULTS
in lymph node aspirates from  <dig> dogs with multicentric b cell lymphoma, real-time pcr with mca detected clonal rearrangement in 100% and conventional pcr with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  in 93% of samples. both methods correctly identified clonality in 80% of lymph node aspirates of  <dig> dogs with t cell lymphoma. none of the two pcr systems detected clonal rearrangement in samples from  <dig> dogs with lymph node hyperplasia. using a dilutional series with regular lymphoid desoxyribonucleic acid , detection limits of lymphoma dna were as low as  <dig> % and  <dig> % for b and t cell clonal rearrangement with real-time pcr and mca and at  <dig> % and  <dig> % with the conventional system. median absolute detection limits of lymphoma dna were shown to be at  <dig>  ng and 1 ng for the b and t cell immunophenotype with the real-time pcr system and at 10 ng each with conventional pcr and page.


CONCLUSIONS
real-time pcr with mca is a convenient and reliable method with a good analytical sensitivity. thus, the method may assist the detection of clonal antigen receptor gene rearrangement in canine lymphoma patients in a clinical setting also in the presence of small amounts of neoplastic cells.
