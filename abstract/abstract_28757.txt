BACKGROUND
human peripheral blood monocytes  consist of subsets distinguished by expression of cd <dig>  and chemokine receptors. classical cd16- mo express ccr <dig> and migrate in response to ccl <dig>  while a minor cd16+ mo subset expresses cd <dig> and cx3cr <dig> and migrates into tissues expressing cx3cl <dig>  cd16+ mo produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and are expanded in certain inflammatory conditions including sepsis and hiv infection.


RESULTS
to gain insight into the developmental relationship and functions of cd16+ and cd16- mo, we examined transcriptional profiles of these mo subsets in peripheral blood from healthy individuals. of  <dig>  expressed genes,  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed and  <dig> and  <dig> were >2-fold upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in cd16+ compared to cd16- mo. cd16+ mo were distinguished by upregulation of transcripts for dendritic cell   and macrophage   markers together with transcripts relevant for dc-t cell interaction , cell activation , and negative regulation of the cell cycle , whereas cd16- mo were distinguished by upregulation of transcripts for myeloid  and granulocyte markers . differential expression of csf1r, csf3r, c1qr <dig>  c3ar <dig>  cd1d, cd <dig>  cxcl <dig>  and cx3cr <dig> was confirmed by flow cytometry. furthermore, increased expression of rara and klf <dig> transcripts in cd16+ mo coincided with absence of cell surface cutaneous lymphocyte associated antigen  expression, indicating potential imprinting for non-skin homing.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that cd16+ and cd16- mo originate from a common myeloid precursor, with cd16+ mo having a more mΦ – and dc-like transcription program suggesting a more advanced stage of differentiation. distinct transcriptional programs, together with their recruitment into tissues via different mechanisms, also suggest that cd16+ and cd16- mo give rise to functionally distinct dc and mΦ in vivo.
