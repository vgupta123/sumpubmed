BACKGROUND
the aim of the work is the application of a bolus tracking technique for tomographic evaluation of the uretero-vesicular junction in dogs. ten adult dogs  with variable body weight  were enrolled in the prospective study. the patients were placed in sternal recumbency with a 10° elevated pelvis and the visualization of the uretero-vesicular junction was obtained with the bolus tracking technique after intravenous administration of non-ionic contrast medium. in the post-contrast late phase a region of interest was placed within the lumen of the distal ureters and the density values were monitored before starting the helical scan.


RESULTS
the uretero-vesicular junction was clearly visible in 100 % of patients with the visualization of the endoluminal ureteral contrast enhancement and bladder washout. at the end of the tomographic study an evaluation of the dose records was performed and compared to human exposures reported in literature for the pelvic region. the effective dose estimated for each patient  proved to be elevated, when compared to those reported in human patients.


CONCLUSIONS
the bolus tracking technique could be applied for the visualization of the uretero-vesicular junction in non-pathological patients, placing the region of interest in the distal ureters. the high effective doses recorded in our study support the need of specific thresholds for veterinary patients, pointing out the attention for paediatric patient’s exposure also in veterinary imaging.
