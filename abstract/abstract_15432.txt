BACKGROUND
the circadian expression of the mammalian clock genes is based on transcriptional feedback loops. two basic helix-loop-helix  pas  domain-containing transcriptional activators, clock and bmal <dig>  are known to regulate gene expression by interacting with a promoter element termed the e-box . the non-canonical e-boxes or e-box-like sequences have also been reported to be necessary for circadian oscillation.


RESULTS
we report a new cis-element required for cell-autonomous circadian transcription of clock genes. this new element consists of a canonical e-box or a non-canonical e-box and an e-box-like sequence in tandem with the latter with a short interval,  <dig> base pairs, between them. we demonstrate that both e-box or e-box-like sequences are needed to generate cell-autonomous oscillation. we also verify that the spacing nucleotides with constant length between these  <dig> e-elements are crucial for robust oscillation. furthermore, by in silico analysis we conclude that several clock and clock-controlled genes possess a direct repeat of the e-box-like elements in their promoter region.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose a novel possible mechanism regulated by double e-box-like elements, not to a single e-box, for circadian transcriptional oscillation. the direct repeat of the e-box-like elements identified in this study is the minimal required element for the generation of cell-autonomous transcriptional oscillation of clock and clock-controlled genes.
