BACKGROUND
omt  genes are involved in lignin biosynthesis, which relates to stover cell wall digestibility. reduced lignin content is an important determinant of both forage quality and ethanol conversion efficiency of maize stover.


RESULTS
variation in genomic sequences coding for comt, ccoaomt <dig>  and ccoaomt <dig> was analyzed in relation to stover cell wall digestibility for a panel of  <dig> european forage maize inbred lines, and re-analyzed for a panel of  <dig> lines from a published french study. different methodologies for association analysis were performed and compared. across association methodologies, a total number of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> comt polymorphic sites were significantly associated with dndf, omd, ndf, and wsc, respectively. association analysis for ccoaomt <dig> and ccoaomt <dig> identified substantially fewer polymorphic sites  associated with the investigated traits. our re-analysis on the  <dig> lines from a published french dataset identified  <dig> polymorphic sites significantly associated with cell wall digestibility, two of them were consistent with our study. promising polymorphisms putatively causally associated with variability of cell wall digestibility were inferred from the total number of significantly associated snps/indels.


CONCLUSIONS
several polymorphic sites for three o-methyltransferase loci were associated with stover cell wall digestibility. all three tested genes seem to be involved in controlling dndf, in particular comt. thus, considerable variation among bm <dig> wildtype alleles can be exploited for improving cell-wall digestibility. target sites for functional markers were identified enabling development of efficient marker-based selection strategies.
