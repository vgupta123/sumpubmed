BACKGROUND
protein kinases are key regulators of cell function and play essential roles in the occurrence and development of many human diseases. many kinase inhibitors have been used for molecular targeted treatment of those diseases such as cancer and inflammation. however, those highly hydrophobic kinase inhibitors shared the common features of poor bioavailability and limited in vivo half-life, which strongly impeded their practical applications. our previous study demonstrated that microbial synthesized biodegradable polyester poly , a member of polyhydroxyalkanoates  family, could serve as a promising delivery nanocarrier for those hydrophobic kinase inhibitors. recently, a novel natural synthesized hybrid copolymer, peg <dig> end-capped phbhhx  was produced by aeromonas hydrophila fermentation. in this study, the novel phbhhxpeg nps were prepared and investigated to serve as intracellular delivery nanocarriers for sustained release of hydrophobic kinase inhibitors.


RESULTS
phbhhxpeg nanoparticles  prepared by an emulsification–solvent evaporation method were spherical with a diameter around 200 nm. the entrapment efficiency on rapamycin in phbhhxpeg nps was  <dig> % and the sustained release of rapamycin from phbhhxpeg nps could be achieved for almost  <dig> days. the cellular uptake of phbhhxpeg nps was significant higher than that of phbhhx nps. the anti-proliferation effect and mtor inhibition ability of rapamycin-loaded phbhhxpeg nps was stronger than that of drug-loaded phbhhx nps and free rapamycin.


CONCLUSIONS
phbhhxpeg nps could achieve the efficient entrapment and sustained release of rapamycin. the novel biodegradable phbhhxpeg appeared a promising nanocarrier for sustained delivery of hydrophobic kinase inhibitors with improved cellular uptake and kinase inhibition efficiency.
