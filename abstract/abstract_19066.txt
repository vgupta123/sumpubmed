BACKGROUND
chromosomal instability  is the most prevalent type of genomic instability in gastric tumours, but its role in malignant transformation of the gastric mucosa is still obscure. in the present study, we set out to study whether two morphologically distinct categories of gastric cancer precursor lesions, i.e. intestinal-type and pyloric gland adenomas, would carry different patterns of dna copy number changes, possibly reflecting distinct genetic pathways of gastric carcinogenesis in these two adenoma types.


RESULTS
using a 5k bac array cgh platform, we showed that the most common aberrations shared by the  <dig> intestinal-type and  <dig> pyloric gland adenomas were gains of chromosomes  <dig> , 11q  and  <dig> , and losses of chromosomes 13q ,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the most frequent aberrations in intestinal-type gastric adenoma were gains on 11q, 9q and  <dig>  and losses on chromosomes 5q,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  whereas in pyloric gland gastric adenomas these were gains on chromosome  <dig> and losses on 5q and  <dig>  however, no significant differences were observed between the two adenoma types.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that gains on chromosomes  <dig>  9q, 11q and  <dig>  and losses on chromosomes 5q,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  likely represent early events in gastric carcinogenesis. the phenotypical entities, intestinal-type and pyloric gland adenomas, however, do not differ significantly  at the level of dna copy number changes.
