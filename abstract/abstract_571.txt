BACKGROUND
as economically relevant traits, feeding behavior and food preference domestication determine production cost and profitability. although there are intensive research efforts on feeding behavior and food intake, little is known about food preference. mandarin fish accept only live prey fish and refuse dead prey fish or artificial diets. very little is currently known about the genes regulating this unique food preference.


RESULTS
using transcriptome sequencing and digital gene expression profiling, we identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  differentially expressed genes in feeders and nonfeeders of dead prey fish, respectively. up-regulation of crbp, rgr and rdh <dig>  and down-regulation of gc expression, consistent with greater visual ability in feeders, could promote positive phototaxis. altered expressions of period, casein kinase and rev-erbÎ± might reset circadian phase. down-regulation of orexigenic and up-regulation of anorexigenic genes in feeders were associated with lower appetite. the mrna levels of creb, c-fos, c/ebp, zif <dig>  bdnf and syt were dramatically decreased in feeders, which might result in significant deficiency in memory retention of its natural food preference . there were roughly  <dig> times more potential snps in feeders than in nonfeeders.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, differential expression in the genes identified shed new light on why mandarin fish only feed on live prey fish, with pathways regulating retinal photosensitivity, circadian rhythm, appetite control, learning and memory involved. we also found dramatic difference in snp abundance in feeders vs nonfeeders. these differences together might account for the different food preferences. elucidating the genes regulating the unique food preference  in mandarin fish could lead to a better understanding of mechanisms controlling food preference in animals, including mammals.
