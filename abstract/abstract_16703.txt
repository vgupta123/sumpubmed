BACKGROUND
the transcription factor pax <dig> is essential for the differentiation of thyroid cells. however, there are few data on genes transcriptionally regulated by pax <dig> other than thyroid-related genes. to better understand the role of pax <dig> in the biology of thyroid cells, we obtained transcriptional profiles of pax8-silenced pccl <dig> thyroid cells using whole genome expression arrays and integrated these signals with global cis-regulatory sequencing studies performed by chip-seq analysis


RESULTS
exhaustive analysis of pax <dig> immunoprecipitated peaks demonstrated preferential binding to intragenic regions and cpg-enriched islands, which suggests a role of pax <dig> in transcriptional regulation of orphan cpg regions. in addition, chip-seq allowed us to identify pax <dig> partners, including proteins involved in tertiary dna structure  and chromatin remodeling , and these direct transcriptional interactions were confirmed in vivo. moreover, both factors modulate pax8-dependent transcriptional activation of the sodium iodide symporter  gene promoter. we ultimately combined putative and novel pax <dig> binding sites with actual target gene expression regulation to define pax8-dependent genes. functional classification suggests that pax8-regulated genes may be directly involved in important processes of thyroid cell function such as cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis, cell polarity, motion and adhesion, and a plethora of dna/protein-related processes.


CONCLUSIONS
our study provides novel insights into the role of pax <dig> in thyroid biology, exerted through transcriptional regulation of important genes involved in critical thyrocyte processes. in addition, we found new transcriptional partners of pax <dig>  which functionally cooperate with pax <dig> in the regulation of thyroid gene transcription. besides, our data demonstrate preferential location of pax <dig> in non-promoter cpg regions. these data point to an orphan cpg island-mediated mechanism that represents a novel role of pax <dig> in the transcriptional output of the thyrocyte.
