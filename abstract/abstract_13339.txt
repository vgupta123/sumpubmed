BACKGROUND
human genome contains millions of common single nucleotide polymorphisms  and these snps play an important role in understanding the association between genetic variations and human diseases. many snps show correlated genotypes, or linkage disequilibrium , thus it is not necessary to genotype all snps for association study. many algorithms have been developed to find a small subset of snps called tag snps that are sufficient to infer all the other snps. algorithms based on the r <dig> ld statistic have gained popularity because r <dig> is directly related to statistical power to detect disease associations. most of existing r <dig> based algorithms use pairwise ld. recent studies show that multi-marker ld can help further reduce the number of tag snps. however, existing tag snp selection algorithms based on multi-marker ld are both time-consuming and memory-consuming. they cannot work on chromosomes containing more than  <dig> k snps using length- <dig> tagging rules.


RESULTS
we propose an efficient algorithm called fasttagger to calculate multi-marker tagging rules and select tag snps based on multi-marker ld. fasttagger uses several techniques to reduce running time and memory consumption. our experiment results show that fasttagger is several times faster than existing multi-marker based tag snp selection algorithms, and it consumes much less memory at the same time. as a result, fasttagger can work on chromosomes containing more than  <dig> k snps using length- <dig> tagging rules.

fasttagger also produces smaller sets of tag snps than existing multi-marker based algorithms, and the reduction ratio ranges from 3%-9% when length- <dig> tagging rules are used. the generated tagging rules can also be used for genotype imputation. we studied the prediction accuracy of individual rules, and the average accuracy is above 96% when r <dig> â‰¥  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
generating multi-marker tagging rules is a computation intensive task, and it is the bottleneck of existing multi-marker based tag snp selection methods. fasttagger is a practical and scalable algorithm to solve this problem.
