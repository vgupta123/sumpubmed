BACKGROUND
the task of recognizing and identifying species names in biomedical literature has recently been regarded as critical for a number of applications in text and data mining, including gene name recognition, species-specific document retrieval, and semantic enrichment of biomedical articles.


RESULTS
in this paper we describe an open-source species name recognition and normalization software system, linnaeus, and evaluate its performance relative to several automatically generated biomedical corpora, as well as a novel corpus of full-text documents manually annotated for species mentions. linnaeus uses a dictionary-based approach  to identify species names and a set of heuristics to resolve ambiguous mentions. when compared against our manually annotated corpus, linnaeus performs with 94% recall and 97% precision at the mention level, and 98% recall and 90% precision at the document level. our system successfully solves the problem of disambiguating uncertain species mentions, with 97% of all mentions in pubmed central full-text documents resolved to unambiguous ncbi taxonomy identifiers.


CONCLUSIONS
linnaeus is an open source, stand-alone software system capable of recognizing and normalizing species name mentions with speed and accuracy, and can therefore be integrated into a range of bioinformatics and text-mining applications. the software and manually annotated corpus can be downloaded freely at http://linnaeus.sourceforge.net/.
