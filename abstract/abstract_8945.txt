BACKGROUND
pepsin-trypsin resistant gliadin  promotes intestinal tissue inflammation and increases paracellular permeability of immunogenic gliadin peptides into the lamina propria. this leads to the complications seen in the pathogenesis of celiac disease . in this study, specific anti-gliadin igy antibody was produced and evaluated for its efficacy on gliadin induced intestinal integrity impairment and proinflammatory effects on intestinal epithelial  cell culture model for cd.

methods
caco- <dig>  monolayers were subjected to  <dig> experimental conditions : phosphatebufferedsaline , pancreatic digested-casein , pt-gliadin , non-specific igy with pt-gliadin, and anti-wheat gliadin igy with pt-gliadin at a ratio of 1: <dig> , 1: <dig>  and 1: <dig> . caco- <dig> monolayers were then evaluated for effects of gliadin and/or anti-wheat gliadin igy after  <dig> h exposure. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  was used to quantify anti-inflammatory markers   <dig> days after cells were exposed to pt-gliadin and/or anti-wheat gliadin igy.


RESULTS
among other conditions, anti-wheat gliadin igy at a ratio of 1: <dig>   significantlyprevented gliadin toxicity on caco- <dig> by maintaining intestinal integrity, inhibiting phenol red permeation, and inhibiting gliadin absorption and production of proinflammatory cytokines  as compared to pt-gliadin stimulated cultures .


CONCLUSIONS
the anti-wheat gliadin igy antibody produced in this study has proved to inhibit absorption of gliadin and gliadin-induced inflammatory response in caco <dig> cell culture model of cd. anti-gliadin igy, therefore has potential to be used as an oral passive antibody therapy to treat cd.
