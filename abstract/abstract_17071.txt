BACKGROUND
enzymatic degradation of chitin has attracted substantial attention because chitin is an abundant renewable natural resource, second only to lignocellulose, and because of the promising applications of n-acetylglucosamine in the bioethanol, food and pharmaceutical industries. however, the low activity and poor tolerance to salts and n-acetylglucosamine of most reported β-n-acetylglucosaminidases limit their applications. mining for novel enzymes from new microorganisms is one way to address this problem.


RESULTS
a glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  β-n-acetylglucosaminidase  was identified from microbacterium sp. hj <dig> harboured in the saline soil of an abandoned salt mine and was expressed in escherichia coli. the purified recombinant enzyme showed specific activities of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol min− <dig> mg− <dig> towards p-nitrophenyl β-n-acetylglucosaminide and n,n'-diacetyl chitobiose, respectively, a v
max of 3097 ± 124 μmol min− <dig> mg− <dig> towards p-nitrophenyl β-n-acetylglucosaminide and a k
i of  <dig>  mm for n-acetylglucosamine inhibition. most metal ions and chemical reagents at final concentrations of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm or  <dig>  and  <dig> %  had little or no effect  on the enzyme activity. the enzyme can retain more than  <dig> % activity and good stability in  <dig> – <dig> %  nacl. compared with most glcnacases, the activity of the enzyme is considerably higher and the tolerance to salts and n-acetylglucosamine is much better. furthermore, the enzyme had higher proportions of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, alanine, glycine, random coils and negatively charged surfaces but lower proportions of cysteine, lysine, α-helices and positively charged surfaces than its homologs. these molecular characteristics were hypothesised as potential factors in the adaptation for salt tolerance and high activity of the gh  <dig> glcnacase.


CONCLUSIONS
biochemical characterization revealed that the glcnacase had novel salt–glcnac tolerance and high activity. these characteristics suggest that the enzyme has versatile potential in biotechnological applications, such as bioconversion of chitin waste and the processing of marine materials and saline foods. molecular characterization provided an understanding of the molecular–function relationships for the salt tolerance and high activity of the gh  <dig> glcnacase.
