BACKGROUND
the molecular basis of the increased susceptibility of steatotic livers to warm ischemia/reperfusion  injury during transplantation remains undefined. animal model for warm i/r injury was induced in obese zucker rats. lean zucker rats provided controls. two dimensional differential gel electrophoresis was performed with liver protein extracts. protein features with significant abundance ratios  between the two cohorts were selected and analyzed with hplc/ms. proteins were identified by uniprot database. interactive protein networks were generated using ingenuity pathway analysis and granite software.


RESULTS
the relative abundance of  <dig> proteins was observed in warm i/r injury. functional grouping revealed four categories of importance: molecular chaperones/endoplasmic reticulum  stress, oxidative stress, metabolism, and cell structure. hypoxia up-regulated  <dig>  calcium binding protein  <dig>  calreticulin, heat shock protein   <dig>  hsp- <dig>  and protein disulfide isomerase  <dig> were chaperonins significantly  down-regulated and only one chaperonin, hsp-1was significantly upregulated in steatotic liver following i/r.


CONCLUSIONS
down-regulation of the chaperones identified in this analysis may contribute to the increased er stress and, consequently, apoptosis and necrosis. this study provides an initial platform for future investigation of the role of chaperones and therapeutic targets for increasing the viability of steatotic liver allografts.
