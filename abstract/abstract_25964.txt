BACKGROUND
observed co-expression of a group of genes is frequently attributed to co-regulation by shared transcription factors. this assumption has led to the hypothesis that promoters of co-expressed genes should share common regulatory motifs, which forms the basis for numerous computational tools that search for these motifs. while frequently explored for yeast, the validity of the underlying hypothesis has not been assessed systematically in mammals. this demonstrates the need for a systematic and quantitative evaluation to what degree co-expressed genes share over-represented motifs for mammals.


RESULTS
we identified  <dig> experiments for human and mouse in the arrayexpress database where transcription factors were manipulated and which exhibited a significant number of differentially expressed genes. we checked for over-representation of transcription factor binding sites in up- or down-regulated genes using the over-representation analysis tool opossum. in  <dig> out of  <dig> experiments, this procedure identified the binding matrices of the affected transcription factors. we also carried out de novo prediction of regulatory motifs shared by differentially expressed genes. again, the detected motifs shared significant similarity with the matrices of the affected transcription factors.


CONCLUSIONS
our results support the claim that functional regulatory motifs are over-represented in sets of differentially expressed genes and that they can be detected with computational methods.
