BACKGROUND
green fluorescent protein  is a useful biomarker, widely used in biomedical research to track stem cells after transplantation and/or to assess therapeutic transgene expression. however, both gfp and therapeutic gene products themselves may be immunogenic to the recipient. the main aim of this study was to use animal models to evaluate potential impact of gfp on the cell engraftment and to optimize tracking strategies prior to transplantation.


RESULTS
by using a fluorescent imaging  system, we investigated the dynamic cell behavior of gfp-transduced myoblasts in tibialis anterior  muscles of immunocompetent mdx mice and immuno-compromised nude mice over a period of threeÂ months. the results suggested an apparent underlying host immunorejection in the mdx mice. dystrophin immunostaining showed that the engraftment of wild type myoblasts was much more effective than that of the gfp-labeled counterparts in the mdx mice, further confirming an antigen role of gfp in this process. we tracked the gfp-transduced myoblasts in c57bl/ <dig> mice and found gfp to be minimally immunogenic in these animals, as indicated by the gfp signal maintaining a much stronger level than that found in mdx and balb/c mice at parallel time points. we also compared the in vivo cell behavior differences between myoblasts from virally gfp-transduced and gfp transgenic mice. the latter displayed much better engraftment, as determined both biomaging and histological observations.


CONCLUSIONS
our results not only demonstrated the immunogenicity of gfp in immunocompetent mice, but determined the optimized conditions for gfp-based in vivo stem cells tracking, that can potentially be extrapolated to human biomedical research.
