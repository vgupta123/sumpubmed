BACKGROUND
the stress response is a critical factor in the training of equine athletes; it is important for performance and for protection of the animal against physio-pathological disorders.

in this study, the molecular mechanisms involved in the response to acute and strenuous exercise were investigated using peripheral blood mononuclear cells .


RESULTS
quantitative real-time pcr  was used to detect modifications in transcription levels of the genes for matrix metalloproteinase- <dig>  and interleukin  <dig> , which were derived from previous genome-wide expression analysis. significant up-regulation of these two genes was found in  <dig> horses that had completed a race of 90â€“ <dig> km in a time-course experimental design.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that mmp- <dig> and il- <dig> are both involved in the exercise-induced stress response, and this represents a starting point from which to understand the adaptive responses to this phenomenon.
