BACKGROUND
in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the essential small ubiquitin-like modifier  protease ulp <dig> is responsible for both removing sumo/smt <dig> from specific target proteins and for processing precursor sumo into its conjugation-competent form. ulp <dig> localizes predominantly to nuclear pore complexes but has also been shown to deconjugate sumoylated septins at the bud-neck of dividing cells. how ulp <dig> is directed to bud-neck localized septins and other cytoplasmic deconjugation targets is not well understood.


RESULTS
using a structure/function approach, we set out to elucidate features of ulp <dig> that are required for substrate targeting. to aid our studies, we took advantage of a catalytically inactive mutant of ulp <dig> that is greatly enriched at the septin ring of dividing yeast cells. we found that the localization of ulp <dig> to the septins requires both sumo and specific structural features of ulp1's catalytic domain. our analysis identified a 218-amino acid, substrate-trapping mutant of the catalytic domain of ulp <dig>  ulp <dig>  that is necessary and sufficient for septin localization. we also used the targeting and sumo-binding properties of ulp <dig> to purify smt3-modified proteins from cell extracts.


CONCLUSIONS
our study provides novel insights into how the ulp <dig> sumo protease is actively targeted to its substrates in vivo and in vitro. furthermore, we found that a substrate-trapping ulp <dig> interacts robustly with human sumo <dig>  sumo <dig> and sumo <dig> chains, making it a potentially useful tool for the analysis and purification of sumo-modified proteins.
