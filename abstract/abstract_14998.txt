BACKGROUND
macromolecular docking is a challenging field of bioinformatics. developing new algorithms is a slow process generally involving routine tasks that should be found in a robust library and not programmed from scratch for every new software application.


RESULTS
we present an object-oriented python/c++ library to help the development of new docking methods. this library contains low-level routines like pdb-format manipulation functions as well as high-level tools for docking and analyzing results. we also illustrate the ease of use of this library with the detailed implementation of a 3-body docking procedure.


CONCLUSIONS
the ptools library can handle molecules at coarse-grained or atomic resolution and allows users to rapidly develop new software. the library is already in use for protein-protein and protein-dna docking with the attract program and for simulation analysis. this library is freely available under the gnu gpl license, together with detailed documentation.
