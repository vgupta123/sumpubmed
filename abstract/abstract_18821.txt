BACKGROUND
a taqman real-time pcr assay targeting the anaplasma citrate synthase gene, glta, was developed and used for detection of anaplasma phagocytophilum in  <dig> ixodes ricinus ticks collected from dogs and cats in northern norway  and telemark county in southern norway .


RESULTS
among the ticks from northern norway the prevalence of a. phagocytophilum was  <dig>  %, while the prevalence in southern norway was  <dig>  % . the glta pcr assay showed a high analytical sensitivity  and efficiency , and its utility in clinical diagnostics should be evaluated in future studies.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of a. phagocytophilum occurrence in ticks collected north of the arctic circle in norway. the prevalence is comparable to that found in telemark county in southern norway.
