BACKGROUND
aberrant dna methylation is a hallmark of many cancers. classically there are two types of endometrial cancer, endometrioid adenocarcinoma , or type i, and uterine papillary serous carcinoma , or type ii. however, the whole genome dna methylation changes in these two classical types of endometrial cancer is still unknown.


RESULTS
here we described complete genome-wide dna methylome maps of eac, upsc, and normal endometrium by applying a combined strategy of methylated dna immunoprecipitation sequencing  and methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion sequencing . we discovered distinct genome-wide dna methylation patterns in eac and upsc:  <dig>  and  <dig>  recurrent differentially methylated regions  were identified respectively, compared with normal endometrium. over 80% of dmrs were in intergenic and intronic regions. the majority of these dmrs were not interrogated on the commonly used infinium 450k array platform. large-scale demethylation of chromosome x was detected in upsc, accompanied by decreased xist expression. importantly, we discovered that the majority of the dmrs harbored promoter or enhancer functions and are specifically associated with genes related to uterine development and disease. among these, abnormal methylation of transposable elements  may provide a novel mechanism to deregulate normal endometrium-specific enhancers derived from specific tes.


CONCLUSIONS
dna methylation changes are an important signature of endometrial cancer and regulate gene expression by affecting not only proximal promoters but also distal enhancers.
