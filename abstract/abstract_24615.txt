BACKGROUND
genetic influences underpinning complex traits are thought to involve multiple quantitative trait loci  of small effect size. detection of such qtl associations requires systematic screening of large numbers of dna markers within large sample populations. using pooled dna on snp microarrays to screen for allelic frequency differences between groups such as cases and controls  has been validated as an efficient solution on both  <dig> k and  <dig> k platforms. we demonstrate that this approach can be effectively applied to the truly genomewide affymetrix genechip® mapping  <dig> k array.


RESULTS
in comparisons between five independent dna pools  on separate affymetrix genechip® mapping  <dig> k array sets, we show that, for snps with minor allele frequencies >  <dig> , the reliability of the rank order of estimated allele frequencies, assessed as the average correlation between allele frequency estimates across the dna pools, was  <dig>  . similarly, validity of the snp-map approach was demonstrated by a rank-order correlation of  <dig>   between the average dna pool allele frequency estimates and the allele frequencies of an independent  sample of  <dig> unrelated individually genotyped subjects.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that snp-map can be extended for use on the affymetrix genechip® mapping  <dig> k array, providing a cost-effective, reliable and valid initial screen of  <dig> k snp microarrays in genomewide association scans.
