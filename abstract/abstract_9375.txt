BACKGROUND
we present here the assembly of the bovine genome. the assembly method combines the bac plus wgs local assembly used for the rat and sea urchin with the whole genome shotgun  only assembly used for many other animal genomes including the rhesus macaque.


RESULTS
the assembly process consisted of multiple phases: first, bacs were assembled with bac generated sequence, then subsequently in combination with the individual overlapping wgs reads. different assembly parameters were tested to separately optimize the performance for each bac assembly of the bac and wgs reads. in parallel, a second assembly was produced using only the wgs sequences and a global whole genome assembly method. the two assemblies were combined to create a more complete genome representation that retained the high quality bac-based local assembly information, but with gaps between bacs filled in with the wgs-only assembly. finally, the entire assembly was placed on chromosomes using the available map information.

over 90% of the assembly is now placed on chromosomes. the estimated genome size is  <dig>  gb which represents a high degree of completeness, with 95% of the available est sequences found in assembled contigs. the quality of the assembly was evaluated by comparison to  <dig> finished bacs, where the draft assembly covers between  <dig>  and 100%  of the finished bacs. the assembly contigs and scaffolds align linearly to the finished bacs, suggesting that misassemblies are rare. genotyping and genetic mapping of  <dig>  snps revealed that more than  <dig> % were correctly positioned within the btau_ <dig>  assembly, confirming the accuracy of the assembly.


CONCLUSIONS
the biological analysis of this bovine genome assembly is being published, and the sequence data is available to support future bovine research.
