BACKGROUND
il- <dig> is a multifunctional cytokine that has both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions. although il- <dig> has been shown to potently inhibit lung fibrosis, the detailed mechanism of il- <dig> in this process is poorly understood. epithelial–mesenchymal transition  is one of the key mechanisms involved in pulmonary fibrosis. we assessed the effects of il- <dig> on tgf-β1-induced emt in alveolar epithelial cells.

methods
a <dig> cells  were incubated with tgf-β <dig>  il- <dig>  or both tgf-β <dig> and il- <dig>  and changes in e-cadherin, β-catenin, vimentin and a-sma levels were measured using real-time pcr, western blotting and fluorescence microscopy. the related proteins in the jak/stat and tgf-β/smad signalling pathways were examined by western blot.


RESULTS
il- <dig> increased the expression of epithelial phenotypic markers, including e-cadherin and β-catenin, and inhibited mesenchymal phenotypic markers, including vimentin and a-sma in a <dig> cells. moreover, tgf-β1-induced emt was attenuated by il- <dig>  furthermore, we found that tgf-β <dig> activated the phosphorylation of jak <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig>  smad <dig>  smad <dig> and smad <dig>  and il- <dig> partially inhibited these changes in this process. when cells were treated with the stat <dig> specific inhibitor wp <dig> and the smad <dig> specific inhibitor sis <dig>  the inhibition of emt by il- <dig> was significantly strengthened.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that il- <dig> attenuates epithelial–mesenchymal transition in alveolar epithelial cells in the absence or presence of tgf-β <dig> through the jak/stat and tgf-β/smad signalling pathways.
