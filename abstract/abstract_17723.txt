BACKGROUND
the exponential growth of gigantic biological data from various sources, such as protein-protein interaction , genome sequences scaffolding, mass spectrometry  molecular networking and metabolic flux, demands an efficient way for better visualization and interpretation beyond the conventional, two-dimensional visualization tools.


RESULTS
we developed a 3d cytoscape client/server  plugin, which adopted cytoscape in interpreting different types of data, and ubigraph for three-dimensional visualization. the extra dimension is useful in accommodating, visualizing, and distinguishing large-scale networks with multiple crossed connections in five case studies.


CONCLUSIONS
evaluation on several experimental data using 3dscapecs and its special features, including multilevel graph layout, time-course data animation, and parallel visualization has proven its usefulness in visualizing complex data and help to make insightful conclusions.
