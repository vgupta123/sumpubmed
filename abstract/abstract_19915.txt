BACKGROUND
the tumor suppressor dlc <dig>  participates in cell signaling at the mitochondrial membrane. dlc <dig> is characterized by a sam  domain, a rho gtpase activating protein  domain, and a start lipid transfer domain.


RESULTS
towards understanding the function of dlc <dig>  we have solved the nmr solution structure of the sam domain. the dlc2-sam domain structure reveals an atypical four-helix composition that is distinct from the five-helix sam domain structures that have been determined to date. from structural alignments, helix  <dig> of the canonical sam domain appears to be replaced by shorter, extended secondary structure that follows a similar path. another difference is demonstrated by helices  <dig> and  <dig> that form a helical hairpin that is situated approximately parallel to the canonical helix  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the dlc2-sam domain adopts a structure that is topologically more similar to an anti-parallel four-helix bundle than a canonical sam domain. this alternate topology may allow the dlc2-sam domain to interact with a novel set of ligands.
