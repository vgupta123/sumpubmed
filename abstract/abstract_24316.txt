BACKGROUND
mammalian oocytes acquire competence to be fertilized during meiotic maturation. the protein kinase cdc <dig> plays a pivotal role in several key maturation events, in part through controlled changes in cdc <dig> localization. although cdc <dig> is involved in initiation of maturation, a detailed analysis of cdc <dig> localization at the onset of maturation is lacking. in this study, the subcellular distribution of cdc <dig> and its regulatory proteins cyclin b and spdy in combination with several organelle markers at the onset of pig oocyte maturation has been investigated.


RESULTS
our results demonstrate that cdc <dig> transiently associates with a single domain, identified as a cluster of endoplasmic reticulum  exit sites  by the presence of sec <dig>  in the cortex of maturing porcine oocytes prior to germinal vesicle break down. inhibition of meiosis resumption by forskolin treatment prevented translocation of cdc <dig> to this eres cluster. phosphorylated gm <dig> , which is a marker for fragmented golgi, localized to eres in almost all immature oocytes and was not affected by forskolin treatment. after removal of forskolin from the culture media, the transient translocation of cdc <dig> to eres was accompanied by a transient dispersion of p-gm <dig> into the er suggesting a role for cdc <dig> in redistributing golgi components that have collapsed into eres further into the er during meiosis. finally, we show that spdy, rather than cyclin b, colocalizes with cdc <dig> at eres, suggesting a role for the cdc2/spdy complex in regulating the secretory pathway during oocyte maturation.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate the presence of a novel structure in the cortex of porcine oocytes that comprises eres and transiently accumulates cdc <dig> prior to germinal vesicle breakdown. in addition, we show that spdy, but not cyclin b, localizes to this eres cluster together with cdc <dig>
