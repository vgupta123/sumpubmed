BACKGROUND
the availability of whole-genome sequences allows for the identification of the entire set of protein coding genes as well as their regulatory regions. this can be accomplished using multiple complementary methods that include ests, homology searches and ab initio gene predictions. previously, the genie gene-finding algorithm was trained on a small set of chlamydomonas genes and shown to improve the accuracy of gene prediction in this species compared to other available programs. to improve ab initio gene finding in chlamydomonas, we assemble a new training set consisting of over  <dig>  cdnas by assembling over  <dig>  chlamydomonas est entries in genbank using the est assembly tool pasa.


RESULTS
the prediction accuracy of our cdna-trained gene-finder, greengenie <dig>  attains 83% sensitivity and 83% specificity for exons on short-sequence predictions. we predict about  <dig>  genes in the version v <dig> chlamydomonas genome assembly, most of which  are either identical to or significantly overlap the published catalog of chlamydomonas genes  <cit> . 22% of the published catalog is absent from the greengenie <dig> predictions; there is also a fraction  of greengenie <dig> predictions that are absent from the published gene catalog. randomly chosen gene models were tested by rt-pcr and most support the greengenie <dig> predictions.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that training with est assemblies is highly effective and that greengenie <dig> is a valuable, complementary tool for predicting genes in chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
