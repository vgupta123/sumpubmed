BACKGROUND
streptococcus uberis is a common cause of bovine mastitis and recommended control measures, based on improved milking practice, teat dipping and antibiotic treatment at drying-off, are poorly efficient against this environmental pathogen. a simple and efficient typing method would be helpful in identifying s.uberis sources, virulent strains and cow to cow transmission. the potential of mlva  for s. uberis mastitis isolates genotyping was investigated.


RESULTS
the genomic sequence of streptococcus uberis  was analyzed for potential variable number tandem repeats . twenty-five tandem repeats were identified and amplified by pcr with dna samples from  <dig> s. uberis strains. a set of seven trs were found to be polymorphic and used for mlva typing of  <dig> s. uberis isolates. a total of  <dig> mlva types were obtained with  <dig> types among  <dig> strains isolated from the milk of mastitic cows belonging to our experimental herd, and  <dig> types for  <dig> epidemiologically unrelated strains, i.e. collected in different herds and areas.


CONCLUSIONS
the mlva method can be applied to s. uberis genotyping and constitutes an interesting complement to existing typing methods. this method, which is easy to perform, low cost and can be used in routine, could facilitate investigations of the epidemiology of s. uberis mastitis in dairy cows.
