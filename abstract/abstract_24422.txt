BACKGROUND
phospholipases c  are virulence factors found in several bacteria. in mycobacterium tuberculosis  they exhibit cytotoxic effects on macrophages, but the mechanisms involved in plc-induced cell death are not fully understood. it has been reported that induction of cell necrosis by virulent mtb is coordinated by subversion of pge <dig>  an essential factor in cell membrane protection.


RESULTS
using two mtb clinical isolates carrying genetic variations in plc genes, we show that the isolate 97- <dig>  which bears plca and plcb genes, is more resistant to alveolar macrophage microbicidal activity than the isolate 97- <dig>  which has all plc genes deleted. the isolate 97- <dig> also induced higher rates of alveolar macrophage necrosis, and likewise inhibited cox- <dig> expression and pge <dig> production. to address the direct effect of mycobacterial plc on cell necrosis and pge <dig> inhibition, both isolates were treated with plc inhibitors prior to macrophage infection. interestingly, inhibition of plcs affected the ability of the isolate 97- <dig> to induce necrosis, leading to cell death rates similar to those induced by the isolate 97- <dig>  finally, pge <dig> production by mtb 97-1505-infected macrophages was restored to levels similar to those produced by 97-1200-infected cells.


CONCLUSIONS
mycobacterium tuberculosis bearing plcs genes induces alveolar macrophage necrosis, which is associated to subversion of pge <dig> production.
