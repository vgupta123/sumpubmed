BACKGROUND
the endemic seagrass posidonia oceanica  delile colonizes soft bottoms producing highly productive meadows that play a crucial role in coastal ecosystems dynamics. human activities and natural events are responsible for a widespread meadows regression; to date the identification of "diagnostic" tools to monitor conservation status is a critical issue. in this study the feasibility of a novel tool to evaluate ecological impacts on posidonia meadows has been tested. quantification of a putative stress indicator, i.e. phenols content, has been coupled to 2-d electrophoretic protein analysis of rhizome samples.


RESULTS
the overall expression pattern from posidonia rhizome was determined using a preliminary proteomic approach,  <dig> protein spots were characterized by pi and molecular weight. we found that protein expression differs in samples belonging to sites with high or low phenols:  <dig> unique protein spots are peculiar of "low phenols" and  <dig> other spots characterize "high phenols" samples.


CONCLUSIONS
posidonia showed phenols variations within the meadow, that probably reflect the heterogeneity of environmental pressures. in addition, comparison of the 2-d electrophoresis patterns allowed to highlight qualitative protein expression differences in response to these pressures. these differences may account for changes in metabolic/physiological pathways as adaptation to stress. a combined approach, based on phenols content determination and 2-d electrophoresis protein pattern, seems a promising tool to monitor posidonia meadows health state.
