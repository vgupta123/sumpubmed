BACKGROUND
the walleye pollock  and norwegian pollock  are confined to the north pacific and north atlantic oceans, respectively, and considered as distinct species within the family gadidae. we have determined the complete mtdna nucleotide sequence of two specimens of norwegian pollock and compared the sequences to that of  <dig> specimens of walleye pollock representing stocks from the sea of japan and the bering sea,  <dig> specimens of atlantic cod , and  <dig> specimens of haddock .


RESULTS
a total number of  <dig> variable positions were identified among the  <dig> pollock specimens, but no specific substitution pattern could be identified between the walleye and norwegian pollocks. phylogenetic analysis using  <dig>  homologous mtdna nucleotide positions clearly identify the norwegian pollock within the walleye pollock species cluster. furthermore, the norwegian pollock sequences were most similar to mitochondrial genotypes present in walleye pollock specimens from the sea of japan, an observation supported both by neighbor-joining, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood analyses.


CONCLUSIONS
we infer that walleye pollock and norwegian pollock represent one single species and that norwegian pollock has been recently introduced from the pacific to the atlantic oceans.
