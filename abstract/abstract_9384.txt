BACKGROUND
abortive infection  mechanisms comprise numerous strategies developed by bacteria to avoid being killed by bacteriophage . escherichia coli abis are considered as mediators of programmed cell death, which is induced by infecting phage. abis were also proposed to be stress response elements, but no environmental activation signals have yet been identified. abis are widespread in lactococcus lactis, but regulation of their expression remains an open question. we previously showed that development of abid <dig> abortive infection against phage bil <dig> depends on orf <dig>  which is expressed in mid-infection. however, molecular basis for this activation remains unclear.


RESULTS
in non-infected abid1+ cells, specific abid <dig> mrna is unstable and present in low amounts. it does not increase during abortive infection of sensitive phage. protein synthesis directed by the abid <dig> translation initiation region is also inefficient. the presence of the phage orf <dig> gene, but not its mutant abid1r allele, strongly increases abid <dig> translation efficiency. interestingly, cell growth at low temperature also activates translation of abid <dig> mrna and consequently the abid <dig> phenotype, and occurs independently of phage infection. there is no synergism between the two abid <dig> inducers. purified orf <dig> protein binds mrnas containing a secondary structure motif, identified within the translation initiation regions of abid <dig>  the mid-infection phage bil <dig> m-operon, and the l. lactis osmc gene.


CONCLUSIONS
expression of the abid <dig> gene and consequently abid <dig> phenotype is specifically translationally activated by the phage orf <dig> protein. the loss of ability to activate translation of abid <dig> mrna determines the molecular basis for phage resistance to abid <dig>  we show for the first time that temperature downshift also activates abortive infection by activation of abid <dig> mrna translation.
