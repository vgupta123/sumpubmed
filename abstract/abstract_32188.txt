BACKGROUND
in the human pathogen bacillus cereus, the expression of most extracellular virulence factors is controlled by the transcriptional activator plcr. among these virulence factors, cereolysin o  is an haemolysin belonging to the cholesterol-dependant cytolysins, a protein family extensively studied in gram-positive bacteria.


RESULTS
in the genomes of bacteria belonging to the b. cereus group, including bacillus anthracis and bacillus thuringiensis, a small gene encoding a 26-amino acid peptide was present in multicopy. one copy was always found upstream from the gene encoding clo. in b. cereus atcc  <dig>  the small gene and the clo gene are co-transcribed. transcriptional fusions showed that the three paralogues identified in this strain were expressed in a plcr-dependent manner. we propose to name these peptides spp for small plcr-regulated peptides. we show that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the deduced product of the spp genes displayed antibacterial activity.


CONCLUSIONS
the co-expression of spp, a small plcr-regulated multicopy gene with clo suggests a yet unidentified relationship between spp and the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin in bacteria belonging to the b.cereus group.
