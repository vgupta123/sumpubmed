BACKGROUND
steroid receptor coactivator  <dig> is an oncogene and a member of the src family of nuclear receptor coactivator proteins that mediate the transcriptional effects of nuclear hormone receptors as well as other transcription factors.


RESULTS
we have used protein purification and mass spectrometry to identify the 53bp <dig> tumour suppressor as a novel src3-associated protein. copurification was demonstrated using multiple antibodies, and was not dependent on dna damage suggesting that src <dig> is not directly involved in the dna damage response. however using chromatin immunoprecipitation and sirna knockdown, we have demonstrated that both src <dig> and 53bp <dig> co-occupy the same region of the brca <dig> promoter and both are required for brca <dig> expression in hela cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that both 53bp <dig> and src <dig> have a common function that converge at the brca <dig> promoter and possibly other genes important for dna repair and genomic stability.
