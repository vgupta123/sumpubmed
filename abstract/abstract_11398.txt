BACKGROUND
graves’ disease is an autoimmune thyroid disease of complex inheritance. multiple genetic susceptibility loci are thought to be involved in graves’ disease and it is therefore likely that these can be identified by genome wide association studies. this study aimed to determine if a genome wide association study, using a pooling methodology, could detect genomic loci associated with graves’ disease.


RESULTS
nineteen of the top ranking single nucleotide polymorphisms including hla-dqa <dig> and c6orf <dig>  were clustered within the major histo-compatibility complex region on chromosome 6p <dig>  with rs <dig> reaching genome wide significance . technical validation of top ranking non-major histo-compatablity complex single nucleotide polymorphisms with individual genotyping in the discovery cohort revealed four single nucleotide polymorphisms with p ≤ 10− <dig>  rs <dig> on chromosome 1q <dig> , located upstream of fcrl <dig>  showed evidence of association with graves’ disease across the discovery, replication and combined cohorts. a second single nucleotide polymorphism rs <dig> downstream of dpysl <dig> showed some evidence of association supported by finding in the replication cohort that warrants further study.


CONCLUSIONS
pooled genome wide association study identified a genetic variant upstream of fcrl <dig> as a susceptibility locus for graves’ disease in addition to those identified in the major histo-compatibility complex. a second locus downstream of dpysl <dig> is potentially a novel genetic variant in graves’ disease that requires further confirmation.
