BACKGROUND
fusarium wilt, caused by the fungal pathogen fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense tropical race  <dig> , is considered the most lethal disease of cavendish bananas in the world. the disease can be managed in the field by planting resistant cavendish plants generated by somaclonal variation. however, little information is available on the genetic basis of plant resistance to foc tr <dig>  to a better understand the defense response of resistant banana plants to the fusarium wilt pathogen, the transcriptome profiles in roots of resistant and susceptible cavendish banana challenged with foc tr <dig> were compared.


RESULTS
rna-seq analysis generated more than  <dig> million 90-bp clean pair end  reads, which were assembled into  <dig>  unigenes . based on sequence similarity searches,  <dig>   genes were identified, among which  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to gene ontology  categories and clusters of orthologous groups , respectively. searches in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway database  mapped  <dig>   unigenes to  <dig> kegg pathways. a total of  <dig>  genes were assigned to plant-pathogen interactions, including disease defense and signal transduction. digital gene expression  analysis revealed large differences in the transcriptome profiles of the foc tr4-resistant somaclonal variant and its susceptible wild-type. expression patterns of genes involved in pathogen-associated molecular pattern  recognition, activation of effector-triggered immunity , ion influx, and biosynthesis of hormones as well as pathogenesis-related  genes, transcription factors, signaling/regulatory genes, cell wall modification genes and genes with other functions were analyzed and compared. the results indicated that basal defense mechanisms are involved in the recognition of pamps, and that high levels of defense-related transcripts may contribute to foc tr <dig> resistance in banana.


CONCLUSIONS
this study generated a substantial amount of banana transcript sequences and compared the defense responses against foc tr <dig> between resistant and susceptible cavendish bananas. the results contribute to the identification of candidate genes related to plant resistance in a non-model organism, banana, and help to improve the current understanding of host-pathogen interactions.
