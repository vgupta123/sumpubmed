BACKGROUND
animal models are indispensable to understand the lipid metabolism and lipid metabolic diseases. over the last decade, the nematode caenorhabditis elegans has become a popular animal model for exploring the regulation of lipid metabolism, obesity, and obese-related diseases. however, the genomic and functional conservation of lipid metabolism from c. elegans to humans remains unknown. in the present study, we systematically analyzed genes involved in lipid metabolism in the c. elegans genome using comparative genomics.


RESULTS
we built a database containing  <dig> lipid genes from the c. elegans genome, and then assigned most of lipid genes into  <dig> different lipid metabolic pathways that were integrated into a network. over 70% of c. elegans lipid genes have human orthologs, with  <dig> of  <dig> c. elegans lipid genes being conserved in humans, mice, rats, and drosophila, of which  <dig> genes are specifically related to human metabolic diseases. moreover, rna-mediated interference  was used to disrupt the expression of  <dig> of  <dig> lipid genes with available rnai clones. we found that  <dig> genes strongly affect fat storage, development, reproduction, and other visible phenotypes,  <dig> of which have not previously been implicated in the regulation of fat metabolism and other phenotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides the first systematic genomic insight into lipid metabolism in c. elegans, supporting the use of c. elegans as an increasingly prominent model in the study of metabolic diseases.
