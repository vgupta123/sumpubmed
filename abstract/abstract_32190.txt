BACKGROUND
post-translational glycosylation of the flagellin protein is relatively common among gram-negative bacteria, and has been linked to several phenotypes, including flagellar biosynthesis and motility, biofilm formation, host immune evasion and manipulation and virulence. however to date, despite extensive physiological and genetic characterization, it has never been reported for the peritrichously flagellate enterobacteriaceae.


RESULTS
using comparative genomic approaches we analyzed  <dig>  representative genomes of enterobacteriaceae, and show that flagellin glycosylation islands are relatively common and extremely versatile among members of this family. differences in the g + c content of the fgis and the rest of the genome and the presence of mobile genetic elements provide evidence of horizontal gene transfer occurring within the fgi loci. these loci therefore encode highly variable flagellin glycan structures, with distinct sugar backbones, heavily substituted with formyl, methyl, acetyl, lipoyl and amino groups. additionally, an n-lysine methylase, flib, previously identified only in the enterobacterial pathogen salmonella enterica, is relatively common among several distinct taxa within the family. these flagellin methylase island loci , in contrast to the fgi loci, appear to be stably maintained within these diverse lineages.


CONCLUSIONS
the prevalence and versatility of flagellin modification loci, both glycosylation and methylation loci, suggests they play important biological roles among the enterobacteriaceae.
