BACKGROUND
many metazoan genomes conserve chromosome-scale gene linkage relationships  from the common ancestor of multicellular animal life  <cit> , but the biological explanation for this conservation is still unknown. double cut and join  is a simple, well-studied model of neutral genome evolution amenable to both simulation and mathematical analysis  <cit> , but as we show here, it is not sufficent to explain long-term macro-synteny conservation.


RESULTS
we examine a family of simple  extensions of dcj to identify models and choices of parameters consistent with the levels of macro- and micro-synteny conservation observed among animal genomes. our software implements a flexible strategy for incorporating genomic context into the dcj model to incorporate various types of genomic context , and is available as open source software from http://github.com/putnamlab/dcj-c.


CONCLUSIONS
a simple model of genome evolution, in which dcj moves are allowed only if they maintain chromosomal linkage among a set of constrained genes, can simultaneously account for the level of macro-synteny conservation and for correlated conservation among multiple pairs of species. simulations under this model indicate that a constraint on approximately 7% of metazoan genes is sufficient to constrain genome rearrangement to an average rate of  <dig> inversions and  <dig>  translocations per million years.
