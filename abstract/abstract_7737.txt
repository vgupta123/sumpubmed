BACKGROUND
population genetics studies based on the analysis of mtdna and mitochondrial disease studies have produced a huge quantity of sequence data and related information. these data are at present worldwide distributed in differently organised databases and web sites not well integrated among them. moreover it is not generally possible for the user to submit and contemporarily analyse its own data comparing them with the content of a given database, both for population genetics and mitochondrial disease data.


RESULTS
hmtdb is a well-integrated web-based human mitochondrial bioinformatic resource aimed at supporting population genetics and mitochondrial disease studies, thanks to a new approach based on site-specific nucleotide and aminoacid variability estimation. hmtdb consists of a database of human mitochondrial genomes, annotated with population data, and a set of bioinformatic tools, able to produce site-specific variability data and to automatically characterize newly sequenced human mitochondrial genomes. a query system for the retrieval of genomes and a web submission tool for the annotation of new genomes have been designed and will soon be implemented. the first release contains  <dig> fully annotated human mitochondrial genomes. nucleotide site-specific variability data and multialigned genomes can be downloaded. intra-human and inter-species aminoacid variability data estimated on the  <dig> coding for proteins genes of the  <dig> human genomes and  <dig> mammalian species are also available. hmtdb is freely available, upon registration, at .


CONCLUSIONS
the hmtdb project will contribute towards completing and/or refining haplogroup classification and revealing the real pathogenic potential of mitochondrial mutations, on the basis of variability estimation.
