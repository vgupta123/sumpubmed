BACKGROUND
after several years in the juvenile phase, trees undergo flowering transition to become mature  trees. this transition depends on the balanced expression of a complex network of genes that is regulated by both endogenous and environmental factors. however, relatively little is known about the molecular processes regulating flowering transition in woody plants compared with herbaceous plants.


RESULTS
comparative transcript profiling of spring shoots after self-pruning was performed on a spontaneously early flowering trifoliate orange mutant  with a short juvenile phase and the wild-type  tree by using massively parallel signature sequencing . a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> high quality reads were obtained for the wt and the mutant , respectively. interpretation of the mpss signatures revealed that the total number of transcribed genes in the mt  was larger than in the wt , suggesting that newly initiated transcription occurs in the mt. further comparison of the transcripts revealed that  <dig> genes had more than twofold expression difference in the mt compared with the wt. in addition, we identified  <dig> citrus flowering-time genes homologous with known elements of flowering-time pathways through sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. these genes are highly conserved in citrus and other species, suggesting that the functions of the related proteins in controlling reproductive development may be conserved as well.


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide a foundation for comparative gene expression studies between wt and precocious trifoliate orange. additionally, a number of candidate genes required for the early flowering process of precocious trifoliate orange were identified. these results provide new insight into the molecular processes regulating flowering time in citrus.
