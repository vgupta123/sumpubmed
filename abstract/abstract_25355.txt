BACKGROUND
the different sensory modalities temperature, pain, touch and muscle proprioception are carried by somatosensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia. study of this system is hampered by the lack of molecular markers for many of these neuronal sub-types. in order to detect genes expressed in sub-populations of somatosensory neurons, gene profiling was carried out on wild-type and trka mutant neonatal dorsal root ganglia  using sage  methodology. thermo-nociceptors constitute up to  <dig> % of the neurons in the drg. in trka mutant drgs, the nociceptor sub-class of sensory neurons is lost due to absence of nerve growth factor survival signaling through its receptor trka. thus, comparison of wild-type and trka mutants allows the identification of transcripts preferentially expressed in the nociceptor or mechano-proprioceptor subclasses, respectively.


RESULTS
our comparison revealed  <dig> genes differentially expressed between the two tissues . some of these genes, cgrp, scn10a are known markers of sensory neuron sub-types. several potential markers of sub-populations, dok <dig>  crip <dig> and grik1/glur <dig> were further analyzed by quantitative rt-pcr and double labeling with trka,-b,-c, c-ret, parvalbumin and isolectin b <dig>  known markers of drg neuron sub-types. expression of grik1/glur <dig> was restricted to the isolectin b4+ nociceptive population, while dok <dig> and crip <dig> had broader expression profiles. crip <dig> expression was however excluded from the proprioceptor sub-population.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified and characterized the detailed expression patterns of three genes in the developing drg, placing them in the context of the known major neuronal sub-types defined by molecular markers. further analysis of differentially expressed genes in this tissue promises to extend our knowledge of the molecular diversity of different cell types and forms the basis for understanding their particular functional specificities.
