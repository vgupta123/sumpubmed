BACKGROUND

taihangia rupestris, an andromonoecious plant species, bears both male and hermaphroditic flowers within the same individual. however, the establishment and development of male and hermaphroditic flowers in andromonoecious taihangia remain poorly understood, due to the limited genetic and sequence information. to investigate the potential molecular mechanism in the regulation of taihangia flower formation, we used de novo rna sequencing to compare the transcriptome profiles of male and hermaphroditic flowers at early and late developmental stages.


RESULTS
four cdna libraries, including male floral bud, hermaphroditic floral bud, male flower, and hermaphroditic flower, were constructed and sequenced by using the illumina rna-seq method. totally,  <dig> , <dig> qualified illumina reads were obtained and then assembled into  <dig>  unigenes, of which  <dig>  unigenes were annotated in the ncbi non-redundant protein database. in addition,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  unigenes were assigned into  <dig> gene ontology  functional groups,  <dig> clusters of orthologous group  categories, and  <dig> kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways, respectively. by pairwise comparison of unigene abundance between the samples, we identified  <dig>  differential expressed genes , including  <dig> transcription factors  between the male and hermaphroditic flowers. at the early developmental stage, we found  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes expressed in hermaphroditic floral buds, while  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes were detected in hermaphroditic flowers at the late developmental stage. go and kegg enrichment analyses showed that a large number of degs were associated with a wide range of functions, including cell cycle, epigenetic processes, flower development, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid pathway. finally, real-time quantitative pcr was conducted to validate the degs identified in the present study.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, transcriptome data of this rare andromonoecious taihangia were reported for the first time. comparative transcriptome analysis revealed the significant differences in gene expression profiles between male and hermaphroditic flowers at early and late developmental stages. the transcriptome data of taihangia would be helpful to improve the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms in regulation of flower formation and unisexual flower establishment in andromonoecious plants.
