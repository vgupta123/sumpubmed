BACKGROUND
little is known about expression and function of the somatostatinergic system in the mammalian cochlea. we have previously shown that somatostatin administration may have a protective effect on gentamicin-induced hair cell loss. in this study, we have analyzed the cochlear expression of somatostatin receptor  <dig>  and somatostatin receptor  <dig>  at both the mrna and the protein level in wild-type mice, as well as in sst <dig> and sst <dig> knock-out  mice and in cultivated neurosensory cells.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that the somatostatin receptors sst <dig> and sst <dig> are specifically expressed in outer and inner hair cells  of the organ of corti , as well as in defined supporting cells. the expression of sst <dig> and sst <dig> receptors in cultivated p <dig> mouse oc explants was similar to their expression in inner and outer hair cells. somatostatin itself was not expressed in the mammalian cochlea, suggesting that somatostatin reaches its receptors either through the blood-labyrinthine barrier from the systemic circulation or via the endolymphatic duct from the endolymphatic sac. we used mice with a deletion of either sst <dig> or sst <dig> to learn more about the regulation of sst <dig> and sst <dig> receptor expression. we demonstrate that in sst <dig> ko mice, sst <dig> was expressed in outer hcs and deiters' cells, but not in pillar cells or inner hcs, as compared with wild-type mice. in contrast, in sst <dig> ko mice, the expression pattern of the sst <dig> receptor was not altered relative to wild-type mice.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings reveal that somatostatin receptors demonstrate specific expression in hcs and supporting cells of the mouse cochlea, and that absence of sst <dig> alters the expression of sst <dig>  this specific expression pattern suggests that somatostatin receptors may have important functional roles in the inner ear.
