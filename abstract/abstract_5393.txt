BACKGROUND
copy number variations  are important and widely distributed in the genome. cnv detection opens a new avenue for exploring genes associated with complex traits in humans, animals and plants. herein, we present a genome-wide assessment of cnvs that are potentially associated with milk composition traits in dairy cattle.


RESULTS
in this study, cnvs were detected based on whole genome re-sequencing data of eight holstein bulls from four half- and/or full-sib families, with extremely high and low estimated breeding values  of milk protein percentage and fat percentage. the range of coverage depth per individual was  <dig> – <dig> ×. using cnvnator, we identified a total of  <dig>  cnvs, including  <dig> duplications and  <dig> deletions. among them,  <dig> differential cnv regions  comprising ~ <dig>  mb of the cattle genome were observed between the high and low groups. annotation of these differential cnvrs were performed based on the cattle genome reference assembly  and totally  <dig> functional genes were found within the cnvrs. by gene ontology and kegg pathway analyses, we found that genes were significantly enriched for specific biological functions related to protein and lipid metabolism, insulin/igf pathway-protein kinase b signaling cascade, prolactin signaling pathway and ampk signaling pathways. these genes included ins, igf <dig>  foxo <dig>  th, scd <dig>  galnt <dig>  galnt <dig>  art <dig>  snca and wnt7a, implying their potential association with milk protein and fat traits. in addition,  <dig> cnvrs were overlapped with  <dig> known qtls that are associated with milk protein and fat traits of dairy cattle .


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, based on ngs of  <dig> holstein bulls with extremely high and low ebvs for milk pp and fp, we identified a total of  <dig>  cnvs,  <dig> differential cnvrs between groups, and  <dig> genes, which were suggested as promising candidate genes for milk protein and fat traits.
