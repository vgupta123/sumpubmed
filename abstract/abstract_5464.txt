BACKGROUND
matrix metalloproteinases  are members of the superfamily of zn2+ dependent extracellular or membrane-bound endopeptidases which have been implicated to play critical roles in vertebrate development and human pathogenesis. a number of mmp genes have been found to be upregulated in some or all organs during frog metamorphosis, suggesting that different mmps may have different functions in various organs/tissues. the recent advances in est  sequencing and the completion of the genome of xenopus  tropicalis prompted us to systematically analyze the existence of mmps in the xenopus genome.


RESULTS
we examined x. laevis and x. tropicalis ests and genomic sequences for mmps and obtained likely homologs for  <dig> out of the  <dig> mmps known in higher vertebrates. four of the five missing mmps, i.e. mmps  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were all encoded on human chromosome  <dig> and the other missing mmp, mmp <dig> , was also absent in human genome. in addition, we identified several novel mmps which appears to be derived from unique duplications over evolution, are present in the genomes of both xenopus species.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified the homologs of most of the mammalian mmps in xenopus and discovered a number of novel mmps. our results suggest that mmp genes undergo dynamic changes over evolution. it will be of interest in the future to investigate whether mmp expression and functions during vertebrate development are conserved. the sequence information reported here should facilitate such an endeavor in the near future.
