BACKGROUND
almost all cells display circadian rhythms, approximately 24-hour period changes in their biochemistry, physiology or behavior. these rhythms are orchestrated by an endogenous circadian clock whose mechanism is based on transcription-translation feedback loops  where the translated products of clock genes act to inhibit their own transcription.


RESULTS
we have used rna-seq to measure the abundance of all transcripts in an rna-seq-derived de novo gene catalog in two different experiments. one compared midday and midnight in a light–dark cycle  and under constant light . the second compared four different times  under a light dark cycle. we show here that despite an elaborate repertoire of biological rhythms, the unicellular dinoflagellate lingulodinium had no detectable daily variation in the abundance of any transcript in an rna-seq-derived de novo gene catalog. we also examined the timing of the bioluminescence and photosynthesis rhythms in the presence of the transcription inhibitors actinomycin d and cordycepin. we found that the timing of the two rhythms was unchanged even when transcription rates had decreased to roughly 5% the levels of untreated cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the lack of detectable daily variation in transcript levels indicates that the endogenous circadian timer of lingulodinium does not require rhythmic rna. if the circadian timer is considered as a limit cycle oscillator, then cellular time in this organism must be defined by variations in state variables that do not include the amount of a clock gene transcript.
