BACKGROUND
nuclear transport factor  <dig> and small gtpase ran participate in the nucleo-cytoplasm transport of macromolecules, but their function in the 20-hydroxyecdysone  signal transduction pathway are not well known.


RESULTS
a  <dig> bp encoding ntf <dig> and a  <dig> bp encoding ran full-length cdnas were cloned from helicoverpa armigera, and named ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran, respectively. northern blot and immunoblotting revealed that ha-ntf <dig> had an obviously higher expression levels in the head-thorax and integument of the metamorphically committed larvae. in contrast, the expression of ha-ran did not show obvious variation at various developmental stages in four tissues by immunoblotting analysis, except in the midgut, which showed increased expression from 5th- <dig> h  to 6th- <dig> h. both expressions of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran could be upregulated by 20e in vitro. immunohistochemistry revealed that ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran were primarily localized in the nucleus of various tissues. protein binding assay and co-immunoprecipitation indicated that ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran can combine with each other in vitro and in vivo. knock down of ha-ntf <dig> or ha-ran by rnai resulted in the suppression of other 20e regulated genes including ecr-b <dig>  usp <dig>  e75b, br-cz <dig>  hhr <dig> and ha-eif5c. in addition, the knockdown of ha-ntf <dig> resulted in ha-ran being prevented in the cytoplasm. the nuclear location of the ecdysone receptor b <dig>  was also blocked after the knockdown of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran.


CONCLUSIONS
these evidences suggested that ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran participated in the 20e signal transduction pathway by regulating the location of ecr-b <dig>
