BACKGROUND
krüppel-like factor  <dig>  plays an important role in vessel maturation during embryonic development. in adult mice, klf <dig> regulates expression of the tight junction protein occludin, which may allow klf <dig> to maintain vascular integrity. adult tamoxifen-inducible krüppel-like factor  <dig>  knockout mice have thickened arterial intima following vascular injury. the role of klf <dig>  and the possible overlapping functions of klf <dig> and klf <dig>  in the developing vasculature are not well-studied.


RESULTS
endothelial breaks are observed in a major vessel, the primary head vein , in klf2-/-klf4-/- embryos at e <dig> . klf2-/-klf4-/- embryos die by e <dig> , which is earlier than either single knockout. gross hemorrhaging of multiple vessels may be the cause of death. e <dig>  klf2-/-klf4+/- embryos do not exhibit gross hemorrhaging, but cross-sections display disruptions of the endothelial cell layer of the phv, and these embryos generally also die by e <dig> . electron micrographs confirm that there are gaps in the phv endothelial layer in e <dig>  klf2-/-klf4-/- embryos, and show that the endothelial cells are abnormally bulbous compared to klf2-/- and wild-type . the amount of endothelial nitric oxide synthase  mrna, which encodes an endothelial regulator, is reduced by 10-fold in e <dig>  klf2-/-klf4-/- compared to klf2-/- and wt embryos. vegfr <dig>  an enos inducer, and occludin, a tight junction protein, gene expression are also reduced in e <dig>  klf2-/-klf4-/- compared to klf2-/- and wt embryos.


CONCLUSIONS
this study begins to define the roles of klf <dig> and klf <dig> in the embryonic development of blood vessels. it indicates that the two genes interact to maintain an intact endothelial layer. klf <dig> and klf <dig> positively regulate the enos, vegfr <dig> and occludin genes. down-regulation of these genes in klf2-/-klf4-/- embryos may result in the observed loss of vascular integrity.
