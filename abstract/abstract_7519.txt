BACKGROUND
cancer is commonly associated with widespread disruption of dna methylation, chromatin modification and mirna expression. in this study, we established a robust discovery pipeline to identify epigenetically deregulated mirnas in cancer.


RESULTS
using an integrative approach that combines primary transcription, genome-wide dna methylation and h3k9ac marks with microrna  expression, we identified mirna genes that were epigenetically modified in cancer. we find mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir-196b to be epigenetically repressed, and mir- <dig> epigenetically activated in prostate cancer cells.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that detecting changes in primary mirna transcription levels is a valuable method for detection of local epigenetic modifications that are associated with changes in mature mirna expression.
