BACKGROUND
mcm <dig> protein is essential for initiation and elongation phases of replication. human cells proteolyze mcm <dig> during mitosis, presumably to ensure a single round of replication. it has been proposed that anaphase promoting complex ubiquitinates mcm <dig> in late m and early g <dig> phases.


RESULTS
in contrast to the previous work, we report that the degradation of mcm <dig> is initiated at the onset of mitosis. immunoblotting and immunofluorescence assays display that mcm <dig> levels are low in all phases of mitosis. we report that mcm <dig> degradation is not dependent on anaphase promoting complex. further, the proteolysis in m-phase can be independently mediated by non-overlapping regions of mcm <dig>  apparently employing a redundant mechanism to ensure downregulation.


CONCLUSIONS
it is believed that the proteolysis of mcm <dig> during mitosis is a vital mechanism to prevent aberrant initiation of replication and the present study describes the regulation of mcm <dig> during this phase of the cell-cycle.
