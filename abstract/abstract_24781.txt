BACKGROUND
immune traits  are potentially relevant criteria to characterize an individual’s immune response. our aim was to investigate whether the peripheral blood transcriptome can provide a significant and comprehensive view of it variations in pig.


RESULTS
sixty-day-old large white pigs classified as extreme for in vitro production of il <dig>  il <dig>  ifnγ and tnfα, phagocytosis activity, in vivo cd4-/cd8+ or tcrγδ + cell counts, and anti-mycoplasma antibody levels were chosen to perform a blood transcriptome analysis with a porcine generic array enriched with immunity-related genes. differentially expressed  genes for in vitro production of il <dig> and il <dig>  phagocytosis activity and cd4-/cd8+ cell counts were identified. gene set enrichment analysis revealed a significant over-representation of immune response functions. to validate the microarray-based results, a subset of de genes was confirmed by rt-qpcr. an independent set of  <dig> animals was used to validate the covariation between gene expression levels and its. five potential gene biomarkers were found for prediction of il <dig> , phagocytosis  or cd4-/cd8+ cell count . on average, these biomarkers performed with a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 86%.


CONCLUSIONS
our results confirmed that gene expression profiling in blood represents a relevant molecular phenotype to refine its in pig and to identify potential biomarkers that can provide new insights into immune response analysis.
