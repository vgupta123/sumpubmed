BACKGROUND
lactose, as the primary osmotic component in milk, is the major determinant of milk volume. glucose is the primary precursor of lactose. however, the effect of glucose on lactose synthesis in dairy cow mammary glands and the mechanism governing this process are poorly understood.


RESULTS
here we showed that glucose has the ability to induce lactose synthesis in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells, as well as increase cell viability and proliferation. a concentration of 12 mm glucose was the optimum concentration to induce cell growth and lactose synthesis in cultured dairy cow mammary epithelial cells. in vitro, 12 mm glucose enhanced lactose content, along with the expression of genes involved in glucose transportation and the lactose biosynthesis pathway, including glut <dig>  slc35a <dig>  slc35b <dig>  hk <dig>  β4galt-i, and akt <dig>  in addition, we found that akt <dig> knockdown inhibited cell growth and lactose synthesis as well as expression of glut <dig>  slc35a <dig>  slc35b <dig>  hk <dig>  and β4galt-i.


CONCLUSIONS
glucose induces cell growth and lactose synthesis in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells. protein kinase b alpha acts as a regulator of metabolism in dairy cow mammary gland to mediate the effects of glucose on lactose synthesis.
