BACKGROUND
cytoplasmic male sterility  is not only important for exploiting heterosis in crop plants, but also as a model for investigating nuclear-cytoplasmic interaction. cms may be caused by mutations, rearrangement or recombination in the mitochondrial genome. understanding the mitochondrial genome is often the first and key step in unraveling the molecular and genetic basis of cms in plants. comparative analysis of the mitochondrial genome of the hau cms line and its maintainer line in b. juneca  may help show the origin of the cms-associated gene orf <dig> 


RESULTS
through next-generation sequencing, the b. juncea hau cms mitochondrial genome was assembled into a single, circular-mapping molecule that is  <dig>  bp in size and  <dig> % in gc content. in addition to the cms associated gene orf <dig>  the genome contains  <dig> protein-encoding genes,  <dig> rrnas,  <dig> trna genes and  <dig> orfs of unknown function. the mitochondrial genome sizes of the maintainer line and another normal type line “j163-4” are both  <dig>  bp and with gc content at  <dig> %. the maintainer line has  <dig> genes with protein products,  <dig> rrnas,  <dig> trna genes and  <dig> unidentified orfs. comparative analysis the mitochondrial genomes of the hau cms line and its maintainer line allowed us to develop specific markers to separate the two lines at the seedling stage. we also confirmed that different mitotypes coexist substoichiometrically in hau cms lines and its maintainer lines in b. juncea. the number of repeats larger than  <dig> bp in the hau cms line  are nearly twice of those found in the maintainer line . phylogenetic analysis of the cms-associated gene orf <dig> and four other homologous sequences in brassicaceae show that orf <dig> was clearly different from orf <dig> in brassica tournefortii despite of strong similarity.


CONCLUSIONS
the hau cms mitochondrial genome was highly rearranged when compared with its iso-nuclear maintainer line mitochondrial genome. this study may be useful for studying the mechanism of natural cms in b. juncea, performing comparative analysis on sequenced mitochondrial genomes in brassicas, and uncovering the origin of the hau cms mitotype and structural and evolutionary differences between different mitotypes.
