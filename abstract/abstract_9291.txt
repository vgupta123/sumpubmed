BACKGROUND
the brassica b genome is known to carry several important traits, yet there has been limited analyses of its underlying genome structure, especially in comparison to the closely related a and c genomes. a bacterial artificial chromosome  library of brassica nigra was developed and screened with  <dig> genes from a 222Â kb region of a. thaliana that had been well characterised in both the brassica a and c genomes.


RESULTS
fingerprinting of  <dig> apparently non-redundant clones defined physical contigs for the corresponding regions in b. nigra. the target region is duplicated in a. thaliana and six homologous contigs were found in b. nigra resulting from the whole genome triplication event shared by the brassiceae tribe. bacs representative of each region were sequenced to elucidate the level of microscale rearrangements across the brassica species divide.


CONCLUSIONS
although the b genome species separated from the a/c lineage some  <dig> mya, comparisons between the three paleopolyploid brassica genomes revealed extensive conservation of gene content and sequence identity. the level of fractionation or gene loss varied across genomes and genomic regions; however, the greatest loss of genes was observed to be common to all three genomes. one large-scale chromosomal rearrangement differentiated the b genome suggesting such events could contribute to the lack of recombination observed between b genome species and those of the closely related a/c lineage.
