BACKGROUND
microinjection of clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat /crispr-associated protein  <dig> -related rna and dna into fertilized eggs is a novel approach for creating gene-modified mice. blastocysts obtained just before implantation may be appropriate for testing the fidelity of cripsr/cas9-mediated genome editing because they can be individually handled in vitro and obtained 3 days after microinjection, thus allowing researchers to check mutations rapidly. however, it is not known whether indel mutations caused by the crispr/cas <dig> system can be reproducibly detected in embryos. in this study, we assessed the detection of crispr/cas9-induced mutations in embryos.


RESULTS
t <dig> endonuclease i was more effective than surveyor nuclease for detecting mutations in annealed fragments derived from  <dig> plasmids, which contained nearly identical sequences. mouse fertilized eggs were microinjected with crispr/cas9-related rna/dna to examine whether non-homologous end joining-mediated knockout and homologous recombination-mediated knockin occurred in the endogenous receptor  activity modifying protein  <dig>  gene. individual blastocysts were lysed to obtain crude dna solutions, which were used for polymerase chain reaction  assays. t <dig> endonuclease i-based pcr and sequencing analysis demonstrated that 25–100% of the embryos were knockout embryos and 7–57% of the embryos were knockin embryos. our results also established that crude dna from a single blastocyst was an appropriate template for whole genome amplification and subsequent assessment by pcr and the t <dig> endonuclease i-based assay.


CONCLUSIONS
the single blastocyst-based assay was useful for determining whether crispr/cas9-mediated genome editing worked in murine embryos.
