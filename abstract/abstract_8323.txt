BACKGROUND
revolver is a newly discovered multi-gene family of transposable elements in the triticeae genome. revolver encompasses  <dig> to  <dig> bp, has  <dig> bp of terminal inverted repeated sequences at both ends, and contains a transcriptionally active gene encoding a dna-binding-like protein. a putative tata box is located at base  <dig>  with a cap site at base  <dig> and a possible polyadenylation signal aataaa at base  <dig>  revolver shows considerable quantitative variation in wheat and its relatives.


RESULTS
revolver cdnas varied between  <dig> and  <dig>  bp in length. the first exon exhibited length variation, but the second and third exons were almost identical. these variants in the revolver family shared the downstream region of the second intron, but varied structurally at the 5' first exon. there were  <dig> clones, which showed partial homology to revolver, among  <dig>  expressed sequence tagged  clones sourced from triticeae. in these revolver homologues with lengths of 360- <dig> bp, the portion after the 2nd exon was conserved , but the 1st exon sequences had mutually low homology, with mutations classified into  <dig> types, and did not have est sequences with open reading frames . by pcr with the 3'-flanking region of a typical genomic clone of revolver- <dig> used as a single primer, rye chromosomes 1r and 5r could be simultaneously identified. extensive eco-geographic diversity and divergence was observed among  <dig> genotypes of the single species triticum dicoccoides collected from  <dig> populations in israel with varying exposures to abiotic and biotic stresses .


CONCLUSIONS
on the base of existing differences between revolver variants, the molecular markers that can distinguish different rye chromosomes were developed. eco-geographic diversification of wild emmer t. dicoccoides in israel and high revolver copy numbers are associated with higher rainfall and biotic stresses. the remarkable quantitative differences among copy numbers of revolver in the same species from different ecosystems suggest strong amplification activity within the last  <dig>  years. it is the interesting finding because the majority of triticeae high-copy transposable elements seem to be inactive at the recent time except for bare- <dig> element in hordeum and the fact might be interesting to perceive the processes of plant adaptive evolution.
