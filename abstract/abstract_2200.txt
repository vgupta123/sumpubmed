BACKGROUND
nowadays, the focus in metabolic engineering research is shifting from massive overexpression and inactivation of genes towards the model-based fine tuning of gene expression. in this context, the construction of a library of synthetic promoters of escherichia coli as a useful tool for fine tuning gene expression is discussed here.


RESULTS
a degenerated oligonucleotide sequence that encodes consensus sequences for e. coli promoters separated by spacers of random sequences has been designed and synthesized. this  <dig> bp long sequence contains  <dig> conserved,  <dig> semi-conserved  and  <dig> random nucleotides. this mixture of dna fragments was cloned into a promoter probing vector . the ligation mixtures were transformed into competent e. coli ma <dig> and the resulting clones were screened for gfp activity by measuring the relative fluorescence units; some clones produced high fluorescence intensity, others weak fluorescence intensity. the clones cover a range of promoter activities from  <dig>  rfu/od <dig> ml to  <dig>  rfu/od <dig> ml.  <dig> promoters were sequenced and used for promoter analysis. the present results conclusively show that the postulates, which link promoter strength to anomalies in the - <dig> box and/or - <dig> box, and to the length of the spacer, are not generally valid. however, by applying partial least squares regression, a model describing the promoter strength was built and validated.


CONCLUSIONS
for escherichia coli, the promoter strength can not been linked to anomalies in the - <dig> box and/or - <dig> box, and to the length of the spacer. also a probabilistic approach to relate the promoter sequence to its strength has some drawbacks. however, by applying partial least squares regression, a good correlation was found between promoter sequence and promoter strength. this pls model can be a useful tool to rationally design a suitable promoter in order to fine tune gene expression.
