BACKGROUND
diabetic nephropathy  is a major complication of type <dig> and type  <dig> diabetes. understanding how diabetes regulate transcriptome dynamics in dn is important for understanding the biology of the disease and for guiding development of new treatments.


RESULTS
we analyzed the kidney transcriptome of a dn mouse model, d <dig> b6-ins2
akita/matbj, before/after treatment with p78-pedf. age, weight, and gender-matched mice and wild-type  littermates were treated at 6 weeks  or 12 weeks  of age for the duration of 6 weeks. animals were implanted with an osmotic mini pump delivering  <dig>  ug/g/day p78-pedf or vehicle. using rna-seq, we identified <dig>  transcripts  that were significant and reliably expressed  in diabetic kidneys. expression of  <dig>   including  <dig> coding genes was altered by diabetes with log <dig> fold changes  between - <dig>  and + <dig>   compared to wt. of these,  <dig>  showed increased and  <dig>  decreased expression with fc >  <dig> . coding genes with highest fc in diabetic kidneys include nhej <dig> , ept <dig> , srd5a <dig> , aif <dig> , and angptl <dig> .

early and late stage diabetic groups receiving continuous infusion of p <dig> showed altered expression of 316/ <dig>   transcripts, including  <dig> coding genes compared to non-treated diabetic controls. of these,  <dig> were upregulated and  <dig> downregulated with fc + <dig> –- <dig>  . p <dig> reversed diabetes-induced changes in 138/ <dig>  transcripts, including 49/ <dig>  coding genes. nhej <dig> , tceanc <dig> , ept <dig> , ugt1a <dig> , and tmsb15l  showed the highest fc with treatment. the dna repair gene, nhej <dig> with the greatest fc in diabetic kidneys was completely restored to control levels by both early and late p <dig> treatments. expression of other coding genes regulated by diabetes with fc > =  <dig>  and completely reversed by p <dig> include mamdc <dig>  kdm4b, tmem <dig>  selm, and hpd. rt and qrt-pcr validated expression of gene with fc >  <dig> . transcriptome changes were also observed between early and late-stage treatments.

precursor non-coding mirnas showed the highest fold changes in expression in the diabetic and p <dig> treatment groups. several diabetic-induced changes were reversed in direction of expression by treatment including gm <dig>  gm <dig>  mir <dig>  gm <dig>  gm <dig>  and mir196a <dig> with fc > = <dig> 

from ingenuity pathway analysis , mitochondrial dysfunction, nrf-2- mediated oxidative stress and renal injury pathways emerged as key mechanisms in dn. dn-enriching genes in these pathways were reduced in number or regulated in the opposite direction by treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
unique biomarkers and canonical pathways identified in this study may hold the key to understanding mechanisms of dn pathobiology with value for clinical translation. our data suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction, genotoxicity and oxidative stress are principal events in dn and that p78-pedf holds promise for its management.
