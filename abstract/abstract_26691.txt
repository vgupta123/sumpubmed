BACKGROUND
coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular bacterium and the etiologic agent of q fever; both coxiella outer membrane protein  <dig>  and heat shock protein b  are its major immunodominant antigens. it is not clear whether com <dig> and hspb have the ability to mount immune responses against c. burnetii infection.


RESULTS
the recombinant proteins com <dig> and hspb were applied to pulse human monocyte-derived dendritic cells , and the pulsed hmdcs were used to stimulate isogenic t cells. com1-pulsed hmdcs expressed substantially higher levels of surface molecules  and a higher level of interleukin- <dig> than hspb-pulsed hmdcs. moreover, com1-pulsed hmdcs induced high-level proliferation and activation of cd4+ and cd8+ cells, which expressed high levels of t-cell activation marker cd <dig> and inflammatory cytokines ifn-γ and tnf-α. in contrast, hspb-pulsed hmdcs were unable to induce efficient t-cell proliferation and activation.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that com1-pulsed hmdcs are able to induce efficient t-cell proliferation and drive t cells toward th <dig> and tc <dig> polarization; however, hspb-pulsed hmdcs are unable to do so. unlike hspb, com <dig> is a protective antigen, which was demonstrated by the adoptive transfer of com1-pulsed bone marrow dendritic cells into naive balb/c mice.
