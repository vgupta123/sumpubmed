BACKGROUND
spic encoded within salmonella pathogenicity island  <dig> on the salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium chromosome is required for survival within macrophages and systemic infection in mice. additionally, spic contributes to salmonella-induced activation of the signal transduction pathways in macrophages by affecting the expression of flic, a component of flagella filaments. here, we show the contribution of spic in flagellum synthesis.


RESULTS
quantitative rt-pcr shows that the expression levels of the class  <dig> flid and mota genes that encode for the flagella cap and motor torque proteins, respectively, were lower for a spic mutant strain than for the wild-type salmonella. further, this mutant had lower expression levels of the class  <dig> genes including the flia gene encoding the flagellar-specific alternative sigma factor. we also found differences in flagella assembly between the wild-type strain and the spic mutant. many flagella filaments were observed on the bacterial surface of the wild-type strain, whereas the spic mutant had only few flagella. the absence of spic led to reduced expression of the flhd protein, which functions as the master regulator in flagella gene expression, although no significant difference at the transcription level of the flhdc operon was observed between the wild-type strain and the spic mutant.


CONCLUSIONS
the data show that spic is involved in flagella assembly by affecting the post-transcription expression of flhdc.
