BACKGROUND
small-secreted peptides are emerging as important components in cell-cell communication during basic developmental stages of plant cell growth and development. plant peptide containing sulfated tyrosine  <dig>  has been reported to promote cell expansion and differentiation in the elongation zone of roots. psy <dig> action is dependent on a receptor psy1r that triggers a signaling cascade leading to cell elongation. however little is known about cellular functions and the components involved in psy1-based signaling cascade.


RESULTS
differentially expressed genes were identified in a wild type plant line and in a psy1r receptor mutant line of arabidopsis thaliana after treatment with psy <dig>  seventy-seven genes were found to be responsive to the psy <dig> peptide in wild type plants while  <dig> genes were responsive in the receptor mutant plants. psy <dig> activates the transcripts of genes involved in cell wall modification. gene enrichment analysis revealed that psy1-responsive genes are involved in responses to stimuli, metabolic processes and biosynthetic processes. the significant enrichment terms of psy1-responsive genes were higher in psy1r mutant plants compared to in wild type plants. two parallel responses to psy <dig> were identified, differing in their dependency on the psy1r receptor. promoter analysis of the differentially expressed genes identified a light regulatory motif in some of these.


CONCLUSIONS
psy1-responsive genes are involved in cellular functions and stimuli responses suggesting a crosstalk between developmental cues and environmental stimuli. possibly, two parallel responses to psy <dig> exist. a motif involved in light regulation was identified in the promoter region of the differentially expressed genes. reduced hypocotyl growth was observed in etiolated receptor mutant seedlings.
