BACKGROUND
the use of reverse engineering methods to infer gene regulatory networks by fitting mathematical models to gene expression data is becoming increasingly popular and successful. however, increasing model complexity means that more powerful global optimisation techniques are required for model fitting. the parallel lam simulated annealing  algorithm has been used in such approaches, but recent research has shown that island evolutionary strategies can produce faster, more reliable results. however, no parallel island evolutionary strategy  has yet been demonstrated to be effective for this task.


RESULTS
here, we present synchronous and asynchronous versions of the pies algorithm, and apply them to a real reverse engineering problem: inferring parameters in the gap gene network. we find that the asynchronous pies exhibits very little communication overhead, and shows significant speed-up for up to  <dig> nodes: the pies running on  <dig> nodes is nearly  <dig> times faster than the best serial algorithm. we compare the asynchronous pies to plsa on the same test problem, measuring the time required to reach particular levels of residual error, and show that it shows much faster convergence than plsa across all optimisation conditions tested.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that the pies is consistently faster and more reliable than the plsa algorithm on this problem, and scales better with increasing numbers of nodes. in addition, the pies is especially well suited to further improvements and adaptations: firstly, the algorithm's fast initial descent speed and high reliability make it a good candidate for being used as part of a global/local search hybrid algorithm. secondly, it has the potential to be used as part of a hierarchical evolutionary algorithm, which takes advantage of modern multi-core computing architectures.
