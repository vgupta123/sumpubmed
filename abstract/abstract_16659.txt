BACKGROUND
enterobacteriaceae diversified from an ancestral lineage ~300- <dig> million years ago  into a wide variety of free-living and host-associated lifestyles. nutrient availability varies across niches, and evolution of metabolic networks likely played a key role in adaptation.


RESULTS
here we use a paleo systems biology approach to reconstruct and model metabolic networks of ancestral nodes of the enterobacteria phylogeny to investigate metabolism of ancient microorganisms and evolution of the networks. specifically, we identified orthologous genes across genomes of  <dig> free-living enterobacteria , and constructed core metabolic networks capturing conserved components for ancestral lineages leading to e. coli/shigella , e. coli/shigella/salmonella , and all enterobacteria . using these models we analyzed the capacity for carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur, and iron utilization in aerobic and anaerobic conditions, identified conserved and differentiating catabolic phenotypes, and validated predictions by comparison to experimental data from extant organisms.


CONCLUSIONS
this is a novel approach using quantitative ancestral models to study metabolic network evolution and may be useful for identification of new targets to control infectious diseases caused by enterobacteria.
