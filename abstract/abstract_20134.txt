BACKGROUND
interferon induced tetratricopeptide repeat protein  <dig>  belongs to the type i interferon response genes and is highly induced after stimulation with lps. the biological function of this protein is so far unclear. previous studies indicated that ifit- <dig> binds to the initiation factor subunit eif-3c, affects translation initiation and inhibits protein synthesis. the aim of the study was to further characterize the function of ifit- <dig> 


RESULTS
stimulation of raw <dig>  macrophages with lps or ifn-γ leads to the expression of ifit- <dig> in a type i interferon dependent manner. by using stably transfected raw <dig>  macrophages overexpressing ifit- <dig> we found that ifit- <dig> inhibits selectively lps induced expression of tnf-α, il- <dig>  and mip- <dig> but not of ifit- <dig> or egr- <dig>  in ifit- <dig> overexpressing cells tnf-α mrna expression was lower after lps stimulation due to reduced mrna stability. further experiments suggest that characteristics of the 3'utr of transcripts discriminate whether ifit- <dig> has a strong impact on protein expression or not.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that ifit- <dig> may affect selectively lps induced protein expression probably by regulation at different posttranscriptional levels.
