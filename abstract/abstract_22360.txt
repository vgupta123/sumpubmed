BACKGROUND
enterotoxigenic escherichia coli  strains producing multiple enterotoxins are important causes of post-weaning diarrhea  in pigs. the aim of the present study was to investigate the fecal presence of etec enterotoxin as well as f <dig> and f <dig> genes as an indicator of colistin sulfate  efficacy for treatment of pwd in pigs. forty-eight piglets were weaned at the age of  <dig> days, and were divided into four groups: challenged treated, challenged untreated, unchallenged treated, and unchallenged untreated. challenge was performed using 109 cfu of an etec: f <dig> strain, and treatment was conducted using oral cs at the dose of  <dig>  iu/kg. the fecal presence of genes encoding for sta, stb, lt, f <dig> and f <dig> was detected using pcr.


RESULTS
the pcr amplification of etec virulence genes showed that nearly 100% of pigs excreted genes encoding for sta and stb toxins in the feces before the challenge. these genes, in the absence of the gene encoding f <dig>  were considered as a marker for f4-negative etec. one day after etec: f <dig> oral challenge pigs in the two challenged groups excreted the genes encoding lt and f <dig> in the feces. these genes were considered as a marker for f4-positive etec. however, the gene encoding f <dig> was not detected in any fecal samples of the  <dig> groups throughout the experiment. after only 3 days of successive oral treatment with cs, a significant reduction in both the f4-positive and negative etec populations was observed in the challenged treated group compared to the challenged untreated group .


CONCLUSIONS
our study is among the first to report that under controlled farming conditions, oral cs treatment had a significant effect on both fecal f4-positive and f4-negative etec in pigs. however, cs clinical efficiency was correlated with non-detection of f4-positive etec in the feces. furthermore the fecal presence of f4-negative etec was not associated with clinical symptoms of post-weaning diarrhea in pigs.
