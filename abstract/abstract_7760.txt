BACKGROUND
it is well known that axotomy in the neonatal period causes massive loss of motoneurons, which is reflected in the reduction of the number of motor units and the alteration in muscle properties. this type of neuronal death is attributed to the excessive activation of the ionotropic glutamate receptors . in the present study we investigated the effect of the nmda antagonist dap <dig>  in systemic administration, on muscle properties and on behavioural aspects following peripheral nerve injury.

methods
wistar rats were subjected to sciatic nerve crush on the second postnatal day. four experimental groups were included in this study: a) controls  b) crush c) dap <dig> treated and d) crush and dap <dig> treated. animals were examined with isometric tension recordings of the fast extensor digitorum longus and the slow soleus muscles, as well as with locomotor tests at four time points, at p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and adulthood .


RESULTS
 <dig>  administration of dap <dig> alone provoked no apparent adverse effects.  <dig>  in all age groups, animals with crush developed significantly less tension than the controls in both muscles and had a worse performance in locomotor tests . crush animals injected with dap <dig> were definitely improved as their tension recordings and their locomotor behaviour were significantly improved compared to axotomized ones .  <dig>  the time course of soleus contraction was not altered by axotomy and the muscle remained slow-contracting in all developmental stages in all experimental groups. edl, on the other hand, became slower after the crush . dap <dig> administration restored the contraction velocity, even up to the level of control animals  <dig>  following crush, edl becomes fatigue resistant after p <dig> . soleus, on the other hand, becomes less fatigue resistant. dap <dig> restored the profile in both muscles.


CONCLUSIONS
our results confirm that contractile properties and locomotor behaviour of animals are severely affected by axotomy, with a differential impact on fast contracting muscles. administration of dap <dig> reverses these devastating effects, without any observable side-effects. this agent could possibly show a therapeutic potential in other models of excitotoxic injury as well.
