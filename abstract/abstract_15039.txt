BACKGROUND
the inflammatory response in helicobacter pylori-infected gastric tissue is mediated by cag pathogenicity island -dependent activation of nuclear factor-κb . phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase /akt signaling is known to play a role in nf-κb activation, but little information is available on the relationship between h. pylori and pi3k/akt signaling in gastric epithelial cells. we examined whether h. pylori activates akt in gastric epithelial cells, the role of cag pai in this process and the role of akt in regulating h. pylori-induced nf-κb activation.


RESULTS
phosphorylated akt was detected in epithelial cells of h. pylori-positive gastric tissues. although akt was activated in mkn <dig> and ags cells by coculture with cag pai-positive h. pylori strains, a cag pai-negative mutant showed no activation of akt. h. pylori also induced p <dig> phosphorylation. pi3k inhibitor suppressed h. pylori-induced p <dig> phosphorylation and nf-κb transactivation, as well as interleukin- <dig> expression. furthermore, transfection with a dominant-negative akt inhibited h. pylori-induced nf-κb transactivation. transfection with small interference rnas for p <dig> and akt also inhibited h. pylori-induced interleukin- <dig> expression.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that cag pai-positive h. pylori activates akt in gastric epithelial cells and this may contribute to h. pylori-mediated nf-κb activation associated with mucosal inflammation and carcinogenesis.
