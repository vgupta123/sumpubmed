BACKGROUND
recent evidence has suggested that alzheimer’s disease -associated neuronal loss may occur via the caspase-independent route of programmed cell death  in addition to caspase-dependent mechanisms. however, the brain region specificity of caspase-independent pcd in ad-associated neurodegeneration is unknown. we therefore used the transgenic crnd <dig>  ad mouse model to explore whether the apoptosis inducing factor , a key mediator of caspase-independent pcd, contributes to cell loss in selected brain regions in the course of aging.


RESULTS
increased expression of truncated aif , which is directly responsible for cell death induction, was observed at both 4- and 6-months of age in the cortex. concomitant with the up-regulation of taif was an increase in the nuclear translocation of this protein. heightened taif expression or translocation was not observed in the hippocampus or cerebellum, which were used as ad-vulnerable and relatively ad-spared regions, respectively. the cortical alterations in taif levels were accompanied by increased bax expression and mitochondrial translocation. this effect was preceded by a significant reduction in atp content and an increase in reactive oxygen species  production, detectable at 2 months of age despite negligible amounts of amyloid-beta peptides .


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these data suggest that aif is likely to play a region-specific role in ad-related caspase-independent pcd, which is consistent with aging-associated mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress.
