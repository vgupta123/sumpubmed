BACKGROUND
arthropod-borne viruses  can persistently infect and cause limited damage to mosquito vectors. rna interference  is a mosquito antiviral response important in restricting rna virus replication and has been shown to be active against some arboviruses. the goal of this study was to use a recombinant sindbis virus  that expresses b <dig> protein of flock house virus , a protein that inhibits rnai, to determine the effects of linking arbovirus infection with rnai inhibition.


RESULTS
b <dig> protein expression from sinv  inhibited the accumulation of non-specific small rnas in aedes aegypti mosquito cell culture and virus-specific small rnas both in infected cell culture and ae. aegypti mosquitoes. more viral genomic and subgenomic rna accumulated in cells and mosquitoes infected with te/3'2j virus expressing b <dig>  compared to te/3'2j and te/3'2j virus expressing gfp. te/3'2j/b <dig> exhibited increased infection rates, dissemination rates, and infectious virus titers in mosquitoes following oral bloodmeal. following infectious oral bloodmeal, significantly more mosquitoes died when te/3'2j/b <dig> was ingested. the virus was 100% lethal following intrathoracic inoculation of multiple mosquito species and lethality was dose-dependent in ae. aegypti.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that rnai is active in ae. aegypti cell culture and that b <dig> protein inhibits rnai in mosquito cells when expressed by a recombinant sinv. also, sinv more efficiently replicates in mosquito cells when rnai is inhibited. finally, te/3'2j/b <dig> kills mosquitoes in a dose-dependent manner independent of infection route and mosquito species.
