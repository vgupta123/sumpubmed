BACKGROUND
in order to further distinguish unique from general functions of connexin <dig>  we have generated mice in which the coding region of connexin <dig> was replaced by that of connexin <dig> 


RESULTS
heterozygous mothers showed impaired mammary gland development responsible for decreased lactation and early postnatal death of the pups which could be partially rescued by wild type foster mothers. only about 17% of the homozygous connexin <dig> knock-in connexin <dig> mice instead of 25% expected according to mendelian inheritance, were born and only 6% survived to day  <dig> post partum and longer. neonatal and adult connexin <dig> knock-in connexin <dig> mice exhibited slowed ventricular conduction in their hearts, i.e. similar but delayed electrophysiological abnormalities as connexin <dig> deficient mice. furthermore, connexin <dig> knock-in connexin <dig> male and female mice were infertile and exhibited hypotrophic gonads. in testes, tubuli seminiferi were developed and spermatogonia as well as some primary spermatocytes were present, but further differentiated stages of spermatogenesis were absent. ovaries of female connexin <dig> knock-in connexin <dig> mice revealed only few follicles and the maturation of follicles was completely impaired.


CONCLUSIONS
the impaired gametogenesis of homozygous males and females can explain their infertility.
