BACKGROUND
decapentaplegic  is one of the best characterized morphogens, required for dorso-ventral patterning of the drosophila embryo and for anterior-posterior  patterning of the wing imaginal disc. in the larval wing pouch, the dpp target gene optomotor-blind  is generally assumed to be expressed in a step function above a certain threshold of dpp signaling activity.


RESULTS
we show that the transcription factor omb forms, in fact, a symmetrical gradient on both sides of the a/p compartment boundary. disruptions of the omb gradient lead to a re-organization of the epithelial cytoskeleton and to a retraction of cells toward the basal membrane suggesting that the omb gradient is required for correct epithelial morphology. moreover, by analysing the shape of omb gain- and loss-of-function clones, we find that omb promotes cell sorting along the a/p axis in a concentration-dependent manner.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings show that omb distribution in the wing imaginal disc is described by a gradient rather than a step function. graded omb expression is necessary for normal cell morphogenesis and cell affinity and sharp spatial discontinuities must be avoided to allow normal wing development.
