BACKGROUND
campylobacter jejuni is a major bacterial cause of food-borne enteritis, and its lipooligosaccharide  plays an initiating role in the development of the autoimmune neuropathy, guillain-barré syndrome, by induction of anti-neural cross-reactive antibodies through ganglioside molecular mimicry.


RESULTS
herein we describe the existence and heterogeneity of multiple los forms in c. jejuni strains of human and chicken origin grown at 37°c and 42°c, respectively, as determined on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels with carbohydrate-specific silver staining and blotting with anti-ganglioside ligands, and confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy. the c. jejuni nctc  <dig> original isolate  was compared to its genome-sequenced variant , and both were found to have a lower-mr los form, which was different in size and structure to the previously characterized higher-mr form bearing gm <dig> mimicry. the lower-mr form production was found to be dependent on the growth temperature as the production of this form increased from ~5%, observed at 37°c to ~35% at 42°c. the structure of the lower-mr form contained a β-d-gal--β-d-galnac disaccharide moiety which is consistent with the termini of the gm <dig>  asialo-gm <dig>  gd <dig>  gt <dig> and gq <dig> gangliosides, however, it did not display gm <dig> mimicry as assessed in blotting studies but was shown in nmr to resemble asialo-gm <dig>  the production of multiple los forms and lack of gm <dig> mimicry was not a result of phase variation in the genes tested of nctc  <dig> and was also observed in most of the human and chicken isolates of c. jejuni tested.


CONCLUSIONS
the presence of differing amounts of los forms at  <dig> and 42°c, and the variety of forms observed in different strains, indicate that los form variation may play a role in an adaptive mechanism or a stress response of the bacterium during the colonization of different hosts.
