BACKGROUND
fossil ticks are extremely rare and ixodes succineus weidner,  <dig> from eocene  baltic amber is one of the oldest examples of a living hard tick genus . previous work suggested it was most closely related to the modern and widespread european sheep tick ixodes ricinus .


RESULTS
restudy using phase contrast synchrotron x-ray tomography yielded images of exceptional quality. these confirm the fossil’s referral to ixodes latreille,  <dig>  but the characters resolved here suggest instead affinities with the asian subgenus partipalpiger hoogstraal et al.,  <dig> and its single living  species ixodes ovatus neumann,  <dig>  we redescribe the amber fossil here as ixodes  succineus.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that ixodes ricinus is unlikely to be directly derived from weidner’s amber species, but instead reveals that the partipalpiger lineage was originally more widely distributed across the northern hemisphere. the closeness of ixodes  succineus to a living vector of a wide range of pathogens offers the potential to correlate its spatial and temporal position  with the estimated origination dates of various tick-borne diseases.
