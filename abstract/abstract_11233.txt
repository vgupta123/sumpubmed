BACKGROUND
chronic systemic inflammation triggers alterations in the central nervous system that may relate to the underlying inflammatory component reported in neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple sclerosis and alzheimer's disease. however, it is far from being understood whether and how peripheral inflammation contributes to induce brain inflammatory response in such illnesses. as part of the barriers that separate the blood from the brain, the choroid plexus conveys inflammatory immune signals into the brain, largely through alterations in the composition of the cerebrospinal fluid.


RESULTS
in the present study we investigated the mouse choroid plexus gene expression profile, using microarray analyses, in response to a repeated inflammatory stimulus induced by the intraperitoneal administration of lipopolysaccharide every two weeks for a period of three months; mice were sacrificed  <dig> and  <dig> days after the last lipopolysaccharide injection. the data show that the choroid plexus displays a sustained response to the repeated inflammatory stimuli by altering the expression profile of several genes. from a total of  <dig>  probes,  <dig> are up-regulated and  <dig> are down-regulated  <dig> days after the last lipopolysaccharide injection, while at  <dig> days the number decreases to  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the pathways displaying the most significant changes include those facilitating entry of cells into the cerebrospinal fluid, and those participating in the innate immune response to infection.


CONCLUSIONS
these observations contribute to a better understanding of the brain response to peripheral inflammation and pave the way to study their impact on the progression of several disorders of the central nervous system in which inflammation is known to be implicated.
