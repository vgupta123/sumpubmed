BACKGROUND
pathogenic serotypes of vibrio cholerae cause the life-threatening diarrheal disease cholera. the increasing development of bacterial resistances against the known antibiotics necessitates the search for new antimicrobial compounds and targets for this pathogen.


RESULTS
a high-throughput screening assay with a vibrio cholerae reporter strain constitutively expressing green fluorescent protein  was developed and applied in the investigation of the growth inhibitory effect of approximately  <dig>  structurally diverse natural compounds and synthetic small molecules. several compounds with activities in the low micromolar concentration range were identified. the most active structure, designated vz <dig>  displayed a minimal inhibitory concentration  of  <dig>  μm and a minimal bactericidal concentration  of  <dig>  μm against several strains of v. cholerae and was specific for this pathogen. mutants with reduced sensitivity against vz <dig> were generated and whole genome sequencing of  <dig> pooled mutants was carried out. comparison with the genome of the wild type strain identified the gene vc_a <dig>  as the major site of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the resistant mutants. vc_a <dig> is located on the small chromosome of v. cholerae and encodes the osmosensitive k+-channel sensor histidine kinase . nucleotide exchange of the major mutation site in the wild type strain confirmed the sensitive phenotype.


CONCLUSIONS
the reporter strain mo <dig> pg <dig> was successfully used for the identification of new antibacterial compounds against v. cholerae. generation of resistant mutants and whole genome sequencing was carried out to identify the histidine kinase kdpd as a novel antimicrobial target.
