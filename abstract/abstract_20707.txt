BACKGROUND
the ets transcription factor elf <dig>  is highly expressed in the mammary gland and plays an important role in its development and differentiation. indeed studies in mice have illustrated an essential role for elf <dig> in directing alveologenesis during pregnancy. although the molecular mechanisms that underlie the developmental block in elf <dig> null mammary glands are beginning to be unraveled, this investigation has been hampered by limited information about the identity of elf5-target genes. to address this shortcoming, in this study we have performed chip-cloning experiments to identify the specific genomic segments that are occupied by elf <dig> in pregnant mouse mammary glands.


RESULTS
sequencing and genomic localization of cis-regulatory regions bound by elf <dig> in vivo has identified several potential target genes covering broad functional categories. a subset of these target genes demonstrates higher expression levels in elf5-null mammary glands suggesting a repressive functional role for this transcription factor. here we focus on one putative target of elf <dig>  the ccnd <dig> gene that appeared in our screen. we identify a novel elf5-binding segment upstream of the ccnd <dig> gene and demonstrate that elf <dig> can transcriptionally repress ccnd <dig> by directly binding to the proximal promoter region. finally, using elf5-null mammary epithelial cells and mammary glands, we show that loss of elf <dig> in vivo leads to up regulation of ccnd <dig> and an altered expression pattern in luminal cells.


CONCLUSIONS
identification of elf5-targets is an essential first step in elucidating the transcriptional landscape that is shaped by this important regulator. our studies offer new toolbox in examining the biological role of elf <dig> in mammary gland development and differentiation.
