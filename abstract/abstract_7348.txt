BACKGROUND
activator protein - <dig> and nuclear factor -κb largely control t-cell activation, following binding of foreign antigens to the t-cell receptor leading to cytokine secretion. elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as tnf, il- <dig> and cxcl <dig> are associated with several human diseases including cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis and aids. the aim of this study was to investigate the role of the transcription factors, ap- <dig> and nf-κb, in il- <dig> and cxcl <dig> regulation in jurkat t-cells.


RESULTS
phorbol myristate acetate  exposure resulted in an up-regulation of ap- <dig> and down-regulation of nf-κb activity, however, exposure to heat killed  escherichia. coli mg <dig> resulted in a dose-dependent increase in nf-κb activity without affecting ap- <dig>  the cytokine profile revealed an up-regulation of the chemokine cxcl <dig> and the pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf, il- <dig> and il- <dig> following treatment with both pma and hk e. coli, while the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> were not affected by pma but were significantly down-regulated by hk e. coli. ap- <dig> activation was significantly increased  <dig> h after pma exposure and continued to increase thereafter. in contrast, nf-κb responded to pma exposure by a rapid up-regulation followed by a subsequent down-regulation. increased intracellular ca2+ concentrations countered the down-regulation of nf-κb by pma, while similar treatment with calcium ionophore resulted in a reduced nf-κb activity following induction with hk e. coli. in order to further study nf-κb activation, we considered two up-stream signalling proteins, pkc and bcl <dig>  phosphorylated-pkc levels increased in response to pma and hk e. coli, while bcl <dig> levels significantly decreased following pma treatment. using an nf-κb activation inhibitor, we observed complete inhibition of il- <dig> expression while cxcl <dig> levels only decreased by 40% at the highest concentration. treatment of jurkat t-cells with pma in the presence of jnk-inhibitor suppressed both cxcl <dig> and il- <dig> while pkc-inhibitor primarily decreased cxcl <dig> expression.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study shows that nf-κb regulated il- <dig> but not cxcl <dig>  this complex regulation of cxcl <dig> suggests that there is a need to further evaluate the signalling pathways in order to develop new treatment for diseases with elevated cxcl <dig> levels, such as aids and autoimmune diseases.
