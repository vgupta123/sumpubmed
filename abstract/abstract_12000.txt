BACKGROUND
among the different tobacco products that are available on the us market, cigarette smoking is shown to be the most harmful and the effects of cigarette smoking have been well studied. us epidemiological studies indicate that non-combustible tobacco products are less harmful than smoking and yet very limited biological and mechanistic information is available on the effects of these alternative tobacco products. for the first time, we characterized gene expression profiling in pbmcs from moist snuff consumers , compared with that from consumers of cigarettes  and non-tobacco consumers .


RESULTS
microarray analysis identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes  between the smk and ntc groups and  <dig> degs between smk and msc groups. however, we found no significant differences in gene expression between msc and ntc. both hierarchical clustering and principle component analysis revealed that msc and ntc expression profiles were more similar than to smk. random forest classification identified a subset of degs which predicted smk from either ntc or msc with high accuracy .


CONCLUSIONS
pmbc gene expression profiles of ntc and msc are similar to each other, while smk exhibit distinct profiles with alterations in immune related pathways. in addition to discovering several biomarkers, these studies support further understanding of the biological effects of different tobacco products.
