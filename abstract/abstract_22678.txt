BACKGROUND
endocrine disrupting chemicals  are known to affect reproduction in fish. 17α-ethynylestradiol is a synthetic estrogen used in birth control pills. 17β-trenbolone is a relatively stable metabolite of trenbolone acetate, a synthetic androgen used as a growth promoter in livestock. both 17α-ethynylestradiol and 17β-trenbolone have been found in the aquatic environment and affect fish reproduction. in this study, we developed a physiologically-based computational model for female fathead minnows , a small fish species used in ecotoxicology, to simulate how estrogens  or androgens  affect reproductive endpoints such as plasma concentrations of steroid hormones  and vitellogenin .


RESULTS
using markov chain monte carlo simulations, the model was calibrated with data from unexposed, 17α-ethynylestradiol-exposed, and 17β-trenbolone-exposed fhms. four markov chains were simulated, and the chains for each calibrated model parameter  converged within  <dig>  iterations. with the converged parameter values, we evaluated the model's predictive ability by simulating a variety of independent experimental data. the model predictions agreed with the experimental data well.


CONCLUSIONS
the physiologically-based computational model represents the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in adult female fhm robustly. the model is useful to estimate how estrogens  or androgens  affect plasma concentrations of 17β-estradiol, testosterone and vitellogenin, which are important determinants of fecundity in fish.
