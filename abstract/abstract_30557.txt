BACKGROUND
redistribution of nuclear tar dna binding protein  <dig>  to the cytoplasm and ubiquitinated inclusions of spinal motor neurons and glial cells is characteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  pathology. recent evidence suggests that tdp- <dig> pathology is common to sporadic als and familial als without sod <dig> mutation, but not sod1-related fals cases. furthermore, it remains unclear whether tdp- <dig> abnormalities occur in non-als forms of motor neuron disease. here, we characterise tdp- <dig> localisation, expression levels and post-translational modifications in mouse models of als and spinal muscular atrophy .


RESULTS
tdp- <dig> mislocalisation to ubiquitinated inclusions or cytoplasm was notably lacking in anterior horn cells from transgenic mutant sod1g93a mice. in addition, abnormally phosphorylated or truncated tdp- <dig> species were not detected in fractionated als mouse spinal cord or brain. despite partial colocalisation of tdp- <dig> with smn, depletion of smn- and coilin-positive cajal bodies in motor neurons of affected sma mice did not alter nuclear tdp- <dig> distribution, expression or biochemistry in spinal cords.


CONCLUSIONS
these results emphasise that tdp- <dig> pathology characteristic of human sporadic als is not a core component of the neurodegenerative mechanisms caused by sod <dig> mutation or smn deficiency in mouse models of als and sma, respectively.
