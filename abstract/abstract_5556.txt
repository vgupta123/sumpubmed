BACKGROUND
three phenotypic identification systems  were evaluated for their accuracy to identify coagulase-negative staphylococci . a total of  <dig> clinical isolates confirmed to be cns via 16s rrna sequencing and analysis with the microseq  <dig> v <dig>  database were assessed.


RESULTS
the microscan, vitek  <dig>  and crystal gp systems correctly identified  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the isolates, respectively. misidentification was the main problem in microscan  and crystal gp  systems, whereas the main problem of vitek  <dig> was low-level discrimination .


CONCLUSIONS
none of the  <dig> phenotypic systems tested could accurately and reliably identify cns at the species level. further verifications such as biochemical testing or 16s rrna sequencing together with analysis using a comparable database might be helpful in this regard.
