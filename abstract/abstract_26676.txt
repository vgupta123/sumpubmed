BACKGROUND
non-coding small rnas, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides in length, mediate the regulation of gene expression and play important roles in many biological processes. one class of small rnas, micrornas , are highly conserved across taxa and mediate the regulation of the chromatin state and the post-transcriptional regulation of messenger rna . another class of small rnas is the piwi-interacting rnas, which play important roles in the silencing of transposons and other functional genes. although the biological functions of the different small rnas have been elucidated in several laboratory animals, little is known regarding naturally occurring variation in small rna transcriptomes among closely related species.


RESULTS
we employed next-generation sequencing technology to compare the expression profiles of brain small rnas between sympatric species of the japanese threespine stickleback . we identified several small rnas that were differentially expressed between sympatric pacific ocean and japan sea sticklebacks. potential targets of several small rnas were identified as repetitive sequences. female-biased mirna expression from the old x chromosome was also observed, and it was attributed to the degeneration of the y chromosome.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that expression patterns of small rna can differ between incipient species and may be a potential mechanism underlying differential mrna expression and transposon activity.
