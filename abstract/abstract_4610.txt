BACKGROUND
noncoding rnas  play important roles in a variety of cellular processes. characterizing the transcriptional activity of ncrna promoters is therefore a critical step toward understanding the complex cellular roles of ncrnas.


RESULTS
here we present an in vivo transcriptional analysis of three c. elegans ncrna upstream motifs . transcriptional activity of all three motifs has been demonstrated, and mutational analysis revealed differential contributions of different parts of each motif. we showed that upstream motif  <dig>  can drive the expression of green fluorescent protein , and utilized this for detailed analysis of temporal and spatial expression patterns of  <dig> sl <dig> rnas. upstream motifs  <dig> and  <dig> do not drive gfp expression, and termination at consecutive t runs suggests transcription by rna polymerase iii. the um <dig> sequence resembles the trna promoter, and is actually embedded within its own short-lived, primary transcript. this is a structure which is also found at a few plant and yeast loci, and may indicate an evolutionarily very old dicistronic transcription pattern in which a trna serves as a promoter for an adjacent snorna.


CONCLUSIONS
the study has demonstrated that the three upstream motifs um1- <dig> have promoter activity. the um <dig> sequence can drive expression of gfp, which allows for the use of um1::gfp fusion constructs to study temporal-spatial expression patterns of um <dig> ncrna loci. the um <dig> loci appear to act in concert with other upstream sequences, whereas the transcriptional activities of the um <dig> and um <dig> are confined to the motifs themselves.
