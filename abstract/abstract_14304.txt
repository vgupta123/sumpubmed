BACKGROUND
polycomb repressive complex  <dig>  is an essential protein complex for plant development. it catalyzes ubiquitination of histone h2a that is an important part of the transcription repression machinery. absence of prc <dig> subunits in arabidopsis thaliana plants causes severe developmental defects. many aspects of the plant prc <dig> are elusive, including its origin and phylogenetic distribution.


RESULTS
we established the evolutionary history of the plant prc <dig> subunits , enabled by sensitive phylogenetic methods and newly sequenced plant genomes from previously unsampled taxonomic groups.

we showed that all prc <dig> core subunits exist in gymnosperms, earlier than previously thought, and that vrn <dig> is a recent addition, found exclusively in eudicots. the retention of individual subunits in chlorophytes, mosses, lycophytes and monilophytes indicates that they can moonlight as part of other complexes or processes. moreover, we showed that most prc <dig> subunits underwent a complex, duplication-rich history that differs significantly between brassicaceae and other eudicots.


CONCLUSIONS
prc <dig> existed in the last common ancestor of seed plants where it likely played an important regulatory role, aiding their radiation. the presence of lhp <dig>  ring <dig> and bmi <dig> in mosses, lycophytes and monilophytes also suggests the presence of a primitive yet functional prc <dig>
