BACKGROUND
the eight-twenty-one  nuclear co-repressor gene belongs to the eto homologue family also containing myeloid translocation gene on chromosome  <dig>  and myeloid translocation gene-related protein  <dig> . by chromosomal translocations eto and mtg <dig> become parts of fusion proteins characteristic of morphological variants of acute myeloid leukemia. normal functions of eto homologues have as yet not been examined. the goal of this work was to identify structural and functional promoter elements upstream of the coding sequence of the eto gene in order to explore lineage-specific hematopoietic expression and get hints to function.


RESULTS
a putative proximal eto promoter was identified within  <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start site. strong eto promoter activity was specifically observed upon transfection of a promoter reporter construct into erythroid/megakaryocytic cells, which have endogeneous eto gene activity. an evolutionary conserved region of  <dig> bp revealed potential cis-elements involved in transcription of eto. disruption of the evolutionary conserved gata - <dig> consensus binding site repressed transactivation and disruption of the ets <dig> - <dig> consensus binding site enhanced activity of the eto promoter. the promoter was stimulated by overexpression of gata- <dig> into erythroid/megakaryocytic cells. electrophoretic mobility shift assay with erythroid/megakaryocytic cells showed specific binding of gata- <dig> to the gata - <dig> site. furthermore, results from chromatin immunoprecipitation showed gata- <dig> binding in vivo to the conserved region of the eto promoter containing the - <dig> site. the results suggest that the gata - <dig> site may have a role in activation of the eto gene activity in cells with erythroid/megakaryocytic potential. leukemia associated aml1-eto strongly suppressed an eto promoter reporter in erythroid/megakaryocytic cells.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that the gata- <dig> transcription factor binds and transactivates the eto proximal promoter in an erythroid/megakaryocytic-specific manner. thus, trans-acting factors that are essential in erythroid/megakaryocytic differentiation govern eto expression.
