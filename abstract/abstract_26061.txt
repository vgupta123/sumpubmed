BACKGROUND
lentiviral vectors  can efficiently transduce a broad spectrum of cells and tissues, including dividing and non-dividing cells. so far the most widely used method for concentration of lentiviral particles is ultracentrifugation .

an important feature of vectors derived from lentiviruses and prototypic gamma-retroviruses is that the host range can be altered by pseudotypisation. the most commonly used envelope protein for pseudotyping is the glycoprotein of the vesicular stomatitis virus , which is also essential for successful concentration using uc.


RESULTS
here, we describe a purification method that is based on membrane adsorbers . viral particles are efficiently retained by the anionic exchange mas and can be eluted with a high-salt buffer. buffer exchange and concentration is then performed by utilizing ultrafiltration  units of distinct molecular weight cut off . with this combined approach similar biological titers as uc can be achieved /ml). lentiviral particles from small starting volumes  as well as large volumes  cell culture supernatant  can be purified. apart from lvs, vectors derived from oncoretroviruses can be efficiently concentrated as well. importantly, the use of the system is not confined to vsv.g pseudotyped lenti- and retroviral particles and other pseudotypes can also be purified.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together the method presented here offers an efficient alternative for the concentration of lenti- as well as retroviral vectors with different pseudotypes that needs no expensive equipment, is easy to handle and can be used to purify large quantities of viral vectors within a short time.
