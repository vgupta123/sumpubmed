BACKGROUND
a substantial amount of data has been accumulated supporting the important role of genomic islands  - including pathogenicity islands  - in bacterial genome plasticity and the evolution of bacterial pathogens. their instability and the high level sequence similarity of different  islands suggest an exchange of pais between strains of the same or even different bacterial species by horizontal gene transfer . transfer events of archetypal large genomic islands of enterobacteria which often lack genes required for mobilisation or transfer have been rarely investigated so far.


RESULTS
to study mobilisation of such large genomic regions in prototypic uropathogenic e. coli  strain  <dig>  pai ii <dig> was supplemented with the mobrp <dig> region, an origin of replication , an origin of transfer  and a chloramphenicol resistance selection marker. in the presence of helper plasmid rp <dig>  conjugative transfer of the 107-kb pai ii <dig> construct occured from strain  <dig> into an e. coli k- <dig> recipient. in transconjugants, pai ii <dig> existed either as a cytoplasmic circular intermediate  or integrated site-specifically into the recipient's chromosome at the leux trna gene. this locus is the chromosomal integration site of pai ii <dig> in upec strain  <dig>  from the e. coli k- <dig> recipient, the chromosomal pai ii <dig> construct as well as the cis could be successfully remobilised and inserted into leux in a pai ii <dig> deletion mutant of e. coli  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results corroborate that mobilisation and conjugal transfer may contribute to evolution of bacterial pathogens through horizontal transfer of large chromosomal regions such as pais. stabilisation of these mobile genetic elements in the bacterial chromosome result from selective loss of mobilisation and transfer functions of genomic islands.
