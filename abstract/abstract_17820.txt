BACKGROUND
atherosclerosis is now recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease. angiotensin ii  is a critical factor in inflammatory responses, which promotes the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. placental growth factor  is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor  family cytokines and is associated with inflammatory progress of atherosclerosis. however, the potential link between plgf and ang ii has not been investigated. in the current study, whether ang ii could regulate plgf expression, and the effect of plgf on cell proliferation, was investigated in human vascular endothelial cells  and smooth muscle cells .


RESULTS
in growth-arrested human vecs and vsmcs, ang ii induced plgf mrna expression after  <dig> hour treatment, and peaked at  <dig> hours. 10- <dig> mol/l ang ii increased plgf protein production after  <dig> hour treatment, and peaked at  <dig> hours. stimulation with ang ii also induced mrna expression of vegf receptor- <dig> and - <dig> in these cells. the ang ii type i receptor  antagonist blocked ang ii-induced plgf gene expression and protein production. several intracellular signals elicited by ang ii were involved in plgf synthesis, including activation of protein kinase c, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/ <dig>  and pi3-kinase. a neutralizing antibody against plgf partially inhibited the ang ii-induced proliferation of vecs and vsmcs. however, this antibody showed little effect on the basal proliferation in these cells, whereas blocking antibody of vegf could suppress both basal and ang ii-induced proliferation in vecs and vsmcs.


CONCLUSIONS
our results showed for the first time that ang ii could induce the gene expression and protein production of plgf in vecs and vsmcs, which might play an important role in the pathogenesis of vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis.
