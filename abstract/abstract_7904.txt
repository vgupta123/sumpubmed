BACKGROUND
metabolic pathway diagrams are a classical way of visualizing a linked cascade of biochemical reactions. however, to understand some biochemical situations, viewing a single pathway is insufficient, whereas viewing the entire metabolic network results in information overload. how do we enable scientists to rapidly construct personalized multi-pathway diagrams that depict a desired collection of interacting pathways that emphasize particular pathway interactions?


RESULTS
we define software for constructing personalized multi-pathway diagrams called pathway-collages using a combination of manual and automatic layouts. the user specifies a set of pathways of interest for the collage from a pathway/genome database. layouts for the individual pathways are generated by the pathway tools software, and are sent to a javascript pathway collage application implemented using cytoscape.js. that application allows the user to re-position pathways; define connections between pathways; change visual style parameters; and paint metabolomics, gene expression, and reaction flux data onto the collage to obtain a desired multi-pathway diagram. we demonstrate the use of pathway collages in two application areas: a metabolomics study of pathogen drug response, and an escherichia coli metabolic model.


CONCLUSIONS
pathway collages enable facile construction of personalized multi-pathway diagrams.
