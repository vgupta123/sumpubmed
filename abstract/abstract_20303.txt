BACKGROUND
as an obligatory intracellular parasite, trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of chagas' disease, must invade and multiply within mammalian cells. cytokeratin  <dig>  is among the host molecules that have been suggested as a mediator of important events during t. cruzi-host cell interaction. based on that possibility, we addressed whether rna interference -mediated down regulation of the ck <dig> gene could interfere with the parasite life cycle in vitro. hela cells transiently transfected with ck18-rnai had negligible levels of ck <dig> transcripts, and significantly reduced levels of ck <dig> protein expression as determined by immunoblotting or immunofluorescence.


RESULTS
ck <dig> negative or positive hela cells were invaded equally as well by trypomastigotes of different t. cruzi strains. also, in ck <dig> negative or positive cells, parasites recruited host cells lysosomes and escaped from the parasitophorous vacuole equally as well. after that, the growth of amastigotes of the y or cl-brener strains, was drastically arrested in ck <dig> rnai-treated cells. after  <dig> hours, the number of amastigotes was several times lower in ck <dig> rnai-treated cells when compared to control cells. simultaneous staining of parasites and ck <dig> showed that in hela cells infected with the y strain both co-localize. although the amastigote surface protein- <dig> contains the domain vtvxnvflynr previously described to bind to ck <dig>  in several attempts, we failed to detect binding of a recombinant protein to ck- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the study demonstrates that silencing ck <dig> by transient rnai, inhibits intracellular multiplication of the y and cl strain of t. cruzi in hela cells, but not trypanosome binding and invasion.
