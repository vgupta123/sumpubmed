BACKGROUND
for heterozygous genes, alleles on the chromatin from two different parents exhibit histone modification variations known as allele-specific histone modifications . the regulation of allele-specific gene expression  by ashms has been reported in animals. however, to date, the regulation of ase by ashm genes remains poorly understood in higher plants.


RESULTS
we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing  to investigate the global ashm profiles of trimethylation on histone h <dig> lysine  <dig>  and histone h <dig> lysine  <dig>  in two rice f <dig> hybrids. a total of  <dig> to  <dig> allele-specific h3k27me <dig> genes and  <dig> to  <dig> allele-specific h3k36me <dig> genes were detected in gl × 93- <dig> and gl × tq, accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total analyzed genes, respectively. the epialleles between parents were highly related to ashms. further analysis indicated that  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the epialleles were faithfully inherited by the f <dig> hybrid and contributed to  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the ashm genes. importantly,  <dig> % to  <dig> % of monoallelic expression genes contained the h3k36me <dig> modification. further studies demonstrated a significant positive correlation of ase with allele-specific h3k36me <dig> but not with h3k27me <dig>  indicating that ashm-h3k36me <dig> primarily regulates ase in this study.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that epialleles from parents can be inherited by the f <dig> to produce ashms in the f <dig> hybrid. our findings indicate that ashm-h3k36me <dig>  rather than h3k27me <dig>  mainly regulates ase in hybrid rice.
