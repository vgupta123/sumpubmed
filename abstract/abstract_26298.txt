BACKGROUND
the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts, rage, is involved in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory conditions, which is mostly related to its strong activation of nf-κb but also due to its function as ligand for the β2-integrin mac- <dig>  to further dissect the stimulus-dependent role of rage on leukocyte recruitment during inflammation, we investigated β2-integrin-dependent leukocyte adhesion in rage-/- and icam1-/- mice in different cremaster muscle models of inflammation using intravital microscopy.


RESULTS
we demonstrate that rage, but not icam- <dig> substantially contributes to n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine -induced leukocyte adhesion in tnf-α-pretreated cremaster muscle venules in a mac-1-dependent manner. in contrast, fmlp-stimulated leukocyte adhesion in unstimulated cremaster muscle venules is independent of rage, but dependent on icam- <dig> and its interaction with lfa- <dig>  furthermore, chemokine cxcl1-stimulated leukocyte adhesion in surgically prepared cremaster muscle venules was independent of rage but strongly dependent on icam- <dig> and lfa- <dig> suggesting a differential and stimulus-dependent regulation of leukocyte adhesion during inflammation in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that rage and icam- <dig> differentially regulate leukocyte adhesion in vivo in a stimulus-dependent manner.
