BACKGROUND
bacteria employ multiple mechanisms to control gene expression and react to their constantly changing environment. bacterial growth in rich laboratory medium is a dynamic process in which bacteria utilize nutrients from simple to complex and change physical properties of the medium, as ph, during the process. to determine which genes are differentially expressed throughout growth from mid log to stationary phase, we performed global transcript analysis.


RESULTS
the s. agalactiae transcriptome is dynamic in response to growth conditions. several genes and regulons involved in virulence factor production and utilization of alternate carbon sources were differentially expressed throughout growth.


CONCLUSIONS
these data provide new information about the magnitude of plasticity of the s. agalactiae transcriptome and its adaptive response to changing environmental conditions. the resulting information will greatly assist investigators studying s. agalactiae physiology and pathogenesis.
