BACKGROUND
extracellular nucleotides  exert a wide range of biological effects in blood cells mediated by multiple ionotropic p2x receptors and g protein-coupled p2y receptors. although pharmacological experiments have suggested the presence of several p <dig> receptor subtypes on monocytes and lymphocytes, some results are contradictory. few physiological functions have been firmly established to a specific receptor subtype, partly because of a lack of truly selective agonists and antagonists. this stimulated us to investigate the expression of p2x and p2y receptors in human lymphocytes and monocytes with a newly established quantitative mrna assay for p <dig> receptors. in addition, we describe for the first time the expression of p <dig> receptors in cd34+ stem and progenitor cells implicating a potential role of p <dig> receptors in hematopoietic lineage and progenitor/stem cell function.


RESULTS
using a quantitative mrna assay, we assessed the hypothesis that there are specific p <dig> receptor profiles in inflammatory cells. the p2x <dig> receptor had the highest expression in lymphocytes and monocytes. among the p2y receptors, p2y <dig> and p2y <dig> had highest expression in lymphocytes, while the p2y <dig> and p2y <dig> had highest expression in monocytes. several p <dig> receptors were expressed  in cd34+ stem and progenitor cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the most interesting findings were the high mrna expression of p2y <dig> receptors in lymphocytes potentially explaining the anti-inflammatory effects of clopidogrel, p2y <dig> receptors in monocytes and a previously unrecognised expression of p2x <dig> in lymphocytes and monocytes. in addition, for the first time p <dig> receptor mrna expression patterns was studied in cd34+ stem and progenitor cells. several p <dig> receptors were expressed , indicating a role in differentiation and proliferation. thus, it is possible that specific antibodies to p <dig> receptors could be used to identify progenitors for monocytes, lymphocytes and megakaryocytes.
