BACKGROUND
the precise nature of how cell type specific chromatin structures at enhancer sites affect gene expression is largely unknown. here we identified cell type specific enhancers coupled with gene expression in two different types of breast epithelial cells, hmec  and mdamb <dig> .


RESULTS
enhancers were defined by modified neighboring histones  and nucleosome depletion . histone modifications at enhancers were related to the expression levels of nearby genes up to 750 kb away. these expression levels were correlated with enhancer status , defined by surrounding histone marks. furthermore, about fifty percent of poised and active enhancers contained nucleosome-depleted regions. we also identified response element motifs enriched at these enhancer sites that revealed key transcription factors  likely involved in regulating breast epithelial enhancer-mediated gene expression. by utilizing expression data, potential target genes of more than  <dig> active enhancers were identified. these genes were involved in proteolysis, epidermis development, cell adhesion, mitosis, cell cycle, and dna replication.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings facilitate the understanding of epigenetic regulation specifically, such as the relationships between regulatory elements and gene expression and generally, how breast epithelial cellular phenotypes are determined by cell type specific enhancers.
