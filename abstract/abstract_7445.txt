BACKGROUND
the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases  of gibberellin  biosynthesis have a key role in the metabolism of a major plant hormone. the activity of recombinant ga 2odds from many species has been characterised in detail, however little information relates to enzyme purification. native ga 2odds displayed lability during purification.


RESULTS
two ga 2odds were expressed in escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. the ga 2-oxidase from pisum sativum l., psga2ox <dig>  was expressed as a glutathione s-transferase  fusion. it was purified in the three steps of affinity chromatography, gst removal and gel filtration. highly pure psga2ox <dig> was obtained at a yield of  <dig>  mg/g of cells. it displayed a km of  <dig>  μm and a vmax of  <dig>  pkat/mg toward ga <dig>  the ga 3-oxidase from arabidopsis thaliana, atga3ox <dig>  was expressed as a poly-tagged thioredoxin fusion. it was purified by immobilised metal affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration. cleavage of the fusion took place between the two purification steps. highly pure atga3ox <dig> was obtained at a yield of  <dig>  mg/g of cells. it displayed a km of  <dig>  μm and vmax of  <dig>  pkat/mg toward ga <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
fusion tags were required to stabilise and solubilise psga2ox <dig> and atga3ox <dig> during e. coli expression. the successful purification of milligram quantities of psga2ox <dig> enables mechanistic and structural studies not previously possible on ga 2odds. a moderate yield of pure atga3ox <dig> requires the further optimisation of the latter stages of the enzyme purification schedule. psga2ox1's action in planta as deduced from the effect of the null mutation sln on ga levels in seeds is in agreement with the kinetic parameters of the recombinant enzyme.
