BACKGROUND
rats lever-press for access to running wheels suggesting that wheel running by itself is reinforcing. furthermore, pairings of an episode of wheel running and subsequent confinement in a specific environment can establish a conditioned place preference . this finding implies that the reinforcing effects of wheel running outlast the actual occurrence of physical activity, a phenomenon referred to as aftereffect of wheel running. aftereffect-induced cpp involves pavlovian conditioning, i.e. repeated pairings of the aftereffect of wheel running with a specific environment creates a learned association between aftereffect and environment and, in turn, a preference for that environment. given the involvement of dopamine systems in mediating effects of pavlovian stimuli on appetitive behavior, a role of dopamine in mediating aftereffect-induced cpp seems plausible. here we assessed whether the mixed d1/d <dig> receptor antagonist flupenthixol  can block the expression of an aftereffect-induced cpp.


RESULTS
in line with earlier studies, our results demonstrate that rats displayed a conditioned preference for environments paired with the aftereffect of wheel running and further show that the magnitude of cpp was not related to the wheel running rate. furthermore, we found that flupenthixol  reduced locomotor activity but did not attenuate the expression of an aftereffect-induced cpp.


CONCLUSIONS
the expression of a cpp produced by the aftereffect of wheel running seems not to depend on dopamine d1/d <dig> receptor activation.
