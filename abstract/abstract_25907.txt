BACKGROUND
paralog reduction, the loss of duplicate genes after whole genome duplication  is a pervasive process. whether this loss proceeds gene by gene or through deletion of multi-gene dna segments is controversial, as is the question of fractionation bias, namely whether one homeologous chromosome is more vulnerable to gene deletion than the other.


RESULTS
as a null hypothesis, we first assume deletion events, on either homeolog, excise a geometrically distributed number of genes with unknown mean μ, and a number r of these events overlap to produce deleted runs of length l. there is a fractionation bias  <dig> ≤ ϕ ≤  <dig> for deletions to fall on one homeolog rather than the other. the parameter r is a random variable with distribution π. we simulate the distribution of run lengths l, as well as the underlying π, as a function of μ, ϕ and θ, the proportion of remaining genes in duplicate form. we show how sampling l allows us to estimate μ and ϕ. the main part of this work is the derivation of a deterministic recurrence to calculate each π as a function of μ, ϕ and θ.


CONCLUSIONS
the recurrence for π provides a deeper mathematical understanding of fractionation process than simulations. the parameters μ and ϕ can be estimated based on run lengths of single-copy regions.
