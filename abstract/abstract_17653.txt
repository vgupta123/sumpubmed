BACKGROUND
serine/threonine kinase  <dig>  has been shown to be conserved across all major vertebrate classes including reptiles, mammals, amphibians and fish, suggesting its importance within vertebrates. it has been shown to phosphorylate vimentin and might play a role in spermatogenesis and organ ontogenesis. in this study we analyzed the genomic locus and expression of stk <dig> in the class aves, using a combination of large scale next generation sequencing data analysis and traditional pcr.


RESULTS
within the subclass palaeognathae we analyzed the white-throated tinamou , the african ostrich  and the emu . for the african ostrich we were able to generate a  <dig>  bp long genomic contig and an mrna sequence that encodes a protein showing highly significant similarity to stk <dig> proteins from other vertebrates. the emu has been shown to encode and transcribe a functional stk <dig> as well. for the white-throated tinamou we were able to identify  <dig> exons by sequence comparison encoding a protein similar to stk <dig> as well.

in contrast, in all  <dig> neognath birds analyzed, we could not find evidence for the existence of a functional copy of stk <dig> or its expression. in the genomes of these  <dig> bird species, we found only remnants of the stk <dig> locus carrying several large genomic deletions, leading to the loss of multiple exons. the remaining exons have acquired various indels and premature stop codons.


CONCLUSIONS
we were able to elucidate and describe the genomic structure and the transcription of a functional stk <dig> gene within the subclass palaeognathae, but we could only find degenerate remnants of stk <dig> in all neognath birds analyzed. this led us to the conclusion that stk <dig> became a unitary pseudogene in the evolutionary history of the class aves at the paleognath-neognath branch point during the late cretaceous period about  <dig> million years ago. we hypothesize that the pseudogenization of stk <dig> might have become fixed in neognaths due to either genetic redundancy or a non-orthologous gene displacement and present potential candidate genes for such an incident.
