BACKGROUND
upstream open reading frames  are elements found in the 5'-region of an mrna transcript, capable of regulating protein production of the largest, or major orf , and impacting organismal development and growth in fungi, plants, and animals. in drosophila, approximately 40% of transcripts contain upstream start codons  but there is little evidence that these are translated and affect their associated morf.


RESULTS
analyzing  <dig>  drosophila melanogaster transcript annotations and  <dig>  dipteran est sequences we have identified  <dig> putative conserved peptide uorfs  in drosophila melanogaster that show evidence of negative selection, and therefore are likely to be translated. transcripts with cpuorfs constitute approximately  <dig> % of the total number of transcripts, a similar frequency to the arabidopsis genome, and have a mean length of  <dig> amino acids, much larger than the mean length of plant cpuorfs . there is a statistically significant clustering of cpuorfs at cytological band  <dig> , a phenomenon that has never been described for uorfs. based on go term and interpro domain analyses, genes in the uorf dataset show a higher frequency of orfs implicated in mitochondrial import than the genome-wide frequency  as well as methyltransferases .


CONCLUSIONS
based on these data, it is clear that drosophila contain putative cpuorfs at frequencies similar to those found in plants. they are distinguished, however, by the type of morf they tend to associate with, drosophila cpuorfs preferentially occurring in transcripts encoding mitochondrial proteins and methyltransferases. this provides a basis for the study of cpuorfs and their putative regulatory role in mitochondrial function and disease.
