BACKGROUND
previously, the hypothetical protein, kpn <dig> from klebsiella pneumoniae mgh <dig> was the succinate dehydrogenase  chain c subunit via structural prediction and molecular docking simulation studies. however, due to limitation in docking simulation, an in-depth understanding of how sdh interaction occurs across the transmembrane of mitochondria could not be provided.


RESULTS
in this present study, molecular dynamics  simulation of kpn <dig> and sdh chain d in a membrane was performed in order to gain a deeper insight into its molecular role as sdh. structural stability was successfully obtained in the calculation for area per lipid, tail order parameter, thickness of lipid and secondary structural properties. interestingly, water molecules were found to be highly possible in mediating the interaction between ubiquinone  and sdh chain c via interaction with ser <dig> and arg <dig> residues as compared with earlier docking study. polar residues such as asp <dig> and glu <dig> , asp <dig> and glu <dig>  might have contributed in the creation of a polar environment which is essential for electron transport chain in krebs cycle.


CONCLUSIONS
as a conclusion, a part from the structural stability comparability, the dynamic of the interacting residues and hydrogen bonding analysis had further proved that the interaction of kpn <dig> as sdh is preserved and well agreed with our postulation earlier.
