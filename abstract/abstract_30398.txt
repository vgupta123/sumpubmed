BACKGROUND
arsenic  is a natural metalloid, widely used in anthropogenic activities, that can exist in different oxidation states. throughout the world, there are several environments contaminated with high amounts of arsenic where many organisms can survive. the most stable arsenical species are arsenate and arsenite that can be subject to chemically and microbiologically oxidation, reduction and methylation reactions. organisms surviving in arsenic contaminated environments can have a diversity of mechanisms to resist to the harmful effects of arsenical compounds.


RESULTS
the highly metal resistant ochrobactrum tritici scii <dig> was able to grow in media with arsenite , arsenate  and antimonite . this strain contains two arsenic and antimony resistance operons , which were cloned and sequenced. sequence analysis indicated that ars <dig> operon contains five genes encoding the following proteins: arsr, arsd, arsa, cbs-domain-containing protein and arsb. the ars <dig> operon is composed of six genes that encode two other arsr, two arsc , one acr <dig> and one arsh-like protein. the involvement of ars operons in arsenic resistance was confirmed by cloning both of them in an escherichia coli ars-mutant. the ars <dig> operon conferred resistance to arsenite and antimonite on e. coli cells, whereas the ars <dig> operon was also responsible for resistance to arsenite and arsenate. although arsh was not required for arsenate resistance, this gene seems to be important to confer high levels of arsenite resistance. none of ars <dig> genes were detected in the other type strains of genus ochrobactrum, but sequences homologous with ars <dig> operon were identified in some strains.


CONCLUSIONS
a new strategy for bacterial arsenic resistance is described in this work. two operons involved in arsenic resistance, one giving resistance to arsenite and antimonite and the other giving resistance to arsenate were found in the same bacterial strain.
