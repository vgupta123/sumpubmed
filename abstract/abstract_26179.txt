BACKGROUND
the slc11a1/nramp <dig> and slc11a2/nramp <dig> genes belong to the slc11/nramp family of transmembrane divalent metal transporters, with slc11a <dig> being associated with resistance to pathogens and slc11a <dig> involved in intestinal iron uptake and transferrin-bound iron transport. both members of the slc <dig> gene family have been clearly identified in tetrapods; however slc11a <dig> has never been documented in teleost fish and is believed to have been lost in this lineage during early vertebrate evolution. in the present work we characterized the slc <dig> genes in teleosts and evaluated if the roles attributed to mammalian slc <dig> genes are assured by other fish specific slc <dig> gene members.


RESULTS
two different slc <dig> genes were isolated in the european sea bass , and named slc11a2-α and slc11a2-β, since both were found to be evolutionary closer to tetrapods slc11a <dig>  through phylogenetic analysis and comparative genomics. induction of slc11a2-α and slc11a2-β in sea bass, upon iron modulation or exposure to photobacterium damselae spp. piscicida, was evaluated in in vivo or in vitro experimental models. overall, slc11a2-α was found to respond only to iron deficiency in the intestine, whereas slc11a2-β was found to respond to iron overload and bacterial infection in several tissues and also in the leukocytes.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggests that despite the absence of slc11a <dig>  its functions have been undertaken by one of the slc11a <dig> duplicated paralogs in teleost fish in a case of synfunctionalization, being involved in both iron metabolism and response to bacterial infection. this study provides, to our knowledge, the first example of this type of sub-functionalization in iron metabolism genes, illustrating how conserving the various functions of the slc <dig> gene family is of crucial evolutionary importance.
