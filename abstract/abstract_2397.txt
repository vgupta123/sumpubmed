BACKGROUND
we have developed an oligonucleotide microarray  utilizing a double tandem hybridization technique to search for  <dig> point mutations located in the most frequently altered codons of the tp <dig> gene. isolated and multiplexed pcr products,  <dig> and  <dig> bp long, from exons  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were obtained from  <dig> different samples. single-stranded target dna was then prepared from isolated or multiplexed pcr products, through cyclic dna synthesis. independent ssdna's were annealed with the corresponding pairs of labeled stacking oligonucleotides to create partially duplex dna having a 7-nt gap, which contains the sequence that will be interrogated by the capture probes forming double tandem hybridization. in the case of multiplexed sspcr products, only two stacking oligonucleotides were added per target, therefore the gap for the pcr products having two consecutive codons to be interrogated in exon  <dig> was  <dig> nt long, so only single tandem hybridization was produced with these respective probes.


RESULTS
 <dig> codon substitutions were found by dna sequencing. in  <dig> of them a perfect correlation with the pattern of hybridization was seen . in  <dig> other cases a mutation was falsely suggested by the combination of the absence of the wild type signal along with a false signal in the other probe. in the other  <dig> cases the presence of the mutation was not detected due to the production of a false hybridization signal with the wild type probe. in both cases  relatively stable mismatched target/probe duplexes should be formed. these problems could be avoided by the addition of probes to improve the performance of the array.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that a simple tp <dig> microarray employing short  probes, used in combination with single or double tandem hybridization approach and a simple or multiplex target preparation method, can identify common tp <dig> missense mutations from a variety of dna sources with good specificity.
