BACKGROUND
the abca <dig> protein plays a pivotal role in reverse cholesterol transport, by mediating the generation of hdl particles and removing cellular cholesterol. both the proper expression of abca <dig> in the plasma membrane and the internalization along with apoa-i are required for function. therefore, we developed a model system to investigate the effect of clinically relevant drugs on the cell surface appearance of abca <dig> 


RESULTS
by retroviral transduction system, we established stable mammalian cell lines expressing functional and non-functional abca <dig> variants, tagged with an extracellular hemagglutinin epitope. after characterization of the expression, proper localization and function of different abca <dig> variants, we followed quantitatively their cell surface expression by immunofluorescent staining, using flow cytometry. as expected, we found increased cell surface expression of abca <dig> after treatment with a calpain inhibitor, and observed a strong decrease in plasma membrane abca <dig> expression upon treatment with a trans-golgi transport inhibitor, brefeldin a. we tested cholesterol level lowering drugs and other potential inhibitors of abca <dig>  here we demonstrate that ezetimibe affects abca <dig> cell surface expression only in the case of a functional abca <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our model system allows a quantitative detection of cell surface expression of abca <dig>  screening of substrates or specific inhibitors, and investigating transport regulation.
