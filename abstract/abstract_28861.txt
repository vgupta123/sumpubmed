BACKGROUND
high mobility group a  proteins regulate gene transcription through architectural modulation of chromatin and the formation of multi-protein complexes on promoter/enhancer regions. differential expression of hmga variants has been found to be important for distinct differentiation processes and deregulated expression was linked to several disorders. here we used mouse c2c <dig> myoblasts and c2c <dig> cells stably over-expressing hmga1a-egfp to study the impact of deregulated hmga <dig> expression levels on cellular differentiation.


RESULTS
we found that induction of the myogenic or osteogenic program of c2c <dig> cells caused an immediate down-regulation of hmga <dig>  in contrast to wild type c2c <dig> cells, an engineered cell line with stable over-expression of hmga1a-egfp failed to differentiate into myotubes. immunolocalization studies demonstrated that sustained hmga1a-egfp expression prevented myotube formation and chromatin reorganization that normally accompanies differentiation. western blot analyses showed that elevated hmga1a-egfp levels affected chromatin composition through either down-regulation of histone h <dig> or premature expression of mecp <dig>  rt-pcr analyses further revealed that sustained hmga1a expression also affected myogenic gene expression and caused either down-regulation of genes such as myod, myogenin, igf <dig>  igf <dig>  igfbp1- <dig> or up-regulation of the transcriptional repressor msx <dig>  interestingly, sirna experiments demonstrated that knock-down of hmga1a was required and sufficient to reactivate the myogenic program in induced hmga1a over-expressing cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate that hmga <dig> down-regulation after induction is required to initiate the myogenic program in c2c <dig> cells. sustained hmga1a expression after induction prevents expression of key myogenic factors. this may be due to specific gene regulation and/or global effects on chromatin. our data further corroborate that altered hmga <dig> levels influence the expression of other chromatin proteins. thus, hmga <dig> is able to establish a specific chromatin composition. this work contributes to the understanding of how differential hmga <dig> expression is involved in chromatin organization during cellular differentiation processes and it may help to comprehend effects of hmga <dig> over-expression occurring in malign or benign tumours.
