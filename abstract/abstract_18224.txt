BACKGROUND
the microbial method for the treatment of azo dye is promising, but the reduction of azo dye is the rate-limiting step. zero valent iron  can enhance microbial azo reduction, but the interactions between microbes and fe <dig> and the potential mechanisms of enhancement remain unclear. here, shewanella decolorationis s <dig>  a typical azo-reducing bacterium, was used to characterize the enhancement of fe <dig> on microbial decolorization.


RESULTS
the results indicated that anaerobic iron corrosion was a key inorganic chemical process for the enhancement of fe <dig> on microbial azo reduction, in which oh−, h <dig>  and fe2+ were produced. once fe <dig> was added to the microbial azo reduction system, the proper ph for microbial azo reduction was maintained by oh−, and h <dig> served as the favored electron donor for azo respiration. subsequently, the bacterial biomass yield and viability significantly increased. following the corrosion of fe <dig>  nanometer-scale fe precipitates were adsorbed onto cell surfaces and even accumulated inside cells as observed by transmission electron microscope energy dispersive spectroscopy .


CONCLUSIONS
a conceptual model for fe0-assisted azo dye reduction by strain s <dig> was established to explain the interactions between microbes and fe <dig> and the potential mechanisms of enhancement. this model indicates that the enhancement of microbial azo reduction in the presence of fe <dig> is mainly due to the stimulation of microbial growth and activity by supplementation with elemental iron and h <dig> as an additional electron donor. this study has expanded our knowledge of the enhancement of microbial azo reduction by fe <dig> and laid a foundation for the development of fe0-microbial integrated azo dye wastewater treatment technology.
