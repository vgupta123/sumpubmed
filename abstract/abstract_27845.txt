BACKGROUND
the physiological effects of prostaglandin e <dig>  and prostaglandin e <dig>  are mediated by the prostaglandin e receptor subtypes ep <dig>  ep <dig>  ep <dig>  and ep <dig>  and the respective agonists have been purified. pge <dig> and pge <dig> can increase the production of vascular endothelial growth factor , particularly through ep <dig> and ep <dig>  the biological effects of vegf are mediated by the phosphotyrosine kinase receptors fms-related tyrosine kinase- <dig>  and fetal liver kinase- <dig> . here we examined the effects of ep <dig> and ep <dig> agonists on the production of vegf proteins and vegf messenger rnas  in the inner ear, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. we also examined the localization of ep <dig>  vegf, flt- <dig>  and flk- <dig> in the cochlea by immunohistochemistry.


RESULTS
the expression of ep <dig> occurred in the cochlea, and the local application of an ep <dig> or ep <dig> agonist increased vegf protein and vegf mrna levels in the inner ear. furthermore, the intensity of the vegf immunoreactivity in the spiral ganglion appeared to be increased by the local ep <dig> or ep <dig> agonist treatment. immunoreactivity for flt- <dig>  and flk- <dig> was found in the cochlear sensory epithelium, spiral ganglion, spiral ligament, and stria vascularis.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings demonstrate that ep <dig> and ep <dig> agonists stimulate vegf production in the inner ear, particularly in the spiral ganglions. moreover, the flt- <dig> and flk- <dig> expression observed in the present study suggests that vegf has autocrine and paracrine actions in the cochlea. thus, ep <dig> and ep <dig> might be involved in the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of pge <dig> on acute sensorineural hearing loss via vegf production.
