BACKGROUND
transfer of learning facilitates the efficient mastery of various skills without practicing all possible sensory-motor repertoires. the present study assessed whether motor practice at a submaximal speed, which is typical in sports and music performance, results in an increase in a maximum speed of finger movements of trained and untrained skills.


RESULTS
piano practice of sequential finger movements at a submaximal speed over days progressively increased the maximum speed of trained movements. this increased maximum speed of finger movements was maintained two months after the practice. the learning transferred within the hand to some extent, but not across the hands.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study confirmed facilitation of fast finger movements following a piano practice at a submaximal speed. in addition, the findings indicated the intra-manual transfer effects of piano practice on the maximum speed of skilled finger movements.
