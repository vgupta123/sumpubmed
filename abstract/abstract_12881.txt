BACKGROUND
rna interference  was originally identified as a biological process in which short double-stranded rna  suppress the expression of genes complimentary to the dsrna. this cellular intrinsic gene silencing mechanism has subsequently been developed as a useful tool for studies of gene function. a major strategy for producing small interfering rna  in cultured cells involves the use of sirna expression vectors in which a rna polymerase iii  promoter and transcription stop signal are designed to constitute a functional sirna expression cassette for production of sirna. however, most of the available vectors contain only one sirna expression cassette.


RESULTS
in order to maximize the efficiency and versatility of the vector-based sirna approach, we have developed vectors containing multiple  tandem sirna expression cassettes. moreover, we demonstrated that these vectors can be used not only to produce different sirna to simultaneously suppress the expression of multiple genes but also to maximize the silencing of a singe gene.


CONCLUSIONS
the vectors containing multiple sirna expression cassettes can serve as useful tools for maximizing the efficiency of gene silencing.
