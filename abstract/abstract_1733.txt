BACKGROUND
cytokines of the transforming growth factor β  superfamily exert effects on proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation in various cell types. cancer cells frequently acquire resistance to the anti-proliferative signals of tgf-β, which can be due to mutations in proteins of the signalling cascade. we compared the tgf-β-related signalling properties in b-cell lymphoma cell lines that were sensitive or resistant to tgf-β-induced anti-proliferative effects.


RESULTS
tgf-β sensitive cell lines expressed higher cell surface levels of the activin receptor-like kinase  <dig> , a tgf-β receptor type  <dig>  the expression levels of the other tgf-β and bone morphogenetic protein receptors were comparable in the different cell lines. tgf-β-induced phosphorylation of smad <dig> was similar in tgf-β sensitive and resistant cell lines. in contrast, activation of smad1/ <dig> was restricted to cells that were sensitive to growth inhibition by tgf-β. moreover, with activin a we detected limited anti-proliferative effects, strong phosphorylation of smad <dig>  but no smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation. up-regulation of the tgf-β target genes id <dig> and pai- <dig> was identified in the tgf-β sensitive cell lines. constitutive phosphorylation of mapk p <dig> was restricted to the tgf-β sensitive cell lines. inhibition of p <dig> mapk led to reduced sensitivity to tgf-β.


CONCLUSIONS
we suggest that phosphorylation of smad1/ <dig> is important for the anti-proliferative effects of tgf-β in b-cell lymphoma. alk- <dig> was highly expressed in the sensitive cell lines, and might be important for signalling through smad1/ <dig>  our results indicate a role for p <dig> mapk in the regulation of tgf-β-induced anti-proliferative effects.
