BACKGROUND
the resurgence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis  and hiv associated tuberculosis  are of serious global concern. to contain this situation, new anti-tuberculosis drugs and reduced treatment regimens are imperative. recently, a nitroimidazole, pa- <dig>  has been shown to be active against both replicating and non-replicating bacteria. it is activated by the enzyme deazaflavin-dependent nitroreductase  present in mycobacterium tuberculosis which catalyzes the reduction of pa- <dig>  resulting in the release of lethal reactive nitrogen species  within the bacteria. in this context, pa- <dig> was analyzed for its activity against latent tuberculosis under anaerobic conditions and compared with rifampicin  and pyrazinamide . recent mutagenesis studies have identified a76e mutation which affects the above mentioned catalysis and leads to pa- <dig> resistance. hence, novel analogues which could cope up with their binding to mutant ddn receptor were also identified through this study.


RESULTS
pa- <dig> at an optimum concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml showed enhanced bactericidal activity, resulting in 0 cfu/ml growth when compared to rif and pza at normal ph and anaerobic condition. further docking studies revealed that a combinatorial structure of pa- <dig> conjugated with moxifloxacin  has the highest binding affinity with the wild type and mutant ddn receptor.


CONCLUSIONS
pa- <dig> has been demonstrated to have better activity under anaerobic condition at  <dig>  μg/ml, indicating an optimized dose that is required for overcoming the detoxifying mechanisms of m. tuberculosis and inducing its death. further, the development of resistance through a76e mutation could be overcome through the in silico evolved ligand  <dig>
