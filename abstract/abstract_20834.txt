BACKGROUND
alpha adrenergic drugs are usually used in the treatment of erectile and ejaculatory dysfunction in humans. the influence of such drugs on the seminal characteristics of wild animals has not been verified; whereas their impact on the seminal characteristics and erectile and ejaculatory functions of collared peccaries  has already been determined. this study aimed at investigating and comparing the effects of medetomidine and atipamezole on the seminal variables of collared peccaries undergoing electroejaculation as well as at determining whether these drugs affected the erectile and ejaculatory functions of this species.


RESULTS
a statistically significant difference in sperm concentration was observed between ap  and mp ; however, both these treatments did not differ from p treatment . no statistically significant difference was observed among all treatments with regard to erectile function. with regard to ejaculation time, no significant difference was observed between the mp and ap treatments; however, when compared with the p treatment, ap exhibited a significantly higher difference.


CONCLUSIONS
when collared peccaries were anesthetized with propofol, neither medetomidine nor atipamezole significantly affected the characteristics of the semen or the erectile function, despite the fact that the ap treatment increased ejaculation time. therefore, the data indicate that using propofol alone is an effective anesthetic protocol for collecting semen in collared peccaries. other non-injectable anesthetic drugs, such as inhaled anesthetics, may be used in future research to collect semen from peccaries.
