BACKGROUND
serine hydroxymethyltransferase  is the key enzyme in l-serine enzymatic production, suggesting the importance of obtaining a shmt with high activity.


RESULTS
here, a novel shmt gene, glya, was obtained through degenerate oligonucleotide-primed pcr and encoded a novel shmt with  <dig> % similarity to the known shmt from escherichia coli. the obtained protein anshmt showed the optimal activity at 40°c and ph  <dig> , and was more stable in weakly alkali conditions  than hyphomicrobium methylovorum’s shmt , in order to improve the catalytic efficiency of the wild type, the site-directed mutagenesis based on sequences alignment and bioinformatics prediction, was used and the catalytic efficiency of the mutant i249l was found to be  <dig> -fold higher than that of the wild-type, with the replacement of isoleucine by leucine at the  <dig> position.


CONCLUSIONS
this research provides useful information about the interesting site, and the application of dop-pcr in cloning a novel glya gene.
