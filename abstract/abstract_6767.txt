BACKGROUND
chromosomes reorganize in early meiotic prophase to form the so-called telomere bouquet. in fission yeast, telomeres localize to the nuclear periphery via interaction of the telomeric protein rap <dig> with the membrane protein bqt <dig>  during meiotic prophase, the meiotic proteins bqt1- <dig> bind rap <dig> and tether to the spindle pole body to form the bouquet. although it is known that this polarized chromosomal arrangement plays a crucial role in meiotic progression, the molecular mechanisms of telomere bouquet regulation are poorly understood.


RESULTS
here, we detected high levels of rap <dig> phospho-modification throughout meiotic prophase, and identified a maximum of  <dig> phosphorylation sites. concomitant phosphomimetic mutation of the modification sites suggests that rap <dig> hyper-phosphorylation does not directly regulate telomere bouquet formation or dissociation. despite the negative charge conferred by its highly phosphorylated state, rap <dig> maintains interactions with its binding partners. interestingly, mutations that change the charge of negatively charged residues within the bqt1- <dig> binding site of rap <dig> abolished the affinity to the bqt1- <dig> complex, suggesting that the intrinsic negative charge of rap <dig> is crucial for telomere bouquet formation.


CONCLUSIONS
whereas rap <dig> hyper-phosphorylation observed in meiotic prophase does not have an apparent role in bouquet formation, the intrinsic negative charge of rap <dig> is important for forming interactions with its binding partners. thus, rap <dig> is able to retain bouquet formation under heavily phosphorylated status.
