BACKGROUND
chondrogenesis and subsequent endochondral ossification are processes tightly regulated by the transcription factor sox <dig> , but molecular mechanisms underlying this activity remain unclear. here we report that coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase  <dig>  regulates chondrocyte proliferation via arginine methylation of sox <dig> 


RESULTS
carm1-null mice display delayed endochondral ossification and decreased chondrocyte proliferation. conversely, cartilage development of carm <dig> transgenic mice was accelerated. carm <dig> specifically methylates sox <dig> at its hmg domain in vivo and in vitro. arg-methylation of sox <dig> by carm <dig> disrupts interaction of sox <dig> with beta-catenin, regulating cyclin d <dig> expression and cell cycle progression of chondrocytes.


CONCLUSIONS
these results establish a role for carm <dig> as an important regulator of chondrocyte proliferation during embryogenesis.
