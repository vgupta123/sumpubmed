BACKGROUND
the vast majority of oocytes formed in the fetal ovary do not survive beyond birth. possible reasons for their loss include the elimination of non-viable genetic constitutions arising through meiosis, however, the precise relationship between meiotic stages and prenatal apoptosis of oocytes remains elusive. we studied oocytes in mouse fetal and neonatal ovaries,  <dig> â€“ <dig> days post coitum, to examine the relationship between oocyte development and programmed cell death during meiotic prophase i.


RESULTS
microspreads of fetal and neonatal ovarian cells underwent immunocytochemistry for meiosis- and apoptosis-related markers. cor- <dig>  highlighted axial elements of the synaptonemal complex and allowed definitive identification of the stages of meiotic prophase i. labelling for cleaved poly- polymerase , an inactivated dna repair protein, indicated apoptosis. the same oocytes were then labelled for dna double strand breaks  using tunel.  <dig> oocytes produced analysable results.

oocytes at all stages of meiotic prophase i stained for cleaved parp- <dig> and/or tunel, or neither. oocytes with fragmented  or compressed  axial elements showed slight but significant differences in staining for cleaved parp- <dig> and tunel to those with intact elements. however, fragmentation of axial elements alone was not a good indicator of cell demise. cleaved parp- <dig> and tunel staining were not necessarily coincident, showing that tunel is not a reliable marker of apoptosis in oocytes.


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that apoptosis can occur throughout meiotic prophase i in mouse fetal and early postnatal oocytes, with greatest incidence at the diplotene stage. careful selection of appropriate markers for oocyte apoptosis is essential.
