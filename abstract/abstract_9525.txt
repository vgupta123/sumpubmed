BACKGROUND
mugwort pollen allergens represent the main cause of pollinosis in late summer. the major allergen, art v  <dig>  contains only one single immunodominant, solely hla-dr-restricted t cell epitope . the frequency of hla-drb1* <dig> is highly increased in mugwort-allergic individuals and hla-dr <dig> serves as restriction element for art v 125- <dig>  however, art v 125- <dig> also binds to hla-dr <dig> with high affinity and dr1-restricted art v 125- <dig> -specific t cell receptors can be activated by hla-dr <dig> molecules. to understand the predominance of hla-dr <dig> in mugwort allergy in spite of the degeneracy in hla/peptide-binding and tcr-recognition, we investigated the molecular background of art v 125- <dig> /mhc/tcr interactions in the context of hla-dr <dig> compared to -dr <dig> 


RESULTS
the majority of art v 125- <dig> -specific t cell lines and clones from hla-dr <dig> carrying, mugwort pollen-allergic donors reacted to synthetic and naturally processed art v 1â€“peptides when presented by hla-dr <dig> or hla-dr <dig> expressing antigen presenting cells. however, at limiting peptide concentrations dr <dig> was more effective in t cell stimulation. in addition, the minimal epitope for 50% of art v 125- <dig> -specific t cells was shorter for dr <dig> than for dr <dig>  in vitro binding assays of art v 125- <dig> mutant peptides to isolated dr1- and dr4-molecules indicated similar binding capacities and use of the same register. in silico simulation of art v 125- <dig> binding to hla-dr <dig> and -dr <dig> suggested similar binding of the central part of the peptide to either molecule, but a higher flexibility of the n- and c-terminal amino acids and detachment at the c-terminus in hla-dr <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the predominance of hla-dr <dig> in the response to art v 125- <dig> may be explained by subtle conformation changes of the peptide bound to dr <dig> compared to dr <dig>  computer simulation supported our experimental data by demonstrating differences in peptide mobility within the hla-dr complex that may influence tcr-binding. we suggest that the minor differences observed in vitro may be more relevant in the microenvironment in vivo, so that only presentation by hla-dr <dig>  but not -dr <dig> permits successful t cell activation.
