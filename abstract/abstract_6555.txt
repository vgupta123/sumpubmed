BACKGROUND
recent methodological advances allow better examination of speciation and extinction processes and patterns. a major open question is the origin of large discrepancies in species number between groups of the same age. existing frameworks to model this diversity either focus on changes between lineages, neglecting global effects such as mass extinctions, or focus on changes over time which would affect all lineages. yet it seems probable that both lineages differences and mass extinctions affect the same groups.


RESULTS
here we used simulations to test the performance of two widely used methods under complex scenarios of diversification. we report good performances, although with a tendency to over-predict events with increasing complexity of the scenario.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, we find that lineage shifts are better detected than mass extinctions. this work has significance to assess the methods currently used to estimate changes in diversification using phylogenetic trees. our results also point toward the need to develop new models of diversification to expand our capabilities to analyse realistic and complex evolutionary scenarios.
