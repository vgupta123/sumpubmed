BACKGROUND
numerous human genes encode potentially active dna transposases or recombinases, but our understanding of their functions remains limited due to shortage of methods to profile their activities on endogenous genomic substrates.


RESULTS
to enable functional analysis of human transposase-derived genes, we combined forward chemical genetic hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase  <dig>  screening with massively parallel paired-end dna sequencing and structural variant genome assembly and analysis. here, we report the hprt <dig> mutational spectrum induced by the human transposase pgbd <dig>  including pgbd5-specific signal sequences  that serve as potential genomic rearrangement substrates.


CONCLUSIONS
the discovered pss motifs and high-throughput forward chemical genomic screening approach should prove useful for the elucidation of endogenous genome remodeling activities of pgbd <dig> and other domesticated human dna transposases and recombinases.
