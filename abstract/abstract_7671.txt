BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori forms biofilms on glass surfaces at the air-liquid interface in in vitro batch cultures; however, biofilms of h. pylori have not been well characterized. in the present study, we analyzed the ability of h. pylori strains to form biofilms and characterized the underlying mechanisms of h. pylori biofilm formation.


RESULTS
strain tk <dig> showed strong biofilm forming ability relative to the other strains in brucella broth supplemented with 7% fcs. the strong biofilm forming ability of tk <dig> is reflected the relative thickness of the biofilms. in addition, outer membrane vesicles  were detected within the matrix of only the tk <dig> biofilms. biofilm formation was strongly correlated with the production of omv in this strain. we further observed that strain tk <dig> did not form thick biofilms in brucella broth supplemented with  <dig> % Î²-cyclodextrin. however, the addition of the omv-fraction collected from tk <dig> could enhance biofilm formation.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggested that omv produced from tk <dig> play an important role in biofilm formation in strain tk <dig>
