BACKGROUND
the flowering process in plants proceeds through the induction of an inflorescence meristem triggered by several pathways. many of the genes associated with both the flowering process and floral architecture encode transcription factors of the mads domain family. gerbera, a member of the sunflower family, asteraceae, bears compressed inflorescence heads  with three different flower types characterized by differences in both sexuality and floral symmetry. to understand how such a complex inflorescence structure is achieved at the molecular level, we have characterized the array of gerbera mads box genes. the high number of squamosa-like genes in gerbera compared to other model species raised the question as to whether they may relate to gerbera's complex inflorescence structure and whether or not a homeotic a function is present.


RESULTS
in this paper we describe six gerbera genes related to the squamosa/apetala1/fruitfull genes of snapdragon and arabidopsis. based on phylogenetic analysis of the entire gene lineage, our data indicates that gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig> are members of the squa/ap <dig> clade, while gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig> are co-orthologs of the arabidopsis ful gene. gsqua1/gsqua <dig> and gsqua4/gsqua5/gsqua <dig>  respectively, represent several gene duplication events unknown in the model systems that may be specific to either gerbera or asteraceae. gsqua genes showed specific expression profiles. gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig>  and gsqua <dig> were inflorescence abundant, while gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig>  and gsqua <dig> expression was also detected in vegetative organs. overexpression of gsqua <dig> in gerbera led to accelerated flowering, dwarfism and vegetative abnormalities, all new and specific phenomena observed in transgenic gerbera plants with modified mads box gene expression.


CONCLUSIONS
based on expression patterns, none of the gerbera squa-like genes are likely to control flower organ identity in the sense of the floral a function. however, our data shows that the ful-like gene gsqua <dig> plays a vital role in meristem transition. the roles of other gsqua-genes in gerbera floral development are intriguing, but require still further study.
