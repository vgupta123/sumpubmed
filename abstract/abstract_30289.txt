BACKGROUND
apoptosis is important for regulating spermatogenesis. the protein mrhbdd <dig> /rrhbdd <dig>  is highly expressed in the testis and is involved in apoptosis of spermatogonia. gc- <dig>  a spermatogonia cell line, has the capacity to differentiate into spermatids within the seminiferous tubules. we constructed mrhbdd <dig> knockdown gc- <dig> cells and evaluated their capacity to differentiate into spermatids in mouse seminiferous tubules.


RESULTS
stable mrhbdd <dig> knockdown gc- <dig> cells were sensitive to apoptotic stimuli, ps <dig> and uv irradiation. in vitro, they survived and proliferated normally. however, they lost the ability to survive and differentiate in mouse seminiferous tubules.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that mrhbdd <dig> may be associated with mammalian spermatogenesis.
