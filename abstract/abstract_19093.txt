BACKGROUND
it has been hypothesized that alterations of the serotonergic system contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms in alzheimer disease . cellular expressions of the two serotonergic receptors 5-ht2a and 5-ht <dig> have therefore been determined by immunohistochemistry in the prefrontal cortex of patients with ad  and normal age-matched controls .


RESULTS
in normal aging patients, 5-ht2a label was mainly observed in large pyramidal cells, but to a lesser extent also in small pyramidal cells and in stellate cells of cortical layers ii-vi. in ad, a similar distribution was observed, but density of positive cells was significantly reduced by 33%. in aging control patients, the 5-ht <dig> receptor was expressed by pyramidal cells and occasional stellate cells, not only of layers ii-v, but also of layer i, where a distinct label was observed in neurons and surrounding fibers. 5-ht <dig> receptor expression in ad patients had the same pattern, but was significantly decreased by 40%.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that a decline in neurons expressing 5-ht2a, but also 5-ht <dig> receptors may play a role in the etiopathology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in ad.
