BACKGROUND
bovine tuberculosis  in wildlife species poses a threat to domestic livestock in many situations. control programs for btb in livestock depend on testing and slaughtering the positive animals; however, the currently available diagnostic tests often have poor specificity. in our previous study, we developed a specific and sensitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay  for another mycobacterial disease – johne’s disease, using surface antigens of mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis  extracted by briefly agitating the bacilli in 80% ethanol solution. the elisa test was named ethanol vortex elisa . the objective of this study is to examine whether evelisa technique could be used to specifically detect anti-mycobacterium bovis  antibodies in the serum of m. bovis-infected farmed red deer . we tested a total of  <dig> red deer serum samples, divided in  <dig> groups – uninfected animals , experimentally infected with m. bovis  and experimentally infected with map .


RESULTS
the presence of anti-m. bovis antibodies was tested using an ethanol extract of m. bovis. without absorption of anti-map cross reactive antibodies, it was found that  <dig> out of the  <dig> map-infected animals showed high antibody binding. using heat killed map as an absorbent of cross reactive antibodies, anti-m. bovis antibodies were detected in  <dig> % of m. bovis-infected animals with minor false positive results caused by map infection.


CONCLUSIONS
the results from this study suggest that evelisa may form a basis for a sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of btb in farmed red deer.
