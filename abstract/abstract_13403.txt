BACKGROUND
despite many efforts, little is known about distribution and interactions of chromatin proteins which contribute to the specificity of chromomeric organization of interphase chromosomes. to address this issue, we used publicly available datasets from several recent drosophila genome-wide mapping and annotation projects, in particular, those from modencode project, and compared molecular organization of  <dig> interband regions which were accurately mapped previously.


RESULTS
here we demonstrate that in interphase chromosomes of drosophila cell lines, the interband regions are enriched for a specific set of proteins generally characteristic of the "open" chromatin , beaf- <dig>  bre <dig>  dmi- <dig>  gaf, nurf <dig>  wds and trx). these regions also display reduced nucleosome density, histone h <dig> depletion and pronounced enrichment for orc <dig>  a pre-replication complex component. within the  <dig> interband regions analyzed, most were around 3- <dig> kb long, particularly those where many of said protein features were present. we estimate there are about  <dig> regions with similar properties in chromosomes of d. melanogaster cell lines, which fits quite well the number of cytologically observed interbands in salivary gland polytene chromosomes.


CONCLUSIONS
our observations suggest strikingly similar organization of interband chromatin in polytene chromosomes and in chromosomes from cell lines thereby reflecting the existence of a universal principle of interphase chromosome organization.
