BACKGROUND
cadmium  is a severe detrimental environmental pollutant. to adapt to cd-induced deleterious effects, plants have evolved sophisticated defence mechanisms. in this study, a genome-wide transcriptome analysis was performed to identify the mechanisms of cd tolerance using two barley genotypes with distinct cd tolerance.


RESULTS
microarray expression profiling revealed that  <dig> genes were up-regulated by cd in cd-tolerant genotype weisuobuzhi and simultaneously down-regulated or non-changed in cd-sensitive dong <dig>  and  <dig> genes showed no change in weisuobuzhi but down-regulated in dong <dig>  novel genes that may play significant roles in cd tolerance were mainly via generating protectants such as catalase against reactive oxygen species, cd compartmentalization , and defence response and dna replication . other  <dig> up-regulated genes in both genotypes also included those encoding proteins related to stress and defence responses, and metabolism-related genes involved in detoxification pathways. meanwhile, biochemical and physiological analysis of enzyme , phytohormone , ion distribution and transport  demonstrated that significantly larger cd-induced increases of those components in weisuobuzhi than those in dong <dig>  in addition, cd-induced dna damage was more pronounced in dong <dig> than that in weisuobuzhi.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that combining microarray, physiological and biochemical analysis has provided valuable insights towards a novel integrated molecular mechanism of cd tolerance in barley. the higher expression genes in cd tolerant genotype could be used for transgenic overexpression in sensitive genotypes of barley or other cereal crops for elevating tolerance to cd stress.
