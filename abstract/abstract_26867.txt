BACKGROUND
electroacupuncture  pretreatment can induce the tolerance against focal cerebral ischemia. however, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood. emerging evidences suggest that canonical notch signaling may be involved in ischemic brain injury. in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that ea pretreatment-induced tolerance against focal cerebral ischemia is mediated by notch signaling.


RESULTS
ea pretreatment significantly enhanced notch <dig>  notch <dig> and jag <dig> gene transcriptions in the striatum, except notch <dig> intracellular domain level, which could be increased evidently by ischemia. after ischemia and reperfusion, hes <dig> mrna and notch <dig> intracellular domain level in ischemic striatum in ea pretreatment group were increased and reached the peak at 2 h and 24 h, respectively, which were both earlier than the peak achieved in control group. intraventricular injection with the γ-secretase inhibitor mw <dig> attenuated the neuroprotective effect of ea pretreatment.


CONCLUSIONS
ea pretreatment induces the tolerance against focal cerebral ischemia through activation of canonical notch pathway.
