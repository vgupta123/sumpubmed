BACKGROUND
much of the morbidity associated with short bowel syndrome  is attributed to effects of decreased enteral nutrition and administration of total parenteral nutrition . we hypothesized that acute sbs alone has significant effects on gene expression beyond epithelial proliferation, and tested this in a zebrafish sbs model.

methods
in a model of sbs in zebrafish  or sham  surgery, rna-seq was performed after 2 weeks. the proximal intestine was harvested and rna isolated. the three samples from each group with the highest amount of rna were spiked with external rna controls consortium  controls, sequenced and aligned to reference genome with gene ontology  enrichment analysis performed. gene expression of ctnnb <dig>  ccnb <dig>  ccnd <dig>  cyp7a1a, dkk <dig>  ifng1- <dig>  igf2a, il1b, lef <dig>  nos2b, saa <dig>  stat <dig>  tnfa and wnt5a were confirmed to be elevated in sbs by rt-qpcr.


RESULTS
rna-seq analysis identified  <dig> significantly upregulated genes and  <dig> significantly downregulated genes in sbs zebrafish intestine compared to sham with ingenuity analysis. the upregulated genes were involved in cell proliferation, acute phase response signaling, innate and adaptive immunity, bile acid regulation, production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, cellular barrier and coagulation. the downregulated genes were involved in folate synthesis, gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, fatty-acid oxidation and activation and drug and steroid metabolism. rt-qpcr confirmed gene expression differences from rna-sequencing.


CONCLUSIONS
changes of gene expression after 2 weeks of sbs indicate complex and extensive alterations of multiple pathways, some previously implicated as effects of tpn. the systemic sequelae of sbs alone are significant and indicate multiple targets for investigating future therapies.
