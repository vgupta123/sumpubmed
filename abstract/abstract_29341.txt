BACKGROUND
while multiple alignment is the first step of usual classification schemes for biological sequences, alignment-free methods are being increasingly used as alternatives when multiple alignments fail. subword-based combinatorial methods are popular for their low algorithmic complexity  or exhaustivity , in general with fixed length word and/or number of mismatches. we developed previously a method to detect local similarities  based on the occurrences of repeated subwords of fixed length, which does not impose a fixed number of mismatches. the resulting similarities are, for some "good" values of n, sufficiently relevant to form the basis of a reliable alignment-free classification. the aim of this paper is to develop a method that uses the similarities detected by n-local decoding while not imposing a fixed value of n. we present a procedure that selects for every position in the sequences an adaptive value of n, and we implement it as the ms <dig> classification tool.


RESULTS
among the equivalence classes produced by the n-local decodings for all n, we select a  small number of "relevant" classes corresponding to variable length subwords that carry enough information to perform the classification. the parameter n, for which correct values are data-dependent and thus hard to guess, is here replaced by the average repetitivity κ of the sequences. we show that our approach yields classifications of several sets of hiv/siv sequences that agree with the accepted taxonomy, even on usually discarded repetitive regions .


CONCLUSIONS
the method ms <dig> satisfactorily classifies a set of sequences that are notoriously hard to align. this suggests that our approach forms the basis of a reliable alignment-free classification tool. the only parameter κ of ms <dig> seems to give reasonable results even for its default value, which can be a great advantage for sequence sets for which little information is available.
