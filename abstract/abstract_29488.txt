BACKGROUND
apomixis or asexual seed formation represents a potentially important agronomic trait whose introduction into crop plants could be an effective way to fix and perpetuate a desirable genotype through successive seed generations. however, the gene regulatory pathways underlying apomixis remain unknown. in particular, the potential function of micrornas, which are known to play crucial roles in many aspects of plant growth and development, remains to be determined with regards to the switch from sexual to apomictic reproduction.


RESULTS
using bioinformatics and microarray validation procedures,  <dig> mirna families conserved among angiosperms were identified in boechera. microarray assay confirmed  <dig> of the mirna families that were identified by bioinformatics techniques.  <dig> cdna sequences representing  <dig> mirnas could fold back into stable pre-mirnas.  <dig> of these pre-mirnas had mirnas with boechera-specific nucleotide substitutions . analysis of the gibbs free energy  of these pre-mirna stem-loops with nss showed that the boechera-specific mirna nss significantly  enhance the stability of stem-loops. furthermore, six transcription factors, the squamosa promoter binding protein like spl <dig>  spl <dig> and spl <dig>  myb domain protein  <dig> , related to ap <dig>  dna binding  and tcp family transcription factor  <dig>  were found to be expressed in sexual or apomictic ovules. however, only spl <dig> showed differential expression with significant  up-regulation at the megaspore mother cell  stage of ovule development in apomictic genotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
this study constitutes the first extensive insight into the conservation and expression of micrornas in boechera sexual and apomictic species. the mir156/ <dig> target squamosa promoter binding protein-like  <dig>  was found differentially expressed with significant  up-regulation at the mmc stage of ovule development in apomictic genotypes. the results also demonstrate that nucleotide changes in mature mirnas significantly  enhance the thermodynamic stability of pre-mirna stem-loops.
