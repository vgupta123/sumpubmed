BACKGROUND
adult human fibroblasts grown in low oxygen and with fgf <dig> supplementation have the capacity to tip the healing outcome of skeletal muscle injury â€“ by favoring regeneration response in vivo over scar formation. here, we compare the transcriptomes of control adult human dermal fibroblasts and induced regeneration-competent  fibroblasts to identify transcriptional changes that may be related to their regeneration competence.


RESULTS
we identified a unique gene-expression profile that characterizes fgf2-induced irc fibroblast phenotype. significantly differentially expressed genes due to fgf <dig> treatment were identified and analyzed to determine overrepresented gene ontology terms. genes belonging to extracellular matrix components, adhesion molecules, matrix remodelling, cytoskeleton, and cytokines were determined to be affected by fgf <dig> treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
transcriptome analysis comparing control adult human fibroblasts with fgf2-treated fibroblasts identified functional groups of genes that reflect transcriptional changes potentially contributing to their regeneration competence. this comparative transcriptome analysis should contribute new insights into genes that characterize cells with greater regenerative potential.
