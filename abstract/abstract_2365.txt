BACKGROUND
a clear association of amino acid variation in the prion protein gene  with susceptibility and resistance to classical scrapie exists in sheep, but not in goats. in this study we examined dna sequence variation in the prnp of  <dig> animals from two scrapie-infected herds of saanen dairy goats, and identified  <dig> non-synonymous variants in the coding region.


RESULTS
in the larger herd, all of the  <dig> scrapie-affected goats tested had at least one allele with the arginine  codon at position  <dig>  with  <dig> being homozygous for that variant. no animal homozygous for the glutamine  codon at  <dig> were affected and only two heterozygotes  were affected. a weak association was found at position  <dig> and no significant associations were found with amino acid variation at the remaining four variant positions , however, the allelic variation was low. similar patterns were observed in the second scrapie-affected herd.


CONCLUSIONS
we also evaluated previous studies on goat herds affected with scrapie and this relationship of r susceptibility and q resistance at  <dig> was present independent of the genotypes at the other positions including  <dig>  the fact that glutamine at  <dig> provides a significant protective property to scrapie irrespective of the other positions could be important for breeding strategies aimed at improving herd resistance to scrapie, while maintaining important productivity traits.
