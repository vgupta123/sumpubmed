BACKGROUND
Α-gliadins form a multigene protein family encoded by multiple α-gliadin  genes at three genomic loci, gli-a <dig>  gli-b <dig> and gli-d <dig>  respectively located on the homoeologous wheat chromosomes 6as, 6bs, and 6ds. these proteins contain a number of important celiac disease -immunogenic domains. the α-gliadins expressed from the gli-b <dig> locus harbour fewer conserved cd-epitopes than those from gli-a <dig>  whereas the gli-d <dig> gliadins have the highest cd-immunogenic potential. in order to detect differences in the highly cd-immunogenic α-gliadin fraction we determined the relative expression level from the homoeologous gli- <dig> loci in various tetraploid and hexaploid wheat genotypes by using a quantitative pyrosequencing method and by analyzing expressed sequence tag  sequences.


RESULTS
we detected large differences in relative expression levels of α-gliadin genes from the three homoeologous loci among wheat genotypes, both as relative numbers of expressed sequence tag  sequences from specific varieties and when using a quantitative pyrosequencing assay specific for gli-a <dig> genes. the relative gli-a <dig> expression level in a tetraploid durum wheat cultivar  was 41%. in genotypes derived from landraces, the gli-a <dig> frequency varied between 12% and 58%. in some advanced hexaploid bread wheat cultivars the genes from locus gli-b <dig> were hardly expressed  but in others they made up more than 40% .


CONCLUSIONS
here, we have shown that large differences exist in relative expression levels of α-gliadins from the homoeologous gli- <dig> loci among wheat genotypes. since the homoelogous genes differ in the amount of conserved cd-epitopes, screening for differential expression from the homoeologous gli- <dig> loci can be employed for the pre-selection of wheat varieties in the search for varieties with very low cd-immunogenic potential. pyrosequencing is a method that can be employed for such a 'gene family-specific quantitative transcriptome profiling'.
