BACKGROUND
cutaneous mast cell tumours are one of the most common neoplasms in dogs and show a highly variable biologic behaviour. several prognosis tools have been proposed for canine mast cell tumours, including histological grading and cell proliferation markers. cd <dig> is a receptor tyrosine kinase thought to play a key role in human and canine mast cell neoplasms. normal  and aberrant  cd <dig> immunoexpression patterns have been identified in canine mast cell tumours. cytoplasmic cd <dig> expression has been found to correlate with higher histological grade and with a worsened post-surgical prognosis. this study addresses the role of cd <dig> in canine mast cell tumours by studying the correlations between cd <dig> immunoexpression patterns, two proliferation markers  histological grade, and several other pathological variables.


RESULTS
highly significant  correlations were found between cd <dig> immunostaining patterns and histological grade, cell proliferation markers  and tumoral necrosis. highly significant  correlations were also established between the two cellular proliferation markers and histological grade, tumour necrosis and epidermal ulceration. a significant correlation  was observed between cd <dig> expression patterns and epidermal ulceration. no differences were observed between focal and diffuse cytoplasmic cd <dig> staining patterns concerning any of the variables studied.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings highlight the key role of cd <dig> in the biopathology of canine mcts and confirm the relationship between aberrant cd <dig> expression and increased cell proliferation and higher histological grade. further studies are needed to unravel the cellular mechanisms underlying focal and diffuse cytoplasmic cd <dig> staining patterns, and their respective biopathologic relevance.
