BACKGROUND
plant viruses can be employed as versatile vectors for the production of vaccines by expressing immunogenic epitopes on the surface of chimeric viral particles. although several viruses, including tobacco mosaic virus, potato virus x and cowpea mosaic virus, have been developed as vectors, we aimed to develop a new viral vaccine delivery system, a bamboo mosaic virus , that would carry larger transgene loads, and generate better immunity in the target animals with fewer adverse environmental effects.

methods
we engineered the bamv as a vaccine vector expressing the antigenic epitope of the capsid protein vp <dig> of foot-and-mouth disease virus . the recombinant bamv plasmid  was constructed by replacing dna encoding the  <dig> n-terminal amino acid residues of the bamv coat protein with that encoding  <dig> amino acid residues  of fmdv vp <dig> 


RESULTS
the pbvp <dig> was able to infect host plants and to generate a chimeric virion bvp <dig> expressing vp <dig> epitopes in its coat protein. inoculation of swine with bvp <dig> virions resulted in the production of anti-fmdv neutralizing antibodies. real-time pcr analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the bvp1-immunized swine revealed that they produced vp1-specific ifn-Î³. furthermore, all bvp1-immunized swine were protected against fmdv challenge.


CONCLUSIONS
chimeric bamv virions that express partial sequence of fmdv vp <dig> can effectively induce not only humoral and cell-mediated immune responses but also full protection against fmdv in target animals. this bamv-based vector technology may be applied to other vaccines that require correct expression of antigens on chimeric viral particles.
