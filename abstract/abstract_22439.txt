BACKGROUND
functional metagenomics is a promising strategy for the exploration of the biocatalytic potential of microbiomes in order to uncover novel enzymes for industrial processes . most current methodologies used to screen for enzymes involved in plant biomass degradation are based on the use of single substrates. moreover, highly diverse environments are used as metagenomic sources. however, such methods suffer from low hit rates of positive clones and hence the discovery of novel enzymatic activities from metagenomes has been hampered.


RESULTS
here, we constructed fosmid libraries from two wheat straw-degrading microbial consortia, denoted rws  and tws . approximately  <dig>  clones from each library were screened for cellulose-degrading enzymes using a multi-chromogenic substrate approach. the screens yielded  <dig> positive clones for both libraries, giving hit rates of 1: <dig> and 1: <dig>  for rws and tws, respectively. seven clones  were selected for sequence analyses. their inserts revealed the presence of  <dig> genes encoding enzymes belonging to twelve different glycosyl hydrolase families . these encompassed several carbohydrate-active gene clusters traceable mainly to klebsiella related species. detailed functional analyses showed that clone nt2- <dig>  had highest enzymatic activity at 55 °c and ph  <dig> . additionally, clone t5- <dig>  showed > 90 % of enzymatic activity at 55 °c and ph  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
this study employed a high-throughput method for rapid screening of fosmid metagenomic libraries for cellulose-degrading enzymes. the approach, consisting of screens on multi-substrates coupled to further analyses, revealed high hit rates, as compared with recent other studies. two clones, 10bt and t4- <dig>  required the presence of multiple substrates for detectable activity, indicating a new avenue in library activity screening. finally, clones nt2- <dig>  t5- <dig> and nt18- <dig> were found to encode putative novel thermo-alkaline enzymes, which could represent a starting point for further biotechnological applications.
