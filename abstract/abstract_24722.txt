BACKGROUND
relative isotope abundance quantification, which can be used for peptide identification and differential peptide quantification, plays an important role in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry -based proteomics. however, several major issues exist in the relative isotopic quantification of peptides on time-of-flight  instruments: lc peak boundary detection, thermal noise suppression, interference removal and mass drift correction. we propose to use the maximum ratio combining  method to extract ms signal templates for interference detection/removal and lc peak boundary detection. in our method, mrcquant, ms templates are extracted directly from experimental values, and the mass drift in each lc-ms run is automatically captured and compensated. we compared the quantification accuracy of mrcquant to that of another representative lc-ms quantification algorithm  using datasets downloaded from a public data repository.


RESULTS
mrcquant showed significant improvement in the number of accurately quantified peptides.


CONCLUSIONS
mrcquant effectively addresses major issues in the relative quantification of lc-ms-based proteomics data, and it provides improved performance in the quantification of low abundance peptides.
