BACKGROUND
aluminium  toxicity is considered to be one of the major constraints affecting crop productivity on acid soils. being a trait governed by multiple genes, the identification and characterization of novel transcription factors  regulating the expression of entire response networks is a very promising approach. therefore, the aim of the present study was to clone, localize, and characterize the tastop <dig> gene, which belongs to the zinc finger family  transcription factor, at molecular level in bread wheat.


RESULTS
tastop <dig> loci were cloned and localized on the long arm of homoeologous group  <dig> chromosomes  in bread wheat. tastop <dig> showed four potential zinc finger domains and the homoeologue tastop1-a exhibited transactivation activity in yeast. expression profiling of tastop <dig> transcripts identified the predominance of homoeologue tastop1-a followed by tastop1-d over tastop1-b in root and only predominance of tastop1-a in shoot tissues of two diverse bread wheat genotypes. al and proton  stress appeared to slightly modulate the transcript of tastop <dig> homoeologues expression in both genotypes of bread wheat.


CONCLUSIONS
physical localization of tastop <dig> results indicated the presence of a single copy of tastop <dig> on homoeologous group  <dig> chromosomes in bread wheat. the three homoeologues of tastop <dig> have similar genomic structures, but showed biased transcript expression and different response to al and proton  toxicity. these results indicate that tastop <dig> homoeologues may differentially contribute under al or proton  toxicity in bread wheat. moreover, it seems that tastop1-a transactivation potential is constitutive and may not depend on the presence/absence of al at least in yeast. finally, the localization of tastop <dig> on long arm of homoeologous group  <dig> chromosomes and the previously reported major loci associated with al resistance at chromosome 3bl, through qtl and genome wide association mapping studies suggests that tastop <dig> could be a potential candidate gene for genomic assisted breeding for al tolerance in bread wheat.
