BACKGROUND
dna-based watermarks are helpful tools to identify the unauthorized use of genetically modified organisms  protected by patents. in silico analyses showed that in coding regions synonymous codons can be used to insert encrypted information into the genome of living organisms by using the dna-crypt algorithm.


RESULTS
we integrated an authenticating watermark in the vam <dig> sequence. for our investigations we used a mutant saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, called cg <dig>  which has an amber mutation within the vam <dig> sequence. the cg <dig> cells are unable to sporulate and in addition display an abnormal vacuolar morphology. transformation of cg <dig> with prs <dig> vam <dig> leads to a phenotype very similar to the wildtype yeast strain cg <dig>  the integrated watermark did not influence the function of vam <dig> and the resulting phenotype of the cg <dig> cells transformed with prs <dig> vam7-tb shows no significant differences compared to the cg <dig> cells transformed with prs <dig> vam <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
from our experiments we conclude that the dna watermarks produced by dna-crypt do not influence the translation from mrna into protein. by analyzing the vacuolar morphology, growth rate and ability to sporulate we confirmed that the resulting vam <dig> protein was functionally active.
