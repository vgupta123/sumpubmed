BACKGROUND
the liver x receptors  are oxysterol sensing nuclear receptors with multiple effects on metabolism and immune cells. however, the complete genome-wide cistrome of lxr in cells of human origin has not yet been provided.


RESULTS
we performed chip-seq in phorbol myristate acetate-differentiated thp- <dig> cells  after stimulation with the potent synthetic lxr ligand t <dig> . microarray gene expression analysis was performed in the same cellular model. we identified  <dig> genome-wide lxr locations , of which  <dig> were observed after t <dig> treatment. de novo analysis of lxr binding sequences identified a dr4-type element as the major motif. on mrna level t <dig> up-regulated  <dig> genes and repressed  <dig> genes. our results show that lxr actions are focused on  <dig> genomic regions that contain up to  <dig> t <dig> target genes per region under the control of highly stringent lxr binding sites with individual constellations for each region. we could confirm that lxr controls lipid metabolism and transport and observed a strong association with apoptosis-related functions.


CONCLUSIONS
this first report on genome-wide binding of lxr in a human cell line provides new insights into the transcriptional network of lxr and its target genes with their link to physiological processes, such as apoptosis.

the gene expression microarray and sequence data have been submitted collectively to the ncbi gene expression omnibus http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo under accession number gse <dig>
