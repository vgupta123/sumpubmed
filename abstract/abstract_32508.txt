BACKGROUND
dengue viruses  attach to the host cell surface and subsequently enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. several primary and low affinity co-receptors for this flavivirus have been identified. however, the presence of these binding molecules on the cell surface does not necessarily render the cell susceptible to infection. determination of which of them serve as bona fide receptors for this virus in the vector may be relevant to treating denv infection and in designing control strategies.


RESULTS
 overlay protein binding assay showed two proteins with molecular masses of  <dig> and  <dig> kda .  specific antibodies against these two proteins inhibited cell binding and infection.  both proteins were bound by all four serotypes of dengue virus.  r <dig> and r <dig> were purified by affinity chromatography from ae. aegypti mosquito midguts and from ae albopictus c6/ <dig> cells.  in addition, a protein with molecular mass of  <dig> kda was purified by affinity chromatography from the midgut extracts.  r <dig> and r <dig> from radiolabeled surface membrane proteins of c6/ <dig> cells were immunoprecipitated by antibodies against ae. aegypti midgut.


CONCLUSIONS
our results strongly suggest that r <dig> and r <dig> are receptors for the four serotypes of dengue virus in the midgut cells of ae. aegypti and in c6/ <dig> ae. albopictus cells.
