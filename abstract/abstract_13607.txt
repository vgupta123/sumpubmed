BACKGROUND
the genomes of prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes display a very strong  <dig> bp periodic bias in the distribution of their nucleotides. this bias is present throughout a given genome, both in coding and non-coding sequences. until now this bias remained of unknown origin.


RESULTS
using a technique for analysis of auto-correlations based on linear projection, we identified the sequences responsible for the bias. prokaryotic and lower eukaryotic genomes are covered with ubiquitous patterns that we termed "class a flexible patterns". each pattern is composed of up to ten conserved nucleotides or dinucleotides distributed into a discontinuous motif. each occurrence spans a region up to  <dig> bp in length. they belong to what we named the "flexible pattern" type, in that there is some limited fluctuation in the distances between the nucleotides composing each occurrence of a given pattern. when taken together, these patterns cover up to half of the genome in the majority of prokaryotes. they generate the previously recognized  <dig> bp periodic bias.


CONCLUSIONS
judging from the structure of the patterns, we suggest that they may define a dense network of protein interaction sites in chromosomes.
