BACKGROUND
mycolactones are immunosuppressive and cytotoxic polyketides, comprising five naturally occurring structural variants , produced by different species of very closely related mycobacteria including the human pathogen, mycobacterium ulcerans. in m. ulcerans strain agy <dig>  mycolactone a/b is produced by three highly homologous type i polyketide megasynthases , whose genes  are found on a  <dig> kb plasmid, known as pmum <dig> 


RESULTS
we report here comparative genomic analysis of pmum <dig>  the complete dna sequence of a  <dig> kb megaplasmid  from mycobacterium liflandii 128fxt and partial sequence of two additional pmum replicons, combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric  analysis. these data reveal how pks module and domain differences affecting mlsb correlate with the production of mycolactones e and f. for mycolactone e these differences from mlsb in m. ulcerans agy <dig> include replacement of the at domain of the loading module  and the absence of an entire extension module. for mycolactone f there is also a reduction of one extension module but also a swap of ketoreductase domains that explains the characteristic stereochemistry of the two terminal side-chain hydroxyls, an arrangement unique to mycolactone f


CONCLUSIONS
the mycolactone pks locus on pmum <dig> revealed the same large, three-gene structure and extraordinary pattern of near-identical pks domain sequence repetition as observed in pmum <dig> with greater than  <dig> % nucleotide identity among domains of the same function. intra- and inter-strain comparisons suggest that the extreme sequence homogeneity seen among the mls pks genes is caused by frequent recombination-mediated domain replacement. this work has shed light on the evolution of mycolactone biosynthesis among an unusual group of mycobacteria and highlights the potential of the mls locus to become a toolbox for combinatorial pks biochemistry.
