BACKGROUND
interferon-gamma  and interleukin- <dig>  are multifunctional cytokines that regulate immune responses, cell proliferation, and tumour development and progression, which frequently have functionally opposing roles. the cellular responses to both cytokines are activated via the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription  pathway. during the past  <dig> years, the crosstalk mechanism between the ifn-gamma and il- <dig> pathways has been studied widely and several biological hypotheses have been proposed, but the kinetics and detailed crosstalk mechanism remain unclear.


RESULTS
using established mathematical models and new experimental observations of the crosstalk between the ifn-gamma and il- <dig> pathways, we constructed a new crosstalk model that considers three possible crosstalk levels:  the competition between stat <dig> and stat <dig> for common receptor docking sites;  the mutual negative regulation between socs <dig> and socs3; and  the negative regulatory effects of the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers. a number of simulations were tested to explore the consequences of cross-regulation between the two pathways. the simulation results agreed well with the experimental data, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness and correctness of the model.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we developed a crosstalk model of the ifn-gamma and il- <dig> pathways to theoretically investigate their cross-regulation mechanism. the simulation experiments showed the importance of the three crosstalk levels between the two pathways. in particular, the unbalanced competition between stat <dig> and stat <dig> for ifnr and gp <dig> led to preferential activation of ifn-gamma and il- <dig>  while at the same time the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers enhanced preferential signal transduction by sequestering a fraction of the activated stats. the model provided a good explanation of the experimental observations and provided insights that may inform further research to facilitate a better understanding of the cross-regulation mechanism between the two pathways.
