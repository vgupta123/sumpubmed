BACKGROUND
ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease, is associated with the massive infiltration of neutrophils. although the initial infiltration of neutrophils is beneficial for killing bacteria, it is presumed that persistent infiltration causes tissue damage by releasing antibacterial products as well as inflammatory cytokines. a murine c-type lectin receptor, dendritic cell immunoreceptor  <dig> , is expressed on cd11b+ myeloid cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils. it was reported that dcir <dig> is required to maintain homeostasis of the immune system to prevent autoimmunity, but it is also involved in the development of infectious disease resulting in the enhanced severity of cerebral malaria. however, the role of dcir <dig> in intestinal immune responses during colitis remains unclear. in this study, we investigated the role of dcir <dig> in intestinal inflammation using an experimental colitis model induced with dextran sodium sulfate .


RESULTS
in contrast to wild type  mice, dcir1−/− mice exhibited mild body weight loss during the course of dss colitis accompanied by reduced colonic inflammation. dcir <dig> deficiency caused a reduced accumulation of neutrophils in the inflamed colon on day  <dig> of dss colitis compared with wt mice. consistently, the production of a neutrophil-attracting chemokine, mip- <dig>  was also decreased in the dcir1−/− colon compared with the wt colon on day  <dig>  there were fewer myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils in the inflamed colon of dcir1−/− mice than in that of wt mice. moreover, bone marrow neutrophils from dcir1−/− mice produced less reactive oxygen species  by lipopolysaccharide stimulation than those from wt mice. this suggests that dcir <dig> deficiency decreases the accumulation of tissue destructive neutrophils during dss colitis.


CONCLUSIONS
dcir <dig> enhances the pathogenesis of dss colitis by altering neutrophil recruitment and their functions.
