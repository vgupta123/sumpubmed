BACKGROUND
bovine tuberculosis  is a widespread and endemic disease of cattle in ethiopia. information relating to genotypic characteristics of mycobacterium bovis strains affecting the cattle population in ethiopia is limited. we carried out molecular characterization of m. bovis strains isolated from btb infected cattle using the spoligotyping technique. the relationship between distribution of spoligotypes and recorded variables was also investigated. a new approach that can numerically reflect the degree of genetic polymorphism in a m. bovis population was also developed. the study was conducted from july  <dig> to january  <dig> in cattle slaughtered at five representative abattoirs in ethiopia.


RESULTS
forty-five m. bovis isolates were obtained from  <dig> pathologic tissue specimens collected from  <dig> carcasses with lesions compatible with btb. twelve spoligotypes were identified from  <dig> distinct strains; with sb <dig> as a dominant spoligotype  followed by sb <dig> . comparison of spoligotypes with an m. bovis global database http://www.mbovis.org revealed six new spoligotypes which were subsequently registered in the database with international identification codes of sb <dig>  sb <dig>  sb <dig>  sb <dig>  sb <dig> and sb <dig>  the majority of strains were obtained from cattle slaughtered at addis ababa abattoir. on the basis of the spoligotype evolutionary index, sei , m. bovis isolates from ethiopia were relatively more heterogeneous  compared to isolates from other countries. this might be attributed to extensive livestock movement linked to trading or seasonal migration, high degree of livestock mingling, and also diversities of the country's agricultural and livestock ecosystems, in addition to lack of disease control measures that led to high infection prevalence. multiple spoligotype infection was recorded in nine  of infected carcasses and this may indicate the prevailing high degree of super infection.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provided molecular evidence for the widespread distribution of m. bovis in the cattle population in ethiopia. it also demonstrated a relatively high degree of genetic polymorphism of the isolates. further molecular investigation of m. bovis strains in humans and other domestic animals is recommended in order to elucidate the zoonotic importance as well as reservoirs and pattern of transmission among various hosts.
