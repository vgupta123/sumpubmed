BACKGROUND
intracellular trafficking of mycobacteria is comprehensively dependent on the unusual regulation of host proteins. recently, we have reported that infection of macrophages by mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv  selectively downregulates the expression of pkcα while infection by mycobacterium smegmatis  does not.


RESULTS
based on our earlier study, we have extrapolated for the first time that knockdown of pkcα, impairs phagocytosis of mycobacteria by macrophages while their intracellular survival is drastically increased. mycobacterium bovis bcg  and mycobacterium tuberculosis h37ra  have also been shown to downregulate the expression of pkcα during the infection. since pkng is uniquely expressed in bcg, ra, rv but not in ms and has been reported to promote intracellular survival of mycobacteria, led us to believe that pkng may be involved in such downregulation of pkcα. thp- <dig> cells infected with recombinant ms expressing pkng , showed significant reduction in pkcα expression. in normal thp- <dig> cells survival of ms-g was enhanced as compared to ms, while their behavior in pkcα deficient cells could not be distinguished. the results strongly demonstrate that pathogenic mycobacteria recognize and then inhibit pkcα to circumvent phagocytosis and the hostile environment of macrophages. we emphasize that, this inhibition is controlled by pkng.


CONCLUSIONS
all together, our data reveal a mechanism that shows substantial interdependence of pkcα with pkng, in sustaining mycobacterial infection.
