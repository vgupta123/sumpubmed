BACKGROUND
misfolding and aggregation of proteins into ordered fibrillar structures is associated with a number of severe pathologies, including alzheimer's disease, prion diseases, and type ii diabetes. the rapid accumulation of knowledge about the sequences and structures of these proteins allows using of in silico methods to investigate the molecular mechanisms of their abnormal conformational changes and assembly. however, such an approach requires the collection of accurate data, which are inconveniently dispersed among several generalist databases.


RESULTS
we therefore created a free online knowledge database  dedicated to amyloid precursor proteins and we have performed large scale sequence analysis of the included data. currently, amypdb integrates data on  <dig> families, including  <dig>  proteins from nearly  <dig> organisms. it displays links to more than  <dig>  bibliographic references and  <dig>  3d-structures. a wiki system is available to insert data into the database, providing a sharing and collaboration environment. we generated and analyzed  <dig>  amino acid sequence patterns, reporting highly specific patterns for each amyloid family, along with patterns likely to be involved in protein misfolding and aggregation.


CONCLUSIONS
amypdb is a comprehensive online database aiming at the centralization of bioinformatic data regarding all amyloid proteins and their precursors. our sequence pattern discovery and analysis approach unveiled protein regions of significant interest. amypdb is freely accessible  <cit> .
