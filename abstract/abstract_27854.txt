BACKGROUND
date palm has been a major fruit tree in the middle east over thousands of years, especially in the arabian peninsula. dates are consumed fresh  or after partial drying and storage  during off-season. the aim of the study was to provide in-depth analysis of fungal communities associated with the skin  and mesocarp  of stored dates  of two cultivars  through the use of illumina miseq sequencing.


RESULTS
the study revealed the dominance of ascomycota  in both cultivars, followed by chytridiomycota  and zygomycota . among the classes recovered, eurotiomycetes, dothideomycetes, saccharomycetes and sordariomycetes were the most dominant. a total of  <dig> fungal species were detected, with species belonging to penicillium, alternaria, cladosporium and aspergillus comprising more than 60% of the fungal reads. some potentially mycotoxin-producing fungi were detected in stored dates, including aspergillus flavus, a. versicolor and penicillium citrinum, but their relative abundance was very limited . permanova analysis revealed the presence of insignificant differences in fungal communities between date parts or date cultivars, indicating that fungal species associated with the skin may also be detected in the mesocarp. it also indicates the possible contamination of dates from different cultivars with similar fungal species, even though if they are obtained from different areas.


CONCLUSIONS
the analysis shows the presence of different fungal species in dates. this appears to be the first study to report  <dig> new fungal species in oman and  <dig> new fungal species from date fruits. the study discusses the sources of fungi on dates and the presence of potentially mycotoxin producing fungi on date skin and mesocarp.
