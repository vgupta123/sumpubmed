BACKGROUND
little is known concerning the prevalence of toxoplasma gondii infection in dogs in mexico. here, we investigated antibodies to t. gondii and associated risk factors in  <dig> dogs from an animal shelter in veracruz state, mexico. canine sera were assayed for t. gondii igg antibodies by using the modified agglutination test .


RESULTS
sixty eight  of  <dig> dogs were seropositive with titers of 1: <dig> in  <dig>  1: <dig> in  <dig>  1: <dig> in  <dig>  1: <dig> in  <dig>  1: <dig> in  <dig>  1: <dig> in  <dig>  1: <dig> in  <dig>  and 1: <dig> or higher in  <dig>  none of the dogsâ€™ characteristics studied including age, sex, breed, and history of deworming, rabies vaccination and contact with cats was associated with seroprevalence of t. gondii infection.


CONCLUSIONS
using the dogs as sentinel animals, the results indicate high contamination with t. gondii of the environment in veracruz, mexico. results have public health implications, and further studies in veracruz should be conducted to establish the sources of environmental contamination with t. gondii and to determine optimal preventive measures against t. gondii infection in humans.
