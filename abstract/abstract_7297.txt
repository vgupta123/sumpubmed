BACKGROUND
basic manufacturing principles are becoming increasingly important in high-throughput sequencing facilities where there is a constant drive to increase quality, increase efficiency, and decrease operating costs. while high-throughput centres report failure rates typically on the order of 10%, the causes of sporadic sequencing failures are seldom analyzed in detail and have not, in the past, been formally reported.


RESULTS
here we report the results of a failure mode analysis of our production sequencing facility based on detailed evaluation of  <dig>  ests generated from two cdna libraries. two categories of failures are described; process-related failures  and template-related failures .


CONCLUSIONS
preventative action based on a detailed understanding of failure modes is likely to improve the performance of other production sequencing pipelines.
