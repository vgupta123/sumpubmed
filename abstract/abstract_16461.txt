BACKGROUND
with the development of new technology, it has recently become practical to resequence the genome of a bacterium after experimental manipulation. it is critical though to know the accuracy of the technique used, and to establish confidence that all of the mutations were detected.


RESULTS
in order to evaluate the accuracy of genome resequencing using the microarray-based comparative genome sequencing service provided by nimblegen systems inc., we resequenced the e. coli strain w <dig> kohara using mg <dig> as a reference, both of which have been completely sequenced using traditional sequencing methods. cgs detected  <dig> of  <dig> small sequence differences, one large deletion, and  <dig> of  <dig> is element insertions present in w <dig>  but did not detect a large chromosomal inversion. in addition, we confirmed that cgs also detected  <dig> snps, one deletion and  <dig> is element insertions that are not present in the genome sequence, which we attribute to changes that occurred after the creation of the w <dig> lambda clone library. the false positive rate for snps was one per  <dig> kb of genome sequence.


CONCLUSIONS
cgs is an effective way to detect multiple mutations present in one bacterium relative to another, and while highly cost-effective, is prone to certain errors. mutations occurring in repeated sequences or in sequences with a high degree of secondary structure may go undetected. it is also critical to follow up on regions of interest in which snps were not called because they often indicate deletions or is element insertions.
