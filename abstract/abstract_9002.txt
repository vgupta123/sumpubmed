BACKGROUND
integrative conjugative elements  are important factors in the plasticity of microbial genomes. an element related to the ice tn <dig> was discovered during a bioinformatic search of the ralstonia pickettii 12j genome. this element was analysed and further searches carried out for additional elements.

a pcr method was designed to detect and characterise new elements of this type based on this scaffold and a culture collection of fifty-eight ralstonia pickettii and ralstonia insidiosa strains were analysed for the presence of the element.


RESULTS
comparative sequence analysis of bacterial genomes has revealed the presence of a number of uncharacterised tn4371-like ices in the genomes of several β and γ- proteobacteria. these elements vary in size, gc content, putative function and have a mosaic-like structure of plasmid- and phage-like sequences which is typical of tn4371-like ices. these elements were found after a through search of the genbank database. the elements, which are found in ralstonia, delftia, acidovorax, bordetella, comamonas, acidovorax, congregibacter, shewanella, pseudomonas stenotrophomonas, thioalkalivibrio sp. hl-ebgr <dig>  polaromonas, burkholderia and diaphorobacter sp. share a common scaffold. a pcr method was designed  to detect and characterise new elements of this type.


CONCLUSIONS
all elements found in this study possess a common scaffold of core genes but contain different accessory genes. a new uniform nomenclature is suggested for ices of the tn <dig> family. two novel tn4371-like ice were discovered and characterised, using the novel pcr method described in two different isolates of ralstonia pickettii from laboratory purified water.
