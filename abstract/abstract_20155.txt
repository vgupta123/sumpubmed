BACKGROUND
human tissue plasminogen activator  belongs to the serine protease family. it converts plasminogen into plasmin and is used clinically to treat thrombosis. human tpa is composed of  <dig> amino acids residues and contains  <dig> disulfide bonds. escherichia coli has been used only rarely for the efficient production of recombinant tpa. however, the functional expression of full-length tpa that contains multiple disulfide bonds on an industrial scale remains challenging. here, we describe the soluble expression and characterization of full-length tpa by auto-induction in e. coli.


RESULTS
we achieved optimal levels of gene expression, minimized negative effects related to the production of heterologous proteins, and optimized cytoplasmic yields. three different e. coli strains, bl <dig> , rosetta, and origami  <dig>  could express tpa using an auto-induction mechanism. in addition, similar yields of recombinant protein were produced at temperatures of  <dig>   <dig>  and 37°c. the e. coli strain origami  <dig> could increase disulfide bond formation in cytoplasmic tpa and produce purified soluble recombinant protein . the full-length tpa was monomeric in solution, and fibrin plate assays confirmed that the recombinant tpa displayed serine protease activity.


CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report that describes the heterologous expression of correctly folded active full-length tpa. this could provide valuable information for using prokaryotic auto-induction expression systems to produce tpa at industrial and pharmaceutical levels without in vitro refolding during the production step.
