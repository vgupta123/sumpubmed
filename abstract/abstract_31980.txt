BACKGROUND
roundabouts are axon guidance molecules that have recently been identified to play a role in vascular guidance as well. in this study, we have investigated gene knockdown analysis of endothelial robos, in particular roundabout  <dig> , the predominant robo in endothelial cells using small interfering rna technology in vitro.


RESULTS
robo <dig> and robo <dig> knockdown cells display distinct activity in endothelial cell migration assay. the knockdown of robo <dig> abrogated the chemotactic response of endothelial cells to serum but enhanced a chemokinetic response to slit <dig>  while robo <dig> knockdown cells do not display chemotactic response to serum or vegf. robo <dig> knockdown endothelial cells unexpectedly show up regulation of rho gtpases. zebrafish robo <dig> rescues both rho gtpase homeostasis and serum reduced chemotaxis in robo <dig> knockdown cells. robo <dig> and robo <dig> interact and share molecules such as slit <dig>  mena and vilse, a cdc42-gap. in addition, this study mechanistically implicates irsp <dig> in the signaling nexus between activated cdc <dig> and mena, both of which have previously been shown to be involved with robo <dig> signaling in endothelial cells.


CONCLUSIONS
this study identifies specific components of the robo signaling apparatus that work together to guide directional migration of endothelial cells.
