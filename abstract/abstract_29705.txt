BACKGROUND
mannose binding lectin  is an important host defence protein against opportunistic fungal pathogens. this carbohydrate-binding protein, an opsonin and lectin pathway activator, binds through multiple lectin domains to the repeating sugar arrays displayed on the surface of a wide range of clinically relevant microbial species. we investigated the contribution of mbl to antifungal innate immunity towards c. parapsilosis in vitro.


RESULTS
high avidity binding was observed between mbl and c. albicans and c. parapsilosis. addition of mbl to mbl deficient serum increased the deposition of c <dig> and c3b and enhanced the uptake of c. albicans, c. parapsilosis and acapsular c. neoformans by polymorphonuclear cells . compared to other microorganisms, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and cryptococcus neoformans, c. parapsilosis and candida albicans were potent activators of the lectin pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that mbl plays a crucial role in the innate immunity against infections caused by yeast by increasing uptake by pmn.
