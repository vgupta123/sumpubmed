BACKGROUND
comparative genomic hybridization  constitutes a powerful tool for identification and characterization of bacterial strains. in this study we have applied this technique for the characterization of a number of lactobacillus strains isolated from the intestinal content of rats fed with a diet supplemented with sorbitol.


RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene, reca, phes, pyrg and tuf sequences identified five bacterial strains isolated from the intestinal content of rats as belonging to the recently described lactobacillus taiwanensis species. dna-dna hybridization experiments confirmed that these five strains are distinct but closely related to lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus gasseri. a whole genome dna microarray designed for the probiotic l. johnsonii strain ncc <dig> was used for cgh analysis of l. johnsonii atcc 33200t, l. johnsonii bl <dig>  l. gasseri atcc 33323t and l. taiwanensis bl <dig>  in these experiments, the fluorescence ratio distributions obtained with l. taiwanensis and l. gasseri showed characteristic inter-species profiles. the percentage of conserved l. johnsonii ncc <dig> genes was about 83% in the l. johnsonii strains comparisons and decreased to 51% and 47% for l. taiwanensis and l. gasseri, respectively. these results confirmed the separate status of l. taiwanensis from l. johnsonii at the level of species, and also that l. taiwanensis is closer to l. johnsonii than l. gasseri is to l. johnsonii.


CONCLUSIONS
conventional taxonomic analyses and microarray-based cgh analysis have been used for the identification and characterization of the newly species l. taiwanensis. the microarray-based cgh technology has been shown as a remarkable tool for the identification and fine discrimination between phylogenetically close species, and additionally provided insight into the adaptation of the strain l. taiwanensis bl <dig> to its ecological niche.
