BACKGROUND
a giant protein called bap  plays a role in biofilm formation and adhesion to host cells in a. baumannii. most of the protein is made by arrays of 80– <dig> aa modules featuring immunoglobulin-like  motifs.


RESULTS
the survey of  <dig> a. baumannii sequenced strains belonging to  <dig> sts  revealed that bap is highly polymorphic, distinguishable in three main types for changes both in the repetitive and the cooh region. analyzing the different sts, we found that 29 % feature type- <dig>  40 % type- <dig> bap, 11 % type- <dig> bap, 20 % lack bap. the type- <dig> variant is restricted to a. baumannii, type- <dig> and type- <dig> bap have been identified also in other species of the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii  complex. a. calcoaceticus and a. pittii also encode bap-like proteins in which ig-like repeats are replaced by long tracts of alternating serine and aspartic acid residues. we have identified in species of the acb complex two additional proteins, blp <dig> and blp <dig>  which feature ig-like repeats, share with bap a sequence motif at the nh <dig> terminus, and are similarly expressed in stationary growth phase. the knock-out of either blp <dig> or blp <dig> genes of the a. baumannii st <dig> aye strain severely affected biofilm formation, as measured by comparing biofilm biomass and thickness, and adherence to epithelial cells. blp <dig> is missing in the majority of type- <dig> bap strains. blp <dig> is largely conserved, but is frequently missing in bap-negative cells.


CONCLUSIONS
multiple proteins sharing ig-like repeats seem to be involved in biofilm formation. the uneven distribution of the different bap types, blp <dig>  and blp <dig> is highly indicative that alternative protein complexes involved in biofilm formation are assembled in different a. baumannii strains.
