BACKGROUND
the common marmoset monkey , a small non-endangered new world primate native to eastern brazil, is becoming increasingly used as a non-human primate model in biomedical research, drug development and safety assessment. in contrast to the growing interest for the marmoset as an animal model, the molecular tools for genetic analysis are extremely limited.


RESULTS
here we report the development of the first marmoset-specific oligonucleotide microarray  containing probe sets targeting  <dig> different marmoset transcripts expressed in hippocampus. these  <dig> transcripts represent a wide variety of different functional gene classes. hybridisation of the marmoset microarray with labelled rna from hippocampus, cortex and a panel of  <dig> different peripheral tissues resulted in high detection rates of 85% in the neuronal tissues and on average 70% in the non-neuronal tissues. the expression profiles of the  <dig> neuronal tissues, hippocampus and cortex, were highly similar, as indicated by a correlation coefficient of  <dig> . several transcripts with a tissue-specific pattern of expression were identified. besides the marmoset microarray we have generated  <dig> ests derived from marmoset hippocampus, which have been annotated and submitted to genbank .


CONCLUSIONS
we have generated the first marmoset-specific dna microarray and demonstrated its use to characterise large-scale gene expression profiles of hippocampus but also of other neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. in addition, we have generated a large collection of ests of marmoset origin, which are now available in the public domain. these new tools will facilitate molecular genetic research into this non-human primate animal model.
