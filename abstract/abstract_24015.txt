BACKGROUND
cryptochromes  are a class of flavoprotein blue-light signaling receptors found in plants and animals, and they control plant development and the entrainment of circadian rhythms. they also act as integral parts of the central circadian oscillator in humans and other animals. in mammals, the clock-bmal <dig> heterodimer activates transcription of the per and cry genes as well as clock-regulated genes. the per <dig> proteins interact with cry and ckiÎµ, and the resulting ternary complexes translocate into the nucleus, where they negatively regulate the transcription of per and cry core clock genes and other clock-regulated output genes. recent studies have indicated that the extended c-termini of the mammalian crys, as compared to photolyase proteins, interact with per proteins.


RESULTS
we identified a region on mcry <dig>  responsible for direct physical interaction with mper <dig> by mammalian two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays. moreover, using oligonucleotide-based degenerate pcr, we discovered that mutation of arg- <dig> and lys- <dig> of mcry <dig> within this c-terminal region totally abolishes interaction with per <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results identify mcry <dig> amino acid residues that interact with the mper <dig> binding region and suggest the potential for rational drug design to inhibit crys for specific therapeutic approaches.
