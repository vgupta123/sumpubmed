BACKGROUND
bacterial infections have been linked to malignancies due to their ability to induce chronic inflammation. we investigated the association of oral bacteria in oral squamous cell carcinoma  tissues and compared with adjacent non-tumor mucosa sampled  <dig> cm distant from the same patient . by using culture-independent 16s rrna approaches, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis  and cloning and sequencing, we assessed the total bacterial diversity in these clinical samples.


RESULTS
dgge fingerprints showed variations in the band intensity profiles within non-tumor and tumor tissues of the same patient and among the two groups. the clonal analysis indicated that from a total of  <dig> sequences characterized,  <dig> bacterial species/phylotypes were detected representing six phyla, firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria, fusobacteria, actinobacteria and uncultivated tm <dig> in non-tumor and tumor libraries. in combined library,  <dig> classes,  <dig> order,  <dig> families and  <dig> genera were observed. bacterial species, streptococcus sp. oral taxon  <dig>  peptostreptococcus stomatis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorum, johnsonella ignava and streptococcus parasanguinis i were highly associated with tumor site where as granulicatella adiacens was prevalent at non-tumor site. streptococcus intermedius was present in 70% of both non-tumor and tumor sites.


CONCLUSIONS
the underlying changes in the bacterial diversity in the oral mucosal tissues from non-tumor and tumor sites of oscc subjects indicated a shift in bacterial colonization. these most prevalent or unique bacterial species/phylotypes present in tumor tissues may be associated with oscc and needs to be further investigated with a larger sample size.
