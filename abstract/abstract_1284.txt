BACKGROUND
livestock that consume locoweed exhibit multiple neurological symptoms, including dispirited behavior, staggered gait, trembling, ataxia, impaired reproductive function and cellular vacuolar degeneration of multiple tissues due to toxicity from plant-derived alkaloids such as swainsonine.


RESULTS
swainsonine was administered to f <dig> and f <dig> mice by intraperitoneal injection before, during and after pregnancy at the following doses:  <dig>  mg/kg bw,  <dig>  mg/kg bw,  <dig>  mg/kg bw and 0 mg/kg bw. hemosiderin deposits were observed the lamina propria of endometrium in uterus and the red pulp of spleen. ovary corpus lutea counts in f <dig> mice were higher in swainsonine-treated mice compared to control mice. indirect bilirubin content and reticulocyte numbers were increased in swainsonine-treated f <dig> and f <dig> generation mice compared to control group . lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase content in f0-i and f0-ii mice were significantly increased compared with f0-iv group mice . red blood cells, hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin levels were significantly decreased in f <dig> and f <dig> mice compared with the control group .


CONCLUSIONS
swainsonine exerts effects on estrus period and reproductive ability, and offspring of dams dosed with swainsonine were affected in-utero or from nursing. damage to liver, uterus and spleen, as well as hematological changes, are observable before neurological symptoms present.
