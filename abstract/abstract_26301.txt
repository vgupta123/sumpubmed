BACKGROUND
the notion that genes are non-randomly organized within the chromosomes of eukaryotic organisms has recently received strong experimental support. clusters of co-expressed and co-localized genes have been recognized as playing key roles in a number of functional pathways and adaptive responses including organism development, differentiation, disease states and aging. the identification of genes arranged in close proximity with each other within a particular temporal and spatial transcriptional program is anticipated to unravel possible functional links and reciprocal interactions.


RESULTS
we developed a novel software tool gepoclu  that automatically selects genes based on expression values from multiple sources, including microarray, est and qrt-pcr, and performs positional clustering. gepoclu provides expression-based gene selection from multiple experimental sources, position-based gene clustering and cluster visualization functionalities, all as parts of the same fully integrated, and interactive, package. this means rapid iterations while exploring for emergent behavior, and full programmability of the filtering and clustering steps.


CONCLUSIONS
gepoclu is a useful data-mining tool for exploring relationships among transcriptional data deriving form different sources. it provides an easy interactive environment for analyzing positional clustering behavior of co-expressed genes, and at the same time it is fully programmable, so that it can be customized and extended to support specific analysis needs.
