BACKGROUND
laribacter hongkongensis is a gram-negative, urease-positive bacillus associated with invasive bacteremic infections in liver cirrhosis patients and fish-borne community-acquired gastroenteritis and traveler’s diarrhea. its mechanisms of adaptation to various environmental niches and host defense evasion are largely unknown. during the process of analyzing the l. hongkongensis genome, a complete urease cassette and two adjacent arc gene cassettes were found. we hypothesize that the urease cassette and/or the arc gene cassettes are important for l. hongkongensis to survive in acidic environment and macrophages. in this study, we tested this hypothesis by constructing single, double and triple non-polar deletion mutants of the urease and two arc gene cassettes of l. hongkongensis using the conjugation-mediated gene deletion system and examining their effects in acidic environment in vitro, in macrophages and in a mouse model.


RESULTS
hlhk9∆urea, hlhk9∆urec, hlhk9∆ured and hlhk9∆uree all exhibited no urease activity. hlhk9∆arca <dig> and hlhk9∆arca <dig> both exhibited arginine deiminase  activities, but hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig> double deletion mutant exhibited no adi activity. at ph  <dig> and  <dig>  survival of hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig> and hlhk9∆urea/arca1/arca <dig> were markedly decreased  but that of hlhk9∆urea was slightly decreased , compared to wild type l. hongkongensis hlhk <dig>  survival of hlhk9∆urea/arca1/arca <dig> and hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig> in macrophages were also markedly decreased  but that of hlhk9∆urea was slightly decreased , compared to hlhk <dig>  although expression of arca <dig>  arca <dig> and urea genes were all upregulated. using a mouse model, hlhk9∆urea exhibited similar survival compared to hlhk <dig> after passing through the murine stomach, but survival of hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig> and hlhk9∆urea/arca1/arca <dig> were markedly reduced .


CONCLUSIONS
in contrast to other important gastrointestinal tract pathogens, adi pathway is far more important than urease for acid resistance and intracellular survival in l. hongkongensis. the gene duplication of the arc gene cassettes could be a result of their functional importance in l. hongkongensis.
