BACKGROUND
various h-serotypes of the shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli  o <dig>  including h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  and h¯, have been associated with sporadic cases of illness and have caused food-borne outbreaks globally. in the u.s., stec o104:h <dig> caused an outbreak associated with milk in  <dig>  however, there is little known on the evolutionary origins of stec o <dig> strains, and how genotypic diversity contributes to pathogenic potential of various o <dig> h-antigen serotypes isolated from different ecological niches and/or geographical regions.


RESULTS
two stec o104:h <dig>  and o104:h <dig>  strains were shot-gun sequenced, and the genomes were closed. the intimin  gene, involved in the attaching-effacing phenotype of diarrheagenic e. coli, was not found in either strain. examining various o <dig> genome sequences, we found that two “complete” left and right end portions of the locus of enterocyte effacement  pathogenicity island were present in  <dig> o <dig> strains; however, the central portion of lee was missing, where the eae gene is located. in o104:h <dig> strains, the missing central portion of the lee locus was replaced by a pathogenicity island carrying the aida  gene and antibiotic resistance genes commonly carried on plasmids. enteroaggregative e. coli-specific virulence genes and european outbreak o104:h4-specific stx2-encoding escherichia p <dig> or escherichia tl-2011c bacteriophages were missing in some of the o104:h <dig> genome sequences available from public databases. most of the genomic variations in the strains examined were due to the presence of different mobile genetic elements, including prophages and genomic island regions. the presence of plasmids carrying virulence-associated genes may play a role in the pathogenic potential of o <dig> strains.


CONCLUSIONS
the two strains sequenced in this study  are genetically more similar to each other than to the o104:h <dig> strains that caused an outbreak in germany in  <dig> and strains found in central africa. a hypothesis on strain evolution and pathogenic potential of various h-serotypes of e. coli o <dig> strains is proposed.
