BACKGROUND
deer mice  are the most common mammals in north america and are reservoirs for several zoonotic agents, including sin nombre virus , the principal etiologic agent of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome  in north america. unlike human hcps patients, snv-infected deer mice show no overt pathological symptoms, despite the presence of virus in the lungs. a neutralizing igg antibody response occurs, but the virus establishes a persistent infection. limitations of detailed analysis of deer mouse immune responses to snv are the lack of reagents and methods for evaluating such responses.


RESULTS
we developed real-time pcr-based detection assays for several immune-related transcription factor and cytokine genes from deer mice that permit the profiling of cd4+ helper t cells, including markers of th <dig> cells , th <dig> cells  and regulatory t cells . these assays compare the expression of in vitro antigen-stimulated and unstimulated t cells from individual deer mice.


CONCLUSIONS
we developed molecular methods for profiling immune gene expression in deer mice, including a multiplexed real-time pcr assay for assessing expression of several cytokine and transcription factor genes. these assays should be useful for characterizing the immune responses of experimentally- and naturally-infected deer mice.
