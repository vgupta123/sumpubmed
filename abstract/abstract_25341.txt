BACKGROUND
surface proteins are a key to a deeper understanding of the behaviour of gram-positive bacteria interacting with the human gastro-intestinal tract. such proteins contribute to cell wall synthesis and maintenance and are important for interactions between the bacterial cell and the human host. since they are exposed and may play roles in pathogenicity, surface proteins are interesting targets for drug design.


RESULTS
using methods based on proteolytic "shaving" of bacterial cells and subsequent mass spectrometry-based protein identification, we have identified surface-located proteins in enterococcus faecalis v <dig>  in total  <dig> unique proteins were identified, few of which have been identified and characterized previously.  <dig> of these proteins are predicted to be cytoplasmic, whereas the other  <dig> are predicted to have surface locations  or to be secreted . lipid-anchored proteins were the most dominant among the identified surface proteins. the seemingly most abundant surface proteins included a membrane protein with a potentially shedded extracellular sulfatase domain that could act on the sulfate groups in mucin and a lipid-anchored fumarate reductase that could contribute to generation of reactive oxygen species.


CONCLUSIONS
the present proteome analysis gives an experimental impression of the protein landscape on the cell surface of the pathogenic bacterium e. faecalis. the  <dig> identified secreted  and surface  proteins included several proteins involved in cell wall synthesis, pheromone-regulated processes, and transport of solutes, as well as proteins with unknown function. these proteins stand out as interesting targets for further investigation of the interaction between e. faecalis and its environment.
