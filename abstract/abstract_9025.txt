BACKGROUND
in recent years advances have been made in the investigative methods of molecular background of canine heart disease. studies have been conducted to identify specific genes which, when pathologically expressed, could lead to the dysfunction of the canine heart or are correlated with heart failure. for this purpose genome wide microarray experiments on tissues from failing hearts have been performed. in the presented study a whole genome microarray analysis was used for the first time to describe the transcription profile of peripheral blood nuclear cells in dogs with heart failure. dogs with recognized heart disease were classified according the isachc  classification scheme as class  <dig>  -  <dig> dogs, class  <dig>  -  <dig> dogs and class  <dig>  -  <dig> dogs. the control group consisted of  <dig> healthy dogs. the clinical picture of the animals included: animal history, clinical examination, echocardiographic examination and where applicable electrocardiographic and radiographic examinations.


RESULTS
in the present study we identified four sets of differentially expressed genes, namely heart-failure-specific genes and isachc1-specific genes, isachc2-sepcific genes and isachc- <dig> specific genes. the most important set consisted of genes differentially expressed in all dogs with heart failure, despite the isachc stage. we identified  <dig> heart-failure-specific genes which were involved in two statistically significant receptor signalling pathways, namely angiotensinr - > creb/elk-srf/tp <dig> signalling and ephrinr - > actin signalling. the number of isachc1-specific genes was 83; isachc2-specific genes -  <dig> and isachc3-specific -  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptomic profile of peripheral blood nuclear cells in dogs with heart failure seems to reflect the presence of clinical signs of the disease in patients based on the observation that the largest number of differentially expressed genes was identified in isachc  <dig> group of patients. this group consists of dogs just starting to show clinical signs of heart failure. a set of genes was also found to have changed expression in all dogs with heart failure, despite the stage of the disease.
