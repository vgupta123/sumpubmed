BACKGROUND
accurate identification of synteny blocks is an important step in comparative genomics towards the understanding of genome architecture and expression. most computer programs developed in the last decade for identifying synteny blocks have limitations. to address these limitations, we recently developed a robust program called orthocluster, and an online database orthoclusterdb. in this work, we have demonstrated the application of orthocluster in identifying synteny blocks between the genomes of caenorhabditis elegans and caenorhabditis briggsae, two closely related hermaphrodite nematodes.


RESULTS
initial identification and analysis of synteny blocks using orthocluster enabled us to systematically improve the genome annotation of c. elegans and c. briggsae, identifying  <dig> potential novel genes in c. elegans,  <dig> in c. briggsae, and  <dig> novel orthologous relationships between these two species. using the improved annotation, we have detected  <dig>  perfect synteny blocks that contain no mismatches between c. elegans and c. briggsae. among these synteny blocks, the majority are mapped to homologous chromosomes, as previously reported. the largest perfect synteny block contains  <dig> genes, which spans  <dig>  kb in chromosome v of c. elegans. on average, perfect synteny blocks span  <dig>  kb in length. when some mismatches  are allowed, synteny blocks  that are much larger in size are identified. we have shown that the majority  of the c. elegans and c. briggsae genomes are covered by imperfect synteny blocks. the largest imperfect synteny block spans  <dig>  mb in chromosome x of c. elegans and there are  <dig> synteny blocks that are larger than  <dig> mb in size. on average, imperfect synteny blocks span  <dig>  kb in length, larger than previously reported.


CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that orthocluster can be used to accurately identify synteny blocks and have found that synteny blocks between c. elegans and c. briggsae are almost three-folds larger than previously identified.
