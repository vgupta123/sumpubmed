BACKGROUND
mokola virus  is a rabies-related lyssavirus and appears to be exclusive to the african continent. only  <dig> cases of mokv, which includes two human cases, have been reported since its identification in  <dig>  mokv has an unknown reservoir host and current commercial vaccines do not confer protection against mokv.


RESULTS
we describe three new isolations of mokv from domestic cats in south africa. two cases were retrospectively identified from  <dig> and an additional one in  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these cases emphasize the generally poor surveillance for rabies-related lyssaviruses and our inadequate comprehension of the epidemiology and ecology of mokola lyssavirus per se.
