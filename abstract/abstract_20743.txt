BACKGROUND
ovarian folliculogenesis in mammals is a complex process involving interactions between germ and somatic cells. carefully orchestrated expression of transcription factors, cell adhesion molecules and growth factors are required for success. we have identified a germ-cell specific, basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, figla  and demonstrated its involvement in two independent developmental processes: formation of the primordial follicle and coordinate expression of zona pellucida genes.


RESULTS
taking advantage of figla null mouse lines, we have used a combined approach of microarray and serial analysis of gene expression  to identify potential downstream target genes. using high stringent cutoffs, we find that figla functions as a key regulatory molecule in coordinating expression of the nalp family of genes, genes of known oocyte-specific expression and a set of functionally un-annotated genes. figla also inhibits expression of male germ cell specific genes that might otherwise disrupt normal oogenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
these data implicate figla as a central regulator of oocyte-specific genes that play roles in folliculogenesis, fertilization and early development.
