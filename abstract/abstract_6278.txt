BACKGROUND
triple negative breast cancer  in humans is defined by the absence of oestrogen receptor , progesterone receptor  and her <dig> overexpression. mammalian target of rapamycin  is overexpressed in tnbc and it represents a potential target for the treatment of this aggressive tumour. feline mammary carcinoma  is considered to be a model for hormone-independent human breast cancer. this study investigated mtor and p-mtor expression in fmc in relation to triple negative  phenotype.


RESULTS
the expression of mtor, p-mtor, erÎ±, pr and her <dig> was evaluated in  <dig> fmcs by immunohistochemistry and in six fmc cell lines by western blot analysis.  <dig> % of fmc analyzed were er, pr, her <dig> negative  while  <dig> % and  <dig> % of cases expressed mtor and p-mtor respectively. in this study we found that m-tor and p-mtor were more frequently detected in tn-fmc and in her <dig> negative samples.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we demonstrate that there is also a fmc subset defined as tn fmc, which is characterised by a statistically significant association with m-tor and p-mtor expression as demonstrated in human breast cancer.
