BACKGROUND
two evolutionarily conserved sequence elements, cse <dig> and cse <dig> , are found within the  <dig> -kb cpg island surrounding the bidirectional promoter of two imprinted genes, peg <dig>  and usp <dig> . this cpg island is a likely icr  that controls transcription of the 500-kb genomic region of the peg <dig> imprinted domain.


RESULTS
the current study investigated the functional roles of cse <dig> and cse <dig> in the transcriptional control of the two genes, peg <dig> and usp <dig>  using cell line-based promoter assays. the mutation of  <dig> yy <dig> binding sites  reduced the transcriptional activity of the bidirectional promoter in the peg <dig> direction in an orientation-dependent manner, suggesting an activator role for cse <dig> . however, the activity in the usp <dig> direction was not detectable regardless of the presence/absence of yy <dig> binding sites. in contrast, mutation of cse <dig> increased the transcriptional activity of the promoter in both the peg <dig> and usp <dig> directions, suggesting a potential repressor role for cse <dig>  the observed repression by cse <dig> was also orientation-dependent. serial mutational analyses further narrowed down two separate 6-bp-long regions within the 42-bp-long cse <dig> which are individually responsible for the repression of peg <dig> and usp <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
cse <dig>  functions as an activator for peg <dig> transcription, while cse <dig> acts as a repressor for the transcription of both peg <dig> and usp <dig>
