BACKGROUND
the horizontal transfer of expressed genes from bacteria into ciliates which live in close contact with each other in the rumen  was studied using ciliate expressed sequence tags . more than  <dig> ests were sequenced from representatives of the two major groups of rumen cilates: the order entodiniomorphida  and the order vestibuliferida, previously called holotricha .


RESULTS
a comparison of the sequences with the completely sequenced genomes of eukaryotes and prokaryotes, followed by large-scale construction and analysis of phylogenies, identified  <dig> ciliate genes that specifically cluster with genes from the bacteria and archaea. the phylogenetic clustering with bacterial genes, coupled with the absence of close relatives of these genes in the ciliate tetrahymena thermophila, indicates that they have been acquired via horizontal gene transfer  after the colonization of the gut by the rumen ciliates.


CONCLUSIONS
among the hgt candidates, we found an over-representation  of genes involved in metabolism, specifically in the catabolism of complex carbohydrates, a rich food source in the rumen. we propose that the acquisition of these genes has greatly facilitated the ciliates' colonization of the rumen providing evidence for the role of hgt in the adaptation to new niches.
