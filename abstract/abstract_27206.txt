BACKGROUND
despite vaccination since the 1950s, pertussis has persisted and resurged. it remains a major cause of infant death worldwide and is the most prevalent vaccine-preventable disease in developed countries. the resurgence of pertussis has been associated with the expansion of bordetella pertussis strains with a novel allele for the pertussis toxin  promoter, ptxp <dig>  which have replaced resident ptxp <dig> strains. compared to ptxp <dig> strains, ptxp <dig> produce more ptx resulting in increased virulence and immune suppression. to elucidate how b. pertussis has adapted to vaccination, we compared genome sequences of two ptxp <dig> strains with four strains isolated before and after the introduction vaccination.


RESULTS
the distribution of snps in regions involved in transcription and translation suggested that changes in gene regulation play an important role in adaptation. no evidence was found for acquisition of novel genes. modern strains differed significantly from prevaccination strains, both phylogenetically and with respect to particular alleles. the ptxp <dig> strains were found to have diverged recently from modern ptxp <dig> strains. differences between ptxp <dig> and modern ptxp <dig> strains included snps in a number of pathogenicity-associated genes. further, both gene inactivation and reactivation was observed in ptxp <dig> strains relative to modern ptxp <dig> strains.


CONCLUSIONS
our work suggests that b. pertussis adapted by successive accumulation of snps and by gene activation. in particular changes in gene regulation may have played a role in adaptation.
