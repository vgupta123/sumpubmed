BACKGROUND
eph kinases are the largest family of cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases. the ligands of ephs, ephrins , are also cell surface molecules. ephs interact with efns transmitting signals in both directions, i.e., from ephs to efns and from efns to ephs. efnb <dig> is known to be able to co-stimulate t cells in vitro and to modulate thymocyte development in a model of foetal thymus organ culture. to further understand the role of efnb <dig> in t cell immunity, we generated t-cell-specific efnb <dig> gene knockout mice to assess t cell development and function in these mice.


RESULTS
the mice were of normal size and cellularity in the thymus and spleen and had normal t cell subpopulations in these organs. the bone marrow progenitors from ko mice and wt control mice repopulated host spleen t cell pool to similar extents. the activation and proliferation of ko t cells was comparable to that of control mice. na√Øve ko cd <dig> cells showed an ability to differentiate into th <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig> and treg cells similar to control cd <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that the function of efnb <dig> in the t cell compartment could be compensated by other members of the efn family, and that such redundancy safeguards the pivotal roles of efnb <dig> in t cell development and function.
