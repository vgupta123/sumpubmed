BACKGROUND
free-ranging narwhals  were instrumented in admiralty inlet, canada with both satellite tags to study migration and stock separation and short-term, high-resolution digital archival tags to explore diving and feeding behaviour. three narwhals were equipped with an underwater camera pod , another individual was equipped with a digital archival tag , and a fifth with both units during august  <dig> and  <dig> 


RESULTS
crittercam footage indicated that of the combined  <dig> minutes of recordings, 12% of the time was spent along the bottom. when the bottom was visible in the camera footage, the narwhals were oriented upside-down 80% of the time . the dtag data  revealed that during time spent below the surface, the two tagged narwhals were supine an average of 13%  of the time. roughly 70% of this time spent in a supine posture occurred during the descent.


CONCLUSIONS
possible reasons for this upside-down swimming behaviour are discussed. no preference for a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction of roll was observed, discounting the possibility that rolling movements contribute to the asymmetric left-handed helical turns of the tusk.
