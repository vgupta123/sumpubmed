BACKGROUND
low-temperature growth and fermentation of wine yeast can enhance wine aroma and make them highly desirable traits for the industry. elucidating response to cold in saccharomyces cerevisiae is, therefore, of paramount importance to select or genetically improve new wine strains. as most enological traits of industrial importance in yeasts, adaptation to low temperature is a polygenic trait regulated by many interacting loci.


RESULTS
in order to unravel the genetic determinants of low-temperature fermentation, we mapped quantitative trait loci  by bulk segregant analyses in the f <dig> offspring of two saccharomyces cerevisiae industrial strains with divergent performance at low temperature. we detected four genomic regions involved in the adaptation at low temperature, three of them located in the subtelomeric regions  and one in the chromosome xiv. the qtl analysis revealed that subtelomeric regions play a key role in defining individual variation, which emphasizes the importance of these regions’ adaptive nature.


CONCLUSIONS
the reciprocal hemizygosity analysis , run to validate the genes involved in low-temperature fermentation, showed that genetic variation in mitochondrial proteins, maintenance of correct asymmetry and distribution of phospholipid in the plasma membrane are key determinants of low-temperature adaptation.
