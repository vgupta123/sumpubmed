BACKGROUND
polyploidy is an important evolutionary mechanism in flowering plants that often induces immediate extensive changes in gene expression through genomic merging and doubling. brassica napus l. is one of the most economically important polyploid oil crops and has been broadly studied as an example of polyploid crop. rna-seq is a recently developed technique for transcriptome study, which could be in choice for profiling gene expression pattern in polyploids.


RESULTS
we examined the global gene expression patterns of the first four generations of resynthesized b. napus , its diploid progenitors b. rapa and b. oleracea, and natural b. napus using digital gene expression analysis. almost  <dig> million clean tags were generated using illumina technology to produce the expression data for  <dig> genes, which account for 63% of the annotated b. rapa genome. more than 56% of the genes were transcribed from both strands, which indicate the importance of rna-mediated gene regulation in polyploidization. tag mapping of the b. rapa genome generated  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> annotated genes for the b. rapa, b. oleracea, f1–f <dig> of synthesized b. napus, and natural b. napus libraries, respectively. the unambiguous tag-mapped genes in the libraries were functionally categorized via gene ontological analysis. thousands of differentially expressed genes  were identified and revealed the substantial changes in f1–f <dig>  among the  <dig> most degs are dna binding/transcription factor, cyclin-dependent protein kinase, epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, and glycine-rich protein. the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  analysis of the degs suggested approximately  <dig> biological pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
the systematic deep sequencing analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of the transcriptome complexity of early generations of synthesized b. napus. this information broadens our understanding of the mechanisms of b. napus polyploidization and contributes to molecular and genetic research by enriching the brassica database.
