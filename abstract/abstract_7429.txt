BACKGROUND
atlantic cod  is a species with increasing economic significance for the aquaculture industry. the genetic improvement of cod will play a critical role in achieving successful large-scale aquaculture. while many microsatellite markers have been developed in cod, the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms  is currently limited. here we report the identification of snps from sequence data generated by a large-scale expressed sequence tag  program, focusing on fish originating from canadian waters.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> ests were assembled to generate  <dig> contigs. we detected  <dig> snps that met our selection criteria .  <dig> snps were selected for testing. the percentage of successful assays was 75%, with  <dig> snps amplifying correctly. of these,  <dig>  snps were monomorphic for all populations tested. in total,  <dig>  of snps are likely to represent duplicated genes or highly similar members of gene families, rather than alternative alleles of the same gene, since they showed a high frequency of heterozygosity. the remaining polymorphic snps  were categorised as validated snps. the mean minor allele frequency of the validated loci was  <dig>  . of the  <dig> contigs from which validated snps were selected, 31% have a significant blast hit. for the snps predicted to occur in coding regions , we determined that 36%  are non-synonymous. many loci  are polymorphic in all populations tested. however a small number of snps  that are polymorphic in the western atlantic were monomorphic in fish tested from three european populations. a preliminary linkage map has been constructed with  <dig> major linkage groups and  <dig> mapped snps.


CONCLUSIONS
these snps represent powerful tools to accelerate the genetic improvement of cod aquaculture. they have been used to build a genetic linkage map that can be applied to quantitative trait locus  discovery. since these snps were generated from ests, they are linked to specific genes. genes that map within qtl intervals can be prioritized for testing to determine whether they contribute to observed phenotypes.
