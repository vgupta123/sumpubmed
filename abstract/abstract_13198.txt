BACKGROUND
toceranib phosphate  has a reported objective response rate of 25% in both canine apocrine gland anal sac adenocarcinoma  and thyroid carcinoma , with stable disease occurring in an additional 50-60% of dogs. the basis for the observed responses to toceranib is not known. the purpose of this study was to evaluate agasaca and tc samples for the expression and activation of vegfr <dig>  pdgfrα, pdgfrβ, kit and ret to assess whether dysregulation of these receptor tyrosine kinases  may contribute to the biologic activity of toceranib.


RESULTS
mrna for vegfr <dig>  pdgfrα/β, kit and ret was detected in all agasaca samples. mrna for vegfr <dig>  pdgfrα/β, and kit was detected in all tc samples, while mrna for ret was amplified in 10/ <dig> samples. no phosphorylation of vegfr <dig>  pdgfrα/β, or kit was observed on the arrays. however, phosphorylation of ret was detected in 54% of the primary agasaca and 20% of tc. vegfr <dig> was expressed in 19/ <dig> primary and 6/ <dig> metastatic agasaca and 6/ <dig> tc samples. kit was present in 8/ <dig> primary and 3/ <dig> metastatic agasaca and 9/ <dig> tc samples. pdgfrα expression was noted in all tumor samples. in contrast pdgfrβ expression was found in only a few tumor samples but was evident in the stroma of all tumor specimens.


CONCLUSIONS
known targets of toceranib are expressed in both agasac and tc. given the observed expression of vegfr and pdgfrα/β and phosphorylation of ret, these rtks merit investigation as to their roles in the biology of agsaca and tc and their contribution to toceranib’s activity.
