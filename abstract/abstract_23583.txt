BACKGROUND
there is recently great interest in haplotype block structure and haplotype tagging snps  in the human genome for its implication on htsnps-based association mapping strategy for complex disease. different definitions have been used to characterize the haplotype block structure in the human genome, and several different performance criteria and algorithms have been suggested on htsnps selection.


RESULTS
a heuristic algorithm, generalized branch-and-bound algorithm, is applied to the searching of minimal set of haplotype tagging snps  according to different htsnps performance criteria. we develop a software htsnper <dig>  to implement the algorithm, and integrate three htsnps performance criteria and four haplotype block definitions for haplotype block partitioning. it is a software with powerful graphical user interface , which can be used to characterize the haplotype block structure and select htsnps in the candidate gene or interested genomic regions. it can find the global optimization with only a fraction of the computing time consumed by exhaustive searching algorithm.


CONCLUSIONS
htsnper <dig>  allows molecular geneticists to perform haplotype block analysis and htsnps selection using different definitions and performance criteria. the software is a powerful tool for those focusing on association mapping based on strategy of haplotype block and htsnps.
