BACKGROUND
activation of fatty acids by acyl-coa synthetase enzymes is required for de novo lipid synthesis, fatty acid catabolism, and remodeling of biological membranes. human long-chain acyl-coa synthetase member  <dig>  ascl <dig>  is a form present in the plasma membrane of cells. splicing events affecting the amino-terminus and alternative motifs near the atp-binding site generate different isoforms of acsl <dig> 


RESULTS
isoforms with different fatty acid gate-domain motifs have different activity and the form lacking this domain, isoform  <dig>  showed no detectable activity. enzymes truncated of the first  <dig> residues generate acyl-coas at a faster rate than the full-length protein. the gating residue, which prevents entry of the fatty acid substrate unless one molecule of atp has already accessed the catalytic site, was identified as a tyrosine for isoform  <dig> and a phenylalanine for isoform  <dig> at position  <dig>  all isoforms, with or without a fatty acid gate-domain, as well as recombinant protein truncated of the n-terminus, can interact to form enzymatic complexes with identical or different isoforms.


CONCLUSIONS
the alternative fatty acid gate-domain motifs are essential determinants for the activity of the human acsl <dig> isoforms, which appear to act as homodimeric enzyme as well as in complex with other spliced forms. these findings provide evidence that the diversity of these enzyme species could produce the variety of acyl-coa synthetase activities that are necessary to generate and repair the hundreds of lipid species present in membranes.
