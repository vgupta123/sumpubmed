BACKGROUND
fluctuating asymmetry , defined as small random deviations from the ideal bilateral symmetry, has been hypothesized to increase in response to both genetic and environmental stress experienced by a population. we compared levels of fa in  <dig> bilateral meristic traits , and heterozygosity in  <dig> microsatellite loci, among four marine  and four pond  populations of nine-spined sticklebacks .


RESULTS
pond sticklebacks had on average three times higher levels of fa than marine fish and this difference was highly significant. heterozygosity in microsatellite markers was on average two times lower in pond  than in marine  populations, and levels of fa and heterozygosity were negatively correlated across populations. however, after controlling for habitat effect on heterozygosity, levels of fa and heterozygosity were uncorrelated.


CONCLUSIONS
the fact that levels of fa in traits likely to be important in the context of predator evasion were elevated in ponds compared to marine populations suggests that relaxed selection for homeostasis in ponds lacking predatory fish may be responsible for the observed habitat difference in levels of fa. this inference also aligns with the observation that the levels of genetic variability across the populations did not explain population differences in levels of fa after correcting for habitat effect. hence, while differences in strength of selection, rather than in the degree of genetic stress could be argued to explain habitat differences in levels of fa, the hypothesis that increased fa in ponds is caused by genetic stress cannot be rejected.
