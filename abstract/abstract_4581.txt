BACKGROUND
mutations in the shaker-like voltage-gated potassium channel kv <dig>  are known to cause episodic ataxia type  <dig> and temporal lobe epilepsy. mice that express a malfunctional, truncated kv <dig>   show a markedly enlarged hippocampus and ventral cortex in adulthood.


RESULTS
to determine if mice lacking kv <dig>  also develop a brain enlargement similar to mceph/mceph, we transferred kv <dig>  null alleles to the balb/cbyj background. hippocampus and ventral cortex was then studied using in vivo 3d-magnetic resonance imaging and volume segmentation in adult kv <dig>  null mice, balb/cbyj-kv <dig> mceph/mceph, balb/cbyj-kv <dig> mceph/+, balb.c3heb -kv <dig> -/+ and wild type littermates. the kv <dig>  null brains had dramatically enlarged hippocampus and ventral cortex. mice heterozygous for either the null allele or the mceph allele had normal-sized hippocampus and ventral cortex.


CONCLUSIONS
total absence of kv <dig>  can induce excessive overgrowth of hippocampus and ventral cortex in mice with a balb/cbyj background, while mice with one wild type kv <dig>  allele develop normal-sized brains.
