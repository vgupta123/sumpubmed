BACKGROUND
genome annotation can be viewed as an incremental, cooperative, data-driven, knowledge-based process that involves multiple methods to predict gene locations and structures. this process might have to be executed more than once and might be subjected to several revisions as the biological  or methodological  knowledge evolves. in this context, although a lot of annotation platforms already exist, there is still a strong need for computer systems which take in charge, not only the primary annotation, but also the update and advance of the associated knowledge. in this paper, we propose to adopt a blackboard architecture for designing such a system


RESULTS
we have implemented a blackboard framework  for developing automatic annotation systems. the system is not bound to any specific annotation strategy. instead, the user will specify a blackboard structure in a configuration file and the system will instantiate and run this particular annotation strategy. the characteristics of this framework are presented and discussed. specific adaptations to the classical blackboard architecture have been required, such as the description of the activation patterns of the knowledge sources by using an extended set of allen's temporal relations. although the system is robust enough to be used on real-size applications, it is of primary use to bioinformatics researchers who want to experiment with blackboard architectures.


CONCLUSIONS
in the context of genome annotation, blackboards have several interesting features related to the way methodological and biological knowledge can be updated. they can readily handle the cooperative  and opportunistic  aspects of the annotation process.
