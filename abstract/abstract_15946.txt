BACKGROUND
formation of cellular malignancy results from the disruption of fine tuned signaling homeostasis for proliferation, accompanied by mal-functional signals for differentiation, cell cycle and apoptosis. we wanted to observe central signaling characteristics on a global view of malignant cells which have evolved to selfishness and independence in comparison to their non-malignant counterparts that fulfill well defined tasks in their sample.


RESULTS
we investigated the regulation of signaling networks with twenty microarray datasets from eleven different tumor types and their corresponding non-malignant tissue samples. proteins were represented by their coding genes and regulatory distances were defined by correlating the gene-regulation between neighboring proteins in the network . in cancer cells we observed shorter pathways, larger extension of the networks, a lower signaling frequency of central proteins and links and a higher information content of the network. proteins of high signaling frequency were enriched with cancer mutations. these proteins showed motifs of regulatory integration in normal cells which was disrupted in tumor cells.


CONCLUSIONS
our global analysis revealed a distinct formation of signaling-regulation in cancer cells when compared to cells of normal samples. from these cancer-specific regulation patterns novel signaling motifs are proposed.
