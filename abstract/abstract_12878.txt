BACKGROUND
bacterial artificial chromosomes  have been widely used as transgenes in vertebrate model systems such as mice and zebrafish, for a variety of studies. bac transgenesis has been a powerful tool to study the function of the genome, and gene regulation by distal cis-regulatory elements. recently, bac transgenesis in both mice and zebrafish was further facilitated by development of the transposon-mediated method using the tol <dig> element. tol <dig> ends, in the inverted orientation and flanking a  <dig> kb spacer dna , were introduced into the bac dna within the bacterial host using recombination of homologous sequences. here we describe experiments designed to determine if a simpler and more flexible system could modify bacs so that they would be suitable for transgenesis into zebrafish or mouse embryos using the tol <dig> transposase.


RESULTS
a new technique was developed to introduce recognition sequences for the tol <dig> transposase into bacs in e. coli using the tn <dig> transposon vector system. we constructed ptnloxp-itol2kan and ptnlox511-itol2kan to introduce the loxp or lox <dig> site and itol <dig> cassette, containing the tol <dig> cis-sequences in the inverted orientation, into bacs that have loxp and lox <dig> sites flanking genomic dna inserts by tn10-mediated transposition. the procedure enables rapid generation of a large collection of bacs ready for transgenesis with the itol <dig> cassette at the new end of a progressively truncated genomic insert via lox-cre recombination. the itol <dig> ends are efficiently recognized by the tol <dig> transposase, and the bacs readily integrate into zebrafish chromosomes.


CONCLUSIONS
the new technology described here can rapidly introduce itol <dig> ends at a bac end of choice, and simultaneously generate a large collection of bacs with progressive deletions of the genomic dna from that end in a single experiment. this procedure should be applicable to a wider variety of bacs containing lox sites flanking the genomic dna insert, including those with sequence repeats. the libraries of itol <dig> inserted bacs with truncations from an end should facilitate studies on the impact of distal cis-regulatory sequences on gene function, as well as standard bac transgenesis with precisely trimmed genes in zebrafish or mouse embryos using tol <dig> transposition.
