BACKGROUND
the activation and effector phenotype of t cells depend on the strength of the interaction of the tcr with its cognate antigen and additional signals provided by cytokines and by co-receptors. lymphocytes sense both the presence of an antigen and also clues from antigen-presenting cells, which dictate the requisite response. cd <dig> is one of the most abundant molecules on the surface of t cells; it mediates its own signalling events and cooperates with those mediated by the t cell receptor in t cell priming. we have examined the role of cd <dig> signals on the effector phenotype of adult cd4+ and cd8+ human t cells, both alone and in the presence of signals from the tcr.


RESULTS
cd <dig> signals direct the expression of ifnγ in human t cells. in freshly isolated cd4+ t cells, cd <dig> signals potentiated expression of the ifnγ gene induced by tcr activation; this was not seen in cd8+ t cells. in effector cells, cd <dig> signals alone induced the expression of the ifnγ gene in cd4+ t cells and to a lesser extent in cd8+ cells. the combined signals from cd <dig> and the tcr increased the transcription of the t-bet gene in cd4+ t cells and inhibited the transcription of the gata- <dig> gene in both populations of t cells, thus predisposing cd4+ t cells to commitment to the t <dig> lineage. in support of this, cd <dig> signals induced a transient membrane expression of the high-affinity chains of the receptors for il- <dig> and ifnγ in cd4+ t cells. cd <dig> and tcr signals also cooperated with those of il- <dig> in the induction of ifnγ expression. moreover, cd <dig> signals induced the co-clustering of ifnγr and the tcr and cooperated with tcr and il- <dig> signals, triggering a co-capping of both receptors in cd4+ populations, a phenomenon that has been associated with a t <dig> commitment.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest a key role for cd <dig> signals in the differentiation of human cd4+ t cells into a t <dig> pattern.
