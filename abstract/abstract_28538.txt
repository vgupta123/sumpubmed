BACKGROUND
in addition to erythrocytes, embryonic blood contains other differentiated cell lineages and potential progenitor or stem cells homed to changing niches as the embryo develops. using chicken as a model system, we have isolated an enriched pool of circulating non red blood cells  from e <dig> and e <dig> embryos; a transition period when definitive hematopoietic lineages are being specified in the peri-aortic region.


RESULTS
transcriptome analysis of both nrbc and rbc enriched populations was performed using chicken affymetrix gene expression arrays. comparison of transcript profiles of these two populations, with verification by rt-pcr, reveals in nrbcs an expression signature indicative of hematopoietic stem cells  and progenitor cells of myeloid and lymphoid lineages, as well as a number of previously undescribed genes possibly involved in progenitor and stem cell maintenance.


CONCLUSIONS
this data indicates that early circulating embryonic blood contains a full array of hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells. future studies on their heterogeneity and differentiation potentials may provide a useful alternative to es cells and perinatal blood.
