BACKGROUND
the appendage domain of the γcop subunit of the copi vesicle coat bears a striking structural resemblance to adaptin-family appendages despite limited primary sequence homology. both the γcop appendage domain and an equivalent region on βcop contain the fxxxw motif; the conservation of this motif suggested the existence of a functional appendage domain in βcop.


RESULTS
sequence comparisons in combination with structural prediction tools show that the fold of the cooh-terminus of sec26p is strongly predicted to closely mimic that of adaptin-family appendages. deletion of the appendage domain of sec26p results in inviability in yeast, over-expression of the deletion construct is dominant negative and mutagenesis of this region identifies residues critical for function. the arfgap glo3p was identified via suppression screening as a potential downstream modulator of sec26p in a manner that is independent of the gap activity of glo3p but requires the presence of the cooh-terminal iss motifs.


CONCLUSIONS
together, these results indicate an essential function for the predicted βcop appendage and suggest that both copi appendages perform a biologically active regulatory role with a structure related to adaptin-family appendage domains.
