BACKGROUND
obesity-associated organ-specific pathological states can be ensued from the dysregulation of the functions of the adipose tissues, liver and muscle. however, the influence of genetic differences underlying gross-compositional differences in these tissues is largely unknown. in the present study, the analytical method of atr-ftir spectroscopy has been combined with a genetic approach to identify genetic differences responsible for phenotypic alterations in adipose, liver and muscle tissues.


RESULTS
mice from  <dig> bxd recombinant inbred mouse strains were put on high fat diet and gross-compositional changes in adipose, liver and muscle tissues were measured by atr-ftir spectroscopy. the analysis of genotype-phenotype correlations revealed significant quantitative trait loci  on chromosome  <dig> for the content of fat and collagen, collagen integrity, and the lipid to protein ratio in adipose tissue and on chromosome  <dig> for lipid to protein ratio in liver. using gene expression and sequence information, we suggest rsad <dig>  and colec <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> as potential quantitative trait candidate genes. rsad <dig> may act as a modulator of lipid droplet contents and lipid biosynthesis; colec <dig> might play a role in apoptopic cell clearance and maintenance of adipose tissue. an increased level of rsad <dig> transcripts in adipose tissue of dba/2j compared to c57bl/6j mice suggests a cis-acting genetic variant leading to differential gene activation.


CONCLUSIONS
the results demonstrate that the analytical method of atr-ftir spectroscopy effectively contributed to decompose the macromolecular composition of tissues that accumulate fat and to link this information with genetic determinants. the candidate genes in the qtl regions may contribute to obesity-related diseases in humans, in particular if the results can be verified in a bigger bxd cohort.
