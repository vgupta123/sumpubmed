BACKGROUND
at least two genetically different porcine epidemic diarrhea virus  strains have been identified in the united states . the current serological assays offered at veterinary diagnostic laboratories for detection of pedv-specific antibody are based on the u.s. pedv prototype strain. the objectives of this study were: 1) isolate the u.s. pedv s-indel-variant strain in cell culture; 2) generate antisera against the u.s. pedv prototype and s-indel-variant strains by experimentally infecting weaned pigs; 3) determine if the various pedv serological assays could detect antibodies against the u.s. pedv s-indel-variant strain and vice versa.


RESULTS
a u.s. pedv s-indel-variant strain was isolated in cell culture in this study. three groups of pedv-negative, 3-week-old pigs  were inoculated orally with a u.s. pedv prototype isolate , an s-indel-variant isolate or virus-negative culture medium. serum samples collected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 28 days post inoculation were evaluated by the following pedv serological assays: 1) indirect fluorescent antibody  assays using the prototype and s-indel-variant strains as indicator viruses; 2) virus neutralization  tests against the prototype and s-indel-variant viruses; 3) pedv prototype strain whole virus based elisa; 4) pedv prototype strain s1-based elisa; and 5) pedv s-indel-variant strain s1-based elisa. the positive antisera against the prototype strain reacted to and neutralized both prototype and s-indel-variant viruses, and the positive antisera against the s-indel-variant strain also reacted to and neutralized both prototype and s-indel-variant viruses, as examined by ifa antibody assays and vn tests. antibodies against the two pedv strains could be detected by all three elisas although detection rates varied to some degree.


CONCLUSIONS
these data indicate that the antibodies against u.s. pedv prototype and s-indel-variant strains cross-reacted and cross-neutralized both strains in vitro. the current serological assays based on u.s. pedv prototype strain can detect antibodies against both u.s. pedv strains.
