BACKGROUND
cytokinins  are involved in response to various environmental cues, including salinity. it has been previously reported that enhancing ck contents improved salt stress tolerance in tomato. however, the underlying mechanisms of ck metabolism and signaling under salt stress conditions remain to be deciphered.


RESULTS
two tomato isopentenyltransferases, slipt <dig> and slipt <dig>  were characterized in tomato and arabidopsis. both proteins displayed isopentenyltransferase  activity in vitro, while their encoding genes exhibited different spatio-temporal expression patterns during tomato plant development. slipt <dig> and slipt <dig> were affected by the endogenous ck status, tightly connected with cks feedback regulation, as revealed by hormonal treatements. in response to salt stress, slipt <dig> and slipt <dig> were strongly repressed in tomato roots, and differently affected in young and old leaves. slipt <dig> overexpression in tomato resulted in high accumulation of different ck metabolites, following modifications of ck biosynthesis-, signaling- and degradation-gene expression. in addition, 35s::slipt <dig> tomato plants displayed improved tolerance to salinity consecutive to photosynthetic pigments and k+/na+ ratio retention. involvement of slipt <dig> and slipt <dig> in salt stress response was also observed in arabidopsis ipt <dig> knock-out complemented plants, through maintenance of ck homeostasis.


CONCLUSIONS
slipt <dig> and slipt <dig> are functional ipts encoded by differently expressed genes, distinctively taking part in the salinity response. the substantial participation of slipt <dig> in ck metabolism during salt stress has been determined in 35s::slipt <dig> tomato transformants, where enhancement of cks accumulation significantly improved plant tolerance to salinity, underlining the importance of this phytohormone in stress response.
