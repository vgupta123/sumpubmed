BACKGROUND
codon optimization and subcellular targeting were studied with the aim to increase the expression levels of the sag178- <dig> antigen of toxoplasma gondii in tobacco leaves. the expression of the tobacco-optimized and native versions of the sag <dig> gene was explored by transient expression from the agrobacterium tumefaciens binary expression vector, which allows targeting the recombinant protein to the endoplasmic reticulum  and the apoplast. finally, mice were subcutaneously and orally immunized with leaf extracts-sag <dig> and the strategy of prime boost with rsag <dig> expressed in escherichia coli was used to optimize the oral immunization with leaf extracts-sag <dig> 


RESULTS
leaves agroinfiltrated with an unmodified sag <dig> gene accumulated 5- to 10-fold more than leaves agroinfiltrated with a codon-optimized sag <dig> gene. er localization allowed the accumulation of higher levels of native sag <dig>  however, no significant differences were observed between the mrna accumulations of the different versions of sag <dig>  subcutaneous immunization with leaf extracts-sag <dig>  protected mice against an oral challenge with a non-lethal cyst dose, and this effect could be associated with the secretion of significant levels of ifn-γ. the protection was increased when mice were id boosted with rsag <dig> . this group elicited a significant th <dig> humoral and cellular immune response characterized by high levels of ifn-γ. in an oral immunization assay, the sag1+boost group showed a significantly lower brain cyst burden compared to the rest of the groups.


CONCLUSIONS
transient agroinfiltration was useful for the expression of all of the recombinant proteins tested. our results support the usefulness of endoplasmic reticulum signal peptides in enhancing the production of recombinant proteins meant for use as vaccines. the results showed that this plant-produced protein has potential for use as vaccine and provides a potential means for protecting humans and animals against toxoplasmosis.
