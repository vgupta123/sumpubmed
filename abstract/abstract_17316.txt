BACKGROUND
the low-phosphate-tolerant maize mutant qi319- <dig> was obtained from qi <dig> through cellular engineering. to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the low-phosphate tolerance of this mutant, we performed comparative proteome analyses of the leaves of qi319- <dig> and qi <dig> under inorganic phosphate -sufficient and pi-deficient conditions.


RESULTS
low-phosphorus levels limit plant growth and metabolism. although the overall phosphorus contents of shoots were not significantly different between qi <dig> and qi319- <dig>  the pi level of qi319- <dig> was  <dig>  % higher than that of qi <dig>  under low phosphorus conditions, qi319- <dig> had increased chlorophyll levels and enhanced photosynthesis. the changes in starch and sucrose contents under these conditions also differed between genotypes. the proteomic changes included  <dig>  and  <dig>  differentially expressed proteins involved in numerous metabolic processes. proteome and physiological analyses revealed that qi319- <dig> could better remodel the lipid composition of membranes and had higher v-atpase activity levels than qi <dig> under low-phosphate starvation, which enhanced the recycling of intracellular pi, as reflected by its increased pi levels. chlorophyll biosynthesis was improved and the levels, and activities, of several calvin cycle and “co <dig> pump” enzymes were greater in qi319- <dig> than in qi <dig>  which led to a higher rate of photosynthesis under low-phosphate stress in this line compared with in qi <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that the increased tolerance of the maize mutant qi319- <dig> to low-phosphate levels is owing to its ability to increase pi availability. additionally, inbred lines of maize with low-p-tolerant traits could be obtained effectively through cellular engineering.
