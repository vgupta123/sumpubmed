BACKGROUND
addison's disease, also known as hypoadrenocorticism, has been reported in many individual dogs, although some breeds exhibit a greater incidence than the population as a whole. addison's is presumed to be an autoimmune mediated hereditary defect but the mode of inheritance remains unclear. in particular, the heritability and mode of inheritance have not been defined for the portuguese water dog although addison's is known to be prevalent in the breed.


RESULTS
the analyses present clear evidence that establishes addison's disease as an inherited disorder in the portuguese water dog with an estimate of heritability of  <dig>  ; there were no differences in risk for disease across sexes . further, the complex segregation analysis provides suggestive evidence that addison's disease in the portuguese water dog is inherited under the control of a single, autosomal recessive locus.


CONCLUSIONS
the high heritability and mode of inheritance of addison's disease in the portuguese water dog should enable the detection of segregating markers in a genome-wide scan and the identification of a locus linked to addison's. though the confirmation of addison's disease as an autosomal recessive disorder must wait until the gene is identified, breeders of these dogs may wish to keep the present findings in mind as they plan their breeding programs to select against producing affected dogs.
