BACKGROUND
cellular differentiation is characterized by the acquisition of specialized structures and functions, cell cycle exit, and global attenuation of the dna damage response. it is largely unknown how these diverse cellular events are coordinated at the molecular level during differentiation. we addressed this question in a model system of neuroblastoma cell differentiation induced by hoxc <dig> 


RESULTS
we conducted a genome-wide analysis of the hoxc9-induced neuronal differentiation program. microarray gene expression profiling revealed that hoxc9-induced differentiation was associated with transcriptional regulation of  <dig>  genes, characterized by global upregulation of neuronal genes and downregulation of cell cycle and dna repair genes. remarkably, genome-wide mapping by chip-seq demonstrated that hoxc <dig> bound to 40% of these genes, including a large number of genes involved in neuronal differentiation, cell cycle progression and the dna damage response. moreover, we showed that hoxc <dig> interacted with the transcriptional repressor e2f <dig> and recruited it to the promoters of cell cycle genes for repressing their expression.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that hoxc <dig> coordinates diverse cellular processes associated with differentiation by directly activating and repressing the transcription of distinct sets of genes.
