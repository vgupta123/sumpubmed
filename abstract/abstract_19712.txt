BACKGROUND
previous work from our laboratory showed that  vertebrate genomes are mosaics of isochores, typically megabase-size dna segments that are fairly homogeneous in base composition;  isochores belong to a small number of families  characterized by different gc levels;  isochore family patterns are different in fishes/amphibians and mammals/birds, the latter showing gc-rich isochore families that are absent or very scarce in the former;  there are two modes of genome evolution, a conservative one in which isochore patterns basically do not change , and a transitional one, in which they do change ; and  isochores are tightly linked to a number of basic biological properties, such as gene density, gene expression, replication timing and recombination.


RESULTS
the present availability of a number of fully sequenced genomes ranging from fishes to mammals allowed us to carry out investigations that  more precisely quantified our previous conclusions;  showed that the different isochore families of vertebrate genomes are largely conserved in gc levels and dinucleotide frequencies, as well as in isochore size; and  isochore family patterns can be either conserved or change within both warm- and cold-blooded vertebrates.


CONCLUSIONS
on the basis of the results presented, we propose that  the large conservation of gc levels and dinucleotide frequencies may reflect the conservation of chromatin structures;  the conservation of isochore size may be linked to the role played by isochores in chromosome structure and replication;  the formation, the maintainance and the changes of isochore patterns are due to natural selection.
