BACKGROUND
somatic embryogenesis  is an asexual propagation pathway requiring a somatic-to-embryonic transition of differentiated somatic cells toward embryogenic cells capable of producing embryos in a process resembling zygotic embryogenesis. in chicory, genetic variability with respect to the formation of somatic embryos was detected between plants from a population of cichorium intybus l. landrace koospol. though all plants from this population were self incompatible, we managed by repeated selfing to obtain a few seeds from one highly embryogenic  plant, k <dig>  among the plants grown from these seeds, one plant, c <dig>  was found to be non-embryogenic  under our se-inducing conditions. being closely related, we decided to exploit the difference in se capacity between k <dig> and its descendant c <dig> to study gene expression during the early stages of se in chicory.


RESULTS
cytological analysis indicated that in k <dig> leaf explants the first cell divisions leading to se were observed at day  <dig> of culture. in contrast, in c <dig> explants no cell divisions were observed and se development seemed arrested before cell reactivation. using mrnas isolated from leaf explants from both genotypes after  <dig> days of culture under se-inducing conditions, an e and a ne cdna-library were generated by ssh. a total of  <dig>  ests from both libraries turned out to represent a maximum of  <dig>  genes. in silico subtraction analysis sorted only  <dig> genes as differentially expressed in the e or ne genotype, indicating that ssh had resulted in an effective normalisation. real-time rt-pcr was used to verify the expression levels of  <dig> genes represented by ests from either library. the results showed preferential expression of genes related to protein synthesis and cell division in the e genotype, and related to defence in the ne genotype.


CONCLUSIONS
in accordance with the cytological observations, mrna levels in explants from k <dig> and c <dig> collected at day  <dig> of se culture reflected differential gene expression that presumably are related to processes accompanying early stages of direct se. the e and ne library obtained thus represent important tools for subsequent detailed analysis of molecular mechanisms underlying this process in chicory, and its genetic control.
