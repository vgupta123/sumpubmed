BACKGROUND
bovine anaplasmosis has been reported in several european countries, but the vector competency of tick species for anaplasma marginale from these localities has not been determined. because of the wide distributional range of dermacentor reticulatus within europe and the major role of dermacentor spp. as a vector of a. marginale in the united states, we tested the vector competency of d. reticulatus for a. marginale.


RESULTS
male d. reticulatus were allowed to feed for  <dig> days on a calf persistently infected with a zaria isolate of a. marginale, after which they were removed and held off-host for  <dig> days. the ticks were then allowed to feed a second time for  <dig> days on a susceptible tick-na√Øve calf. infection of calf no.  <dig> was detected  <dig> days post exposure  and confirmed by msp <dig> pcr. thirty percent of the dissected acquisition fed ticks was infected. in addition, a. marginale colonies were detected by light microscopy in the salivary glands of the acquisition fed ticks. transmission of a. marginale to calf no.  <dig> was confirmed by examination of giemsa-stained blood smears and msp <dig> pcr. ticks were dissected after transmission feeding and presence of a. marginale was confirmed in  <dig> % of the dissected ticks.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that d. reticulatus males are competent vectors of a. marginale. further studies are needed to confirm the vector competency of d. reticulatus for other a. marginale strains from geographic areas in europe.
