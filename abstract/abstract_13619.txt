BACKGROUND
hybridization and reproductive isolation are central to the origin and maintenance of species, and especially for sympatric species, gene flow is often inhibited through barriers that depend upon mating compatibility factors. the anther-smut fungi  serve as models for speciation in the face of sympatry, and previous studies have tested for but not detected assortative mating. in addition, post-mating barriers are indicated by reduced fitness of hybrids, but sources of those barriers  have not yet been detected. here, backcrossing experiments, specifically controlling for the fungal species origins of the mating compatibility factors, were used to investigate reproductive isolation in the recently-derived species microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae and microbotryum silenes-dioicae.


RESULTS
assortative mating was detected during backcrossing and was manifested by the preferential conjugation of the hybrid-produced gametes with non-hybrid gametes containing mating compatibility factors from the same parental species. patterns of post-mating performance supported either a level of extrinsic isolation mechanism, where backcross progeny with a higher proportion of the pathogen genome adapted to the particular host environment were favored, or an infection advantage attributed to greater genetic contribution to the hybrid from the m. lychnidis-dioicae genome.


CONCLUSIONS
the use of controlled backcrossing experiments reveals significant species-specific mating type effects on conjugations between recently-derived sister species, which are likely to play important roles in both maintaining species separation and the nature of hybrids lineages that emerge in sympatry between microbotryum species.
