BACKGROUND
cell organization is governed and maintained via specific interactions among its constituent macromolecules. comparison of the experimentally determined protein interaction networks in different model organisms has revealed little conservation of the specific edges linking ortholog proteins. nevertheless, some topological characteristics of the graphs representing the networks - namely non-random degree distribution and high clustering coefficient - are shared by networks of distantly related organisms. here we investigate the role of the topological features of the protein interaction network in promoting cell organization.

methods
we have used a stochastic model, dubbed protnet representing a computer stylized cell to answer questions about the dynamic consequences of the topological properties of the static graphs representing protein interaction networks.


RESULTS
by using a novel metrics of cell organization, we show that natural networks, differently from random networks, can promote cell self-organization. furthermore the ensemble of protein complexes that forms in pseudocells, which self-organize according to the interaction rules of natural networks, are more robust to perturbations.


CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of the dynamic properties of networks with a variety of topological characteristics lead us to conclude that self organization is a consequence of the high clustering coefficient, whereas the scale free degree distribution has little influence on this property.
