BACKGROUND
we examined development of auditory temporal integration and inhibition by assessing electrophysiological responses to tone pairs separated by interstimulus intervals  of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ms in  <dig> children aged  <dig> to  <dig> years, and  <dig> adults.


RESULTS
in adults a distinct neural response was elicited to tones presented at isis of  <dig> ms or longer, whereas in children this was only seen in response to tones presented at isis above  <dig> ms. in adults, late n <dig> amplitude was larger for the second tone of the tone pair when separated by isis as short as  <dig> ms, consistent with the perceptual integration of successive stimuli within the temporal window of integration. in contrast, children showed enhanced negativity only when tone pairs were separated by isis of  <dig> ms. in children, the amplitude of the p <dig> component was attenuated at isis below  <dig> ms, consistent with a refractory process.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that adults integrate sequential auditory information into smaller temporal segments than children. these results suggest that there are marked maturational changes from childhood to adulthood in the perceptual processes underpinning the grouping of incoming auditory sensory information, and that electrophysiological measures provide a sensitive, non-invasive method allowing further examination of these changes.
