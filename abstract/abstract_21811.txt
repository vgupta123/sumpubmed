BACKGROUND
in rodents and pigs, it has shown that carnitine synthesis and uptake of carnitine into cells are regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α , a transcription factor which is physiologically activated during fasting or energy deprivation. dairy cows are typically in a negative energy balance during early lactation. we investigated the hypothesis that genes of carnitine synthesis and uptake in dairy cows are enhanced during early lactation.


RESULTS
mrna abundances of ppara and some of its classical target genes and genes involved in carnitine biosynthesis  and uptake of carnitine  as well as carnitine concentrations in liver biopsy samples of  <dig> dairy cows in late pregnancy  and early lactation  were determined. from  <dig> wk prepartum to  <dig> wk postpartum, mrna abundances of pparΑ and several pparΑ target genes involved in fatty acid uptake, fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis in the liver were strongly increased. simultaneously, mrna abundances of enzymes of carnitine synthesis  and carnitine uptake  and the concentration of carnitine in the liver were increased from  <dig> wk prepartum to  <dig> wk postpartum . from  <dig> wk to  <dig> and  <dig> wk postpartum, mrna abundances of these genes and hepatic carnitine concentrations were declining . there were moreover positive correlations between plasma concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids  and hepatic carnitine concentrations at  <dig> wk,  <dig> wk and  <dig> wk postpartum .


CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study show for the first time that the expression of hepatic genes of carnitine synthesis and cellular uptake of carnitine is enhanced in dairy cows during early lactation. these changes might provide an explanation for increased hepatic carnitine concentrations observed in  <dig> wk postpartum and might be regarded as a physiologic means to provide liver cells with sufficient carnitine required for transport of excessive amounts of nefa during a negative energy balance.
