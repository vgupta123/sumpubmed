BACKGROUND
lactococcus garvieae is a bacterial pathogen that affects different animal species in addition to humans. despite the widespread distribution and emerging clinical significance of l. garvieae in both veterinary and human medicine, there is almost a complete lack of knowledge about the genetic content of this microorganism. in the present study, the genomic content of l. garvieae cect  <dig> was analysed using bioinformatics tools and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization  experiments. lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il <dig> and streptococcus pneumoniae tigr <dig> were used as reference microorganisms.


RESULTS
the combination and integration of in silico analyses and in vitro cgh experiments, performed in comparison with the reference microorganisms, allowed establishment of an inter-species hybridization framework with a detection threshold based on a sequence similarity of â‰¥ 70%. with this threshold value,  <dig> genes were identified as having an analogue in l. garvieae, most of which  have been documented for the first time in this pathogen. most of the genes are related to ribosomal, sugar metabolism or energy conversion systems. some of the identified genes, such as als and myca, could be involved in the pathogenesis of l. garvieae infections.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified  <dig> genes that were potentially present in l. garvieae cect  <dig>  some of the identified genes could be involved in the pathogenesis of l. garvieae infections. these results provide the first insight into the genome content of l. garvieae.
