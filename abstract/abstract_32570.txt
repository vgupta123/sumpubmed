BACKGROUND
a central goal in huntington's disease  research is to identify and prioritize candidate targets for neuroprotective intervention, which requires genome-scale information on the modifiers of early-stage neuron injury in hd.


RESULTS
here, we performed a large-scale rna interference screen in c. elegans strains that express n-terminal huntingtin  in touch receptor neurons. these neurons control the response to light touch. their function is strongly impaired by expanded polyglutamines  as shown by the nearly complete loss of touch response in adult animals, providing an in vivo model in which to manipulate the early phases of expanded-polyq neurotoxicity. in total,  <dig> genes were examined, revealing  <dig> gene inactivations that either reduce or aggravate defective touch response in 128q animals. several genes were previously implicated in hd or neurodegenerative disease, suggesting that this screen has effectively identified candidate targets for hd. network-based analysis emphasized a subset of high-confidence modifier genes in pathways of interest in hd including metabolic, neurodevelopmental and pro-survival pathways. finally,  <dig> modifiers of 128q-neuron dysfunction that are dysregulated in the striatum of either r/ <dig> or chl <dig> hd mice, or both, were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, these results highlight the relevance to hd pathogenesis, providing novel information on the potential therapeutic targets for neuroprotection in hd.
