BACKGROUND
crown rust, caused by puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae, is the most important disease of oat worldwide. adult plant resistance , based upon partial resistance, has proven to be a durable rust management strategy in other cereal rust pathosystems. the crown rust apr in the oat line mn <dig> has been effective for more than 30 years. the genetic basis of this apr was studied under field conditions in three recombinant inbred line  populations: 1) ac assiniboia/mn <dig>  2) ac medallion/mn <dig>  and 3) makuru/mn <dig>  the populations were evaluated for crown rust resistance with the crown rust isolate cr <dig>  in multiple environments. the 6 k oat and 90 k wheat illumina infinium single nucleotide polymorphism  arrays were used for genotyping the ac assiniboia/mn <dig> population. kasp assays were designed for selected snps and genotyped on the other two populations.


RESULTS
this study reports a high density genetic linkage map constructed with oat and wheat snp markers in the ac assiniboia/mn <dig> ril population. most wheat snps were monomorphic in the oat population. however the polymorphic wheat snps could be scored accurately and integrated well into the linkage map. a major quantitative trait locus  on oat chromosome 14d, designated qpc.crc-14d, explained up to 76% of the apr phenotypic variance. this qtl is flanked by two snp markers, gmi_gbs_ <dig> and gmi_es14_c1439_ <dig>  qpc.crc-14d was validated in the populations ac medallion/mn <dig> and makuru/mn <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we report the first apr qtl in oat with a large and consistent effect. qpc.crc-14d was statistically significant in all environments tested in each of the three oat populations. qpc.crc-14d is a suitable candidate for use in marker-assisted breeding and also an excellent target for map-based cloning. this is also the first study to use the 90 k wheat infinium snp array on oat for marker development and comparative mapping. the infinium snp array is a useful tool for saturating oat maps with markers. synteny with wheat suggests that qpc.crc-14d is orthologous with the stripe rust apr gene yr <dig> in wheat.
