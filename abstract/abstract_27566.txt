BACKGROUND
the shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig> genome encodes a predicted orphan dna-binding response regulator, so <dig>  previous studies with a so2426-deficient mr- <dig> strain suggested a putative functional role for so <dig> in the regulation of iron acquisition genes, in particular, the siderophore  biosynthesis operon so3030-3031- <dig>  to further investigate the functional role of so <dig> in iron homeostasis, we employed computational strategies to identify putative gene targets of so <dig> regulation and biochemical approaches to validate the participation of so <dig> in the control of siderophore biosynthesis in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> 


RESULTS
in silico prediction analyses revealed a single 14-bp consensus motif consisting of two tandem conserved pentamers  in the upstream regulatory regions of  <dig> genes, which were shown previously to be significantly down-regulated in a so <dig> deletion mutant. these genes included so <dig> and so <dig>  members of an annotated siderophore biosynthetic operon in mr- <dig>  electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that the so <dig> protein binds to its motif in the operator region of so <dig>  a "short" form of so <dig>  beginning with a methionine at position  <dig>  of the originally annotated coding sequence for so <dig>  was also functional in binding to its consensus motif, confirming previous 5' race results that suggested that amino acid m <dig> is the actual translation start codon for so <dig>  alignment of so <dig> orthologs from all sequenced shewanella spp. showed a high degree of sequence conservation beginning at m <dig>  in addition to conservation of a putative aspartyl phosphorylation residue and the helix-turn-helix  dna-binding domain. finally, the so <dig> deletion mutant was unable to synthesize siderophores at wild-type rates upon exposure to the iron chelator  <dig> '-dipyridyl.


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, these data support the functional characterization of so <dig> as a positive regulator of siderophore-mediated iron acquisition and provide the first insight into a coordinate program of multiple regulatory schemes controlling iron homeostasis in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>
