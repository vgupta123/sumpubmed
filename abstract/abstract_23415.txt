BACKGROUND
allergen immunotherapy  is the only treatment for allergic disease capable of modifying disease long term. to reduce the risk of anaphylaxis from sit, allergen-extracts have been modified by polymerisation with glutaraldehyde to reduce ige binding. it is suggested that these allergoid extracts also have reduced t cell activity, which could compromise clinical efficacy. effective sit is thought to act through regulatory t cells  rather than activation of effector t cells. there is no published data on the activity of modified extracts on tregs.


RESULTS
we compared the capacity of modified  versus unmodified  allergen extracts of grass pollen and house dust mite to stimulate proliferation/cytokine production and to modulate treg/effector t cell frequency in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells , from volunteers sensitised to both allergens in vitro. depigmented-polymerised allergen extracts stimulated less proliferation of pbmc, and reduced effector cell numbers after 7 days in culture than did native extracts. however, the frequency of foxp3+ tregs in cultures were similar to those seen with native extract so that ratios of regulatory to effector t cells were significantly increased in cultures stimulated with depigmented-polymerised extracts. addition of 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> further favoured treg, and reduced effector cytokine production, but not interleukin- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
depigmented-polymerised allergen extracts appear to favour treg expansion over activation of effector t cells and this may relate to their demonstrated efficacy and safety in sit. 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> further reduces effector t cell activation by allergen extracts and may be a useful adjuvant for sit.
