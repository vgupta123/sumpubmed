BACKGROUND
placental defects in somatic cell nuclear transfer  are a major cause of complications during pregnancy. one of the most critical factors for the success of scnt is the successful epigenetic reprogramming of donor cells. recently, it was reported that the placental weight in mice cloned with the aggregated scnt method was significantly reduced. here, we examine the profile of abnormal gene expression using microarray technology in both regular scnt and aggregated scnt placentas as well as in vivo fertilization placentas. one scnt embryo was aggregated with two  <dig> to  <dig> -cell stage tetraploid embryos from b6d2f <dig> mice .


RESULTS
in scnt placentas,  <dig>  of the  <dig>  genes probed were either up-regulated or down-regulated by more than two-fold. however,  <dig> genes  showed differential expression in aggregated scnt placentas compared to that in controls. in comparison of both types of scnt placentas with the controls,  <dig>  out of  <dig> genes were found to be up-regulated  in scnt placentas. among  <dig> genes,  <dig>  genes were up-regulated in the aggregated scnt placentas. eighty-five genes were down-regulated in scnt placentas compared with the controls. however, only  <dig>  genes were down-regulated in the aggregated scnt placentas. of the  <dig> genes known as imprinted genes, expression was lower in scnt placentas than that in the controls. thus, these genes may be the cause of placentomegaly in mice produced post scnt.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that placentomegaly in the scnt placentas was probably caused by abnormal expression of multiple genes. taken together, these results suggest that abnormal gene expression in cloned placentas was reduced in a genome-wide manner using the aggregation method with tetraploid embryos.
