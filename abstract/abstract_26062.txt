BACKGROUND
the assembly of nucleosomes to higher-order chromatin structures is finely tuned by the relative affinities of histones for chaperones and nucleosomal binding sites. the myeloid leukaemia protein set/taf-iβ belongs to the nap <dig> family of histone chaperones and participates in several chromatin-based mechanisms, such as chromatin assembly, nucleosome reorganisation and transcriptional activation. to better understand the histone chaperone function of set/taf-iβ, we designed several set/taf-iβ truncations, examined their structural integrity by circular dichroism and assessed qualitatively and quantitatively the histone binding properties of wild-type protein and mutant forms using gst-pull down experiments and fluorescence spectroscopy-based binding assays.


RESULTS
wild type set/taf-iβ binds to histones h2b and h <dig> with kd values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm, respectively. the preferential binding of set/taf-iβ to histone h <dig> is mediated by its central region and the globular part of h <dig>  on the contrary, the acidic c-terminal tail and the amino-terminal dimerisation domain of set/taf-iβ, as well as the h <dig> amino-terminal tail, are dispensable for this interaction.


CONCLUSIONS
this type of analysis allowed us to assess the relative affinities of set/taf-iβ for different histones and identify the domains of the protein required for effective histone recognition. our findings are consistent with recent structural studies of set/taf-iβ and can be valuable to understand the role of set/taf-iβ in chromatin function.
