BACKGROUND
mammalian gli proteins are important transcription factors involved in the regulation of sonic hedgehog signal transduction pathway. association of gli <dig> with mammalian development and human disease led us to study the structure and expression of the human gli <dig> 


RESULTS
we show that the region encoding gli <dig> repressor domain is subject to alternative splicing in the gonadal tissues and different cell lines. two major alternatively spliced forms of gli <dig> mrna arise from skipping exon  <dig>  or exons  <dig> and  <dig> . both forms contain premature translational stop codons in the gli <dig> open reading frame  starting from exon  <dig>  translation of gli2Δ <dig> and gli2Δ4– <dig> in vitro, initiated from downstream aug codons, produced n-terminally truncated proteins. in gli-dependent transactivation assay, expression of gli2Δ <dig> induced activation of the reporter gene similar to that of the full-length construct  containing complete orf. however, expression of the gli2Δ4– <dig> resulted in about 10-fold increase in activation, suggesting that deletion of the major part of repressor domain was responsible for the enhanced activation of gli <dig> protein.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that in addition to proteolytic processing, alternative splicing may be another important regulatory mechanism for the modulation of repressor and activator properties of gli <dig> protein.
