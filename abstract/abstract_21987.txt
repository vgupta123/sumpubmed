BACKGROUND
huntington’s disease  is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion in the polyglutamine  region of the huntingtin  gene. the clinical features of hd are characterized by cognitive, psychological, and motor deficits. molecular instability, a core component in neurological disease progression, can be comprehensively evaluated through longitudinal transcriptomic profiling. development of animal models amenable to longitudinal examination enables distinct disease-associated mechanisms to be identified.


RESULTS
here we report the first longitudinal study of transgenic monkeys with genomic integration of various lengths of the human htt gene and a range of polyq repeats. with this unique group of transgenic hd nonhuman primates , we profiled over  <dig>  transcripts from peripheral blood collected over a 2 year timespan from hd monkeys and age-matched wild-type control monkeys.


CONCLUSIONS
messenger rnas with expression patterns which diverged with disease progression in the hd monkeys considerably facilitated our search for transcripts with diagnostic or therapeutic potential in the blood of human hd patients, opening up a new avenue for clinical investigation.
