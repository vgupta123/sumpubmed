BACKGROUND
cotton fiber, a natural fiber widely used in the textile industry, is differentiated from single cell of ovule epidermis. a large number of genes are believed to be involved in fiber formation, but so far only a few fiber genes have been isolated and functionally characterized in this developmental process. the kinesin <dig> subfamily was found to play key roles during cell division and cell elongation, and was considered to be involved in the regulation of cotton fiber development.


RESULTS
the full length of coding sequence of ghkis13a <dig> was cloned using cdna from cotton fiber for functional characterization. expression pattern analysis showed that ghkis13a <dig> maintained a lower expression level during cotton fiber development. biochemical assay showed that ghkis13a <dig> has microtubule binding activity and basal atpase activity that can be activated significantly by the presence of microtubules. overexpression of ghkis13a <dig> in arabidopsis reduced leaf trichomes and the percentage of three-branch trichomes, and increased two-branch and shriveled trichomes compared to wild-type. additionally, the expression of ghkis13a <dig> in the arabidopsis kinesin-13a- <dig> mutant rescued the defective trichome branching pattern of the mutant, making its overall trichome branching pattern back to normal.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggested that ghkis13a <dig> is functionally compatible with atkinesin-13a regarding their role in regulating the number and branching pattern of leaf trichomes. given the developmental similarities between cotton fibers and arabidopsis trichomes, it is speculated that ghkis13a <dig> may also be involved in the regulation of cotton fiber development.
