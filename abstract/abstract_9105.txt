BACKGROUND
although the plastid genome is highly conserved across most angiosperms, multiple lineages have increased rates of structural rearrangement and nucleotide substitution. these lineages exhibit an excess of nonsynonymous substitutions  in similar subsets of plastid genes, suggesting that similar mechanisms may be leading to relaxed and/or positive selection on these genes. however, little is known regarding whether these mechanisms continue to shape sequence diversity at the intraspecific level.


RESULTS
we examined patterns of interspecific divergence and intraspecific polymorphism in the plastid genome of campanulastrum americanum, and across plastid genes found a significant correlation between dn/ds and pn/ps . a number of genes including ycf <dig>  ycf <dig>  clpp, and ribosomal protein genes exhibited high dn/ds ratios. mcdonald-kreitman tests detected little evidence for positive selection acting on these genes, likely due to the presence of substantial intraspecific divergence.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that mechanisms leading to increased nucleotide substitution rates in the plastid genome are continuing to act at the intraspecific level. accelerated plastid genome evolution may increase the likelihood of intraspecific cytonuclear genetic incompatibilities, and thereby contribute to the early stages of the speciation process.
