BACKGROUND
field observations and a few physiological studies have demonstrated that peach embryogenesis and fruit development are tightly coupled. in fact, attempts to stimulate parthenocarpic fruit development by means of external tools have failed. moreover, physiological disturbances during early embryo development lead to seed abortion and fruitlet abscission. later in embryo development, the interactions between seed and fruit development become less strict. as there is limited genetic and molecular information about seed-pericarp cross-talk and development in peach, a massive gene approach based on the use of the Î¼peach  <dig>  array platform and quantitative real time rt-pcr  was used to study this process.


RESULTS
a comparative analysis of the transcription profiles conducted in seed and mesocarp  throughout different developmental stages  evidenced that  <dig> genes are differentially expressed in seed and fruit. among differentially expressed genes some were validated as markers in two subsequent years and in three different genotypes. seed markers were a ltp <dig> , a pr  protein, a prunin and lea  protein, for s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively. mesocarp markers were a rd22-like protein, a serin-carboxypeptidase, a senescence related protein and an aux/iaa, for s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively.

the microarray data, analyzed by using the hormonometer platform, allowed the identification of hormone-responsive genes, some of them putatively involved in seed-pericarp crosstalk. results indicated that auxin, cytokinins, and gibberellins are good candidates, acting either directly  or indirectly as signals during early development, when the cross-talk is more active and vital for fruit set, whereas abscisic acid and ethylene may be involved later on.


CONCLUSIONS
in this research, genes were identified marking different phases of seed and mesocarp development. the selected genes behaved as good seed markers, while for mesocarp their reliability appeared to be dependent upon developmental and ripening traits. regarding the cross-talk between seed and pericarp, possible candidate signals were identified among hormones.

further investigations relying upon the availability of whole genome platforms will allow the enrichment of a marker genes repertoire and the elucidation of players other than hormones that are involved in seed-pericarp cross-talk .
