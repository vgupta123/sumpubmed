BACKGROUND
ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig> are transcriptional co-repressors that modulate the activity of a large number of transcriptional repressors via the recruitment of chromatin modifiers. many ctbp-regulated proteins are involved in pathways associated with tumorigenesis, including tgf-β and wnt signalling pathways and cell cycle regulators such as rb/p <dig> and hdm <dig>  as well as adenovirus e1a. ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig> are highly similar proteins, although evidence is emerging that their activity can be differentially regulated, particularly through the control of their subcellular localisation. ctbp2s from diverse species contain a unique n-terminus, absent in ctbp <dig> that plays a key role in controlling the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of the protein.


RESULTS
here we show that amino acids  4– <dig> of ctbp <dig> direct ctbp <dig> into an almost exclusively nuclear distribution in cell lines of diverse origins. whilst this sequence contains similarity to known nuclear localisation motifs, it cannot drive nuclear localisation of a heterologous protein, but rather has been shown to function as a p <dig> acetyltransferase-dependent nuclear retention sequence. here we define the region of ctbp <dig> required to co-operate with a.a. 4– <dig> to promote ctbp <dig> nuclear accumulation as being within a.a. 1– <dig>  in addition, we show that a.a. 120– <dig> of ctbp <dig> can also promote ctbp <dig> nuclear accumulation, independently of a.a. 4– <dig>  finally, ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig> can form heterodimers, and we show that the interaction with ctbp <dig> is one mechanism whereby ctbp <dig> can be recruited to the nucleus.


CONCLUSIONS
together, these findings represent key distinctions in the regulation of the functions of ctbp family members that may have important implications as to their roles in development, and cell differentiation and survival.
