BACKGROUND
the pathological condition of canine prostate cancer resembles that of human androgen-independent prostate cancer. both canine and human androgen receptor  signalling are inhibited by overexpression of the dimerized co-chaperone small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein α , which is considered to cause the development of androgen-independency. reduced expression in immortalised cells  interferes with sgta dimerization and rescues ar signalling. this study aimed to assess the effects of reic/dkk- <dig> and sgta interactions on ar signalling in the canine androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line chp- <dig> 


RESULTS
mammalian two-hybrid and halo-tagged pull-down assays showed that canine reic/dkk- <dig> interacted with sgta and interfered with sgta dimerization. additionally, reporter assays revealed that canine reic/dkk- <dig> restored ar signalling in both human and canine androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. therefore, we confirmed the interaction between canine sgta and reic/dkk- <dig>  as well as their role in ar signalling.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that this interaction might contribute to the development of a novel strategy for androgen-independent prostate cancer treatment. moreover, we established the canine androgen-independent prostate cancer model as a suitable animal model for the study of this type of treatment-refractory human cancer.
