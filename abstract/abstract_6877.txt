BACKGROUND
the use of tissue microarrays  and advances in digital scanning microscopy has enabled the collection of thousands of tissue images. there is a need for software tools to annotate, query and share this data amongst researchers in different physical locations.


RESULTS
we have developed an open source web-based application for remote scoring of tma images, which exploits the value of microsoft silverlight deep zoom to provide a intuitive interface for zooming and panning around digital images. we use and extend existing xml-based standards to ensure that the data collected can be archived and that our system is interoperable with other standards-compliant systems.


CONCLUSIONS
the application has been used for multi-centre scoring of tma slides composed of tissues from several phase iii breast cancer trials and ten different studies participating in the international breast cancer association consortium . the system has enabled researchers to simultaneously score large collections of tma and export the standardised data to integrate with pathological and clinical outcome data, thereby facilitating biomarker discovery.
