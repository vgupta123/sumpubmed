BACKGROUND
cytomegalovirus seropositivity is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis in patients with esrd. donor cmv seropositivity is associated with higher graft loss. dendritic cells, macrophages and th <dig> lymphocytes are defined as producers of il- <dig>  il- <dig> is thought to be involved in the promotion of th <dig> cell polarization. latent cmv-induced th <dig> might be involved in the pathogenesis of cmv infection in patients with esrd. we aimed to evaluate associations of th17-dependent cytokines with esrd, cmv status and post-transplant outcome in kidney transplantation.


RESULTS
il- <dig> plasma levels were similar in patients and healthy controls , whereas il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  levels were significantly higher in esrd patients. cmv-seronegative  and –seropositive  patients had significantly higher il- <dig> plasma levels than controls. cmv-seropositive patients showed excessively higher il- <dig>  plasma levels than cmv-seronegative patients. patients with post-transplant cmv reactivation had higher il- <dig> plasma levels than patients without cmv reactivation .


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that latent cmv induces il- <dig>  il- <dig> might be an inflammatory mediator of latent cmv infection in patients with esrd and predisposes patients for post-transplant cmv reactivation.
