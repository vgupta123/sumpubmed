BACKGROUND
the human brain is frequently exposed to individual faces across a wide range of different apparent sizes, often seen simultaneously . here we used a sensitive and objective fast periodic visual stimulation approach while recording scalp electroencephalogram  to test the effect of size variation on neural responses reflecting individual face discrimination.

methods
eeg was recorded in ten observers presented with the same face identity at a fixed rate  and different oddball face identities appearing every five faces . stimulus size was either constant  or changed randomly at each stimulation cycle, by 2: <dig> ratio increasing values from 10% to 80% size variation in four conditions. absolute stimulus size remained constant across conditions.


RESULTS
the base rate  <dig>  hz eeg response increased with image size variation, particularly over the right occipito-temporal cortex. in contrast, size variation decreased the oddball response marking individual face discrimination over the right occipito-temporal cortex. at constant stimulus size, the f/ <dig> change of identity generated an early  oddball response reflecting individual face discrimination based on image-based cues. this early component disappeared with a relatively small size variation , leaving a robust high-level index of individual face discrimination.


CONCLUSIONS
stimulus size variation is an important manipulation to isolate the contribution of high-level visual processes to individual face discrimination. nevertheless, even for relatively small stimuli, high-level individual face discrimination processes in the right occipito-temporal cortex remain sensitive to stimulus size variation.
