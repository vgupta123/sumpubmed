BACKGROUND
the publication of the first draft chicken sequence assembly became available in  <dig> and was updated in  <dig>  however, this does not constitute a definitive and complete sequence of the chicken genome, since the microchromosomes are notably under-represented. in an effort to develop maps for the microchromosomes absent from the chicken genome assembly, we developed radiation hybrid  and genetic maps with markers isolated from sequence currently assigned to "chromosome unknown" . the chrun is composed of sequence contigs not assigned to named chromosomes. to identify and map sequence belonging to the microchromosomes we used a comparative mapping strategy, and we focused on the small linkage group e26c <dig> 


RESULTS
in total,  <dig> markers were analysed with the chickrh <dig> panel, of which  <dig> were effectively assigned to the e26c <dig> linkage group, the remainder mapping elsewhere in the genome. the final rh map is composed of  <dig> framework markers extending over a  <dig>  cr distance. a corresponding genetic map was developed, whose length is  <dig> cm in the east lansing reference population. the e26c <dig> group was assigned to gga <dig>  by fish  mapping.


CONCLUSIONS
the high-resolution rh framework map obtained here covers the entire chicken chromosome  <dig> and reveals the existence of a high number of intrachromosomal rearrangements when compared to the human genome. the strategy used here for the characterization of gga <dig> could be used to improve knowledge on the other uncharacterized small, yet gene-rich microchromosomes.
