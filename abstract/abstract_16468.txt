BACKGROUND
cj9-gd is a novel dominant-negative recombinant herpes simplex virus type  <dig>  that is completely replication-defective, cannot establish detectable latent infection in vivo, and expresses high levels of the major hsv- <dig> antigen glycoprotein d immediately following infection. in the present study, cj9-gd was evaluated as a vaccine against hsv- <dig> genital infection in guinea pigs.


RESULTS
animals immunized with cj9-gd developed at least 700-fold higher titers of hsv-2-specific neutralization antibodies than mock-immunized controls. after challenge with wild-type hsv- <dig>  all  <dig> control guinea pigs developed multiple genital lesions with an average of  <dig> lesions per animal. in contrast, only  <dig> minor lesions were found in  <dig> of  <dig> cj9-gd-immunized animals, representing a 40-fold reduction on the incidence of primary genital lesions in immunized animals . immunization significantly reduced the amount and duration of viral shedding and provided complete protection against neurological symptoms, while 90% of mock-immunized animals succumbed due to the severity of disease. importantly, immunized animals showed no signs of recurrent disease or viral shedding during a 60-days observation period after recovery from primary infection, and carried 50-fold less latent viral dna load in their dorsal root ganglia than the surviving mock-vaccinated controls .


CONCLUSIONS
collectively, we demonstrate that vaccination with the hsv- <dig> recombinant cj9-gd elicits strong and protective immune responses against primary and recurrent hsv- <dig> genital disease and significantly reduces the extent of latent infection.
