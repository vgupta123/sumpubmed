BACKGROUND
koumiss is a traditionally fermented mare’s milk described with health-promoting potentials for decades. however, only a few studies focused on the probiotic strains isolated from koumiss. in this study, we collected koumiss samples from inner mongolian pasturing area of china and selected a promising strain of lactobacillus helveticus, isolate ns <dig>  based on the survival abilities in gastrointestinal tract  and adhesion to intestinal endothelial cells in vitro. as the ability to positively modulate host immune response is a feature of increasing importance in measuring the probiotic potential of a bacterial strain, our study mainly focus on the immunomodulatory properties of l. helveticus ns <dig> by using in vivo and ex vivo analyses.


RESULTS
l. helveticus ns <dig> was identified by molecular-typing methods, both at genus and species levels. as a typical food niche-specific bacteria, ns <dig> showed a moderate survival ability in git environment in vitro. however, an excellent binding capacity to the human intestinal epithelial cells, along with significant autoaggregation and cell-surface hydrophobicity was observed. additionally, the presence of s-layer protein was responsible for the cell surface properties of this strain. ns <dig> was found to be rather protective against tnbs -induced murine colitis. in the meantime, co-culture with ns <dig> induced an increased level of secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> in peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells . furthermore, ns <dig> was also able to diminish the proinflammatory effects of lipopolysaccharide  in mouse macrophage cell line raw <dig>  by inducing higher levels of il- <dig>  specially, adding of the purified s-layer protein didn’t influence the production of il- <dig>  the specific ligand-host receptor interactions on the ns <dig> specific immune responses need to be learned further.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, l. helveticus ns <dig> exhibited good probiotic and particularly immunomodulatory properties, with a potential for development of functional food commercially or therapeutic adjuvant for inflammatory diseases.
