BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  is characterized by severe reproductive failure and severe pneumonia in neonatal pigs and is caused by prrs virus . glycoprotein  <dig>  from prrsv is a key inducer of neutralizing antibodies. flagellin, a toll-like receptor  <dig>  agonist, is an effective inducer of innate immune responses. this study presents a novel prrsv vaccine candidate based on the adjuvant effect of salmonella typhimurium fljb fused with prrsv gp <dig> 


RESULTS
a truncated rgp <dig> gene lacking the signal peptide and transmembrane sequences was amplified and inserted into prokaryotic expression vectors, pcoldi or pgex-6p- <dig>  salmonella typhimurium flagellin fljb was amplified and inserted into the plasmid pcold-rgp <dig>  generating recombinant plasmid pcold-rgp5-fljb. histidine -tagged rgp <dig> and fusion protein rgp5-fljb were induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, verified by sds-page and western blotting, and purified via ni-nta affinity columns. the tlr-5-specific bioactivity of fusion protein rgp5-fljb was determined by detecting the expression levels of the cytokine il- <dig> in hek293-mtlr <dig> cells by sandwich elisa. the purified endotoxin-free proteins were administered intraperitoneally in a c3h/hej mouse model. the results show that immunization with the fusion protein rgp5-fljb induced a significantly enhanced gp5-specific and prrsv-specific igg response that persisted for almost 5 weeks. co-administration of the rgp <dig> with r <dig> or alum also yielded a higher igg response than administration of rgp <dig> alone. the igg1/igg2a ratio in the rgp5-fljb immunization group was significantly higher  than that in the rgp <dig> alone group and was equivalent to the response in the rgp5 + alum immunization group, suggesting a strong th <dig> immune response was induced by the fusion protein.


CONCLUSIONS
purified fusion protein rgp5-fljb is capable of activating the innate immune response, as demonstrated by the results of our tlr-5-specific bioactivity assay, and fljb has adjuvant activity, as shown by the results from our administration of rgp5-fljb in a mouse model. our findings confirm that fljb could serve as an excellent adjuvant for the production of gp5-specific and prrsv-specific igg antibodies as part of an induction of a robust humoral immune response.
