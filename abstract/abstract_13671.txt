BACKGROUND
gene regulation networks are made of recurring regulatory patterns, called network motifs. one of the most common network motifs is negative auto-regulation, in which a transcription factor represses its own production. negative auto-regulation has several potential functions: it can shorten the response time , stabilize expression against noise, and linearize the gene's input-output response curve. this latter function of negative auto-regulation, which increases the range of input signals over which downstream genes respond, has been studied by theory and synthetic gene circuits. here we ask whether negative auto-regulation preserves this function also in the context of a natural system, where it is embedded within many additional interactions. to address this, we studied the negative auto-regulation motif in the arabinose utilization system of escherichia coli, in which negative auto-regulation is part of a complex regulatory network.


RESULTS
we find that when negative auto-regulation is disrupted by placing the regulator arac under constitutive expression, the input dynamic range of the arabinose system is reduced by 10-fold. the apparent hill coefficient of the induction curve changes from about n =  <dig> with negative auto-regulation, to about n =  <dig> when it is disrupted. we present a mathematical model that describes how negative auto-regulation can increase input dynamic-range, by coupling the transcription factor protein level to the input signal.


CONCLUSIONS
here we demonstrate that the negative auto-regulation motif in the native arabinose system of escherichia coli increases the range of arabinose signals over which the system can respond. in this way, negative auto-regulation may help to increase the input dynamic-range while maintaining the specificity of cooperative regulatory systems. this function may contribute to explaining the common occurrence of negative auto-regulation in biological systems.
