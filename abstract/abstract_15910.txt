BACKGROUND
viral agents associated with reproductive failure such as aujeszky’s disease virus , encephalomyocarditis virus , and porcine parvovirus  have also been identified in european wild boar. to screen for the presence of antibodies against adv, emcv, and ppv from wild boar  in south korea,  <dig> serum samples were collected from wild boar hunted between december  <dig> and may  <dig> 


RESULTS
of the  <dig> serum samples tested,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were seropositive for adv and emcv antibodies, respectively, based on a neutralization test , and  <dig>  were seropositive for ppv antibodies based on a hemagglutination inhibition  test.


CONCLUSIONS
this was the first survey to identify the seroprevalence of the three major viruses associated with reproductive failure in the wild boar population of south korea. wild boar may act as a reservoir for many viruses that cause infectious diseases in domestic pigs. thus, strict prevention and control measures, such as continuous wildlife disease surveillance and strategic methods of downsizing the population density, should be implemented to prevent disease transmission from wild boar to domestic pigs.
