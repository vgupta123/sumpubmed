BACKGROUND
the transcription factor stat <dig>  is frequently activated in tumor cells. activated stat <dig> forms homodimers, or heterodimers with other tfs such as nf-κb, which becomes activated. cytoplasmic stat <dig> dimers are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation; they interact with importins via a nuclear localization signal  one of which is located within the dna-binding domain formed by the dimer. in the nucleus, stat <dig> regulates target gene expression by binding a consensus sequence within the promoter. stat3-specific decoy oligonucleotides  that contain this consensus sequence inhibit the transcriptional activity of stat <dig>  leading to cell death; however, their mechanism of action is unclear.


RESULTS
the mechanism of action of a stat3-decoy odn was analyzed in the colon carcinoma cell line sw  <dig>  these cells' dependence on activated stat <dig> was verified by showing that cell death is induced by stat3-specific sirnas or stattic. stat3-decoy odn was shown to bind activated stat <dig> within the cytoplasm, and to prevent its translocation to the nucleus, as well as that of stat3-associated nf-κb, but it did not prevent the nuclear transfer of stat <dig> with mutations in its dna-binding domain. the complex formed by stat <dig> and the stat3-decoy odn did not associate with importin, while stat <dig> alone was found to co-immunoprecipitate with importin. leptomycin b and vanadate both trap stat <dig> in the nucleus. they were found here to oppose the cytoplasmic trapping of stat <dig> by the stat3-decoy odn. control decoys consisting of either a mutated stat3-decoy odn or a nf-κb-specific decoy odn had no effect on stat <dig> nuclear translocation. finally, blockage of stat <dig> nuclear transfer correlated with the induction of sw  <dig> cell death.


CONCLUSIONS
the inhibition of stat <dig> by a stat3-decoy odn, leading to cell death, involves the entrapment of activated stat <dig> dimers in the cytoplasm. a mechanism is suggested whereby this entrapment is due to stat3-decoy odn's inhibition of active stat3/importin interaction. these observations point to the high potential of stat3-decoy odn as a reagent and to stat <dig> nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling in tumor cells as a potential target for effective anti-cancer compounds.
