BACKGROUND
cd <dig> is a multiligand receptor involved in various metabolic pathways, including cellular uptake of long-chain fatty acids. defect function or expression of cd <dig> can result in dyslipidemia or insulin resistance. we have previously shown that cd <dig> expression is female-predominant in rat liver. in the present study, hormonal and nutritional regulation of hepatic cd <dig> expression was examined in male and female rats. since alternative transcription start sites have been described in murine and human cd <dig>  we investigated whether alternative cd <dig> transcripts are differentially regulated in rat liver during these conditions.


RESULTS
sequence information of the rat cd <dig> 5'-utr was extended, showing that the gene structure of cd <dig> in rat is similar to that previously described in mouse with at least two alternative first exons. the rat cd <dig> exon 1a promoter was sequenced and found to be highly similar to murine and human cd <dig>  we show that alternative first exon usage is involved in the female-predominant expression of cd <dig> in rat liver and during certain hormonal states that induce cd <dig> mrna abundance. estrogen treatment or continuous infusion of growth hormone  in male rats induced cd <dig> expression preferentially through the exon 1a promoter. old age was associated with increased cd <dig> expression in male rats, albeit without any preferential first exon usage. intermittent gh treatment in old male rats reversed this effect. mild starvation  reduced cd <dig> expression in female liver, whereas its expression was increased in skeletal muscle.


CONCLUSIONS
the results obtained in this study confirm and extend our previous observation that gh is an important regulator of hepatic cd <dig>  and depending on the mode of treatment  the gene might be either induced or repressed. we suggest that the effects of continuous gh secretion in females  and intermittent gh secretion in males  explains the sex-different expression of this gene. furthermore, a female-specific repression of hepatic cd <dig> in response to food deprivation was found, which was in contrast to a stimulatory effect in skeletal muscle. this demonstrates a tissue-specific regulation of cd <dig>
