BACKGROUND
mutations in the otopetrin  <dig> gene  in mice and fish produce an unusual bilateral vestibular pathology that involves the absence of otoconia without hearing impairment. the encoded protein, otop <dig>  is the only functionally characterized member of the otopetrin domain protein  family; the extended sequence and structural preservation of odp proteins in metazoans suggest a conserved functional role. here, we use the tools of sequence- and cytogenetic-based comparative genomics to study the otop <dig> and the otop2-otop <dig> genes and to establish their genomic context in  <dig> vertebrates. we extend our evolutionary study to include the gene mutated in usher syndrome  subtype 1g , both because of the head-to-tail clustering of ush1g with otop <dig> and because otop <dig> and ush1g mutations result in inner ear phenotypes.


RESULTS
we established that otop <dig> is the boundary gene of an inversion polymorphism on human chromosome 4p <dig> that originated in the common human-chimpanzee lineage more than  <dig> million years ago. other lineage-specific evolutionary events included a three-fold expansion of the otop genes in xenopus tropicalis and of ush1g in teleostei fish. the tight physical linkage between otop <dig> and ush1g is conserved in all vertebrates. to further understand the functional organization of the ushg1-otop <dig> locus, we deduced a putative map of binding sites for ccctc-binding factor , a mammalian insulator transcription factor, from genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing  data in mouse and human embryonic stem  cells combined with detection of ctcf-binding motifs.


CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here clarify the evolutionary history of the vertebrate otop and ush1g families, and establish a framework for studying the possible interaction of ush1g and otop in developmental pathways.
