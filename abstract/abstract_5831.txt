BACKGROUND
the genetic basis of susceptibility to renal tumorigenesis has not yet been established in mouse strains. mouse lines derived by bidirectional phenotypic selection on the basis of their maximal  or minimal  acute inflammatory responsiveness differ widely in susceptibility to spontaneous and urethane-induced renal tumorigenesis. to map the functional loci modulating renal tumor susceptibility in these mice, we carried out a genome-wide genetic linkage study, using snp arrays, in an f <dig> intercross population treated with a single urethane dose at 1 week of age and phenotyped for renal tumors at 35 weeks of age.


RESULTS
airmax mice did not develop renal tumors spontaneously nor in response to urethane, whereas in airmin mice renal tumors formed spontaneously  and after urethane induction . the tumors had a papillary morphology and were positive for alpha-methylacyl-coa racemase and negative for cd <dig>  by analysis of  <dig> informative snps in  <dig> mice, we mapped a single quantitative trait locus modulating the incidence of renal tumors in the f <dig> intercross population. this locus, which we named renal tumor modifier qtl  <dig> , mapped to chromosome  <dig> at  <dig>  mb , with snps rs <dig> and rs <dig> flanking the lod score peak. the a allele of rs <dig> from airmin mice was associated with a  <dig> -fold increased odds ratio for renal tumor development. the lod score peak included the tuberous sclerosis  <dig>  gene which has already been implicated in kidney disease: loss of function by germline retroviral insertion is associated with spontaneous renal tumorigenesis in the eker rat, and heterozygous-null tsc <dig> mice develop renal cystadenomas.


CONCLUSIONS
we mapped rtm <dig> as a single major locus modulating renal tumorigenesis in a murine intercross population. thus, the air mouse lines can be considered a new genetic model for studying the role of germline and somatic molecular alterations in kidney neoplastic disease.
