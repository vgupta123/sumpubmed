BACKGROUND
prolyl oligopeptidases  are proteolytic enzymes, widely distributed in all the kingdoms of life. bacterial pops are pharmaceutically important enzymes, yet their functional and evolutionary details are not fully explored. therefore, current analysis is aimed at understanding the distribution, domain architecture, probable biological functions and gene family expansion of pops in bacterial and archaeal lineages.


RESULTS
exhaustive sequence analysis of  <dig>  bacterial and  <dig> archaeal genomes revealed ~ <dig>  pop homologs, with only  <dig> annotated pops. we observed wide distribution of pops in all the analysed bacterial lineages. phylogenetic analysis and co-clustering of pops of different phyla suggested their common functions in all the prokaryotic species. further, on the basis of unique sequence motifs we could classify bacterial pops into eight subtypes. analysis of coexisting domains in pops highlighted their involvement in protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling. we proposed significant extension of this gene family by characterizing  <dig> new pops and  <dig> new α/β hydrolase members.


CONCLUSIONS
our study reflects diversity and functional importance of pops in bacterial species. many genomes with multiple pops were identified with high sequence variations and different cellular localizations. such anomalous distribution of pop genes in different bacterial genomes shows differential expansion of pop gene family primarily by multiple horizontal gene transfer events.
