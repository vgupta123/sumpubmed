BACKGROUND
the detection of conserved motifs in promoters of orthologous genes  has become a common strategy to predict cis-acting regulatory elements. several software tools are routinely used to raise hypotheses about regulation. however, these tools are generally used as black boxes, with default parameters. a systematic evaluation of optimal parameters for a footprint discovery strategy can bring a sizeable improvement to the predictions.


RESULTS
we evaluate the performances of a footprint discovery approach based on the detection of over-represented spaced motifs. this method is particularly suitable for  bacteria, since such motifs are typically bound by factors containing a helix-turn-helix domain. we evaluated footprint discovery in  <dig> escherichia coli k <dig> genes with annotated sites, under  <dig> different combinations of parameters . motifs are assessed both at the levels of correctness and significance. we further report a detailed analysis of  <dig> bacterial orthologs of the lexa repressor. distinct motifs are detected at various taxonomical levels, including the  <dig> previously characterized taxon-specific motifs. in addition, we highlight a significantly stronger conservation of half-motifs in actinobacteria, relative to firmicutes, suggesting an intermediate state in specificity switching between the two gram-positive phyla, and thereby revealing the on-going evolution of lexa auto-regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
the footprint discovery method proposed here shows excellent results with e. coli and can readily be extended to predict cis-acting regulatory signals and propose testable hypotheses in bacterial genomes for which nothing is known about regulation.
