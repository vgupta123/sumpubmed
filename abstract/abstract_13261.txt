BACKGROUND
unlike in abscission or dehiscence, fruit of kiwifruit actinidia eriantha develop the ability for peel detachment when they are ripe and soft in the absence of a morphologically identifiable abscission zone. two closely-related genotypes with contrasting detachment behaviour have been identified. the ‘good-peeling’ genotype has detachment with clean debonding of cells, and a peel tissue that does not tear. the ‘poor-peeling’ genotype has poor detachability, with cells that rupture upon debonding, and peel tissue that fragments easily.


RESULTS
structural studies indicated that peel detachability in both genotypes occurred in the outer pericarp beneath the hypodermis. immunolabelling showed differences in methylesterification of pectin, where the interface of labelling coincided with the location of detachment in the good-peeling genotype, whereas in the poor-peeling genotype, no such interface existed. this zone of difference in methylesterification was enhanced by differential cell wall changes between the peel and outer pericarp tissue. although both genotypes expressed two polygalacturonase genes, no enzyme activity was detected in the good-peeling genotype, suggesting limited pectin breakdown, keeping cell walls strong without tearing or fragmentation of the peel and flesh upon detachment. differences in location and amounts of wall-stiffening galactan in the peel of the good-peeling genotype possibly contributed to this phenotype. hemicellulose-acting transglycosylases were more active in the good-peeling genotype, suggesting an influence on peel flexibility by remodelling their substrates during development of detachability. high xyloglucanase activity in the peel of the good-peeling genotype may contribute by having a strengthening effect on the cellulose-xyloglucan network.


CONCLUSIONS
in fruit of a. eriantha, peel detachability is due to the establishment of a zone of discontinuity created by differential cell wall changes in peel and outer pericarp tissues that lead to changes in mechanical properties of the peel. during ripening, the peel becomes flexible and the cells continue to adhere strongly to each other, preventing breakage, whereas the underlying outer pericarp loses cell wall strength as softening proceeds. together these results reveal a novel and interesting mechanism for enabling cell separation.
