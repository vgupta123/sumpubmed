BACKGROUND
bacteria of the class mollicutes underwent extreme reduction of genomes and gene expression control systems. only a few regulators are known to date. in this work, we describe a novel group of transcriptional regulators that are distributed within different mollicutes and control the expression of restriction-modification systems .


RESULTS
we performed cross-species search of putative regulators of rm-systems  and respective binding sites in mollicutes. we identified a set of novel putative c-protein binding motifs distributed within mollicutes. we studied the most frequent motif and respective c-protein on the model of mycoplasma gallisepticum s <dig>  we confirmed our prediction and identified key nucleotides important for c-protein binding. further we identified novel target promoters of c-protein in m. gallisepticum.


CONCLUSIONS
we found that c-protein of m. gallisepticum binds predicted conserved direct repeats of the  <dig> motif. apart from its own operon promoter, hsdc can bind to the promoters of the clpb chaperone gene and a trna cluster.
