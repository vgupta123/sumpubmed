BACKGROUND
aluminum  toxicity is an important factor limiting crop production on acid soils. however, little is known about the mechanisms by which legumes respond to and resist al stress. to explore the mechanisms of al toxicity and resistance in legumes, we compared the impact of al stress in al-resistant and al-sensitive lines of the model legume, medicago truncatula gaertn.


RESULTS
a screen for al resistance in  <dig> m. truncatula accessions identified eight al-resistant and eight al-sensitive lines. comparisons of hydroponic root growth and root tip hematoxylin staining in an al-resistant line, t <dig>  and an al-sensitive line, s <dig>  provided evidence that an inducible al exclusion mechanism occurs in t <dig>  transcriptional events associated with the al resistance response were analyzed in t <dig> and s <dig> after  <dig> and  <dig> h al treatment using oligonucleotide microarrays. fewer genes were differentially regulated in response to al in t <dig> compared to s <dig>  expression patterns of oxidative stress-related genes, stress-response genes and microscopic examination of al-treated root tips suggested a lower degree of al-induced oxidative damage to t <dig> root tips compared to s <dig>  furthermore, genes associated with cell death, senescence, and cell wall degradation were induced in both lines after  <dig> h of al treatment but preferentially in s <dig> after  <dig> h of al treatment. a multidrug and toxin efflux  transporter, previously shown to exude citrate in arabidopsis, showed differential expression patterns in t <dig> and s <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results identified novel genes induced by al in al-resistant and sensitive m. truncatula lines. in t <dig>  transcription levels of genes related to oxidative stress were consistent with reactive oxygen species production, which would be sufficient to initiate cell death of al-accumulating cells thereby contributing to al exclusion and root growth recovery. in contrast, transcriptional levels of oxidative stress-related genes were consistent with excessive reactive oxygen species accumulation in s <dig> potentially resulting in necrosis and irreversible root growth inhibition. in addition, a citrate-exuding mate transporter could function in al exclusion and/or internal detoxification in t <dig> based on al-induced transcript localization studies. together, our findings indicate that multiple responses likely contribute to al resistance in m. truncatula.
