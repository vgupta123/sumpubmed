BACKGROUND
hla genotyping by next generation sequencing  requires three basic steps, pcr, ngs, and allele assignment. compared to the conventional methods, such as pcr-sequence specific oligonucleotide primers  and -sequence based typing , pcr-ngs is extremely labor intensive and time consuming. in order to simplify and accelerate the ngs-based hla genotyping method for multiple dna samples, we developed and evaluated four multiplex pcr methods for genotyping up to nine classical hla loci including hla-a, hla-b, hla-c, hla-drb1/3/4/ <dig>  hla-dqb <dig>  and hla-dpb <dig> 


RESULTS
we developed multiplex pcr methods using newly and previously designed middle ranged pcr primer sets for genotyping different combinations of hla loci,  hla-drb1/3/4/ <dig>   hla-dqb <dig> ,  hla-a, hla-b, hla-c, and  hla-dpb <dig> . the primer sets were designed to genotype polymorphic exons to the field  <dig> level or 6-digit typing. when we evaluated the pcr method for genotyping all nine hla loci  using  <dig> japanese reference subjects who represented a distribution of more than  <dig> % of the hla alleles at each of the nine hla loci, all of the  <dig> alleles genotyped, except for hla-drb3/4/ <dig> alleles, were consistent with known alleles assigned by the conventional methods together with relevant locus balance and no excessive allelic imbalance. one multiplex pcr method  was able to provide precise genotyping data even when only 1 ng of genomic dna was used for the pcr as a sample template.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have demonstrated that the multiplex pcr approach for ngs-based hla genotyping could serve as an alternative routine hla genotyping method, possibly replacing the conventional methods by providing an accelerated yet robust amplification step. the method also could provide significant merits for clinical applications with its ability to amplify lower quantity of samples and the cost-saving factors.
