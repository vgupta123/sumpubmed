BACKGROUND
the akita mutation  in the insulin gene results in early onset diabetes in both humans and mice. expression of mutant proinsulin  causes endoplasmic reticulum  stress in pancreatic β-cells and consequently the cell activates the unfolded protein response . since the proinsulin is terminally misfolded er stress is irremediable and chronic activation of the upr eventually activates apoptosis in some cells. here we analyzed the ire1-dependent activation of genes in response to misfolded proinsulin production in an inducible mutant proinsulin  insulinoma cell line.


RESULTS
the ire <dig> endoribonuclease inhibitors 4μ8c and mkc- <dig> prevented the splicing of the xbp <dig> mrna in response to er stress caused by mutant proinsulin production. microarray expression analysis and qpcr validation of select genes revealed that maximal upregulation of many upr genes in response to mutant proinsulin production required ire <dig>  although most were still increased above control. interestingly, neither degradation of misfolded proinsulin via er-associated degradation , nor apoptosis induced by prolonged misfolded proinsulin expression were affected by inhibiting ire <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
although maximal induction of most upr genes requires ire <dig>  inhibition of ire <dig> does not affect erad of misfolded proinsulin or predispose pancreatic β-cells expressing misfolded proinsulin to chronic er stress-induced apoptosis.
