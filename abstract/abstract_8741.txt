BACKGROUND
bacteria of the genus arthrobacter are ubiquitous in soil environments and can be considered as true survivalists. arthrobacter sp. strain rue61a is an isolate from sewage sludge able to utilize quinaldine  as sole carbon and energy source. the genome provides insight into the molecular basis of the versatility and robustness of this environmental arthrobacter strain.


RESULTS
the genome of arthrobacter sp. rue61a consists of a single circular chromosome of  <dig> ,495â€‰bp with an average g + c content of  <dig> %, the circular  <dig> -bp plasmid parue <dig>  and the linear  <dig> -bp plasmid parue <dig> that was already published. plasmid parue <dig> is proposed to contribute to the resistance of arthrobacter sp. rue61a to arsenate and pb2+, whereas the linear plasmid confers the ability to convert quinaldine to anthranilate. remarkably, degradation of anthranilate exclusively proceeds via a coa-thioester pathway. apart from quinaldine utilization, strain rue61a has a limited set of aromatic degradation pathways, enabling the utilization of 4-hydroxy-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids, which are characteristic products of lignin depolymerization, via ortho cleavage of protocatechuate. however, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate degradation likely proceeds via meta cleavage of homoprotocatechuate. the genome of strain rue61a contains numerous genes associated with osmoprotection, and a high number of genes coding for transporters. it encodes a broad spectrum of enzymes for the uptake and utilization of various sugars and organic nitrogen compounds. a. aurescens tc- <dig> is the closest sequenced relative of strain rue61a.


CONCLUSIONS
the genome of arthrobacter sp. rue61a reflects the saprophytic lifestyle and nutritional versatility of the organism and a strong adaptive potential to environmental stress. the circular plasmid parue <dig> and the linear plasmid parue <dig> contribute to heavy metal resistance and to the ability to degrade quinaldine, respectively.
