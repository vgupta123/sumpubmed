BACKGROUND
the set 3- <dig>  enhancer-of-zeste, trithorax) domain is an evolutionarily conserved sequence of approximately 130- <dig> amino acids, and constitutes the catalytic site of lysine methyltransferases . kmts perform many crucial biological functions via histone methylation of chromatin. histone methylation marks are interpreted differently depending on the histone type , the lysine position  and the number of added methyl groups . for example, h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> are associated with transcriptional activation, but h3k9me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> are associated with gene silencing. the substrate specificity and activity of kmts are determined by sequences within the set domain and other regions of the protein.


RESULTS
here we identified  <dig> set-domain proteins from the recently sequenced brassica rapa genome. we performed sequence similarity and protein domain organization analysis of these proteins, along with the set-domain proteins from the dicot arabidopsis thaliana, the monocots oryza sativa and brachypodium distachyon, and the green alga ostreococcus tauri. we showed that plant set-domain proteins can be grouped into  <dig> distinct classes, namely kmt <dig>  kmt <dig>  kmt <dig>  kmt <dig>  kmt <dig> and s-et. apart from the s-et class, which has an interrupted set domain and may be involved in methylation of nonhistone proteins, the other classes have characteristics of histone methyltransferases exhibiting different substrate specificities: kmt <dig> for h3k <dig>  kmt <dig> for h3k <dig>  kmt <dig> for h3k <dig>  kmt <dig> for h3k <dig> and kmt <dig> also for h3k <dig>  we also propose a coherent and rational nomenclature for plant set-domain proteins. comparisons of sequence similarity and synteny of b. rapa and a. thaliana set-domain proteins revealed recent gene duplication events for some kmts.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides the first characterization of the set-domain kmt proteins of b. rapa. phylogenetic analysis data allowed the development of a coherent and rational nomenclature of this important family of proteins in plants, as in animals. the results obtained in this study will provide a base for nomenclature of kmts in other plant species and facilitate the functional characterization of these important epigenetic regulatory genes in brassica crops.
