BACKGROUND
the peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase  parvulin  is highly conserved in all metazoans and is assumed to play a role in cell cycle progression and chromatin remodeling. it is predominantly localized to the nucleus and binds to chromosomal dna as well as bent oligonucleotides in vitro.


RESULTS
in this study we confirm by rt-pcr the existence of a longer parvulin isoform expressed in all tissues examined so far. this isoform contains a 5' extension including a  <dig> bp extended open reading frame with two coupled snps leading to amino acid substitutions q16r and r18s. about 1% of all parvulin mrnas include the novel extension as quantified by real-time pcr. the human parvulin promoter is tata-less and situated in a cpg island typical for house keeping genes. thus, different parvulin mrnas seem to arise by alternative transcription initiation. n-terminally extended parvulin is protected from rapid proteinasek degradation. in hela and hepg <dig> cell lysates two protein species of about  <dig> and  <dig> kda are detected by an antibody against an epitope within the n-terminal extension. these two bands are also recognized by an antibody towards the ppiase domain of parvulin. the longer parvulin protein is encoded by the human genome but absent from rodent, bovine and non-mammalian genomes.


CONCLUSIONS
due to its molecular weight of  <dig>  kda we denote the novel parvulin isoform as par <dig> following the e. coli par <dig> and human par <dig> nomenclature. the n-terminal elongation of par17-qr and par17-rs suggests these isoforms to perform divergent functions within the eukaryotic cell than the well characterized par <dig>
