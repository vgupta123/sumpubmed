BACKGROUND
zfra is a 31-amino-acid zinc finger-like protein, which is known to regulate cell death by tumor necrosis factor  and overexpressed tnf receptor- or fas-associated death domain proteins . in addition, zfra undergoes self-association and interacts with c-jun n-terminal kinase  <dig>  in response to stress stimuli. to further delineate the functional properties of zfra, here we investigated zfra regulation of the activation of p <dig>  wox <dig> , nf-κb, and jnk <dig> under apoptotic stress.


RESULTS
transiently overexpressed zfra caused growth suppression and apoptotic death of many but not all types of cells. zfra either enhanced or blocked cell death caused by tradd, fadd, or receptor-interacting protein  in a dose-related manner. this modulation is related with zfra binding with tradd, nf-κb, jnk <dig> and wox <dig>  as determined by gst pull-down analysis, co-immunoprecipitation, and mapping by yeast two-hybrid analysis. functionally, transiently overexpressed zfra sequestered nf-κb , wox <dig>  p <dig> and phospho-erk  in the cytoplasm, and tnf or uv light could not effectively induce nuclear translocation of these proteins. zfra counteracted the apoptotic functions of tyr33-phosphorylated wox <dig> and ser46-phosphorylated p <dig>  alteration of ser <dig> to gly abolished the apoptotic function of zfra and its regulation of wox <dig> and p <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
in response to tnf, zfra is upregulated and modulates tnf-mediated cell death via interacting with tradd, fadd and rip  at the receptor level, and downstream effectors nf-κb, p <dig>  wox <dig>  and jnk <dig>
