BACKGROUND
based on their function in cancer micrornas are often grouped as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes. however, mirnas regulate multiple tumor relevant signaling pathways raising the question whether two oncogenic mirnas could be functional antagonists by promoting different steps in tumor progression. we recently developed a method to connect mirnas to biological function by comparing mirna and gene array expression data from the nci <dig> cell lines without using mirna target predictions .


RESULTS
we have now extended this analysis to three primary human cancers  available at the cancer genome atlas , and have correlated the expression of the clustered mirnas with  <dig> oncogenic signatures . we have identified functionally antagonistic groups of mirnas. one group , which contains many of the members of the mir- <dig> family, correlated with c-myc induced genes and e2f gene signatures. a group that was directly antagonistic to the agonists in all three primary cancers contains mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  since both mir-17 ~  <dig> and mir-221/ <dig> are considered to be oncogenic this points to a functional antagonism of different oncogenic mirnas. analysis of patient data revealed that in certain patients agonistic mirnas predominated, whereas in other patients antagonists predominated. in glioblastoma a high ratio of mir- <dig> to mir-221/ <dig> was predictive of better overall survival suggesting that high mir-221/ <dig> expression is more adverse for patients than high mir- <dig> expression.


CONCLUSIONS
mirconnect  <dig>  is useful for identifying activities of mirnas that are relevant to primary cancers. the new correlation data on mirnas and mrnas deregulated in three primary cancers are available at mirconnect.org
