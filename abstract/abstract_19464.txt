BACKGROUND
porcine parvovirus  is the important causative agent for infectious infertility, which is a fairly tough virus that multiplies normally in the intestine of pigs without causing clinical signs in the world.


RESULTS
we developed an assay integrating real-time pcr and high resolution melting  analysis for the detection of ppv. primers targeting the vp gene were highly specific, as evidenced by the negative amplification of closely related viruses, such as porcine circovirus  <dig> , porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus , pseudorabies virus , classical swine fever virus , or japanese encephalitis virus . the performance of unlabeled real time pcr was compared to taqman real time pcr, and the detection limits of the two methods were nearly equal. moreover, there was good correlation between cp and diluted genomic dna when tested with the two methods. the assay has the accuracy of 100% in reference to labeled real time pcr, when it was tested on  <dig> clinical samples.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrated that the established assay integrating real-time pcr and hrm is relatively cost-effective and more stable, which provides an alternative tool for rapid, simple, specific and sensitive detection of ppv.
