BACKGROUND
micrornas  regulate gene expression by binding to mrna transcripts in various biological processes. in mammals and birds, mirnas are known to play vital parts in both host immune defense and viral infection. however, in lower vertebrates such as teleost, systematic investigations on host and viral mirnas are lacking.


RESULTS
in this study, we applied high-throughput sequencing technology to identify and analyze both host and viral mirnas in japanese flounder , an economically important teleost fish farmed widely in the world, infected with megalocytivirus at a timescale of 14 days divided into five different time points. the results showed that a total of  <dig> host mirnas and  <dig> viral mirnas were identified, the latter being all novel mirnas that have no homologues in the currently available databases. of the host mirnas,  <dig> have been reported previously in flounder and other species, and  <dig> were discovered for the first time. the expression levels of  <dig> host mirnas were significantly altered at  <dig> d to  <dig> d post-viral infection , and these mirnas were therefore classified as differentially expressed host mirnas. the expression levels of all  <dig> viral mirnas increased from  <dig> d pi to  <dig> d pi and then dropped from  <dig> d pi to  <dig> d pi. for the  <dig> differentially expressed host mirnas and the  <dig> viral mirnas,  <dig> and  <dig> putative target genes, respectively, were predicted in flounder. go and kegg enrichment analysis revealed that the putative target genes of both host and viral mirnas were grouped mainly into the categories of immune response, signal transduction, and apoptotic process.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of our study provide the first evidences that indicate existence in teleost fish  infection-responsive host and viral mirnas that exhibit dynamic changes in expression profiles during the course of viral infection, and  potential involvement of mirnas in host-viral interaction.
