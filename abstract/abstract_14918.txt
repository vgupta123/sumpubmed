BACKGROUND
the transcription factor pax <dig> is expressed during thyroid development and is involved in the morphogenesis of the thyroid gland and maintenance of the differentiated phenotype. in particular, pax <dig> has been shown to regulate genes that are considered markers of thyroid differentiation. recently, the analysis of the gene expression profile of frtl- <dig> differentiated thyroid cells after the silencing of pax <dig> identified wnt <dig> as a novel target. like the other members of the wnt family, wnt <dig> has been implicated in several developmental processes including regulation of cell fate and patterning during embryogenesis. to date, the only evidence on wnt <dig> in thyroid concerns its down-regulation necessary for the progression of thyroid epithelial tumors.


RESULTS
here we demonstrate that pax <dig> is involved in the transcriptional modulation of wnt <dig> gene expression directly binding to its 5’-flanking region, and that wnt <dig> expression in frtl- <dig> cells is tsh-dependent. interestingly, we also show that in thyroid cells a reduced expression of wnt <dig> correlates with the alteration of the epithelial phenotype and that the overexpression of wnt <dig> in thyroid cancer cells is able to inhibit cellular migration.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified and characterized a functional pax <dig> binding site in the 5’-flanking region of the wnt <dig> gene and we show that pax <dig> modulates the expression of wnt <dig> in thyroid cells. taken together, our results suggest that in thyroid cells wnt <dig> expression correlates with the integrity of the epithelial phenotype and is reduced when this integrity is perturbed. in the end, we would like to suggest that the overexpression of wnt <dig> in thyroid cancer cells is able to revert the mesenchymal phenotype.
