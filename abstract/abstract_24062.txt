BACKGROUND
we present evidence that a major aspect of the mechanism of acute signal transduction regulation by insulin-like growth factor- <dig>  in cultured murine myoblasts is associated with a broad perturbation of many components of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthetic pathways.


RESULTS
we have used microarray transcriptional analysis to examine the acute effects of igf- <dig> on global patterns of gene expression in c2c <dig> myoblasts and have identified approximately  <dig> genes that are up-regulated and  <dig> genes down-regulated from 2- to 6-fold after treatment with igf- <dig>  of the up-regulated genes,  <dig> genes are associated with cholesterol biosynthesis and  <dig> genes specify aspects of fatty acid biosynthesis. in addition  <dig> recognized transcription factors are significantly induced by igf- <dig> at  <dig> hour.


CONCLUSIONS
the srebps, important regulators of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, operate via a post-transcriptional route and no significant transcriptional induction was observed in the  <dig> hr of igf- <dig> treatment. since there are no prior reports of significant and coordinated perturbations of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthetic pathways with igf- <dig> in muscle cells, these findings provide a substantive expansion of our understanding of igf- <dig> action and the signal transduction pathways mediated by it, its variants and insulin.
