BACKGROUND
the directional migration and the following development of primordial germ cells  during gonad formation are key steps for germline development. it has been proposed that the interaction between germ cells and genital ridge  somatic cells plays essential roles in this process. however, the in vivo functional requirements of gr somatic cells in germ cell development are largely unknown.


RESULTS
wt <dig> mutation  results in gr agenesis through mitotic arrest of coelomic epitheliums. in this study, we employed the gr-deficient mouse model, wt1r394w/r394w, to investigate the roles of gr somatic cells in pgc migration and proliferation. we found that the number of pgcs was dramatically reduced in gr-deficient embryos at embryonic day   <dig>  and e <dig>  due to decreased proliferation of pgcs, involving low levels of bmp signaling. in contrast, the germ cells in wt1r394w/r394w embryos were still mitotically active at e <dig> , while all the germ cells in control embryos underwent mitotic arrest at this stage. strikingly, the directional migration of pgcs was not affected by the absence of gr somatic cells. most of the pgcs reached the mesenchyme under the coelomic epithelium at e <dig>  and no ectopic pgcs were noted in gr-deficient embryos. however, the precise positioning of pgcs was disrupted.


CONCLUSIONS
our work provides in vivo evidence that the proliferation of germ cells is precisely regulated by gr somatic cells during different stages of gonad development. gr somatic cells are probably dispensable for the directional migration of pgcs, but they are required for precise positioning of pgcs at the final step of migration.
