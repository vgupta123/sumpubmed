BACKGROUND
dna-bound transcription factors recruit an array of coregulatory proteins that influence gene expression. we previously demonstrated that dna functions as an allosteric modulator of estrogen receptor α  conformation, alters the recruitment of regulatory proteins, and influences estrogen-responsive gene expression and reasoned that it would be useful to develop a method of isolating proteins associated with the dna-bound erα using full-length receptor and endogenously-expressed nuclear proteins.


RESULTS
we have developed a novel approach to isolate large complexes of proteins associated with the dna-bound erα. purified erα and hela nuclear extracts were combined with oligos containing erα binding sites and fractionated on agarose gels. the protein-dna complexes were isolated and mass spectrometry analysis was used to identify proteins associated with the dna-bound receptor. rather than simply identifying individual proteins that interact with erα, we identified interconnected networks of proteins with a variety of enzymatic and catalytic activities that interact not only with erα, but also with each other. characterization of a number of these proteins has demonstrated that, in addition to their previously identified functions, they also influence erα activity and expression of estrogen-responsive genes.


CONCLUSIONS
the agarose gel fractionation method we have developed would be useful in identifying proteins that interact with dna-bound transcription factors and should be easily adapted for use with a variety of cultured cell lines, dna sequences, and transcription factors.
