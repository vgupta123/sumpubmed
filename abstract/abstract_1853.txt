BACKGROUND
the adaptation of the crispr-cas <dig> system to pooled library gene knockout screens in mammalian cells represents a major technological leap over rna interference, the prior state of the art. new methods for analyzing the data and evaluating results are needed.


RESULTS
we offer bagel , a supervised learning method for analyzing gene knockout screens. coupled with gold-standard reference sets of essential and nonessential genes, bagel offers significantly greater sensitivity than current methods, while computational optimizations reduce runtime by an order of magnitude.


CONCLUSIONS
using bagel, we identify ~ <dig> fitness genes in pooled library knockout screens in human cell lines at 5 % fdr, a major advance over competing platforms. bagel shows high sensitivity and specificity even across screens performed by different labs using different libraries and reagents.
