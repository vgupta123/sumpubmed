BACKGROUND
the progression of scrapie is known to be influenced by the amino acid polymorphisms of the host prion protein  gene. there is no breeding programme for tse resistance in sheep in finland, but a scrapie control programme has been in place since  <dig> 

in this study we have analysed prp genotypes of total of  <dig> purebred and crossbred sheep together with the data of scrapie survey carried out in finland during 2002– <dig> in order to gain knowledge of the genotype distribution and scrapie prevalence in finnish sheep.


RESULTS
the arq/arq genotype was the most common genotype in all breeds studied. arr allele frequency was less than 12% in purebred finnish sheep and in most genotypes heterozygous for arr, the second allele was arq. the vrq allele was not detected in the grey race sheep of kainuu or in the aland sheep, and it was present in less than 6% of the finnish landrace sheep. leucine was the most prominent amino acid found in codon  <dig>  in addition, one novel prion dimorphisms of q220l was detected. during the scrapie survey of over  <dig>  <dig> sheep in 2002– <dig>  no classical scrapie cases and only five atypical scrapie cases were detected.


CONCLUSIONS
the results indicate that the finnish sheep populations have genetically little resistance to classical scrapie, but no classical scrapie was detected during an extensive survey in 2002– <dig>  however, five atypical scrapie cases emerged; thus, the disease is present in the finnish sheep population at a low level.
