BACKGROUND
several conflict processing studies aimed to dissociate neuroimaging phenomena related to stimulus and response conflict processing. however, previous studies typically did not include a paradigm-independent measure of either stimulus or response conflict. here we have combined electro-myography  with event-related brain potentials  in order to determine whether a particularly robust marker of conflict processing, the n <dig> erp effect usually related to the activity of the anterior cingulate cortex , is related to stimulus- or to response-conflict processing. emg provided paradigm-independent measure of response conflict. in a numerical stroop paradigm participants compared pairs of digits and pressed a button on the side where they saw the larger digit. 50% of digit-pairs were preceded by an effective cue which provided accurate information about the required response. 50% of trials were preceded by a neutral cue which did not communicate the side of response.


RESULTS
emg showed that response conflict was significantly larger in neutrally than in effectively cued trials. the n <dig> was similar when response conflict was high and when it was low.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the n <dig> is related to stimulus or abstract, rather than to response conflict detection/resolution. findings may enable timing acc conflict effects.
