BACKGROUND
during the interaction between rhizobia and leguminous plants the two partners engage in a molecular conversation that leads to reciprocal recognition and ensures the beginning of a successful symbiotic integration. in host plants, intracellular ca2+ changes are an integral part of the signalling mechanism. in rhizobia it is not yet known whether ca2+ can act as a transducer of symbiotic signals.


RESULTS
a plasmid encoding the bioluminescent ca2+ probe aequorin was introduced into mesorhizobium loti usda 3147t strain to investigate whether a ca2+ response is activated in rhizobia upon perception of plant root exudates. we find that m. loti cells respond to environmental and symbiotic cues through transient elevations in intracellular free ca2+ concentration. only root exudates from the homologous host lotus japonicus induce ca2+ signalling and downstream activation of nodulation genes. the extracellular ca2+ chelator egta inhibits both transient intracellular ca2+ increase and inducible nod gene expression, while not affecting the expression of other genes, either constitutively expressed or inducible.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings indicate a newly described early event in the molecular dialogue between plants and rhizobia and highlight the use of aequorin-expressing bacterial strains as a promising novel approach for research in legume symbiosis.
