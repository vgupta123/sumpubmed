BACKGROUND
a major challenge in the application of marrow transplantation as a route to immunological tolerance of a transplanted organ is to achieve hematopoietic stem cell  engraftment with minimal myelosuppressive treatments.


RESULTS
we here describe a combined antibody protocol which can achieve long-term engraftment with clinically relevant doses of mhc-mismatched bone marrow, without the need for myelosuppressive drugs. although not universally applicable in all strains, we achieved reliable engraftment in permissive strains with a two-stage strategy: involving first, treatment with anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> in advance of transplantation; and second, treatment with antibodies targeting cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd40l  at the time of marrow transplantation. long-term mixed chimerism through co-receptor and co-stimulation blockade facilitated tolerance to donor-type skin grafts, without any evidence of donor-antigen driven regulatory t cells.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that antibodies targeting co-receptor and co-stimulatory molecules synergise to enable mixed hematopoietic chimerism and central tolerance, showing that neither cytoreductive conditioning nor 'megadoses' of donor bone marrow are required for donor hsc to engraft in permissive strains.
