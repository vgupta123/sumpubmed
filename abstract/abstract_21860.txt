BACKGROUND
the genus oryza is composed of  <dig> distinct genome types,  <dig> diploid and  <dig> polyploid, and includes the world's most important food crop â€“ rice . genome size variation in the oryza is more than 3-fold and ranges from  <dig> mbp in oryza glaberrima  to  <dig> mbp in the polyploid oryza ridleyi . because repetitive elements are known to play a significant role in genome size variation, we constructed random sheared small insert genomic libraries from  <dig> representative oryza species and conducted a comprehensive study of the repetitive element composition, distribution and phylogeny in this genus. particular attention was paid to the role played by the most important classes of transposable elements  in shaping these genomes and in their contributing to genome size variation.


RESULTS
we identified the elements primarily responsible for the most strikingly genome size variation in oryza. we demonstrated how long terminal repeat retrotransposons belonging to the same families have proliferated to very different extents in various species. we also showed that the pool of long terminal repeat retrotransposons is substantially conserved and ubiquitous throughout the oryza and so its origin is ancient and its existence predates the speciation events that originated the genus. finally we described the peculiar behavior of repeats in the species oryza coarctata  whose placement in the oryza genus is controversial.


CONCLUSIONS
long terminal repeat retrotransposons are the major component of the oryza genomes analyzed and, along with polyploidization, are the most important contributors to the genome size variation across the oryza genus. two families of ty3-gypsy elements  account for a significant portion of the genome size variations present in the oryza genus.
