BACKGROUND
baculoviruses are well known for their potential as biological agents for controlling agricultural and forest pests. they are also widely used as expression vectors in molecular cloning studies. the genome sequences of  <dig> baculoviruses are currently available in ncbi databases. as the number of sequenced viral genomes increases, it is important for the authors to present sufficiently detailed analyses and annotations to advance understanding of them. in this study, the complete genome of clanis bilineata nucleopolyhedrovirus  has been sequenced and analyzed in order to understand this virus better.


RESULTS
the genome of clbinpv contains  <dig>  base pairs  with a g+c content of 37%, and  <dig> putative open reading frames  of at least  <dig> nucleotides. one hundred and twenty-six of these orfs have homologues with other baculovirus genes while the other  <dig> are unique to clbinpv. the  <dig> baculovirus core genes are all present in clbinpv. phylogenetic analysis based on the combined pif- <dig> and lef- <dig> sequences places clbinpv in the group ii alphabaculoviruses. this result is consistent with the absence of gp <dig> from the clbinpv genome and the presence instead of a fusion protein gene, characteristic of group ii. blast searches revealed that clbinpv encodes a photolyase-like gene sequence, which has a 1-bp deletion when compared with photolyases of other baculoviruses. this deletion disrupts the sequence into two small photolyase orfs, designated clbiphr- <dig> and clbiphr- <dig>  which correspond to the cpd-dna photolyase and fad-binding domains of photolyases, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
clbinpv belongs to the group ii alphabaculoviruses and is most closely related to orlenpv, ldmnpv, tnsnpv, ecobnpv and chchnpv. it contains a variant dna photolyase gene, which only exists in chchnpv, tnsnpv and spltgv among the baculoviruses.
