BACKGROUND
the sequences of the 16s rrna genes extracted from fecal samples provide insights into the dynamics of fecal microflora. this potentially gives valuable etiological information for patients whose conditions have been ascribed to unknown pathogens, which cannot be accomplished using routine culture methods. we studied  <dig> children with diarrhea who were admitted to the childrenâ€™s hospital in shanxi province during  <dig> 


RESULTS
nineteen of  <dig> children with diarrhea could not be etiologically diagnosed by routine culture and polymerase chain reaction methods. eleven of  <dig> children with diarrhea of unknown etiology had streptococcus as the most dominant fecal bacterial genus at admission. eight of nine children whom three consecutive fecal samples were collected had streptococcus as the dominant fecal bacterial genus, including three in the streptococcus bovis group and three streptococcus sp., which was reduced during and after recovery. we isolated strains that were possibly from the s. bovis group from feces sampled at admission, which were then identified as streptococcus lutetiensis from one child and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus from two children. we sequenced the genome of s. lutetiensis and identified five antibiotic islands, two pathogenicity islands, and five unique genomic islands. the identified virulence genes included hemolytic toxin cylz of streptococcus agalactiae and sortase associated with colonization of pathogenic streptococci.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified s. lutetiensis and s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus from children with diarrhea of unknown etiology, and found pathogenic islands and virulence genes in the genome of s. lutetiensis.
