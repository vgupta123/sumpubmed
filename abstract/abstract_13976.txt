BACKGROUND
diabetes and particularly high blood glucose levels are implicated in neurodegeneration. one of the hallmarks of neurodegeneration is protein aggregation. we investigated the presence of protein aggregation in the frontal brain of zucker diabetic fatty  rats, an animal model for diabetes. further, the effect of nahs in suppressing protein aggregation in cultured brain slices from zdf was assessed.


RESULTS
the levels of protein synthesis, protein/gene expression, autophagy and anti-oxidant defense were evaluated in zdf and control  brains.

compared to lean, zdf brains displayed a significant increase in protein aggregates, p-tau, fibronectin expression and protein glycosylation. increased phosphorylation of mtor and s <dig> ribosomal protein in zdf indicated higher protein synthesis, while the increase in ubiquitinated proteins and lc3-i in zdf brains accompanied by lower lc3-ii expression and lc3-ii/lc3-i levels indicated the blockage of proteolytic pathways. cbs  protein and mrna expression and thiol group levels in zdf brains were lower compared to lean. zdf brains show a higher level of reactive oxygen species. in vitro nahs treatment normalized proteostasis while counteracting oxidative stress.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate increased protein synthesis and aggregation in the diabetic zdf rat brain, which was reversible by nahs treatment.

this is the first report on the potential use of nahs as a novel strategy against protein aggregation in diabetic brain.
