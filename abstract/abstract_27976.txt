BACKGROUND
reactive carbonyl species , such as methylglyoxal  and glyoxal , are synthesized as toxic metabolites in living systems. mechanisms of rcs detoxification include the glutathione -dependent system consisting of glyoxalase i  and glyoxalase ii , and gsh-independent system involving glyoxalase iii . hsp <dig> and dj- <dig> proteins are weakly homologous to each other and belong to two different subfamilies of the dj-1/hsp31/pfpi superfamily. recently, the escherichia coli hsp <dig> protein and the dj- <dig> proteins from arabidopsis thaliana and metazoans have been demonstrated to have glo <dig> activity.


RESULTS
we performed a systematic survey of homologs of dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> in fungi. we found that dj- <dig> proteins have a very limited distribution in fungi, whereas hsp <dig> proteins are widely distributed among different fungal groups. phylogenetic analysis revealed that fungal and metazoan dj- <dig> proteins and bacterial yajl proteins are most closely related and together form a sister clade to bacterial and fungal hsp <dig> proteins. we showed that two schizosaccharomyces pombe hsp <dig> proteins  and one saccharomyces cerevisiae hsp <dig> protein  displayed significantly higher in vitro glo <dig> activity than s. pombe dj- <dig> . overexpression of hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and schsp <dig> could confer mg and go resistance on either wild-type s. pombe cells or glo <dig> deletion of s. pombe. s. pombe dj- <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins exhibit different patterns of subcellular localization.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that fungal hsp <dig> proteins are the major glo <dig> that may have some role in protecting cells from rcs toxicity in fungi. our results also support the view that the glo <dig> activity of hsp <dig> proteins may have evolved independently from that of dj- <dig> proteins.
