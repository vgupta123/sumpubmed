BACKGROUND
receptor tyrosine kinases  are crucial components of signal transduction systems in multicellular animals. surprisingly, numerous rtks have been identified in the genomes of unicellular choanoflagellates and other protists. here, we report the first biochemical study of a unicellular rtk, namely rtkb <dig> from monosiga brevicollis.


RESULTS
we cloned, expressed, and purified the rtkb <dig> kinase, and showed that it is enzymatically active. the activity of rtkb <dig> is controlled by autophosphorylation, as in metazoan rtks. rtkb <dig> possesses six copies of a unique domain  in its c-terminal tail. an isolated rm <dig> domain  served as a substrate for rtkb <dig> kinase. when phosphorylated, the rm <dig> domain bound to the src homology  <dig> domain of mbsrc <dig> from m. brevicollis. nmr structural studies of the rm <dig> domain indicated that it is disordered in solution.


CONCLUSIONS
our results are consistent with a model in which rtkb <dig> activation stimulates receptor autophosphorylation within the rm <dig> domains. this leads to recruitment of src-like kinases  and further phosphorylation, which may serve to increase or dampen downstream signals. thus, crucial features of signal transduction circuitry were established prior to the evolution of metazoans from their unicellular ancestors.
