BACKGROUND
the growth strategy of a species influences many key aspects of its life-history. animals can either grow indeterminately , or grow determinately, ceasing at maturity. in mammals, continued weight gain after maturity is clearly distinguishable from continued skeletal growth . elephants represent an interesting candidate for studying growth because of their large size, long life and sexual dimorphism. objective measures of their weight, height and age, however, are rare.


RESULTS
we investigate evidence for indeterminate growth in the asian elephant elephas maximus using a longitudinal dataset from a semi-captive population. we fit growth curves to weight and height measurements, assess sex differences in growth, and test for indeterminate growth by comparing the asymptotes for height and weight curves. our results show no evidence for indeterminate growth in the asian elephant; neither sex increases in height throughout life, with the majority of height growth completed by the age of 15 years in females and 21 years in males. females show a similar pattern with weight, whereas males continue to gain weight until over age  <dig>  neither sex shows any declines in weight with age.


CONCLUSIONS
these results have implications for understanding mammalian life-history, which could include sex-specific differences in trade-offs between size and reproductive investment.
