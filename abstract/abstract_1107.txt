BACKGROUND
small untranslated rnas  are widespread regulators of gene expression in bacteria. this study reports on a comprehensive screen for srnas in the symbiotic nitrogen-fixing alpha-proteobacterium sinorhizobium meliloti applying deep sequencing of cdnas and microarray hybridizations.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  srna candidates that were classified as trans-encoded srnas , cis-encoded antisense srnas , mrna leader transcripts , and sense srnas overlapping coding regions  were identified in a size range of  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides. among these were transcripts corresponding to  <dig> previously reported srna candidates. enrichment for rnas with primary 5'-ends prior to sequencing of cdnas suggested transcriptional start sites corresponding to  <dig> predicted srna regions. the consensus Ïƒ <dig> promoter motif cttgac-n17-ctatat was found upstream of  <dig> srna candidates. expression patterns derived from microarray hybridizations provided further information on conditions of expression of a number of srna candidates. furthermore, genbank, embl, ddbj, pdb, and rfam databases were searched for homologs of the srna candidates identified in this study. searching rfam family models with over  <dig>  srna candidates, re-discovered only those sequences from s. meliloti already known and stored in rfam, whereas blast searches suggested a number of homologs in related alpha-proteobacteria.


CONCLUSIONS
the screening data suggests that in s. meliloti about 3% of the genes encode trans-encoded srnas and about 2% antisense transcripts. thus, this first comprehensive screen for srnas applying deep sequencing in an alpha-proteobacterium shows that srnas also occur in high number in this group of bacteria.
