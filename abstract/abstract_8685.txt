BACKGROUND
administration of mercury at nontoxic doses induces systemic autoimmune disease in brown norway  rats. the pathogenesis of lupus-like oral mucosal lesion by mercury-induced autoimmunity is still unclear, even though the oral mucosa is observed to be commonly affected in mercury-treated bn rats. in this study, we investigated the immunopathology of lupus-like oral mucosal lesions in a model of mercury-induced systemic autoimmunity.

methods
brown norway male rats were injected subcutaneously with either phosphate-buffered saline  or mercury at a dose of  <dig>  mg per kilogram of body weight on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  blood, kidney, and tongue samples were taken at various timepoints for evaluation by immunohistochemistry, rt-pcr, and lupus band test .


RESULTS
oral mucosal lesions were classified according to three consecutive temporal phases on the basis of infiltration of immunocompetent cells as follows:  infiltration of mhc class ii+ dendritic cells  and macrophages;  addition of ed1+ macrophage infiltrates; and  focal infiltration of pan t cells following increased infiltration of dc and macrophages. dense infiltration of dc and macrophages was observed in the basement membrane  zone of the oral epithelium. tissue expression of il- <dig> mrna was detected in early lesions , suggesting that locally produced il- <dig> may be responsible for th2-mediated immune response. a linear and continuous smooth pattern of fluorescence was observed in the oral epithelial bm in addition to renal glomeruli, indicating immune complex deposits.


CONCLUSIONS
local autoimmune responses are involved in the pathogenesis of mercury-induced lupus-like lesions of the oral mucosa.
