BACKGROUND
the mp <dig> gene of candida albicans  encodes a putative β-glucanase mannoprotein of  <dig> kda, which plays a main role in a host-fungus relationship, morphogenesis and pathogenicity. in this study, we performed an extensive analysis of a mp65Δ mutant to assess the role of this protein in cell wall integrity, adherence to epithelial cells and biofilm formation.


RESULTS
the mp65Δ mutant showed a high sensitivity to a range of cell wall-perturbing and degrading agents, especially congo red, which induced morphological changes such as swelling, clumping and formation of hyphae. the mp65Δ mutant showed an activation of two mapks , a high level of expression of two stress-related genes , and a modulated expression of β-glucan epitopes, but no gross changes in cell wall polysaccharide composition. interestingly, the mp65Δ mutant displayed a marked reduction in adhesion to bec and caco- <dig> cells and severe defects in biofilm formation when compared to the wild type. all of the mentioned properties were totally or partially recovered in a revertant strain, demonstrating the specificity of gene deletion.


CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that the mp <dig> gene of candida albicans plays a significant role in maintaining cell wall integrity, as well as in adherence to epithelia and biofilm formation, which are major virulence attributes of this fungus.
