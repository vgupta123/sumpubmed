BACKGROUND
many commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, are restricted in their potential anti-neoplastic effectiveness by their side effects, with one of the most problematic being induction of peripheral neuropathy. although a number of different neurotrophic, neuroprotective or anti-oxidant treatments have been tried in order to prevent or treat the neuropathies, to date they have met with limited success. phenoxodiol is a new chemotherapeutic agent that has anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects on a range of cancer cells. pc <dig> cells are a commonly used neuronal cell model for examination of neurite outgrowth. in this study we examined whether phenoxodiol could protect against cisplatin induced neurite inhibition in pc <dig> cells as an indication of the potential to protect against neuropathy.


RESULTS
using the pc <dig> neuronal cell line, concentrations of cisplatin were chosen that induced moderate or strong neurite toxicity within  <dig> hrs but were not cytotoxic. the effect of phenoxodiol on cisplatin induced neurite toxicity was assessed by measurement of neurite outgrowth. addition of phenoxodiol at  <dig> nm or  <dig> μm showed no cytotoxicity and blocked the cisplatin induced neurite toxicity, while phenoxodiol at  <dig> μm was cytotoxic and enhanced neurite toxicity of cisplatin. when cisplatin was added for  <dig> hrs, then washed out and the cells allowed to recover for  <dig> hrs, neurite outgrowth was not restored and addition of phenoxodiol did not further promote recovery or restore the cisplatin treated cells.


CONCLUSIONS
in addition to its potential as a chemotherapeutic agent phenoxodiol may thus also have the potential to be used in conjunction with cisplatin chemotherapy to prevent induction of neuropathy.
