BACKGROUND
there is interest in improving the flavor of commercial strawberry  varieties. fruit flavor is shaped by combinations of sugars, acids and volatile compounds. many efforts seek to use genomics-based strategies to identify genes controlling flavor, and then designing durable molecular markers to follow these genes in breeding populations. in this report, fruit from two cultivars, varying for presence-absence of volatile compounds, along with segregating progeny, were analyzed using gc/ms and rnaseq. expression data were bulked in silico according to presence/absence of a given volatile compound, in this case γ-decalactone, a compound conferring a peach flavor note to fruits.


RESULTS
computationally sorting reads in segregating progeny based on γ-decalactone presence eliminated transcripts not directly relevant to the volatile, revealing transcripts possibly imparting quantitative contributions. one candidate encodes an omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase, an enzyme known to participate in lactone production in fungi, noted here as fafad <dig>  this candidate was induced by ripening, was detected in certain harvests, and correlated with γ-decalactone presence. the fafad <dig> gene is present in every genotype where γ-decalactone has been detected, and it was invariably missing in non-producers. a functional, pcr-based molecular marker was developed that cosegregates with the phenotype in f <dig> and bc <dig> populations, as well as in many other cultivars and wild fragaria accessions.


CONCLUSIONS
genetic, genomic and analytical chemistry techniques were combined to identify fafad <dig>  a gene likely controlling a key flavor volatile in strawberry. the same data may now be re-sorted based on presence/absence of any other volatile to identify other flavor-affecting candidates, leading to rapid generation of gene-specific markers.
