BACKGROUND
due to the widespread abusage of antibiotics, antibiotic-resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae  has been increasing quickly in recent years, and it is obviously urgent to develop new types of antibiotics. two-component systems  are the major signal transduction pathways in bacteria and have emerged as potential targets for antibacterial drugs. among the  <dig> pairs of tcss proteins presenting in s. pneumoniae, vicr/k is the unique one essential for bacterium growth, and block agents to which, if can be found, may be developed as effective antibiotics against s. pneumoniae infection.


RESULTS
using a structure-based virtual screening  method,  <dig> compounds were computationally identified as potential inhibitors of the histidine kinase  vick protein from the compound library specs. six of them were then validated in vitro to be active in inhibiting the growth of s. pneumoniae without obvious cytotoxicity to vero cell. in mouse sepsis models, these compounds are still able to decrease the mortality of the mice infected by s. pneumoniae and one compound even has significant therapeutic effect.


CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, these compounds are the first reported inhibitors of hk with antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo, and are novel lead structures for developing new drugs to combat pneumococcal infection.
