BACKGROUND
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded  tissues represent the most abundant resource of archived human specimens in pathology. such tissue specimens are emerging as a highly valuable resource for translational proteomic studies. in quantitative proteomic analysis, reductive di-methylation of primary amines using stable isotopic formaldehyde variants is increasingly used due to its robustness and cost-effectiveness.


RESULTS
in the present study we show for the first time that isotopic amine dimethylation can be used in a straightforward manner for the quantitative proteomic analysis of ffpe specimens without interference from formalin employed in the ffpe process. isotopic amine dimethylation of ffpe specimens showed equal labeling efficiency as for cryopreserved specimens. for both ffpe and cryopreserved specimens, differential labeling of identical samples yielded highly similar ratio distributions within the expected range for dimethyl labeling. in an initial application, we profiled proteome changes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma  ffpe tissue specimens compared to adjacent non–malignant renal tissue. our findings highlight increased levels of glyocolytic enzymes, annexins as well as ribosomal and proteasomal proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
our study establishes isotopic amine dimethylation as a versatile tool for quantitative proteomic analysis of ffpe specimens and underlines proteome alterations in ccrcc.
