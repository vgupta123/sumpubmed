BACKGROUND
most studies examining the commensal human oral microbiome are focused on disease or are limited in methodology. in order to diagnose and treat diseases at an early and reversible stage an in-depth definition of health is indispensible. the aim of this study therefore was to define the healthy oral microbiome using recent advances in sequencing technology .


RESULTS
we sampled and sequenced microbiomes from several intraoral niches  in three healthy individuals. within an individual oral cavity, we found over  <dig> unique sequences, over  <dig> different otus or "species-level" phylotypes  and  <dig> -  <dig> higher taxa . the predominant taxa belonged to firmicutes , proteobacteria , actinobacteria , bacteroidetes  and fusobacteria .

each individual sample harboured on average  <dig> "species-level" phylotypes  with cheek samples being the least diverse and the dental samples from approximal surfaces showing the highest diversity. principal component analysis discriminated the profiles of the samples originating from shedding surfaces  from the samples that were obtained from solid surfaces .

there was a large overlap in the higher taxa, "species-level" phylotypes and unique sequences among the three microbiomes: 84% of the higher taxa, 75% of the otus and 65% of the unique sequences were present in at least two of the three microbiomes. the three individuals shared  <dig> of  <dig> unique sequences. these  <dig> sequences  contributed 66% of the reads. the overlapping otus contributed to 94% of the reads, while nearly all reads  belonged to the shared higher taxa.


CONCLUSIONS
we obtained the first insight into the diversity and uniqueness of individual oral microbiomes at a resolution of next-generation sequencing. we showed that a major proportion of bacterial sequences of unrelated healthy individuals is identical, supporting the concept of a core microbiome at health.
