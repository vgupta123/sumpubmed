BACKGROUND
araucariaceae are important forest trees of the southern hemisphere. life expectancy of their seedlings can largely be reduced by fungal infections. in this study we have isolated and characterized such a fungus and investigated the potential of streptomyces actinobacteria from the respective rhizosphere to act as antagonists.


RESULTS
the pathogenic fungus from araucaria angustifolia seeds was identified by morphological markers  as belonging to the pezizomycotina. molecular data identified the fungus as neofusicoccum parvum . co-cultures on agar of this fungus with certain streptomycete isolates from the rhizosphere, and from the surface of araucaria roots significantly reduced the growth of the fungus. hplc analysis of the agar yielded streptomycete-specific exudate compounds which were partly identified. there were differences in compounds between single  and dual cultures .


CONCLUSIONS
streptomycetes from the rhizosphere of araucariaceae produce exudates which can suppress the development of pathogenic fungi in their seeds.
