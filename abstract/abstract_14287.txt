BACKGROUND
the s. cerevisiae mapkkk ste11p, a homologue of mammalian mekk <dig>  regulates three mapk cascades for mating, invasive growth and osmotic stress and provides functions that are additive with the cell wall integrity pathway. cell wall integrity requires the fks <dig> gene that encodes a stress-induced alternative subunit of beta- <dig>   <dig> glucan synthase that is the target of echinocandin  <dig> - beta glucan synthase inhibitors. the major signal transduction pathways that activate transcription of the fks <dig> gene include the cell wall integrity and calcineurin pathways, and the ste11p pathway.


RESULTS
here it is shown that catalytically active ste11p regulates fks2-lacz reporter genes through ste <dig>  calcineurin/crz1p- and pkc pathways and the high osmolarity pathway. ste11p stimulated the cell wall integrity mapk mpk1p  and fks <dig> independently of the mating pathway. ste11p regulated fks <dig> through all known and putative substrates: pbs2p mapkk, ste <dig> mapkk, cmk2p calmodulin dependent kinase and ptk2p kinase. ste11p increased the expression level of cmk2p through transcription-dependent and -independent mechanisms.


CONCLUSIONS
the data suggest ste11p regulates the fks <dig> gene through all its known and putative downstream kinase substrates  and separately through mpk1p mapk. the patterns of control by ste11p targets revealed novel functional linkages, cross-regulation, redundancy and compensation.
