BACKGROUND
although the needs for analyses of secondary structures of rnas are increasing, prediction of the secondary structures of rnas are not always reliable. because an rna may have a complicated energy landscape, comprehensive representations of the whole ensemble of the secondary structures, such as the probability distributions of various features of rna secondary structures are required.


RESULTS
a general method to efficiently compute the distribution of any integer scalar/vector function on the secondary structure is proposed. we also show two concrete algorithms, for hamming distance from a reference structure and for 5ʹ − 3ʹ distance, which can be constructed by following our general method. these practical applications of this method show the effectiveness of the proposed method.


CONCLUSIONS
the proposed method provides a clear and comprehensive procedure to construct algorithms for distributions of various integer features. in addition, distributions of integer vectors, that is a combination of different integer scores, can be also described by applying our 2d expanding technique.
