BACKGROUND
ice  family genes play an important role in the regulation of cold tolerance pathways. in an earlier study, we isolated the gene cdice <dig> from chrysanthemum dichrum and demonstrated that freezing tolerance was enhanced by cdice <dig> overexpression. therefore, we sought to determine the mechanism by which ice <dig> family genes participate in freezing tolerance.


RESULTS
using emsa  and yeast one-hybrid assays, we confirmed that cdice <dig> binds specifically to the myc element in the cddreba promoter and activates transcription. in addition, overexpression of cdice <dig> enhanced arabidopsis freezing tolerance after transition from 23°c to 4°c or 16°c. we found that after acclimation to 4°c, cdice <dig>  like arabidopsis atice <dig>  promoted expression of cbfs  and their genes downstream involved in freezing tolerance, including cor15a , cor <dig> , and rd29a . interestingly, we observed that cdice1-overexpressing plants experienced significant reduction in mir <dig>  in addition, its target genes csd <dig>  and csd <dig> showed inducible expression under acclimation at 16°c, indicating that the mir398-csd pathway was involved in the induction of freezing tolerance.


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that cdice1-mediated freezing tolerance occurs via different pathways, involving either cbf or mir <dig>  under acclimation at two different temperatures.
