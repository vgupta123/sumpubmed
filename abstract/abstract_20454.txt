BACKGROUND
repeated exposure to addictive drugs elicits long-lasting cellular and molecular changes. it has been reported that the aberrant expression of long non-coding rnas  is involved in cocaine and heroin addiction, yet the expression profile of lncrnas and their potential effects on methamphetamine -induced locomotor sensitization are largely unknown.


RESULTS
using high-throughput strand-specific complementary dna sequencing technology , here we examined the alterations in the lncrnas expression profile in the nucleus accumbens  of meth-sensitized mice. we found that the expression levels of  <dig> known lncrnas  and  <dig> novel lncrna candidates  were significantly altered in the meth-sensitized mice. based on characterizations of the genomic contexts of the lncrnas, we further showed that there were  <dig> differentially expressed lncrnas acted via cis mechanisms, including sense intronic , overlapping , natural antisense transcripts , long intergenic non-coding rnas , and bidirectional . moreover, using the program rnaplex, we identified  <dig> differentially expressed lncrnas acted via trans mechanisms. gene ontology  and kegg pathway enrichment analyses revealed that the predicted cis- and trans- associated genes were significantly enriched during neuronal development, neuronal plasticity, learning and memory, and reward and addiction.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our results suggest that meth can elicit global changes in lncrna expressions in the nac of sensitized mice that might be involved in meth-induced locomotor sensitization and addiction.
