BACKGROUND
although modified live virus  vaccines are commonly used for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  control, there have been safety concerns due to the quick reversion of mlv to virulence during replication in pigs. previous studies have demonstrated that mutant viruses emerged from lethal mutagenesis driven by antiviral mutagens and that those viruses had higher genetic stability compared to their parental strains because they acquired resistance to random mutation. thus, this strategy was explored to stabilize the prrsv genome in the current study.


RESULTS
four antiviral mutagens  were evaluated for their antiviral effects against vr <dig>  a prototype of type  <dig> prrsv. among the mutagens, ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil had significant antiviral effects against vr <dig>  consequently, vr <dig> was serially passaged in marc- <dig> cells in the presence of ribavirin at several concentrations to facilitate the emergence of ribavirin-resistant mutants. two ribavirin-resistant mutants, rvrp <dig> and rvrp <dig>  emerged from serial passages in the presence of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm ribavirin, respectively. the genetic stability of these resistant mutants was evaluated in marc- <dig> cells and compared with vr <dig>  as expected, the ribavirin-resistant mutants exhibited higher genetic stability compared to their parental virus.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil effectively suppressed prrsv replication in marc- <dig> cells. however, ribavirin-resistant mutants emerged when treated with low concentrations  of ribavirin, and those mutants were genetically more stable during serial passages in cell culture.
