BACKGROUND
in eukaryotes, histone h <dig> lysine  <dig>  methylation is a common mechanism involved in gene silencing and the establishment of heterochromatin. the loci of the major heterochromatic h3k <dig> methyltransferase su3- <dig> and the functionally unrelated γ subunit of the translation initiation factor eif <dig> are fused in drosophila melanogaster. here we examined the phylogenetic distribution of this unusual gene fusion and the molecular evolution of the h3k <dig> hmtase su3- <dig> 


RESULTS
we show that the gene fusion had taken place in the ancestral line of winged insects and silverfishs  about  <dig> million years ago. we cloned su3- <dig> genes from a collembolan and a spider where both genes ancestrally exist as independent transcription units. in contrast, we found a su3-9-specific exon inside the conserved intron position 81- <dig> of the eif2γ gene structure in species of eight different insect orders. intriguinly, in the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum, we detected only sequence remains of this su3- <dig> exon in the eif2γ intron, along with an eif2γ-independent su3- <dig> gene. this reveals an evolutionary re-fission of both genes in aphids. su3- <dig> chromo domains are similar to hp <dig> chromo domains, which points to a potential binding activity to methylated k <dig> of histone h <dig>  set domain comparisons suggest a weaker methyltransferase activity of su3- <dig> in comparison to other h3k <dig> hmtases. astonishingly,  <dig> of  <dig> previously described, deleterious amino acid substitutions found in drosophila su3- <dig> are seemingly compensable through accompanying substitutions during evolution.


CONCLUSIONS
examination of the su3- <dig> evolution revealed strong evidence for the establishment of the su3-9/eif2γ gene fusion in an ancestor of dicondylic insects and a re-fission of this fusion during the evolution of aphids. our comparison of  <dig> selected chromo domains and  <dig> selected set domains from su3- <dig> and related proteins offers functional predictions concerning both domains in su3- <dig> proteins.
