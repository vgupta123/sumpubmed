BACKGROUND
atnhx <dig>  the most abundant vacuolar na+/h+ antiporter in arabidopsis thaliana, mediates the transport of na+ and k+ into the vacuole, influencing plant development and contributing to salt tolerance. in this report, microarray expression profiles of wild type plants, a t-dna insertion knockout mutant of atnhx <dig> , and a 'rescued' line  were exposed to both short  and long  durations of a non-lethal salt stress to identify key gene transcripts associated with the salt response that are influenced by atnhx <dig> 


RESULTS
 <dig> transcripts showed both salt responsiveness and a significant influence of atnhx <dig>  fifty-seven of these genes showed an influence of the antiporter across all salt treatments, while the remaining genes were influenced as a result of a particular duration of salt stress. most  of the genes were up-regulated in the absence of atnhx <dig>  with the exception of transcripts encoding proteins involved with metabolic and energy processes that were mostly down-regulated.


CONCLUSIONS
while part of the atnhx1-influenced transcripts were unclassified, other transcripts with known or putative roles showed the importance of atnhx <dig> to key cellular processes that were not necessarily limited to the salt stress response; namely calcium signaling, sulfur metabolism, cell structure and cell growth, as well as vesicular trafficking and protein processing. only a small number of other salt-responsive membrane transporter transcripts appeared significantly influenced by atnhx <dig>
