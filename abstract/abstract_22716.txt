BACKGROUND
there are a growing number of reports on the sub-physiological temperature culturing of mammalian cells for increased recombinant protein yields. however, the effect varies and the reasons for the enhancement are not fully elucidated. expression of cold-inducible rna-binding protein  is known to be induced in response to mild, but not severe, hypothermia in mammalian cells. to clarify the molecular mechanism underlying the induction and to exploit this to improve the productivity of recombinant proteins, we tried to identify the regulatory sequence in the 5′ flanking region of the mouse cirp gene.


RESULTS
by transiently transfecting hek <dig> cells with plasmids expressing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase as a reporter, we found that the cirp 5′ flanking region octanucleotide 5′-tccccgcc-3′ is a mild-cold responsive element . when  <dig> copies of mcre were placed upstream of the cmv promoter and used in transient transfection, reporter gene expression was increased 3- to 7-fold at 32°c relative to 37°c in various cell lines including hek <dig>  u- <dig> os, nih/3t <dig>  balb/3t <dig> and cho-k <dig> cells. in stable transfectants, mcre also enhanced the reporter gene expression at 32°c, although more copy numbers of mcre were necessary. sp <dig> transcription factor bound to mcre in vitro. immunohistochemistry and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that more sp <dig>  but not sp <dig>  was localized in the nucleus to bind to the cirp regulatory region containing mcre at 32°c than 37°c. overexpression of sp <dig> protein increased the expression of endogenous cirp as well as a reporter gene driven by the 5′ flanking region of the cirp gene, and down-regulation of sp <dig> had the opposite effect. mutations within the mcre sequence in the 5′ flanking region abolished the effects of sp <dig> on the reporter gene expression both at 37°c and 32°c.


CONCLUSIONS
cold-induced, as well as constitutive, expression of cirp is dependent, at least partly, on mcre and sp <dig>  the present novel enhancer permits conditional high-level gene expression at moderately low culture temperatures and could be utilized to increase the yield of recombinant proteins in mammalian cells.
