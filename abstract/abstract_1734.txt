BACKGROUND
the appropriate timing of bolting and flowering is pivotal for reproductive success in brassicaceae crops including radish . although several flowering regulatory pathways had been described in some plant species, no study on genetic networks of bolting and flowering regulation was performed in radish. in this study, to generate dataset of radish unigene sequences for large-scale gene discovery and functional pathway identification, a cdna library from mixed radish leaves at different developmental stages was subjected to high-throughput rna sequencing .


RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  million clean reads and  <dig>  contigs representing  <dig>  unigenes were obtained from the radish leaf transcriptome. among these,  <dig>  unigenes were successfully annotated by blast searching against the public protein databases. functional classification and annotation indicated that  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique sequences were assigned to  <dig> go terms and  <dig> cog categories, respectively. kegg pathway analysis revealed that  <dig>  unigenes were classified into  <dig> functional pathways, among which  <dig> candidate genes related to plant circadian rhythm were identified. moreover,  <dig> potential bolting and flowering-related genes involved in various flowering pathways were identified. in addition, seven critical bolting and flowering-related genes were isolated and profiled by t-a cloning and rt-qpcr analysis. finally, a schematic network model of bolting and flowering regulation and pathways was put forward in radish.


CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first report on systematic identification of bolting and flowering-related genes based on transcriptome sequencing and assembly in radish. these results could provide a foundation for further investigating bolting and flowering regulatory networks in radish, and facilitate dissecting molecular genetic mechanisms underlying bolting and flowering in brassicaceae vegetable crops.
