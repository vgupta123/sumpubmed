BACKGROUND
in the process of developing a microplate-based growth assay, we discovered that our test organism, a native e. coli isolate, displayed very uniform doubling times  only up to a certain threshold cell density. below this cell concentration  we observed an obvious increase in the τ scatter.


RESULTS
working with a food-borne e. coli isolate we found that τ values derived from two different microtiter platereader-based techniques  were in excellent agreement with the same parameter acquired from total aerobic plate counting. thus, using either luria-bertani  or defined  media at 37°c, τ ranged between 17- <dig>  or 51- <dig>  min. making use of such od data we collected many observations of τ as a function of manifold initial or starting cell concentrations . we noticed that τ appeared to be distributed in two populations  at low ci. when ci ≤ <dig> cfu ml- <dig> , we found that about 48% of the observed τ values were normally distributed around a mean  of  <dig> ±  <dig>  min  and 52% with μτ <dig> =  <dig> ±  <dig>  min . however, at higher starting cell densities , the τ values were distributed unimodally . inclusion of a small amount of ethyl acetate to the lb caused a collapse of the bimodal to a unimodal form. comparable bimodal τ distribution results were also observed using e. coli cells diluted from mid-log phase cultures. similar results were also obtained when using either an e. coli o157:h <dig> or a citrobacter strain. when sterile-filtered lb supernatants, which formerly contained relatively low concentrations of bacteria, were employed as a diluent, there was an evident shift of the two populations towards each other but the bimodal effect was still apparent using either stationary or log phase cells.


CONCLUSIONS
these data argue that there is a dependence of growth rate on starting cell density.
