BACKGROUND
comparative sequence analysis of complex loci such as resistance gene analog clusters allows estimating the degree of sequence conservation and mechanisms of divergence at the intraspecies level. in banana , two diploid wild species musa acuminata  and musa balbisiana  contribute to the polyploid genome of many cultivars. the m. balbisiana species is associated with vigour and tolerance to pests and disease and little is known on the genome structure and haplotype diversity within this species. here, we compare two genomic sequences of  <dig> and  <dig> kb corresponding to two haplotypes of the rga <dig> resistance gene analog locus in m. balbisiana "pisang klutuk wulung" .


RESULTS
sequence comparison revealed two regions of contrasting features. the first is a highly colinear gene-rich region where the two haplotypes diverge only by single nucleotide polymorphisms and two repetitive element insertions. the second corresponds to a large cluster of rga <dig> genes, with  <dig> and  <dig> predicted rga genes and pseudogenes spread over  <dig> and  <dig> kb respectively on each haplotype. the rga <dig> cluster is enriched in repetitive element insertions, in duplicated non-coding intergenic sequences including low complexity regions and shows structural variations between haplotypes. although some allelic relationships are retained, a large diversity of rga <dig> genes occurs in this single m. balbisiana genotype, with several rga <dig> paralogs specific to each haplotype. the rga <dig> gene family has evolved by mechanisms of unequal recombination, intragenic sequence exchange and diversifying selection. an unequal recombination event taking place between duplicated non-coding intergenic sequences resulted in a different rga <dig> gene content between haplotypes pointing out the role of such duplicated regions in the evolution of rga clusters. based on the synonymous substitution rate in coding sequences, we estimated a  <dig> million year divergence time for these m. balbisiana haplotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
a large rga <dig> gene cluster identified in wild banana corresponds to a highly variable genomic region between haplotypes surrounded by conserved flanking regions. high level of sequence identity  of the genic and intergenic regions suggests a recent and rapid evolution of this cluster in m. balbisiana.
