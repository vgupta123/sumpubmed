BACKGROUND
β-carotene  <dig> '-monooxygenase  catalyzes the crucial first step in vitamin a biosynthesis in animals. we wished to explore the possibility that a carbocation intermediate is formed during the cleavage reaction of bcmo <dig>  as is seen for many isoprenoid biosynthesis enzymes, and to determine which residues in the substrate binding cleft are necessary for catalytic and substrate binding activity. to test this hypothesis, we replaced substrate cleft aromatic and acidic residues by site-directed mutagenesis. enzymatic activity was measured in vitro using his-tag purified proteins and in vivo in a β-carotene-accumulating e. coli system.


RESULTS
our assays show that mutation of either y <dig> or y <dig> to leucine  significantly impairs the catalytic activity of the enzyme. moreover, mutation of y <dig> to glutamine  almost eliminates activity . however, replacement of these same tyrosines with phenylalanine or tryptophan does not significantly impair activity, indicating that aromaticity at these residues is crucial. mutations of two other aromatic residues in the binding cleft of bcmo <dig>  f <dig> and w <dig>  to either another aromatic residue or to leucine do not influence the catalytic activity of the enzyme. our ab initio model of bcmo <dig> with β-carotene mounted supports a mechanism involving cation-π stabilization by y <dig> and y <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our data are consistent with the formation of a substrate carbocation intermediate and cation-π stabilization of this intermediate by two aromatic residues in the substrate-binding cleft of bcmo <dig>
