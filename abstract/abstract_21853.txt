BACKGROUND
chickpea  is the third most important pulse crop worldwide. despite its importance, relatively little is known about its genome. the availability of a genome-wide physical map allows rapid fine mapping of qtl, development of high-density genome maps, and sequencing of the entire genome. however, no such a physical map has been developed in chickpea.


RESULTS
we present a genome-wide, bac/bibac-based physical map of chickpea developed by fingerprint analysis. four chickpea bac and bibac libraries, two of which were constructed in this study, were used. a total of  <dig>  clones were fingerprinted, and  <dig>   of the fingerprints validated and used in the physical map assembly. the physical map consists of  <dig>  bac/bibac contigs, with each containing an average of  <dig>  clones and having an average physical length of  <dig> kb. the contigs collectively span approximately  <dig>  mb. by using the physical map, we identified the bac/bibac contigs containing or closely linked to qtl <dig>  for resistance to didymella rabiei  and qtl <dig> for days to first flower , thus further verifying the physical map and confirming its utility in fine mapping and cloning of qtl.


CONCLUSIONS
the physical map represents the first genome-wide, bac/bibac-based physical map of chickpea. this map, along with other genomic resources previously developed in the species and the genome sequences of related species , will provide a foundation necessary for many areas of advanced genomics research in chickpea and other legume species. the inclusion of transformation-ready bibacs in the map greatly facilitates its utility in functional analysis of the legume genomes.
