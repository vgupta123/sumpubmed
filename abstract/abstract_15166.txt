BACKGROUND
external development and optical transparency of embryos make zebrafish exceptionally suitable for in vivo insertional mutagenesis using fluorescent proteins to visualize expression patterns of mutated genes. recently developed gene breaking transposon  vectors greatly improve the fidelity and mutagenicity of transposon-based gene trap vectors.


RESULTS
we constructed and tested a bipartite gbt vector with gal4-vp <dig> as the primary gene trap reporter. our vector also contains a uas:egfp cassette for direct detection of gene trap events by fluorescence. to confirm gene trap events, we generated a uas:mrfp tester line. we screened  <dig> potential founders and established  <dig> gene trap lines. three of our gene trap alleles display homozygous lethal phenotypes ranging from embryonic to late larval: nsf tpl <dig>  atp1a3atpl <dig> and flrtpl <dig>  our gene trap cassette is flanked by direct loxp sites, which enabled us to successfully revert nsf tpl <dig>  atp1a3atpl <dig> and flrtpl <dig> gene trap alleles by injection of cre mrna. the uas:egfp cassette is flanked by direct frt sites. it can be readily removed by injection of flp mrna for use of our gene trap alleles with other tissue-specific gfp-marked lines. the gal4-vp <dig> component of our vector provides two important advantages over other gbt vectors. the first is increased sensitivity, which enabled us to detect previously unnoticed expression of nsf in the pancreas. the second advantage is that all our gene trap lines, including integrations into non-essential genes, can be used as highly specific gal <dig> drivers for expression of other transgenes under the control of gal <dig> uas.


CONCLUSIONS
the gal4-containing bipartite gene breaking transposon vector presented here retains high specificity for integrations into genes, high mutagenicity and revertibility by cre. these features, together with utility as highly specific gal <dig> drivers, make gene trap mutants presented here especially useful to the research community.
