BACKGROUND
salix matsudana koidz. is a fast growing tree species. it has a high cadmium  tolerance capacity, making it potentially suitable for phytoremediation. presently, transcriptomic and physiological cd response mechanisms are poorly understood. transcriptomic analysis in early response to high  cd levels was investigated in leaf and root of cd-resistant s. matsudana koidz..


RESULTS
analysis of the response profiles demonstrate the existence of a complex transcriptional network in the root and leaf when exposed to cd. the main response in the root involved up-regulation of genes associated with defence response via callose deposition in the cell wall and cell wall thickening. in the leaf, transcripts related to biotic stress signalling and secondary metabolism were activated. additionally, many lignin and brassinosteroids synthesis pathway genes were induced mainly in the leaf, indicating that gene response to cd was tissue-specific. the cd transcriptome results were consistent with observed physiological changes.


CONCLUSIONS
the sub-localization, transcriptional network, and physiological regulation demonstrate the tissue-specific manner of cd response, and provide a novel insight into in early response of tree species to cd exposure.
