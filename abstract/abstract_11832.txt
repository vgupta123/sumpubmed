BACKGROUND
the poor reproducibility of matrix-assisted desorption/ionization time-of-flight  spectra limits the effectiveness of the maldi-tof ms-based identification of filamentous fungi with highly heterogeneous phenotypes in routine clinical laboratories. this study aimed to enhance the maldi-tof ms-based identification of filamentous fungi by assessing several architectures of reference spectrum libraries.


RESULTS
we established reference spectrum libraries that included  <dig> filamentous fungus species with various architectures characterized by distinct combinations of the following: i) technical replicates, i.e., the number of analyzed deposits for each culture used to build a reference meta-spectrum ; ii) biological replicates, i.e., the number of rms derived from the distinct subculture of each strain; and iii) the number of distinct strains of a given species. we then compared the effectiveness of each library in the identification of  <dig> prospectively collected clinical isolates, including  <dig> species in  <dig> genera.

identification effectiveness was improved by increasing the number of both rms per strain  and strains for a given species  in a multivariate analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
addressing the heterogeneity of maldi-tof spectra derived from filamentous fungi by increasing the number of rms obtained from distinct subcultures of strains included in the reference spectra library markedly improved the effectiveness of the maldi-tof ms-based identification of clinical filamentous fungi.
