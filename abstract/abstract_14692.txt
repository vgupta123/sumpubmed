BACKGROUND
hiv/aids is a serious threat to public health. the emergence of drug resistance mutations diminishes the effectiveness of drug therapy for hiv/aids. developing a computational prediction of drug resistance phenotype will enable efficient and timely selection of the best treatment regimens.


RESULTS
a unified encoding of protein sequence and structure was used as the feature vector for predicting phenotypic resistance from genotype data. two machine learning algorithms, random forest and k-nearest neighbor, were used. the prediction accuracies were examined by five-fold cross-validation on the genotype-phenotype datasets. a supervised machine learning approach for automatic prediction of drug resistance was developed to handle genotype-phenotype datasets of hiv protease  and reverse transcriptase . it predicts the drug resistance phenotype and its relative severity from a query sequence. the accuracy of the classification was higher than  <dig>  for eight pr inhibitors and  <dig>  for ten rt inhibitors, respectively. the overall cross-validated regression r2-values for the severity of drug resistance were  <dig> – <dig>  for  <dig> pr inhibitors and  <dig> – <dig>  for  <dig> rt inhibitors.


CONCLUSIONS
machine learning using a unified encoding of sequence and protein structure as a feature vector provides an accurate prediction of drug resistance from genotype data. a practical webserver for clinicians has been implemented.
