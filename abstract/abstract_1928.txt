BACKGROUND
smoke released from burning vegetation functions as an important environmental signal promoting the germination of many plant species following a fire. it not only promotes the germination of species from fire-prone habitats, but several species from non-fire-prone areas also respond, including some crops. the germination stimulatory activity can largely be attributed to the presence of a highly active butenolide compound, 3-methyl-2h-furopyran-2-one , that has previously been isolated from plant-derived smoke. several hypotheses have arisen regarding the molecular background of smoke and kar <dig> action.


RESULTS
in this paper we demonstrate that although smoke-water and kar <dig> treatment of maize kernels result in a similar physiological response, the gene expression and the protein ubiquitination patterns are quite different. treatment with smoke-water enhanced the ubiquitination of proteins and activated protein-degradation-related genes. this effect was completely absent from kar1-treated kernels, in which a specific aquaporin gene was distinctly upregulated.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate that the array of bioactive compounds present in smoke-water form an environmental signal that may act together in germination stimulation. it is highly possible that the smoke/kar <dig> 'signal' is perceived by a receptor that is shared with the signal transduction system implied in perceiving environmental cues , or some kind of specialized receptor exists in fire-prone plant species which diverged from a more general one present in a common ancestor, and also found in non fire-prone plants allowing for a somewhat weaker but still significant response. besides their obvious use in agricultural practices, smoke and kar <dig> can be used in studies to gain further insight into the transcriptional changes during germination.
