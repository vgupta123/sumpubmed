BACKGROUND
chad basin, lying within the bidirectional corridor of african sahel, is one of the most populated places in sub-saharan africa today. the origin of its settlement appears connected with holocene climatic ameliorations  that started ~ <dig>  years before present . although both nilo-saharan and niger-congo language families are encountered here, the most diversified group is the chadic branch belonging to the afro-asiatic language phylum. in this article, we investigate the proposed ancient migration of chadic pastoralists from eastern africa based on linguistic data and test for genetic traces of this migration in extant chadic speaking populations.


RESULTS
we performed whole mitochondrial genome sequencing of  <dig> l3f haplotypes, focused on clade l3f <dig> that occurs almost exclusively in chadic speaking people living in the chad basin. these data supported the reconstruction of a l3f phylogenetic tree and calculation of times to the most recent common ancestor for all internal clades. a date ~ <dig>  ybp was estimated for the l3f <dig> sub-haplogroup, which is in good agreement with the supposed migration of chadic speaking pastoralists and their linguistic differentiation from other afro-asiatic groups of east africa. as a whole, the afro-asiatic language family presents low population structure, as  <dig> % of mtdna variation is found within populations and only  <dig> % of variation can be attributed to diversity among language branches. the chadic speaking populations form a relatively homogenous cluster, exhibiting lower diversification than the other afro-asiatic branches .


CONCLUSIONS
the results of our study support an east african origin of mitochondrial l3f <dig> clade that is present almost exclusively within chadic speaking people living in chad basin. whole genome sequence-based dates show that the ancestral haplogroup l3f must have emerged soon after the out-of-africa migration , but the "chadic" l3f <dig> clade has much less internal variation, suggesting an expansion during the holocene period about  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  ybp. this time period in the chad basin is known to have been particularly favourable for the expansion of pastoralists coming from northeastern africa, as suggested by archaeological, linguistic and climatic data.
