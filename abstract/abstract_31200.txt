BACKGROUND
phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate  is required for successful completion of cytokinesis. in addition, both pip <dig> and phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase c  have been localized to the cleavage furrow of dividing mammalian cells. plc hydrolyzes pip <dig> to yield diacylglycerol  and inositol trisphosphate , which in turn induces calcium  release from the er. several studies suggest pip <dig> must be hydrolyzed continuously for continued cleavage furrow ingression. the majority of these studies employ the n-substituted maleimide u <dig> as an inhibitor of plc. however, the specificity of u <dig> is unclear, as its active group closely resembles the non-specific alkylating agent n-ethylmaleimide . in addition, the pathway by which pip <dig> regulates cytokinesis remains to be elucidated.


RESULTS
here we compared the effects of u <dig> and the structurally unrelated plc inhibitor et-18-och <dig>  on cytokinesis in crane-fly and drosophila spermatocytes. our data show that the effects of u <dig> are indeed via plc because u <dig> and et-18-och <dig> produced similar effects on cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton organization that were distinct from those caused by nem. furthermore, treatment with the myosin light chain kinase  inhibitor ml- <dig> caused cleavage furrow regression and loss of both f-actin and phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain from the contractile ring in a manner similar to treatment with u <dig> and et-18-och <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we have used multiple inhibitors to examine the roles of plc and mlck, a predicted downstream target of plc regulation, in cytokinesis. our results are consistent with a model in which pip <dig> hydrolysis acts via ca2+ to activate myosin via mlck and thereby control actin dynamics during constriction of the contractile ring.
