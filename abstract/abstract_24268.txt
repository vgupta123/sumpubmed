BACKGROUND
the regulation and function of mammalian rnas has been increasingly appreciated to operate via rna-protein interactions. with the recent discovery of thousands of novel human rna molecules by high-throughput rna sequencing, efficient methods to uncover rna-protein interactions are urgently required. existing methods to study proteins associated with a given rna are laborious and require substantial amounts of cell-derived starting material. to overcome these limitations, we have developed a rapid and large-scale approach to characterize binding of in vitro transcribed labeled rna to ~ <dig>  human recombinant proteins spotted on protein microarrays.


RESULTS
we have optimized methodology to probe human protein microarrays with full-length rna molecules and have identified  <dig> rna-protein interactions specific for  <dig> coding and non-coding rnas. those proteins showed strong enrichment for common human rna binding domains such as rrm, rbd, as well as k homology and ccch type zinc finger motifs. previously unknown rna-protein interactions were discovered using this technique, and these interactions were biochemically verified between tp <dig> mrna and staufen <dig> protein as well as between hras mrna and cnbp protein. functional characterization of the interaction between staufen  <dig> protein and tp <dig> mrna revealed a novel role for staufen  <dig> in preserving tp <dig> rna stability.


CONCLUSIONS
our approach demonstrates a scalable methodology, allowing rapid and efficient identification of novel human rna-protein interactions using rna hybridization to human protein microarrays. biochemical validation of newly identified interactions between tp53-stau <dig> and hras-cnbp using reciprocal pull-down experiments, both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrates the utility of this approach to study uncharacterized rna-protein interactions.
