BACKGROUND
membrane transporters play crucial roles in living cells. experimental characterization of transporters is costly and time-consuming. current computational methods for transporter characterization still require extensive curation efforts, especially for eukaryotic organisms. we developed a novel genome-scale transporter prediction and characterization system called transporttp that combined homology-based and machine learning methods in a two-phase classification approach. first, traditional homology methods were employed to predict novel transporters based on sequence similarity to known classified proteins in the transporter classification database . second, machine learning methods were used to integrate a variety of features to refine the initial predictions. a set of rules based on transporter features was developed by machine learning using well-curated proteomes as guides.


RESULTS
in a cross-validation using the yeast proteome for training and the proteomes of ten other organisms for testing, transporttp achieved an equivalent recall and precision of  <dig> %, based on transportdb, a manually annotated transporter database. in an independent test using the arabidopsis proteome for training and four recently sequenced plant proteomes for testing, it achieved a recall of  <dig> % and a precision of  <dig> %, according to our manual curation.


CONCLUSIONS
transporttp is the most effective tool for eukaryotic transporter characterization up to date.
