BACKGROUND
to segregate luminance-related, face-related and non-specific components involved in spatio-temporal dynamics of cortical activations to a face stimulus, we recorded cortical responses to face appearance , disappearance , and change  using magnetoencephalography.


RESULTS
activity in and around the primary visual cortex  showed luminance-dependent behavior. any of the three events evoked activity in the middle occipital gyrus  at  <dig> ms and temporo-parietal junction  at  <dig> ms after the onset of each event. onset and change activated the fusiform gyrus , while offset did not. this fg activation showed a triphasic waveform, consistent with results of intracranial recordings in humans.


CONCLUSIONS
analysis employed in this study successfully segregated four different elements involved in the spatio-temporal dynamics of cortical activations in response to a face stimulus. the results show the responses of mog and tpj to be associated with non-specific processes, such as the detection of abrupt changes or exogenous attention. activity in fg corresponds to a face-specific response recorded by intracranial studies, and that in v1/v <dig> is related to a change in luminance.
