BACKGROUND
inter-specific hybridization occurs frequently in plants, which may induce genetic and epigenetic instabilities in the resultant hybrids, allopolyploids and introgressants. it remains unclear however whether pollination by alien pollens of an incompatible species may impose a "biological stress" even in the absence of genome-merger or genetic introgression, whereby genetic and/or epigenetic instability of the maternal recipient genome might be provoked.


RESULTS
we report here the identification of a rice mutator-phenotype from a set of rice plants derived from a crossing experiment involving two remote and apparently incompatible species, oryza sativa l. and oenothera biennis l. the mutator-phenotype  showed distinct alteration in several traits, with the most striking being substantially enlarged panicles. expectably, gel-blotting by total genomic dna of the pollen-donor showed no evidence for introgression. characterization of tong211-lp  and its selfed progenies  ruled out contamination  or polyploidy as a cause for its dramatic phenotypic changes, but revealed transgenerational mobilization of several previously characterized transposable elements , including a mite , and three ltr retrotransposons . aflp and msap fingerprinting revealed extensive, transgenerational alterations in cytosine methylation and to a less extent also genetic variation in tong211-lp and its immediate progenies. mping mobility was found to correlate with cytosine methylation alteration detected by msap but not with genetic variation detected by aflp. assay by q-rt-pcr of the steady-state transcript abundance of a set of genes encoding for the various putative dna methyltransferases, 5-methylcytosine dna glycosylases, and small interference rna  pathway-related proteins showed that, relative to the rice parental line, heritable perturbation in expression of  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes occurred in the mutator-phenotype and its sefled progenies.


CONCLUSIONS
transgenerational epigenetic instability in the form of altered cytosine methylation and its associated te activity occurred in a rice mutator-phenotype produced by pollinating the rice stigma with pollens of o. biennis. heritably perturbed homeostatic expression-state of genes involved in maintenance of chromatin structure is likely an underlying cause for the alien pollination-induced transgenerational epigenetic/genetic instability, and which occurred apparently without entailing genome merger or genetic introgression.
