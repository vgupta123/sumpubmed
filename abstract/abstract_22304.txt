BACKGROUND
ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase  phosphorylates and activates particular downstream protein kinases — including camki, camkiv, and ampk— to stimulate multiple ca2+-signal transduction pathways. to identify previously unidentified camkk substrates, we used various nucleotides as phosphate donors to develop and characterize an in vitro phosphorylation assay for camkk.


RESULTS
here, we found that the recombinant camkk isoforms were capable of utilizing mg-gtp as a phosphate donor to phosphorylate the thr residue in the activation-loop of camkiα  and of ampk  in vitro. kinetic analysis indicated that the km values of camkk isoforms for gtp  were significantly higher than those for atp , and a 2- to 4-fold decrease in vmax was observed with gtp. we also confirmed that an atp competitive camkk inhibitor, sto- <dig>  also competes with gtp to inhibit the activities of camkk isoforms. in addition, to detect enhanced camki phosphorylation in brain extracts with mg-gtp and recombinant camkks, we found potential camkk substrates of ~ <dig> kda and ~ <dig> kda whose ca2+/cam-induced phosphorylation was inhibited by sto- <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicated that screens that use sto- <dig> as a camkk inhibitor and mg-gtp as a camkk-dependent phosphate donor might be useful to identify previously unidentified downstream target substrates of camkk.
