BACKGROUND
the n. attenuata hd <dig> gene belongs to the homeodomain-leucine zipper  type i family of transcription factors and it has been previously associated with the regulation of aba accumulation in leaves and the emission of benzyl acetone  from night flowers. in this study, n. attenuata plants stably reduced in the expression of hd <dig>  were generated to investigate the mechanisms controlling the emission of ba from night flowers.


RESULTS
the expression of hd <dig> in corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants was reduced by  <dig> to 90% compared to wild-type plants  without affecting flower morphology and development. total ba emitted from flowers of ir-hd <dig> plants was reduced on average by 60%. this reduction occurred mainly at the late phase of ba emission and it was correlated with 2-fold higher levels of aba in the corollas of ir-hd <dig> plants. when a 2-fold decline in aba corolla levels of these plants was induced by salt stress, ba emissions recovered to wt levels. supplying aba to wt flowers either through the cuticle or by pedicle feeding reduced the total ba emissions by  <dig> to 50%; this reduction occurred primarily at the late phase of emission . gene expression profiling of corollas collected at 12â€‰pm  revealed that  <dig> genes changed expression levels significantly in ir-hd <dig> plants compared to wt. among these genes, more than 35% were associated with metabolism and the most prominent group was associated with the metabolism of aromatic compounds and phenylpropanoid derivatives.


CONCLUSIONS
the results indicated that regulation of aba levels in corollas is associated with the late phase of ba emission in n. attenuata plants and that hd <dig> affects this latter process by mediating changes in both aba levels and metabolic gene expression.
