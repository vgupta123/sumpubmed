BACKGROUND
bacteria use n-acyl homoserine lactone  molecules to regulate the expression of genes in a density-dependent manner. several biosensors have been developed and engineered to detect the presence of all types of ahls.


RESULTS
in this study, we describe the usefulness of a trai-luxcdabe-based biosensor to quickly detect ahls from previously characterized mutants of burkholderia cenocepacia and pseudomonas aeruginosa in both liquid and soft-agar co-culture assays in a high-throughput manner. the technique uses a co-culture system where the strain producing the ahls is grown simultaneously with the reporter strain. use of this assay in liquid co-culture allows the measurement of ahl activity in real time over growth. we tested this assay with burkholderia cenocepacia and pseudomonas aeruginosa but it should be applicable to a broad range of gram negative species that produce ahls.


CONCLUSIONS
the co-culture assays described enable the detection of ahl production in both p. aeruginosa and b. cenocepacia and should be applicable to ahl analysis in other bacterial species. the high-throughput adaptation of the liquid co-culture assay could facilitate the screening of large libraries for the identification of mutants or compounds that block the synthesis or activity of ahls.
