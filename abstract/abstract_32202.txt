BACKGROUND
eps <dig> is an endocytic adaptor protein that stimulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. among other interactions, eps <dig> binds ubiquitin via uim domains, recruiting ubiquitinated cargo into clathrin-coated vesicles. in egf-treated cells, eps <dig> also localizes to endosomes. the basis of this localization is not known.


RESULTS
we show that accumulation of ubiquitinated cargo can recruit eps <dig> to endosomes via uim domain interactions. first, treatment of sk-br- <dig> breast cancer cells, which overexpress the egfr family member erbb <dig>  with geldanamycin to promote receptor ubiquitination and endosomal transport, recruited flag-eps <dig> to endosomes. two in-frame ubiquitin constructs, pm-gfp-ub , and gfp-fyve-ubΔgg  also recruited eps <dig> to endosomes, as did slowing endosome maturation with constitutively-active rab5-q79l. endosomal recruitment required the uim domains, but not the n-terminal eh domains or central coiled-coil domains, of eps <dig>  silencing of the endosomal eps <dig> binding partner hrs did not affect recruitment of eps <dig> to ubiquitin-enriched endosomes. in fact, hrs silencing itself modestly recruited eps <dig> to endosomes, probably by accumulating endogenous ubiquitinated cargo. eps <dig> silencing did not affect lysosomal degradation of ubiquitinated erbb2; however, gfp-fyve-ubΔgg overexpression inhibited internalization of egfr and transferrin receptor.


CONCLUSIONS
we show for the first time that ubiquitin is sufficient for eps <dig> recruitment to endosomes. we speculate that eps <dig> recruitment to ubiquitin-rich endosomes may reduce the level of eps <dig> at the plasma membrane, slowing endocytosis to allow time for processing of ubiquitinated cargo in endosomes.
