BACKGROUND
pseudomonas fuscovaginae  is an emerging plant pathogen of rice and also of other gramineae plants. it causes sheath brown rot disease in rice with symptoms that are characterized by brown lesions on the flag leaf sheath, grain discoloration and sterility. it was first isolated as a high altitude pathogen in japan and has since been reported in several countries throughout the world. pfv is a broad host range pathogen and very little is known about its virulence mechanisms.


RESULTS
an in planta screen of  <dig> random independent tn <dig> genomic mutants resulted in the isolation of nine mutants which showed altered virulence. some of these isolates are mutated for functions which are known to be virulence associated factors in other phytopathogenic bacteria  and others might represent novel virulence loci.


CONCLUSIONS
being an emerging pathogen worldwide, the broad host range pathogen pfv has not yet been studied for its virulence functions. the roles of the nine loci identified in the in planta screen are discussed in relation to pathogenicity of pfv. in summary, this article reports a first study on the virulence of this pathogen involving in planta screening studies and suggests the presence of several virulence features with known and novel functions in the pseudomonas group of bacteria.
