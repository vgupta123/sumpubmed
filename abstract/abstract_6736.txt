BACKGROUND
the lgi <dig>  gene, a prime candidate for partial epilepsy with pericentral spikes, belongs to a family encoding secreted, beta-propeller domain proteins with eptp/ear epilepsy-associated repeats. in another family member, lgi <dig>  mutations are responsible for autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy . because a few lgi <dig> disease mutations described in the literature cause secretion failure, we experimentally analyzed the secretion efficiency and subcellular localization of several lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> mutant proteins corresponding to observed non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms  affecting the signal peptide, the leucine-rich repeats and the ear propeller.


RESULTS
mapping of disease-causing mutations in the ear domain region onto a 3d-structure model shows that many of these mutations co-localize at an evolutionary conserved surface region of the propeller. we find that wild-type lgi <dig> is secreted to the extracellular medium in glycosylated form similarly to lgi <dig>  whereas several mutant proteins tested in this study are secretion-deficient and accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum. interestingly, mutations at structurally homologous positions in the ear domain have the same effect on secretion in lgi <dig> and lgi <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this similarity of experimental mislocalization phenotypes for mutations at homologous positions of lgi <dig> and the established epilepsy gene lgi <dig> suggests that both genes share a potentially common molecular pathogenesis mechanism that might be the reason for genotypically distinct but phenotypically related forms of epilepsy.
