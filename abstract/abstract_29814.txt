BACKGROUND
a promoter capable of driving high-level transgene expression in oviduct cells is important for developing transgenic chickens capable of producing therapeutic proteins, including monoclonal antibodies , in the whites of laid eggs. ovalbumin promoters can be used as oviduct-specific regulatory sequences in transgenic chickens, but their promoter activities are not high, according to previous reports.


RESULTS
in this study, while using a previously characterized ovalbumin promoter, we attempted to improve the expression level of mabs using a cre/loxp-mediated conditional excision system. we constructed a therapeutic mab expression vector, pbs-ds-higg, driven by the cmv and cag promoters, in which the expression of the heavy and light chains of humanized immunoglobulin g  is preceded by two floxed stuffer reporter genes. in the presence of cre, the stuffer genes were precisely excised and higg expression was induced in pbs-ds-higg-transfected 293t cells. in chicken oviduct primary culture cells, higg was expressed after transfection of pbs-ds-higg together with the ovalbumin promoter-driven cre expression vector. the expression level of higg in these cells was increased 40-fold over that induced directly by the ovalbumin promoter. on the other hand, higg was not induced by the ovalbumin promoter-driven cre in chicken embryonic fibroblast cells.


CONCLUSIONS
the cre/loxp-based system could significantly increase ovalbumin promoter-driven production of proteins of interest, specifically in oviduct cells. this expression system could be useful for producing therapeutic mabs at high level using transgenic chickens as bioreactors.
