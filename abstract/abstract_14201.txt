BACKGROUND
the homeodomain transcription factor orthopedia  is essential in restricting the fate of multiple classes of secreting neurons in the neuroendocrine hypothalamus of vertebrates. however, there is little information on the intercellular factors that regulate otp expression during development.


RESULTS
here, we identified two otp orthologues in zebrafish  and explored otp <dig> in the context of the morphogenetic pathways that specify neuroectodermal regions. during forebrain development, otp <dig> is expressed in anterior groups of diencephalic cells, positioned in the preoptic area   and the posterior tuberculum  . the latter structure is characterized by tyrosine hydroxylase -positive cells, suggesting a role for otp <dig> in the lineage restriction of catecholaminergic  neurons. disruptions of hedgehog  and fibroblast growth factor  pathways point to the ability of shh protein to trigger otp <dig> expression in po presumptive neuroblasts, with the attenuating effect of dzip <dig> and fgf <dig>  in addition, our data disclose otp <dig> as a determinant of ca neurons in the pt, where otp <dig> activity is strictly dependent on nodal signaling and it is not responsive to shh and fgf.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we pinpoint the evolutionary importance of otp <dig> transcription factor in cell states of the diencephalon anlage and early neuronal progenitors. furthermore, our data indicate that morphogenetic mechanisms differentially regulate otp <dig> expression in alar and basal plates.
