BACKGROUND
rna interference  is a powerful method to inhibit gene expression in a sequence specific manner.


RESULTS
here, we described the development of rnai by micro-injection of double-stranded rna  in the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum. injection of dsrna into whole aphid body induced the silencing of two marker genes with different expression patterns: the ubiquitously expressed ap-crt genes encoding a calreticulin and the gut specific ap-cath-l gene encoding a cathepsin-l. time-course analysis of the silencing showed similar temporal patterns for both genes: inhibition started at  <dig> day after injection, reached its maximum at  <dig> days and stopped at  <dig> days. a comparable 40% decrease of gene expression was observed for ap-crt and ap-cath-l.


CONCLUSIONS
the pea aphid is the first hemipteran insect for which genome sequence will be available soon. the gene knockdown technique developed in this study will be an essential post-genomic tool for further investigations in aphidology.
