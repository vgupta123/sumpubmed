BACKGROUND
micrornas  play crucial roles in major biological processes and their deregulations are often associated with human malignancies. as such, they represent appealing candidates as targets of innovative therapies. another interesting aspect of their biology is that they are present in various biological fluids where, advantageously, they appear to be very stable. a plethora of studies have now reported their potential as biomarkers that can be used in diagnosis, prognosis and/or theranostic issues. however, the application of circulating mirnas in clinical practices still requires the identification of highly efficient, robust and reproducible methods for their isolation from biological samples.

in that context, we performed an independent cross-comparison of three commercially available rna extraction kits for mirnas isolation from human blood samples . mirnas were further profiled using the taqman low density array technology.


RESULTS
we found that, although these  <dig> kits had equal performances in extracting mirnas from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the macherey-nagel kit presented several advantages when isolating mirnas from sera. besides, our results have indicated that, depending on the quantity of the biological samples used, the extraction procedure directly impacted on the g/c composition of the mirnas detected.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, our study contributes to the definition of a reliable framework for profiling circulating mirnas.
