BACKGROUND
this study reports the identification of a full-length cdna sequence for two novel caprine prolactin-related proteins , and their localization and quantitative expression in the placenta. caprine prps are compared with known bovine prps. we examined their evolution and role in the ruminant placenta.


RESULTS
full-length cprp <dig> and cprp <dig> cdna were cloned with a 717- and 720- nucleotide open-reading frame corresponding to proteins of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids. the cprp <dig> predicted amino acid sequence shares a 72% homology with bovine prp <dig> . the cprp <dig> predicted amino acid sequence shares a 74% homology with bovine prp <dig> . the two cprps as well as bprps were detected only in the placentome by rt-pcr. analysis by in situ hybridization revealed the presence of both cprps mrna in the trophoblast binucleate cells. these mrna were quantified by real-time rt-pcr analysis of the placentome at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days of pregnancy. both new cprp genes were able to translate a mature protein in a mammalian cell-expression system. western blotting established the molecular sizes of  <dig> kda for cprp <dig> with flag-tag and  <dig> kda for cprp <dig> with flag-tag. the sequence properties and localized expression of cprp <dig> and cprp <dig> were similar to those of bovine. however, their expression profiles differed from those in bovine placenta. although this study demonstrated possible roles of prps in caprine placenta, prps may regulate binucleate-cell functions like those in bovine, but their crucial roles are still unclear.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified the novel prps in caprine placenta. localization and quantitative expression of caprine prps were compared with bovine prps. the data indicate that prp genes in caprine placenta have coordination functions for gestation, as they do in bovine. this is the first study of prps function in caprine placenta.
