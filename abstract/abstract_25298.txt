BACKGROUND
modern dog breeds display traits that are either breed-specific or shared by a few breeds as a result of genetic bottlenecks during the breed creation process and artificial selection for breed standards. selective sweeps in the genome result from strong selection and can be detected as a reduction or elimination of polymorphism in a given region of the genome.


RESULTS
extended regions of homozygosity, indicative of selective sweeps, were identified in a genome-wide scan dataset of  <dig> boxers from the united kingdom genotyped at ~ <dig>  single-nucleotide polymorphisms . these regions were further examined in a second dataset of boxers collected from a different geographical location and genotyped using higher density snp arrays . a selective sweep previously associated with canine brachycephaly was detected on chromosome  <dig>  a novel selective sweep of over  <dig> mb was observed on chromosome  <dig> in boxer and for a shorter region in english and french bulldogs. it was absent in  <dig> samples from eight other dog breeds and  <dig> iberian wolf samples. a region of extended increased heterozygosity on chromosome  <dig> overlapped with a previously reported copy number variant  which was polymorphic in multiple dog breeds.


CONCLUSIONS
a selective sweep of more than  <dig> mb on chromosome  <dig> was identified in the boxer genome. this sweep is likely caused by strong artificial selection for a trait of interest and could have inadvertently led to undesired health implications for this breed. furthermore, we provide supporting evidence for two previously described regions: a selective sweep on chromosome  <dig> associated with canine brachycephaly and a cnv on chromosome  <dig> polymorphic in multiple dog breeds.
