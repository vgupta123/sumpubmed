BACKGROUND
a capable expression vector is mainly characterized by its production efficiency, stability and induction response. these features can be influenced by a variation of modifications and versatile genetic modules.


RESULTS
we examined miscellaneous variations of a rhapbad expression vector. the introduction of a stem loop into the translation initiation region of the rhapbad promoter resulted in the most significant improvement of egfp expression. starting from this plasmid, we constructed a set of expression vectors bearing different genetic modules like rop, ccdab, cer and combinations thereof, and tested the efficiency of expression and plasmid stability. the plasmid pwa <dig>  containing the stem loop, one cer site and rop, attained high expression levels accompanied by a good stability, and on that score seems to be a well-balanced choice.


CONCLUSIONS
we report the generation of variations of the rhapbad expression vector and characterization hereof. the genetic modules showed a complex interplay, therefore two positive effects combined sometimes resulted in a disadvantage.
