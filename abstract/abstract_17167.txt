BACKGROUND
freshwater unionoidean bivalves, and species representing two marine bivalve orders , exhibit a mode of mtdna inheritance involving distinct maternal  and paternal  transmission routes concomitant with highly divergent gender-associated mtdna genomes. additionally, male unionoidean bivalves have a ~ <dig> bp 3' coding extension to the cox <dig> gene , that is apparently absent from all other metazoan taxa.


RESULTS
our molecular sequence analyses of mcox2e indicate that both the primary and secondary structures of the mcox2e region are evolving much faster than other regions of the f and m cox2-cox <dig> gene junction. the near n-terminus ~2/ <dig> of the mcox2e region contains an interspecifically variable number of predicted transmembrane helices  and interhelical loops  whereas the c-terminus ~1/ <dig> is relatively conserved and hydrophilic while containing conserved functional motifs. mcox2e displays an overall pattern of purifying selection that leads to the preservation of tmh/ihl and c-terminus tail sub-regions. however,  <dig> amino acid positions in the mcox2e tmh/ihl sub-region might be targeted by diversifying selection, each representing a site where there exists interspecific variation for the constituent amino acids residing in a tmh or ihl.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that mcox2e is unique to unionoidean bivalves, likely the result of a single insertion event that took place over  <dig> mya and that mcox2e is functional. the predicted tmh number, length and position variability likely stems from substitution-based processes rather than the typically implicated insertion/deletion events. mcox2e has relatively high rates of primary and secondary structure evolution, with some amino acid residues potentially subjected to site-specific positive selection, yet an overall pattern of purifying selection leading to the preservation of the tmh/ihl and hydrophilic c-terminus tail subregions. the more conserved c-terminus tail  is likely biologically active because it contains functional motifs. the rapid evolution of primary and secondary structure in mcox2e, combined with the action of both positive and purifying selection, provide supporting evidence for the hypothesis that mcox2e has a novel reproductive function within unionoidean bivalves. all tolled, our data indicate that unionoidean bivalve mcox <dig> is the first reported chimeric animal mtdna-encoded protein.
