BACKGROUND
dendritic cells  play a crucial role in initiating effective cell-mediated immune responses, but are dysfunctional and anergic in breast cancer. reversal of this dysfunction and establishment of optimal dc function is a key prerequisite for the induction of effective anti-cancer immune responses.


RESULTS
peripheral blood dcs  and lymph node dcs  generated in vitro from adherent cultures of peripheral blood monocytes  and lymph node monocytes , respectively, using the  <dig> cytokine conditioned medium   or  <dig> ccm  demonstrated a significantly higher degree of recovery and functional capacity in a mixed lymphocyte dc reaction , expressed significantly higher levels of hla-dr, cd <dig>  compared with  <dig> ccm  or medium alone generated dcs from pbms and lnms . the pbdcs generated with  <dig> ccm or  <dig> ccm showed a significantly  enhanced macropinocytotic capability  and induced increased production and secretion of interleukin-12p <dig>  in vitro , compared with pbdcs generated from monocytes using  <dig> ccm or medium alone. lipopolysaccharide  stimulation of pbdcs generated with  <dig> ccm demonstrated enhanced secretion of il- <dig> but not il-12p <dig>  compared with control dcs unstimulated with lps .


CONCLUSIONS
dysfunctional and anergic pbdcs and lndcs from patients with operable breast cancer can be optimally reversed by ex vivo culturing of precursor adherent monocytes using a  <dig> ccm containing ifn-α. maximal immunophenotypic recovery and functional reactivation of dcs is seen in the presence of ifn-α. however,  <dig> ccm containing ifn-α generated-pbdcs, do not produce and secrete il-12p <dig> in vitro.
