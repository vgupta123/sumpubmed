BACKGROUND
in mammalian cells, aspl is involved in insulin-stimulated redistribution of the glucose transporter glut <dig> and assembly of the golgi apparatus. its putative yeast orthologue, ubx <dig>  is important for proteasome localization, endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation , and uv-induced degradation of rna polymerase.


RESULTS
here, we show that aspl is a cofactor of the hexameric atpase complex, known as p <dig> or vcp in mammals and cdc <dig> in yeast. in addition, aspl interacts in vitro with nsf, another hexameric atpase complex. aspl localizes to the er membrane. the central area in aspl, containing both a shp box and a ubx domain, is required for binding to the p <dig> n-domain. knock-down of aspl does not impair degradation of misfolded secretory proteins via the erad pathway. deletion of ubx <dig> in yeast causes cycloheximide sensitivity, while ubx <dig> cdc48- <dig> double mutations cause proteasome mislocalization. aspl alleviates these defects, but not the impaired erad.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, aspl and ubx <dig> are homologous proteins with only partially overlapping functions. both interact with p97/cdc <dig>  but while ubx <dig> is important for erad, aspl appears not to share this function.
