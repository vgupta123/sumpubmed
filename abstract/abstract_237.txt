BACKGROUND
large collections of expressed sequence tags  are a fundamental resource for analysis of gene expression and annotation of genome sequences. we generated  <dig>  ests from  <dig> normalized and two non-normalized cdna libraries representing  <dig> tissues from tilapia, a cichlid fish widely used in aquaculture and biological research.


RESULTS
the ests were assembled into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons for a total of  <dig>  unique sequences and a total assembled length of  <dig> , <dig> bp. over the whole project, a unique sequence was discovered for every  <dig>  sequence reads.  <dig>   of these unique sequences had significant blast hits  to the uniprot database.


CONCLUSIONS
normalization of the cdna pools with double-stranded nuclease allowed us to efficiently sequence a large collection of ests. these sequences are an important resource for studies of gene expression, comparative mapping and annotation of the forthcoming tilapia genome sequence.
