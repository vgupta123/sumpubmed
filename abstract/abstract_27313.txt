BACKGROUND
the improvement of agricultural crops with regard to yield, resistance and environmental adaptation is a perpetual challenge for both breeding and research. exploration of the genetic potential and implementation of genome-based breeding strategies for efficient rye  cultivar improvement have been hampered by the lack of genome sequence information. to overcome this limitation we sequenced the transcriptomes of five winter rye inbred lines using roche/ <dig> gs flx technology.


RESULTS
more than  <dig>  million reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs representing a comprehensive rye expressed sequence tag  resource. from sequence comparisons  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  were identified to develop the rye5k high-throughput snp genotyping array. performance of the rye5k snp array was investigated by genotyping  <dig> rye inbred lines including the five lines used for sequencing, and five barley, three wheat, and two triticale accessions. a balanced distribution of allele frequencies ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  was observed. residual heterozygosity of the rye inbred lines varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> % with higher average heterozygosity in the pollen compared to the seed parent pool.


CONCLUSIONS
the established sequence and molecular marker resources will improve and promote genetic and genomic research as well as genome-based breeding in rye.
