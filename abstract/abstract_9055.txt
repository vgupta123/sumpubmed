BACKGROUND
recovery growth is a phase of rapid growth that is triggered by adequate refeeding of animals following a period of weight loss caused by starvation. in this study, to obtain more information on the system-wide integration of recovery growth in muscle, we undertook a time-course analysis of transcript expression in trout subjected to a food deprivation-refeeding sequence. for this purpose complex targets produced from muscle of trout fasted for one month and from muscle of trout fasted for one month and then refed for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days were hybridized to cdna microarrays containing  <dig> clones.


RESULTS
significance analysis of microarrays  and temporal expression profiling led to the segregation of differentially expressed genes into four major clusters. one cluster comprising  <dig> genes with high expression in muscle from fasted animals included a large set of genes involved in protein catabolism. a second cluster that included approximately  <dig> genes with transient induction  <dig> to  <dig> days post-refeeding was dominated by genes involved in transcription, ribosomal biogenesis, translation, chaperone activity, mitochondrial production of atp and cell division. a third cluster that contained  <dig> genes that were up-regulated  <dig> to  <dig> days post-refeeding was enriched with genes involved in reticulum and golgi dynamics and with genes indicative of myofiber and muscle remodelling such as genes encoding sarcomeric proteins and matrix compounds. finally, a fourth cluster of  <dig> genes overexpressed only in 36-day refed trout muscle contained genes with function in carbohydrate metabolism and lipid biosynthesis. remarkably, among the genes induced were several transcriptional regulators which might be important for the gene-specific transcriptional adaptations that underlie muscle recovery.


CONCLUSIONS
our study is the first demonstration of a coordinated expression of functionally related genes during muscle recovery growth. furthermore, the generation of a useful database of novel genes associated with muscle recovery growth will allow further investigations on particular genes, pathways or cellular process involved in muscle growth and regeneration.
