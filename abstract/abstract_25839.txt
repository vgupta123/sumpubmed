BACKGROUND
neurotrophins and their receptors are key molecules in the regulation of neuronal differentiation and survival. they mediate the survival of neurons during development and adulthood and are implicated in synaptic plasticity. the human neurotrophin- <dig> receptor gene ntrk <dig> yields two major isoforms, a full-length kinase-active form and a truncated non-catalytic form, which activates a specific pathway affecting membrane remodeling and cytoskeletal reorganization. the two variants present non-overlapping 3'utrs, indicating that they might be differentially regulated at the post-transcriptional level. here, we provide evidence that the two isoforms of ntrk <dig> are targeted by different sets of micrornas, small non-coding rnas that play an important regulatory role in the nervous system.


RESULTS
we identify one microrna  that represses the full-length isoform of ntrk <dig> and four micrornas  that repress the truncated isoform. in particular, we show that the overexpression of mir- <dig> - a brain enriched mirna - causes morphological changes in sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells similar to those observed using an sirna specifically directed against truncated ntrk <dig>  as well as a significant increase in cell number. accordingly, transcriptome analysis of cells transfected with mir- <dig> revealed an alteration of the expression of genes implicated in cytoskeletal organization as well as genes involved in apoptosis, cell survival and proliferation, including the anti-apoptotic factor bcl <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the regulation of ntrk <dig> by micrornas is isoform-specific and suggest that neurotrophin-mediated processes are strongly linked to microrna-dependent mechanisms. in addition, these findings open new perspectives for the study of the physiological role of mir- <dig> and its possible involvement in cell death/survival processes.
