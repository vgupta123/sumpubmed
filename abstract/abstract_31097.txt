BACKGROUND
bloodstream infections represent serious conditions carrying a high mortality and morbidity rate. rapid identification of microorganisms and prompt institution of adequate antimicrobial therapy is of utmost importance for a successful outcome. aiming at the development of a rapid, simplified and efficient protocol, we developed and compared two in-house preparatory methods for the direct identification of bacteria from positive blood culture flasks  by using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry .

both methods employed saponin and distilled water for erythrocyte lysis. in method a the cellular pellet was overlaid with formic acid on the maldi tof target plate for protein extraction, whereas in method b the pellet was exposed to formic acid followed by acetonitrile prior to placing on the target plate.


RESULTS
best results were obtained by method a. direct identification was achieved for  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %  of organisms by method a and method b, respectively. overall concordance with final identification was 100 % to genus and  <dig>  % to species level. by applying a lower cut-off score value, the levels of identification obtained by method a and method b increased to  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of organisms , respectively. using the lowered score criteria, concordance with final results was obtained for  <dig>  % of genus and  <dig>  % of species identifications.


CONCLUSIONS
the reliability of results, rapid performance  and applicability of in-house method a have contributed to implementation of this robust and cost-effective method in our laboratory.
