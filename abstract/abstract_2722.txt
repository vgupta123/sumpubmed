BACKGROUND
how epithelial cells adopt their particular polarised forms is poorly understood. in a screen for genes regulating epithelial morphology in drosophila, we identified sds <dig>  a conserved gene previously characterised in yeast.


RESULTS
in the columnar epithelia of imaginal discs or follicle cells, mutation of sds <dig> causes contraction of cells along their apical-basal axis, resulting in a more cuboidal morphology. in addition, the mutant cells can also display altered cell polarity, forming multiple layers in follicle cells and leaving the epithelium in imaginal discs. in yeast, sds <dig> encodes a pp <dig> phosphatase regulatory subunit. consistent with this, we show that drosophila sds <dig> binds to all four drosophila pp1s and shares an overlapping phenotype with pp1beta9c. we also show that two previously postulated pp <dig> targets, spaghetti squash and moesin are hyper-phosphorylated in sds <dig> mutants. this function is shared by the human homologue of sds <dig>  ppp1r <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
sds <dig> is a conserved pp <dig> phosphatase regulatory subunit that controls cell shape and polarity.
