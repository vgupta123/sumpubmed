BACKGROUND
the distance matrix computed from multiple alignments of homologous sequences is widely used by distance-based phylogenetic methods to provide information on the evolution of protein families. this matrix can also be visualized in a low dimensional space by metric multidimensional scaling . applied to protein families, mds provides information complementary to the information derived from tree-based methods. moreover, mds gives a unique opportunity to compare orthologous sequence sets because it can add supplementary elements to a reference space.


RESULTS
the r package bios2mds  has been designed to analyze multiple sequence alignments by mds. bios2mds starts with a sequence alignment, builds a matrix of distances between the aligned sequences, and represents this matrix by mds to visualize a sequence space. this package also offers the possibility of performing k-means clustering in the mds derived sequence space. most importantly, bios2mds includes a function that projects supplementary elements  onto the space defined by reference or “active” elements. orthologous sequence sets can thus be compared in a straightforward way. the data analysis and visualization tools have been specifically designed for an easy monitoring of the evolutionary drift of protein sub-families.


CONCLUSIONS
the bios2mds package provides the tools for a complete integrated pipeline aimed at the mds analysis of multiple sets of orthologous sequences in the r statistical environment. in addition, as the analysis can be carried out from user provided matrices, the projection function can be widely used on any kind of data.
