BACKGROUND
characterizing the nuclear orientation of chromosomes in the three-dimensional  nucleus by multicolor banding  is a new approach towards understanding nuclear organization of chromosome territories. an mbanding paint is composed of multiple overlapping subchromosomal probes that represent different regions of a single chromosome. in this study, we used it for the analysis of chromosome orientation in 3d interphase nuclei. we determined whether the nuclear orientation of the two chromosome  <dig> homologs was random or preferential, and if it was conserved between diploid mouse pre b lymphocytes of balb/c origin and primary b lymphocytes of congenic n wild-type mice. the chromosome orientation was assessed visually and through a semi-automated quantitative analysis of the radial and angular orientation patterns observed in both b cell types.


RESULTS
our data indicate that there are different preferential patterns of chromosome  <dig> orientation, which are not significantly different between both mouse cell types . in the most common case for both cell types, both copies of chromosome  <dig> were oriented in parallel with the nuclear border. the second most common pattern in both types of b lymphocytes was with one homolog of chromosome  <dig> positioned with its telomeric end towards the nuclear center and with its centromeric end towards the periphery, while the other chromosome  <dig> was found parallel with the nuclear border. in addition to these two most common orientations present in approximately 50% of nuclei from each cell type, other orientations were observed at lower frequencies.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that there are probabilistic, non-random orientation patterns for mouse chromosome  <dig> in the mouse b lymphocytes we investigated .
