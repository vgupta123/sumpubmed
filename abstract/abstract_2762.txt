BACKGROUND
limited dna sequence and dna marker resources have been developed for iris , a monocot genus of 200– <dig> species in the asparagales, several of which are horticulturally important. we mined an i. brevicaulis-i. fulva est database for simple sequence repeats  and developed ortholog-specific est-ssr markers for genetic mapping and other genotyping applications in iris. here, we describe the abundance and other characteristics of ssrs identified in the transcript assembly  and the cross-species utility and polymorphisms of i. brevicaulis-i. fulva est-ssr markers among wild collected ecotypes and horticulturally important cultivars.


RESULTS
collectively,  <dig>  ests were produced from normalized leaf and root cdna libraries of i. brevicaulis  and i. fulva , and assembled into  <dig>  unigenes . we identified  <dig>  ssrs in  <dig>  unigenes and developed  <dig> est-ssr markers, each tracing a different unigene. three-fourths of the est-ssr markers  amplified alleles from ib <dig> and if <dig> and 84%  were polymorphic between ib <dig> and if <dig>  the parents of i. brevicaulis × i. fulva mapping populations. forty est-ssr markers were screened for polymorphisms among  <dig> ecotypes or cultivars of seven species – 100% amplified alleles from wild collected ecotypes of louisiana iris , whereas 42–52% amplified alleles from cultivars of three horticulturally important species . ecotypes and cultivars were genetically diverse – the number of alleles/locus ranged from two to  <dig> and mean heterozygosity was  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
nearly  <dig> ortholog-specific est-ssr markers were developed for comparative genetic mapping and other genotyping applications in iris, were highly polymorphic among ecotypes and cultivars, and have broad utility for genotyping applications within the genus.
