BACKGROUND
spinal muscular atrophy  is the leading genetic cause of infantile death. it is caused by the loss of functional survival motor neuron  <dig> . there is a nearly identical copy gene, smn <dig>  but it is unable to rescue from disease due to an alternative splicing event that excises a necessary exon  from the majority of smn2-derived transcripts. while smnΔ <dig> protein has severely reduced functionality, the exon  <dig> sequences may not be specifically required for all activities. therefore, aminoglycoside antibiotics previously shown to suppress stop codon recognition and promote translation read-through have been examined to increase the length of the smnΔ <dig> c-terminus.


RESULTS
here we demonstrate that subcutaneous-administration of a read-through inducing compound  to an intermediate sma model  had beneficial effects on muscle fiber size and gross motor function.


CONCLUSIONS
delivery of the read-through inducing compound tc <dig> reduces the disease-associated phenotype in sma mice, however, does not significantly extend survival.
