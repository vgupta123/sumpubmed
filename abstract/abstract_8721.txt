BACKGROUND
post-translational modification of histones resulting in chromatin remodelling plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression. here we report characteristic patterns of expression of  <dig> members of  <dig> classes of chromatin modifier genes in  <dig> different cancer types: histone acetyltransferases - ep <dig>  crebbp, and pcaf; histone deacetylases - hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  hdac7a, and sirt1; and histone methyltransferases - suv39h1and suv39h <dig>  expression of each gene in  <dig> samples  was analysedby qrt-pcr, normalized with  <dig> housekeeping genes, and given as a ratio by comparison with a universal reference rna.


RESULTS
this involved a total of  <dig>  pcr assays allowing for rigorous analysis by fitting a linear regression model to the data. mutation analysis of hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  suv39h <dig>  and suv39h <dig> revealed only two out of  <dig> cancer samples  with significant coding-sequence alterations. supervised analysis and independent component analysis showed that expression of many of these genes was able to discriminate tumour samples from their normal counterparts. clustering based on the normalized expression ratios of the  <dig> genes also showed that most samples were grouped according to tissue type. using a linear discriminant classifier and internal cross-validation revealed that with as few as  <dig> of the  <dig> genes, sirt <dig>  crebbp, hdac7a, hdac <dig> and pcaf, most samples were correctly assigned.


CONCLUSIONS
the expression patterns of hats, hdacs, and hmts suggest these genes are important in neoplastic transformation and have characteristic patterns of expression depending on tissue of origin, with implications for potential clinical application.
