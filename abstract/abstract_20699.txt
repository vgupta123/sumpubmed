BACKGROUND
our objective was to discover in silico axioms that are plausible representations of the operating principles realized during characteristic growth of emt6/ro mouse mammary tumor spheroids in culture. to reach that objective we engineered and iteratively falsified an agent-based analogue of emt <dig> spheroid growth. emt <dig> spheroids display consistent and predictable growth characteristics, implying that individual cell behaviors are tightly controlled and regulated. an approach to understanding how individual cell behaviors contribute to system behaviors is to discover a set of principles that enable abstract agents to exhibit closely analogous behaviors using only information available in an agent's immediate environment. we listed key attributes of emt <dig> spheroid growth, which became our behavioral targets. included were the development of a necrotic core surrounded by quiescent and proliferating cells, and growth data at two distinct levels of nutrient.


RESULTS
we then created an analogue made up of quasi-autonomous software agents and an abstract environment in which they could operate. the system was designed so that upon execution it could mimic emt <dig> cells forming spheroids in culture. each agent used an identical set of axiomatic operating principles. in sequence, we used the list of targeted attributes to falsify and revise these axioms, until the analogue exhibited behaviors and attributes that were within prespecified ranges of those targeted, thereby achieving a level of validation.


CONCLUSIONS
the finalized analogue required nine axioms. we posit that the validated analogue's operating principles are reasonable representations of those utilized by emt6/ro cells during tumor spheroid development.
