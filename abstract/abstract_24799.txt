BACKGROUND
myostatin  and growth/differentiation factor  <dig>  are highly related transforming growth factor Î²  family members that play important roles in regulating embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. despite their high degree of sequence identity, targeted mutations in these genes result in non-overlapping phenotypes affecting distinct biological processes. loss of mstn in mice causes a doubling of skeletal muscle mass while loss of gdf <dig> in mice causes dramatic anterior homeotic transformations of the axial skeleton, kidney agenesis, and an increase in progenitor cell number in several tissues. in order to investigate the possible functional redundancy of myostatin and gdf <dig>  we analyzed the effect of eliminating the functions of both of these signaling molecules.


RESULTS
we show that mstn-/- gdf11-/- mice have more extensive homeotic transformations of the axial skeleton than gdf11-/- mice in addition to skeletal defects not seen in single mutants such as extra forelimbs. we also show that deletion of gdf <dig> specifically in skeletal muscle in either mstn+/+ or mstn-/- mice does not affect muscle size, fiber number, or fiber type.


CONCLUSIONS
these results provide evidence that myostatin and gdf <dig> have redundant functions in regulating skeletal patterning in mice but most likely not in regulating muscle size.
