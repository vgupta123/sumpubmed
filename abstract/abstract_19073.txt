BACKGROUND
coliform bacteria are the most common etiologic agents in severe mastitis of cows. escherichia coli infections are mostly restricted to a single udder quarter whereas neighboring quarters stay clinically inapparent, implicating the presence of a systemic defense reaction. to address its underlying mechanism, we performed a transcriptome study of mammary tissue from udder quarters inoculated with e. coli , from neighboring quarters of the same animals, and from untreated control animals.


RESULTS
after  <dig> h  <dig> probe sets of differentially expressed genes  were detected in infected quarters versus control animals. eighteen hours later  <dig> and  <dig> deg were found in infected and in neighboring quarters vs. control animals. cluster analysis revealed deg found only in infected quarters  and deg detected in both infected and neighboring quarters . the first group includes genes mainly involved in immune response and inflammation, while the systemic reaction comprises antigen processing and presentation, cytokines, protein degradation and apoptosis. enhanced expression of antimicrobial genes , acute phase genes , and indicators of oxidative stress  point to an active defense reaction in infected and neighboring healthy quarters. its early onset is indicated by increased transcription of nfil <dig> at  <dig> h. nfil <dig> is a predicted regulator of many genes of the systemic response at  <dig> h. the significance of our transcriptome study was evidenced by some recent findings with candidate gene based approaches.


CONCLUSIONS
the discovery and holistic analysis of an extensive systemic reaction in the mammary gland significantly expands the knowledge of host-pathogen interactions in mastitis which may be relevant for the development of novel therapies and for genetic selection towards mastitis resistance.
