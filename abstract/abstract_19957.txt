BACKGROUND
in view of the global increase in diabetes, and the fact that recent findings indicate that diabetic neuropathy is more frequently seen in males, it is crucial to evaluate any gender differences in nerve regeneration in diabetes. our aim was to evaluate in short-term experiments gender dissimilarities in axonal outgrowth in healthy and in genetically developed type  <dig> diabetic goto-kakizaki  rats, and also to investigate the connection between activated  and apoptotic  schwann cells after sciatic nerve injury and repair. female and male diabetic gk rats, spontaneously developing type  <dig> diabetes, were compared with corresponding healthy wistar rats. the sciatic nerve was transected and instantly repaired. after six days the nerve was harvested to measure axonal outgrowth , and to quantify the number of atf- <dig>  and cleaved caspase  <dig>  stained schwann cells using immunohistochemistry.


RESULTS
axonal outgrowth was generally longer in male than in female rats and also longer in healthy than in diabetic rats. differences were observed in the number of activated schwann cells both in the distal nerve segment and close to the lesion site. in particular the female diabetic rats had a lower number. there were no gender differences in number of cleaved caspase  <dig> stained schwann cells, but rats with diabetes exhibited more  cells both at the lesion site and in the distal part of the sciatic nerve. axonal outgrowth correlated with the number of atf <dig> stained schwann cells, but not with blood glucose levels or the cleaved caspase  <dig> stained schwann cells. however, the number of cleaved caspase  <dig> stained schwann cells correlated with the blood glucose level.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that there are gender differences in nerve regeneration in healthy rats and in type  <dig> diabetic gk rats.
