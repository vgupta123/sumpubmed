BACKGROUND
comparative sequence analysis is an effective and increasingly common way to identify cis-regulatory regions in animal genomes.


RESULTS
we describe three tools for comparative analysis of pairs of bac-sized genomic regions. paircomp is a tool that does windowed  comparisons of two sequences and reports all matches above a set threshold. familyrelationsii is a graphical viewer for comparisons that enables interactive exploration of several different kinds of comparisons. cartwheel is a web site and compute-cluster management system used to execute and store comparisons for display by familyrelationsii. these tools are specialized for the discovery of cis-regulatory regions in animal genomes. all tools and their source code are freely available at .


CONCLUSIONS
these tools have been shown to effectively identify regulatory regions in echinoderms, mammals, and nematodes.
