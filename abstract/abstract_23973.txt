BACKGROUND
understanding of the genetic architecture of plant uv-b responses allows extensive targeted testing of candidate genes or regions, along with combinations of those genes, for placement in metabolic or signal transduction pathways.


RESULTS
composite interval mapping and single-marker analysis methods were used to identify significant loci for cotyledon opening under uv-b in four sets of recombinant inbred lines. in addition, loci important for canalization  of cotyledon opening were detected in two mapping populations. one candidate locus contained the gene hy <dig>  mutant analysis demonstrated that hy <dig> was required for uv-b-specific cotyledon opening.


CONCLUSIONS
structured mapping populations provide key information on the degree of complexity in the genetic control of uv-b-induced cotyledon opening in arabidopsis. the loci identified using quantitative trait analysis methods are useful for follow-up testing of candidate genes.
