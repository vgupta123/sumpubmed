BACKGROUND
the effect of physical and chemical permeation enhancers on in vitro transdermal permeation of lidocaine was investigated in the horse.

therefore, the effect of six vehicles , 50% ethanol, 50% propylene glycol, 50% isopropylalcohol, 50% isopropylalcohol/isopropylmyristate and 50% dimethylsulfoxide) was examined as well as the effect of microneedle pretreatment with different needle lengths on transdermal drug delivery of lidocaine.

the skin was obtained from the thorax of six warmblood horses and was stored up to two weeks at - 20°c. franz-type diffusion cells were used to study the transdermal permeation through split skin . the amount of lidocaine in the receptor fluid was determined by uv–vis high-performance liquid chromatography.


RESULTS
all investigated vehicle supplementations diminished the transdermal flux of lidocaine through equine skin in comparison to pure pbs except dimethylsulfoxide, which resulted in comparable permeation rates to pbs. the maximum flux  was  <dig> - <dig>  fold lower for lidocaine applied in 50% ethanol, propylene glycol, isopropylalcohol and isopropylalcohol/isopropylmyristate. a significant higher jmax of lidocaine was observed when lidocaine was applied in pbs onto microneedle pretreated skin with similar permeation rates in both needle lengths. after 6 hours,  <dig>  fold higher recovery rates were observed in the microneedle pretreated skin samples than in the untreated control samples. the lagtimes were reduced to 20–50% in the microneedle pretreated skin samples.


CONCLUSIONS
microneedles represent a promising tool for transdermal lidocaine application in the horse with a rapid systemic bioavailability.
