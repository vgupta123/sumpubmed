BACKGROUND
fibrates are a unique hypolipidemic drugs that lower plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels through their action as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha  agonists. the activation of pparα leads to a cascade of events that result in the pharmacological  and adverse  effects in rodent liver.


RESULTS
to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the pleiotropic effects of pparα agonists, we treated mouse primary hepatocytes with three pparα agonists  at multiple concentrations  for  <dig> hours. when primary hepatocytes were exposed to these agents, transactivation of pparα was elevated as measured by luciferase assay. global gene expression profiles in response to pparα agonists were obtained by microarray analysis. among differentially expressed genes , there were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes commonly regulated by bezafibrate, fenofibrate, and wy- <dig>  treatments across  <dig> doses, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner. treatments with  <dig> μm of bezafibrate, fenofibrate, and wy- <dig>  resulted in  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes altered, respectively. among them,  <dig> genes were commonly regulated by at least two drugs. many genes are involved in fatty acid metabolism including oxidative reaction. some of the gene changes were associated with production of reactive oxygen species, cell proliferation of peroxisomes, and hepatic disorders. in addition,  <dig> genes related to the development of liver cancer were observed.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that treatment of pparα agonists results in the production of oxidative stress and increased peroxisome proliferation, thus providing a better understanding of mechanisms underlying pparα agonist-induced hepatic disorders and hepatocarcinomas.
