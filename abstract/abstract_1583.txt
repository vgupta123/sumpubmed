BACKGROUND
iron-deficiency leads to the induction of genes related to intestinal iron absorption and homeostasis. by analyzing a large genechip® dataset from the rat intestine, we identified a large cluster of  <dig> genes that was induced by iron-deprivation. only  <dig> of these genes contained 3' iron-response elements, suggesting that other regulation including transcriptional may be involved. we therefore utilized computational methods to test the hypothesis that some of the genes within this large up-regulated cluster are co-ordinately regulated by common transcriptional mechanisms. we thus identified promoters from the up-regulated gene cluster from rat, mouse and human, and performed enrichment analyses with the clover program and the transfac database.


RESULTS
surprisingly, we found a strong statistical enrichment for sp <dig> binding sites in our experimental promoters as compared to background sequences. as the transfac database cannot distinguish among sp/klf family members, many of which bind similar gc-rich dna sequences, we surmise that sp <dig> or an sp1-like factor could be involved in this response. in fact, we detected induction of sp6/klf <dig> in the genechip® studies, and confirmed it by real-time pcr. additional computational analyses suggested that an sp1-like factor may function synergistically with a fox tf to regulate a subset of these genes. furthermore, analysis of promoter sequences identified many genes with multiple, conserved sp <dig> and fox binding sites, the relative location of which within orthologous promoters was highly conserved.


CONCLUSIONS
sp <dig> or a closely related factor may play a primary role in the genetic response to iron-deficiency in the mammalian intestine.
