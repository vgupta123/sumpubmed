BACKGROUND
because the floral induction occurs in many plants when specific environmental conditions are satisfied, most plants bloom and bear fruit during the same season each year. in fig, by contrast, the time interval during which inflorescence  differentiation occurs corresponds to the shoot elongation period. fig trees thus differ from many species in their reproductive growth characteristics. to date, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this unorthodox physiology of floral induction and fruit setting in fig trees have not been elucidated.


RESULTS
we isolated a flowering locus t -like gene from fig and examined its function, characteristics, and expression patterns. the isolated gene, f. carica ft , is single copy in fig and shows the highest similarity at the amino acid level  to apple mdft <dig>  we sequenced its upstream region  and identified many light-responsive elements. fcft <dig> was mainly expressed in leaves and induced early flowering in transgenic tobacco, suggesting that fcft <dig> is a fig ft ortholog. real-time reverse-transcription pcr analysis revealed that fcft <dig> mrna expression occurred only in leaves at the lower nodes, the early fruit setting positions. mrna levels remained a constant for approximately 5 months from spring to autumn, corresponding almost exactly to the inflorescence differentiation season. diurnal variation analysis revealed that fcft <dig> mrna expression increased under relative long-day and short-day conditions, but not under continuous darkness.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that fcft <dig> activation is regulated by light conditions and may contribute to fig’s unique fruit-setting characteristics.
