BACKGROUND
accurate somatic mutation-calling is essential for insightful mutation analyses in cancer studies. several mutation-callers are publicly available and more are likely to appear. nonetheless, mutation-calling is still challenging and there is unlikely to be one established caller that systematically outperforms all others. therefore, fully utilizing multiple callers can be a powerful way to construct a list of final calls for oneâ€™s research.


RESULTS
using a set of mutations from multiple callers that are impartially validated, we present a statistical approach for building a combined caller, which can be applied to combine calls in a wider dataset generated using a similar protocol. using the mutation outputs and the validation data from the cancer genome atlas endometrial study , we demonstrate how to build a statistical model that predicts the probability of each call being a somatic mutation, based on the detection status of multiple callers and a few associated features.


CONCLUSIONS
the approach allows us to build a combined caller across the full range of stringency levels, which outperforms all of the individual callers.
