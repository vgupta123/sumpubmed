BACKGROUND
chimeric read-through rnas are transcripts originating from two directly adjacent genes  on the same dna strand. although they are found in next-generation whole transcriptome sequencing  data on a regular basis, investigating them further has usually been refrained from. therefore, their expression patterns or functions in general, and in oncogenesis in particular, are poorly understood.


RESULTS
we used paired-end rna-seq and a specifically designed computational data analysis pipeline  to nominate read-through events in a small discovery set of renal cell carcinomas  and confirmed them in a larger validation cohort.

 <dig> read-through events were called overall; 22/ <dig>  selected nominees passed validation with conventional pcr and were sequenced at the junction region. we frequently identified various isoforms of a given read-through event. 2/ <dig> read-throughs were up-regulated: bc039389-gatm was higher expressed in rcc compared to benign adjacent kidney; klk4-krsp <dig> was expressed in 46/ <dig>  rccs, but rarely in normal tissue. klk4-krsp <dig> expression was associated with worse clinical outcome in the patient cohort. in cell lines, both read-throughs influenced molecular mechanisms  in a way that counteracted the effect of the respective parent transcript gatm or klk <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggests that the up-regulation of read-through rna chimeras in tumors is not random but causes regulatory effects on cellular mechanisms and may impact patient survival.
