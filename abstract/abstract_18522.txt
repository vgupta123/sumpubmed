BACKGROUND
phosphatase of regenerating liver- <dig>  has been implicated in controlling cancer cell proliferation, motility, metastasis, and angiogenesis. deregulated expression of prl- <dig> is highly correlated with cancer progression and predicts poor survival. although prl- <dig> was categorized as a tyrosine phosphatase, its cellular substrates remain largely unknown.


RESULTS
we demonstrated that prl- <dig> interacts with integrin β <dig> in cancer cells. recombinant prl- <dig> associates with the intracellular domain of integrin β <dig> in vitro. silencing of integrin α <dig> enhances prl-3-integrin β <dig> interaction. furthermore, prl- <dig> diminishes tyrosine phosphorylation of integrin β <dig> in vitro and in vivo. with site-specific anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies against residues in the intracellular domain of integrin β <dig>  tyrosine- <dig>  but not tyrosine- <dig>  is shown to be dephosphorylated by prl- <dig> in a catalytic activity-dependant manner. phosphorylation of y <dig> is potentiated by ablation of prl- <dig> or by treatment with a chemical inhibitor of prl- <dig>  conversely, depletion of integrin α <dig> decreases the phosphorylation of this site.


CONCLUSIONS
our results revealed a direct interaction between prl- <dig> and integrin β <dig> and characterized y <dig> of integrin β <dig> as a bona fide substrate of prl- <dig>  which is negatively regulated by integrin α <dig>
