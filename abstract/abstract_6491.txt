BACKGROUND
cotton is the worldâ€™s most important natural textile fiber and a significant oilseed crop. decoding cotton genomes will provide the ultimate reference and resource for research and utilization of the species. integration of high-density genetic maps with genomic sequence information will largely accelerate the process of whole-genome assembly in cotton.


RESULTS
in this paper, we update a high-density interspecific genetic linkage map of allotetraploid cultivated cotton. an additional  <dig>  marker loci have been added to our previously published map of  <dig>  loci. three new marker types, indel  and snp  developed from gene information, and remap , were used to increase map density. the updated map consists of  <dig>  loci in  <dig> linkage groups covering  <dig> . <dig> cm with an average inter-locus distance of  <dig>  cm. furthermore, genome-wide sequence analysis was finished using  <dig>  informative sequence-based markers and publicly-available gossypium dna sequence information. a total of  <dig>  est and  <dig> bac sequences were physically anchored and clustered by  <dig>  sequence-based markers. of these,  <dig>  ests and  <dig> bacs from different species of gossypium were clustered and specifically anchored to the high-density genetic map. a total of  <dig>  candidate unigenes from  <dig>  ests clusters and  <dig> bacs were mined for functional annotation and classification. the  <dig> ests/genes related to fiber quality traits were integrated with  <dig> previously reported cotton fiber quality quantitative trait loci, which demonstrated the important roles in fiber quality of these genes. higher-level sequence conservation between different cotton species and between the a- and d-subgenomes in tetraploid cotton was found, indicating a common evolutionary origin for orthologous and paralogous loci in gossypium.


CONCLUSIONS
this study will serve as a valuable genomic resource for tetraploid cotton genome assembly, for cloning genes related to superior agronomic traits, and for further comparative genomic analyses in gossypium.
