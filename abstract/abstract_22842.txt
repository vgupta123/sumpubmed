BACKGROUND
knowing the submitochondria localization of a mitochondria protein is an important step to understand its function. we develop a method which is based on an extended version of pseudo-amino acid composition to predict the protein localization within mitochondria. this work goes one step further than predicting protein subcellular location. we also try to predict the membrane protein type for mitochondrial inner membrane proteins.


RESULTS
by using leave-one-out cross validation, the prediction accuracy is  <dig> % for inner membrane,  <dig> % for matrix and  <dig> % for outer membrane. the overall prediction accuracy for submitochondria location prediction is  <dig> %. for proteins predicted to localize at inner membrane, the accuracy is  <dig> % for membrane protein type prediction.


CONCLUSIONS
our method is an effective method for predicting protein submitochondria location. but even with our method or the methods at subcellular level, the prediction of protein submitochondria location is still a challenging problem. the online service submito is now available at:
