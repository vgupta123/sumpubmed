BACKGROUND
isoflavonoids are a class of specialized metabolites found predominantly in legumes. they play a role in signaling for symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria and inhibiting pathogen infection.


RESULTS
a transcriptomic approach using soybean cultivars with high  and low  root isoflavonoid content was used to find elements that underlie this variation. two genes, encoding the flavonoid-metabolizing enzymes, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase  and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase , had lower expression levels in high isoflavonoid cultivars. these enzymes compete with isoflavonoid biosynthetic enzymes for the important branch-point substrate naringenin and its derivatives. differentially expressed genes, between the two sets of cultivars, encode transcription factors, transporters and enzymatic families of interest, such as oxidoreductases, hydrolases and transferases. in addition, genes annotated with stress and disease response were upregulated in high isoflavonoid cultivars.


CONCLUSIONS
coordinated regulation of genes involved in flavonoid metabolism could redirect flux into the isoflavonoid branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway, by reducing competition for the flavanone substrate. these candidate genes could help identify mechanisms to overcome the endogenous bottleneck to isoflavonoid production, facilitate biosynthesis in heterologous systems, and enhance crop resistance against pathogenic infections.
