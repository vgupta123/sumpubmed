BACKGROUND
the amount of data deposited in the gene expression omnibus  has expanded significantly. it is important to ensure that these data are properly annotated with clinical data and descriptions of experimental conditions so that they can be useful for future analysis. this study assesses the adequacy of documented asthma markers in geo. three objective measures  were used for evaluation of annotations contained in  <dig> asthma studies.


RESULTS
there were  <dig> asthma samples with  <dig>  annotated markers. of these markers, only  <dig>  had documented values . in one study carefully examined for consistency, there were discrepancies in drug name usage, with brand name and generic name used in different sections to refer to the same drug. annotated markers showed adequate association with other relevant variables .


CONCLUSIONS
there is inadequate variable coverage within geo and usage of terms lacks consistency. association between relevant variables, however, was adequate.
