BACKGROUND
β-catenin plays a central role in multiple developmental processes. however, it has been difficult to study its pleiotropic effects, because of the dual capacity of β-catenin to coordinate cadherin-dependent cell adhesion and to act as a component of wnt signal transduction. to distinguish between the divergent functions of β-catenin during peripheral nervous system development, we made use of a mutant allele of β-catenin that can mediate adhesion but not wnt-induced tcf transcriptional activation. this allele was combined with various conditional inactivation approaches.


RESULTS
we show that of all peripheral nervous system structures, only sensory dorsal root ganglia require β-catenin for proper formation and growth. surprisingly, however, dorsal root ganglia development is independent of cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. rather, both progenitor cell proliferation and fate specification are controlled by β-catenin signaling. these can be divided into temporally sequential processes, each of which depends on a different function of β-catenin.


CONCLUSIONS
while early stage proliferation and specific neurog2- and krox20-dependent waves of neuronal subtype specification involve activation of tcf transcription, late stage progenitor proliferation and neurog1-marked sensory neurogenesis are regulated by a function of β-catenin independent of tcf activation and adhesion. thus, switching modes of β-catenin function are associated with consecutive cell fate specification and stage-specific progenitor proliferation.
