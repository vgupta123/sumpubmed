BACKGROUND
aspergillus sojae has been an important filamentous fungus in biotechnology due to its use in diverse fermentative processes for the production of various food products. furthermore, this fungus is a common expression system for the production of enzymes and other metabolites. the availability of molecular genetic tools to explore its biology is thus of big interest. in this study, an agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation  system for a. sojae was developed and its applicability evaluated.


RESULTS
the donor plasmid named prm-egfp was constructed for atmt of a. sojae. this plasmid contains the ble and egfp genes in its transfer dna element  to confer phleomycin resistance and express the enhanced green fluorescent protein  in a. sojae, respectively. agrobacterium tumefaciens  harboring the donor plasmid and a. sojae  were co-cultured under diverse conditions to achieve atmt. the maximum number of transformed fungi was obtained after three days of co-culturing at 28°c, and selection with 50 μg/ml phleomycin. polymerase chain reaction , fluorescence microscopy and western blot analysis for egfp expression confirmed successful genomic integration of the t-dna element in a. sojae. the t-dna was mitotically stable in approximately 40% of the fungal transformants after four generations of sub-culturing under phleomycin pressure.


CONCLUSIONS
we successfully established a new atmt protocol for a. sojae. this transformation system should enable further protein expression studies on this filamentous fungus.
