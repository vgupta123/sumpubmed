BACKGROUND
williams-beuren syndrome  is a genetic disorder associated with multisystemic abnormalities, including craniofacial dysmorphology and cognitive defects. it is caused by a hemizygous microdeletion involving up to  <dig> genes in chromosome 7q <dig> . genotype/phenotype analysis of atypical microdeletions implicates two evolutionary-related transcription factors, gtf2i and gtf2ird <dig>  as prime candidates for the cause of the facial dysmorphology.


RESULTS
using a targeted gtf2ird <dig> knockout mouse, we employed massively-parallel sequencing of mrna  to understand changes in the transcriptional landscape associated with inactivation of gtf2ird <dig> in lip tissue. we found widespread dysregulation of genes including differential expression of  <dig> transcription factors or coactivators, several involved in organ development including hey <dig>  myf <dig>  myog, dlx <dig>  gli <dig>  gli <dig>  lhx <dig>  pou3f <dig>  sox <dig>  foxp <dig>  we also found that the absence of gtf2ird <dig> is associated with increased expression of genes involved in cellular proliferation, including growth factors consistent with the observed phenotype of extreme thickening of the epidermis. at the same time, there was a decrease in the expression of genes involved in other signalling mechanisms, including the wnt pathway, indicating dysregulation in the complex networks necessary for epidermal differentiation and facial skin patterning. several of the differentially expressed genes have known roles in both tissue development and neurological function, such as the transcription factor lhx <dig> which regulates several genes involved in both skin and brain development.


CONCLUSIONS
gtf2ird <dig> inactivation results in widespread gene dysregulation, some of which may be due to the secondary consequences of gene regulatory network disruptions involving several transcription factors and signalling molecules. genes involved in growth factor signalling and cell cycle progression were identified as particularly important for explaining the skin dysmorphology observed in this mouse model. we have noted that a number of the dysregulated genes have known roles in brain development as well as epidermal differentiation and maintenance. therefore, this study provides clues as to the underlying mechanisms that may be involved in the broader profile of wbs.
