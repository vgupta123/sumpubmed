BACKGROUND
individual fingerprinting based on molecular markers has become a popular tool for studies of population genetics and analysis of genetic diversity in germplasm collections, including the solution of synonymy/homonymy and analysis of paternity and kinship.

genetic profiling of individuals is nowadays based on ssr  markers, which have a number of positive features that make them superior to any other molecular marker developed so far. in humans, ssrs with core repeats three to five nucleotides long are preferred because neighbour alleles are more easily separated and distinguished from each other; while in plants, ssrs with shorter repeats, namely two-nucleotides long, are still in use although they suffer lower separation of neighbour alleles and uncomfortable stuttering.


RESULTS
new microsatellite markers, containing tri-, tetra-, and penta-nucleotide repeats, were selected from a total of  <dig>  perfect microsatellites in the genome sequence of nearly homozogous grapevine pn <dig>  assembled from reads covering  <dig>  x genome equivalents.

long nucleotide repeats were selected for fingerprinting, as previously done in many species including humans. the new grape ssr markers were tested for their reproducibility and information content in a panel of  <dig> grape cultivars. allelic segregation was tested in progenies derived from two controlled crosses.


CONCLUSIONS
a list of  <dig> markers with excellent quality of peaks, high power of discrimination, and uniform genome distribution , is proposed for grape genotyping. the reasons for exclusion are given for those that were discarded. the construction of marker-specific allelic ladders is also described, and their use is recommended to harmonise allelic calls and make the data obtained with different equipment and by different laboratories fully comparable.
