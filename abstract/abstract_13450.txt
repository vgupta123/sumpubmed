BACKGROUND
interleukin - <dig> is the key agent for initiating an inflammatory response to infection with helicobacter pylori. some strains of lactobacillus spp. are known to colonize the stomach and suppress inflammation caused by h. pylori. in this study, we characterized two gastric-derived lactobacilli, lactobacillus salivarius  strains b <dig> and b <dig>  capable of inhibiting h. pylori-induced il- <dig> production by gastric epithelial cells.


RESULTS
conditioned media from ls-b <dig> and ls-b <dig> suppressed h. pylori-induced il- <dig> production and mrna expression from ags cells without inhibiting h. pylori growth. these conditioned media suppressed the activation of nf-κb but did not suppress c-jun activation. il- <dig> inhibitory substances in conditioned media of ls-b <dig> and ls-b <dig> are heat-stable and larger than 100 kda in size. the inhibitory activity of ls-b <dig> was abolished when the conditioned medium was treated with α-amylase but still remained when treated with either proteinase k, trypsin, lipase or lysozyme. the activity of ls-b <dig> was abolished when the conditioned medium was treated with either amylase or proteinase k but still remained when treated with lysozyme. treatment with lipase and trypsin also significantly affected the inhibitory activity of ls-b <dig> although the conditioned medium retained il- <dig> suppression statistically different from media control.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that l. salivarius strains b <dig> and b <dig> produce different immunomodulatory factors capable of suppressing h. pylori-induced il- <dig> production from gastric epithelial cells. our results suggest that the large, heat-stable immunomodulatory substance present in the lcm of ls-b <dig> is a polysaccharide, while the one of ls-b <dig> is either complex consisting of components of polysaccharide, lipid and protein or includes multiple components such as glycoprotein and lipoprotein.
