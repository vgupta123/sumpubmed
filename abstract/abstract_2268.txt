BACKGROUND
heat shock factors  play crucial roles in plant developmental and defence processes. the production and quality of pepper , an economically important vegetable crop, are severely reduced by adverse environmental stress conditions, such as heat, salt and osmotic stress. although the pepper genome has been fully sequenced, the characterization of the hsf gene family under abiotic stress conditions remains incomplete.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> cahsf members were identified in the pepper genome by bioinformatics analysis and pcr assays. they were grouped into three classes, cahsfa, b and c, based on highly conserved hsf domains, were distributed over  <dig> of  <dig> chromosomes, with none found on chromosome  <dig>  and all of them, except cahsfa <dig>  formed a protein–protein interaction network. according to the rna-seq data of pepper cultivar cm <dig>  most cahsf members were expressed in at least one tissue among root, stem, leaf, pericarp and placenta. quantitative real-time pcr assays showed that all of the cahsfs responded to heat stress , except cahsfc <dig> in thermotolerant line r <dig> leaves, and that the expression patterns were different from those in thermosensitive line b <dig>  many cahsfs were also regulated by salt and osmotic stresses, as well as exogenous ca2+, putrescine, abscisic acid and methyl jasmonate. additionally, cahsfa <dig> was located in the nucleus and had transcriptional activity, consistent with the typical features of hsfs. time-course expression profiling of cahsfa <dig> in response to heat stress revealed differences in its expression level and pattern between the pepper thermosensitive line b <dig> and thermotolerant line r <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
twenty-five hsf genes were identified in the pepper genome and most of them responded to heat, salt, osmotic stress, and exogenous substances, which provided potential clues for further analyses of cahsfs functions in various kinds of abiotic stresses and of corresponding signal transduction pathways in pepper.
