BACKGROUND
infection by mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, either alone or together, causes serious respiratory diseases in pigs.


RESULTS
to develop an efficient multi-disease subunit vaccine against these pathogens, we produced a chimeric protein called ap <dig>  which comprises a deletion derivative of the n-terminal region of the a. pleuropneumoniae apxiii toxin  and the r <dig> and r <dig> repeats of m. hyopneumoniae p <dig> adhesin , using an e. coli expression system.

the levels of both igg <dig> and igg2a isotypes specific for apxn and p97c in the sera of ap97-immunized mice increased, and ap <dig> induced the secretion of il- <dig> and ifn-Î³ by mouse splenocytes. antisera from mice and pigs immunized with ap <dig> readily reacted with both native apxiii and p <dig> proteins. in addition, immunization with the ap <dig> vaccine effectively protected pigs against challenge with both pathogens.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that ap <dig> confers immunogenicity, and is an effective vaccine that protects pigs against infection by m. hyopneumoniae and a. pleuropneumoniae.
