BACKGROUND
a few reports suggested that low levels of wnt signaling might drive cell reprogramming, but these studies could not establish a clear relationship between wnt signaling and self-renewal networks. there are ongoing debates as to whether and how the wnt/β-catenin signaling is involved in the control of pluripotency gene networks. additionally, whether physiological β-catenin signaling generates stem-like cells through interactions with other pathways is as yet unclear. the nasopharyngeal carcinoma hone <dig> cells have low expression of β-catenin and wild-type expression of p <dig>  which provided a possibility to study regulatory mechanism of stemness networks induced by physiological levels of wnt signaling in these cells.


RESULTS
introduction of increased β-catenin signaling, haploid expression of β-catenin under control by its natural regulators in transferred chromosome  <dig>  resulted in activation of wnt/β-catenin networks and dedifferentiation in hone <dig> hybrid cell lines, but not in esophageal carcinoma slmt <dig> hybrid cells that had high levels of endogenous β-catenin expression. hone <dig> hybrid cells displayed stem cell-like properties, including enhancement of cd24+ and cd44+ populations and generation of spheres that were not observed in parental hone <dig> cells. signaling cascades were detected in hone <dig> hybrid cells, including activation of p53- and rb1-mediated tumor suppressor pathways, up-regulation of nanog-, oct4-, sox2-, and klf4-mediated pluripotency networks, and altered e-cadherin expression in both in vitro and in vivo assays. qpcr array analyses further revealed interactions of physiological wnt/β-catenin signaling with other pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, tgf-β, activin, bmpr, fgfr <dig>  and lifr- and il6st-mediated cell self-renewal networks. using β-catenin shrna inhibitory assays, a dominant role for β-catenin in these cellular network activities was observed. the expression of cell surface markers such as cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig> in generated spheres was progressively up-regulated compared to hone <dig> hybrid cells. thirty-four up-regulated components of the wnt pathway were identified in these spheres.


CONCLUSIONS
wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates self-renewal networks and plays a central role in the control of pluripotency genes, tumor suppressive pathways and expression of cancer stem cell markers. this current study provides a novel platform to investigate the interaction of physiological wnt/β-catenin signaling with stemness transition networks.
