BACKGROUND
accurate diagnosis is pertinent to any disease control programme. if eastern africa is to work towards control of foot-and-mouth disease  using the progressive control pathway for fmd  as a tool, then the capacity of national reference laboratories  mandated to diagnose fmd should match this task. this study assessed the laboratory capacity of  <dig> nrls of the eastern africa region laboratory network member countries using a semi-structured questionnaire and retrospective data from the world reference laboratory for fmd annual reports and genbank® through national centre for biotechnology information for the period 2006– <dig> 


RESULTS
the questionnaire response rate was 13/ <dig> . twelve out of the  <dig> countries/regions had experienced at least one outbreak in the relevant five year period. only two countries  had laboratories at biosecurity level  <dig> and only three  had identified fmd virus serotypes for all reported outbreaks. based on their own country/region assessment, 12/ <dig> of these countries /regions were below stage  <dig> of the pcp-fmd. quarantine  and vaccination  were the major fmd control strategies employed. the majority  of the nrls used serological techniques to diagnose fmd, seven used antigen elisa and three of these  also used molecular techniques which were the tests most frequently requested from collaborating laboratories by the majority  of the nrls. only 4/ <dig>  participated in proficiency testing for fmd. four  laboratories had no quality management systems  in place and where qms existed it was still deficient, thus, none of the laboratories had achieved accreditation for fmd diagnosis.


CONCLUSIONS
this study indicates that fmd diagnostic capacity in eastern africa is still inadequate and largely depends on antigen and antibody elisas techniques undertaken by the nrls. hence, for the region to progress on the pcp-fmd, there is need to: implement regional control measures, improve the serological diagnostic test performance and laboratory capacity of the nrls , and to establish a regional reference laboratory to enforce qms and characterization of fmd virus containing samples.
