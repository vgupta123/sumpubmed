BACKGROUND
recent studies have shown that the crosstalk between microrna  sponges plays an important role in human cancers. however, the co-regulation roles of mirna sponges in protein-protein interactions  are still unknown.


RESULTS
in this study, we propose a multi-step method called mirscoppi to infer mirna sponge co-regulation of ppis. we focus on investigating breast cancer  related mirna sponge co-regulation, by integrating heterogeneous data, including mirna, long non-coding rna  and messenger rna  expression data, experimentally validated mirna-target interactions, ppis and lncrna-target interactions, and the list of breast cancer genes. we find that the inferred brca-related mirscoppi network is highly connected and scale free. the top 10% hub genes in the brca-related mirscoppi network have potential biological implications in breast cancer. by utilizing a graph clustering method, we discover  <dig> brca-related mirscoppi modules. through pathway enrichment analysis of the modules, we find that several modules are significantly enriched in pathways associated with breast cancer. moreover,  <dig> modules have good performance in classifying breast tumor and normal samples, and can act as module signatures for prognostication. by using putative computationally predicted mirna-target interactions, we have consistent results with those obtained using experimentally validated mirna-target interactions, indicating that mirscoppi is robust in inferring mirna sponge co-regulation of ppis in human breast cancer.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the results demonstrate that mirscoppi is a promising tool for inferring brca-related mirna sponge co-regulation of ppis and it can help with the understanding of the co-regulation roles of mirna sponges on the ppis.
