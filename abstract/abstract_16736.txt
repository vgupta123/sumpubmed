BACKGROUND
oxidative stress has been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of parkinson's disease . a plausible source of oxidative stress in nigral dopaminergic neurons is the redox reactions that specifically involve dopamine and produce various toxic molecules, i.e., free radicals and quinone species. α-synuclein, a protein found in lewy bodies characteristic of pd, is also thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of pd and point mutations and multiplications in the gene coding for α-synuclein have been found in familial forms of pd.


RESULTS
we used dopaminergic human neuroblastoma be-m <dig> cell lines stably transfected with wt or a30p mutant α-synuclein to characterize the effect of α-synuclein on dopamine toxicity. cellular toxicity was analyzed by lactate dehydrogenase assay and by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. increased expression of either wild-type or mutant α-synuclein enhances the cellular toxicity induced by the accumulation of intracellular dopamine or dopa.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that an interplay between dopamine and α-synuclein can cause cell death in a neuron-like background. the data presented here are compatible with several models of cytotoxicity, including the formation of α-synuclein oligomers and impairment of the lysosomal degradation.
