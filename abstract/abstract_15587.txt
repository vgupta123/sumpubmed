BACKGROUND
micrornas  are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression implicated in multiple cellular processes. cyclic stretch of alveoli is characteristic of mechanical ventilation, and is postulated to be partly responsible for the lung injury and inflammation in ventilator-induced lung injury. we propose that mirnas may regulate some of the stretch response, and therefore hypothesized that mirnas would be differentially expressed between cyclically stretched and unstretched rat alveolar epithelial cells .


RESULTS
raecs were isolated and cultured to express type i epithelial characteristics. they were then equibiaxially stretched to 25% change in surface area at  <dig> cycles/minute for  <dig> hour or  <dig> hours, or served as unstretched controls, and mirnas were extracted. expression profiling of the mirnas with at least  <dig> -fold change over controls revealed  <dig> mirnas were regulated  with stretch. we validated  <dig> of the mirnas using real-time pcr. using a parallel mrna array under identical conditions and publicly available databases, target genes for these  <dig> differentially regulated mirnas were identified. many of these genes had significant up- or down-regulation under the same stretch conditions. there were  <dig> down-regulated genes associated with up-regulated mirnas, and  <dig> up-regulated genes associated with down-regulated mirnas. specific inhibition of two selected mirnas demonstrated a reduction of the increased epithelial permeability seen with cyclic stretch.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that mirna expression is differentially expressed between cyclically stretched and unstretched alveolar epithelial cells, and may offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention to ameliorate stretch-associated alveolar epithelial cell dysfunction.
