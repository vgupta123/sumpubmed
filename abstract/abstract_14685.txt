BACKGROUND
many bioinformatics studies begin with a multiple sequence alignment as the foundation for their research. this is because multiple sequence alignment can be a useful technique for studying molecular evolution and analyzing sequence structure relationships.


RESULTS
in this paper, we have proposed a vertical decomposition with genetic algorithm  for multiple sequence alignment . in vdga, we divide the sequences vertically into two or more subsequences, and then solve them individually using a guide tree approach. finally, we combine all the subsequences to generate a new multiple sequence alignment. this technique is applied on the solutions of the initial generation and of each child generation within vdga. we have used two mechanisms to generate an initial population in this research: the first mechanism is to generate guide trees with randomly selected sequences and the second is shuffling the sequences inside such trees. two different genetic operators have been implemented with vdga. to test the performance of our algorithm, we have compared it with existing well-known methods, namely prrp, clustalx, dialign, hmmt, sb_pima, ml_pima, multalign, and pileup <dig>  and also other methods, based on genetic algorithms , such as saga, msa-ga and rbt-ga, by solving a number of benchmark datasets from balibase  <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
the experimental results showed that the vdga with three vertical divisions was the most successful variant for most of the test cases in comparison to other divisions considered with vdga. the experimental results also confirmed that vdga outperformed the other methods considered in this research.
