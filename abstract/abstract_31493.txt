BACKGROUND
micrornas  are endogenous small non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression by targeting specific mrnas. however, the possible role of mirnas in the ovary differentiation and development of fish is not well understood. in this study, we examined the expression profiles and differential expression of mirnas during three key stages of ovarian development and different developmental stages in common carp cyprinus carpio.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> mirnas were identified, including  <dig> conserved mirnas highly conserved among various species,  <dig> mirnas registered in mirbase for common carp, and  <dig> novel mirnas identified in common carp for the first time. comparison of mirna expression profiles among the five libraries identified  <dig> co-expressed and  <dig> specific expressed mirnas. overall,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> specifically expressed mirnas were identified in primordial gonad, juvenile ovary, and adult ovary, respectively. mir-6758-3p, mir-3050-5p, and mir-2985-3p were highly expressed in primordial gonad, mir-3544-5p, mir-6877-3p, and mir-9086-5p were highly expressed in juvenile ovary, and mir-154-3p, mir-5307-5p, and mir-3958-3p were highly expressed in adult ovary. predicted target genes of specific mirnas in primordial gonad were involved in many reproductive biology signaling pathways, including transforming growth factor-β, wnt, oocyte meiosis, mitogen-activated protein kinase, notch, p <dig>  and gonadotropin-releasing hormone pathways. target-gene prediction revealed upward trends in mirnas targeting male-bias genes, including dmrt <dig>  atm, gsdf, and sox <dig>  and downward trends in mirnas targeting female-bias genes including foxl <dig>  smad <dig>  and smad <dig>  other sex-related genes such as sf <dig> were also predicted to be mirna target genes.


CONCLUSIONS
this comprehensive mirna transcriptome analysis demonstrated differential expression profiles of mirnas during ovary development in common carp. these results could facilitate future exploitation of the sex-regulatory roles and mechanisms of mirnas, especially in primordial gonads, while the specifically expressed mirnas represent candidates for studying the mechanisms of ovary determination in yellow river carp.
