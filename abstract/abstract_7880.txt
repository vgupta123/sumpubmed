BACKGROUND
prestimulus eeg alpha activity in humans has been considered to reflect ongoing top-down preparation for the performance of subsequent tasks. since theta oscillations may be related to poststimulus top-down processing, we investigated whether prestimulus eeg theta activity also reflects top-down cognitive preparation for a stimulus.


RESULTS
we recorded eeg data from  <dig> healthy controls performing a color and shape discrimination task, and used the wavelet transformation to investigate the time course and power of oscillatory activity in the signals. we observed a relationship between both anterior theta and posterior alpha power in the prestimulus period and the type of subsequent task.


CONCLUSIONS
since task-differences were reflected in both theta and alpha activities prior to stimulus onset, both prestimulus theta  and prestimulus alpha  activities may reflect prestimulus top-down preparation for the performance of subsequent tasks.
