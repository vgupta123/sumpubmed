BACKGROUND
toll-like receptor  agonists reportedly have potent antiviral and antitumor activities and may be a new kind of adjuvant for enhancing immune efficacy. resiquimod  is an imidazoquinoline compound with potent antiviral activity and functions through the tlr7/tlr <dig> myd88-dependent signaling pathway. polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid  is a synthetic analog of double-stranded rna that induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the activation of nf-κb through tlr <dig>  this study investigated the potential of r <dig> and poly as an adjuvant 146s foot-and-mouth disease virus  vaccine formulated with aluminum hydroxide 3).


RESULTS
antibody titers to fmdv and cd8+ t cells were markedly enhanced in mice immunized to 146s fmdv + al3 + r848 + poly compared with mice immunized to fmdv + isa <dig>  ifn-γ secretion substantially increased compared with il- <dig> secretion by splenic t cells stimulated with fmdv antigens in vitro, suggesting that r <dig>  poly, and with al <dig> together biased the immune response toward a th1-type direction.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicated that the r <dig> and poly together with al <dig> enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses to immunization with 146s fmdv antigens. thus, this new vaccine formulation can be used for fmdv prevention.
