BACKGROUND
a significant proportion of the human genome is comprised of human endogenous retroviruses . herv transcripts are found in every human tissue. expression of proviruses of the herv-k family has been associated with development of human tumors, in particular germ cell tumors . very little is known about transcriptional activity of individual hml- <dig> loci in human tissues, though.


RESULTS
by employing private nucleotide differences between loci, we assigned ~ <dig> hml- <dig> cdnas to individual hml- <dig> loci, identifying, in total,  <dig> transcriptionally active hml- <dig> proviruses. several loci are active in various human tissue types. transcription levels of some hml- <dig> loci appear higher than those of other loci. several hml- <dig> rec-encoding loci are expressed in gct and non-gct tissues. a provirus on chromosome 22q <dig>  appears strongly upregulated in pathologic gct tissues and may explain high hml- <dig> gag protein levels in gcts. presence of gag and env antibodies in gct patients is not correlated with activation of individual loci. hml- <dig> proviruses previously reported capable of forming an infectious hml- <dig> variant are transcriptionally active in germ cell tissue. our study furthermore shows that expressed sequence tag  data are insufficient to describe transcriptional activity of hml- <dig> and other herv loci in tissues of interest.


CONCLUSIONS
our, to date, largest-scale study reveals in greater detail expression patterns of individual hml- <dig> loci in human tissues of clinical interest. moreover, large-scale, specialized studies are indicated to better comprehend transcriptional activity and regulation of hervs. we thus emphasize the need for a specialized herv transcriptome project.
