BACKGROUND
the green anole lizard, anolis carolinensis, is a key species for both laboratory and field-based studies of evolutionary genetics, development, neurobiology, physiology, behavior, and ecology. as the first non-avian reptilian genome sequenced, a. carolinesis is also a prime reptilian model for comparison with other vertebrate genomes. the public databases of ensembl and ncbi have provided a first generation gene annotation of the anole genome that relies primarily on sequence conservation with related species. a second generation annotation based on tissue-specific transcriptomes would provide a valuable resource for molecular studies.


RESULTS
here we provide an annotation of the a. carolinensis genome based on de novo assembly of deep transcriptomes of  <dig> adult and embryonic tissues. this revised annotation describes  <dig>  transcripts, compared to  <dig>  and  <dig>  currently for ensembl and ncbi, and  <dig>  predicted protein-coding genes. a key improvement in this revised annotation is coverage of untranslated region  sequences, with 79% and 59% of transcripts containing 5’ and 3’ utrs, respectively. gaps in genome sequence from the current a. carolinensis build  are highlighted by our identification of  <dig>  unmapped transcripts, representing  <dig>  orthologues, with less than 70% genomic coverage.


CONCLUSIONS
incorporation of tissue-specific transcriptome sequence into the a. carolinensis genome annotation has markedly improved its utility for comparative and functional studies. increased utr coverage allows for more accurate predicted protein sequence and regulatory analysis. this revised annotation also provides an atlas of gene expression specific to adult and embryonic tissues.
