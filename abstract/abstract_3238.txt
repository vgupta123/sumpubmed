BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small noncoding rnas about  <dig> nt long that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. their key effects on various biological processes, e.g., embryonic development, cell division, differentiation and apoptosis, are widely recognized. evidence suggests that aberrant expression of mirnas may contribute to many types of human diseases, including cancer. here we present a database of differentially expressed mirnas in human cancers , to explore aberrantly expressed mirnas among different cancers.


RESULTS
we collected the mirna expression profiles of  <dig> cancer types, curated from  <dig> microarray data sets in peer-reviewed publications. the significance analysis of microarrays method was used to retrieve the mirnas that have dramatically different expression levels in cancers when compared to normal tissues. this database provides statistical results for differentially expressed mirnas in each data set. a total of  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas  were obtained in the current version of dbdemc. furthermore, low-throughput data from the same literature were also included in the database for validation. an easy-to-use web interface was designed for users. annotations about each mirna can be queried through mirna id or mirbase accession numbers, or can be browsed by different cancer types.


CONCLUSIONS
this database is expected to be a valuable source for identification of cancer-related mirnas, thereby helping with the improvement of classification, diagnosis and treatment of human cancers. all the information is freely available through http:// <dig> . <dig> /dbdemc/index.html.
