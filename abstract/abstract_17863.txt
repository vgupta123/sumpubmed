BACKGROUND
spinal muscular atrophy is caused by reduced levels of the survival of motor neurons  protein. smn is found in large complexes with sm proteins and at least eight other proteins, including seven "gemins". these complexes are involved in the assembly of snrnps in the cytoplasm and their transport into the nucleus, but the precise roles of the individual protein components are largely unknown.


RESULTS
we have investigated the subcellular distribution of gemins using novel antibodies against gemins 3– <dig>  and existing mabs against smn, gemin <dig>  unrip, fibrillarin and profilin ii. most gemins were equally distributed between nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of hela cells, but gemin <dig> and unrip were more abundant in the cytoplasm. in a cytoplasmic extract obtained by mild disruption of hela cells, nearly all the smn and gemins 2– <dig> were in large complexes, but most of the gemin <dig> sedimented separately with a lower s value. most of the unrip sedimented with gemins  <dig> and  <dig> near the top of the sucrose density gradients, separate from both smn and gemin <dig>  anti-smn mabs pulled down gemin <dig> from cytoplasmic extracts, but not from nuclear extracts, and gemin <dig> did not co-sediment with large smn complexes in nuclear extracts. these data suggest that gemin <dig> is easily detached from smn-gemin complexes in the nucleus. by immuno-histochemistry, gemin <dig> was rarely detectable in nuclear gems/cajal bodies, although it was accessible to antibody and easily detectable when present. this suggests that gemin <dig> is normally absent from smn complexes in these nuclear storage sites.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that smn complexes usually exist without gemin <dig> in nuclear gems/cajal bodies. gemin <dig> is believed to be involved in capturing snrna into smn complexes in the cytoplasm for transport into the nucleus. we hypothesize that gemin <dig>  though present in the nucleus, is no longer needed for smn complex function during the time these complexes are stored in gems/cajal bodies.
