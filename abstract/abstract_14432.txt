BACKGROUND
micrornas  are derived from larger hairpin rna precursors and play essential regular roles in both animals and plants. a number of computational methods for mirna genes finding have been proposed in the past decade, yet the problem is far from being tackled, especially when considering the imbalance issue of known mirnas and unidentified mirnas, and the pre-mirnas with multi-loops or higher minimum free energy . this paper presents a new computational approach, mirensvm, for finding mirna genes. aiming at better prediction performance, an ensemble support vector machine  classifier is established to deal with the imbalance issue, and multi-loop features are included for identifying those pre-mirnas with multi-loops.


RESULTS
we collected a representative dataset, which contains  <dig> real mirna precursors identified by experimental procedure and other computational methods, and  <dig> pseudo ones from several datasets. experiments showed that our mirensvm achieved a  <dig> % specificity and a  <dig> % sensitivity on the dataset. compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, mirensvm obtained better prediction results. we also applied our method to predict  <dig> homo sapiens pre-mirnas and  <dig> anopheles gambiae pre-mirnas that first appeared in mirbase <dig> , mirensvm got a 100% prediction rate. furthermore, performance evaluation was conducted over  <dig> additional species in mirbase <dig> , and  <dig> %  animal pre-mirnas were correctly identified by mirensvm.


CONCLUSIONS
mirensvm is an ensemble support vector machine  classification system for better detecting mirna genes, especially those with multi-loop secondary structure.
