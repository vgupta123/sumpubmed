BACKGROUND
ca_c <dig> from clostridium acetobutylicum is a protein of unknown function. sequence analysis predicted that part of the protein contained a metallopeptidase-related domain. there are over  <dig> homologs of similar size in large sequence databases such as uniprot, with pairwise sequence identities in the range of ~40-60%. ca_c <dig> was chosen for crystal structure determination for structure-based function annotation of novel protein sequence space.


RESULTS
the structure confirmed that ca_c <dig> contained an n-terminal metallopeptidase-like domain. the structure revealed two extra domains: an α+β domain inserted in the metallopeptidase-like domain and a c-terminal circularly permuted winged-helix-turn-helix domain.


CONCLUSIONS
based on our sequence and structural analyses using the crystal structure of ca_c <dig> we provide a view into the possible functions of the protein. from contextual information from gene-neighborhood analysis, we propose that rather than being a peptidase, ca_c <dig> and its homologs might play a role in biosynthesis of a modified cell-surface carbohydrate in conjunction with several sugar-modification enzymes. these results provide the groundwork for the experimental verification of the function.
