BACKGROUND
we introduce a protein docking refinement method that accepts complexes consisting of any number of monomeric units. the method uses a scoring function based on a tight coupling between evolutionary conservation, geometry and physico-chemical interactions. understanding the role of protein complexes in the basic biology of organisms heavily relies on the detection of protein complexes and their structures. different computational docking methods are developed for this purpose, however, these methods are often not accurate and their results need to be further refined to improve the geometry and the energy of the resulting complexes. also, despite the fact that complexes in nature often have more than two monomers, most docking methods focus on dimers since the computational complexity increases exponentially due to the addition of monomeric units.


RESULTS
our results show that the refinement scheme can efficiently handle complexes with more than two monomers by biasing the results towards complexes with native interactions, filtering out false positive results. our refined complexes have better irmsds with respect to the known complexes and lower energies than those initial docked structures.


CONCLUSIONS
evolutionary conservation information allows us to bias our results towards possible functional interfaces, and the probabilistic selection scheme helps us to escape local energy minima. we aim to incorporate our refinement method in a larger framework which also enables docking of multimeric complexes given only monomeric structures.
