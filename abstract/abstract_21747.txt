BACKGROUND
fibre type specification is a poorly understood process beginning in embryogenesis in which skeletal muscle myotubes switch myosin-type to establish fast, slow and mixed fibre muscle groups with distinct function. growth factors are required to establish slow fibres; it is unknown how fast twitch fibres are specified. igf- <dig> is an embryonically expressed growth factor with established in vitro roles in skeletal muscle. its localisation and role in embryonic muscle differentiation had not been established.


RESULTS
between e <dig>  and e <dig>  fast myosin  localises to secondary myotubes evenly distributed throughout the embryonic musculature and gradually increasing in number so that by e <dig>  around half contain fmyhc. the igf- <dig> pattern closely correlates with fmyhc from e <dig>  and peaks at e <dig>  when over 90% of fmyhc+ myotubes also contain igf- <dig>  igf- <dig> lags fmyhc and it is absent from muscle myotubes until e <dig> . igf- <dig> strongly down-regulates by e <dig> . a striking feature of the fmyhc pattern is its increased heterogeneity and attenuation in many fibres from e <dig>  to day one after birth . transgenic mice  which express igf- <dig> in all of their myotubes, have increased fmyhc staining, a higher proportion of fmyhc+ myotubes and loose their fmyhc staining heterogeneity. in igf- <dig> deficient mice  fmyhc+ myotubes are reduced to 60% of wt by e <dig> . in vitro, mig induces a 50% excess of fmyhc+ and a 30% reduction of smhyc+ myotubes in c <dig> cells which can be reversed by igf-2-targeted shrna resulting in 50% reduction of fmyhc. total number of myotubes was not affected.


CONCLUSIONS
in wt embryos the appearance of igf- <dig> in embryonic myotubes lags fmyhc, but by e <dig>  around 45% of secondary myotubes contain both proteins. forced expression of igf- <dig> into all myotubes causes an excess, and absence of igf- <dig> suppresses, the fmyhc+ myotube component in both embryonic muscle and differentiated myoblasts. igf- <dig> is thus required, not for initiating secondary myotube differentiation, but for establishing the correct proportion of fmyhc+ myotubes during fibre type specification . since specific loss of fmyhc fibres is associated with many skeletal muscle pathologies these data have important medical implications.
