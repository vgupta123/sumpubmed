BACKGROUND
transcription factor hadreb <dig> was identified in sunflower  as a drought-responsive element-binding factor  <dig>  with unique properties. hadreb <dig> and the sunflower heat shock factor a <dig>  co-activated the hahsp <dig> g <dig> promoter in sunflower embryos. both factors could be involved in transcriptional co-activation of additional small heat stress protein  promoters, and thus contribute to the hahsfa9-mediated enhancement of longevity and basal thermotolerance of seeds.


RESULTS
we found that overexpression of hadreb <dig> in seeds did not enhance longevity. this was deduced from assays of basal thermotolerance and controlled seed-deterioration, which were performed with transgenic tobacco. furthermore, the constitutive overexpression of hadreb <dig> did not increase thermotolerance in seedlings or result in the accumulation of hsps at normal growth temperatures. in contrast, when hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> were conjointly overexpressed in seeds, we observed positive effects on seed longevity, beyond those observed with overexpression of hahsfa <dig> alone. such additional effects are accompanied by a subtle enhancement of the accumulation of subsets of shsps belonging to the ci and cii cytosolic classes.


CONCLUSIONS
our results reveal the functional interdependency of hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> in seeds. hadreb <dig> differs from other previously characterized dreb <dig> factors in plants in terms of its unique functional interaction with the seed-specific hahsfa <dig> factor. no functional interaction between hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> was observed when both factors were conjointly overexpressed in vegetative tissues. we therefore suggest that additional, seed-specific factors, or protein modifications, could be required for the functional interaction between hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig>
