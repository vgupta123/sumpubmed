BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis . with chronicity of infection, the organism resides as a biofilm, shows multi-drug resistance, diversifies its colony morphology and becomes auxotrophic. the patients have been found to be colonized with multiple genotypes. the present work was carried out to characterize p. aeruginosa isolated from children with cystic fibrosis using phenotypic and genotypic methods.


RESULTS
we studied  <dig> patients with cf attending the pediatric chest clinic at all india institute of medical sciences, new delhi, india during august 1998-august  <dig>  these patients were regularly followed up at the clinic. out of  <dig> patients,  <dig> were culture positive for p. aeruginosa where  <dig> were chronically infected  and  <dig> were intermittently colonized with the organism . patients under group <dig> had significantly higher rates of hospitalization, death and colonization with different colony morphotypes . the isolates from group <dig> patients were the positive producers of extended spectrum beta lactamase. a total of  <dig> auxotrophs were recovered from  <dig> patients where one was chronically infected with p. aeruginosa and the other was a recently enrolled patient. the auxotrophs had the specific requirement for methionine and arginine. molecular typing revealed  <dig> eric-pcr  and  <dig> pcr-ribotyping  patterns. by eric-pcr,  <dig> patients were colonized with 2â€“ <dig> genotypes and the remaining  <dig> patients were colonized with the single genotype.


CONCLUSIONS
with chronicity of infection, p. aeruginosa becomes multidrug resistant, diversifies its colony morphology, acquires mucoidity and shows auxotrophy for amino acids. the chronically infected patients can be colonized with multiple genotypes. thus in a particular clinical set up, high index of suspicion should be there for diagnosis of cf patients so as to prevent the delay in diagnosis and management of cf patients.
