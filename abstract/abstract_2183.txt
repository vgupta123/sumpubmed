BACKGROUND
snap- <dig> is a synaptic protein known to be involved in exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in neurons and of large dense-core vesicles in neuroendocrine cells. its role in exocytosis has been studied in snap- <dig> knockout mice, in lysed synaptosomes lacking functional snap- <dig> and in cells after treatment with botulinum toxins a or e that specifically cleave snap- <dig>  these studies have shown that snap- <dig> appears to be required for most but not all evoked secretion. in order to further study the role of snap- <dig> in catecholamine secretion from pc <dig> cells we have used the recently developed technique of rna interference to generate pc <dig> cell lines with virtually undetectable levels of snap- <dig>  rna interference is the sequence-specific silencing or knockdown of gene expression triggered by the introduction of double-stranded rna into a cell. rna interference can be elicited in mammalian cells in a number of ways, one of which is by the expression of small hairpin rnas from a transfected plasmid. selection of stably transfected cell lines expressing a small hairpin rna allows one-time characterization of the degree and specificity of gene silencing and affords a continuing source of well-characterized knockdown cells for experimentation.


RESULTS
a pc <dig> cell line stably transfected with a plasmid expressing an shrna targeting snap- <dig> has been established. this snap- <dig> knockdown cell line has barely detectable levels of snap- <dig>  but normal levels of other synaptic proteins. catecholamine secretion elicited by depolarization of the snap- <dig> knockdown cells was reduced to 37% of control.


CONCLUSIONS
knockdown of snap- <dig> in pc <dig> cells reduces but does not eliminate evoked secretion of catecholamines. transient expression of human snap- <dig> in the knockdown cells rescues the deficit in catecholamine secretion.
