BACKGROUND
plant micrornas  are involved in post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of several processes, including the response to biotic and abiotic stress, often contributing to the adaptive response of the plant to adverse conditions. in addition to conserved mirnas, found in a wide range of plant species a number of novel species-specific mirnas, displaying lower levels of expression can be found. due to low abundance, non conserved mirnas are difficult to identify and isolate using conventional approaches. conversely, deep-sequencing of small rna  libraries can detect even poorly expressed mirnas.

no mirnas from globe artichoke have been described to date. we analyzed the mirnaome from artichoke by deep sequencing four srna libraries obtained from nacl stressed and control leaves and roots.


RESULTS
conserved and novel mirnas were discovered using accepted criteria. the expression level of selected mirnas was monitored by quantitative real-time pcr. targets were predicted and validated for their cleavage site. a total of  <dig> artichoke mirnas were identified,  <dig>  of which were conserved with other plant species, and  <dig> were novel. some mirnas were differentially expressed according to tissue or condition, magnitude of variation after salt stress being more pronounced in roots. target function was predicted by comparison to arabidopsis proteins; the  <dig> targets  identified included transcription factors and other genes, most of which involved in the response to various stresses. an unusual cleaved transcript was detected for mir <dig> target, transport inhibitor response  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the mirnaome from artichoke, including novel mirnas, was unveiled, providing useful information on the expression in different organs and conditions. new target genes were identified. we suggest that the generation of secondary short-interfering rnas from mir <dig> target can be a general rule in the plant kingdom.
