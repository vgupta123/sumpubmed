BACKGROUND
in cell differentiation, a less specialized cell differentiates into a more specialized one, even though all cells in one organism have  the same genome. epigenetic factors such as histone modifications are known to play a significant role in cell differentiation. we previously introduce cell-type trees to represent the differentiation of cells into more specialized types, a representation that partakes of both ontogeny and phylogeny.


RESULTS
we propose a maximum-likelihood  approach to build cell-type trees and show that this ml approach outperforms our earlier distance-based and parsimony-based approaches. we then study the reconstruction of ancestral cell types; since both ancestral and derived cell types can coexist in adult organisms, we propose a lifting algorithm to infer internal nodes. we present results on our lifting algorithm obtained both through simulations and on real datasets.


CONCLUSIONS
we show that our ml-based approach outperforms previously proposed techniques such as distance-based and parsimony-based methods. we show our lifting-based approach works well on both simulated and real data.
