BACKGROUND
cerebral oedema is closely related to the permeability of blood–brain barrier, vascular endothelial growth factor  and its receptor vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  <dig>  all of which are important blood–brain barrier  permeability regulatory factors. zonula occludens  <dig>  and claudin- <dig> are also the key components of bbb. hypertonic saline is widely used to alleviate cerebral oedema. this study aimed to explore the possible mechanisms underlying hypertonic saline that ameliorates cerebral oedema effectively.

methods
middle cerebral artery occlusion  model in sprague-dawley  rats and of oxygen–glucose deprivation model in primary astrocytes were used in this study. the brain water content  was used to assess the effect of 10 % hs on cerebral oedema. the assessment of evans blue  extravasation was performed to evaluate the protective effect of 10 % hs on blood–brain barrier. the quantification of vegf, vegfr <dig>  zo- <dig> and claudin- <dig> was used to illustrate the mechanism of 10 % hs ameliorating cerebral oedema.


RESULTS
bwc was analysed by wet-to-dry ratios in the ischemic hemisphere of sd rats; it was significantly decreased after 10 % hs treatment . we also investigated the blood–brain barrier protective effect by 10 % hs which reduced eb extravasation effectively in the peri-ischemic brain tissue. in parallel to the above notably at 24 h following mcao, mrna and protein expression of vegf and vegfr <dig> in the peri-ischemic brain tissue was down-regulated after 10 % hs treatment . along with this, in vitro studies showed increased vegf and vegfr <dig> mrna and protein expression in primary astrocytes under hypoxic condition , but it was suppressed after hs treatment . in addition, hs inhibited the down-regulation of zo- <dig>  claudin- <dig> effectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the results suggest that 10 % hs could alleviate cerebral oedema possibly through reducing the ischemia induced bbb permeability as a consequence of inhibiting vegf–vegfr2-mediated down-regulation of zo- <dig>  claudin- <dig>
