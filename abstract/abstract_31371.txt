BACKGROUND
alfalfa  is one of the most important legume forage species in china and many other countries of the world. it provides a quality source of proteins and minerals to animals. genetic underpinnings for these important traits, however, are elusive. an alfalfa  association mapping study for six traits, namely crude protein , rumen undegraded protein , and four mineral elements , was conducted in three consecutive years using a large collection encompassing  <dig> genotypes genotyped with  <dig> simple sequence repeat  markers.


RESULTS
all the traits were significantly influenced by genotype, environment, and genotype × environment interaction. eight-five significant associations  were identified. among these, five associations with ca were repeatedly observed and six co-localized associations were identified.


CONCLUSIONS
the identified marker alleles significantly associated with the traits provided important information for understanding genetic controls of alfalfa quality. the markers could be used in assisting selection for the individual traits in breeding populations for developing new alfalfa cultivars.
