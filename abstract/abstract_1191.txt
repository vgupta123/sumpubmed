BACKGROUND
the appearance of aβ <dig> peptide deposits is admitted to be a key event in the pathogenesis of alzheimer's disease, although amyloid deposits also occur in aged non-demented subjects. aβ <dig> is a degradation product of the amyloid protein precursor . it can be catabolized by several enzymes, reabsorbed by capillaries or cleared into cerebrospinal fluid . the possible involvement of a decrease in csf turnover in a4β <dig> deposit formation is up to now poorly known. we therefore investigated a possible relationship between a reduced csf turnover and the csf levels of the a4β <dig> peptide.

to this aim, csf of  <dig> patients with decreased csf turnover were studied. these patients presented chronic hydrocephalus communicating or obstructive, which required surgery . nine subjects had idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus , and the other  <dig> chronic hydrocephalus from other origins .

the aβ <dig> peptide concentration was measured by an elisa test in  <dig> ventricular csf samples and in  <dig> lumbar csf samples from patients with communicating hydrocephalus.


RESULTS
the  <dig> patients with lumbar csf analysis had similar levels of lumbar and ventricular aβ <dig>  a significant reduction in aβ <dig> ventricular levels was observed in  <dig> /  <dig> patients with hydrocephalus. the values were lower than  <dig> pg/ml in  <dig> out of  <dig> subjects with inph, and in  <dig> out of  <dig> subjects with och.


CONCLUSIONS
the decrease of csf aβ <dig> seems to occur independently of the surgical hydrocephalus aetiology. this suggests that a csf reduced turnover may play an important role in the decrease of csf aβ <dig> concentration.
