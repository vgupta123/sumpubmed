BACKGROUND
the aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of different thermal manipulation  protocols during embryogenesis on thermotolerance acquisition parameters during subsequent thermal challenge  at posthatch day  <dig>  a total of  <dig> fertile chicken eggs were divided randomly into five treatments : control was maintained at  <dig>  °c and 56 % relative humidity  whereas, tm <dig>  tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig> were subjected to  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and 40 °c for 18 h and 65 % rh daily during embryonic days ed 12– <dig>  hatched chicks from each treatment group allocated randomly into two sub-treatment groups  and thermal challenge . at day  <dig> of age, chicks subjected to tc by adjusting room temperature to 42 °c for 6 h while naïve chicks kept under regular conditions . chick’s response to tc evaluated by determination of plasma t <dig>  t <dig>  corticosterone, total proteins, albumin, selected enzymes and some electrolytes at the beginning  and after  <dig>   <dig> and 5 h of tc in tm and tn chicks. furthermore, pectoral and thigh muscles mrna expression of atrogin- <dig>  ck, avucp, dio <dig>  dio <dig> were evaluated in tc and tn sub-treatment groups.


RESULTS
tm induced a significant reduction in free t <dig> and elevation in total proteins and albumin in plasma with significant down-regulation of atrogin- <dig> and dio <dig> and significant up-regulation of dio <dig> mrna expression in muscle of tm chicks compare to control. during tc at day  <dig>  decrease in the concentrations of plasma free t <dig>  total proteins and albumin with increase in t <dig> have been detected in control and tm chicks. tc induced up-regulation of atrogin- <dig> and dio <dig> with down-regulation of dio <dig> gene expression in muscles of all tc chicks.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study indicated that, tm improved thermotolerance acquisition by decreasing basal metabolic rate and muscle injury during thermal stress. basal metabolic rate decreased via reduction of plasma t <dig> concentration with up and down regulation of expression of dio <dig> and dio <dig>  respectively in muscles. muscle injury protected by stimulation of protein biosynthesis and down-regulation of atrogin- <dig> expression.
