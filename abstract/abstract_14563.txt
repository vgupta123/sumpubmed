BACKGROUND
we conducted geographic information system  habitat analyses for lesser prairie-chicken  conservation planning. the  <dig>  ha study area included most of the occupied habitat for the lpch in new mexico. the objectives were to identify and quantify:  <dig>  suitable lpch habitat in new mexico,  <dig>  conversion of native habitats,  <dig>  potential for habitat restoration, and  <dig>  unsuitable habitat available for oil and gas activities.


RESULTS
we found 16% of suitable habitat  distributed in  <dig> patches of at least  <dig>  ha and 11% of suitable habitat  distributed in four patches over  <dig>  ha. the area converted from native vegetation types comprised 17% of the study area. ninety-five percent of agricultural conversion occurred on private lands in the northeastern corner of the study area. most known herbicide-related conversions  occurred in rangelands in the western part of the study area, on lands managed primarily by the us bureau of land management . we identified  <dig>  ha  of habitats with reasonable restoration potential. sixty-two percent of the primary population area  contained occupied, suitable, or potentially suitable habitat, leaving 38% that could be considered for oil and gas development.


CONCLUSIONS
although suitable lpch habitat appears at first glance to be abundant in southeastern new mexico, only a fraction of apparently suitable vegetation types constitute quality habitat. however, we identified habitat patches that could be restored through mesquite control or shin-oak reintroduction. the analysis also identified areas of unsuitable habitat with low restoration potential that could be targeted for oil and gas exploration, in lieu of occupied, high-quality habitats. used in combination with gis analysis and current lpch population data, the habitat map represents a powerful conservation and management tool.
