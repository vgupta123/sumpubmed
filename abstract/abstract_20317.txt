BACKGROUND
staufen <dig> , a double-stranded rna-binding protein, is a component of neuronal rna granules, which are dendritic mrna transport machines. although stau <dig> is thought to be involved in the dendritic targeting of several mrnas in neurons, the mechanism whereby stau <dig> regulates these mrnas is unknown. to elucidate the functions of stau <dig>  we screened for novel binding partners by affinity purification of gst-tagged stau <dig> from 293f cells.


RESULTS
three rna helicases, rna helicase a, upf <dig> and mov <dig>  were identified in stau2-containing complexes. we focused our studies on upf <dig>  a key player in nonsense-mediated mrna decay. stau <dig> was found to bind directly to upf <dig> in an rna-independent manner in vitro. tethering stau <dig> to the 3'-untranslated region  of a reporter gene had little effect on its expression in hela cells. in contrast, when the same tethering assay was performed in 293f cells, we observed an increase in reporter protein levels. this upregulation of protein expression by stau <dig> turned out to be dependent on upf <dig>  moreover, we found that in 293f cells, stau <dig> upregulates the reporter mrna level in an upf1-independent manner.


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that the recruitment of stau <dig> alone or in combination with upf <dig> differentially affects the fate of mrnas. moreover, the results suggest that stau2-mediated fate determination could be executed in a cell type-specific manner.
