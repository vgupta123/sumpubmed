BACKGROUND
mass spectrometry is one of the most important techniques in the field of proteomics. maldi-tof mass spectrometry has become popular during the last decade due to its high speed and sensitivity for detecting proteins and peptides. maldi-tof-ms can be also used in combination with machine learning techniques and statistical methods for knowledge discovery. although there are many software libraries and tools that can be combined for these kind of analysis, there is still a need for all-in-one solutions with graphical user-friendly interfaces and avoiding the need of programming skills.


RESULTS
mass-up, an open software multiplatform application for maldi-tof-ms knowledge discovery is herein presented. mass-up software allows data preprocessing, as well as subsequent analysis including  biomarker discovery,  clustering,  biclustering,  three-dimensional pca visualization and  classification of large sets of spectra data.


CONCLUSIONS
mass-up brings knowledge discovery within reach of maldi-tof-ms researchers. mass-up is distributed under license gplv <dig> and it is open and free to all users at http://sing.ei.uvigo.es/mass-up.
