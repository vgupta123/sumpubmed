BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  in children is neglected, mainly due to lack of sensitive diagnostic tools. recently xpert mtb/rif assay has revolutionized the diagnostic field, but its usefulness in pediatric tb has not been reported from india and no report is available on its use on long term archived samples.

methods
we recruited  <dig> pediatric patients with probable intrathoracic tuberculosis and their gastric aspirate  and induced sputum  samples on  <dig> consecutive days were collected between january  <dig> and december  <dig>  all samples  were subjected to smear examination, bactec-mgit culture and in-house multiplex pcr. an aliquot of each sample was stored at −80 °c and tested in xpert mtb/rif assay in  <dig> 


RESULTS
sample wise and patient wise detection rate of smear microscopy was  <dig>  % and 10 %, while for bactec-mgit culture this rate was  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively. of the 130 day  <dig> ga samples,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % day  <dig> ga samples were culture positive. only  <dig>  % ga samples were positive on both days. of the  <dig> is samples collected on day  <dig> and day  <dig>   <dig>  % and  <dig>  % samples were culture positive. a combination of ga and is yielded best results. combining both ga and is, the overall sensitivity of xpert mtb/rif on smear and culture positive samples was  <dig>  %. in smear negative and culture positive samples its sensitivity was  <dig>  %. the duration of sample storage impacted the xpert mtb/rif test performance . in smear positive samples stored for 650– <dig> days, its sensitivity was  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % for is and ga samples which dropped to  <dig>  % and 50 %, respectively, if stored for more than 1050 days.

discussion
confirmatory diagnosis of tuberculosis particularly in children is a medical challenge. no laboratory or radiological test can reach to a satisfactory level of diagnostic sensitivity. however, in this study we foundthat combination of multiple samples and multiple diagnostic tests can give much better yield, though notoptimum. in present study, combination of  <dig> gastric aspirates  and  <dig> induced sputum  samples collected on two consecutive days, and tested on three diagnostic methods yielded a significantly high detection rate. despite long term storage, the overall sensitivity of xpert mtb/rif on smear and -culture positive samples remained very high. but after storing these samples under subfreezing conditions thesensitivity of xpert mtb/rif decreased significantly. this is expected because even if the sample is smear and culture positive, the count of surviving mycobacteria goes down, after several years this count can reach to a undetectable level.


CONCLUSIONS
this report shows that smear and culture positive samples stored at subfreezing conditions for several years can be used in the xpert mtb/rif assay, while maintaining appreciable diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity.
