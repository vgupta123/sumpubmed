BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium is an intracellular bacterial pathogen which can colonize a variety of hosts, including human, causing syndromes that vary from gastroenteritis and diarrhea to systemic disease.


RESULTS
in this work we present structural information as well as insights into the in vivo function of yqic, a 99-residue protein of s. typhimurium, which belongs to the cluster of the orthologous group  <dig> . we found that yqic shares biophysical and biochemical properties with brucella abortus bmfp, the only previously characterized member of this group, such as a high alpha helix content, a coiled-coil domain involved in trimerization and a membrane fusogenic activity in vitro. in addition, we demonstrated that yqic localizes at cytoplasmic and membrane subcellular fractions, that a s. typhimurium yqic deficient strain had a severe attenuation in virulence in the murine model when inoculated both orally and intraperitoneally, and was impaired to replicate at physiological and high temperatures in vitro, although it was still able to invade and replicate inside epithelial and macrophages cell lines.


CONCLUSIONS
this work firstly demonstrates the importance of a cog <dig> member for pathogen-host interaction, and suggests a common function conserved among members of this group.
