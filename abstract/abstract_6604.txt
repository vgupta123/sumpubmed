BACKGROUND
sox <dig>  a member of the sry-related hmg-box gene family, is a critical transcription factor for several important cell lineages, most notably the neural crest stem cells and the derivative peripheral glial cells and melanocytes. thus far, only a handful of direct target genes are known for this transcription factor limiting our understanding of the biological network it governs.


RESULTS
we describe identification of multiple direct regulatory target genes of sox <dig> through a procedure based on function and conservation. by combining rna interference technique and dna microarray technology, we have identified a set of genes that show significant down-regulation upon introduction of sox <dig> specific sirna into schwannoma cells. subsequent comparative genomics analyses led to potential binding sites for sox <dig> protein conserved across several mammalian species within the genomic region proximal to these genes. multiple sites belonging to  <dig> different genes  were shown to directly interact with sox <dig> by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. we further confirmed the direct regulation through the identified cis-element for one of the genes, extracellular superoxide dismutase, using electrophoretic mobility shift assay and reporter assay.


CONCLUSIONS
in sum, the process of combining differential expression profiling and comparative genomics successfully led to further defining the role of sox <dig>  a critical transcription factor for the development of peripheral glia. our strategy utilizing relatively accessible techniques and tools should be applicable to studying the function of other transcription factors.
