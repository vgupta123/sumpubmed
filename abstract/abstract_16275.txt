BACKGROUND
the erbb2/her2/neu receptor tyrosine kinase is amplified in ~30% of human breast cancers. phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor, eif2α inhibits global protein synthesis and activates a stress signaling and growth suppressive program. we have shown that forced phosphorylation of eif2α can suppress head and neck, colorectal carcinoma and multiple myeloma tumor growth and/or survival. here we explore whether erbb <dig> modulates eif2α phosphorylation and whether forced phosphorylation of the latter can antagonize erbb <dig> deregulation of mammary acinar morphogenesis.


RESULTS
we tested whether erbb <dig> signaling influenced eif2α signaling and whether enhanced phosphorylation of the latter affected erbb2-deregulated mammary acinar development. we obtained stable mcf10a cells overexpressing wild-type  neu/erbb <dig> or a constitutively active  variant via retroviral delivery or mammary tumor cells from mmtv-neu tumors. western blotting, rt-pcr and confocal microscopy were used to analyze the effects of erbb <dig> activation on eif2α signaling and the effect of the gadd34-pp1c inhibitor salubrinal. wt- and mmtv-neu cells formed aberrant acini structures resembling dcis, while ca-erbb <dig> overexpression induced invasive lesions. in these structures we found that ca-erbb <dig> but not the wt variant significantly down-regulated the pro-apoptotic gene chop. this occurred without apparent modulation of basal phosphorylation of perk and eif2α or induction of its downstream target atf <dig>  however, inhibition of eif2α dephosphorylation with salubrinal was sufficient to inhibit wt- and ca-erbb2- as well as mmtv-neu-induced deregulation of acinar growth. this was linked to enhanced chop expression, inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis and luminal clearing in wt-erbb <dig> and to inhibition of cyclin d <dig> levels and subsequent proliferation in ca-erbb <dig> cells.


CONCLUSIONS
depending on the strength of erbb <dig> signaling there is a differential regulation of chop and eif2α phosphorylation. erbb <dig> uncouples in basal conditions eif2α phosphorylation from chop induction. however, this signal was restored by salubrinal treatment in wt-erbb <dig> expressing mcf10a cells as these dcis-like structures underwent luminal clearing. in ca-erbb <dig> structures apoptosis is not induced by salubrinal and instead a state of quiescence with reduced proliferation was achieved. treatments that stabilize p-eif2α levels may be effective in treating erbb <dig> positive cancers without severely disrupting normal tissue function and structure.
