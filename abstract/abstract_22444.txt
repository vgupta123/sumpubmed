BACKGROUND
in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, the phx1+  gene was initially isolated as a multi-copy suppressor of lysine auxotrophy caused by depletion of copper/zinc-containing superoxide dismutase . overproduction of phx <dig> increased the synthesis of homocitrate synthase, the first enzyme in lysine biosynthetic pathway, which is labile to oxidative stress. phx <dig> has a well conserved dna-binding domain called homeodomain at the n-terminal region and is predicted to be a transcription factor in s. pombe. however, its role has not been revealed in further detail. here we examined its expression pattern and the phenotype of its null mutant to get clues on its function.


RESULTS
fluorescence from the phx1-gfp expressed from a chromosomal fusion gene demonstrated that it is localized primarily in the nucleus, and is distinctly visible during the stationary phase. when we replaced the n-terminal homeobox domain of phx <dig> with the dna binding domain of pap <dig>  a well-characterized transcription factor, the chimeric protein caused the elevation of transcripts from pap1-dependent genes such as ctt1+ and trr1+, suggesting that phx <dig> possesses transcriptional activating activity when bound to dna. the amount of phx1+ transcripts sharply increased as cells entered the stationary phase and was maintained at high level throughout the stationary phase. nutrient shift down to low nitrogen or carbon sources caused phx1+ induction during the exponential phase, suggesting that cells need phx <dig> for maintenance function during nutrient starvation. the Δphx <dig> null mutant showed decreased viability in long-term culture, whereas overproduction of phx <dig> increased viability. decrease in long-term survival was also observed for Δphx <dig> under n- or c-starved conditions. in addition, Δphx <dig> mutant was more sensitive to various oxidants and heat shock. when we examined sporulation of the Δphx1/Δphx <dig> diploid strain, significant decrease in the formation of meiotic spores was observed.


CONCLUSIONS
phx <dig> is a transcriptional regulator whose synthesis is elevated during stationary phase and by nutrient starvation in s. pombe. it supports long-term survival and stress tolerance against oxidation and heat, and plays a key role in the formation of meiotic spores.
