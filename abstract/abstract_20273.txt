BACKGROUND
streptococcus agalactiae  is a common pathogen to infect newborn, woman, the elderly, and immuno-compromised human and fish.  <dig> fish isolates and  <dig> human isolates of the gbs in 2007– <dig> were investigated in serotypes, antibiotic susceptibility, genetic difference and pathogenicity to tilapia.


RESULTS
pcr serotyping determined serotype ia for all fish gbs isolates and only in  <dig>  %  human isolates. for fish isolates, all consisted a plasmid less than 6 kb and belonged to st <dig> type, which includes mainly pulsotypes i and ia, with a difference in a deletion at the largest dna fragment. these fish isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested in  <dig> and increased in non-susceptibility to penicillin, and resistance to clindamycin and ceftriaxone in  <dig>  differing in pulsotype and lacking plasmid from fish isolates, human serotype ia isolates were separated into eight pulsotypes ii–ix. main clone st <dig> included pulsotypes ii and iia  and st <dig> consisted of pulsotype iii. human serotype ia isolates were all susceptible to ceftriaxone and penicillin and few were resistant to erythromycin, azithromycin, clindamycin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacine with the resistant rate of 20 % or less. using tilapia to analyze the pathogenesis, fish isolates could cause more severe symptoms, including hemorrhage of the pectoral fin, hemorrhage of the gill, and viscous black and common scites, and mortality  than the human isolates ; however, the fish pulostype ia isolate  <dig> with deletion caused less symptoms and the lowest mortality  than pulsotype i isolates.


CONCLUSIONS
genetic, pathogenic, and antimicrobial differences demonstrate diverse origin of human and fish serotype ia isolates. the pulsotype ia of fish serotype ia isolates may be used as vaccine strains to prevent the gbs infection in fish.
