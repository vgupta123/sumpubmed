BACKGROUND
the ongoing efforts to sequence the honey bee genome require additional initiatives to define its transcriptome. towards this end, we employed the open reading frame ests  strategy to generate profiles for the life cycle of apis mellifera workers.


RESULTS
of the  <dig>  orestes,  <dig> % matched with previously deposited apis ests. the analysis of the remaining sequences defined a set of putative orthologs whose majority had their best-match hits with anopheles and drosophila genes. cap <dig> assembly of the apis orestes with the already existing  <dig>  apis ests generated  <dig>  contigs. blastx comparison of these contigs with protein sets of organisms representing distinct phylogenetic clades revealed a total of  <dig>  contigs that apis mellifera shares with different taxa. most  represent genes that are in common to all taxa, another 21% are shared between metazoans , and 16% are shared only within the insecta clade. a set of  <dig> putative genes presented a best match with human genes, many of which encode factors related to cell signaling/signal transduction.  <dig>  contigs  did not match any known sequence. applying a correction factor deduced from a parallel analysis performed with drosophila melanogaster orestes, we estimate that approximately half of these no-match ests contigs  should represent apis-specific genes.


CONCLUSIONS
the versatile and cost-efficient orestes approach produced minilibraries for honey bee life cycle stages. such information on central gene regions contributes to genome annotation and also lends itself to cross-transcriptome comparisons to reveal evolutionary trends in insect genomes.
