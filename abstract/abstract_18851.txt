BACKGROUND
dirs1-like elements compose one superfamily of tyrosine recombinase-encoding retrotransposons. they have been previously reported in only a few diverse eukaryote species, describing a patchy distribution, and little is known about their origin and dynamics. recently, we have shown that these retrotransposons are common among decapods, which calls into question the distribution of dirs1-like retrotransposons among eukaryotes.


RESULTS
to determine the distribution of dirs1-like retrotransposons, we developed a new computational tool, redost, which allows us to identify well-conserved dirs1-like elements. by screening  <dig> completely sequenced genomes, we identified more than  <dig> dirs1-like copies distributed among  <dig> diverse species which can be clustered into roughly  <dig> families. while the diversity in most species appears restricted to a low copy number, a few bursts of transposition are strongly suggested in certain species, such as danio rerio and saccoglossus kowalevskii.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we report  <dig> new species and  <dig> new higher taxa that were not previously known to harbor dirs1-like retrotransposons. now reported in  <dig> species, these elements appear widely distributed among eukaryotes, even if they remain undetected in streptophytes and mammals. especially in unikonts, a broad range of taxa from cnidaria to sauropsida harbors such elements. both the distribution and the similarities between the dirs1-like element phylogeny and conventional phylogenies of the host species suggest that dirs1-like retrotransposons emerged early during the radiation of eukaryotes.
