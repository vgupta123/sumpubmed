BACKGROUND
tocopherols, which are vitamin e compounds, play an important role in maintaining human health. compared with other staple foods, maize grains contain high level of tocopherols.


RESULTS
two f <dig> populations , which share a common parent , were developed and genotyped using a goldengate assay containing  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphism  markers. an integrated genetic linkage map was constructed using  <dig> snp markers, spanning a total of  <dig>  cm of the maize genome with an average interval of  <dig>  cm. seventeen quantitative trait loci  for all the traits were detected in the first map and  <dig> in the second. in these two maps, qtls for different traits were localized to the same genomic regions and some were co-located with candidate genes in the tocopherol biosynthesis pathway. single qtl was responsible for  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation and the qtls in sum explained <dig> % to  <dig> % of the total phenotypic variation. a major qtl  affecting α-tocopherol  was identified on chromosome  <dig> between the pza <dig>  and pza <dig>  in the pop- <dig>  the qtl region was narrowed down from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb by estimating the recombination using high-density markers of the qtl region. this allowed the identification of the candidate gene vte <dig> which encodes γ-tocopherol methyltransferase, an enzyme that transforms γ-tocopherol to αt.


CONCLUSIONS
these results demonstrate that a few qtls with major effects and several qtls with medium to minor effects might contribute to the natural variation of tocopherols in maize grain. the high-density markers will help to fine map and identify the qtls with major effects even in the preliminary segregating populations. furthermore, this study provides a simple guide line for the breeders to improve traits that minimize the risk of malnutrition, especially in developing countries.
