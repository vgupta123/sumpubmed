BACKGROUND
the smith-waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment is more sensitive than heuristic methods for database searching, but also more time-consuming. the fastest approach to parallelisation with simd technology has previously been described by farrar in  <dig>  the aim of this study was to explore whether further speed could be gained by other approaches to parallelisation.


RESULTS
a faster approach and implementation is described and benchmarked. in the new tool swipe, residues from sixteen different database sequences are compared in parallel to one query residue. using a  <dig> residue query sequence a speed of  <dig> billion cell updates per second  was achieved on a dual intel xeon x <dig> six-core processor system, which is over six times more rapid than software based on farrar's 'striped' approach. swipe was about  <dig>  times faster when the programs used only a single thread. for shorter queries, the increase in speed was larger. swipe was about twice as fast as blast when using the blosum <dig> score matrix, while blast was about twice as fast as swipe for the blosum <dig> matrix. the software is designed for  <dig> bit linux on processors with ssse <dig>  source code is available from http://dna.uio.no/swipe/ under the gnu affero general public license.


CONCLUSIONS
efficient parallelisation using simd on standard hardware makes it possible to run smith-waterman database searches more than six times faster than before. the approach described here could significantly widen the potential application of smith-waterman searches. other applications that require optimal local alignment scores could also benefit from improved performance.
