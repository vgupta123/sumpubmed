BACKGROUND
in this study, we present evidence that proteins encoded by the locus of enterocyte effacement , considered critical for escherichia coli o <dig>  adherence to follicle-associated epithelial  cells at the bovine recto-anal junction , do not appear to contribute to o <dig> adherence to squamous epithelial  cells also constituting this primary site of o <dig> colonization in cattle.


RESULTS
antisera targeting intimin-γ, the primary o <dig> adhesin, and other essential lee proteins failed to block o <dig> adherence to rse cells, when this pathogen was grown in dmem, a culture medium that enhances expression of lee proteins. in addition, rse adherence of a dmem-grown-o <dig> mutant lacking the intimin protein was comparable to that seen with its wild-type parent o <dig> strain grown in the same media. these adherence patterns were in complete contrast to that observed with hep- <dig> cells , assayed under same conditions. this suggested that proteins other than intimin-γ that contribute to adherence to rse cells are expressed by this pathogen during growth in dmem. to identify such proteins, we defined the proteome of dmem-grown-o <dig> . gelc-ms/ms revealed that the o <dig> dmem-proteome comprised  <dig> proteins including several components of the cattle and human o <dig> immunome, orthologs of adhesins, hypothetical secreted and outer membrane proteins, in addition to the known virulence and lee proteins. bioinformatics-based analysis of the components of the o <dig> dmem proteome revealed several new o157-specific proteins with adhesin potential.


CONCLUSIONS
proteins other than lee and intimin-γ proteins are involved in o <dig> adherence to rse cells at the bovine raj. such proteins, with adhesin potential, are expressed by this human pathogen during growth in dmem. ongoing experiments to evaluate their role in rse adherence should provide both valuable insights into the o157-rse interactions and new targets for more efficacious anti-adhesion o <dig> vaccines.
