BACKGROUND
single nucleotide polymorphism  based association studies aim at identifying snps associated with phenotypes, for example, complex diseases. the associated snps may influence the disease risk individually  or behave jointly . for the analysis of high throughput data, the main difficulty is that the number of snps far exceeds the number of samples. this difficulty is amplified when identifying interactions.


RESULTS
in this paper, we propose an adaptive group lasso  model for large-scale association studies. our model enables us to analyze snps and their interactions simultaneously. we achieve this by introducing a sparsity constraint in our model based on the fact that only a small fraction of snps is disease-associated. in order to reduce the number of false positive findings, we develop an adaptive reweighting scheme to enhance sparsity. in addition, our method treats snps and their interactions as factors, and identifies them in a grouped manner. thus, it is flexible to analyze various disease models, especially for interaction detection. however, due to the intensive computation when millions of interaction terms needs to be searched in the model fitting, our method needs to combined with some filtering methods when applied to genome-wide data for detecting interactions.


CONCLUSIONS
by using a wide range of simulated datasets and a real dataset from wtccc, we demonstrate the advantages of our method.
