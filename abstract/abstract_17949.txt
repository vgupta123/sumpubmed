BACKGROUND
the cyclin-dependent kinase  inhibitor p27kip <dig> is downregulated in a majority of human cancers due to ectopic proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. the expression of p <dig> is subject to multiple mechanisms of control involving several transcription factors, kinase pathways and at least three different ubiquitin ligases , which regulate p <dig> transcription, translation, protein stability and subcellular localization. using a chemical genetics approach, we have asked whether this control network can be modulated by small molecules such that p <dig> protein expression is restored in cancer cells.


RESULTS
we developed a cell-based assay for measuring the levels of endogenous nuclear p <dig> in a high throughput screening format employing lncap prostate cancer cells engineered to overexpress skp <dig>  the assay platform was optimized to z' factors of  <dig>  -  <dig>  and piloted by screening a total of  <dig> chemical compounds. during the course of this work, we discovered two small molecules of previously unknown biological activity, smip <dig> and smip <dig>  which increase the nuclear level of p <dig> at low micromolar concentrations. smips  also upregulate p21cip <dig>  inhibit cellular cdk <dig> activity, induce g <dig> delay, inhibit colony formation in soft agar and exhibit preferential cytotoxicity in lncap cells relative to normal human fibroblasts. unlike smip <dig>  smip <dig> was found to downregulate skp <dig> and to stabilize p <dig>  although neither smip is a proteasome inhibitor. whereas the screening endpoint - nuclear p <dig> - was robustly modulated by the compounds, smip-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were not strictly dependent on p <dig> and p <dig> - a finding that is explained by parallel inhibitory effects of smips on positive cell cycle regulators, including cyclins e and a, and cdk <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our data provide proof-of-principle that the screening platform we developed, using endogenous nuclear p <dig> as an endpoint, presents an effective means of identifying bioactive molecules with cancer selective antiproliferative activity. this approach, when applied to larger and more diverse sets of compounds with refined drug-like properties, bears the potential of revealing both unknown cellular pathways globally impinging on p <dig> and novel leads for chemotherapeutics targeting a prominent molecular defect of human cancers.
