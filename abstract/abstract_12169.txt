BACKGROUND
the phospholipids of the plant plasma membrane are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum . the majority of these lipids reach the plasma membrane independently of the secretory vesicular pathway. phospholipid delivery to the mitochondria and chloroplasts of plant cells also bypasses the secretory pathway and here it has been proposed that lysophospholipids are transported at contact sites between specific regions of the er and the respective organelle, followed by lysophospholipid acylation in the target organelle. to test the hypothesis that a corresponding mechanism operates to transport phospholipids to the plasma membrane outside the secretory pathway, we investigated whether lysolipid acylation occurs also in the plant plasma membrane and whether this membrane, like the chloroplasts and mitochondria, is in close contact with the er.


RESULTS
the plant plasma membrane readily incorporated the acyl chain of acyl-coa into phospholipids. oleic acid was preferred over palmitic acid as substrate and acyl incorporation occurred predominantly into phosphatidylcholine . phospholipase a <dig> stimulated the reaction, as did exogenous lysopc when administered in above critical micellar concentrations. agno <dig> was inhibitory. the lysophospholipid acylation reaction was higher in a membrane fraction that could be washed off the isolated plasma membranes after repeated freezing and thawing cycles in a medium with lowered ph. this fraction exhibited several er-like characteristics. when plasma membranes isolated from transgenic arabidopsis expressing green fluorescent protein in the er lumen were observed by confocal microscopy, membranes of er origin were associated with the isolated plasma membranes.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that a lysopc acylation activity is associated with plant plasma membranes and cannot exclude a pc transacylase activity. it is highly plausible that the enzyme resides in a fraction of the er, closely associated with the plasma membrane, or in both. we suggest that this fraction might be the equivalent of the mitochondria associated membrane of er origin that delivers phospholipids to the mitochondria, and to the recently isolated er-derived membrane fraction that is in close contact with chloroplasts. the in situ function of the lysopc acylation/pc transacylase activity is unknown, but involvement in lipid delivery from the er to the plasma membrane is suggested.
