BACKGROUND
echocardiography and intra-cardiac dimensions have not previously been reported in adult camels despite its potential application for medical purpose. the aim of this study was to describe the results of a prospective study, aiming to report normal cardiac appearance and normal chamber dimensions in adult camels .


RESULTS
on the right side, when the probe was placed in the 5th or 4th intercostal space , the caudal long-axis four-chamber view of the ventricles, atria, and the interventricular septum was obtained. placing the probe slightly more cranially in the 4th ics, the caudal long-axis four-chamber view and the caudal long-axis view of the left ventricular outflow tract  were imaged. in  <dig> camels, a hybrid view between a “four-chamber” and “lvot view” was imaged from the same position. the short-axis view of the ventricles was obtained in the 4th ics where the transducer was rotated between 0° and 25°. placement of the transducer in the 3rd ics allowed visualisation of the right ventricular outflow tract . on the left side, when the probe was placed in the 5th or 4th ics, a four-chamber view was obtained. the lvot is imaged in the 4th ics and the rvot was seen from the 3rd ics.


CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that it is possible to obtain good-quality echocardiograms in adult camels and provide normal cardiac dimensions. this study could be used as a reference for further studies concerning camels with cardiac diseases.
