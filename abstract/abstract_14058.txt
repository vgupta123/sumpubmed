BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae causes several human diseases, including pneumonia and meningitis, in which pathology is associated with an excessive inflammatory response. a major inducer of this response is the cholesterol dependent pneumococcal toxin, pneumolysin. here, we measured the amount of inflammatory cytokine cxcl <dig> -8) by elisa released by human nasopharyngeal epithelial  cells as inflammatory response to a 24 h exposure to different pneumococcal strains.


RESULTS
we found pneumolysin to be the major factor influencing the cxcl <dig> response. cholesterol and sphingomyelin-containing liposomes designed to sequester pneumolysin were highly effective at reducing cxcl <dig> levels from epithelial cells exposed to different clinical pneumococcal isolates. these liposomes also reduced cxcl <dig> response from epithelial cells exposed to pneumolysin knock-out mutants of s. pneumoniae indicating that they also reduce the cxcl8-inducing effect of an unidentified pneumococcal virulence factor, in addition to pneumolysin.


CONCLUSIONS
the results indicate the potential of liposomes in attenuating excessive inflammation as a future adjunctive treatment of pneumococcal diseases.
