BACKGROUND
previous studies have indicated that selenium supplementation may be beneficial in neuroprotection against glutamate-induced cell damage, in which mitochondrial dysfunction is considered a major pathogenic feature. however, the exact mechanisms by which selenium protects against glutamate-provoked mitochondrial perturbation remain ambiguous. in this study glutamate exposed murine hippocampal neuronal ht <dig> cell was used as a model to investigate the underlying mechanisms of selenium-dependent protection against mitochondria damage.


RESULTS
we find that glutamate-induced cytotoxicity was associated with enhancement of superoxide production, activation of caspase- <dig> and - <dig>  increases of mitochondrial fission marker and mitochondrial morphological changes. selenium significantly resolved the glutamate-induced mitochondria structural damage, alleviated oxidative stress, decreased apaf- <dig>  caspases- <dig> and - <dig> contents, and altered the autophagy process as observed by a decline in the ratio of the autophagy markers lc3-i and lc3-ii.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that the protection of selenium against glutamate stimulated cell damage of ht <dig> cells is associated with amelioration of mitochondrial dynamic imbalance.
