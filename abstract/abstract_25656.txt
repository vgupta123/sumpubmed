BACKGROUND
cryptophytes are highly compartmentalized organisms, expressing a secondary minimized eukaryotic genome in the nucleomorph and its surrounding remnant cytoplasm, in addition to the cell nucleus, the mitochondrion and the plastid. because the members of the nucleomorph-encoded proteome may contribute to essential cellular pathways, elucidating nucleomorph-encoded functions is of utmost interest. unfortunately, cryptophytes are inaccessible for genetic transformations thus far. therefore the functions of nucleomorph-encoded proteins must be elucidated indirectly by application of methods in genetically accessible organisms.


RESULTS
orf <dig>  one of the uncharacterized nucleomorph-specific open reading frames of the cryptophyte guillardia theta, shows homology to slr <dig> of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  recently a further homolog from synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig> was characterized to encode a phycocyanin-β155-bilin lyase. here we show by insertion mutagenesis that the synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> slr1649-encoded protein also acts as a bilin lyase, and additionally contributes to linker attachment and/or stability of phycobilisomes. finally, our results indicate that the phycocyanin-β155-bilin lyase of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> can be complemented in vivo by the nucleomorph-encoded open reading frame orf <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our data show that the loss of phycocyanin-lyase function causes pleiotropic effects in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> and indicate that after separating from a common ancestor protein, the phycoerythrin lyase from guillardia theta has retained its capacity to couple a bilin group to other phycobiliproteins. this is a further, unexpected example of the universality of phycobiliprotein lyases.
