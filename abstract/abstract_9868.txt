BACKGROUND
offspring of pregnancy complicated with preeclampsia are at high risk for hypertension, stroke and possibly obesity. the mechanisms behind the association of intrauterine exposure to preeclampsia and high risk of health problems in the later life remain largely unknown. the aims of the current investigation were to determine the changes in dna methylation at igf <dig> and gnas dmr in offspring of preeclamptic pregnancy and to explore the possible mechanisms underlying the association between maternal preeclampsia and high risk for health problems in the later life of their offspring.


RESULTS
umbilical cord blood was taken from infants born to women of preeclampsia , gestational hypertension  and normal pregnancy . dna methylation levels of igf <dig> and gnas dmr were determined by massarray quantitative methylation analysis. methylation levels at igf <dig> dmr were significantly lower in preeclampsia than normal pregnancy. the average methylation level at igf <dig> dmr was significantly correlated with preeclampsia even after birth weight, maternal age, gestational age at delivery and fetal gender were adjusted. the difference in methylation level was not significantly different between mild and severe preeclampsia. the methylation level at gnas dmr was not significantly correlated with birth weight, maternal age, gestational age at delivery, fetal gender, preeclampsia or gestational hypertension.


CONCLUSIONS
we concluded preeclampsia induced a decrease in methylation level at igf  <dig> dmr, and this might be among the mechanisms behind the association between intrauterine exposure to preeclampsia and high risk for metabolic diseases in the later life of the infants.
