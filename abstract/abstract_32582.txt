BACKGROUND
neurofibromatosis type  <dig>  is a common dominant tumor predisposition syndrome affecting  <dig> in  <dig>  individuals. the hallmarks of nf <dig> are the development of peripheral nerve sheath tumors either benign  or malignant .


RESULTS
to comprehensively characterize the role of micrornas in nf <dig> tumorigenesis, we analyzed  <dig> mirnas expression in a large panel of dermal and plexiform neurofibromas, and mpnsts. the most significantly upregulated mirna in plexiform neurofibromas was mir-486-3p that targets the major tumor suppressor gene, pten. we confirmed pten downregulation at mrna level. in plexiform neurofibromas, we also report aberrant expression of four mirnas involved in the ras-mapk pathway . in mpnsts, significant deregulated mirnas were involved in pten repression , ras-mapk pathway regulation , mesenchymal transition , hox genes expression , and cell cycle progression .


CONCLUSIONS
we confirmed the implication of pten in genesis of plexiform neurofibromas and mpnsts in nf <dig>  markedly deregulated mirnas might have potential diagnostic or prognostic value and could represent novel strategies for effective pharmacological therapies of nf <dig> tumors.
