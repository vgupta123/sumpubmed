BACKGROUND
domoic acid  is an excitatory amino acid analogue of kainic acid  that acts via activation of glutamate receptors to elicit a rapid and potent excitotoxic response, resulting in neuronal cell death. recently, da was shown to elicit reactive oxygen species  production and induce apoptosis accompanied by activation of p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase  in vitro. we have reported that wdr <dig>  a wd-repeat protein, may mediate apoptosis in several animal models. in the present study, we administered da to rats intraperitoneally, then used liquid chromatography/ion trap tandem mass spectrometry  to identify and quantify da in the brains of the rats and performed histological examinations of the hippocampus. we further investigated the potential involvement of glutamate receptors, ros, p <dig> mapk, and wdr <dig> in da-induced toxicity in vivo.


RESULTS
our results showed that intraperitoneally administered da was present in the brain and induced neurodegenerative changes including apoptosis in the ca <dig> region of the hippocampus. da also increased the expression of wdr <dig> mrna and protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner in the hippocampus. in experiments using glutamate receptor antagonists, the ampa/ka receptor antagonist nbqx significantly attenuated the da-induced increase in wdr <dig> protein expression, but the nmda receptor antagonist mk- <dig> did not. in addition, the radical scavenger edaravone significantly attenuated the da-induced increase in wdr <dig> protein expression. furthermore, nbqx and edaravone significantly attenuated the da-induced increase in p <dig> mapk phosphorylation.


CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results indicated that da activated ampa/ka receptors and induced ros production and p <dig> mapk phosphorylation, resulting in an increase in the expression of wdr <dig> in vivo.
