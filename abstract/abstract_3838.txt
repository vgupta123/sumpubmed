BACKGROUND
nac domain transcription factors initiate secondary cell wall biosynthesis in arabidopsis fibres and vessels by activating numerous transcriptional regulators and biosynthetic genes. nac family member snd <dig> is an indirect target of a principal regulator of fibre secondary cell wall formation, snd <dig>  a previous study showed that overexpression of snd <dig> produced a fibre cell-specific increase in secondary cell wall thickness in arabidopsis stems, and that the protein was able to transactivate the cellulose synthase <dig>  promoter. however, the full repertoire of genes regulated by snd <dig> is unknown, and the effect of its overexpression on cell wall chemistry remains unexplored.


RESULTS
we overexpressed snd <dig> in arabidopsis and analyzed homozygous lines with regards to stem chemistry, biomass and fibre secondary cell wall thickness. a line showing upregulation of cesa <dig> was selected for transcriptome-wide gene expression profiling. we found evidence for upregulation of biosynthetic genes associated with cellulose, xylan, mannan and lignin polymerization in this line, in agreement with significant co-expression of these genes with native snd <dig> transcripts according to public microarray repositories. only minor alterations in cell wall chemistry were detected. transcription factor myb <dig>  in addition to snd <dig>  was upregulated in snd2-overexpressing plants, and we detected upregulation of genes encoding components of a signal transduction machinery recently proposed to initiate secondary cell wall formation. several homozygous t <dig> and hemizygous t <dig> transgenic lines with pronounced snd <dig> overexpression levels revealed a negative impact on fibre wall deposition, which may be indirectly attributable to excessive overexpression rather than co-suppression. conversely, overexpression of snd <dig> in eucalyptus stems led to increased fibre cross-sectional cell area.


CONCLUSIONS
this study supports a function for snd <dig> in the regulation of cellulose and hemicellulose biosynthetic genes in addition of those involved in lignin polymerization and signalling. snd <dig> seems to occupy a subordinate but central tier in the secondary cell wall transcriptional network. our results reveal phenotypic differences in the effect of snd <dig> overexpression between woody and herbaceous stems and emphasize the importance of expression thresholds in transcription factor studies.
