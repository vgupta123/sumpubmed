BACKGROUND
arachidonic acid  is important for human health because it is one of the major components of mammalian brain membrane phospholipids. the interest in ara inspired the search for a new sustainable source, and the green microalga myrmecia incisa reisigl h <dig> has been found a potential ara-producer due to a high content of intracellular ara. to gain more molecular information about metabolism pathways, including the biosynthesis of ara in the non-model microalga, a transcriptomic analysis was performed.


RESULTS
the  <dig> pyrosequencing generated  <dig>  high-quality reads, which were assembled into  <dig>  unique sequences consisting of  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. a total of  <dig>  unique sequences were annotated through blast analysis, and  <dig>  were assigned to gene ontology  categories. kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway analysis uncovered a c4-like photosynthesis pathway in m. incisa. the biosynthesis pathways of lipid particularly those of ara and triacylglycerol  were analyzed in detail, and tag was proposed to be accumulated in oil bodies in the cytosol with the help of caleosin or oil globule-associated proteins. in addition, the carotenoid biosynthesis pathways are discussed.


CONCLUSIONS
this transcriptomic analysis of m. incisa enabled a global understanding of mechanisms involved in photosynthesis, de novo biosynthesis of ara, metabolism of carotenoids, and accumulation of tag in m. incisa. these findings provided a molecular basis for the research and possibly economic exploitation of this ara-rich microalga.
