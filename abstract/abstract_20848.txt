BACKGROUND
waxes are esters of long-chain fatty acids and long-chain alcohols. their principal natural sources are animals  and vegetables  which are expensive and not easily available. wax esters synthesized by enzymatic transesterification, using palm stearin as raw material, can be considered as an alternative to natural ones.


RESULTS
palm stearin is a solid fraction obtained by fractionation of palm oil. palm stearin was esterified with cetyl alcohol to produce a mixture of wax esters. a non-commercial immobilized lipase from rhizopus oryzae was used as biocatalyst. response surface methodology was employed to determine the effects of the temperature , the enzyme concentration , the alcohol/palm stearin molar ratio  and the substrate concentration  on the conversion yield of palm stearin. under optimal conditions  a high conversion yield of  <dig> % was reached within a reaction time of  <dig> h.


CONCLUSIONS
response surface methodology was successfully applied to determine the optimum operational conditions for synthesis of palm stearin based wax esters. this study may provide useful tools to develop economical and efficient processes for the synthesis of wax esters.
