BACKGROUND
in endothelial cells , transforming growth factor-β  can bind to and transduce signals through alk <dig> and alk <dig>  the tgf-β/alk <dig> and tgf-β/alk <dig> pathways have opposite effects on ec behaviour. besides differential receptor binding, the duration of tgf-β signaling is an important specificity determinant for signaling responses. tgf-β/alk1-induced smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation in ecs occurs transiently.


RESULTS
the temporal activation of tgf-β-induced smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation in ecs was found to be affected by de novo protein synthesis, and alk <dig> and smad <dig> expression levels determined signal strength of tgf-β/alk <dig> signaling pathway. smad <dig> and protein phosphatase 1α  mrna expression levels were found to be specifically upregulated by tgf-β/alk <dig>  ectopic expression of smad <dig> or pp1α potently inhibited tgf-β/alk1-induced smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation in ecs. conversely, sirna-mediated knockdown of smad <dig> or pp1α enhanced tgf-β/alk1-induced signaling responses. pp1α interacted with alk <dig> and this association was further potentiated by smad <dig>  dephosphorylation of the alk <dig>  immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, was attenuated by a specific pp <dig> inhibitor.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that upon its induction by the tgf-β/alk <dig> pathway, smad <dig> may recruit pp1α to alk <dig>  and thereby control tgf-β/alk1-induced smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation.
