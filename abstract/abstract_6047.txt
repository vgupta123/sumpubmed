BACKGROUND
many population genetic and phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial dna  assume that mitochondrial genomes do not undergo recombination. recently, concerted evolution of duplicated mitochondrial control regions has been documented in a range of taxa. although the molecular mechanism that facilitates concerted evolution is unknown, all proposed mechanisms involve mtdna recombination.


RESULTS
here, we document a duplication of a large region  in the mitochondrial genome of three related seabird species. to investigate the evolution of duplicate control regions, we sequenced both control region copies  from  <dig> brown ,  <dig> red-footed  and  <dig> blue-footed boobies . phylogenetic analysis suggested that the duplicated control regions are predominantly evolving in concert; however, approximately  <dig> base pairs at the 5' end of cr <dig> and cr <dig> exhibited a discordant phylogenetic signal and appeared to be evolving independently.


CONCLUSIONS
both the structure of the duplicated region and the conflicting phylogenetic signals are remarkably similar to a pattern found in thalassarche albatrosses, which are united with boobies in a large clade that includes all procellariiform and most pelecaniform seabirds. therefore we suggest that concerted evolution of duplicated control regions either is taxonomically widespread within seabirds, or that it has evolved many times.
