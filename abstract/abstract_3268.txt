BACKGROUND
cd8+ regulatory t cells  have been considered to be involved in a model of ocular-induced tolerance, known as anterior chamber-associated immune deviation . the phenotype and characteristics of cd8+treg in acaid remain only poorly understood. recent studies have reported that the cd94-qa- <dig> system is implicated in the induction of acaid cd8+treg, but the functions and characteristics of cd8+cd94+t cells remain unclear.


RESULTS
both mrna and protein of cd <dig> and nkg2a were markedly up-regulated on splenic cd8+t cells of acaid mice compared with controls. flow cytometric analysis showed that very few cd8+cd94+t cells express granzyme b, perforin and foxp <dig>  cd8+cd94+t cells, but not cd8+cd94-t cells, magnetically isolated from the spleens of acaid mice, produced large amounts of tgf-beta <dig> and exhibited suppressive activity in vitro. neutralization of tgf-beta <dig> caused reversal of suppression mediated by cd8+cd94+t cells.


CONCLUSIONS
cd8+cd94+t cells from acaid mice exhibited suppressive activity in association with enhanced expression of tgf-beta <dig>  suggesting that cd8+treg are mainly distributed in cd94+t cell subpopulations.
