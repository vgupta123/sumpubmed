BACKGROUND
cartilage plays a fundamental role in the development of the human skeleton. early in embryogenesis, mesenchymal cells condense and differentiate into chondrocytes to shape the early skeleton. subsequently, the cartilage anlagen differentiate to form the growth plates, which are responsible for linear bone growth, and the articular chondrocytes, which facilitate joint function. however, despite the multiplicity of roles of cartilage during human fetal life, surprisingly little is known about its transcriptome. to address this, a whole genome microarray expression profile was generated using rna isolated from 18â€“ <dig> week human distal femur fetal cartilage and compared with a database of control normal human tissues aggregated at ucla, termed celsius.


RESULTS
 <dig> cartilage-selective genes were identified, defined as genes significantly expressed in cartilage with low expression and little variation across a panel of  <dig> non-cartilage tissues. among these  <dig> genes were cartilage-specific genes such as cartilage collagen genes and  <dig> genes which have been associated with skeletal phenotypes in humans and/or mice. many of the other cartilage-selective genes do not have established roles in cartilage or are novel, unannotated genes. quantitative rt-pcr confirmed the unique pattern of gene expression observed by microarray analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
defining the gene expression pattern for cartilage has identified new genes that may contribute to human skeletogenesis as well as provided further candidate genes for skeletal dysplasias. the data suggest that fetal cartilage is a complex and transcriptionally active tissue and demonstrate that the set of genes selectively expressed in the tissue has been greatly underestimated.
