BACKGROUND
yersinia enterocolitica is an enteric pathogen that invades the intestinal mucosa and proliferates within the lymphoid follicles . the attachment invasion locus  mediates invasion by y. enterocolitica and confers an invasive phenotype upon non-invasive e. coli; ail is the primary virulence factor of y. enterocolitica. the ferrioxamine receptor  located on the y. enterocolitica chromosome, together with its transport protein, transports a siderophore specific for ferric ion. currently, ail is the primary target gene for nucleic acid detection of pathogenic y. enterocolitica.


RESULTS
the genes ail and foxa in  <dig> pathogenic and  <dig> non-pathogenic y. enterocolitica strains isolated from china and  <dig> reference strains were sequenced, aligned, compared to the ail and foxa sequences of yersinia enterocolitica subsp. enterocolitica  <dig> , and analyzed for sequence polymorphism. the ail from the  <dig> strains showed  <dig> sequence patterns:  <dig> strains of serotypes o: <dig>  o: <dig> and o: <dig>   <dig> with identical nucleic acid sequences formed pattern a1;  <dig> strains of serotype 1b/o: <dig> with identical nucleic acid sequences formed pattern a2; and one chinese isolate 2/o: <dig> formed pattern a <dig>  in the primary coding region of the foxa orf , the sequences formed  <dig> groups and were further divided into  <dig> sequence patterns.


CONCLUSIONS
the ail and foxa loci of pathogenic y. enterocolitica have been analyzed. the ail sequence was highly conserved among the same serotype strains from different sources; and foxa was highly conserved among the pathogenic strains, although there was some sequence diversity. fewer strains were used from outside china, which is a limitation of the study.
