BACKGROUND
as we reported previously, getah virus infection occurred in horses at the miho training center of the japan racing association in  <dig>  this was the first outbreak after a 31-year absence in japan. here, we report a recurrent outbreak of getah virus infection in  <dig>  sequential to the  <dig> one at the same site, and we summarize its epizootiological aspects to estimate the risk of further outbreaks in upcoming years.


RESULTS
the outbreak occurred from mid-august to late october  <dig>  affecting  <dig> racehorses with a prevalence of  <dig>  % of the whole population . twenty-seven  of the  <dig> affected horses were 2-year-olds, and the prevalence in 2-year-olds  was significantly higher than that in horses aged 3 years or older . therefore, the horses newly introduced from other areas at this age were susceptible, whereas most horses aged 3 years or older, which had experienced the previous outbreak in  <dig>  were resistant. among the 2-year-olds, the prevalence in horses that had been vaccinated once  was significantly higher than that in horses vaccinated twice or more . horse anti-sera raised against an isolate in  <dig> neutralized both the homologous strain and a  <dig> isolate at almost the same titers , suggesting that these viruses were antigenically similar. among horses entering the training center from private surrounding farms in  <dig>  the seropositivity rate to getah virus increased gradually . thus, increased virus exposure due to the regional epizootic probably allowed the virus to spread in the center, similarly to the outbreak in  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the  <dig> outbreak was caused by a virus which was antigenically close to the  <dig> isolate, affecting mostly 2-year-old susceptible horses under epizootiological circumstances similar to those in  <dig>  the existence of 2-year-olds introduced from regions free from getah virus could continue to pose a potential risk of additional outbreaks in upcoming years. vaccination on private farms and breeding farms would help to minimize the risk of outbreaks.
