BACKGROUND
obesity is a chronic low inflammatory state. in the obesity condition the white adipose tissue  is massively infiltrated with monocytes/macrophages, and the nature of the signals recruiting these inflammatory cells has yet to be fully elucidated. haptoglobin  is an inflammatory marker and its expression is induced in the wat of obese subjects. in an effort to elucidate the biological significance of hp presence in the wat and of its upregulation in obesity we formulated the hypothesis that hp may serve as a macrophage chemoattractant.


RESULTS
we demonstrated by chemotaxis assay that hp is able to attract chemokine  receptor  <dig> -transfected pre-b lymphocytes and monocytes in a dose-dependent manner. moreover, hp-mediated migration of monocytes is impaired by ccr2-specific inhibition or previous cell exposure to monocyte chemoattractant protein  <dig>   ligand  <dig> ). downstream effects of hp/ccr <dig> interaction were also investigated: flow cytometry proved that monocytes treated with hp show reduced ccr <dig> expression on their surface; hp interaction induces calcium release that is reduced upon pretreatment with ccr <dig> antagonist; extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/ <dig>  a signal transducer activated by ccr <dig>  is phosphorylated following hp treatment and this phosphorylation is reduced when cells are pretreated with a specific ccr <dig> inhibitor. consistently, blocking the erk1/ <dig> pathway with u <dig>  the selective inhibitor of the erk upstream mitogen-activated protein -erk kinase , results in a dramatic reduction  of the capability of hp to induce monocyte migration.


CONCLUSIONS
our data show that hp is a novel monocyte chemoattractant and that its chemotactic potential is mediated, at least in part. by its interaction with ccr <dig>
