BACKGROUND
the regulation of the chloroplast antioxidant capacity depends on nuclear gene expression. for the 2-cys peroxiredoxin-a gene  a cis-regulatory element was recently characterized, which responds to photosynthetic redox signals.


RESULTS
in a yeast-one-hybrid screen for cis-regulatory binding proteins, the transcription factor rap <dig> a was isolated. rap <dig> a controls the transcript abundance of the prominent chloroplast antioxidant enzyme through binding to the cgcg core of a ce3-like element. rap <dig> a activity is regulated by dithiol/disulfide transition of regulatory cysteinyl residues and subsequent changes in the quaternary structure. the mid-point redox potential of rap <dig> a activation is - <dig> mv .


CONCLUSIONS
the redox sensitivity of rap <dig> a establishes an efficient switch mechanism for redox control of nuclear gene activity of chloroplast antioxidants, in which rap <dig>  is a redox-sensor and a transducer of redox information.
