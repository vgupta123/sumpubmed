BACKGROUND
cotton fiber length is an important quality attribute to the textile industry and longer fibers can be more efficiently spun into yarns to produce superior fabrics. there is typically a negative correlation between yield and fiber quality traits such as length. an understanding of the regulatory mechanisms controlling fiber length can potentially provide a valuable tool for cotton breeders to improve fiber length while maintaining high yields. the cotton  fiber mutation ligon lintless- <dig> is controlled by a single dominant gene  that results in significantly shorter fibers than a wild-type. in a near-isogenic state with a wild-type cotton line, li <dig> is a model system with which to study fiber elongation.


RESULTS
two near-isogenic lines of ligon lintless- <dig>  cotton, one mutant and one wild-type, were developed through five generations of backcrosses . an f <dig> population was developed from a cross between the two li <dig> near-isogenic lines and used to develop a linkage map of the li <dig> locus on chromosome  <dig>  five simple sequence repeat  markers were closely mapped around the li <dig> locus region with two of the markers flanking the li <dig> locus at  <dig>  and  <dig>  centimorgan. no apparent differences in fiber initiation and early fiber elongation were observed between the mutant ovules and the wild-type ones. gene expression profiling using microarrays suggested roles of reactive oxygen species  homeostasis and cytokinin regulation in the li <dig> mutant phenotype. microarray gene expression data led to successful identification of an est-ssr marker  that displayed complete linkage to the li <dig> locus.


CONCLUSIONS
in the field of cotton genomics, we report the first successful conversion of gene expression data into an ssr marker that is associated with a genomic region harboring a gene responsible for a fiber trait. the est-derived ssr marker nau <dig> displayed complete linkage to the li <dig> locus on chromosome  <dig> and resided in a gene with similarity to a putative plectin-related protein. the complete linkage suggests that this expressed sequence may be the li <dig> gene.
