BACKGROUND
in view of compliance with increasingly stringent environmental legislation, an eco-friendly treatment technology of industrial dyes and effluents is a major environmental challenge in the color industry. in present study, a promising and eco‐friendly entrapment approach was adopted to immobilize purified manganese peroxidase  produced from an indigenous strain of ganoderma lucidum ibl- <dig> on ca-alginate beads. the immobilized mnp was subsequently used for enhanced decolorization and detoxification of textile reactive dyes).


RESULTS
mnp isolated from solid-state culture of g. lucidum ibl- <dig>  presented highest immobilization yield  using alginate beads prepared at optimized conditions of  <dig> %  sodium alginate,  <dig> %  calcium chloride  and  <dig>  mg/ml enzyme concentration. immobilization of mnp enhanced optimum temperature but caused acidic shift in optimum ph of the enzyme. the immobilized mnp showed optimum activity at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> °c as compared to ph  <dig>  and  <dig> °c for free enzyme. the kinetic parameters km and vmax of mnp were significantly improved by immobilization. the enhanced catalytic potential of immobilized mnp led to  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig> % decolorization of sandal-fix red c4bln, sandal-fix turq blue gwf, sandal-fix foron blue e2bln, sandal-fix black ckf and sandal-fix golden yellow crl dyes, respectively. the insolubilized mnp was reusable for  <dig> repeated cycles in dye color removal. furthermore, immobilized mnp also caused a significant reduction in biochemical oxygen demand  , chemical oxygen demand  , and total organic carbon   of aqueous dye solutions.


CONCLUSIONS
g. lucidum mnp was immobilized in ca-alginate beads by entrapment method to improve its practical effectiveness. ca-alginate bound mnp was catalytically more vigorous, thermo-stable, reusable and worked over wider ranges of ph and temperature as compared to its free counterpart. results of cytotoxicity like hemolytic and brine shrimp lethality tests suggested that ca-alginate immobilized mnp may effectively be used for detoxification of dyes and industrial effluents.
