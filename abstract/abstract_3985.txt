BACKGROUND
mitotic terminally differentiated photoreceptors  are observed in early retinal degeneration , an inherited canine retinal disease driven by mutations in the ndr kinase stk38l .


RESULTS
we demonstrate that a similar proliferative response, but of lower magnitude, occurs in two other early onset disease models, x-linked progressive retinal atrophy  <dig>  and rod cone dysplasia  <dig> . proliferating cells are rod prs, and not microglia or müller cells. expression of the cell cycle related genes rb <dig> and e2f <dig> as well as cdk <dig> , <dig> was up-regulated, but changes were mutation-specific. changes in cyclin expression differed across all genes, diseases and time points analyzed, although ccna <dig> and ccne <dig> expression increased with age in the three models suggesting that there is a dysregulation of cell cycle gene expression in all three diseases. unique to erd, however, are mutation-specific changes in the expression of ndr kinases and hippo signaling members with increased expression of mob <dig> and lats <dig> in the newly generated hybrid rod/s-cones.


CONCLUSIONS
our data raise the intriguing possibility that terminally differentiated normal prs are kept from dividing by ndr2-mob <dig> interaction. furthermore, they provide the framework for the selection of candidate genes for further investigation as potential targets of therapy.
