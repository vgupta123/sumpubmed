BACKGROUND
treatment of plants with hrpnea, a protein of harpin group produced by gram-negative plant pathogenic bacteria, induces plant resistance to insect herbivores, including the green peach aphid myzus persicae, a generalist phloem-feeding insect. under attacks by phloem-feeding insects, plants defend themselves using the phloem-based defense mechanism, which is supposed to involve the phloem protein  <dig> , one of the most abundant proteins in the phloem sap. the purpose of this study was to obtain genetic evidence for the function of the arabidopsis thaliana  pp2-encoding gene atpp2-a <dig> in resistance to m. persicae when the plant was treated with hrpnea and after the plant was transformed with atpp2-a <dig> 


RESULTS
the electrical penetration graph technique was used to visualize the phloem-feeding activities of apterous agamic m. persicae females on leaves of arabidopsis plants treated with hrpnea and an inactive protein control, respectively. a repression of phloem feeding was induced by hrpnea in wild-type  arabidopsis but not in atpp2-a1/e/ <dig>  the plant mutant that had a defect in the atpp2-a <dig> gene, the most hrpnea-responsive of  <dig> atpp <dig> genes. in wt rather than atpp2-a1/e/ <dig>  the deterrent effect of hrpnea treatment on the phloem-feeding activity accompanied an enhancement of atpp2-a <dig> expression. in pp2oetat  plants, abundant amounts of the atpp2-a <dig> gene transcript were detected in different organs, including leaves, stems, calyces, and petals. all these organs had a deterrent effect on the phloem-feeding activity compared with the same organs of the transgenic control plant. when a large-scale aphid population was monitored for  <dig> hours, there was a significant decrease in the number of aphids that colonized leaves of hrpnea-treated wt and pp2oetat plants, respectively, compared with control plants.


CONCLUSIONS
the repression in phloem-feeding activities of m. persicae as a result of atpp2-a <dig> overexpression, and as a deterrent effect of hrpnea treatment in wt arabidopsis rather than the atpp2-a1/e/ <dig> mutant suggest that atpp2-a <dig> plays a role in plant resistance to the insect, particularly at the phloem-feeding stage. the accompanied change of aphid population in leaf colonies suggests that the function of atpp2-a <dig> is related to colonization of the plant.
