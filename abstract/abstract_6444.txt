BACKGROUND
dis <dig> is ribonuclease that acts directly in the processing, turnover, and surveillance of a large number of distinct rna species. evolutionarily conserved from eubacteria to eukaryotes and a crucial component of the rna processing exosome, dis <dig> has been shown to be essential in yeast and fly s <dig> cells. however, it is not known whether dis <dig> has essential functions in a metazoan. this study inquires whether dis <dig> is required for drosophila development and viability and how dis <dig> regulates the transcriptome in the developing fly.


RESULTS
using transgenic flies, we show that dis <dig> knock down  retards growth, induces melanotic tumor formation, and ultimately results in 2nd instar larval lethality. in order to determine whether dis3kd fly phenotypes were a consequence of disrupting developmentally regulated rna turnover, we performed rna deep sequencing analysis on total rna isolated from developmentally staged animals. bioinformatic analysis of transcripts from dis3kd flies reveals substantial transcriptomic changes, most notably down-regulation in early expressed rnas. finally, gene ontology analysis of this early stage shows that dis <dig> regulates transcripts related to extracellular structure and remodelling, neurogenesis, and nucleotide metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that dis <dig> is essential for early drosophila melanogaster development and has specific and important stage-specific roles in regulating rna metabolism. in showing for the first time that dis <dig> is required for the development of a multicellular organism, our work provides mechanistic insight into how dis3—either independent of or associated with the rna processing exosome—participates in cell type-specific rna turnover in metazoan development.
