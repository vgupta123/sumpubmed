BACKGROUND
wallerian degeneration  in injured peripheral nerves is associated with a large number of up- or down-regulated genes, but the effects of these changes are poorly understood. in our previous studies, we reported some key factors that are differentially expressed to activate nerve degeneration and regeneration during wd. here, we determined the effects of secreted phosphoprotein  <dig>  on wd after rat sciatic nerve injury.


RESULTS
spp <dig> was upregulated from 6 h to 14 days after sciatic nerve injury. altered expression of spp <dig> in schwann cells  resulted in altered mrna and protein expression levels for cytokines, c-fos, pkcα and phospho-erk/erk and affected sc apoptosis in vitro. silencing of spp <dig> expression in scs using sirna technology reduced proliferation and promoted migration of scs in vitro. by contrast, overexpression of spp <dig> promoted proliferation and reduced migration in scs in vitro. differential expression of spp <dig> after sciatic nerve injury in vivo altered the expression of cytokines, c-fos, pkcα, and the p-erk/erk pathway.


CONCLUSIONS
spp <dig> is a key regulatory factor that affects nerve degeneration and regeneration through c-fos, pkcα and p-erk/erk pathways after rat sciatic nerve injury. these results shed new light on the role of spp <dig> in nerve degeneration and regeneration during wd.
