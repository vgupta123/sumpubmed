BACKGROUND
elucidating the pattern of evolutionary changes in drug-metabolizing genes is an important subject not only for evolutionary but for biomedical research. we investigated the pattern of divergence and polymorphisms of macaque cyp1a <dig> and cyp1a <dig> genes, which are major drug-metabolizing genes in humans. in humans, cyp1a <dig> is specifically expressed in livers while cyp1a <dig> has a wider gene expression pattern in extrahepatic tissues. in contrast, macaque cyp1a <dig> is expressed at a much lower level than cyp1a <dig> in livers. interestingly, a previous study has shown that macaca fascicularis cyp1a <dig> harbored unusually high genetic diversity within species. genomic regions showing high genetic diversity within species is occasionally interpreted as a result of balancing selection, where natural selection maintains highly diverged alleles with different functions. nevertheless many other forces could create such signatures.


RESULTS
we found that the cyp1a1/ <dig> gene copy number and orientation has been highly conserved among mammalian genomes. the signature of gene conversion between cyp1a <dig> and cyp1a <dig> was detected, but the last gene conversion event in the simian primate lineage occurred before the catarrhini-platyrrhini divergence. the high genetic diversity of macaque cyp1a <dig> therefore cannot be explained by gene conversion between cyp1a <dig> and cyp1a <dig>  by surveying cyp1a <dig> polymorphisms in total  <dig> m. fascicularis and m. mulatta, we found several null alleles segregating in these species, indicating functional constraint on cyp1a <dig> in macaques may have weakened after the divergence between humans and macaques. we propose that the high genetic diversity in macaque cyp1a <dig> is partly due to the degeneration of cpg sites, which had been maintained at a high level by purifying selection, and the rapid degeneration process was initiated by the loss of functional constraint on macaque cyp1a <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our findings show that the highly polymorphic cyp1a <dig> gene in macaques has not been created by balancing selection but by the burst of cpg site degeneration after loss of functional constraint. because the functional importance of cyp1a1/ <dig> genes is different between humans and macaques, we have to be cautious in extrapolating a drug-testing data using substrates metabolized by cyp1a genes from macaques to humans, despite of their somewhat overlapping substrate specificity.
