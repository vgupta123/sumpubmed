BACKGROUND
the main vector for transmission of malaria in india is the anopheles culicifacies mosquito species, a naturally selected subgroup of which is completely refractory  to transmission of the malaria parasite, plasmodium vivax;


RESULTS
here, we report the molecular characterization of a serine protease -encoding gene from a. culicifacies, which was expressed in high abundance in the refractory strain compared to the susceptible  strain. the transcriptional upregulation of acsp <dig> upon plasmodium challenge in the refractory strain coincided with ookinete invasion of mosquito midgut. gene organization and primary sequence of acsp <dig> were identical in the r and s strains suggesting a divergent regulatory status of acsp <dig> in these strains. to examine this further, the upstream regulatory sequences of acsp <dig> were isolated, cloned and evaluated for the presence of promoter activity. the  <dig> bp upstream region of acsp <dig> from the two strains revealed sequence divergence. the promoter activity measured by luciferase-based reporter assay was shown to be  <dig> -fold higher in the r strain than in the s. gel shift experiments demonstrated a differential recruitment of nuclear proteins to upstream sequences of acsp <dig> as well as a difference in the composition of nuclear proteins in the two strains, both of which might contribute to the relative abundance of acsp <dig> in the r strain;


CONCLUSIONS
the specific upregulation of acsp <dig> in the r strain only in response to plasmodium infection is suggestive of its role in contributing the refractory phenotype to the a. culicifacies mosquito population.
