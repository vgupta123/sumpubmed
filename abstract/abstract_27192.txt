BACKGROUND
development of primary open-angle glaucoma  is associated with the malfunctioning trabecular meshwork . cell therapy offers great potential for the treatment of poag, but requires the generation of functional tm cells in vitro to replace the lost/dysfunctional cells. tm differentiation in vitro from various stem cell types must be monitored by the expression of specific markers. however, no single definitive marker of the tm has been identified.


RESULTS
to identify robust markers of tm differentiation, we performed global transcriptome profiling using high-density oligonucleotide microarray on ex vivo tm tissue and cultured tm progenitors. corneal and scleral tissues were also used in the analysis. after removal of genes expressed in the cornea and sclera,  <dig> genes were identified that were differentially expressed in the tm relative to the other samples. cdh <dig>  f <dig>  kcnab <dig>  fgf <dig>  spp <dig>  and hey <dig> were selected among the genes highly expressed in the tm, together with bdnf which was repressed, compared to progenitors for further investigation. expression analysis by qpcr verified the differential expression and immunofluorescence of the anterior segment confirmed strong expression in the tm.


CONCLUSIONS
three independent cohort of expression studies have identified novel markers, fitting in identifying tm cells and in evaluating directed tm differentiation in vitro.
