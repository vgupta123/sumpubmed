BACKGROUND
the transcription factor dof affecting germination <dig>  is a repressor of the light-mediated seed germination process. dag <dig> acts downstream phytochrome interacting factor3-like  <dig> , the master repressor, and negatively regulates gibberellin biosynthesis by directly repressing the biosynthetic gene atga3ox <dig>  the dof protein dof affecting germination  shares a high degree of aminoacidic identity with dag <dig>  while dag <dig> inactivation considerably increases the germination capability of seeds, the dag <dig> mutant has seeds with a germination potential substantially lower than the wild-type, indicating that these factors may play opposite roles in seed germination.


RESULTS
we show here that dag <dig> expression is positively regulated by environmental factors triggering germination, whereas its expression is repressed by pil <dig> and dag1; by chromatin immuno precipitation  analysis we prove that dag <dig> directly regulates dag <dig>  in addition, we show that red light significantly reduces germination of dag <dig> mutant seeds.


CONCLUSIONS
in agreement with the seed germination phenotype of the dag <dig> mutant previously published, the present data prove that dag <dig> is a positive regulator of the light-mediated seed germination process, and particularly reveal that this protein plays its main role downstream of pil <dig> and dag <dig> in the phytochrome b -mediated pathway.
