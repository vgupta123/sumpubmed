BACKGROUND
the purpose of this study was to characterize specific cytotoxic t-cell  responses in men who have sex with men  subjects infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  crf01_ae subtype during the first year of infection and impacts on viral control and evolution.


RESULTS
fifteen hiv- <dig> primary infected cases were recruited from liaoning msm prospective cohort. ctl responses to gag, pol and nef proteins at  <dig> month and  <dig> year post infection were detected with gamma interferon enzyme-linked immunospot  assay using optimized consensus overlapping peptides, as well as the viral quasispecies sequences from the synchronous plasma. gag and nef proteins were the main targets of ctl responses during the first year of hiv- <dig> infection, and this was evident from the data after adjusting for the length of amino acids by dividing the amino acids number of the corresponding protein and multiplying by  <dig>  additionally, relative magnitudes of gag at both  <dig> months and  <dig> year post infection were significantly negatively correlated with the viral set point . while the relative magnitude of nef at  <dig> year post infection were significantly positively correlated with viral set point . subjects with multi-layered gag immunodominant responses during the first year of infection had significantly lower viral set points than subjects without such responses .


CONCLUSIONS
multi-layered gag immunodominant responses during the first year of infection were correlated with viral control, which provides a theoretical basis for vaccine design targeting msm subjects with the crf01_ae subtype.
