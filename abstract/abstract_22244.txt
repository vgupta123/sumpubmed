BACKGROUND
organisms have evolved ways of regulating transcription to better adapt to varying environments. could the current functional genomics data and models support the possibility of engineering a genome with completely rearranged gene organization while the cell maintains its behavior under environmental challenges? how would we proceed to design a full nucleotide sequence for such genomes?


RESULTS
as a first step towards answering such questions, recent work showed that it is possible to design alternative transcriptomic models showing the same behavior under environmental variations than the wild-type model. a second step would require providing evidence that it is possible to provide a nucleotide sequence for a genome encoding such transcriptional model. we used computational design techniques to design a rewired global transcriptional regulation of escherichia coli, yet showing a similar transcriptomic response than the wild-type. afterwards, we “compiled” the transcriptional networks into nucleotide sequences to obtain the final genome sequence. our computational evolution procedure ensures that we can maintain the genotype-phenotype mapping during the rewiring of the regulatory network. we found that it is theoretically possible to reorganize e. coli genome into 86% fewer regulated operons. such refactored genomes are constituted by operons that contain sets of genes sharing around the 60% of their biological functions and, if evolved under highly variable environmental conditions, have regulatory networks, which turn out to respond more than 20% faster to multiple external perturbations.


CONCLUSIONS
this work provides the first algorithm for producing a genome sequence encoding a rewired transcriptional regulation with wild-type behavior under alternative environments.
