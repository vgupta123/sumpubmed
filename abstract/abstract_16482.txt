BACKGROUND
does a relationship exist between a protein's evolutionary rate and its number of interactions? this relationship has been put forward many times, based on a biological premise that a highly interacting protein will be more restricted in its sequence changes. however, to date several studies have voiced conflicting views on the presence or absence of such a relationship.


RESULTS
here we perform a large scale study over multiple data sets in order to demonstrate that the major reason for conflict between previous studies is the use of different but overlapping datasets. we show that lack of correlation, between evolutionary rate and number of interactions in a data set is related to the error rate. we also demonstrate that the correlation is not an artifact of the underlying distributions of evolutionary distance and interactions and is therefore likely to be biologically relevant. further to this, we consider the claim that the dependence is due to gene expression levels and find some supporting evidence. a strong and positive correlation between the number of interactions and the age of a protein is also observed and we show this relationship is independent of expression levels.


CONCLUSIONS
a correlation between number of interactions and evolutionary rate is observed but is dependent on the accuracy of the dataset being used. however it appears that the number of interactions a protein participates in depends more on the age of the protein than the rate at which it changes.
