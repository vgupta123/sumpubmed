BACKGROUND
typical analysis of time-series gene expression data such as clustering or graphical models cannot distinguish between early and later drug responsive gene targets in cancer cells. however, these genes would represent good candidate biomarkers.


RESULTS
we propose a new model - the dynamic time order network - to distinguish and connect early and later drug responsive gene targets. this network is constructed based on an integrated differential equation. spline regression is applied for an accurate modeling of the time variation of gene expressions. then a likelihood ratio test is implemented to infer the time order of any gene expression pair. one application of the model is the discovery of estrogen response biomarkers. for this purpose, we focused on genes whose responses are late when the breast cancer cells are treated with estradiol .


CONCLUSIONS
our approach has been validated by successfully finding time order relations between genes of the cell cycle system. more notably, we found late response genes potentially interesting as biomarkers of e <dig> treatment.
