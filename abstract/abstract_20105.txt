BACKGROUND
dental pulp stem cells  are increasingly being recognized as a viable cell source for regenerative medicine. although significant variations in their ex vivo expansion are well-established, dpsc proliferative heterogeneity remains poorly understood, despite such characteristics influencing their regenerative and therapeutic potential. this study assessed clonal human dpsc regenerative potential and the impact of cellular senescence on these responses, to better understand dpsc functional behaviour.


RESULTS
all dpscs were negative for htert. whilst one dpsc population reached > <dig> pds before senescence, other populations only achieved < <dig> pds, correlating with dpscs with high proliferative capacities possessing longer telomeres  than less proliferative populations . high proliferative capacity dpscs exhibited prolonged stem cell marker expression, but lacked cd <dig>  early-onset senescence, stem cell marker loss and positive cd <dig> expression in dpscs with low proliferative capacities were associated with impaired osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation, favouring adipogenesis. dpscs with high proliferative capacities only demonstrated impaired differentiation following prolonged expansion .


CONCLUSIONS
this study has identified that proliferative and regenerative heterogeneity is related to contrasting telomere lengths and cd <dig> expression between dpsc populations. these characteristics may ultimately be used to selectively screen and isolate high proliferative capacity/multi-potent dpscs for regenerative medicine exploitation.
