BACKGROUND
some species of water frogs originated from hybridization between different species. such hybrid populations have a particular reproduction system called hybridogenesis. in this paper we consider the two species pelophylax ridibundus and pelophylax lessonae, and their hybrids pelophylax esculentus. p. lessonae and p. esculentus form stable complexes  in which p. esculentus are hemiclonal. in l-e complexes all the transmitted genomes by p. esculentus carry deleterious mutations which are lethal in homozygosity.


RESULTS
we analyze, by means of an individual based computational model, l-e complexes. the results of simulations based on the model show that, by eliminating deleterious mutations, l-e complexes collapse. in addition, simulations show that particular female preferences can contribute to the diffusion of deleterious mutations among all p. esculentus frogs. finally, simulations show how l-e complexes react to the introduction of translocated p. ridibundus.


CONCLUSIONS
the conclusions are the following:  deleterious mutations  strongly contribute to the stability of l-e complexes;  female sexual choice can contribute to the diffusion of deleterious mutations; and  the introduction of p. ridibundus can destabilize l-e complexes.
