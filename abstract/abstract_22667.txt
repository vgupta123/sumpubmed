BACKGROUND
chow and liu showed that the maximum likelihood tree for multivariate discrete distributions may be found using a maximum weight spanning tree algorithm, for example kruskal's algorithm. the efficiency of the algorithm makes it tractable for high-dimensional problems.


RESULTS
we extend chow and liu's approach in two ways: first, to find the forest optimizing a penalized likelihood criterion, for example aic or bic, and second, to handle data with both discrete and gaussian variables. we apply the approach to three datasets: two from gene expression studies and the third from a genetics of gene expression study. the minimal bic forest supplements a conventional analysis of differential expression by providing a tentative network for the differentially expressed genes. in the genetics of gene expression context the method identifies a network approximating the joint distribution of the dna markers and the gene expression levels.


CONCLUSIONS
the approach is generally useful as a preliminary step towards understanding the overall dependence structure of high-dimensional discrete and/or continuous data. trees and forests are unrealistically simple models for biological systems, but can provide useful insights. uses include the following: identification of distinct connected components, which can be analysed separately ; identification of neighbourhoods for more detailed analyses; as initial models for search algorithms with a larger search space, for example decomposable models or bayesian networks; and identification of interesting features, such as hub nodes.
