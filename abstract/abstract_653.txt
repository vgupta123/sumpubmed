BACKGROUND
the austro-asiatic linguistic family, which is considered to be the oldest of all the families in india, has a substantial presence in southeast asia. however, the possibility of any genetic link among the linguistic sub-families of the indian austro-asiatics on the one hand and between the indian and the southeast asian austro-asiatics on the other has not been explored till now. therefore, to trace the origin and historic expansion of austro-asiatic groups of india, we analysed y-chromosome snp and str data of the  <dig> individuals from  <dig> indian populations, covering all the three branches of austro-asiatic tribes, viz. mundari, khasi-khmuic and mon-khmer, along with the previously published data on  <dig> relevant populations from asia and oceania.


RESULTS
our results suggest a strong paternal genetic link, not only among the subgroups of indian austro-asiatic populations but also with those of southeast asia. however, maternal link based on mtdna is not evident. the results also indicate that the haplogroup o-m <dig> had originated in the indian austro-asiatic populations ~ <dig>  yrs bp  and their ancestors carried it further to southeast asia via the northeast indian corridor. subsequently, in the process of expansion, the mon-khmer populations from southeast asia seem to have migrated and colonized andaman and nicobar islands at a much later point of time.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings are consistent with the linguistic evidence, which suggests that the linguistic ancestors of the austro-asiatic populations have originated in india and then migrated to southeast asia.
