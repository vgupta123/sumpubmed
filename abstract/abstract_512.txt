BACKGROUND
examining allelic variation of r-genes in closely related perennial species of arabidopsis thaliana is critical to understanding how population structure and ecology interact with selection to shape the evolution of innate immunity in plants. we finely sampled natural populations of arabidopsis lyrata from the great lakes region of north america  and broadly sampled six european countries  to investigate allelic variation of two r-genes  and neutral genetic markers  in relation to mating system, phylogeographic structure and subspecies divergence.


RESULTS
fine-scale sampling of populations revealed strong effects of mating system and population structure on patterns of polymorphism for both neutral loci and r-genes, with no strong evidence for selection. broad geographic sampling revealed evidence of balancing selection maintaining polymorphism in r-genes, with elevated heterozygosity and diversity compared to neutral expectations and sharing of alleles among diverged subspecies. codon-based tests detected both positive and purifying selection for both r-genes, as commonly found for animal immune genes.


CONCLUSIONS
our results highlight that combining fine and broad-scale sampling strategies can reveal the multiple factors influencing polymorphism and divergence at potentially adaptive genes such as r-genes.
