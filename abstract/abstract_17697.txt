BACKGROUND
predicting intrinsically disordered proteins is important in structural biology because they are thought to carry out various cellular functions even though they have no stable three-dimensional structure. we know the structures of far more ordered proteins than disordered proteins. the structural distribution of proteins in nature can therefore be inferred to differ from that of proteins whose structures have been determined experimentally. we know many more protein sequences than we do protein structures, and many of the known sequences can be expected to be those of disordered proteins. thus it would be efficient to use the information of structure-unknown proteins in order to avoid training data sparseness. we propose a novel method for predicting which proteins are mostly disordered by using spectral graph transducer and training with a huge amount of structure-unknown sequences as well as structure-known sequences.


RESULTS
when the proposed method was evaluated on data that included  <dig> disordered proteins and  <dig> ordered proteins, its sensitivity was  <dig>  and its specificity was  <dig> . it resulted in a matthews correlation coefficient  <dig>  points higher than that obtained using foldindex,  <dig>  points higher than that obtained using the method based on plotting hydrophobicity against the number of contacts and  <dig>  points higher than that obtained using support vector machines . to examine robustness against training data sparseness, we investigated the correlation between two results obtained when the method was trained on different datasets and tested on the same dataset. the correlation coefficient for the proposed method is  <dig>  higher than that for the method using svms. when the proposed sgt-based method was compared with four per-residue predictors ), its sensitivity was  <dig>  for disordered proteins, which is  <dig> – <dig>  higher than that of the per-residue predictors, and its specificity was  <dig>  for ordered proteins, which is  <dig> – <dig>  higher than that of the per-residue predictors. the proposed method was also evaluated on data that included  <dig> partially disordered proteins. it predicted the frequency of disordered proteins to be  <dig> % for the proteins with 5%–10% disordered sequences,  <dig> % for the proteins with 10%–20% disordered sequences and  <dig> % for proteins with 20%–40% disordered sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
the proposed method, which utilizes the information of structure-unknown data, predicts disordered proteins more accurately than other methods and is less affected by training data sparseness.
