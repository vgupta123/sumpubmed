BACKGROUND
the vestibular system controls the ion composition of its luminal fluid through several epithelial cell transport mechanisms under hormonal regulation. the semicircular canal duct  epithelium has been shown to secrete cl- under β2-adrenergic stimulation. in the current study, we sought to determine the ion transporters involved in cl- secretion and whether secretion is regulated by pka and glucocorticoids.


RESULTS
short circuit current  from rat sccd epithelia demonstrated stimulation by forskolin , 8-br-camp , 8-pcpt-camp , ibmx , and ro-20- <dig> . the pka activator n6-bnz-camp  also stimulated isc. partial inhibition of stimulated isc individually by bumetanide , and alkanoic acid  were additive and complete. stimulated isc was also partially inhibited by cftrinh- <dig> , flufenamic acid  and diphenylamine- <dig> ′-dicarboxylic acid . native canals of cftr+/− mice showed a stimulation of isc from isoproterenol and forskolin+ibmx but not in the presence of both bumetanide and dioa, while canals from cftr−/− mice had no responses. nonetheless, cftr−/− mice showed no difference from cftr+/− mice in their ability to balance . stimulated isc was greater after chronic incubation  with the glucocorticoids dexamethasone , prednisolone , hydrocortisone , and corticosterone  and mineralocorticoid aldosterone . steroid action was blocked by mifepristone but not by spironolactone, indicating all the steroids activated the glucocorticoid, but not mineralocorticoid, receptor. expression of transcripts for cftr; for kcc <dig>  kcc3a, kcc3b and kcc <dig>  but not kcc2; for nkcc <dig> but not nkcc <dig> and for wnk <dig> but only very low wnk <dig> was determined.


CONCLUSIONS
these results are consistent with a model of cl- secretion whereby cl- is taken up across the basolateral membrane by a na+-k+-2cl- cotransporter  and potentially another transporter, is secreted across the apical membrane via a cl- channel, likely cftr, and demonstrate the regulation of cl- secretion by protein kinase a and glucocorticoids.
