BACKGROUND
nasopharyngeal carcinoma  has a high metastatic feature. n,n′-dinitrosopiperazine  is involved in npc metastasis, but its mechanism is not clear. the aim of this study is to reveal the pathogenesis of dnp-involved metastasis. 6-10b cells with low metastasis are from npc cell line sune- <dig>  were used to investigate the mechanism of dnp-mediated npc metastasis.


RESULTS
6-10b cells were grown in dmem containing 2h4-l-lysine and 13c 6 15 n4-l-arginine or conventional l-lysine and l-arginine, and identified the incorporation of amino acid by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. labeled 6-10b cells were treated with dnp at  <dig> - <dig> μm to establish the non-cytotoxic concentration  range. ncc was  <dig> - <dig> μm. following treatment with dnp at this range, the motility and invasion of cells were detected in vitro, and dnp-mediated metastasis was confirmed in the nude mice. dnp increased 6-10b cell metastasis in vitro and vivo. dnp-induced protein expression was investigated using a quantitative proteomic. the silac-based approach quantified  <dig> proteins,  <dig> of which showed significant change after dnp treatment . dnp induced the change in abundance of mitochondrial proteins, mediated the status of oxidative stress and the imbalance of redox state, increased cytoskeletal protein, cathepsin, anterior gradient- <dig>  and clusterin expression. dnp also increased the expression of secretory akr1b <dig>  cathepsin b and clusterin 6-10b cells. gene ontology and ingenuity pathway analysis showed that dnp may regulate protein synthesis, cellular movement, lipid metabolism, molecular transport, cellular growth and proliferation signaling pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
dnp may regulate cytoskeletal protein, cathepsin, anterior gradient- <dig>  and clusterin expression, increase npc cells motility and invasion, is involved npc metastasis.
