BACKGROUND
signaling by the wnt family of secreted glycoproteins through their receptors, the frizzled  family of seven-pass transmembrane proteins, is critical for numerous cell fate and tissue polarity decisions during development.


RESULTS
we report a novel role of wnt signaling in organogenesis using the formation of the islet during pancreatic development as a model tissue. we used the advantages of the zebrafish to visualize and document this process in living embryos and demonstrated that insulin-positive cells actively migrate to form an islet. we used morpholinos , sequence-specific translational inhibitors, and time-lapse imaging analysis to show that the wnt- <dig> ligand and the fz- <dig> receptor are required for proper insulin-cell migration in zebrafish. histological analyses of islets in wnt5a-/- mouse embryos showed that wnt5a signaling is also critical for murine pancreatic insulin-cell migration.


CONCLUSIONS
our results implicate a conserved role of a wnt5/fz <dig> signaling pathway in islet formation during pancreatic development. this study opens the door for further investigation into a role of wnt signaling in vertebrate organ development and disease.
