BACKGROUND
glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. though a lot of research has been focused on this disease, the causes and pathogenesis of glioblastoma have not been indentified clearly.


RESULTS
we indentified  <dig>  significantly differentially expressed genes, and  <dig> pathways enriched in the set of differentially expressed genes among  <dig> tumor and  <dig> normal samples. we also indentified  <dig> differentially expressed micrornas among  <dig> tumor and  <dig> normal samples.  <dig> of which have been reported to affect glioblastoma and  <dig> of which were implicated in other cancers and brain diseases. we regressed gene expression on microrna expression in  <dig> tumor tissues and  <dig> normal tissues comprehensively. we found two experimentally validated microrna targets and  <dig>  mirna-target gene pairs in our datasets which were predicted by miranda algorithm,  <dig> of the target genes were tumor suppressor genes and  <dig> were oncogenes. further function analysis of target genes suggested that micrornas most frequently targeted genes associated with cell signalling and nervous system.


CONCLUSIONS
we investigated gene and microrna expression in glioblastoma and gave a comprehensive function study of differential expressed gene and microrna in glioblastoma patients. these findings gave important clues to study of the carcinogenic process in glioblastomas.
