BACKGROUND
the tgf-β transforming growth factor is the most pleiotropic cytokine controlling a broad range of cellular responses that include proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. the context-dependent multifunctional nature of tgf-β is associated with complex signaling pathways. differential models describe the dynamics of the tgf-β canonical pathway, but modeling the non-canonical networks constitutes a major challenge. here, we propose a qualitative approach to explore all tgf-β-dependent signaling pathways.


RESULTS
using a new formalism, cadbiom, which is based on guarded transitions and includes temporal parameters, we have built the first discrete model of tgf-β signaling networks by automatically integrating the  <dig> human signaling maps from the pathway interaction database into a single unified dynamic model. temporal property-checking analyses of  <dig> trajectories that regulate  <dig> tgf-β target genes reveal the association of specific pathways with distinct biological processes. we identify  <dig> different combinations of tgf-β with other extracellular stimuli involved in non-canonical tgf-β pathways that regulate specific gene networks. extensive analysis of gene expression data further demonstrates that genes sharing cadbiom trajectories tend to be co-regulated.


CONCLUSIONS
as applied here to tgf-β signaling, cadbiom allows, for the first time, a full integration of highly complex signaling pathways into dynamic models that permit to explore cell responses to complex microenvironment stimuli.
