BACKGROUND
monoclonal antibodies are a major class of biological therapies in human medicine but have not yet been successfully applied to veterinary species. we have developed a novel approach, petisation, to rapidly convert antibodies for use in veterinary species. as an example, anti-nerve growth factor  monoclonal antibodies  which are effective in reducing acute and chronic pain in rodents and man are potentially useful for treating pain in dogs but a fully caninised mab is required in order to avoid an immune response. the aim of this study was to determine the optimal properties of a caninised anti-ngf mab for safe, repeated administration to dogs, to determine its pharmacokinetic properties and to evaluate its efficacy in a model of inflammatory pain in vivo.


RESULTS
starting with a rat anti-ngf mab, we used a novel algorithm based on expressed canine immunoglobulin sequences to design and characterise recombinant caninised anti-ngf mabs. construction with only  <dig> of the  <dig> canine igg heavy chain isotypes  resulted in stable antibodies which bound and inhibited ngf with high-affinity and potency but did not bind complement c1q or the high-affinity fc receptor gamma r <dig> . one of the mabs  was selected for scale-up manufacture, purification and pre-clinical evaluation. when administered to dogs, nv- <dig> was well tolerated, had a long serum half-life of 9Â days, was not overtly immunogenic following repeated dosing in the dog and reduced signs of lameness in a kaolin model of inflammatory pain.


CONCLUSIONS
the combination of stability, high affinity and potency, no effector activity and long half-life, combined with safety and activity in the model of inflammatory pain in vivo suggests that further development of the caninised anti-ngf mab nv- <dig> as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of chronic pain in dogs is warranted.
