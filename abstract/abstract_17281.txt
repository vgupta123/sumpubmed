BACKGROUND
the bi-directional communication between the oocyte and its companion cumulus cells  is crucial for development and functions of both cell types. transcripts that are exclusively expressed either in oocytes or ccs and molecular mechanisms affected due to removal of the communication axis between the two cell types is not investigated at a larger scale. the main objectives of this study were:  <dig>  to identify transcripts exclusively expressed either in oocyte or ccs and  <dig>  to identify those which are differentially expressed when the oocyte is cultured with or without its companion ccs and vice versa.


RESULTS
we analyzed transcriptome profile of different oocyte and cc samples using affymetrix genechip bovine genome array containing  <dig> transcripts. out of  <dig> genes detected in germinal vesicle  oocytes and their companion ccs,  <dig> and  <dig> are exclusively expressed in oocytes and ccs, respectively, while  <dig> are expressed in both. similarly, of  <dig> genes detected in metaphase ii  oocytes and ccs,  <dig> and  <dig> are exclusively expressed in oocytes and ccs, respectively, while  <dig> are expressed in both. a total of  <dig> transcripts are differentially expressed between oocytes cultured with  and without  ccs, of which  <dig> and  <dig> are over expressed in the former and the later groups, respectively. similarly,  <dig> transcripts are differentially expressed when ccs mature with  or without  their enclosed oocytes. of these,  <dig> and  <dig> are over expressed in ccs + oo and ccs - oo, respectively.

while oocyte specific transcripts include those involved in transcription , translation  and ccs specific ones include those involved in carbohydrate metabolism , protein metabolic processes , steroid biosynthetic process . similarly, while transcripts over expressed in oo + ccs are involved in carbohydrate metabolism , molecular transport  and nucleic acid metabolism , those over expressed in ccs + oo are involved in cellular growth and proliferation , cell cycle , cellular development  and gene expression .


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study has generated large scale gene expression data from different oocyte and ccs samples that would provide insights into gene functions and interactions within and across different pathways that are involved in the maturation of bovine oocytes. moreover, the presence or absence of oocyte and cc factors during bovine oocyte maturation can have a profound effect on transcript abundance of each cell types, thereby showing the prevailing molecular cross-talk between oocytes and their corresponding ccs.
