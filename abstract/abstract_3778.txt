BACKGROUND
identification of transcription-factor binding motifs  can be formulated as a combinatorial problem, where an efficient algorithm is indispensable to predict the role of multiple binding motifs. an ant algorithm is a biology-inspired computational technique, through which a combinatorial problem is solved by mimicking the behavior of social insects such as ants. we developed a unique version of ant algorithms to select a set of binding motifs by considering a potential contribution of each of all random dna sequences of 4- to 7-bp in length.


RESULTS
human chondrogenesis was used as a model system. the results revealed that the ant algorithm was able to identify biologically known binding motifs in chondrogenesis such as ap- <dig>  nfÎºb, and sox <dig>  some of the predicted motifs were identical to those previously derived with the genetic algorithm. unlike the genetic algorithm, however, the ant algorithm was able to evaluate a contribution of individual binding motifs as a spectrum of distributed information and predict core consensus motifs from a wider dna pool.


CONCLUSIONS
the ant algorithm offers an efficient, reproducible procedure to predict a role of individual transcription-factor binding motifs using a unique definition of artificial ants.
