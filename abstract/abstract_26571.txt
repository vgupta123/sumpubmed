BACKGROUND
cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases form a large superfamily of enzymes that catalyze diverse reactions. the p450su <dig> gene from the soil bacteria streptomyces griseolus encodes cyp105a <dig> which acts on various substrates including sulfonylurea herbicides, vitamin d, coumarins, and based on the work presented here, brassinosteroids. p450su <dig> is used as a negative-selection marker in plants because cyp105a <dig> converts the relatively benign sulfonyl urea pro-herbicide r <dig> into a highly phytotoxic product. consistent with its use for negative selection, transgenic arabidopsis plants were generated with p450su <dig> situated between recognition sequences for flp recombinase from yeast to select for recombinase-mediated excision. however, unexpected and prominent developmental aberrations resembling those described for mutants defective in brassinosteroid signaling were observed in many of the lines.


RESULTS
the phenotypes of the most affected lines included severe stunting, leaf curling, darkened leaves characteristic of anthocyanin accumulation, delayed transition to flowering, low pollen and seed yields, and delayed senescence. phenotype severity correlated with p450su <dig> transcript abundance, but not with transcript abundance of other experimental genes, strongly implicating cyp105a <dig> as responsible for the defects. germination and seedling growth of transgenic and control lines in the presence and absence of 24-epibrassinolide indicated that cyp105a <dig> disrupts brassinosteroid signaling, most likely by inactivating brassinosteroids.


CONCLUSIONS
despite prior use of this gene as a genetic tool, deleterious growth in the absence of r <dig> has not been elaborated. we show that this gene can cause aberrant growth by disrupting brassinosteroid signaling and affecting homeostasis.
