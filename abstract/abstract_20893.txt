BACKGROUND
lichen is a classic mutualistic organism and the lichenization is one of the fungal symbioses. the lichen-forming fungus endocarpon pusillum is living in symbiosis with the green alga diplosphaera chodatii bialsuknia as a lichen in the arid regions.


RESULTS
 <dig> and illumina technologies were used to sequence the genome of e. pusillum. a total of  <dig>  genes were annotated in the  <dig> Â mb genome of e. pusillum. analyses of the genes provided direct molecular evidence for certain natural characteristics, such as homothallic reproduction and drought-tolerance. comparative genomics analysis indicated that the expansion and contraction of some protein families in the e. pusillum genome reflect the specific relationship with its photosynthetic partner . co-culture experiments using the lichen-forming fungus e. pusillum and its algal partner allowed the functional identification of genes involved in the nitrogen and carbon transfer between both symbionts, and three lectins without signal peptide domains were found to be essential for the symbiotic recognition in the lichen; interestingly, the ratio of the biomass of both lichen-forming fungus and its photosynthetic partner and their contact time were found to be important for the interaction between these two symbionts.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study lays a genomic analysis of the lichen-forming fungus e. pusillum for demonstrating its general biological features and the traits of the interaction between this fungus and its photosynthetic partner d. chodatii, and will provide research basis for investigating the nature of its drought resistance and symbiosis.
