BACKGROUND
cone degeneration is the hallmark of the inherited retinal disease retinitis pigmentosa. we have previously identified a trophic factor "rod-derived cone viability factor  that is secreted by rods and promote cone viability in a mouse model of the disease.


RESULTS
here we report the bioinformatic identification and the experimental analysis of rdcvf <dig>  a second trophic factor belonging to the rod-derived cone viability factor family. the mouse rdcvf gene is known to be bifunctional, encoding both a long thioredoxin-like isoform  and a short isoform with trophic cone photoreceptor viability activity . rdcvf <dig> shares many similarities with rdcvf in terms of gene structure, expression in a rod-dependent manner and protein 3d structure. furthermore, like rdcvf, the rdcvf <dig> short isoform exhibits cone rescue activity that is independent of its putative thiol-oxydoreductase activity.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these findings define a new family of bifunctional genes which are: expressed in vertebrate retina, encode trophic cone viability factors, and have major therapeutic potential for human retinal neurodegenerative diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa.
