BACKGROUND
despite recent algorithmic and conceptual progress, the stoichiometric network analysis of large metabolic models remains a computationally challenging problem.


RESULTS
sna is a interactive, high performance toolbox for analysing the possible steady state behaviour of metabolic networks by computing the generating and elementary vectors of their flux and conversions cones. it also supports analysing the steady states by linear programming. the toolbox is implemented mainly in mathematica and returns numerically exact results. it is available under an open source license from: .


CONCLUSIONS
thanks to its performance and modular design, sna is demonstrably useful in analysing genome scale metabolic networks. further, the integration into mathematica provides a very flexible environment for the subsequent analysis and interpretation of the results.
