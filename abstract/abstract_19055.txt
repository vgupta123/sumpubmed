BACKGROUND
estrogen receptor alpha <dig> , a variant of estrogen receptor alpha  is expressed in about half of breast tumors, independently of the / status. in vitro, eralpha <dig> triggers mitogenic non-genomic signaling and migration ability in response to 17beta-estradiol and tamoxifen. in vivo, highly eralpha <dig> expressing tumors are of poor outcome especially as  tumors are submitted to tamoxifen treatment which, in turn, enhances eralpha <dig> expression.


RESULTS
our study aimed to validate eralpha <dig> expression as a reliable prognostic factor for cancer progression from an estrogen dependent proliferative tumor toward an estrogen dispensable metastatic disease. in a retrospective study, we tried to decipher underlying mechanisms of cancer progression by using an original modeling of the relationships between eralpha <dig>  other estrogen and growth factor receptors and metastatic marker expression. nonlinear correlation analyses and mutual information computations led to characterize a complex network connecting eralpha <dig> to either non-genomic estrogen signaling or to metastatic process.


CONCLUSIONS
this study identifies eralpha <dig> expression level as a relevant classifier which should be taken into account for breast tumors clinical characterization and  tumor treatment orientation, using a generic approach for the rapid, cheap and relevant evaluation of any candidate gene expression as a predictor of a complex biological process.
