BACKGROUND
the origin of nuclear receptors  and the question whether the ancestral nr was a liganded or an unliganded transcription factor has been recently debated. to obtain insight into the evolution of the ligand binding ability of estrogen receptors , we comparatively characterized the er from the protochordate amphioxus , and the er from lamprey , a basal vertebrate.


RESULTS
extensive phylogenetic studies as well as signature analysis allowed us to confirm that the amphioxus er  and the lamprey er  belong to the er group. lamper behaves as a "classical" vertebrate er, as it binds to specific dna estrogen responsive elements , and is activated by estradiol , the classical er natural ligand. in contrast, we found that although amphier binds eres, it is unable to bind e <dig> and to activate transcription in response to e <dig>  among the  <dig> natural and synthetic er ligands tested as well as a large repertoire of  <dig> cholesterol derivatives, only bisphenol a  bound to amphier, suggesting that a ligand binding pocket exists within the receptor. parsimony analysis considering all available er sequences suggest that the ancestral er was not able to bind e <dig> and that this ability evolved specifically in the vertebrate lineage. this result does not support a previous analysis based on ancestral sequence reconstruction that proposed the ancestral steroid receptor to bind estradiol. we show that biased taxonomic sampling can alter the calculation of ancestral sequence and that the previous result might stem from a high proportion of vertebrate ers in the dataset used to compute the ancestral sequence.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our results highlight the importance of comparative experimental approaches vs ancestral reconstructions for the evolutionary study of endocrine systems: comparative analysis of extant ers suggests that the ancestral er did not bind estradiol and that it gained the ability to be regulated by estradiol specifically in the vertebrate lineage, before lamprey split.
