BACKGROUND
heterotrimeric g-proteins are important signalling switches, present in all eukaryotic kingdoms. in plants they regulate several developmental functions and play an important role in plant-microbe interactions. the current knowledge on plant g-proteins is mostly based on model angiosperms and little is known about the g-protein repertoire and function in other lineages. in this study we investigate the heterotrimeric g-protein subunit repertoire in pinaceae, including phylogenetic relationships, radiation and sequence diversity levels in relation to other plant linages. we also investigate functional diversification of the g-protein complex in picea abies by analysing transcriptional regulation of the g-protein subunits in different tissues and in response to pathogen infection.


RESULTS
a full repertoire of g-protein subunits in several conifer species were identified in silico. the full-length p. abies coding regions of one gα-, one gβ- and four gγ-subunits were cloned and sequenced. the phylogenetic analysis of the gγ-subunits showed that pagg <dig> clustered with a-type-like subunits, pagg <dig> and pagg <dig> clustered with c-type-like subunits, while pagg <dig> and its orthologs represented a novel conifer-specific putative gγ-subunit type. gene expression analyses by quantitative pcr of p. abies g-protein subunits showed specific up-regulation of the gα-subunit gene pagpa <dig> and the gγ-subunit gene pagg <dig> in response to heterobasidion annosum sensu lato infection.


CONCLUSIONS
conifers possess a full repertoire of g-protein subunits. the differential regulation of pagpa <dig> and pagg <dig> indicates that the heterotrimeric g-protein complex represents a critical linchpin in heterobasidion annosum s.l. perception and downstream signaling in p. abies.
