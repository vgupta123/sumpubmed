BACKGROUND
sars coronavirus main proteinase  is an important enzyme for the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus. the active site region of sars covmpro is divided into  <dig> subsites. understanding the binding mode of sars covmpro with a specific substrate is useful and contributes to structural-based drug design. the purpose of this research is to investigate the binding mode between the sars covmpro and two octapeptides, especially in the region of the s <dig> subsite, through a molecular docking and molecular dynamics  simulation approach.


RESULTS
the one turn α-helix chain  of the sars covmpro was directly involved in the induced-fit model of the enzyme-substrate complex. the s <dig> subsite of the enzyme had a negatively charged region due to the presence of glu <dig>  during md simulations, glu <dig> of the enzyme was shown to play a key role in electrostatic bonding with the p3lys of the octapeptide.


CONCLUSIONS
md simulations were carried out on the sars covmpro-octapeptide complex. the hypothesis proposed that glu <dig> of sars covmpro is an important residue in the s <dig> subsite and is involved in binding with p3lys of the octapeptide.
