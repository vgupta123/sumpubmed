BACKGROUND
the hetero-hexamer of the eukaryotic minichromosome maintenance  proteins plays an essential role in replication of genomic dna. the ring-shaped mcm2- <dig> hexamers comprising one of each subunit show helicase activity in vitro, and form double-hexamers on dna. the mcm4/6/ <dig> also forms a hexameric complex with helicase activity in vitro.


RESULTS
we used an escherichiai coli expression system to express various domains of schizosaccharomyces pombe mcm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in order to characterize their domain structure, oligomeric states, and possible inter-/intra-subunit interactions. we also successfully employed a co-expression system to express mcm4/6/ <dig> at the same time in escherichiai coli, and have purified functional mcm4/6/ <dig> complex in a hexameric state in high yield and purity, providing a means for generating large quantity of proteins for future structural and biochemical studies.


CONCLUSIONS
based on our results and those of others, models were proposed for the subunit arrangement and architecture of both the mcm4/6/ <dig> hexamer and the mcm2- <dig> double-hexamer.
