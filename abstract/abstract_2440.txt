BACKGROUND
as the evolution of mirna genes has been found to be one of the important factors in formation of the modern type of man, we performed a comparative analysis of the evolution of mirna genes in two archaic hominines, homo sapiens neanderthalensis and homo sapiens denisova, and elucidated the expression of their target mrnas in bain.


RESULTS
a comparative analysis of the genomes of primates, including species in the genus homo, identified a group of mirna genes having fixed substitutions with important implications for the evolution of homo sapiens neanderthalensis and homo sapiens denisova. the mrnas targeted by mirnas with mutations specific for homo sapiens denisova exhibited enhanced expression during postnatal brain development in modern humans. by contrast, the expression of mrnas targeted by mirnas bearing variations specific for homo sapiens neanderthalensis was shown to be enhanced in prenatal brain development.


CONCLUSIONS
our results highlight the importance of changes in mirna gene sequences in the course of homo sapiens denisova and homo sapiens neanderthalensis evolution. the genetic alterations of mirnas regulating the spatiotemporal expression of multiple genes in the prenatal and postnatal brain may contribute to the progressive evolution of brain function, which is consistent with the observations of fine technical and typological properties of tools and decorative items reported from archaeological denisovan sites. the data also suggest that differential spatial-temporal regulation of gene products promoted by the subspecies-specific mutations in the mirna genes might have occurred in the brains of homo sapiens denisova and homo sapiens neanderthalensis, potentially contributing to the cultural differences between these two archaic hominines.
