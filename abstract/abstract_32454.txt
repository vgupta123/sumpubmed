BACKGROUND
psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease in which t cells have a predominant role in initiating and perpetuating the chronic inflammation in skin. however, the mechanisms that regulate t cell activation in psoriasis are still incompletely understood. the objective of the present study was to characterize the main genetic pathways associated with t cell activation in psoriasis.


RESULTS
gene expression profiles from in vitro activated t cells were obtained from  <dig> psoriasis patients and  <dig> healthy controls using illumina ht- <dig> v <dig> microarrays. from a total of  <dig>  analyzed transcripts,  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed between psoriasis and controls . using an independent cohort of  <dig> patients and  <dig> healthy controls we validated the overexpression of spats2l  and klf <dig>  genes in activated t cells from psoriasis patients. using weighted correlation analysis we identified spats2l and klf <dig> coexpression networks, which were also significantly associated with psoriasis . gene ontology analysis allowed the identification of several biological processes associated with each coexpression network. finally, using gene set enrichment analysis over the global t cell transcriptome we also found additional genetic pathways strongly associated with psoriasis .


CONCLUSIONS
this study has identified two new genes, spats2l and klf <dig>  strongly associated with t cell activation in psoriasis. functional analyses of the gene expression profiles also revealed new biological processes and genetic pathways associated with psoriasis. the results of this study provide an important insight into the biology of this common chronic inflammatory disease.
