BACKGROUND
the presence of inverted repeats  in dna poses an obstacle to the normal progression of the dna replication machinery, because these sequences can form secondary structures ahead of the replication fork. a failure to process and to restart the stalled replication machinery can lead to the loss of genome integrity. consistently, irs have been found to be associated with a high level of genome rearrangements, including deletions, translocations, inversions, and a high rate of sister-chromatid exchange . the recq helicase sgs <dig>  in saccharomyces cerevisiae, is believed to act on stalled replication forks. to determine the role of sgs <dig> when the replication machinery stalls at the secondary structure, we measured the rates of ir-associated and non-ir-associated spontaneous unequal sce events in the sgs <dig> mutant, and in strains bearing mutations in genes that are functionally related to sgs <dig> 


RESULTS
the rate of sce in sgs <dig> cells for both ir and non-ir-containing substrates was higher than the rate in the wild-type background. the srs <dig> and mus <dig> mutations had modest effects, compared to sgs <dig>  the exo <dig> mutation increased sce rates for both substrates. the sgs <dig> exo <dig> double mutant exhibited synergistic effects on spontaneous sce. the ir-associated sce events in sgs <dig> cells were partially msh2-dependent.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that sgs <dig> suppresses spontaneous unequal sce, and sgs <dig> and exo <dig> regulate spontaneous sce by independent mechanisms. the mismatch repair proteins, in contradistinction to their roles in mutation avoidance, promote secondary structure-associated genetic instability.
