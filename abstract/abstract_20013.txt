BACKGROUND
the legumes  are an economically and ecologically important group of plant species with the conspicuous capacity for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in root nodules, specialized plant organs containing symbiotic microbes. with the aim of understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to nodulation, many efforts are underway to identify nodulation-related genes and determine how these genes interact with each other. in order to accurately and efficiently reconstruct nodulation gene network, a crowdsourcing platform, crowdnodnet, was created.


RESULTS
the platform implements the jquery and vis.js javascript libraries, so that users are able to interactively visualize and edit the gene network, and easily access the information about the network, e.g. gene lists, gene interactions and gene functional annotations. in addition, all the gene information is written on mediawiki pages, enabling users to edit and contribute to the network curation.


CONCLUSIONS
utilizing the continuously updated, collaboratively written, and community-reviewed wikipedia model, the platform could, in a short time, become a comprehensive knowledge base of nodulation-related pathways. the platform could also be used for other biological processes, and thus has great potential for integrating and advancing our understanding of the functional genomics and systems biology of any process for any species. the platform is available at http://crowd.bioops.info/, and the source code can be openly accessed at https://github.com/bioops/crowdnodnet under mit license.
