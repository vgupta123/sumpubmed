BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small rnas  providing an rna-based system of gene regulation highly conserved in plants and animals. in plants, mirnas control mrna degradation or restrain translation, affecting development and responses to stresses. plant mirnas show imperfect but extensive complementarity to mrna targets, making their computational prediction possible, useful when data mining is applied on different species. in this study we used a comparative approach to identify both mirnas and their targets, in artichoke and safflower.


RESULTS
two complete expressed sequence tags  datasets from artichoke  and safflower , were analysed with a bioinformatic pipeline and in vitro experiments, identifying  <dig> potential mirnas. for each est, using rnahybrid program and  <dig> non redundant mirna mature sequences, available in mirbase as reference, we searched matching putative targets.  <dig> out of  <dig> ests from safflower and  <dig> of  <dig> ests from artichoke showed at least one predicted mirna target. blast analysis showed that 75% of all ests shared at least a common homologous region  and about 50% of these displayed  <dig> bp or longer aligned sequences as conserved homologous/orthologous  regions.  <dig> and  <dig> ests of safflower and artichoke organized in cos shared  <dig> different mirna targets, considered functionally conserved, and statistically significant when compared with random sequences . four highly significant mirnas selected from in silico data were experimentally validated in globe artichoke leaves.


CONCLUSIONS
mature mirnas and targets were predicted within est sequences of safflower and artichoke. most of the mirna targets appeared highly/moderately conserved, highlighting an important and conserved function. in this study we introduce a stringent parameter for the comparative sequence analysis, represented by the identification of the same target in the cos region. after statistical analysis  <dig> targets, found on the cos regions and belonging to  <dig> mirna families, have a signal to noise ratio >  <dig>  with â‰¥  <dig>  specificity. the putative mirnas identified belong to  <dig> dicotyledon plants and to  <dig> families only in monocotyledon.
