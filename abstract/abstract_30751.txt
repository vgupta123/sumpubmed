BACKGROUND
this review comes after the international gap junction conference  and describes the current knowledge on the function of the specific motifs of connexins in the regulation of the formation of gap junction channels. moreover the review is complemented by a summarized description of the distinct contribution of gap junction channels in the electrical coupling.


RESULTS
complementary biochemical and functional characterization on cell models and primary cells have improved our understanding on the oligomerization of connexins and the formation and the electrical properties of gap junction channels. studies mostly focused cardiac connexins cx <dig> and cx <dig> expressed in myocytes, while cx <dig> and cx <dig>  have been less investigated, for which main findings are reviewed to highlight their critical contribution in the formation of gap junction channels for ensuring the orchestrated electrical impulse propagation and coordination of atrial and ventricular contraction and heart function, whereas connexin dysfunction and remodeling are pro-arrhythmic factors. common and specific motifs of residues identified in different domain of each type of connexin determine the connexin homo- and hetero-oligomerization and the channels formation, which leads to specific electrical properties.


CONCLUSIONS
these motifs and the resulting formation of gap junction channels are keys to ensure the tissue homeostasis and function in each connexin expression pattern in various tissues of multicellular organisms. altogether, the findings to date have significantly improved our understanding on the function of the different connexin expression patterns in healthy and diseased tissues, and promise further investigations on the contribution in the different types of connexin.
