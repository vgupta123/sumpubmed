BACKGROUND
leishmania meta <dig> has for long been a candidate molecule for involvement in virulence: meta <dig> transcript and protein are up-regulated in metacyclic leishmania. yet, how meta <dig> contributes to virulence remains unclear. we sought insights into the possible functions of meta <dig> by studying its evolutionary origins.


RESULTS
using multiple criteria including sequence similarity, nucleotide composition, phylogenetic analysis and selection pressure on gene sequence, we present evidence that meta <dig> originated in trypanosomatids as a result of a lateral gene transfer of a bacterial heat-inducible protein, hslj. furthermore, within the leishmania genome, meta <dig> sequence is under negative selection pressure against change/substitution. using homology modeling of leishmania meta <dig> based on solved nmr structure of hslj, we show that meta <dig> and hslj share a similar structural fold. the best hit for other proteins with similar fold is mxim, a protein involved in the type iii secretion system in shigella. the striking structural similarity shared by meta <dig>  hslj and mxim suggests a possibility of shared functions. upon structural superposition with mxim, we have observed a putative hydrophobic cavity in meta <dig>  mutagenesis of select hydrophobic residues in this cavity affects the secretion of the secreted acid phosphatase , indicating meta1's involvement in secretory processes in leishmania.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, this work uses an evolutionary biology approach, 3d-modeling and site-directed mutagenesis to arrive at new insights into functions of leishmania meta <dig>
