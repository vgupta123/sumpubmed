BACKGROUND
our approach to task 1a was inspired by tanabe and wilbur's abgene system  <cit> . like tanabe and wilbur, we approached the problem as one of part-of-speech tagging, adding a gene tag to the standard tag set. where their system uses the brill tagger, we used tnt, the trigrams 'n' tags hmm-based part-of-speech tagger  <cit> . based on careful error analysis, we implemented a set of post-processing rules to correct both false positives and false negatives. we participated in both the open and the closed divisions; for the open division, we made use of data from ncbi.


RESULTS
our base system without post-processing achieved a precision and recall of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, giving an f-measure of  <dig> %. the full system with post-processing achieved a precision and recall of  <dig> % and  <dig> % giving an f-measure of  <dig> %. we achieved a slight improvement  by employing a dictionary-based post-processing step for the open division. we placed third in both the open and the closed division.


CONCLUSIONS
our results show that a part-of-speech tagger can be augmented with post-processing rules resulting in an entity identification system that competes well with other approaches.
