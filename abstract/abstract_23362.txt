BACKGROUND
the regulatory mechanisms of motor protein-dependent intracellular transport are still not fully understood. the kinesin-1-binding protein, jip <dig>  can function as an adaptor protein that links kinesin- <dig> and other jip1-binding “cargo” proteins. however, it is unknown whether these “cargo” proteins influence the jip1–kinesin- <dig> binding.


RESULTS
we show here that jip1–kinesin- <dig> binding in neuro2a cells was dependent on conserved amino acid residues in the jip1-phosphotyrosine binding  domain, including f <dig>  in addition, mutation of f <dig> severely affected the neurite tip localization of jip <dig>  proteomic analysis revealed another kinesin- <dig> binding protein, jip <dig>  as a major jip <dig> binding protein. the association between jip <dig> and jip <dig> was dependent on the f <dig> residue in jip <dig>  and this association induced the formation of a stable ternary complex with kinesin- <dig>  on the other hand, the binding of jip <dig> and jip <dig> was independent of kinesin- <dig> binding. we also show that other ptb binding proteins can interrupt the formation of the ternary complex.


CONCLUSIONS
the formation of the jip1–kinesin- <dig> complex depends on the protein binding-status of the jip <dig> ptb domain. this may imply a regulatory mechanism of kinesin-1-dependent intracellular transport.
