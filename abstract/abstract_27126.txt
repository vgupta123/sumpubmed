BACKGROUND
adaptive divergence driven by environmental heterogeneity has long been a fascinating topic in ecology and evolutionary biology. the study of the genetic basis of adaptive divergence has, however, been greatly hampered by a lack of genomic information. the recent development of transcriptome sequencing provides an unprecedented opportunity to generate large amounts of genomic data for detailed investigations of the genetics of adaptive divergence in non-model organisms. herein, we used the illumina sequencing platform to sequence the transcriptome of brain and liver tissues from a single individual of the vinous-throated parrotbill, paradoxornis webbianus bulomachus, an ecologically important avian species in taiwan with a wide elevational range of sea level to  <dig> m.


RESULTS
our  <dig>  gbp of sequences were first assembled based on zebra finch  and chicken  rna references. the remaining reads were then de novo assembled. after filtering out contigs with low coverage , we retained  <dig>  of  <dig>  contigs, which covered approximately  <dig> % of the p. w. bulomachus genome. of  <dig>  contigs retained for a top-hit species distribution analysis, the majority  were matched to known zebra finch and chicken transcripts. we also annotated  <dig>  contigs to gene ontology  terms: in total,  <dig> go-slim terms were assigned, including biological process , molecular function , and cellular component . many potential genetic markers for future adaptive genomic studies were also identified:  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms,  <dig>  simple sequence repeats and  <dig> candidate genes that might be involved in elevational or climate adaptation.


CONCLUSIONS
our study shows that transcriptome data can serve as a rich genetic resource, even for a single run of short-read sequencing from a single individual of a non-model species. this is the first study providing transcriptomic information for species in the avian superfamily sylvioidea, which comprises more than  <dig>  species. our data can be used to study adaptive divergence in heterogeneous environments and investigate other important ecological and evolutionary questions in parrotbills from different populations and even in other species in the sylvioidea.
