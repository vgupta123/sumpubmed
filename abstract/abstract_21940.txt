BACKGROUND
genome analysis of three frankia sp. strains has revealed a high number of transposable elements in two of the strains. twelve out of the  <dig> major families of bacterial insertion sequence  elements are represented in the  <dig> annotated transposases of frankia strain hfpcci <dig>  comprising 3% of its total coding sequences . ean1pec  has  <dig> transposase orfs from  <dig> is families comprising  <dig> % of its cds. strain acn14a  differs significantly from the other strains with only  <dig> transposase orfs  from  <dig> is families.


RESULTS
insertion sequences in the frankia genomes were analyzed using blast searches, phyml phylogenies and the irf  algorithms. to identify putative or decaying is elements, a psi-tblastn search was performed on all three genomes, identifying 36%, 39% and 12% additional putative transposase orfs than originally annotated in strains cci <dig>  ean and acn, respectively. the distribution of transposase orfs in each strain was then analysed using a sliding window, revealing significant clustering of elements in regions of the ean and cci <dig> genomes. lastly the three genomes were aligned with the mauve multiple genome alignment tool, revealing several large chromosome rearrangement  events; many of which correlate to transposase clusters.


CONCLUSIONS
analysis of transposase orfs in frankia sp. revealed low inter-strain diversity of transposases, suggesting that the majority of transposase proliferation occurred without recent horizontal transfer of novel mobile elements from outside the genus. exceptions to this include representatives from the is <dig> family in strain ean and seven is <dig> transposases in all three strains that have a lower g+c content, suggesting recent horizontal transfer. the clustering of transposase orfs near lcrs revealed a tendency for is elements to be associated with regions of chromosome instability in the three strains. the results of this study suggest that is elements may help drive chromosome differences in different frankia sp. strains as they have adapted to a variety of hosts and environments.
