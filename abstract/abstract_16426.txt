BACKGROUND
the phylogenetic relationships among the holoparasites of rafflesiales have remained enigmatic for over a century. recent molecular phylogenetic studies using the mitochondrial matr gene placed rafflesia, rhizanthes and sapria  in the angiosperm order malpighiales and mitrastema  in ericales. these phylogenetic studies did not, however, sample two additional groups traditionally classified within rafflesiales . here we provide molecular phylogenetic evidence using dna sequence data from mitochondrial and nuclear genes for representatives of all genera in rafflesiales.


RESULTS
our analyses indicate that the phylogenetic affinities of the large-flowered clade and mitrastema, ascertained using mitochondrial matr, are congruent with results from nuclear ssu rdna when these data are analyzed using maximum likelihood and bayesian methods. the relationship of cytinaceae to malvales was recovered in all analyses. relationships between apodanthaceae and photosynthetic angiosperms varied depending upon the data partition: malvales , cucurbitales  or fabales . the latter incongruencies suggest that horizontal gene transfer  may be affecting the mitochondrial gene topologies. the lack of association between mitrastema and ericales using atp <dig> is suggestive of hgt, but greater sampling within eudicots is needed to test this hypothesis further.


CONCLUSIONS
rafflesiales are not monophyletic but composed of three or four independent lineages : rafflesiaceae, mitrastemonaceae, apodanthaceae and cytinaceae. long-branch attraction appears to be misleading parsimony analyses of nuclear small-subunit rdna data, but model-based methods  recover a topology that is congruent with the mitochondrial matr gene tree, thus providing compelling evidence for organismal relationships. horizontal gene transfer appears to be influencing only some taxa and some mitochondrial genes, thus indicating that the process is acting at the single gene  level.
