BACKGROUND
cysteine peptidases in the two-spotted spider mite tetranychus urticae are involved in essential physiological processes, including proteolytic digestion. cystatins and thyropins are inhibitors of cysteine peptidases that modulate their activity, although their function in this species has yet to be investigated. comparative genomic analyses are powerful tools to obtain advanced knowledge into the presence and evolution of both, peptidases and their inhibitors, and could aid to elucidate issues concerning the function of these proteins.


RESULTS
we have performed a genomic comparative analysis of cysteine peptidases and their inhibitors in t. urticae and representative species of different arthropod taxonomic groups. the results indicate: i) clade-specific proliferations are common to c1a papain-like peptidases and for the i25b cystatin family of inhibitors, whereas the c1a inhibitors thyropins are evolutionarily more conserved among arthropod clades; ii) an unprecedented extensive expansion for c <dig> legumain-like peptidases is found in t. urticae; iii) a sequence-structure analysis of the spider mite cystatins suggests that diversification may be related to an expansion of their inhibitory range; and iv) an in silico transcriptomic analysis shows that most cathepsin b and l cysteine peptidases, legumains and several members of the cystatin family are expressed at a higher rate in t. urticae feeding stages than in embryos.


CONCLUSIONS
comparative genomics has provided valuable insights on the spider mite cysteine peptidases and their inhibitors. mite-specific proliferations of c1a and c <dig> peptidase and i <dig> cystatin families and their over-expression in feeding stages of mites fit with a putative role in miteâ€™s feeding and could have a key role in its broad host feeding range.
