BACKGROUND
opioids are a mainstay for the treatment of chronic pain. unfortunately, therapy-limiting maladaptations such as loss of treatment effect , and paradoxical opioid-induced hyperalgesia  can occur. the objective of this study was to identify genes responsible for opioid tolerance and oih.


RESULTS
these studies used a well-established model of ascending morphine administration to induce tolerance, oih and other opioid maladaptations in  <dig> strains of inbred mice. genome-wide computational genetic mapping was then applied to the data in combination with a false discovery rate filter. transgenic mice, gene expression experiments and immunoprecipitation assays were used to confirm the functional roles of the most strongly linked gene. the behavioral data processed using computational genetic mapping and false discovery rate filtering provided several strongly linked biologically plausible gene associations. the strongest of these was the highly polymorphic mpdz gene coding for the post-synaptic scaffolding protein mpdz/mupp <dig>  heterozygous mpdz +/− mice displayed reduced opioid tolerance and oih. mpdz gene expression and mpdz/mupp <dig> protein levels were lower in the spinal cords of low-adapting 129s1/svlm mice than in high-adapting c57bl/ <dig> mice. morphine did not alter mpdz expression levels. in addition, association of mpdz/mupp <dig> with its known binding partner camkii did not differ between these high- and low-adapting strains.


CONCLUSIONS
the degrees of maladaptive changes in response to repeated administration of morphine vary greatly across inbred strains of mice. variants of the multiple pdz domain gene mpdz may contribute to the observed inter-strain variability in tolerance and oih by virtue of changes in the level of their expression.
