BACKGROUND
the problem of inferring the evolutionary history and constructing the phylogenetic tree with high performance has become one of the major problems in computational biology.


RESULTS
a new phylogenetic tree construction method from a given set of objects  is presented. as an extension of ant colony optimization, this method proposes an adaptive phylogenetic clustering algorithm based on a digraph to find a tree structure that defines the ancestral relationships among the given objects.


CONCLUSIONS
our phylogenetic tree construction method is tested to compare its results with that of the genetic algorithm . experimental results show that our algorithm converges much faster and also achieves higher quality than ga.
