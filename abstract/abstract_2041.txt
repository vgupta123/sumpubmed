BACKGROUND
pigeons and doves  are one of the oldest and most diverse extant lineages of birds. however, the nature and timing of the group’s evolutionary radiation remains poorly resolved, despite recent advances in dna sequencing and assembly and the growing database of pigeon mitochondrial genomes. one challenge has been to generate comparative data from the large number of extinct pigeon lineages, some of which are morphologically unique and therefore difficult to place in a phylogenetic context.


RESULTS
we used ancient dna and next generation sequencing approaches to assemble complete mitochondrial genomes for eleven pigeons, including the extinct ryukyu wood pigeon , the thick-billed ground dove , the spotted green pigeon , the rodrigues solitaire , and the dodo . we used a bayesian approach to infer the evolutionary relationships among  <dig> species of living and extinct pigeons and doves.


CONCLUSIONS
our analyses indicate that the earliest radiation of the columbidae crown group most likely occurred during the oligocene, with continued divergence of major clades into the miocene, suggesting that diversification within the columbidae occurred more recently than has been reported previously.
