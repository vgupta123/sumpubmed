BACKGROUND
bacillus thuringiensis belongs to the bacillus cereus sensu lato group of gram-positive and spore-forming bacteria. most isolates of b. thuringiensis can bear many endogenous plasmids, and the number and size of these plasmids can vary widely among strains or subspecies. as far as we know, the replicon of the plasmid pbmb <dig> is the first instance of a plasmid replicon being isolated from subsp. tenebrionis and characterized.


RESULTS
a  <dig> kb dna fragment containing a plasmid replicon was isolated from b. thuringiensis subsp. tenebrionis ybt- <dig> and characterized. by southern blot analysis, this replicon region was determined to be located on pbmb <dig>  the largest detected plasmid  of strain ybt- <dig>  deletion analysis revealed that a replication initiation protein , an origin of replication  and an iteron region were required for replication. in addition, two overlapping orfs  were found to be involved in stability control of plasmid. sequence comparison showed that the replicon of pbmb <dig> was homologous to the pamβ <dig> family replicons, indicating that the pbmb <dig> replicon belongs to this family. the presence of five transposable elements or remnants thereof in close proximity to and within the replicon control region led us to speculate that genetic exchange and recombination are potentially responsible for the divergence among the replicons of this plasmid family.


CONCLUSIONS
the replication and stability features of the pbmb <dig> from b. thuringiensis subsp. tenebrionis ybt- <dig> were identified. of particular interest is the homology and divergence shared between the pbmb <dig> replicon and other pamβ <dig> family replicons.
