BACKGROUND
protein acetylation is increasingly recognized as an important mechanism regulating a variety of cellular functions. several human protein acetyltransferases have been characterized, most of them catalyzing ε-acetylation of histones and transcription factors. we recently described the human protein acetyltransferase hard <dig> . hard <dig> interacts with nath  forming a complex expressing protein n-terminal α-acetylation activity.


RESULTS
we here describe a human protein, hard <dig>  with  <dig> % sequence identity to hard <dig>  the gene encoding hard <dig> most likely originates from a eutherian mammal specific retrotransposition event. hard <dig> mrna and protein are expressed in several human cell lines. immunoprecipitation experiments show that hard <dig> protein potentially interacts with nath, suggesting that hard2-nath complexes may be responsible for protein n-α-acetylation in human cells. in nb <dig> cells undergoing retinoic acid mediated differentiation, the level of endogenous hard <dig> and nath protein decreases while the level of hard <dig> protein is stable.


CONCLUSIONS
a human protein n-α-acetyltransferase is herein described. ard <dig> potentially complements the functions of ard <dig>  adding more flexibility and complexity to protein n-α-acetylation in human cells as compared to lower organisms which only have one ard.
