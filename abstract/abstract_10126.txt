BACKGROUND
initiation of the hair follicle placode and its subsequent growth, maturation and cycling in post-natal skin requires signaling interactions between epithelial cells and adjacent dermal cells and involves shh signaling via the primary cilium. previous reports have implicated laminins in hair follicle epithelial invagination.


RESULTS
here we use a human bcc model system and mouse mutants to re-evaluate the role of laminin- <dig> in epithelial invagination in the skin. blocking laminin  <dig> and  <dig> in bccs maintains primary cilia and shh signalling, but prevents invagination. similarly, in laminin- <dig> and dermal beta- <dig> integrin mutants, dermal papilla development and primary cilia formation are normal. dermal beta- <dig> integrin mutants have normal hair follicle development.


CONCLUSIONS
our data provides support for a primary role of laminin- <dig> promoting hair follicle epithelial downgrowth without affecting dermal primary cilia and shh target gene induction.
