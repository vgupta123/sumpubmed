BACKGROUND
ectodysplasin-a appears to be a critical component of branching morphogenesis. mutations in mouse eda or human eda are associated with absent or hypoplastic sweat glands, sebaceous glands, lacrimal glands, salivary glands , mammary glands and/or nipples, and mucous glands of the bronchial, esophageal and colonic mucosa. in this study, we utilized edata  mutant mice to investigate how a marked reduction in functional eda propagates with time through a defined genetic subcircuit and to test the proposition that canonical nfκb signaling is sufficient to account for the differential expression of developmentally regulated genes in the context of eda polymorphism.


RESULTS
the quantitative systems analyses do not support the stated hypothesis. for most nfκb-regulated genes, the observed time course of gene expression is nearly unchanged in tabby  as compared to wildtype mice, as is nfκb itself. importantly, a subset of genes is dramatically differentially expressed in tabby , strongly suggesting the existence of an alternative eda-mediated transcriptional pathway pivotal for smg ontogeny. experimental and in silico investigations have identified c/ebpα as a promising candidate.


CONCLUSIONS
in tabby smgs, upregulation of the egf/tgfα/egfr pathway appears to mitigate the potentially severe abnormal phenotype predicted by the downregulation of fgf <dig> and shh. others have suggested that the buffering of the phenotypic outcome that is coincident with variant eda signaling could be a common mechanism that permits viable and diverse phenotypes, normal and abnormal. our results support this proposition. further, if branching epithelia use variations of a canonical developmental program, our results are likely applicable to understanding the phenotypes of other branching organs affected by eda  mutation.
