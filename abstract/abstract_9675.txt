BACKGROUND
streptococcus parasanguinis is a primary colonizer of human tooth surfaces and plays an important role in dental plaque formation. bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation are mediated by long peritrichous fimbriae that are composed of a  <dig> kda serine rich glycoprotein named fap <dig> . glycosylation and biogenesis of fap <dig> are modulated by a gene cluster downstream of the fap <dig> locus. a gene encoding a glycosylation-associated protein, gap <dig>  was found to be important for fap <dig> glycosylation, long fimbrial formation and fap1-mediated biofilm formation.


RESULTS
deletion and site-directed mutagenesis were employed to dissect the regions within gap <dig> that were important for its function in fap <dig> glycosylation and biogenesis. a deletion of  <dig> consecutive amino acids, pdlpil, eliminated the production of the mature  <dig> kda fap <dig> protein and gave rise instead to a  <dig> kda fap <dig> intermediate that was only partially glycosylated. site-directed mutagenesis of the  <dig> amino acids revealed that only three of these amino acids were required. mutants in these amino acids  produced the premature  <dig> kda fap <dig> intermediate. mutants in the remaining amino acids produced the mature form of fap <dig>  cell surface expression of the fap <dig> precursor among l64r, p65r and l67t mutants was reduced to levels consistent with that of a gap <dig> insertional mutant. electron micrographs showed that these  <dig> mutants lost their long peritrichous fimbriae. furthermore, their in vitro adhesion ability to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite  was inhibited.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that  <dig> highly conserved, hydrophobic residues l <dig>  p <dig> and l <dig> in gap <dig> are essential for gap <dig> function and are important for complete glycosylation of fap <dig>  fimbrial formation and bacterial adhesion.
