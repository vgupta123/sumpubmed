BACKGROUND
tiling array data is hard to interpret due to noise. the wavelet transformation is a widely used technique in signal processing for elucidating the true signal from noisy data. consequently, we attempted to denoise representative tiling array datasets for chip-chip experiments using wavelets. in doing this, we used specific wavelet basis functions, coiflets, since their triangular shape closely resembles the expected profiles of true chip-chip peaks.


RESULTS
in our wavelet-transformed data, we observed that noise tends to be confined to small scales while the useful signal-of-interest spans multiple large scales. we were also able to show that wavelet coefficients due to non-specific cross-hybridization follow a log-normal distribution, and we used this fact in developing a thresholding procedure. in particular, wavelets allow one to set an unambiguous, absolute threshold, which has been hard to define in chip-chip experiments. one can set this threshold by requiring a similar confidence level at different length-scales of the transformed signal. we applied our algorithm to a number of representative chip-chip data sets, including those of pol ii and histone modifications, which have a diverse distribution of length-scales of biochemical activity, including some broad peaks.


CONCLUSIONS
finally, we benchmarked our method in comparison to other approaches for scoring chip-chip data using spike-ins on the encode nimblegen tiling array. this comparison demonstrated excellent performance, with wavelets getting the best overall score.
