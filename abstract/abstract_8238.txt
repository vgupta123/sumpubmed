BACKGROUND
lysyl-trna synthetase  is unique within the aminoacyl-trna synthetase family in that both class i  and class ii  enzymes exist. lysrs <dig> enzymes are found in archaebacteria and some eubacteria while all other organisms have lysrs <dig> enzymes. all sequenced strains of bacillus cereus  and bacillus thuringiensis however encode both a class i and a class ii lysrs. the lysk gene  of b. cereus strain  <dig> has an associated t box element, the first reported instance of potential t box control of lysrs expression.


RESULTS
a global study of  <dig> completely sequenced bacterial genomes identified t box elements associated with control of lysrs expression in only four bacterial species: b. cereus, b. thuringiensis, symbiobacterium thermophilum and clostridium beijerinckii. here we investigate the t box element found in the regulatory region of the lysk gene in b. cereus strain  <dig>  we show that this t box element is functional, responding in a canonical manner to an increased level of uncharged trnalys but, unusually, also responding to an increased level of uncharged trnaasn. we also show that b. subtilis strains with t box regulated expression of the endogenous lyss or the heterologous lysk genes are viable.


CONCLUSIONS
the t box element controlling lysk  expression in b. cereus strain  <dig> is functional, but unusually responds to depletion of charged trnalys and trnaasn. this may have the advantage of making lysrs <dig> expression responsive to a wider range of nutritional stresses. the viability of b. subtilis strains with a single lysrs <dig> or lysrs <dig>  whose expression is controlled by this t box element, makes the rarity of the occurrence of such control of lysrs expression puzzling.
