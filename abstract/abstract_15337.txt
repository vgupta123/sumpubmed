BACKGROUND
enterococci rank among the leading causes of nosocomial infections. the failure to identify pathogen-specific genes in enterococcus faecalis has led to a hypothesis where the virulence of different strains may be linked to strain-specific genes, and where the combined endeavor of the different gene-sets result in the ability to cause infection. population structure studies by multilocus sequence typing have defined distinct clonal complexes  of e. faecalis enriched in hospitalized patients .


RESULTS
in the present study, we have used a comparative genomic approach to investigate gene content in  <dig> e. faecalis strains, with a special focus on cc <dig>  statistical analysis using fisher's exact test revealed  <dig> significantly enriched genes among cc2-strains. the majority of these genes were located within the previously defined mobile elements phage <dig> , efab <dig>  and a vanb associated genomic island . moreover, a cc2-enriched genomic islet , encoding a putative phage related element within the v <dig> genome, was identified. from the draft genomes of cc2-strains hh <dig> and tx <dig>  we also identified a cc2-enriched non-v <dig> locus associated with the e. faecalis pathogenicity island . interestingly, surface related structures  implicated in virulence were significantly overrepresented  among the cc2-enriched genes.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have identified a set of genes with potential roles in adaptation or persistence in the hospital environment, and that might contribute to the ability of cc <dig> e. faecalis isolates to cause disease.
