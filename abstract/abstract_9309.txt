BACKGROUND
streptococcus mutans produces bacteriocins named mutacins. studies of mutacins have always been hampered by the difficulties in obtaining active liquid preparations of these substances. some of them were found to be lantibiotics, defined as bacterial ribosomally synthesised lanthionine-containing peptides with antimicrobial activity. the goal of this study was to produce and characterize a new mutacin from s. mutans strain 29b, as it shows a promising activity spectrum against current human pathogens.


RESULTS
mutacin h-29b, produced by s. mutans strain 29b, was purified by successive hydrophobic chromatography from a liquid preparation consisting of cheese whey permeate  supplemented with yeast extract  and caco <dig> . edman degradation revealed  <dig> amino acids identical to those of mutacin ii . the molecular mass of the purified peptide was evaluated at  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  da by maldi-tof ms.


CONCLUSIONS
a simple procedure for production and purification of mutacins along with its characterization is presented. our results show that the amino acid sequence of mutacin h-29b is identical to the already known mutacin ii  over the first  <dig> residues. s. mutans strains of widely different origins may thus produce very similar bacteriocins.
