BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis  colonizes the ovary and oviduct of chickens without causing overt clinical signs which can lead to se-contamination of the content and membrane of shell-eggs as well as hatchery eggs. the organism utilizes the salmonella pathogenicity island- <dig> encoded type iii secretion system  to promote persistence in the oviduct of laying hens. in this study, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  was carried out to determine the expression profiles of  <dig> known avian beta defensins  in primary chicken oviduct epithelial cells  before and after infections with a wild type se strain and t3ss mutant se strains carrying an inactivated sipa or pipb gene.


RESULTS
based on the expression levels in uninfected coec, avbds can be loosely grouped into three categories with avbd4- <dig> and avbd9- <dig> being constitutively expressed at high levels; avbd <dig>  avbd <dig>  and avbd13- <dig> at moderate levels; and avbd <dig> and avbd6- <dig> at minimal levels. infection with the wild type se strain temporarily repressed certain highly expressed avbds and induced the expression of minimally expressed avbds. the pipb mutant, compared to the wild type strain, had reduced suppressive effect on the expression of highly expressed avbds. moreover, the pipb mutant elicited significantly higher levels of the minimally expressed avbds than the wild type se or the sipa mutant did.


CONCLUSIONS
chicken oviduct epithelial cells express most of the known avbd genes in response to se infection. pipb, a t3ss- <dig> effector protein, plays a role in dampening the Î²-defensin arm of innate immunity during se invasion of chicken oviduct epithelium.
