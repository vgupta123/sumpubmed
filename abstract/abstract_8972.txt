BACKGROUND
since  <dig>  several studies have reported high rifampicin resistance rates  among methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  isolates from south africa. the authors previously characterised  <dig> mrsa isolates from hospitals in cape town, south africa; forty-five percent of these isolates were rifampicin-resistant. the majority  corresponded to st612-mrsa-iv, which is prevalent in south africa, but has not been reported frequently elsewhere. the remaining rifampicin-resistant isolate corresponded to st5-mrsa-i. the aim of this study was to investigate further the prevalence and genetic basis of rifampicin-resistance in mrsa isolates from hospitals in cape town.


RESULTS
between july  <dig> and june  <dig>  the prevalence of rifampicin-resistant mrsa in hospitals in cape town ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. based on the results of the aforementioned study, nine st612-mrsa-iv isolates, the rifampicin-resistant st5-mrsa-i isolate, and two rifampicin-susceptible mrsa isolates were investigated. four previously described st612-mrsa-iv isolates, including two each from south africa and australia, were also included.

the st5-mrsa-i isolate carried a single mutational change, h481y, commonly associated with high-level rifampicin resistance. all st612-mrsa-iv isolates carried an uncommon double amino acid substitution in rpob, h481n, i527m, whilst one of the australian st612-mrsa-iv isolates carried an additional mutation within rpob, representing a novel rpob genotype: h481n, i527m, k579r. all st612-mrsa-iv isolates also shared a unique silent single nucleotide polymorphism  within rpob.


CONCLUSIONS
that local st612-mrsa-iv isolates described here share an uncommon rpob genotype and a unique silent snp suggests this clone may have undergone clonal expansion in hospitals in cape town. further, the data suggest that these isolates may be related to rifampicin-resistant st612-mrsa-iv previously described in south africa and australia.
