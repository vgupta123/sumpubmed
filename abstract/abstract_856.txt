BACKGROUND
par <dig>  a member of the parvulin family of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases that is involved in rrna processing, microtubule formation and the glucose metabolism and has been suggested to play a role in chromatin remodeling on basis of sequence and structural identities to hmg proteins. par <dig> is enriched in the nucleus and binds to double-stranded dna in vitro.


RESULTS
by means of sub-nuclear biochemical fractionations, we demonstrate that cellular par <dig> is associated with chromatin 3-fold higher than with the nuclear matrix in vivo. par <dig> is released from the chromatin fraction after treatment with dnase i and elutes at high nacl concentrations from the nucleic acid-binding fraction. using qrt-pcr and western blotting we demonstrate that par <dig> is up-regulated during the s and g2/m phases in synchronised human foreskin fibroblasts cells.


CONCLUSIONS
in the light of our results, par <dig> can be described as an endogenous non-histone chromatin protein, which binds dna in vivo. we propose that par <dig> is involved in a dna-dependent activity such as transcription.
