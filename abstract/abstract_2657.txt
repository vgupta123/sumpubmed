BACKGROUND
the use of metagenomics in enzyme discovery constitutes a powerful approach to access to genomes of unculturable community of microorganisms and isolate novel valuable biocatalysts for use in a wide range of biotechnological and pharmaceutical fields.


RESULTS
here we present a novel esterase gene  identified by functional screening of three fosmid metagenomic libraries, constructed from three marine sediment samples. the sequenced positive fosmid revealed an enzyme of  <dig> amino acids with similarity to class  <dig> lipases. the 3d modeling of lip <dig> was generated by homology modeling on the basis of four lipases templates  to unravel structural features of this novel enzyme. the catalytic triad of lip <dig> was predicted to be asp <dig>  his <dig> and the catalytic nucleophile ser <dig> in a conserved pentapeptide . the 3d model highlighted the presence of a one-helix lid able to regulate the access of the substrate to the active site when the enzyme binds a hydrophobic interface. moreover an analysis of the external surface of lip <dig> model showed that the majority of the surface regions were hydrophobic  compared with homologous lipases  used as templates. the recombinant lip <dig> esterase, expressed and purified from escherichia coli, preferentially hydrolyzed short and medium length p-nitrophenyl esters with the best substrate being p-nitrophenyl acetate. further characterization revealed a temperature optimum of 35 °c and a ph optimum of  <dig> . lip <dig> exhibits a broad temperature stability range and tolerates the presence of dtt, edta, pmsf, β-mercaptoethanol and high concentrations of salt. the enzyme was also highly activated by nacl.


CONCLUSIONS
the biochemical characterization and homology model reveals a novel esterase originating from the marine arctic metagenomics libraries with features of a cold-active, relatively thermostable and highly halotolerant enzyme. taken together, these results suggest that this esterase could be a highly valuable candidate for biotechnological applications such as organic synthesis reactions and cheese ripening processes.
