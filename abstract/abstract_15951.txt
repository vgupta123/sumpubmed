BACKGROUND
staphyloccocal nuclease domain-containing protein  <dig>  is involved in the regulation of gene expression and rna protection. while numerous studies have established that snd <dig> protein expression is modulated by cellular stresses associated with tumor growth, hypoxia, inflammation, heat-shock and oxidative conditions, little is known about the factors responsible for snd <dig> expression. here, we have approached this question by analyzing the transcriptional response of human snd <dig> gene to pharmacological endoplasmic reticulum  stress in liver cancer cells.


RESULTS
we provide first evidence that snd <dig> promoter activity is increased in human liver cancer cells upon exposure to thapsigargin or tunicamycin or by ectopic expression of atf <dig>  a crucial transcription factor in the unfolded protein response triggered by er stress. deletion analysis of the 5’-flanking region of snd <dig> promoter identified maximal activation in fragment , which contains most of the predicted er stress response elements in proximal promoter. quantitative real-time pcr revealed a near  <dig> fold increase in snd <dig> mrna expression by either of the stress-inducers; whereas snd <dig> protein was maximally upregulated  in cells exposed to tunicamycin, a protein glycosylation inhibitor.


CONCLUSIONS
promoter activity of the cell growth- and rna-protection associated snd <dig> gene is up-regulated by er stress in human hepatoma cells.
