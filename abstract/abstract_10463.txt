BACKGROUND
comparative analysis of genome-wide expression profiles are increasingly being used to study virus-specific host interactions. in order to gain mechanistic insights, gene expression profiles can be combined with information on dna-binding sites of transcription factors to detect transcription factor activity  during viral infections. here, we apply this approach to study mechanisms of immune antagonism elicited by influenza a virus  by comparing the transcriptional response with the non-pathogenic newcastle disease virus , which lacks human immune antagonism.


RESULTS
existing gene set approaches do not quantify activity in a way that can be statistically compared between responses. we thus developed a new method for bayesian estimation of transcription factor activity  that allows for such quantification and comparative analysis across multiple responses. beta predicted decreased isgf <dig> activity during influenza a infection of human dendritic cells . this prediction was confirmed through a combination of mathematical modeling and experiments at different multiplicities of infection to show that isgs were specifically blocked in infected cells. suppression of the transcription factor satb <dig> was also predicted as a novel effect of influenza-mediated immune antagonism, and validated experimentally.


CONCLUSIONS
comparative analysis of genome-wide transcriptional profiles can reveal new effects of viral immune antagonism. we have developed a computational framework  that enables quantitative comparative analysis of transcription factor activities. this method will aid future studies to identify mechanistic differences in the host-pathogen interactions. application of beta to genome-wide transcriptional profiling data from human dcs identified satb <dig> as a novel effect of influenza antagonism.
