BACKGROUND
thermostable enzymes from thermophiles have attracted extensive studies. in this investigation, a nuclease-encoding gene  was obtained from a thermophilic bacteriophage gbsv <dig> for the first time.


RESULTS
after recombinant expression in escherichia coli, the purified gbsv1-nsn exhibited non-specific nuclease activity, being able to degrade various nucleic acids, including rna, single-stranded dna and double-stranded dna that was circular or linear. based on sequence analysis, the nuclease shared no homology with any known nucleases, suggesting that it was a novel nuclease. the characterization of the recombinant gbsv1-nsn showed that its optimal temperature and ph were 60°c and  <dig> , respectively. the results indicated that the enzymatic activity was inhibited by enzyme inhibitors or detergents, such as ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, citrate, dithiothreitol, β-mercaptoethanol, guanidine hydrochloride, urea and sds. in contrast, the nuclease activity was enhanced by tritonx- <dig>  tween- <dig> or chaps to approximately  <dig> % –  <dig> %. the km of gbsv1-nsn nuclease was  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm, while its kcat was  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> s- <dig> for the cleavage of dsdna, ssdna and rna, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
our study, therefore, presented a novel thermostable non-specific nuclease from thermophilic bacteriophage and its overexpression and purification for scientific research and applications.
