BACKGROUND
knowledge of the consequences of heterozygous mutations of developmentally important genes is important for understanding human genetic disorders. the gli <dig> gene encodes a zinc finger transcription factor and homozygous loss-of-function mutations of gli <dig> are lethal. humans heterozygous for mutations in this gene suffer greig cephalopolysyndactyly or pallister-hall syndromes, in which limb defects are prominent, and mice heterozygous for similar mutations have extra digits. here we examined whether eye development, which is abnormal in mice lacking functional gli <dig>  is defective in gli3+/- mice.


RESULTS
we showed that gli <dig> is expressed in the developing eye but that gli3+/- mice have only very subtle eye defects. we then generated mice compound heterozygous for mutations in both gli <dig> and pax <dig>  which encodes another developmentally important transcription factor known to be crucial for eye development. pax6+/-; gli3+/- eyes were compared to the eyes of wild-type, pax6+/- or gli3+/- siblings. they exhibited a range of abnormalities of the retina, iris, lens and cornea that was more extensive than in single gli3+/- or pax6+/- mutants or than would be predicted by addition of their phenotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings indicate that heterozygous mutations of gli <dig> can impact on eye development. the importance of a normal gli <dig> gene dosage becomes greater in the absence of a normal pax <dig> gene dosage, suggesting that the two genes co-operate during eye morphogenesis.
