BACKGROUND
the presence of prophages has been an important variable in genetic exchange and divergence in most bacteria. this study reports the determination of the genomic sequence of salmonella phage ε <dig>  a temperate bacteriophage that was important in the early study of prophages that modify their hosts' cell surface and is of a type  that is common in salmonella genomes.


RESULTS
the sequence shows that ε <dig> is a mosaically related member of the p <dig> branch of the lambdoid phages. its sequence is compared with the known p22-like phages and several related but previously unanalyzed prophage sequences in reported bacterial genome sequences.


CONCLUSIONS
these comparisons indicate that there has been little if any genetic exchange within the procapsid assembly gene cluster with p22-like e. coli/shigella phages that are have orthologous but divergent genes in this region. presumably this observation reflects the fact that virion assembly proteins interact intimately and divergent proteins can no longer interact. on the other hand, non-assembly genes in the "ant moron" appear to be in a state of rapid flux, and regulatory genes outside the assembly gene cluster have clearly enjoyed numerous and recent horizontal exchanges with phages outside the p22-like group. the present analysis also shows that ε <dig> harbors a gtrabc gene cluster which should encode the enzymatic machinery to chemically modify the host o antigen polysaccharide, thus explaining its ability to alter its host's serotype. a comprehensive comparative analysis of the known phage gtrabc gene clusters shows that they are highly mobile, having been exchanged even between phage types, and that most "bacterial" gtrabc genes lie in prophages that vary from being largely intact to highly degraded. clearly, temperate phages are very major contributors to the o-antigen serotype of their salmonella hosts.
