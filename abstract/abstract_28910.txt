BACKGROUND
in recent years, several types of molecular markers and new microscale skeletal characters have shown potential as powerful tools for phylogenetic reconstructions and higher-level taxonomy of scleractinian corals. nonetheless, discrimination of closely related taxa is still highly controversial in scleractinian coral research. here we used newly sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes and  <dig> microsatellites to define the genetic divergence between two closely related azooxanthellate taxa of the family caryophylliidae: solitary desmophyllum dianthus and colonial lophelia pertusa.


RESULTS
in the mitochondrial control region, an astonishing  <dig>  % of nucleotides between l. pertusa and d. dianthus were identical. variability of the mitochondrial genomes of the two species is represented by only  <dig> non-synonymous out of  <dig> total nucleotide substitutions. microsatellite sequence  analysis of l. pertusa and d. dianthus showed genetic similarity is about 97 %. our results also indicated that l. pertusa and d. dianthus show high skeletal plasticity in corallum shape and similarity in skeletal ontogeny, micromorphological  and microstructural characters .


CONCLUSIONS
molecularly and morphologically, the solitary desmophyllum and the dendroid lophelia appear to be significantly more similar to each other than other unambiguous coral genera analysed to date. this consequently leads to ascribe both taxa under the generic name desmophyllum . findings of this study demonstrate that coloniality may not be a robust taxonomic character in scleractinian corals.
