BACKGROUND
synthetic lethality experiments identify pairs of genes with complementary function. more direct functional associations  may be inferred between genes that share synthetic lethal interaction partners than genes that are directly synthetic lethal. probabilistic algorithms that identify gene modules based on motif discovery are highly appropriate for the analysis of synthetic lethal genetic interaction data and have great potential in integrative analysis of heterogeneous datasets.


RESULTS
we have developed genetic interaction motif finding , an algorithm for unsupervised motif discovery from synthetic lethal interaction data. interaction motifs are characterized by position weight matrices and optimized through expectation maximization. given a seed gene, gimf performs a nonlinear transform on the input genetic interaction data and automatically assigns genes to the motif or non-motif category. we demonstrate the capacity to extract known and novel pathways for saccharomyces cerevisiae . annotations suggested for several uncharacterized genes are supported by recent experimental evidence. gimf is efficient in computation, requires no training and automatically down-weights promiscuous genes with high degrees.


CONCLUSIONS
gimf effectively identifies pathways from synthetic lethality data with several unique features. it is mostly suitable for building gene modules around seed genes. optimal choice of one single model parameter allows construction of gene networks with different levels of confidence. the impact of hub genes the generic probabilistic framework of gimf may be used to group other types of biological entities such as proteins based on stochastic motifs. analysis of the strongest motifs discovered by the algorithm indicates that synthetic lethal interactions are depleted between genes within a motif, suggesting that synthetic lethality occurs between-pathway rather than within-pathway.
