BACKGROUND
egg quality is an important aspect in rainbow trout farming. post-ovulatory aging is one of the most important factors affecting egg quality. micrornas  are the major regulators in various biological processes and their expression profiles could serve as reliable biomarkers for various pathological and physiological conditions. the objective of this study was to identify mirnas that are associated with egg qualities in rainbow trout using post-ovulatory aged eggs.


RESULTS
egg samples from females on day  <dig>  day  <dig>  and day  <dig> post-ovulation , which had the fertilization rates of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and less than 50%, respectively, were collected and small rnas isolated from these samples were subjected to deep sequencing using the illumina platform. the massive sequencing produced  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads from the libraries of d1po, d7po and d14po eggs, respectively. a three-way comparison of the mirnas indicated that the egg samples shared  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas, and a total of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> known and  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified from d1po, d7po and d14po eggs, respectively. four known mirnas  and two novel mirnas  showed significantly higher expression in d1po eggs relative to d14po eggs as revealed by both deep sequencing and real time quantitative pcr analysis. go analysis of the predicted target genes of these differentially expressed mirnas revealed significantly enriched go terms that are related to stress response, cell death, dna damage, atp generation, signal transduction and transcription regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
results indicate that post-ovulatory ageing affects mirna expression profiles in rainbow trout eggs, which can in turn impact egg quality. further characterization of the differentially expressed mirnas and their target genes may provide valuable information on the role of these mirnas in controlling egg quality, and ultimately lead to the development of biomarkers for prediction of egg quality in rainbow trout.
