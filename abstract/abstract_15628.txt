BACKGROUND
in post-genomic era, the study of transcriptional regulation is pivotal to decode genetic information. transcription factors  are central proteins for transcriptional regulation, and interactions between tfs and their dna targets  are important for downstream genesâ€™ expression. however, the lack of knowledge about interactions between tfs and tfbss is still baffling people to investigate the mechanism of transcription.


RESULTS
to expand the knowledge about interactions between tfs and tfbss, three biological features  were utilized to build tfbs identification models for studying binding preference between tfs and their dna targets in mammals. results show that each feature does have fairly well performance to capture tfbss, and the hybrid model combined all three features is more robust for tfbs identification. subsequently, correspondence between tfs and their tfbss was investigated to explore interactions among them in mammals. results indicate that tfs and tfbss are reciprocal in sequence, structure, and evolution level.


CONCLUSIONS
our work demonstrates that, to some extent, tfs and tfbss have developed a coevolutionary relationship in order to keep their physical binding and maintain their regulatory functions. in summary, our work will help understand transcriptional regulation and interpret binding mechanism between proteins and dnas.
