BACKGROUND
global control influences the regulation of many individual subsystems by superimposed regulator proteins. a prominent example is the control of carbohydrate uptake systems by the transcription factor crp in escherichia coli. a detailed understanding of the coordination of the control of individual transporters offers possibilities to explore the potential of microorganisms e.g. in biotechnology.


RESULTS
an o.d.e. based mathematical model is presented that maps a physiological parameter – the specific growth rate – to the sensor of the signal transduction unit, here a component of the bacterial phosphotransferase system , namely eiiacrr. the model describes the relation between the growth rate and the degree of phosphorylation of eiia crr for a number of carbohydrates by a distinctive response curve, that differentiates between pts transported carbohydrates and non-pts carbohydrates. with only a small number of kinetic parameters, the model is able to describe a broad range of experimental steady-state and dynamical conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
the steady-state characteristic presented shows a relationship between the growth rate and the output of the sensor system pts. the glycolytic flux that is measured by this sensor is a good indicator to represent the nutritional status of the cell.
