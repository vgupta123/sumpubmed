BACKGROUND
high purity of tumour samples is a necessity for accurate genetic and expression analysis and is usually achieved by positive selection in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia .


RESULTS
we adapted a bifunctional rosette-based antibody cocktail for negative selection of b-cells for isolating cll cells from peripheral blood . pb samples from cll patients were split into aliquots. one aliquot of each sample was enriched by density gradient centrifugation , while the other aliquot of each sample was incubated with an antibody cocktail for b-cell enrichment prior to dgc . the purity of cll cells after dgc averaged  <dig> % . using rs+dgc, the purity averaged  <dig> %  with  <dig> of  <dig>  samples showing cll purities above 90%. rna extracted from enriched cll cells was of appropriately high quality for microarray analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
this study confirms the use of a bifunctional rosette-based antibody cocktail as an effective method for the purification of cll cells from peripheral blood.
