BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile is the main cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea and colitis known as c. difficile-associated disease .with increased severity and failure of treatment in cdad, new approaches for prevention and treatment, such as the use of probiotics, are needed. since the pathogenesis of cdad involves an inflammatory response with a massive influx of neutrophils recruited by interleukin - <dig>  this study aimed to investigate the probiotic effects of lactobacillus spp. on the suppression of il- <dig> production in response to c. difficile infection.


RESULTS
we screened lactobacillus conditioned media from  <dig> infant fecal isolates for the ability to suppress c. difficile-induced il- <dig> production from ht- <dig> cells. factors produced by two vancomycin-resistant lactobacilli, l. rhamnosus l <dig>  and l.casei l <dig> , suppressed the secretion and transcription of il- <dig> without inhibiting c. difficile viability or toxin production. conditioned media from lr-l <dig> suppressed the activation of phospho-nf-κb with no effect on phospho-c-jun. however, lc-l <dig> conditioned media suppressed the activation of both phospho-nf-κb and phospho-c-jun. conditioned media from lr-l <dig> and lc-l <dig> also decreased the production of c. difficile-induced gm-csf in ht- <dig> cells. immunomodulatory factors present in the conditioned media of both lr-l <dig> and lc-l <dig> are heat-stable up to 100°c and > 100 kda in size.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that l. rhamnosus l <dig> and l. casei l <dig> each produce factors capable of modulating inflammation stimulated by c. difficile. these vancomycin-resistant lactobacillus strains are potential probiotics for treating or preventing cdad.
