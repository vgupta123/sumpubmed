BACKGROUND
gap junction proteins, connexins, are expressed in most endocrine and exocrine glands in the body and are at least in some glands crucial for the hormonal secretion. to what extent connexins are expressed in neurons releasing hormones or neuropeptides from or within the central nervous system is, however, unknown. previous studies provide indirect evidence for gap junction coupling between subsets of neuropeptide-containing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus  of the hypothalamus. here we employ double labeling and retrograde tracing methods to investigate to what extent neuroendocrine and neuropeptide-containing neurons of the hypothalamus and brainstem express the neuronal gap junction protein connexin  <dig> 


RESULTS
western blot analysis showed that connexin  <dig> is expressed in the pvn. in bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice, which specifically express the reporter gene enhanced green fluorescent protein  under the control of the connexin  <dig> gene promoter, egfp expression was detected in magnocellular  and in parvocellular neurons of the pvn. although no egfp/connexin <dig> expression was seen in neurons containing oxytocin or vasopressin, egfp/connexin <dig> was found in subsets of pvn neurons containing corticotropin-releasing hormone , and in somatostatin neurons located along the third ventricle. moreover, crh neurons in brainstem areas, including the lateral parabrachial nucleus, also expressed egfp/connexin  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that connexin  <dig> is expressed in subsets of neuroendocrine and crh neurons in specific nuclei of the hypothalamus and brainstem.
