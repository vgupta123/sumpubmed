BACKGROUND
improving the treatment of renal cell carcinoma  will depend on the development of better biomarkers for predicting disease progression and aiding the design of appropriate therapies. one such marker may be fatty acid binding protein  <dig> , also known as b-fabp and blbp, which is expressed normally in radial glial cells of the developing central nervous system and cells of the mammary gland. melanomas, glioblastomas, and several types of carcinomas, including rcc, overexpress fabp <dig>  the abundant expression of fabp <dig> in primary rccs compared to certain rcc-derived cell lines may allow the definition of the molecular components of fabp7's regulatory system.


RESULTS
we determined fabp <dig> mrna levels in six rcc cell lines. two were highly expressed, whereas the other and the embryonic kidney cell line  were weakly expressed fabp <dig> transcripts. western blot analysis of the cell lines detected strong fabp <dig> expression only in one rcc cell line. promoter activity in the rcc cell lines was 3- to 21-fold higher than that of hek <dig>  deletion analysis demonstrated that three fabp <dig> promoter regions contributed to upregulated expression in rcc cell lines, but not in the hek <dig> cell. competition analysis of gel shifts indicated that oct <dig>  oct <dig>  and nuclear factor i  bound to the fabp <dig> promoter region. supershift experiments indicated that brn <dig>  and nfi bound to the fabp <dig> promoter region as well. there was an inverse correlation between fabp <dig> promoter activity and brn <dig> mrna expression. the fabp7-positive cell line's nfi-dna complex migrated faster than in other cell lines. levels of nfia mrna were higher in the hek <dig> cell line than in any of the six rcc cell lines. in contrast, nfic mrna expression was lower in the hek <dig> cell line than in the six rcc cell lines.


CONCLUSIONS
three putative fabp <dig> promoter regions drive reporter gene expression in rcc cell lines, but not in the hek <dig> cell line. brn <dig> and nfi may be key factors regulating the expression of fabp <dig> in certain rcc-derived cell lines.
