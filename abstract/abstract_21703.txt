BACKGROUND
functional screens based on dsrna-mediated gene silencing identified several anopheles gambiae genes that limit plasmodium berghei infection. however, some of the genes identified in these screens have no effect on the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum; raising the question of whether different mosquito effector genes mediate anti-parasitic responses to different plasmodium species.


RESULTS
four new an. gambiae  genes were identified that, when silenced, have a different effect on p. berghei  and p. falciparum  infections. orthologs of these genes, as well as lrim <dig> and ctl <dig>  were also silenced in an. stephensi  females infected with p. yoelii . for five of the six genes tested, silencing had the same effect on infection in the p. falciparum-an. gambiae and p. yoelii-an. stephensi parasite-vector combinations. although silencing lrim <dig> or ctl <dig> has no effect in an. stephensi females infected with p. yoelii, when an. gambiae is infected with the same parasite, silencing these genes has a dramatic effect. in an. gambiae , tep <dig>  lrim <dig> or lrim <dig> silencing reverts lysis and melanization of p. yoelii, while ctl <dig> silencing enhances melanization.


CONCLUSIONS
there is a broad spectrum of compatibility, the extent to which the mosquito immune system limits infection, between different plasmodium strains and particular mosquito strains that is mediated by tep1/lrim <dig> activation. the interactions between highly compatible animal models of malaria, such as p. yoelii -an. stephensi , is more similar to that of p. falciparum -an. gambiae .
