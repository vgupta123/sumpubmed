BACKGROUND
macroh2a <dig> is a histone variant that is closely associated with the repressed regions of chromosomes. a recent study revealed that this histone variant is highly enriched in the inactive alleles of imprinting control regions .


RESULTS
the current study investigates the potential roles of macroh2a <dig> in genomic imprinting by lowering the cellular levels of the macroh2a <dig> protein. rnai-based macroh2a <dig> knockdown experiments in neuro2a cells changed the expression levels of a subset of genes, including peg <dig> and usp <dig> of the peg <dig> domain. the expression of these genes was down-regulated, rather than up-regulated, in response to reduced protein levels of the potential repressor macroh2a <dig>  this down-regulation was not accompanied with changes in the dna methylation status of the peg <dig> domain.


CONCLUSIONS
macroh2a <dig> may not function as a transcriptional repressor for this domain, but that macroh2a <dig> may participate in the heterochromatin formation with functions yet to be discovered.
