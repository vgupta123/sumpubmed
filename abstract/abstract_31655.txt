BACKGROUND
drug discovery and chemical biology are exceedingly complex and demanding enterprises. in recent years there are been increasing awareness about the importance of predicting/optimizing the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity  properties of small chemical compounds along the search process rather than at the final stages. fast methods for evaluating admet properties of small molecules often involve applying a set of simple empirical rules  and as such, compound collections' property profiling can be performed in silico. clearly, these rules cannot assess the full complexity of the human body but can provide valuable information and assist decision-making.


RESULTS
this paper presents faf-drugs <dig>  a free adaptable tool for admet filtering of electronic compound collections. faf-drugs <dig> is a command line utility program  based on the open source chemistry toolkit openbabel, which performs various physicochemical calculations, identifies key functional groups, some toxic and unstable molecules/functional groups. in addition to filtered collections, faf-drugs <dig> can provide, via gnuplot, several distribution diagrams of major physicochemical properties of the screened compound libraries.


CONCLUSIONS
we have developed faf-drugs <dig> to facilitate compound collection preparation, prior to  experimental screening or virtual screening computations. users can select to apply various filtering thresholds and add rules as needed for a given project. as it stands, faf-drugs <dig> implements numerous filtering rules  that can be easily tuned.
