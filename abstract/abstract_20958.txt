BACKGROUND
canine gm <dig> gangliosidosis is a fatal disease in the shiba inu breed, which is one of the most popular traditional breeds in japan and is maintained as a standard breed in many countries. therefore, it is important to control and reduce the prevalence of gm <dig> gangliosidosis for maintaining the quality of this breed and to ensure supply of healthy dogs to prospective breeders and owners. this molecular epidemiological survey was performed to formulate an effective strategy for the control and prevention of this disease.


RESULTS
the survey was carried out among  <dig> clinically unaffected shiba inu dogs from the  <dig> districts of japan, and a genotyping test was used to determine nation-wide and regional carrier frequencies. the number and native district of affected dogs identified in  <dig> years from  <dig> to june  <dig> were also surveyed retrospectively. of the  <dig> dogs examined,  <dig> dogs  were carriers:  <dig> dogs  from the kinki district and the other  <dig> dogs from the hokkaido, kanto, and shikoku districts. the retrospective survey revealed  <dig> affected dogs, among which,  <dig> dogs  were born within the last  <dig> years. of the  <dig> affected dogs,  <dig> dogs  were from the kinki district. pedigree analysis demonstrated that all the affected dogs and carriers with the pedigree information have a close blood relationship.


CONCLUSIONS
our results showed that the current carrier frequency for gm <dig> gangliosidosis is on the average  <dig> % in japan and rather high in the kinki district, which may be related to the high prevalence observed over the past  <dig> years in this region. this observation suggests that carrier dogs are distributed all over japan; however, kennels in the kinki district may face an increased risk of gm <dig> gangliosidosis. therefore, for effective control and prevention of this disease, it is necessary to examine as many breeding dogs as possible from all regions of japan, especially from kennels located in areas with high prevalence and carrier frequency.
