BACKGROUND
directed cell migration is a fundamental process in normal development and in tumor metastasis. in c. elegans the mab-5/hox transcription factor is a determinant of posterior migration of the q neuroblast descendants. in this work, mab- <dig> transcriptional targets that control q descendant migration are identified by comparing rna-seq profiles in wild type and mab- <dig> mutant backgrounds.


RESULTS
transcriptome profiling is a widely-used and potent tool to identify genes involved in developmental and pathological processes, and is most informative when rna can be isolated from individual cell or tissue types. cell-specific rna samples can be difficult to obtain from invertebrate model organisms such as drosophila and c. elegans. here we test the utility of combining a whole organism rna-seq approach with mab- <dig> loss and gain-of-function mutants and functional validation using rnai to identify genes regulated by mab- <dig> to control q descendant migration. we identified  <dig> genes whose expression was controlled by mab- <dig> and that controlled q descendant migration. genes regulated by mab- <dig> were enriched for secreted and transmembrane molecules involved in basement membrane interaction and modification, and some affected q descendant migration.


CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that a whole-organism rna-seq approach, when combined with mutant analysis and functional validation, can be a powerful method to identify genes involved in a specific developmental process, in this case q descendant posterior migration. these genes could act either autonomously in the q cells, or non-autonomously in other cells that express mab- <dig>  the identities of the genes regulated by mab- <dig> indicate that mab- <dig> acts by modifying interactions with the basement membrane, resulting in posterior versus anterior migration.
