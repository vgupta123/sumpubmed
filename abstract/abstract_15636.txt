BACKGROUND
tolerability and efficacy of the intestinal phosphate binder lantharenol®  were tested in two prospective, randomized and negative controlled laboratory studies with healthy adult cats fed commercial maintenance diets non-restricted in phosphorus. in the first study, the maximal tolerated dose was determined. starting from a dose of  <dig>  g/kg body weight mixed with the daily feed ration, the dose of lantharenol® was doubled every other week until signs of intolerability were observed . in the second study, the effects of feed supplementation for two weeks with approximately  <dig>   <dig>  and 20% of the maximal tolerated dose on phosphorus excretion patterns and balance were assessed .


RESULTS
lantharenol® was found to be safe and well tolerated up to the dose of  <dig> g/kg bodyweight, corresponding to a concentration of  <dig> g lantharenol®/kg complete feed, defined as dry matter with a standard moisture content of 12%. feed supplementation for two weeks with approximately 2-20% of this dosage  resulted in a shift from urinary to faecal phosphorus excretion. apparent phosphorus digestibility was dose-dependently reduced compared to the control group fed with diet only .


CONCLUSIONS
the feed additive was well accepted and tolerated by all cats. therefore, lantharenol® presents a well tolerated and efficacious option to individually tailor restriction of dietary phosphorus as indicated, for instance, in feline chronic kidney disease.
