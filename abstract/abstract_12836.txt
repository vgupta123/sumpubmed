BACKGROUND
identifying developmental processes regulated by notch <dig> can be addressed in part by characterizing mice with graded levels of notch <dig> signaling strength. here we examine development in embryos expressing various combinations of notch <dig> mutant alleles. mice homozygous for the hypomorphic notch112f allele, which removes the single o-fucose glycan in epidermal growth factor-like repeat  <dig>  of the notch <dig> ligand binding domain , exhibit reduced growth after weaning and defective t cell development. mice homozygous for the inactive notch1lbd allele express notch <dig> missing an ~ <dig> kda internal segment including the canonical notch <dig> ligand binding domain, and die at embryonic day ~e <dig> . the embryonic and vascular phenotypes of compound heterozygous notch112f/lbd embryos were compared with notch1+/12f, notch112f/12f, and notch1lbd/lbd embryos. embryonic stem  cells derived from these embryos were also examined in notch signaling assays. while notch <dig> signaling was stronger in notch112f/lbd compound heterozygotes compared to notch1lbd/lbd embryos and es cells, notch <dig> signaling was even stronger in embryos carrying notch112f and a null notch <dig> allele.


RESULTS
mouse embryos expressing the hypomorphic notch112f allele, in combination with the inactive notch1lbd allele which lacks the notch <dig> ligand binding domain, died at ~e <dig> - <dig> . notch112f/lbd es cells signaled less well than notch112f/12f es cells but more strongly than notch1lbd/lbd es cells. however, vascular defects in notch112f/lbd yolk sac were severe and similar to notch1lbd/lbd yolk sac. by contrast, vascular disorganization was milder in notch112f/lbd compared to notch1lbd/lbd embryos. the expression of notch <dig> target genes was low in notch112f/lbd yolk sac and embryo head, whereas vegf and vegfr <dig> transcripts were increased. the severity of the compound heterozygous notch112f/lbd yolk sac phenotype suggested that the allelic products may functionally interact. by contrast, compound heterozygotes with notch112f in combination with a notch <dig> null allele  were capable of surviving to birth.


CONCLUSIONS
notch <dig> signaling in notch112f/lbd compound heterozygous embryos is more defective than in compound heterozygotes expressing a hypomorphic notch112f allele and a notch <dig> null allele. the data suggest that the gene products notch1lbd and notch112f interact to reduce the activity of notch112f.
