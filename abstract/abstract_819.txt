BACKGROUND
implant-related infections are caused by adhesion of bacteria to the surface of biomaterials. in this in vitro research, we evaluated the ability of staphylococcus epidermidis  to adhere to the surface of solid biomaterials at different levels of roughness below 30 nm ra and investigated the minimum level of roughness required to promote bacterial adhesion on five kinds of biomaterials: oxidized zirconium-niobium alloy , cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloy , titanium alloy , commercially pure titanium  and stainless steel , samples of which were categorized into a fine group and a coarse group according to surface roughness. the test specimens were physically analyzed and the viable bacterial density of the adhered bacteria was quantitatively determined .


RESULTS
the amount of bacteria that adhered to the biomaterials in the coarse group was higher than those in the fine group. oxinium, ti-6al-4 v and sus316l in particular demonstrated statistically significant differences between the two groups . of the materials, the co-cr-mo specimens exhibited significantly lower amounts of adhered bacteria than the ti-6al-4 v, cp-ti and sus316l specimens in the fine group. similarly, the co-cr-mo specimens in the coarse group exhibited significantly lower values than the other four materials.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that minimum level of roughness affecting initial bacterial adherence activity differs according to the type of biomaterial used, and that even a surface roughness of below 30 nm ra in oxinium, ti-6al-4 v and sus316l can promote bacterial adhesion. relative hydrophobic co-cr-mo surfaces were less susceptible to bacterial adherence.
