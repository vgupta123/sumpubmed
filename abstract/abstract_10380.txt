BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae serotype  <dig> causes > 20% of invasive disease, among all age groups combined, in the gambia. in contrast, it is rarely detected in carriage studies. this study compares the molecular epidemiology of s. pneumoniae serotype  <dig> causing invasive disease in the gambia between  <dig> and  <dig> to those carried in the nasopharynx between  <dig> and  <dig> 


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> invasive and  <dig> nasopharyngeal carriage serotype  <dig> isolates were recovered from individuals of all age groups and were analyzed by serotyping, antibiotic susceptibility testing and mlst. mlst analysis revealed  <dig> different sequence types ,  <dig> of which were novel. the most prevalent clone among the  <dig> isolates was st <dig> , followed by st <dig> , st <dig>  and st <dig> . a single st , previously shown to belong to the st <dig> hypervirulent clonal complex, was frequent among carriage  and invasive  serotype  <dig> isolates. st <dig> causing both paediatric and adult disease peaked annually in the hot dry season and caused outbreak in  <dig> and  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
for over a decade, isolates of st <dig> have been the dominant lineage among serotype  <dig> carriage and disease isolates circulating in the gambia. this lineage shows similar epidemiological features to those of the meningococcus in the african meningitis belt being able to cause outbreaks of disease
