BACKGROUND
using quantitative methylation-specific pcr  is a promising method for colorectal cancer  diagnosis from stool samples. difficulty in eliminating pcr inhibitors of this body fluid has been extensively reported. here, spermidine is presented as pcr facilitator for the detection of stool dna methylation biomarkers using qm-msp. we examined its effectiveness with npy, penk and wif <dig>  three biomarkers which we have previously shown to be of relevance to crc.


RESULTS
we determined an optimal window for the amplification of the albumin  gene  at which we report that spermidine acts as a pcr facilitator  for sg rt-pcr. we show that the amplification of methylated penk, npy and wif <dig> is considerably facilitated by qm-msp as measured by an increase of cmi  by a factor of  <dig>  to  <dig> fold in individual samples, and of  <dig> fold in a pool of five samples.


CONCLUSIONS
we contend that spermidine greatly reduces the problems of pcr inhibition in stool samples. this observed feature, after validation on a larger sampling, could be used in the development of stool-based crc diagnosis tests.
