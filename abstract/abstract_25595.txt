BACKGROUND
heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate staphylococcus aureus  bacteremia is an emerging infection. our objective was to determine the molecular features of hvisa strains isolated from bacteremic patients and to compare them to methicillin resistant s. aureus  and methicillin sensitive s. aureus  blood isolates.


RESULTS
we assessed phenotypic and genomic changes of hvisa , mrsa  and mssa  isolates by pcr to determine staphylococcal chromosomal cassette  types, panton-valentine leukocidin  and the accessory gene regulator  loci. biofilm formation was quantified. genetic relatedness was assessed by pfge. pfge analysis of isolates was diverse suggesting multiple sources of infection. 50% of hvisa isolates carried sccmec type i, 21% type ii; 25% type v; in 4% the sccmec type could not be identified. among mrsa isolates, 44% were sccmec type i,  <dig> % type ii, 25% type v,  <dig> % were non-typable, and 6% were sccmec type ivd. only one hvisa isolate and two mssa isolates carried the pvl. biofilm formation and agr patterns were diverse.


CONCLUSIONS
hvisa isolates were diverse in all parameters tested. a considerable number of hvisa and mrsa strains carried the sccmec type v cassette, which was not related to community acquisition.
