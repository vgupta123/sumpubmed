BACKGROUND
riemerella anatipestifer is one of the most important pathogens of ducks. however, the molecular mechanisms of r. anatipestifer infection are poorly understood. in particular, the lack of genomic information from a variety of r. anatipestifer strains has proved severely limiting.


RESULTS
in this study, we present the complete genomes of two r. anatipestifer strains, ra-ch- <dig>  and ra-ch- <dig> . both strains are from isolates taken from two different sick ducks in the sichuang province of china. a comparative genomics approach was used to identify similarities and key differences between ra-ch- <dig> and ra-ch- <dig> and the previously sequenced strain ra-gd, a clinical isolate from guangdong, china, and atcc <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the genomes of ra-ch- <dig> and ra-gd were extremely similar, while ra-ch- <dig> was significantly different than atcc <dig>  ra-ch- <dig> is  <dig>  bp larger than the three other strains and has  <dig> unique gene families. evolutionary analysis shows that ra-ch- <dig> and ra-ch- <dig> are closed and in a branch with atcc <dig>  while ra-gd is located in another branch. additionally, the detection of several iron/heme-transport related proteins and motility mechanisms will be useful in elucidating factors important in pathogenicity. this information will allow a better understanding of the phenotype of different r. anatipestifer strains and molecular mechanisms of infection.
