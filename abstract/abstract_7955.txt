BACKGROUND
panax japonicus c. a. mey. is a rare traditional chinese herbal medicine that uses ginsenosides as its main active ingredient. rice does not produce ginsenosides because it lacks a key rate-limiting enzyme ; however, it produces a secondary metabolite,  <dig> -oxidosqualene, which is a precursor for ginsenoside biosynthesis.


RESULTS
in the present study, the p. japonicus βas gene was transformed into the rice cultivar ‘taijing 9’ using an agrobacterium-mediated approach, resulting in  <dig> rice transgenic plants of the t <dig> generation. transfer-dna  insertion sites in homozygous lines of the t <dig> generation were determined by using high-efficiency thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr  and were found to vary among the tested lines. approximately 1– <dig> copies of the βas gene were detected in transgenic rice plants. real-time pcr and western blotting analyses showed that the transformed βas gene could be overexpressed and β-amyrin synthase could be expressed in rice. hplc analysis showed that the concentration of oleanane-type sapogenin oleanolic acid in transgenic rice was  <dig> – <dig>  mg/100 g dw.


CONCLUSIONS
the current study is the first report on the transformation of p. japonicus βas gene into rice. we have successfully produced a new rice germplasm, “ginseng rice”, which produces oleanane-type sapogenin.
