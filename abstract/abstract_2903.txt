BACKGROUND
setaria viridis has emerged as a model species for the larger c <dig> grasses. here the cellulose synthase  superfamily has been defined, with an emphasis on the amounts and distribution of -β-glucan, a cell wall polysaccharide that is characteristic of the grasses and is of considerable value for human health.

methods
orthologous relationship of the cesa and poales-specific cellulose synthase-like  genes among setaria italica , sorghum bicolor , oryza sativa , brachypodium distachyon  and hordeum vulgare  were compared using bioinformatics analysis. transcription profiling of csl gene families, which are involved in -β-glucan synthesis, was performed using real-time quantitative pcr . the amount of -β-glucan was measured using a modified megazyme assay. the fine structures of the -β-glucan, as denoted by the ratio of cellotriosyl to cellotetraosyl residues  was assessed by chromatography . the distribution and deposition of the mlg was examined using the specific antibody bg- <dig> and captured using fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy .


RESULTS
the cellulose synthase gene superfamily contains  <dig> cesa and  <dig> csl genes in setaria. transcript profiling of cslf, cslh and cslj gene families across a vegetative tissue series indicated that svcslf <dig> transcripts were the most abundant relative to all other csl transcripts. the amounts of -β-glucan in setaria vegetative tissues ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % w/w with much smaller amounts in developing grain . in general, the amount of -β-glucan was greater in younger than in older tissues. the dp3:dp <dig> ratios varied between tissue types and across developmental stages, and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> : <dig>  the dp3:dp <dig> ratios in developing grain ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> : <dig>  micrographs revealing the distribution of -β-glucan in walls of different cell types and the data were consistent with the quantitative -β-glucan assays.


CONCLUSIONS
the characteristics of the cellulose synthase gene superfamily and the accumulation and distribution of -β-glucans in setaria are similar to those in other c <dig> grasses, including sorghum. this suggests that setaria is a suitable model plant for cell wall polysaccharide biology in c <dig> grasses.
