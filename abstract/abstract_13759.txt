BACKGROUND
our aim was to determine if pramipexole, a d <dig> preferring agonist, effectively reduced dopamine neuron and fiber loss in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydropyridine  mouse model when given at intraperitoneal doses corresponding to clinical doses. we also determined whether subchronic treatment with pramipexole regulates dopamine transporter function, thereby reducing intracellular transport of the active metabolite of mptp, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium .

methods
ten 12-month old c57bl/ <dig> mice were treated with mptp  twice per day at  <dig> mg/kg s.c. . mice were pretreated for  <dig> days and during the 2-day mptp regimen with pramipexole  or saline. stereological quantification of dopamine neuron number and optical density measurement of dopamine fiber loss were carried out at  <dig> week after treatment, using immunostaining for dopamine transporter  and tyrosine hydroxylase . additional wild-type  and d <dig> receptor knockout  mice were treated for  <dig> days with pramipexole  or vehicle. the kinetics of mpp+ and da uptake  were determined  <dig> h later; and at  <dig> h and  <dig> days dopamine transporter density was measured by quantitative autoradiography.


RESULTS
pramipexole treatment completely antagonized the neurotoxic effects of mptp, as measured by substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area th-immunoreactive cell counts. mptp- induced loss of striatal innervation, as measured by dat-immunoreactivity, was partially prevented by pramipexole, but not with regard to th-ir. pramipexole also reduced dat- immunoreactivity in non-mptp treated mice. subchronic treatment with pramipexole lowered the vmax for da and mpp+ uptake into striatal synaptosomes of wt mice. pramipexole treatment lowered vmax in wt but not d <dig> ko mice; however, d <dig> ko mice had lower vmax for da uptake. there was no change in dat number in wt with pramipexole treatment or d <dig> ko mice at  <dig> h post-treatment, but there was a reduction in wt-pramipexole treated and not in d <dig> ko mice at  <dig> days post-treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that protection occurs at clinically suitable doses of pramipexole. protection could be due to a reduced amount of mpp+ taken up into da terminals via dat. d <dig> receptor plays an important role in this regulation of transporter uptake and availability.
