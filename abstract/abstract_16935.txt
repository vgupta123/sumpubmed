BACKGROUND
small bioinformatics databases, unlike institutionally funded large databases, are vulnerable to discontinuation and many reported in publications are no longer accessible. this leads to irreproducible scientific work and redundant effort, impeding the pace of scientific progress.


RESULTS
we describe a web-accessible system, available online at http://biodb <dig> apbionet.org, for archival and future on demand re-instantiation of small databases within minutes. depositors can rebuild their databases by downloading a linux live operating system , preinstalled with bioinformatics and unix tools. the database and its dependencies can be compressed into an ".lzm" file for deposition. end-users can search for archived databases and activate them on dynamically re-instantiated bioslax instances, run as virtual machines over the two popular full virtualization standard cloud-computing platforms, xen hypervisor or vsphere. the system is adaptable to increasing demand for disk storage or computational load and allows database developers to use the re-instantiated databases for integration and development of new databases.


CONCLUSIONS
herein, we demonstrate that a relatively inexpensive solution can be implemented for archival of bioinformatics databases and their rapid re-instantiation should the live databases disappear.
