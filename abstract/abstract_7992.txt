BACKGROUND
mirnas play essential roles in the modulation of cellular functions via degradation and/or translation attenuation of target mrnas. they have been surveyed in a single ascidian genus, ciona. recently, an annotated draft genome sequence for a distantly related ascidian, halocynthia roretzi, has become available, but mirnas in h. roretzi have not been previously studied.


RESULTS
we report the prediction of  <dig> candidate h. roretzi mirnas, obtained through three complementary methods. experimental validation suggests that more than half of these candidate mirnas are expressed during embryogenesis. the majority of predicted h. roretzi mirnas appear specific to ascidians or tunicates, and only  <dig> candidates, belonging to  <dig> families, are widely conserved across metazoans.


CONCLUSIONS
our study presents a comprehensive identification of candidate h. roretzi mirnas. this resource will facilitate the study of the mechanisms for mirna-controlled gene regulatory networks during ascidian development. further, our analysis suggests that the majority of halocynthia mirnas are specific to ascidian or tunicates, with only a small number of widely conserved mirnas. this result is consistent with the general notion that animal mirnas are less conserved between taxa than plant ones.
