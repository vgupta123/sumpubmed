BACKGROUND
burkholderia thailandensis, a close relative of burkholderia pseudomallei, has previously been reported only from southeast asia and north america. it is biochemically differentiated from b. pseudomallei by the ability to utilize arabinose. during the course of environmental sampling for b. pseudomallei in the northern territory of australia, an isolate, msmb  <dig>  was recovered that is arabinose positive.


RESULTS
genetic analysis using 16s rdna sequencing and dna/dna hybridization indicates that msmb  <dig> is most similar to b. thailandensis although multi-locus sequence typing indicates that this isolate is divergent from both b. pseudomallei and other described b. thailandensis.


CONCLUSIONS
we report the isolation and initial characterization of strain msmb  <dig>  which is a b. thailandensis-like isolate recovered in australia.
