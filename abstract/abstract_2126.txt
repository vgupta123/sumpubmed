BACKGROUND
multiple myeloma  is a clonal b-cell disorder with many immunological disturbances. the aim of this work was to assess whether some of food antigens contribute to the imbalance of immune response by screening the sera of mm patients for their immunoreactivity to food constituent gliadin, to tissue transglutaminase- <dig>  and to ro/ssa antigen.

sera from  <dig> patients with mm in various stages of disease, before, or after some cycles of conventional therapy were analyzed by commercial binding site elisa tests. the control group consisted of  <dig> healthy volunteers. statistical analysis of data obtained was performed by mann whitney test.


RESULTS
the higher serum iga immunoreactivity to gliadin was found in 14/ <dig> patients and in one of control people. the enhanced serum igg immunoreactivity to gliadin was found in only two of tested patients and in two controls. the enhanced iga immunoreactivity to ttg- <dig> was found in 10/ <dig> patients' sera, while 4/ <dig> patients had higher serum igg immunoreactivity. the enhanced serum igg immunoreactivity to ross√Ä antigen was found in 9/ <dig> analyzed mm patients' sera. statistical analysis of data obtained revealed that only the levels of anti-ttg- <dig> iga immunoreactivity in patients with mm were significantly higher than these obtained in healthy controls 


CONCLUSIONS
data obtained showed the existence of the enhanced serum immunoreactivity to gliadin, ttg- <dig> and ro/ssa antigens in some patients with mm. these at least partially could contribute to the immunological imbalance frequently found in this disease.
