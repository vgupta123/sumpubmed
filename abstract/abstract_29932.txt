BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile is an important bacterial pathogen of humans and a variety of animal species. birds, especially migratory passerine species, can play a role in the spread of many pathogens, including clostridium difficile. barn swallows  nest in close proximity to human habitats and their biology is closely associated with cattle farming. therefore, we hypothesized that barn swallows can be the reservoir of clostridium difficile.


RESULTS
barn swallows  were captured on their autumn migration across europe to sub-saharan africa. droppings were collected from juvenile  and adult birds . overall prevalence of clostridium difficile was 4% ;  <dig> %  in juvenile birds and 0/ <dig> in adults. clostridium difficile ribotypes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were identified, which are commonly found in farm animals and humans. three new clostridium difficile ribotypes were also identified: sb <dig>  sb <dig> and sb <dig>  one of which was toxigenic, harbouring genes for toxins a and b.


CONCLUSIONS
results of this study indicate that barn swallows might play a role in national and international dissemination of clostridium difficile and could serve as a source for human and animal infection. clostridium difficile ribotype  <dig> was identified, which has been reported as an emerging cause of community-associated clostridium difficile infection in humans. based on this and other studies, however, it is more likely that barn swallows have a more indicative than perpetuating role in clostridium difficile epidemiology.
