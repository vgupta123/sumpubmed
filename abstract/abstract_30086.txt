BACKGROUND
the phytohormone auxin mediates a stunning array of plant development through the functions of auxin response factors , which belong to transcription factors and are present as a protein family comprising 10– <dig> members so far identified in different plant species. plant development is also subject to regulation by transparent testa glabra  proteins, such as ntttg <dig> that we recently characterized in tobacco nicotiana tabacum. to find the functional linkage between ttg and auxin in the regulation of plant development, we performed de novo assembly of the tobacco transcriptome to identify candidates of ntttg2-regulated arf genes.


RESULTS
the role of ntttg <dig> in tobacco growth and development was studied by analyzing the biological effects of gene silencing and overexpression. the ntttg <dig> gene silencing causes repressive effects on vegetative growth, floral anthocyanin synthesis, flower colorization, and seed production. by contrast, the plant growth and development processes are promoted by ntttg <dig> overexpression. the growth/developmental function of ntttg <dig> associates with differential expression of putative arf genes identified by de novo assembly of the tobacco transcriptome. the transcriptome contains a total of  <dig>  unigenes, including  <dig>  unigenes  with annotated functions and at least  <dig>  unigenes  assigned to plant growth and development. the transcriptome also contains  <dig> unigenes  related to auxin responses, including  <dig> putative arf genes. based on quantitative analyses, the expression of the putative genes is either promoted or inhibited by ntttg <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the biological effects of the ntttg <dig> gene silencing and overexpression suggest that ntttg <dig> is an essential regulator of growth and development in tobacco. the effects of the altered ntttg <dig> expression on expression levels of putative arf genes identified in the transcriptome suggest that ntttg <dig> functions in relation to arf transcription factors.
