BACKGROUND
pathogenic yersiniae  share a virulence plasmid encoding a type three secretion system . this t3ss comprises more than  <dig> constituents. among these are the transport substrates called yops , the specific yop chaperones , and the ysc  proteins which form the transport machinery. the effectors yopo and yopp are encoded on an operon together with syco, the chaperone of yopo. the characterization of syco is the focus of this study.


RESULTS
we have established the large-scale production of recombinant syco in its outright form. we confirm that y. enterocolitica syco forms homodimers which is typical for syc chaperones. syco overproduction in y. enterocolitica decreases secretion of yops into the culture supernatant suggesting a regulatory role of syco in type iii secretion. we demonstrate that in vitro syco interacts with yscm <dig>  a negative regulator of yop expression in y. enterocolitica. however, the syco overproduction phenotype was not mediated by yscm <dig>  yscm <dig>  yopo or yopp as revealed by analysis of isogenic deletion mutants.


CONCLUSIONS
we present evidence that syco is integrated into the regulatory network of the yersinia t3ss. our picture of the yersinia t3ss interactome is supplemented by identification of the syco/yscm <dig> interaction. further, our results suggest that at least one additional interaction partner of syco has to be identified.
