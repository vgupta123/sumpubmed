BACKGROUND
it is widely recognized that interspecific hybridization may induce "genome shock", and lead to genetic and epigenetic instabilities in the resultant hybrids and/or backcrossed introgressants. a prominent component involved in the genome shock is reactivation of cryptic transposable elements  in the hybrid genome, which is often associated with alteration in the elements' epigenetic modifications like cytosine dna methylation. we have previously reported that introgressants derived from hybridization between oryza sativa  and zizania latifolia manifested substantial methylation re-patterning and rampant mobilization of two tes, a copia retrotransposon tos <dig> and a mite mping. it was not known however whether other types of tes had also been transpositionally reactivated in these introgressants, their relevance to alteration in cytosine methylation, and their impact on expression of adjacent cellular genes.


RESULTS
we document in this study that the dart te family was transpositionally reactivated followed by stabilization in all three studied introgressants  derived from introgressive hybridization between rice  and z. latifolia, while the tes remained quiescent in the recipient rice genome. transposon-display  and sequencing verified the element's mobility and mapped the excisions and re-insertions to the rice chromosomes. methylation-sensitive southern blotting showed that the dart tes were heavily methylated along their entire length, and moderate alteration in cytosine methylation patterns occurred in the introgressants relative to their rice parental line. real-time qrt-pcr quantification on the relative transcript abundance of six single-copy genes flanking the newly excised or inserted dart-related te copies indicated that whereas marked difference in the expression of all four genes in both tissues  were detected between the introgressants and their rice parental line under both normal and various stress conditions, the difference showed little association with the presence or absence of the newly mobilized dart-related tes.


CONCLUSIONS
introgressive hybridization has induced transpositional reactivation of the otherwise immobile dart-related tes in the parental rice line , which was accompanied with a moderate alteration in the element's cytosine methylation. significant difference in expression of the dart-adjacent genes occurred between the introgressants and their rice parental line under both normal and various abiotic stress conditions, but the alteration in gene expression was not coupled with the tes.
