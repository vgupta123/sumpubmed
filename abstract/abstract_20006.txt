BACKGROUND
the view that gene flow between related animal species is rare and evolutionarily unimportant largely antedates sensitive molecular techniques. here we use dna sequencing to investigate a pair of morphologically and ecologically divergent, non-sibling butterfly species, heliconius cydno and h. melpomene , whose distributions overlap in central and northwestern south america.


RESULTS
in these taxa, we sequenced 30– <dig> haplotypes per locus of a mitochondrial region containing the genes for cytochrome oxidase subunits i and ii , and intron-spanning fragments of three unlinked nuclear loci: triose-phosphate isomerase , mannose-6-phosphate isomerase  and cubitus interruptus  genes. a fifth gene, dopa decarboxylase  produced sequence data likely to be from different duplicate loci in some of the taxa, and so was excluded. mitochondrial and tpi genealogies are consistent with reciprocal monophyly, whereas sympatric populations of the species in panama share identical or similar mpi and ci haplotypes, giving rise to genealogical polyphyly at the species level despite evidence for rapid sequence divergence at these genes between geographic races of h. melpomene.


CONCLUSIONS
recent transfer of mpi haplotypes between species is strongly supported, but there is no evidence for introgression at the other three loci. our results demonstrate that the boundaries between animal species can remain selectively porous to gene flow long after speciation, and that introgression, even between non-sibling species, can be an important factor in animal evolution. interspecific gene flow is demonstrated here for the first time in   heliconius and may provide a route for the transfer of switch-gene adaptations for müllerian mimicry. the results also forcefully demonstrate how reliance on a single locus may give an erroneous picture of the overall genealogical history of speciation and gene flow.
