BACKGROUND
the fertile and sterile plants were derived from the self-pollinated offspring of the f <dig> hybrid between the novel restorer line nr <dig> and the nsa cms line in brassica napus. to elucidate gene expression and regulation caused by the a and c subgenomes of b. napus, as well as the alien chromosome and cytoplasm from sinapis arvensis during the development of young floral buds, we performed a genome-wide high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing for young floral buds of sterile and fertile plants.


RESULTS
in this study, equal amounts of total rnas taken from young floral buds of sterile and fertile plants were sequenced using the illumina/solexa platform. after filtered out low quality data, a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean tags were remained in the two libraries, from which  <dig>   and  <dig>   distinct tags were obtained. all distinct sequencing tags were annotated using all possible catg+17-nt sequences of the genome and transcriptome of brassica rapa and those of brassica oleracea as the reference sequences, respectively. in total,  <dig> genes of b. rapa and  <dig> genes of b. oleracea were detected with significant differential expression levels. go and pathway-based analyses were performed to determine and further to understand the biological functions of those differentially expressed genes . in addition, there were  <dig> specially expressed unknown tags in fer, which were neither mapped to b. oleracea nor to b. rapa, and these unique tags were presumed to arise basically from the added alien chromosome of s. arvensis. fifteen genes were randomly selected and their expression levels were confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr, and fourteen of them showed consistent expression patterns with the digital gene expression  data.


CONCLUSIONS
a number of genes were differentially expressed between the young floral buds of sterile and fertile plants. some of these genes may be candidates for future research on cms in nsa line, fertility restoration and improved agronomic traits in nr <dig> line. further study of the unknown tags which were specifically expressed in fer will help to explore desirable agronomic traits from wild species.
