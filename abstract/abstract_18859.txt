BACKGROUND
beta-lactam resistance in haemophilus influenzae due to ftsi mutations causing altered penicillin-binding protein  <dig>  is increasing worldwide. low-level resistant isolates with the n526k substitution  predominate in most geographical regions, while high-level resistant isolates with the additional s385t substitution  are common in japan and south korea.

knowledge about the molecular epidemiology of rpbp <dig> strains is limited. we combined multilocus sequence typing  and ftsi/pbp <dig> typing to study the emergence and spread of rpbp <dig> in nontypeable h. influenzae  in norway.


RESULTS
the prevalence of rpbp <dig> in a population of  <dig> eye, ear and respiratory isolates  from  <dig> was 15%. the prevalence of clinical pbp3-mediated resistance to ampicillin was 9%, compared to  <dig> % three years earlier. group ii low-rpbp <dig> predominated , with significant proportions of isolates non-susceptible to cefotaxime  and meropenem . group iii high-rpbp <dig> was identified for the first time in northern europe.

four mlst sequence types  with characteristic, highly diverging ftsi alleles accounted for 61% of the rpbp <dig> isolates. the most prevalent substitution pattern  was present in 41% of rpbp <dig> isolates, mainly carried by st <dig> and st <dig>  several unrelated sts possessed identical copies of the ftsi allele encoding pbp <dig> type a.

infection sites, age groups, hospitalization rates and rpbp <dig> frequencies differed between sts and phylogenetic groups.


CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first to link ftsi alleles to sts in h. influenzae. the results indicate that horizontal gene transfer contributes to the emergence of rpbp <dig> by phylogeny restricted transformation.

clonally related virulent rpbp <dig> strains are widely disseminated and high-level resistant isolates emerge in new geographical regions, threatening current empiric antibiotic treatment. the need of continuous monitoring of beta-lactam susceptibility and a global system for molecular surveillance of rpbp <dig> strains is underlined. combining mlst and ftsi/pbp <dig> typing is a powerful tool for this purpose.
