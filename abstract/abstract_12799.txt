BACKGROUND
gastrointestinal nematode  infection is one of the main constraints to sheep production both in temperate and tropical countries. economic losses caused by gin are related to decreased production, treatment costs and even animal death. the present paper was aimed at assessing the anthelmintic efficacy  of moxidectin and ivermectin both admistered per os at dose rate of  <dig>  mg/kg body weight and the benefit of anthelmintic treatments on milk production in a commercial dairy sheep farms in central italy whose animals were naturally infected by gin.


RESULTS
the treatment with moxidectin was highly effective  from day  <dig> until day  <dig>  and effective  until day  <dig>  the treatment with ivermectin was highly effective  from day  <dig> until day  <dig>  effective  at day  <dig> and moderately effective  on day  <dig>  the milk productions in the treated groups were significantly higher than those of the control group.


CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that moxidectin and ivermectin adminstered per os according to the manufacturer's instructions were both effective and safe anthelmintics in sheep. the total milk production was higher in the treated groups than the control group. overall, animals treated with moxidectin had a milk production  <dig> % higher than control group; whereas animals treated with ivermectin had a milk production  <dig> % higher than control group.
