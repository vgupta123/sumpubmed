BACKGROUND
different methods have been proposed for analyzing differentially expressed  genes in microarray data. methods based on statistical tests that incorporate expression level variability are used more commonly than those based on fold change . however, fc based results are more reproducible and biologically relevant.


RESULTS
we propose a new method based on fold change rank ordering statistics . we exploit the variation in calculated fc levels using combinatorial pairs of biological conditions in the datasets. a statistic is associated with the ranks of the fc values for each gene, and the resulting probability is used to identify the de genes within an error level. the fcros method is deterministic, requires a low computational runtime and also solves the problem of multiple tests which usually arises with microarray datasets.


CONCLUSIONS
we compared the performance of fcros with those of other methods using synthetic and real microarray datasets. we found that fcros is well suited for de gene identification from noisy datasets when compared with existing fc based methods.
