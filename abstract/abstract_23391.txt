BACKGROUND
the human necdin gene is involved in a neurodevelopmental disorder, prader-willi syndrome . previously we reported a mouse necdin knock-out model with similar defects to pws patients. despite the putative roles attributed to necdin, mainly from in vitro studies, its in vivo function remains unclear. in this study, we investigate sensory-motor behaviour in necdin deficient mice. we reveal cellular defects and analyse their cause.


RESULTS
we report sensory differences in necdin deficient mice compared to wild type animals. these differences led us to investigate sensory neuron development in necdin deficient mouse embryos. first, we describe the expression pattern of necdin in developing drgs and report a reduction of one-third in specified sensory neurons in dorsal roots ganglia and show that this neuronal loss is achieved by e <dig> , when drgs sensory neurons are specified. in parallel, we observed an increase of 41% in neuronal apoptosis during the wave of naturally occurring cell death at e <dig> . since it is assumed that necdin is a p75ntr interactor, we looked at the p75ntr-expressing cell population in necdin knock-out embryos. unexpectedly, necdin loss of function has no effect on p75ntr expressing neurons suggesting no direct genetic interaction between necdin and p75ntr in this context.

although we exclude a role of necdin in axonal outgrowth from spinal sensory neurons in early developmental stages; such a role could occur later in neuronal differentiation. finally we also exclude an anti-proliferative role of necdin in developing sensory neurons.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, our data show clearly that, in early development of the nervous system, necdin is an anti-apoptotic or survival factor.
