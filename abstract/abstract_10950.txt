BACKGROUND
wine fermentation is a harsh ecological niche to which wine yeast are well adapted. the initial high osmotic pressure and acidity of grape juice is followed by nutrient depletion and increasing concentrations of ethanol as the fermentation progresses. yeast’s adaptation to these and many other environmental stresses, enables successful completion of high-sugar fermentations. earlier transcriptomic and growth studies have tentatively identified genes important for high-sugar fermentation. whilst useful, such studies did not consider extended growth  in a temporally dynamic multi-stressor environment such as that found in many industrial fermentation processes. here, we identify genes whose deletion has minimal or no effect on growth, but results in failure to achieve timely completion of the fermentation of a chemically defined grape juice with  <dig> g l− <dig> total sugar.


RESULTS
micro- and laboratory-scale experimental fermentations were conducted to identify  <dig> clones from ~ <dig>  homozygous diploid single-gene yeast deletants, which exhibited protracted fermentation in a high-sugar medium. another  <dig> clones  were also included. clustering and numerical enrichment of genes annotated to specific gene ontology  terms highlighted the vacuole’s role in ion homeostasis and ph regulation, through vacuole acidification.


CONCLUSIONS
we have identified  <dig> genes whose deletion resulted in the duration of fermentation being at least 20% longer than the wild type. an extreme phenotype, ‘stuck’ fermentation, was also observed when doa <dig>  npt <dig>  plc <dig>  ptk <dig>  sin <dig>  ssq <dig>  tps <dig>  tps <dig> or zap <dig> were deleted. these  <dig> fermentation essential genes  are required to complete an extended high-sugar  fermentation. their importance is highlighted in our fermentation relevant yeast genes  database, generated from literature and the fermentation-relevant phenotypic characteristics of null mutants described in the saccharomyces genome database. the 93-gene set is collectively referred to as the ‘fermentome’. the fact that  <dig> genes highlighted in this study have not previously been linked to fermentation-related stresses, supports our experimental rationale. these findings, together with investigations of the genetic diversity of industrial strains, are crucial for understanding the mechanisms behind yeast’s response and adaptation to stresses imposed during high-sugar fermentations.
