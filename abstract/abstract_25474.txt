BACKGROUND
representatives of the genus bacillus are increasingly used in agriculture to promote plant growth and to protect against plant pathogens. unfortunately, hitherto the impact of bacillus inoculants on the indigenous plant microbiota has been investigated exclusively for the species bacillus amyloliquefaciens and was limited to prokaryotes, whilst eukaryotic member of this community, e.g. fungi, were not considered.


RESULTS
the root-colonizing bacillus subtilis pts- <dig> supported growth of tomato plants and suppressed soil-borne diseases. roche  <dig> pyrosequencing revealed that pts- <dig> has only a transient impact on the microbiota community of the tomato rhizosphere. the impact on eukaryota could last up to 14 days, while that on bacterial communities lasted for 3 days only.


CONCLUSIONS
ecological adaptation and microbial community-preserving capacity are important criteria when assessing suitability of bio-inoculants for commercial development. as shown here, b. subtilis pts- <dig> is acting as an environmentally compatible plant protective agent without permanent effects on rhizosphere microbial community.
