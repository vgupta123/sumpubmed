BACKGROUND
in the biotechnological workhorse trichoderma reesei  transcription of cellulase genes as well as efficiency of the secreted cellulase mixture are modulated by light. components of the heterotrimeric g-protein pathway interact with light-dependent signals, rendering this pathway a key regulator of cellulase gene expression.


RESULTS
as regulators of heterotrimeric g-protein signaling, class i phosducin-like proteins, are assumed to act as co-chaperones for g-protein beta-gamma folding and exert their function in response to light in higher eukaryotes. our results revealed light responsive transcription of the t. reesei class i phosducin-like protein gene phlp <dig> and indicate a light dependent function of phlp <dig> also in fungi. we showed the functions of phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> in the same pathway, with one major output being the regulation of transcription of glycoside hydrolase genes including cellulase genes in t. reesei. we found no direct correlation between the growth rate and global regulation of glycoside hydrolases, which suggests that regulation of growth does not occur only at the level of substrate degradation efficiency.

additionally, phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> are all important for proper regulation of light responsiveness during long term exposure. in their absence, the amount of light regulated genes increased from  <dig> % in wild type to 14% in Δphlp <dig>  besides from the regulation of degradative enzymes, phlp <dig> was also found to impact on the transcription of genes involved in sexual development, which was in accordance with decreased efficiency of fruiting body formation in Δphlp <dig>  the lack of gnb <dig> drastically diminished ascospore discharge in t. reesei.


CONCLUSIONS
the heterotrimeric g-protein pathway is crucial for the interconnection of nutrient signaling and light response of t. reesei, with the class i phosducin-like protein phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> acting as important nodes, which influence light responsiveness, glycoside hydrolase gene transcription and sexual development.
