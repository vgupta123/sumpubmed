BACKGROUND
new neurons are generated in the adult brain from stem cells found in the subventricular zone . these cells proliferate in the svz, generating neuroblasts which then migrate to the main olfactory bulb , ending their migration in the glomerular layer  and the granule cell layer  of the mob. neuronal populations in these layers undergo turnover throughout life, but whether all neuronal subtypes found in these areas are replaced and when neurons begin to express subtype-specific markers is not known.


RESULTS
here we use brdu injections and immunohistochemistry against  and show that adult-generated neurons express markers of all major subtypes of neurons in the gll and gcl. moreover, the fractions of new neurons that express subtype-specific markers at  <dig> and  <dig> days post brdu injection are very similar to the fractions of all neurons expressing these markers. we also show that many neurons in the glomerular layer do not express neun, but are readily and specifically labeled by the fluorescent nissl stain neurotrace.


CONCLUSIONS
the expression of neuronal subtype-specific markers by new neurons in the gll and gcl changes rapidly during the period from 14â€“ <dig> days after brdu injection before reaching adult levels. this period may represent a critical window for cell fate specification similar to that observed for neuronal survival.
