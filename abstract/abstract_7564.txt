BACKGROUND
graph-based notions are increasingly used in biomedical data mining and knowledge discovery tasks. in this paper, we present a clique-clustering method to automatically summarize graphs of semantic predications produced from pubmed citations .


RESULTS
semrep is used to extract semantic predications from the citations returned by a pubmed search. cliques were identified from frequently occurring predications with highly connected arguments filtered by degree centrality. themes contained in the summary were identified with a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on common arguments shared among cliques. the validity of the clusters in the summaries produced was compared to the silhouette-generated baseline for cohesion, separation and overall validity. the theme labels were also compared to a reference standard produced with major mesh headings.


CONCLUSIONS
for  <dig> topics in the testing data set, the overall validity of clusters from the system summary was 10% better than the baseline . while compared to the reference standard from mesh headings, the results for recall, precision and f-score were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  respectively.
