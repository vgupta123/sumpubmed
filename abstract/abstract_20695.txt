BACKGROUND
novel, uncharacterised proteins represent a challenge in biochemistry and molecular biology. in this report we present an initial functional characterization of human kidney predominant protein, ncu-g <dig> 


RESULTS
ncu-g <dig> was found to be a highly conserved nuclear protein rich in proline with a molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda. it is localized on chromosome  <dig> and consists of  <dig> exons. analysis of the amino acid sequence revealed no known transcription activation domains or dna binding regions, however, four nuclear receptor boxes , and four sh3-interaction motives in addition to numerous potential phosphorylation sites were found. two nuclear export signals were identified, but no nuclear localization signal. in man, ncu-g <dig> was found to be widely expressed at the mrna level with especially high levels detected in prostate, liver and kidney. electrophoretic mobility shift analysis showed specific binding of ncu-g <dig> to an oligonucleotide representing the footprint  <dig> element of the human cellular retinol-binding protein  <dig> gene promoter. ncu-g <dig> was found to activate transcription from this promoter and required presence of the footprint  <dig> element. in transiently transfected drosophila schneider s <dig> cells, we demonstrated that ncu-g <dig> functions as a co-activator for ligand-activated ppar-alpha, resulting in an increased expression of a cat reporter gene under control of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha responsive acyl-coa oxidase promoter.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that ncu-g <dig> is a dual-function protein capable of functioning as a transcription factor as well as a nuclear receptor co-activator.
