BACKGROUND
recently, some groups have reported on cell-free synthesis of functional membrane proteins  in the presence of exogenous liposomes . previously, we reported synthesis of a functional atppt <dig> plant phosphate transporter that was associated with liposomes during translation. however, it is unclear whether or not lipid/mp complex formation is common to all types of mps in the wheat cell-free system.


RESULTS
atppt <dig> was synthesized using a wheat cell-free system with or without liposomes. atppt <dig> synthesized with liposomes showed high transport activity, but the activity of atppt <dig> synthesized without liposomes was less than 10% activity of that with liposomes. to test whether co-translational association with liposomes is observed in the synthesis of other mps, we used  <dig> mammalian mps having one to  <dig> transmembrane domains  and five soluble proteins as a control. the association rate of all  <dig> mps into liposomes was more than 40% , while that of the five soluble proteins was less than 20% . there were no significant differences in association rate among mps regardless of the number of tmds and synthesis yield. these results indicate that the wheat cell-free system is a highly productive method for lipid/mp complex formation and is suitable for large-scale preparation. the liposome association of green fluorescent protein -fusion mps were also tested and recovered as lipid/mp complex after floatation by accudenz density gradient ultracentrifugation . employment of gfp-mps revealed optimal condition for accudenz floatation. using the optimized accudenz dgu condition, p2rx4/lipid complexes were partially purified and detected as a major band by coomassie brilliant blue -staining after sds-page.


CONCLUSIONS
formation of lipid/atppt <dig> complex during the cell-free synthesis reaction is critical for synthesis of a functional mp. the lipid/mp complex during the translation was observed in all  <dig> mps tested. at least  <dig> mps, as judged by their higher productivity compared to gfp, might be suitable for a large-scale preparation. mps synthesized by this method form lipid/mp complexes, which could be readily partially purified by accudenz dgu. wheat cell-free protein synthesis in the presence of liposomes will be a useful method for preparation of variety type of mps.
