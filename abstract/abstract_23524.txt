BACKGROUND
very little is known about neonatal skeletal development in small-sized purebred dogs. in order to improve this knowledge,  <dig> spontaneously dead puppies belonging to small-sized breeds were enrolled in this study for radiologic, histological and morphometric investigations.


RESULTS
the appearance of the limb secondary ossification centers and the onset of their formation were clearly observed by x rays and confirmed by histological evidences. radiographic and anatomic measurements of limb bones length and skull length and width were positively correlated with body weight and age of the subjects and the body weight was positively correlated with radius bone mineral density, as demonstrated by dual-energy x-rays absorptiometry.


CONCLUSIONS
these data provided original information on the growth of newborn small-sized breed dogs, and suggest that cadavers may be useful to study skeletal development.
