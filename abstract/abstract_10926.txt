BACKGROUND
in human pancreatic cancer progression, the α6β1-integrin is expressed on cancer cell surface during invasion and metastasis formation. in this study, we investigated whether interleukin -1α induces the alterations of integrin subunits and urokinase plasminogen activator/urokinase plasminogen activator receptor  expression in pancreatic cancer cells. we hypothesize that the alterations of integrin subunits and upa/upar expression make an important role in signaling pathways responsible for biological behavior of pancreatic cancer cells.


RESULTS
il-1α upregulated the expression of α <dig> and β <dig> integrins without any alterations of α <dig> and αv integrins expression. il-1α also induced enhancement in the expression of upa/upar in pancreatic cancer cells. il-1α enhanced the proliferation, adhesion, and migration in pancreatic cancer cells, and il-1α-induced alterations of upa/upar expression correlated with the increased the migration of pancreatic cancer cells. upregulation of α <dig> integrin subunit and upa/upar correlated with the activation of ras and downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase  pathways. il-1α-induced activation of ras and downstream erk can be inhibited by using inhibitory antibodies against α <dig> and β <dig> integrin and upar, consistent with the inhibition of proliferation, adhesion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells. immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a significant association between strong expressions of α <dig> integrin with upar in pancreatic cancer specimens. furthermore, the strong expression of α <dig> integrin and upar was found to be independent prognosticator in pancreatic cancer patients.


CONCLUSIONS
based on these findings, we conclude that il-1α can induce selective upregulation of α6β1-integrin and upa/upar in pancreatic cancer cells and these changes may modulate the aggressive functions of pancreatic cancer.
