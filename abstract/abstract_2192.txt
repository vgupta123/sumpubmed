BACKGROUND
the use of current high-throughput genetic, genomic and post-genomic data leads to the simultaneous evaluation of a large number of statistical hypothesis and, at the same time, to the multiple-testing problem. as an alternative to the too conservative family-wise error-rate , the false discovery rate  has appeared for the last ten years as more appropriate to handle this problem. however one drawback of fdr is related to a given rejection region for the considered statistics, attributing the same value to those that are close to the boundary and those that are not. as a result, the local fdr has been recently proposed to quantify the specific probability for a given null hypothesis to be true.


RESULTS
in this context we present a semi-parametric approach based on kernel estimators which is applied to different high-throughput biological data such as patterns in dna sequences, genes expression and genome-wide association studies.


CONCLUSIONS
the proposed method has the practical advantages, over existing approaches, to consider complex heterogeneities in the alternative hypothesis, to take into account prior information  by allowing a semi-supervised mode, and to deal with truncated distributions such as those obtained in monte-carlo simulations. this method has been implemented and is available through the r package kerfdr via the cran or at .
