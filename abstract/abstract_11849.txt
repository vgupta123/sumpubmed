BACKGROUND
transcription-induced chimerism, a mechanism involving the transcription and intergenic splicing of two consecutive genes, has recently been estimated to account for ~5% of the human transcriptome. despite this prevalence, the regulation and function of these fused transcripts remains largely uncharacterised.


RESULTS
we identified three novel transcription-induced chimeras resulting from the intergenic splicing of a single rna transcript incorporating the two neighbouring 3p <dig>  tumour suppressor locus genes, rbm <dig> and rbm <dig>  which encode the rna binding motif protein  <dig> and rna binding motif protein  <dig>  respectively. each of the three novel chimeric transcripts lacked exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of rbm <dig> and exon  <dig> of rbm <dig>  differences between the transcripts were associated with the presence or absence of exon  <dig>  exon  <dig> and a  <dig> nucleotide  sequence from intron  <dig> of rbm <dig>  all three chimeric transcripts incorporated the canonical splice sites from both genes . differential expression was observed in tumour tissue compared to non-tumour tissue, and amongst tumour types. in breast tumour tissue, chimeric expression was associated with elevated levels of rbm <dig> and rbm <dig> mrna, and increased tumour size. no protein expression was detected by in vitro transcription/translation.


CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that rbm <dig> mrna experiences altered co-transcriptional gene regulation in certain cancers. the results also suggest that rbm6-rbm <dig> transcription-induced chimerism might be a process that is linked to the tumour-associated increased transcriptional activity of the rbm <dig> gene. it appears that none of the transcription-induced chimeras generates a protein product; however, the novel alternative splicing, which affects putative functional domains within exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of rbm <dig>  does suggest that the generation of these chimeric transcripts has functional relevance. finally, the association of chimeric expression with breast tumour size suggests that rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric expression may be a potential tumour differentiation marker.
