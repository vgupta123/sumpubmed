BACKGROUND
sulfate and phosphate are both vital macronutrients required for plant growth and development. despite evidence for interaction between sulfate and phosphate homeostasis, no transcriptional factor has yet been identified in higher plants that affects, at the gene expression and physiological levels, the response to both elements. this work was aimed at examining whether phr <dig>  a transcription factor previously shown to participate in the regulation of genes involved in phosphate homeostasis, also contributed to the regulation and activity of genes involved in sulfate inter-organ transport.


RESULTS
among the genes implicated in sulfate transport in arabidopsis thaliana, sultr1; <dig> and sultr3; <dig> showed up-regulation of transcripts in plants grown under phosphate-deficient conditions. the promoter of sultr1; <dig> contains a motif that is potentially recognizable by phr <dig>  using the phr <dig> mutant, we showed that sultr1; <dig> up-regulation following phosphate deficiency was dependent on phr <dig>  furthermore, transcript up-regulation was found in phosphate-deficient shoots of the phr <dig> mutant for sultr2; <dig> and sultr3; <dig>  indicating that phr <dig> played both a positive and negative role on the expression of genes encoding sulfate transporters. importantly, both phr <dig> and sultr1; <dig> mutants displayed a reduction in their sulfate shoot-to-root transfer capacity compared to wild-type plants under phosphate-deficient conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
this study reveals that phr <dig> plays an important role in sulfate inter-organ transport, in particular on the regulation of the sultr1; <dig> gene and its impact on shoot-to-root sulfate transport in phosphate-deficient plants. phr <dig> thus contributes to the homeostasis of both sulfate and phosphate in plants under phosphate deficiency. such a function is also conserved in chlamydomonas reinhardtii via the phr <dig> ortholog psr <dig>
