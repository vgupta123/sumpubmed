BACKGROUND
the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the ionic product  of bg60s on osteoblastic activity. the following media groups were created: dmem, which is formed by osteoblasts in basal medium; ip dmem, which is formed by osteoblasts in ip with basal medium; ost, which is formed by osteoblasts in osteogenic medium; and ip ost, which is formed by osteoblasts in ip with osteogenic medium. the osteoblasts were cultivated in an incubator at 37 °c and 5 % co <dig> for  <dig>   <dig> and 21 days. after each period, the alkaline phosphatase  activity, mineralised area per field and expression of osterix , bone sialoprotein , osteonectin  and osteocalcin  were evaluated by reverse transcription -pcr.


RESULTS
the ip significantly increased the ap activity in the ip dmem group at  <dig> and 14 days and reduced the ap activity in the ip ost group at  <dig> and 21 days relative to their respective controls . the groups that received the ip displayed a significant increase in the percentage of mineralised area per field and more advance maturation of the extracellular matrix relative to those that did not receive ip. the ip significantly increased the expression of osx, bsp and on in osteoblast cultures maintained in ip dmem compared with the control  for the majority of studied periods. in osteogenic medium, ip also significantly increased osx, bsp, on and oc expression compared with the control  for the majority of studied periods.


CONCLUSIONS
the ip of bg60s alters the gene expression of canine osteoblasts, favouring the synthesis and mineralisation of the extracellular matrix.
