BACKGROUND
the acute sensitivity of some hybridoma cell lines to culture-related stresses severely limits their productivity. recent developments in the characterization of the stress signals modulating the cellular phenotype revealed that the pro-apoptotic transcription factor gadd <dig> could be used as a marker to facilitate the optimization of mammalian cell cultures. in this report, we analyzed the expression of gadd <dig> in sp2/0-ag <dig> murine hybridoma cells grown in stationary batch culture and subjected to two different culture optimization paradigms: l-glutamine supplementation and ectopic expression of bcl-xl, an anti-apoptotic gene.


RESULTS
the expression of gadd <dig> was found to increase in sp2/0-ag <dig> cells in a manner which coincided with the decline in cell viability. l-glutamine supplementation prolonged sp2/0-ag <dig> cell survival and greatly suppressed gadd <dig> expression both at the mrna and protein level. however, gadd <dig> levels remained low after l-glutamine supplementation even as cell viability declined. bcl-xl overexpression also extended sp2/0-ag <dig> cell viability, initially delayed the induction of gadd <dig>  but did not prevent the increase in gadd <dig> protein levels during the later phase of the culture, when cell viability was declining. interestingly, l-glutamine supplementation prevented gadd <dig> up-regulation in cells ectopically expressing bcl-xl, but had no effect on cell viability.


CONCLUSIONS
this study highlights important limitations to the use of gadd <dig> as an indicator of cell stress in hybridoma cells.
