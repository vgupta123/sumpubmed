BACKGROUND
transforming growth factor-betas , including beta <dig> , constitute a superfamily of multifunctional cytokines with important implications in morphogenesis, cell differentiation and tissue remodeling. tgf-β <dig> is thought to play important roles in multiple developmental processes and neuron survival. however, before we carried out these investigations, a tgf-β <dig> gene down-regulated transgenic animal model was needed. in the present study, expressional silencing tgf-β <dig> was achieved by select predesigning interference short hairpin rnas  targeting mouse tgf-β <dig> genes.


RESULTS
four homozygous transgenic offspring were generated by genetic manipulation and the protein expressions of tgf-β <dig> were detected in different tissues of these mice. the transgenic mice were designated as founder  <dig>  founder  <dig>  founder  <dig> and founder  <dig>  the rates of tgf-β <dig> down-expression in different transgenic mice were evaluated. the present study showed that different tgf-β <dig> expressions were detected in multiple tissues and protein levels of tgf-β <dig> decreased at different rates relative to that of wild type mice. the expressions of tgf-β <dig> proteins in transgenic mice  reduced most by 52%.


CONCLUSIONS
the present study generated transgenic mice with tgf-β <dig> down-regulated, which established mice model for systemic exploring the possible roles of tgf-β <dig> in vivo in different pathology conditions.
