BACKGROUND
solely in europoe, salmonella typhimurium causes more than  <dig>  infections per year. improved detection of livestock colonised with s. typhimurium is necessary to prevent foodborne diseases. currently, commercially available elisa assays are based on a mixture of o-antigens  or total cell lysate of salmonella and are hampered by cross-reaction. the identification of novel immunogenic proteins would be useful to develop elisa based diagnostic assays with a higher specificity.


RESULTS
a phage display library of the entire salmonella typhimurium genome was constructed and  <dig> immunogenic oligopeptides were identified using a pool of convalescent sera from pigs infected with salmonella typhimurium. the corresponding complete genes of seven of the identified oligopeptids were cloned. five of them were produced in e. coli. the immunogenic character of these antigens was validated with sera from pigs infeced with s. tyhimurium and control sera from non-infected animals. finally, human antibody fragments  against these five antigens were selected using antibody phage display and characterised.


CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we identified novel immunogenic proteins of salmonella typhimurium and generated antibody fragments against these antigens completely based on phage display. five immunogenic proteins were validated using a panel of positive and negative sera for prospective applications in diagnostics of salmonela typhimurium.
