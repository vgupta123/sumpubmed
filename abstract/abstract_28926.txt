BACKGROUND
curcumin , an active polyphenol derived from the spice turmeric, has been traditionally used for centuries in ancient indian medicine to treat a number of diseases. the physiological effects of cur have been shown to be diverse; however, the target molecules and pathways that cur affects have yet to be fully described.


RESULTS
here, we demonstrate for the first time that the budding yeast mitogen-activated protein kinase  hog <dig> is essential for the response to cur. moreover, cur-induced hog <dig> phosphorylation was rescued by supplementation of iron to the growth medium. hog <dig> was rapidly phosphorylated upon cur treatment, but unlike the response to hyperosmotic shock , it remains activated for an extended period of time. a detailed analysis of hog pathway mutants revealed that pbs2p, ptc2p, and ssk2p are required for optimal cur-induced hog <dig> phosphorylation. we also observed a hog <dig> dependent transcriptional response to cur treatment that involved the up-regulation of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  <dig> , a factor that is essential for the hyperosmotic stress response.


CONCLUSIONS
our present finding revealed the role of hog <dig> mapk in regulation of cur-induced transcriptional response. we anticipate that our finding will enhance the understanding on the molecular mode of action of cur on s. cerevisiae.
