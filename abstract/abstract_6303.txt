BACKGROUND
micrornas  are known to regulate various biological processes, including expression of cellular gene and virus-induced inflammation. recently, studies have indicated that some mirnas could regulate influenza virus replication. due to differential sensitivities of influenza a virus strains to different species , variations in host responses may be observed. therefore, we investigated and compared the differences in global host mirna expression in mouse lungs infected with wild type low pathogenicity a/aquatic bird/korea/w81/ <dig>   or mouse-adapted virulent a/aquatic bird /korea/ma81/ <dig>   virus.


RESULTS
although the mice infected with ma <dig> exhibited much greater mortality than w81-infected mice, the parental w <dig> virus induced a higher number of differentially expressed mirnas compared to the ma <dig> virus. between these  <dig> viruses, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were commonly expressed at  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi, respectively. it is noteworthy that only  <dig> mirnas  were significantly upregulated in both lungs infected with either wild type w <dig> or the mouse-adapted ma <dig> strain at both time points. notably, expression levels of mir-147-3p, mir-151-5p, mir-155-3p, and mir-223-3p were higher in the lungs of mice infected with the ma <dig> virus than those infected with the w <dig> virus. to identify potential roles of these mirnas in regulating influenza virus replication, each group of mice was intranasally treated with each inhibitor of specifically targeting  <dig> mirnas, and then challenged with  <dig> mouse lethal dose 50%  of the virulent ma <dig> virus on the following day. although the specific mirna inhibitors could not completely attenuate mortality or reduce viral replication, the mir-151-5p- and mir-223-3p-inhibitors reduced mortality of inoculated mice to 70% and substantially delayed death.


CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that the mammalian adaptation of avian influenza a virus results in a different mirna expression pattern in lungs of virus-infected mice compared with its parental strain, and use of specific mirna inhibitors to target genes associated with the immune response or cell death may affect virulence and virus replication.
