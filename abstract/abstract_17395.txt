BACKGROUND
recent studies have demonstrated a selection pressure for reduced mrna secondary-structure stability near the start codon of coding sequences. this selection pressure can be observed in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, and is likely caused by the requirement of efficient translation initiation in cellular organism.


RESULTS
here, we surveyed the complete genomes of  <dig> dsdna virus strains for signals of reduced stability of mrna secondary structure near the start codon. our analysis included viruses infecting eukaryotic, prokaryotic, and archaeic hosts. we found that many viruses showed evidence for reduced mrna secondary-structure stability near the start codon. the effect was most pronounced in viruses infecting prokaryotes, but was also observed in viruses infecting eukaryotes and archaea. the reduction in stability generally increased with increasing genomic gc content. for bacteriophage, the reduction was correlated with a corresponding reduction of stability in the phage hosts.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that reduced stability of the mrna secondary structure near the start codon is a common feature for dsdna viruses, likely driven by the same selective pressures that cause it in cellular organisms.
