BACKGROUND
in former studies we showed in a rat model of renal transplantation that mesenchymal stromal cells  prevent acute rejection in an independent way of their endowing in the graft. in this study we investigated whether msc operate by resetting cytokine network and scatter factor systems, i.e. hepatocyte growth factor , macrophage stimulating protein  and their receptors met and ron, respectively.

methods
msc were injected into the renal artery soon after reperfusion. controls were grafted untreated and normal rats. rats were sacrificed 7 days after grafting. serum and renal tissue levels of ifn-γ, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  msp/ron, hgf/met systems, treg lymphocytes were investigated.


RESULTS
in grafted untreated rats ifn-γ increased in serum and renal tissue and il- <dig> rose in serum. msc prevented both the phenomena, increased il- <dig> serum levels and treg number in the graft. furthermore msc increased serum and tissue hgf levels, met tubular expression and prevented the suppression of tubular msp/ron expression.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that msc modify cytokine network to a tolerogenic setting, they suppress th <dig> cells, inactivate monocytes/macrophage, recruit tregs. in addition, msc sustain the expression of the scatter factor systems expression, i.e. systems that are committed to defend survival and stimulate regeneration of tubular cells.
