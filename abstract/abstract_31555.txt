BACKGROUND
retinal degeneration is a main cause of blindness in humans. neuroprotective therapies may be used to rescue retinal cells and preserve vision. hypoxic preconditioning stabilizes the transcription factor hif-1Î± in the retina and strongly protects photoreceptors in an animal model of light-induced retinal degeneration. to address the molecular mechanisms of the protection, we analyzed the transcriptome of the hypoxic retina using microarrays and real-time pcr.


RESULTS
hypoxic exposure induced a marked alteration in the retinal transcriptome with significantly different expression levels of  <dig> genes immediately after hypoxic exposure. the normal expression profile was restored within  <dig> hours of reoxygenation. among the differentially regulated genes, several candidates for neuroprotection were identified like metallothionein- <dig> and - <dig>  the hif- <dig> target gene adrenomedullin and the gene encoding the antioxidative and cytoprotective enzyme paraoxonase  <dig> which was previously not known to be a hypoxia responsive gene in the retina. the strongly upregulated cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p <dig> was excluded from being essential for neuroprotection.


CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that neuroprotection after hypoxic preconditioning is the result of the differential expression of a multitude of genes which may act in concert to protect visual cells against a toxic insult.
