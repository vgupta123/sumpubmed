BACKGROUND
the myb family is one of the most abundant transcription factor families in plants. myb proteins are involved in plant development, abiotic stress tolerance, hormone signal transduction and disease resistance. here we perform genome-wide identification of myb family transcription factors in an energy plant j. curcas, including determining family composition, phylogenetic evolution and functional prediction analysis. in addition, we further elucidate the function of the jcmyb <dig> gene.

methods
the phylogenetic trees were constructed by using the neighbor-joining method in mega  <dig> . the biological functions of some jcmybs were predicted according to orthology. the full length cdna of jcmyb <dig> was cloned by using the race method. gus histochemical staining was used to test the activity of the jcmyb <dig> promoter. expression patterns of jcmyb <dig> were detected by using qpcr transcriptional activity jcmyb <dig> were confirmed through yeast one hybrid. subcellular localization of jcmyb <dig> protein were demonstrated by transient expression in the tobacco leaf. the function of jcmyb <dig> in salt and freezing tolerance were detected in transgenic plants.


RESULTS
a genome-wide analysis identified  <dig> myb genes, including  <dig> r2r3-mybs,  <dig> r1r2r3-mybs and  <dig> 4r-myb. all of the r2r3-mybs are further classified into  <dig> groups which indicated functional conservation among previously identified groups of r2r3-myb proteins. among of these newly identified mybs, the jcmyb <dig> belongs to group g <dig> and its expression is induced obviously by cold, salt and meja  and slightly by aba . jcmyb <dig> is localized to the nucleus and has transcriptional activity. jcmyb <dig> overexpressing plants are more tolerant to salt and cold stress than wild type plants. tissue specific expression profiles showed that the jcmyb <dig> gene was expressed ubiquitously throughout the plant, with higher expression levels observed in the root.


CONCLUSIONS
a comprehensive genome-wide analysis and phylogenetic relationship of r2r3-myb subfamily in j. curcas present the global identification and functional prediction of jcr2r3-mybs. additionally, jcmyb <dig> regulates the stress response signaling networks by interacting with meja and aba signaling pathway and functions in the root development of j. curcas.
