BACKGROUND
the complete degradation of the cellulose requires the synergistic action of endo-β-glucanase, exo-β-glucanase, and β-glucosidase. but endo-β-glucanase and exo-β-glucanase can be recovered by solid–liquid separation in cellulose hydrolysis by their cellulose binding domain , however, the β-glucosidases cannot be recovered because of most β-glucosidases without the cbd, so additional β-glucosidases are necessary for the next cellulose degradation. this will increase the cost of cellulose degradation.


RESULTS
the glucose-tolerant β-glucosidase  from thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum dsm  <dig> was fused with cellulose binding domain  of clostridium cellulovorans cellulosome anchoring protein by a peptide linker. the fusion enzyme  gene was overexpressed in escherichia coli with the maximum β-glucosidase activity of  <dig> u/ml. recombinant bgl-cbd was purified by heat treatment and following by ni-nta affinity. the enzymatic characteristics of the bgl-cbd showed optimal activities at ph  <dig>  and 65°c. the fusion of cbd structure enhanced the hydrolytic efficiency of the bgl-cbd against cellobiose, which displayed a 6-fold increase in v

 in comparison with the bgl. a gram of cellulose was found to absorb  <dig> u of the fusion enzyme  in ph  <dig>  at 50°c for 25 min with a high immobilization efficiency of 90%. using the bgl-cbd as the catalyst, the yield of glucose reached a maximum of 90% from 100 g/l cellobiose and the bgl-cbd could retain over 85% activity after five batches with the yield of glucose all above 70%. the performance of the bgl-cbd on microcrystalline cellulose was also studied. the yield of the glucose was increased from 47% to 58% by adding the bgl-cbd to the cellulase, instead of adding the novozyme  <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
the hydrolytic activity of bgl-cbd is greater than that of the novozyme  <dig> in cellulose degradation. the article provides a prospect to decrease significantly the operational cost of the hydrolysis process.
