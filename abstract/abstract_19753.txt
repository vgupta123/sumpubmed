BACKGROUND
it is well documented that the nitric oxide  might be directly involved in brain response to hypobaric hypoxia, and could contribute to memory deficiencies. recent studies have shown that melatonin could attenuate hypoxia or ischemia-induced nerve injuries by decreasing the production of free radicals. the present study, using immunohistochemical and immunoblot methods, aimed to explore whether melatonin treatment may affect the expression of nitric oxide system and protein nitration, and provide neuroprotection in the rat hippocampus injured by hypobaric hypoxia. prior to hypoxic treatment, adult rats were pretreated with melatonin  before they were exposed to the altitude chamber with 48 torr of the partial oxygen concentration  for 7 h to mimic the ambience of being at 9000 m in height. they were then sacrificed after 0 h,  <dig>  and 3 days of reoxygenation.


RESULTS
the results obtained from the immunohistochemical and immunoblotting analyses showed that the expressions of neuronal nitric oxide synthase , endothelial nitric oxide synthase , inducible nitric oxide synthase , nitrotyrosine  and caspase  <dig> in the hypoxic hippocampus were increased from 0 h to 3 days of reoxygenation. interestingly, the hypoxia-induced increase of nnos, enos, inos, ntyr and caspase  <dig> protein expression was significantly depressed in the hypoxic rats treated with melatonin.


CONCLUSIONS
activation of the nitric oxide system and protein nitration constitutes a hippocampal response to hypobaric hypoxia and administration of melatonin could provide new therapeutic avenues to prevent and/or treat the symptoms produced by hypobaric hypoxia.
