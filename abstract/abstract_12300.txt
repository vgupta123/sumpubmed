BACKGROUND
although dna vaccine holds a great potential for cancer immunotherapy, effective long-lasting antitumoral immunity sufficient to induce durable responses in cancer patients remains to be achieved. considering the pivotal role of dendritic cells  in the antigen processing and presentation, we prepared dc-targeting dna vaccines by fusing tumor-associated antigen her2/neu ectodomain to single chain antibody fragment  from nldc- <dig> antibody specific for dc-restricted surface molecule dec- <dig> , and explored its antitumoral efficacy and underlying mechanisms in mouse breast cancer models.


RESULTS
in vivo targeting assay demonstrated that scfvnldc- <dig> specifically delivered dna vaccine-encoded antigen to dc. compared with untargeted her2/neu dna vaccines, vaccination with scfvnldc-145-her2/neu markedly promoted the her2/neu-specific cellular and humoral immune responses with long-lasting immune memory, resulting in effective protection against challenge of her2/neu-positive d2f2/e <dig> breast tumor while ineffective in parental her2/neu-negative d2f <dig> breast tumor. more importantly, in combination with temporary depletion of regulatory t cells  by low-dose cyclophosphamide, vaccination with scfvnldc-145-her2/neu induced the regression of established d2f2/e <dig> breast tumor and significantly retarded the development of spontaneous mammary carcinomas in transgenic balb-neut mice.


CONCLUSIONS
our findings demonstrate that dc-targeted dna vaccines for in vivo direct delivery of tumor antigens to dc could induce potent antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses and, if additional combination with systemic treg depletion, was able to elicit an impressively therapeutic antitumoral activity, providing a rationale for further development of this approach for cancer treatment.
