BACKGROUND
studies have suggested that demographic and lifestyle factors could shape the composition of fecal microbiota in early life. this study evaluated infant stool microbiota signatures in two asian populations, singapore  and indonesia  with contrasting socioeconomic development, and examined the putative influences of demographic factors on these human fecal associated bacterial signatures.


RESULTS
longitudinal analysis showed associations of geographical origin with clostridium leptum, atopobium and bifidobacterium groups. mode of delivery had the largest effect on stool microbiota signatures influencing the abundance of four bacterial groups. significantly higher abundance of bacterial members belonging to the bacteroides-prevotella, bifidobacterium and atopobium groups, but lower abundance of lactobacilli-enterococci group members, were observed in vaginal delivered compared to caesarean delivered infants. demographic factors influencing the structure of infants stool microbiota during the first year of life included breastfeeding, age of weaning, sibship size and exposure to antibiotics.


CONCLUSIONS
differences in stool microbiota signatures were observed in relation to various demographic factors. these features may confound studies relating to the association of the structure of fecal microbiota and the predisposition to human modern disease.
