BACKGROUND
g protein coupled receptors  represent the largest family of membrane proteins in the human genome and the richest source of targets for the pharmaceutical industry. a major limitation to characterizing gpcrs has been the difficulty in developing high-level heterologous expression systems that are cost effective. reasons for these difficulties include inefficient transport and insertion in the plasma membrane and cytotoxicity. additionally, gpcr purification requires detergents, which have a negative effect on receptor yields and stability.


RESULTS
here we report a detergent-free cell-free protein expression-based method to obtain pharmacologically active gpcrs in about  <dig> hours. our strategy relies on the co-translational insertion of modified gpcrs into nanometer-sized planar membranes. as a model we employed an engineered β2-adrenergic receptor in which the third intracellular loop has been replaced with t <dig> lysozyme . we demonstrated that nanolipoprotein particles  are necessary for expression of active β2ar -t4l in cell-free systems. the binding specificity of the nlp- β2ar-t4l complex has been determined by competitive assays. our results demonstrate that β2ar-t4l synthesized in vitro depends on similar oxidative conditions as those required by an in vivo-expressed receptor.


CONCLUSIONS
although the activation of β2ar-t4l requires the insertion of the t <dig> lysozyme sequence and the yield of that active protein limited, our results conceptually prove that cell-free protein expression could be used as a fast approach to express these valuable and notoriously difficult-to-express proteins.
