BACKGROUND
the link between reproductive life history and incidence of ovarian tumors is well known. periods of reduced ovulations may confer protection against ovarian cancer. using phenotypic data available for mouse, a possible association between the ovarian transcriptome, reproductive records and spontaneous ovarian tumor rates was investigated in four mouse inbred strains. nia15k-dna microarrays were employed to obtain expression profiles of balbc, c57bl <dig>  fvb and swr adult ovaries.


RESULTS
linear regression analysis with multiple-test control  resulted in ovarian tumor frequency  and number of litters  as the top-correlated among five tested phenotypes. moreover, nearly one-hundred genes were coincident between these two traits and were decomposed in  <dig> otf nl and  <dig> otf nl genes, where the plus/minus signs indicate the direction of correlation. enriched functional categories were rna-binding/mrna-processing and protein folding in the otf nl and the otf nl subsets, respectively. in contrast, no associations were detected between otf and litter size , the latter a measure of ovulation events in a single estrous cycle.


CONCLUSIONS
literature text-mining pointed to post-transcriptional control of ovarian processes including oocyte maturation, folliculogenesis and angiogenesis as possible causal relationships of observed tumor and reproductive phenotypes. we speculate that repetitive cycling instead of repetitive ovulations represent the actual link between ovarian tumorigenesis and reproductive records.
