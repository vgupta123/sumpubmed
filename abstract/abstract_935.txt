BACKGROUND
computational comparison of two protein structures is the starting point of many methods that build on existing knowledge, such as structure modeling , molecular replacement, or annotation by structural similarity. in a commonly used strategy, significant effort is invested in matching two sets of atoms. in a complementary approach, a global descriptor is assigned to the overall structure, thus losing track of the substructures within.


RESULTS
using a small set of geometric features, we define a reduced representation of protein structure, together with an optimizing function for matching two representations, to provide a pre-filtering stage in a database search. we show that, in a straightforward implementation, the representation performs well in terms of resolution in the space of protein structures, and its ability to make new predictions.


CONCLUSIONS
perhaps unexpectedly, a substantial discriminating power already exists at the level of main features of protein structure, such as directions of secondary structural elements, possibly constrained by their sequential order. this can be used toward efficient comparison of protein structures, allowing for various degrees of conformational flexibility within the compared pair, which in turn can be used for modeling by homology of protein structure and dynamics.
