BACKGROUND
for a proper understanding of protein structure and folding it is important to know if a polypeptide segment adopts a conformation inherent in the sequence or it depends on the context of its flanking secondary structures. turns of various lengths have been studied and characterized starting from three-residue γ-turn to six-residue π-turn. the schellman motif occurring at the c-terminal end of α-helices is a classical example of hydrogen bonded π-turn involving residues at  and  positions. hydrogen bonded and non-hydrogen bonded β- and α-turns have been identified previously; likewise, a systematic characterization of π-turns would provide valuable insight into turn structures.


RESULTS
an analysis of protein structures indicates that at least 20% of π-turns occur independent of the schellman motif. the two categories of π-turns, designated as π-hb and sch, have been further classified on the basis of backbone conformation and both have aaaa as the major class. they differ in the residue usage at position , the former having a large preference for pro that is absent in the latter. as in the case of shorter length β- and α-turns, π-turns have also been identified not only on the basis of the existence of hydrogen bond, but also using the distance between terminal cα-atoms, and this resulted in a comparable number of non-hydrogen-bonded π-turns . the presence of shorter β- and α-turns within all categories of π-turns, the subtle variations in backbone torsion angles along the turn residues, the location of the turns in the context of tertiary structures have been studied.


CONCLUSIONS
π-turns have been characterized, first using hydrogen bond and the distance between cα atoms of the terminal residues, and then using backbone torsion angles. while the schellman motif has a structural role in helix termination, many of the π-hb turns, being located on surface cavities, have functional role and there is also sequence conservation.
