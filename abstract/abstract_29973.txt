BACKGROUND
gene flow and adaptive divergence are key aspects of metapopulation dynamics and ecological speciation. long-distance dispersal is hard to detect and few studies estimate dispersal in combination with adaptive divergence. the aim of this study was to investigate effective long-distance dispersal and adaptive divergence in the fen orchid  rich.). we used amplified fragment length polymorphism -based assignment tests to quantify effective long-distance dispersal at two different regions in northwest europe. in addition, genomic divergence between fen orchid populations occupying two distinguishable habitats, wet dune slacks and alkaline fens, was investigated by a genome scan approach at different spatial scales  and based on  <dig> aflp loci.


RESULTS
we expected that different habitats would contribute to strong divergence and restricted gene flow resulting in isolation-by-adaptation. instead, we found remarkably high levels of effective long-distance seed dispersal and low levels of adaptive divergence. at least 15% of the assigned individuals likely originated from among-population dispersal events with dispersal distances up to 220 km. six  ‘outlier’ loci, potentially reflecting local adaptation to habitat-type, were identified with high statistical support. of these, only one  was a replicated outlier in multiple independent dune-fen population comparisons and thus possibly reflecting truly parallel divergence. signals of adaptation in response to habitat type were most evident at the scale of individual populations.


CONCLUSIONS
the findings of this study suggest that the homogenizing effect of effective long-distance seed dispersal may overwhelm divergent selection associated to habitat type in fen orchids in northwest europe.
