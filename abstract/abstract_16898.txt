BACKGROUND
bovine herpesvirus  <dig>  is a gammaherpesvirus whose genome was cloned as bacterial artificial chromosome  and exploited as a gene delivery vector for vaccine purposes. although bohv- <dig> genome has been completely sequenced and its open reading frames  structurally defined in silico, most of them are not functionally characterized. in bohv- <dig> genome two major immediate early genes  are present, ie <dig> and ie <dig>  ie <dig> is an essential gene because its removal from the viral genome renders the virus unable to replicate, whereas for ie <dig> no many functional information are available.


RESULTS
in this work, ie <dig> contribution in initiating and maintaining bohv- <dig> lytic replication was assessed generating a recombinant bohv- <dig> genome lacking of ie <dig> gene, bohv-4Δie <dig>  in contrast to bohv-4ie <dig> deleted mutant, bohv-4Δie <dig> infectious replicating viral particles  could be reconstituted following viral dna electroporation in permissive cells. however the titer of bohv-4Δie <dig> irvps produced into the cell supernatant and bohv-4Δie <dig> plaques size were reduced respect to bohv- <dig> undeleted control. further the impaired bohv-4Δie <dig> irvps produced into the cell supernatant could be rescued by expressing ie <dig> gene product in trans, confirming the implication of ie <dig> in bohv- <dig> lytic replication. next, the possible role of bohv-4ie <dig> as bone marrow stromal cell antigen  <dig>  counteracting factor, as hypothesized by ie <dig> amino-terminal gene product homology with kaposi sarcoma associated herpesvirus  k <dig>  was excluded too.


CONCLUSIONS
although the real function of bohv-4ie <dig> is still elusive, a new bohv- <dig> genome gene locus as a target site for the insertion of foreign dna and resulting in the attenuation of the virus has been revealed. these data can be considered of relevance to improve bohv- <dig> gene delivery properties.
