BACKGROUND
previous study has demonstrated that dietary taurine supplement protected rats from impairments of synaptic plasticity induced by postnatal lead exposure. however, little is known about the role of taurine in the presence of prenatal and perinatal lead exposure. we investigated the possible effect of taurine supplement on prenatal and perinatal lead-induced synaptic plasticity deficit and determined developmental periods critical for the effect of taurine.


RESULTS
in the present study, taurine was administrated to prenatal and perinatal lead-exposed rats in different developmental periods: from prenatal to weaning , from weaning to life , and from prenatal to life . we examined the input-output  function, paired-pulse facilitation  and the long-term potentiation  of field excitatory postsynaptic potential  in the hippocampal ca <dig> area of rats on postnatal days 18– <dig>  or days 60– <dig> . we found that  on p18– <dig>  taurine had no evident effect on i/o functions and ppf ratios of lead-exposed rats but caused a  <dig> % increase in the ltp amplitudes of these animals;  on p60– <dig>  taurine significantly elevated lead depressed i/o functions and ppf ratios in lead+pw-tau and lead+pl-tau rats, but failed in lead+wl-tau rats. the amplitudes of ltp of lead-exposed rats were all significantly increased by additional taurine supplement in any developmental period compared with untreated rats. thus, taurine appeared to have the most effect during the prenatal and lactation periods and its effects on younger rats would not be manifest until the adult life; and  the level of lead deposition in hippocampus was evidently reduced by additional treatment of taurine in lead-exposed rats, compared with untreated rats.


CONCLUSIONS
taurine supplement can protect the adult rats from synaptic plasticity deficits following prenatal and perinatal lead exposure, and the protective effects are critical for the prenatal and lactation periods of lead-exposed rats.
