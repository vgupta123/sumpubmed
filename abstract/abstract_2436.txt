BACKGROUND
microrna- <dig>  is the diced product of the mir155hg gene. mir- <dig> regulates the expression of many immune-specific transcripts, is overexpressed in many human lymphomas, and has oncogenic activity in mouse transgenic models. mir155hg has been proposed to be a target gene for transcription factor nf-κb largely due to the positive correlation between high nuclear nf-κb activity and increased mir- <dig> expression following treatment with nf-κb inducers or in subsets of hematopoietic cancers. nevertheless, direct regulation of the human mir155hg promoter by nf-κb has not been convincingly demonstrated previously.


RESULTS
this report shows that induction of nf-κb activity rapidly leads to increased levels of both primary mir155hg mrna and mature mir- <dig> transcripts. we have mapped an nf-κb-responsive element to a position approximately  <dig> nt upstream of the mir155hg transcription start site. the - <dig> site is specifically bound by the nf-κb p50/p <dig> heterodimer and is required for p65-induced reporter gene activation. moreover, the levels of mir- <dig> in nine human b-lymphoma cell lines generally correlate with increased nuclear nf-κb proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, the identification of an nf-κb-responsive site in the mir155hg proximal promoter suggests that mir155hg is a direct nf-κb target gene in vivo. understanding nf-κb-mediated regulation of mir- <dig> could lead to improved immune cell-related diagnostic tools and targeted therapies.
