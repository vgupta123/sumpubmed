BACKGROUND
this study aimed to test the hypothesis that immune dysfunction and the increased risk of spontaneous abortion in pregnant women with hyperandrogenia  are caused by the reduced tolerogenic potential of dendritic cells  that results from elevated levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate .

methods
the phenotypic and functional properties of monocyte-derived dcs generated from blood monocytes from non-pregnant women, women with a normal pregnancy, or pregnant women with ha, as well as the in vitro effects of dheas on dcs in healthy pregnant women were investigated.


RESULTS
in a normal pregnancy, dcs were shown to be immature and are characterized by a reduced number of cd83+ and cd25+ dcs, the ability to stimulate type  <dig> t cell responses and to induce t cell apoptosis. by contrast, dcs from pregnant women with ha had a mature phenotype, were able to stimulate both type  <dig>  and type  <dig>  t cell responses, and were characterized by lower b7-h <dig> expression and cytotoxic activity against cd8+ t cells. the addition of dheas to cultures of dcs from healthy pregnant women induced the maturation of dcs and increased their ability to activate type  <dig> t cell responses.


CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrated the reduction in the tolerogenic potential of dcs from pregnant women with ha, and revealed new mechanisms involved in the hormonal regulation of dcs mediated by dheas.
