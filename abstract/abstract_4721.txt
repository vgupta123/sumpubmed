BACKGROUND
leaf-cutting  ants use their own fecal material to manure fungus gardens, which consist of leaf material overgrown by hyphal threads of the basidiomycete fungus leucocoprinus gongylophorus that lives in symbiosis with the ants. previous studies have suggested that the fecal droplets contain proteins that are produced by the fungal symbiont to pass unharmed through the digestive system of the ants, so they can enhance new fungus garden growth.


RESULTS
we tested this hypothesis by using proteomics methods to determine the gene sequences of fecal proteins in acromyrmex echinatior leaf-cutting ants. seven  of the  <dig> identified proteins were pectinolytic enzymes that originated from the fungal symbiont and which were still active in the fecal droplets produced by the ants. we show that these enzymes are found in the fecal material only when the ants had access to fungus garden food, and we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis to show that the expression of six of these enzyme genes was substantially upregulated in the fungal gongylidia. these unique structures serve as food for the ants and are produced only by the evolutionarily advanced garden symbionts of higher attine ants, but not by the fungi reared by the basal lineages of this ant clade.


CONCLUSIONS
pectinolytic enzymes produced in the gongylidia of the fungal symbiont are ingested but not digested by acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants so that they end up in the fecal fluid and become mixed with new garden substrate. substantial quantities of pectinolytic enzymes are typically found in pathogenic fungi that attack live plant tissue, where they are known to breach the cell walls to allow the fungal mycelium access to the cell contents. as the leaf-cutting ant symbionts are derived from fungal clades that decompose dead plant material, our results suggest that their pectinolytic enzymes represent secondarily evolved adaptations that are convergent to those normally found in phytopathogens.
