BACKGROUND
hybridization differences caused by target sequence differences can be a confounding factor in analyzing gene expression on microarrays, lead to false positives and reduce power to detect real expression differences. we prepared an r bioconductor compatible package to detect, characterize and remove such probes in affymetrix 3â€™ivt and exon-based arrays on the basis of correlation of signal intensities from probes within probe sets.


RESULTS
using completely mouse genomes we determined type  <dig>  and type  <dig>  errors with high accuracy and we show that our method routinely outperforms previous methods. when detecting  <dig> % of known snp/indels in mouse expression data, we obtain at most  <dig> % false positives. at the same level of false positives, best previous method detected  <dig> %. we also show that probes with differing binding affinity both hinder differential expression detection and introduce artifacts in cancer-healthy tissue comparison.


CONCLUSIONS
detection and removal of such probes should be a routine step in affymetrix data preprocessing. we prepared a user friendly r package, compatible with bioconductor, that allows the filtering and improving of data from affymetrix microarrays experiments.
