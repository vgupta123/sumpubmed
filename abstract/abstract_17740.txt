BACKGROUND
in the setting of liver injury hepatic progenitor cells are activated, counterbalancing the inhibited regenerative capacity of mature hepatocytes. chronic activation of this compartment may give rise to a subset of liver tumours with poor prognosis. serpinb <dig>  a serpin over-expressed in injured liver and in primary liver cancer, has been shown to induce apoptosis resistance, epithelial to mesenchymal transition and to increase tgf-beta and myc expression. aim of the present study was to explore the presence of serpinb <dig> in hepatic progenitor cells in human livers and in a mouse model of liver stem/progenitor cell activation.

hepatic progenitor cells were analysed in foetal and adult livers at protein and transcriptional levels. to induce experimental activation of the liver stem/progenitor compartment, c57bl/6j mice were injected with lipopolysaccharide plus d-galactosamine and were sacrificed at different time points. liver cdna was amplified using specific primers for mouse-homologous serpinb <dig> isoforms and automatically sequenced.


RESULTS
the presence of serpinb <dig> in the progenitor cell compartment was detected in sorted human foetal and adult epithelial cell adhesion molecule  positive liver cells. by immunohistochemistry serpinb <dig> was found in human cirrhotic livers in portal areas with progenitor cell activation showing ductular proliferation. ck- <dig>  ck- <dig>  epcam and cd- <dig> positive cell were also positive for serpinb <dig>  in the animal model, time course analysis in liver specimens revealed a progressive increase of serpinb <dig> and a parallel decrease of activated caspase  <dig>  which was barely detectable at 20Â hours. transcription analysis confirmed the presence of serpinb3-homologous only in the liver of injured mice and sequence analysis proved its belonging to mouse serpinb3b.


CONCLUSIONS
serpinb <dig> is highly expressed in hepatic stem/progenitor cell compartment of both foetal and adult livers.
