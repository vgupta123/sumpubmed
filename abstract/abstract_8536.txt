BACKGROUND
various senses and sensory nerve architectures of animals have evolved during adaptation to exploit diverse environments. in craniates, the trunk sensory system has evolved from simple mechanosensory neurons inside the spinal cord , called rohon-beard  cells, to multimodal sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia  outside the spinal cord . the fish and amphibian trunk sensory systems switch from rb cells to drg during development, while amniotes rely exclusively on the drg system. the mechanisms underlying the ontogenic switching and its link to phylogenetic transition remain unknown.


RESULTS
in xenopus, six <dig> overexpression promoted precocious apoptosis of rb cells and emergence of extramedullary sensory neurons, whereas six <dig> knockdown delayed the reduction in rb cell number. genetic ablation of six <dig> and six <dig> in mice led to the appearance of intramedullary sensory neuron-like cells as a result of medial migration of neural crest cells into the spinal cord and production of immature drg neurons and fused drg. restoration of six <dig> expression in the neural crest-linage partially rescued the phenotype, indicating the cell autonomous requirements of six <dig> for normal extramedullary sensory neurogenesis. mouse six <dig> enhancer that mediates the expression in drg neurons activated transcription in xenopus rb cells earlier than endogenous six <dig> expression, suggesting earlier onset of mouse six <dig> expression than xenopus during sensory development.


CONCLUSIONS
the results indicated the critical role of six <dig> in transition of rb cells to drg neurons during xenopus development and establishment of exclusive drg system of mice. the study provided evidence that early appearance of six <dig> expression, which correlated with mouse six <dig> enhancer, is essential for the formation of drg-dominant system in mice, suggesting that heterochronic changes in six <dig> enhancer sequence play an important role in alteration of trunk sensory architecture and contribute to the evolution of the trunk sensory system.
