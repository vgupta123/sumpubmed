BACKGROUND
zebrafish are increasingly used to study the influences of gene mutation and manipulation on cardiac development, structure and function. in this study, a video edge detection system was used to characterise, continuously, cardiac ventricle function in 2– <dig> days old zebrafish embryos embedded in  <dig> % agar and examined under light microscopy at room temperature . using video edge detection software , the motion of a small region of the cardiac ventricle wall was converted to a continuous chart trace allowing analysis of wall motion amplitude  and myocardial wall velocity during systole  and diastole .


RESULTS
cardiac wall motion characteristics changed progressively from day  <dig> to  <dig> . mwvd was more rapid than mwvs at all developmental time points. embryonic hearts were also assessed after increasing concentrations of norepenephrine  and the anaesthetic agent ms <dig>  were added to the bathing water. in response to ne, wma increased significantly more in  <dig> day embryos compared with  <dig> day embryos  while the decrease in wma in response to ms <dig> was similar in both  <dig> and 4-day embryos. heart rate, mwvs and mwvd were significantly higher at 28°c compared with 22°c. no differences in cardiac function were observed between ab and golden strains.


CONCLUSIONS
video edge detection appears sufficiently sensitive to detect subtle changes in diastolic and systolic cardiac function during development and changes resulting from pharmacological and environmental interventions. such measurements could be valuable in assessment of altered cardiac function after genetic manipulation.
