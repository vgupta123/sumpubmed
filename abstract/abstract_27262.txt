BACKGROUND
the transcription factor dof affecting germination <dig>  is a repressor of seed germination acting downstream of the master repressor phytocrome interacting factor3-like  <dig> . among others, pil <dig> induces the expression of the genes encoding the two della proteins ga insensitive  <dig>  and repressor of ga1- <dig> .


RESULTS
based on the properties of gai-t <dig> and rga <dig> mutant seeds, we show here that the absence of rga severely increases dormancy, while lack of gai only partially compensates rga inactivation. in addition, the germination properties of the dag1rga <dig> double mutant are different from those of the dag <dig> and rga <dig> single mutants, suggesting that rga and dag <dig> act in independent branches of the pil5-controlled germination pathway. surprisingly, the dag1gai-t <dig> double mutant proved embryo-lethal, suggesting an unexpected involvement of  dag <dig> and gai in embryo development.


CONCLUSIONS
rather than overlapping functions as previously suggested, we show that rga and gai play distinct roles in seed germination, and that gai interacts with dag <dig> in embryo development.
