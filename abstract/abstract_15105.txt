BACKGROUND
follistatin  has been shown to bind to some tgf-β family members and can function as a potent myostatin  antagonist. recent studies have revealed that over-expression of fst by adeno-associated viruses increases muscle growth in mice, humans and nonhuman primates. in the present study, to determine the effect of fst on ovine primary myoblast  proliferation, fst was over-expressed using an adeno-associated virus serotype  <dig>  vector.


RESULTS
western blot results showed that aav induced the expression of fst protein in transduced opm cells. real-time quantitative pcr results indicated that over-expression of fst resulted in a dramatic increase in akt i and cdk <dig> expression and a decrease in p <dig> expression. moreover, cell cycle analysis confirmed that fst down-regulated p <dig>  a cdk inhibitor, and increased the level of cdk <dig> expression in opm cells. hence, follistatin positively regulated the g <dig> to s progression. our results showed that fst induced proliferation through a down-regulation of p <dig>  as only the p <dig> expression level was down-regulated as a result of fst over-expression in myoblasts, whereas no change was observed in the level of p <dig> expression.


CONCLUSIONS
these results expanded our understanding of the regulation mechanism of fst in ovine primary myoblasts. our results provide the first evidence that the aav viral system can be used for gene transfer in ovine myoblast cells. moreover, the results showed that an aav vector can successfully induce the expression of fst in opm cells in vitro. these findings demonstrated that fst over-expression induces proliferation through a down-regulation of the p <dig> gene under proliferating conditions.
