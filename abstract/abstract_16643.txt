BACKGROUND
yy <dig> is an epigenetic regulator for a large number of mammalian genes. while performing genome-wide yy <dig> binding motif searches, we discovered that the olfactory receptor  genes have an unusual cluster of yy <dig> binding sites within their coding regions. the statistical significance of this observation was further analyzed.


RESULTS
about 45% of the olfactory genes in the mouse have a range of 4- <dig> yy <dig> binding sites within their respective  <dig> kb coding regions. statistical analyses indicate that this enrichment of yy <dig> motifs has likely been driven by unknown selection pressures at the dna level, but not serendipitously by some peptides enriched within the olfr genes. similar patterns are also detected in the olfr genes of all mammals analyzed, but not in the olfr genes of the fish lineage, suggesting a mammal-specific phenomenon.


CONCLUSIONS
yy <dig>  or yy1-related transcription factors, may help regulate olfactory receptor genes. furthermore, the protein-coding regions of vertebrate genes can contain cis-regulatory elements for transcription factor binding as well as codons.
