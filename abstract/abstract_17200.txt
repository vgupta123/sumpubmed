BACKGROUND
the studies on protein folding/unfolding indicate that the native state topology is an important determinant of protein folding mechanism. the folding/unfolding behaviors of proteins which have similar topologies have been studied under cartesian space and the results indicate that some proteins share the similar folding/unfolding characters.


RESULTS
we construct physical property space with twelve different physical properties. by studying the unfolding process of the protein g and protein l under the property space, we find that the two proteins have the similar unfolding pathways that can be divided into three types and the one which with the umbrella-shape represents the preferred pathway. moreover, the unfolding simulation time of the two proteins is different and protein l unfolding faster than protein g. additionally, the distributing area of unfolded state ensemble of protein l is larger than that of protein g.


CONCLUSIONS
under the physical property space, the protein g and protein l have the similar folding/unfolding behaviors, which agree with the previous results obtained from the studies under cartesian coordinate space. at the same time, some different unfolding properties can be detected easily, which can not be analyzed under cartesian coordinate space.
