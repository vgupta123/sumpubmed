BACKGROUND
flagellar secretion systems are utilized by a wide variety of bacteria to construct the flagellum, a conserved apparatus that allows for migration towards non-hostile, nutrient rich environments. chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligate, intracellular pathogen whose genome contains at least three orthologs of flagellar proteins, namely flii, flha and flif, but the role of these proteins remains unknown.


RESULTS
full length flii, and fragments of flha, flif, and flii, were cloned and expressed as either gst or his tagged proteins in e. coli. the gst-tagged full length flii protein was shown to possess atpase activity, hydrolyzing atp at a rate of  <dig>  ± . <dig> μmol min- <dig> mg- <dig> in a time- and dose-dependant manner. using bacterial-2-hybrid and gst pull-down assays, the n-terminal domain of flii was shown to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of flha, but not with flif, and the cytoplasmic domain of flha was shown to interact with the c-terminus of flif. the absence of other flagellar orthologs led us to explore cross-reaction of flagellar proteins with type iii secretion proteins, and we found that flii interacted with cdsl and copn, while flha interacted with cdsl and cpn <dig> .


CONCLUSIONS
the specific interaction of the four orthologous flagellar proteins in c. pneumoniae suggests that they interact in vivo and, taken together with their conservation across members of the chlamydiae sps., and their interaction with t3s components, suggests a role in bacterial replication and/or intracellular survival.
