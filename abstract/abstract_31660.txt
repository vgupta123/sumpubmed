BACKGROUND
development of lung alveolar sacs of normal structure and size at late gestation is necessary for the gas exchange process that sustains respiration at birth. mice lacking the lung differentiation gene t1α  fail to form expanded alveolar sacs, resulting in respiratory failure at birth. since little is known about the molecular pathways driving alveolar sacculation, we used expression microarrays to identify genes altered in the abnormal lungs and, by inference, may play roles in normal lung morphogenesis.


RESULTS
altered expression of genes related to cell-cell interaction, such as ephrina <dig>  are observed in t1α at e <dig> . at term, fosb, egr <dig>  mpk- <dig> and nur <dig>  which can function as negative regulators of the cell-cycle, are down-regulated. this is consistent with the hyperproliferation of peripheral lung cells in term t1α  lungs reported earlier. biochemical assays show that neither pcna nor p <dig> are altered at e <dig> . at term in contrast, pcna is increased, and p <dig> is decreased.


CONCLUSIONS
this global analysis has identified a number of candidate genes that are significantly altered in lungs in which sacculation is abnormal. many genes identified were not previously associated with lung development and may participate in formation of alveolar sacs prenatally.
