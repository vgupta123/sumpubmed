BACKGROUND
collagens require the hydroxylation of proline  residues in their triple-helical domain repeating sequence xaa-pro-gly to function properly as a main structural component of the extracellular matrix in animals at physiologically relevant conditions. the regioselective proline hydroxylation is catalyzed by a specific prolyl 4-hydroxylase  as a posttranslational processing step.


RESULTS
a recombinant human collagen type i α- <dig>  with high percentage of hydroxylated prolines  was produced in transgenic maize seeds when co-expressed with both the α- and β- subunits of a recombinant human p4h . germ-specific expression of rciα <dig> using maize globulin- <dig> gene promoter resulted in an average yield of  <dig> mg/kg seed for the full-length rciα <dig> in seeds without co-expression of rp4h and  <dig> mg/kg seed for the rciα <dig>  in seeds with co-expression of rp4h. high-resolution mass spectrometry  analysis revealed that nearly half of the collagenous repeating triplets in rciα <dig> isolated from rp4h co-expressing maize line had the pro residues changed to hyp residues. the hrms analysis determined the hyp content of maize-derived rciα1-oh as  <dig> %, which is comparable to the hyp level of yeast-derived rciα1-oh  and the native human cia <dig> , respectively. the increased hyp percentage was correlated with a markedly enhanced thermal stability of maize-derived rciα1-oh when compared to the non-hydroxylated rciα <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
this work shows that maize has potential to produce adequately modified exogenous proteins with mammalian-like post-translational modifications that may be require for their use as pharmaceutical and industrial products.
