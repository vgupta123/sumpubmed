BACKGROUND
the caseinolytic protease  is crucial for chloroplast biogenesis and proteostasis. the arabidopsis clp consists of two heptameric rings  assembled from nine distinct subunits. hsp <dig> chaperones  are believed to dock to the axial pores of clp and then transfer unfolded polypeptides destined to degradation. the adaptor proteins clpt <dig> and  <dig> attach to the protease, apparently blocking the chaperone binding sites. this competition was suggested to regulate clp activity. also, monomerization of clpt <dig> from dimers in the stroma triggers p and r rings association. so, oligomerization status of clpt <dig> seems to control the assembly of the clp protease.


RESULTS
in this work, clpt <dig> was obtained in a recombinant form and purified. in solution, it mostly consists of monomers while dimers represent a small fraction of the population. enrichment of the dimer fraction could only be achieved by stabilization with a crosslinker reagent. we demonstrate that clpt <dig> specifically interacts with the hsp <dig> chaperones clpc <dig> and clpd. in addition, clpt <dig> stimulates the atpase activity of clpd by more than 50% when both are present in a 1: <dig> molar ratio. outside this optimal proportion, the stimulatory effect of clpt <dig> on the atpase activity of clpd declines.


CONCLUSIONS
the accessory protein clpt <dig> behaves as a monomer in solution. it interacts with the chloroplastic hsp <dig> chaperones clpc <dig> and clpd and tightly modulates the atpase activity of the latter. our results provide new experimental evidence that may contribute to revise and expand the existing models that were proposed to explain the roles of this poorly understood regulatory protein.
