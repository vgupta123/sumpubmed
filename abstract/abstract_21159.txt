BACKGROUND
green and blue mold decay, caused by penicillium digitatum and p. italicum, respectively, are important postharvest diseases of citrus. biocontrol by microbes is an alternative to synthetic fungicide application. in this study, the antagonistic yeast strain kloeckera apiculata 34– <dig> was used to investigate the action mechanisms involved in the biocontrol of postharvest diseases.


RESULTS
an antifungal substance, 2-phenylethanol , was isolated from k. apiculata and demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity against selected phytopathogenic fungi. experiments on p. italicum cells identified the mitochondria and the nucleus as particularly sensitive to inhibition. regulation of p. italicum gene expression was investigated using rna-seq. pea up-regulated genes involved with the peroxisome, regulation of autophagy, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, fatty acid metabolism, and inhibited ribosome, rna polymerase, dna replication, amino acid biosynthesis, aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis and cell cycle. inhibitory responses revealed by rna-seq suggest that pea might compete for attachment on the active site of phenylalanyl-trna synthetase .


CONCLUSIONS
this study provided new insight on the mode of action of biocontrol yeast agents in controlling postharvest pathogenic fungi.
