BACKGROUND
the transcribed sequences of a cell, the transcriptome, represent the trans-acting fraction of the genetic information, yet eukaryotic cdna libraries are typically made from only the poly-adenylated fraction. the non-coding or translated but non-polyadenylated rnas are therefore not represented. the goal of this study was to develop a method that would more completely represent the transcriptome in a useful format, avoiding over-representation of some of the abundant, but low-complexity non-translated transcripts.


RESULTS
we developed a combination of self-subtraction and directional cloning procedures for this purpose. libraries were prepared from partially degraded  total rna from three different species. a restriction endonuclease site was added to the 3' end during first-strand synthesis using a directional random-priming technique. the abundant non-polyadenylated rrna and trna sequences were largely removed by using self-subtraction to equalize the representation of the various rna species. sequencing random clones from the libraries showed that 87% of clones were in the forward orientation with respect to known or predicted transcripts. 70% matched identified or predicted translated rnas in the sequence databases. abundant mrnas were less frequent in the self-subtracted libraries compared to a non-subtracted mrna library. 3% of the sequences were from known or hypothesized ncrna loci, including five matches to mirna loci.


CONCLUSIONS
we describe a simple method for making high-quality, directional, random-primed, cdna libraries from small amounts of degraded total rna. this technique is advantageous in situations where a cdna library with complete but equalized representation of transcribed sequences, whether polyadenylated or not, is desired.
