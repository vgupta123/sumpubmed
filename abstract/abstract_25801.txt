BACKGROUND
the grass carp hemorrhagic disease caused by the grass carp reovirus  is a major disease that hampers the development of grass carp aquaculture. the mechanism underlying gcrv pathogenesis and hemorrhagic symptoms is still unknown. micrornas  are key regulators involved in various biological processes. the aim of this study was to identify conserved and novel mirnas in grass carp in response to gcrv infection, as well as attempt to reveal the mechanism underlying gcrv pathogenesis and hemorrhagic symptoms.


RESULTS
grass carp were infected with gcrv, and spleen samples were collected at  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 9 days post-infection . these samples were used to construct and sequence small rna libraries. a total of  <dig> mirnas were identified, of which  <dig> were known mirnas and  <dig> were novel mirnas. thirty-six mirnas were identified to exhibit differential expression when compared with the control, and  <dig> target genes were predicted for the  <dig> mirnas. go and kegg enrichment analyses of these target genes showed that many of the significantly enriched terms were associated with immune response, blood coagulation, hemostasis, and complement and coagulation cascades, especially the go term “blood coagulation” and pathway “complement and coagulation cascades.” ten representative target genes involved in “complement and coagulation cascades” were selected for qpcr analysis, and the results showed that the expression patterns of these target genes were significantly upregulated at  <dig> dpi, suggesting that the pathway “complement and coagulation cascades” was strongly activated.


CONCLUSIONS
conserved and novel mirnas in response to gcrv infection were identified in grass carp, of which  <dig> were known mirnas and  <dig> were novel mirnas. many of the target genes involved in immune response, blood coagulation, hemostasis, and complement and coagulation cascades. strong activation of the pathway “complement and coagulation cascades” may have led to endothelial-cell and blood-cell damage and hemorrhagic symptoms. the present study provides a new insight into understanding the mechanism underlying gcrv pathogenesis and hemorrhagic symptoms.
