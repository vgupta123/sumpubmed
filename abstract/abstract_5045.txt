BACKGROUND
the arabidopsis thaliana lec <dig> gene encodes a b <dig> domain transcription factor, which plays critical roles during both zygotic and somatic embryogenesis. lec <dig> exerts significant impacts on determining embryogenic potential and various metabolic processes through a complicated genetic regulatory network.


RESULTS
an ortholog of the arabidopsis leafy cotyledon  <dig> gene  was characterized in theobroma cacao . tclec <dig> encodes a b <dig> domain transcription factor preferentially expressed during early and late zygotic embryo development. the expression of tclec <dig> was higher in dedifferentiated cells competent for somatic embryogenesis , compared to non-embryogenic calli. transient overexpression of tclec <dig> in immature zygotic embryos resulted in changes in gene expression profiles and fatty acid composition. ectopic expression of tclec <dig> in cacao leaves changed the expression levels of several seed related genes. the overexpression of tclec <dig> in cacao explants greatly increased the frequency of regeneration of stably transformed somatic embryos. tclec <dig> overexpressing cotyledon explants exhibited a very high level of embryogenic competency and when cultured on hormone free medium, exhibited an iterative embryogenic chain-reaction.


CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed essential roles of tclec <dig> during both zygotic and somatic embryo development. collectively, our evidence supports the conclusion that tclec <dig> is a functional ortholog of atlec <dig> and that it is involved in similar genetic regulatory networks during cacao somatic embryogenesis. to our knowledge, this is the first detailed report of the functional analysis of a lec <dig> ortholog in a species other then arabidopsis. tclec <dig> could potentially be used as a biomarker for the improvement of the se process and screen for elite varieties in cacao germplasm.
