BACKGROUND
protein model quality assessment is an essential component of generating and using protein structural models. during the tenth critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction , we developed and tested four automated methods  that predicted both local and global quality of protein structural models.


RESULTS
multicom-refine was a clustering approach that used the average pairwise structural similarity between models to measure the global quality and the average euclidean distance between a model and several top ranked models to measure the local quality. multicom-cluster and multicom-novel were two new support vector machine-based methods of predicting both the local and global quality of a single protein model. multicom-construct was a new weighted pairwise model comparison  method that used the weighted average similarity between models in a pool to measure the global model quality. our experiments showed that the pairwise model assessment methods worked better when a large portion of models in the pool were of good quality, whereas single-model quality assessment methods performed better on some hard targets when only a small portion of models in the pool were of reasonable quality.


CONCLUSIONS
since digging out a few good models from a large pool of low-quality models is a major challenge in protein structure prediction, single model quality assessment methods appear to be poised to make important contributions to protein structure modeling. the other interesting finding was that single-model quality assessment scores could be used to weight the models by the consensus pairwise model comparison method to improve its accuracy.
