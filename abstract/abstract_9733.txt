BACKGROUND
gene expression studies can be used to help identify disease-associated genes by comparing the levels of expressed transcripts between cases and controls, and to identify functional genetic variants  by comparing expression levels between individuals with different genotypes. while many of these studies are performed in blood or lymphoblastoid cell lines due to tissue accessibility, the relevance of expression differences in tissues that are not the primary site of disease is unclear. further, many eqtls are tissue specific. thus, there is a clear and compelling need to conduct gene expression studies in tissues that are specifically relevant to the disease of interest. one major technical concern about using autopsy-derived tissue is how representative it is of physiologic conditions, given the effect of postmortem interval on tissue degradation.


RESULTS
in this study, we monitored the gene expression of  <dig> tissue samples harvested from a rapid autopsy heart  and  <dig> from a cardiac explant  through  <dig> hours of autolysis. the  <dig> hour autopsy simulation was designed to reflect a typical autopsy scenario where a body may begin cooling to ambient temperature for ~ <dig> hours, before transportation and storage in a refrigerated room in a morgue. in addition, we also simulated a scenario wherein the body was left at room temperature for up to  <dig> hours before being found. a small fraction  of genes showed fluctuations in expression over the  <dig> hr period and largely belong to immune and signal response and energy metabolism-related processes. global expression analysis suggests that rna expression is reproducible over  <dig> hours of autolysis with 95% genes showing <  <dig>  fold change. comparing the rapid autopsy to the failed heart identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes, including several types of collagens, lumican , natriuretic peptide a  and connective tissue growth factor , which allows for the clear separation between failing and non-failing heart based on gene expression profiles.


CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that rna from autopsy-derived tissue, even up to  <dig> hours of autolysis, can be used to identify biologically relevant expression pattern differences, thus serving as a practical source for gene expression experiments.
