BACKGROUND
the proteins sm <dig> and sm <dig> from the biocontrol fungus trichoderma virens belong to the cerato-platanin protein family. members of this family are small, secreted proteins that are abundantly produced by filamentous fungi with all types of life-styles. some species of the fungal genus trichoderma are considered as biocontrol fungi because they are mycoparasites and are also able to directly interact with plants, thereby stimulating plant defense responses. it was previously shown that the cerato-platanin protein sm <dig> from t. virens - and to a lesser extent its homologue epl <dig> from trichoderma atroviride - induce plant defense responses. the plant protection potential of other members of the cerato-platanin protein family in trichoderma, however, has not yet been investigated.


RESULTS
in order to analyze the function of the cerato-platanin protein sm <dig>  sm <dig> and sm <dig> knockout strains were generated and characterized. the effect of the lack of sm <dig> and sm <dig> in t. virens on inducing systemic resistance in maize seedlings, challenged with the plant pathogen cochliobolus heterostrophus, was tested. these plant experiments were also performed with t. atroviride epl <dig> and epl <dig> knockout strains. in our plant-pathogen system t. virens was a more effective plant protectant than t. atroviride and the results with both trichoderma species showed concordantly that the level of plant protection was more strongly reduced in plants treated with the sm2/epl <dig> knockout strains than with sm1/epl <dig> knockout strains.


CONCLUSIONS
although the cerato-platanin genes sm1/epl <dig> are more abundantly expressed than sm2/epl <dig> during fungal growth, sm2/epl <dig> are, interestingly, more important than sm1/epl <dig> for the promotion of plant protection conferred by trichoderma in the maize-c. heterostrophus pathosystem.
