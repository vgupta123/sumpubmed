BACKGROUND
bruton tyrosine kinase  plays an important role in b-cell development, differentiation, and signaling. it is also found be in involved in male immunodeficiency disease such as x-linked agammaglobulinemia . btk is considered as a potential therapeutic target for treating autoimmune diseases and hematological malignancies.


RESULTS
in this work, a combined molecular modeling study was performed on a series of thieno  pyridine-4-amine derivatives as btk inhibitors. receptor-guided comfa  and comsia  models were generated based on the docked conformation of the most active compound  <dig>  all the developed models were tested for robustness using various validation techniques. furthermore, a 5-ns molecular dynamics  simulation and binding free energy calculations were carried out to determine the binding modes of the inhibitors and to identify crucial interacting residues. the rationality and stability of molecular docking and 3d-qsar results were validated by md simulation. the binding free energies calculated by the mm/pbsa method showed the importance of the van der waals interaction.


CONCLUSIONS
a good correlation between the md results, docking studies, and the contour map analysis were observed. the study has identified the key amino acid residues in btk binding pocket. the results from this study can provide some insights into the development of potent, novel btk inhibitors.
