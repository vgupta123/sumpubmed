BACKGROUND
inoculation of wheat plants with puccinia triticina  spores activates a wide range of host responses. compatible pt interaction with susceptible thatcher plants supports all stages of the pathogen life cycle. incompatible interaction with tclr <dig> activates defense responses including oxidative burst and micronecrotic reactions associated with the pathogen’s infection structures and leads to complete termination of pathogen development. these two contrasting host-pathogen interactions were a foundation for transcriptome analysis of incompatible wheat-pt interaction.

methods
a suppression subtractive hybridization  library was constructed using cdna from pathogen-inoculated susceptible thatcher and resistant tclr <dig> isogenic lines. cdna represented steps of wheat-brown rust interactions: spore germination, haustorium mother cell  formation and micronecrotic reactions. all ests were clustered and validated by similarity search to wheat genome using blastn and sim4db tools. qrt-pcr was used to determine transcript levels of selected ests after inoculation in both lines.

results and discussion
out of  <dig> isolated cdna clones,  <dig> were classified into  <dig> contigs.  <dig> cdna clones and encoded proteins were functionally annotated and assigned to  <dig> gene ontology categories: catalytic activity  <dig> clones , binding  <dig> clones , transporter activity  <dig> clones , structural molecule activity  <dig> clones  and molecular transducer activity  <dig> clone .

detailed expression profiles of  <dig> selected clones were analyzed using the same plant-pathogen system. the strongest induction after pathogen infection and the biggest differences between resistant and susceptible interactions were detected for clones encoding wall-associated kinase , receptor with leucine-rich repeat domain , putative serine/threonine protein kinase , calcium-mediated signaling protein  and 14-3- <dig> protein .

conclusions
the ssh library represents transcripts regulated by pathogen infection during compatible and incompatible interactions of wheat with p. triticina. annotation of selected clones confirms their putative roles in successive steps of plant-pathogen interactions. the transcripts can be categorized as defense-related due to their involvement in either basal defense or resistance through an r-gene mediated reaction. the possible involvement of selected clones in pathogen recognition and pathogen-induced signaling as well as resistance mechanisms such as cell wall enforcement, oxidative burst and micronecrotic reactions is discussed.
