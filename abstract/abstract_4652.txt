BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  is an important pathogen that infects a broad range of hosts. in humans, typhimurium causes a gastroenteritis characterized by vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pains. typhimurium infection occurs mainly through the ingestion of contaminated food including poultry, pork, eggs, and milk. chickens that are asymptomatic carriers of typhimurium constitute a potential reservoir for infection. the type three secretion systems encoded by salmonella pathogenicity islands   <dig> and  <dig> are major virulence factors of salmonella. however, only a few studies have investigated their role during the infection of chickens.


RESULTS
we have taken a mixed infection approach to study the contribution of spi <dig> and spi <dig> to the colonization of the chicken by typhimurium. we found that spi <dig> contributes to colonization of both the cecum and spleen in the chicken. in contrast, spi <dig> contributes to colonization of the spleen but not the cecum and, in the absence of spi <dig>  inhibits cecal colonization. additionally, we show that the contribution of spi <dig> in the spleen is greater than that of spi <dig>  these results are different from those observed during the infection of the mouse by typhimurium where spi <dig> is the major player during systemic colonization.


CONCLUSIONS
the co-infection model we used provides a sensitive assay that confirms the role of spi <dig> and clarifies the role of spi <dig> in the colonization of the chicken by typhimurium.
