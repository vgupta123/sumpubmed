BACKGROUND
our study focuses on identifying potential biomarkers for diagnosis and early detection of ovarian cancer  through the study of transcription regulation of genes affected by estrogen hormone.


RESULTS
the results are based on a set of  <dig> experimentally validated oc-associated genes compiled from several databases, and their subset controlled by estrogen. for these two gene sets we computationally determined transcription factors  that putatively regulate transcription initiation. we ranked these tfs based on the number of genes they are likely to control. in this way, we selected  <dig> top-ranked tfs as potential key regulators and thus possible biomarkers for a set of  <dig> oc-associated genes. for  <dig> estrogen controlled genes from this set we identified three unique tfs as potential biomarkers.


CONCLUSIONS
we introduced a new methodology to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers for oc. this report is the first bioinformatics study that explores multiple transcriptional regulators of oc-associated genes as potential diagnostic biomarkers in connection with estrogen responsiveness. we show that 64% of tf biomarkers identified in our study are validated based on real-time data from microarray expression studies. as an illustration, our method could identify cp <dig> that in combination with ca <dig> has been reported to be sensitive in diagnosing ovarian tumors.
