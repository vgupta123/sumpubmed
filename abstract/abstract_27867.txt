BACKGROUND

gossypium hirsutum l., or upland cotton, is an important renewable resource for textile fiber. to enhance understanding of the genetic basis of cotton earliness, we constructed an intra-specific recombinant inbred line population  containing  <dig> lines, and performed linkage map construction and quantitative trait locus  mapping.


RESULTS
using restriction-site associated dna sequencing, a genetic map composed of  <dig>  loci, including  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms and  <dig> simple sequence repeat loci, was developed from ril population. this map spanned  <dig> .98 cm, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. a total of  <dig> qtls for six earliness-related traits were detected in  <dig> consecutive years. in addition,  <dig> qtl coincidence regions representing more than 60 % of total qtls were found on  <dig> chromosomes, which indicated that several earliness-related traits might be simultaneously improved. fine-mapping of a 2-mb region on chromosome d <dig> associated with five stable qtls between marker <dig> and marker <dig> revealed that lines containing alleles derived from ccri <dig> in this region exhibited smaller phenotypes and earlier maturity. one candidate gene  was predicted and validated by quantitative real-time pcr in early-, medium- and late-maturing cultivars from 3- to 6-leaf stages, with highest expression level in early-maturing cultivar, ccri <dig>  lowest expression level in late-maturing cultivar, bomian <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
we developed an snp-based genetic map, and this map is the first high-density genetic map for short-season cotton and has the potential to provide deeper insights into earliness. cotton earliness-related qtls and qtl coincidence regions will provide useful materials for qtl fine mapping, gene positional cloning and mas. and the gene, emf <dig>  is promising for further study.
