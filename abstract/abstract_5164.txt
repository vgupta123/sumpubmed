BACKGROUND
the function of cd57+ cd4+ t cells, constituting a major subset of germinal center t  cells in human lymphoid tissues, has been unclear. there have been contradictory reports regarding the b cell helping function of cd57+ gc-th cells in production of immunoglobulin . furthermore, the cytokine and co-stimulation requirement for their helper activity remains largely unknown. to clarify and gain more insight into their function in helping b cells, we systematically investigated the capacity of human tonsil cd57+ gc-th cells in inducing b cell ig synthesis.


RESULTS
we demonstrated that cd57+ gc-th cells are highly efficient in helping b cell production of all four subsets of ig  compared to other t-helper cells located in germinal centers or interfollicular areas. cd57+ gc-th cells were particularly more efficient than other t cells in helping gc-b cells but not naïve b cells. cd57+ gc-th cells induced the expression of activation-induced cytosine deaminase  and class switch recombination in developing b cells. igg1- <dig> and iga <dig> were the major ig isotypes induced by cd57+ gc-th cells. cd40l, but not il- <dig>  il- <dig> and ifn-γ, was critical in cd57+ gc-th cell-driven b cell production of ig. however, il- <dig>  when added exogenously, significantly enhanced the helper activity of cd57+ gc-th cells, while tgf-β <dig> completely and ifn-γ partially suppressed the cd57+ gc-th cell-driven ig production.


CONCLUSIONS
cd57+cd4+ t cells in the germinal centers of human lymphoid tissues are the major t helper cell subset for gc-b cells in ig synthesis. their helper activity is consistent with their capacity to induce aid and class switch recombination, and can be regulated by cd40l, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tgf-β.
