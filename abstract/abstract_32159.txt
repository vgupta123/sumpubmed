BACKGROUND
members of a protein family often have highly conserved sequences; most of these sequences carry identical biological functions and possess similar three-dimensional  structures. however, enzymes with high sequence identity may acquire differential functions other than the common catalytic ability. it is probable that each of their variable regions consists of a unique peptide motif , which selectively interacts with other cellular proteins, rendering additional biological activities. the ability to identify and localize such upms is paramount in recognizing the characteristic role of each member of a protein family.


RESULTS
we have developed a reinforced merging algorithm  with which non-gapped upms were identified in a variety of query protein sequences including members of human ribonuclease a , epidermal growth factor receptor , matrix metalloproteinase , and sma-and-mad related protein families . the upms generally occupy specific positions in the resolved 3-d structures, especially the loop regions on the structural surfaces. these motifs coincide with the recognition sites for antibodies, as the epitopes of four monoclonal antibodies and two polyclonal antibodies were shown to overlap with the upms. most of the upms were found to correlate well with the potential antigenic regions predicted by protean. furthermore, an accuracy of 70% can be achieved in terms of mapping a upm to an epitope.


CONCLUSIONS
our study provides a bioinformatic approach for searching and predicting potential epitopes and interacting motifs that distinguish different members of a protein family.
