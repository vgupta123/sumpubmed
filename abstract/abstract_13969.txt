BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus, a gram-positive pathogen, causes many human infections. methicillin-resistant s. aureus  is the most common drug-resistance bacteria. nearly all mrsa bacteria are resistant to several drugs. specific antibodies are the main components of the host’s humoral immunity, and play a significant role in the process of the host’s resistance to bacterial infection.


RESULTS
a single-chain variable fragment  library was constructed using mrna from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of s. aureus infected volunteers. after the scfv library dna was transformed into escherichia coli tg <dig>  ~ <dig>  ×  <dig> independent clones with full-length scfv inserts. the scfv library was screened by phage display for three rounds using s. aureus as an antigen. the single clones were chosen at random and the scfvs were expressed for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  assessment. approximately 50 % of the clones were positive with good binding activity to s. aureus. to improve the stability of scfvs, scfv-fragment crystallizable regions  were constructed and expressed in e. coli dh5α. the expressed scfv-fcs were purified and identified by western blot. these antibodies were further characterized and analyzed for bioactivity. the results showed that the expression level and folding of scfv-fcs induced at 25 °c without isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside  were higher than that induced at 32 °c with  <dig>  mmol/l iptg. scfv-fcs had good bioactivity and could specifically bind with s. aureus.


CONCLUSIONS
scfv-fcs against s. aureus were successfully constructed and are good candidates for the development of future adjunctive therapy for severe s. aureus infections.
