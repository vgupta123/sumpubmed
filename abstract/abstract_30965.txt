BACKGROUND
estrogen receptor α  is a transcription factor whose activity is affected by multiple regulatory cofactors. in an effort to identify the human genes involved in the regulation of erα, we constructed a high-throughput, cell-based, functional screening platform by linking a response element  with a reporter gene. this allowed the cellular activity of erα, in cells cotransfected with the candidate gene, to be quantified in the presence or absence of its cognate ligand e <dig> 


RESULTS
from a library of  <dig> human cdna clones, we identified zinc finger protein  <dig>  as a repressor of erα mediated transactivation. znf <dig> is a typical member of the btb/poz family of transcription factors, and shows both ubiquitous expression and a high degree of sequence conservation. the luciferase reporter gene assay revealed that znf <dig> inhibits ligand-dependent transactivation by erα in a dose-dependent manner. electrophoretic mobility shift assay clearly demonstrated that the interaction between znf <dig> and erα interrupts or prevents erα binding to the estrogen response element . in addition, znf <dig> was able to suppress the expression of ps <dig>  an erα target gene.


CONCLUSIONS
we suggest that the functional screening platform we constructed can be applied for high-throughput genomic screening candidate erα-related genes. this in turn may provide new insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of erα regulation in mammalian cells.
