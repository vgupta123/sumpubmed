BACKGROUND
duchenne muscular dystrophy  is the most common x-linked muscle degenerative disease and it is due to the absence of the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin. currently there is no effective treatment for dmd. among the different strategies for achieving a functional recovery of the dystrophic muscle, the upregulation of the dystrophin-related gene utrophin is becoming more and more feasible.


RESULTS
we have previously shown that the zinc finger-based artificial transcriptional factor “jazz” corrects the dystrophic pathology in mdx mice by upregulating utrophin gene expression. here we describe a novel artificial transcription factor, named “utroup”, engineered to further improve the dna-binding specificity. utroup has been designed to recognise an extended dna target sequence on both the human and mouse utrophin gene promoters. the utroup dna-binding domain contains six zinc finger motifs in tandem, which is able to recognise an 18-base-pair dna target sequence that statistically is present only once in the human genome. to achieve a higher transcriptional activation, we coupled the utroup dna-binding domain with the innovative transcriptional activation domain, which was derived from the multivalent adaptor protein che-1/aatf. we show that the artificial transcription factor utroup, due to its six zinc finger tandem motif, possesses a low dissociation constant that is consistent with a strong affinity/specificity toward its dna-binding site. when expressed in mammalian cell lines, utroup promotes utrophin transcription and efficiently accesses active chromatin promoting accumulation of the acetylated form of histone h <dig> in the utrophin promoter locus.


CONCLUSIONS
this novel artificial molecule may represent an improved platform for the development of future applications in dmd treatment.
