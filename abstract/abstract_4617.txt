BACKGROUND
in a previous paper, we introduced muscle, a new program for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences, giving a brief summary of the algorithm and showing muscle to achieve the highest scores reported to date on four alignment accuracy benchmarks. here we present a more complete discussion of the algorithm, describing several previously unpublished techniques that improve biological accuracy and / or computational complexity. we introduce a new option, muscle-fast, designed for high-throughput applications. we also describe a new protocol for evaluating objective functions that align two profiles.


RESULTS
we compare the speed and accuracy of muscle with clustalw, progressive poa and the mafft script fftns <dig>  the fastest previously published program known to the author. accuracy is measured using four benchmarks: balibase, prefab, sabmark and smart. we test three variants that offer highest accuracy , highest speed , and a carefully chosen compromise between the two . we find muscle-fast to be the fastest algorithm on all test sets, achieving average alignment accuracy similar to clustalw in times that are typically two to three orders of magnitude less. muscle-fast is able to align  <dig>  sequences of average length  <dig> in  <dig> seconds on a current desktop computer.


CONCLUSIONS
muscle offers a range of options that provide improved speed and / or alignment accuracy compared with currently available programs. muscle is freely available at .
