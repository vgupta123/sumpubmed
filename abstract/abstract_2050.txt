BACKGROUND
despite the importance of the bcl2l <dig>  protein in various apoptotic processes in development and disease, little is known of the promoter structure of the human bcl2l <dig> locus and of the cis-acting elements regulating expression of the human gene.


RESULTS
in the search for novel promoter sequences in the human bcl2l <dig> locus, we have identified previously unrecognized genomic sequences displaying promoter activity and e2f responsiveness, and driving the expression of bcl2l <dig> coding transcripts. in man, transcripts originating from this novel putative promoter contribute significantly to total bcl2l <dig> mrna expression in testis, heart and liver. in hek <dig> cells, this novel candidate promoter originates bcl2l <dig> transcripts whose expression can be modulated by a known modulator of bcl2l <dig> expression  and by e2f, a characterized transcriptional regulator of bcl2l <dig> expression.


CONCLUSIONS
the identification of a novel putative human bcl2l <dig> promoter provides new insights into the structure and regulation of the bcl2l <dig> locus.
