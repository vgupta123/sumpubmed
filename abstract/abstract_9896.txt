BACKGROUND
although the genome sequence of the protozoan parasite leishmania major was determined several years ago, the knowledge of its transcriptome was incomplete, both regarding the real number of genes and their primary structure.


RESULTS
here, we describe the first comprehensive transcriptome analysis of a parasite from the genus leishmania. using high-throughput rna sequencing , a total of  <dig> transcripts were identified, of which  <dig> were considered novel, as they did not match previously annotated genes. in addition, our data indicate that current annotations should be modified for many of the genes. the detailed analysis of the transcript processing sites revealed extensive heterogeneity in the spliced leader  and polyadenylation addition sites. as a result, around 50% of the genes presented multiple transcripts differing in the length of the utrs, sometimes in the order of hundreds of nucleotides. this transcript heterogeneity could provide an additional source for regulation as the different sizes of utrs could modify rna stability and/or influence the efficiency of rna translation. in addition, for the first time for the leishmania major promastigote stage, we are providing relative expression transcript levels.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a concise view of the global transcriptome of the l. major promastigote stage, providing the basis for future comparative analysis with other development stages or other leishmania species.
