BACKGROUND
the pleistocene climatic oscillations are considered as a major driving force of intraspecific divergence and speciation. during ice ages, populations isolated in allopatric glacial refugia can experience differentiation in reproductive traits through divergence in selection regimes. this phenomenon may lead to reproductive isolation and dramatically accentuates the consequences of the climatic oscillations on species. alternatively, when reproductive isolation is incomplete and populations are expanding again, further mating between the formerly isolated populations can result in the formation of a hybrid zone, genetic introgression or reinforcement speciation through reproductive trait displacements. therefore changes in reproductive traits driven by population movements during climatic oscillations can act as an important force in promoting pre-zygotic isolation. notwithstanding, divergence of reproductive traits has not been approached in the context of climatic oscillations. here we investigate the impact of population movements driven by climatic oscillations on a reproductive trait of a bumblebee species . we characterise the pattern of variation and differentiation across the species distribution  with five genes , and  in the chemical composition of male marking secretions , a key trait for mate attraction in bumblebees.


RESULTS
our results provide evidence that populations have experienced a genetic allopatric differentiation, in at least three main refugia  during quaternary glaciations. the comparative chemical analyses show that populations from the southern italian refugium have experienced mms differentiation and an incipient speciation process from another refugium. the meeting of southern italian populations with other populations as a result of range expansion at a secondary contact zone seems to have led to a reinforcement process on local mms patterns.


CONCLUSIONS
this study suggests that population movement during quaternary climatic oscillations can lead to divergence in reproductive traits by allopatric differentiation during ice ages and by reinforcement during post-glacial recolonization.
