BACKGROUND
during the last years the analysis of microrna expression patterns has led to completely new insights into cancer biology. furthermore, these patterns are a very promising tool for the development of new diagnostic and prognostic markers. however, most human tumour samples for which long term clinical records are available exist only as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens. therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of microrna profiling studies in routinely processed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human breast cancer specimens using fluorescence labelled bead technology.


RESULTS
a statistically highly significant correlation  was observed for the expression of  <dig> micrornas in routinely processed ffpe breast cancer specimens and paired fresh frozen tissue samples . results were confirmed in a larger series analyzing a selection of  <dig> micrornas reported to be deregulated in breast cancer . the expression pattern of  <dig> micrornas was independently validated in this cohort using real-time rt-pcr technology.


CONCLUSIONS
comprehensive microrna expression patterns can be reliably derived from routinely processed ffpe breast cancer specimens using fluorescence labelled bead technology.
