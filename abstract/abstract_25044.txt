BACKGROUND
the tumor suppressor protein p <dig> is a transcription factor that is mutated in many cancers. regulation of gene expression by binding of wild-type p <dig> to its target sites is accompanied by changes in epigenetic marks like histone acetylation. we studied dna binding and epigenetic changes induced by wild-type and mutant p <dig> in non-malignant htert-immortalized human mammary epithelial cells overexpressing either wild-type p <dig> or one of four p <dig> mutants  on a wild-type p <dig> background.


RESULTS
using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to a  <dig>  human promoter microarray, we found that wild-type p <dig> bound  <dig> promoters on the microarray including known and novel p <dig> targets. of these p <dig> targets only 20% showed a concomitant increase in histone acetylation, which was linked to increased gene expression, while 80% of targets showed no changes in histone acetylation. we did not observe any decreases in histone acetylation in genes directly bound by wild-type p <dig>  dna binding in samples expressing mutant p <dig> was reduced over 95% relative to wild-type p <dig> and very few changes in histone acetylation and no changes in dna methylation were observed in mutant p <dig> expressing samples.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that wild-type p <dig> induces transcription of target genes by binding to dna and differential induction of histone acetylation at target promoters. several new wild-type p <dig> target genes, including dgkz, fbxo <dig> and gdf <dig>  were found. dna binding of wild-type p <dig> is highly compromised if mutant p <dig> is present due to interaction of both p <dig> forms resulting in no direct effect on epigenetic marks.
