BACKGROUND
low temperatures play key roles in the development of most plant diseases, mainly because of their influence on the expression of various virulence factors in phytopathogenic bacteria. thus far, studies regarding this environmental parameter have focused on specific themes and little is known about phytopathogenic bacteria physiology under these conditions. to obtain a global view regarding phytopathogenic bacteria strategies in response to physiologically relevant temperature changes, we used dna microarray technology to compare the gene expression profile of the model bacterial pathogen p. syringae pv. phaseolicola nps <dig> grown at 18째c and 28째c.


RESULTS
a total of  <dig> differentially regulated genes were identified, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated at 18째c compared to 28째c. the majority of these genes are involved in pathogenicity and virulence processes. in general, the results of this study suggest that the expression profile obtained may be related to the fact that low temperatures induce oxidative stress in bacterial cells, which in turn influences the expression of iron metabolism genes. the expression also appears to be correlated with the profile expression obtained in genes related to motility, biofilm production, and the type iii secretion system.


CONCLUSIONS
from the data obtained in this study, we can begin to understand the strategies used by this phytopathogen during low temperature growth, which can occur in host interactions and disease development.
