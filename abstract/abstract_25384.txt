BACKGROUND
musical ability has always been linked to enhanced cognitive and intellectual skills. we were interested in the relation between musical ability and short-time cognitive processing as measured by event-related potentials, in particular in visual processing, since previous studies have already suggested such a link for acoustic cognitive processing. we measured auditory and visual event-related potentials as elicited by an oddball paradigm in  <dig> healthy subjects . in addition, the seashore test and a test developed by the authors to detect relevant amusia, the latter one with a high ceiling effect, were also applied.


RESULTS
the most important finding was that there is a significant linear correlation between musical ability as measured by these tests and the p <dig> latencies of both the auditory and visual event-related potentials. furthermore, musicians showed shorter latencies of the event-related potentials than non-musicians.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that musical ability as measured by neuropsychological tests is associated with improved short-time cognitive processing both in the auditory and, surprisingly, also in the visual domain.
