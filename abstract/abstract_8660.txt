BACKGROUND
the aim of the present study was to develop a haemolytic assay for the study of the complement system in dairy goats  and to characterize the major goat complement system proteins.


RESULTS
the commonly used sheep erythrocyte sensitized with rabbit antibodies were not sensitive to lysis by goat serum, but the combination of human red blood cells  plus rabbit antibodies was the best option found for goat complement assay. a buffer based on hepes instead of the classical veronal  was developed. three proteins were isolated: factor h, c1q and c <dig> and these were compared with the corresponding human proteins. a novel affinity chromatography technique was developed for isolation of factor h.


CONCLUSIONS
human rbc plus rabbit antibodies were a suitable option for haemolytic assays. the isolated proteins are similar to the human counterparts.
