BACKGROUND
the present study coupled expression profiling with chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing  to examine peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ -dependent regulation of gene expression in mouse keratinocytes, a cell type that expresses pparβ/δ in high concentration.


RESULTS
microarray analysis elucidated eight different types of regulation that modulated pparβ/δ-dependent gene expression of  <dig> genes ranging from repression or activation without an exogenous ligand, repression or activation with an exogenous ligand, or a combination of these effects. bioinformatic analysis of chip-seq data demonstrated promoter occupancy of pparβ/δ for some of these genes, and also identified the presence of other transcription factor binding sites in close proximity to pparβ/δ bound to chromatin. for some types of regulation, atf <dig> is required for ligand-dependent induction of pparβ/δ target genes.


CONCLUSIONS
pparβ/δ regulates constitutive expression of genes in keratinocytes, thus suggesting the presence of one or more endogenous ligands. the diversity in the types of gene regulation carried out by pparβ/δ is consistent with dynamic binding and interactions with chromatin and indicates the presence of complex regulatory networks in cells expressing high levels of this nuclear receptor such as keratinocytes. results from these studies are the first to demonstrate that differences in dna binding of other transcription factors can directly influence the transcriptional activity of pparβ/δ.
