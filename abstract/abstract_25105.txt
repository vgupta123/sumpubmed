BACKGROUND
n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors  are the most complex of ionotropic glutamate receptors . subunits of this subfamily assemble into heteromers, which – depending on the subunit combination – may display very different pharmacological and electrophysiological properties. the least studied members of the nmdar family, the nr <dig> subunits, have been reported to assemble with nr <dig> to form excitatory glycine receptors in heterologous expression systems. the heterogeneity of nmdars in vivo is in part conferred to the receptors by splicing of the nr <dig> subunit, especially with regard to proton sensitivity.


RESULTS
here, we have investigated whether the nr3b subunit is capable of assembly with each of the eight functional nr <dig> splice variants, and whether the resulting receptors share the unique functional properties described for nr1-1a/nr <dig>  we provide evidence that functional excitatory glycine receptors formed regardless of the nr <dig> isoform, and their pharmacological profile matched the one reported for nr1-1a/nr3: glycine alone fully activated the receptors, which were insensitive to glutamate and block by mg2+. surprisingly, amplitudes of agonist-induced currents showed little dependency on the c-terminally spliced nr <dig> variants in nr1/nr3b diheteromers. even more strikingly, nr3b conferred proton sensitivity also to receptors containing nr1b variants – possibly via disturbing the "proton shield" of nr1b splice variants.


CONCLUSIONS
while functional assembly could be demonstrated for all combinations, not all of the specific interactions seen for nr <dig> isoforms with coexpressed nr <dig> subunits could be corroborated for nr <dig> assembly with nr <dig>  rather, nr <dig> abates trafficking effects mediated by the nr <dig> c terminus as well as the n-terminally mediated proton insensitivity. thus, this study establishes that nr3b overrides important nr <dig> splice variant-specific receptor properties in nr1/nr3b excitatory glycine receptors.
