BACKGROUND
second-generation sequencers generate millions of relatively short, but error-prone, reads. these errors make sequence assembly and other downstream projects more challenging. correcting these errors improves the quality of assemblies and projects which benefit from error-free reads.


RESULTS
we have developed a general-purpose error corrector that corrects errors introduced by illumina, ion torrent, and roche  <dig> sequencing technologies and can be applied to single- or mixed-genome data. in addition to correcting substitution errors, we locate and correct insertion, deletion, and homopolymer errors while remaining sensitive to low coverage areas of sequencing projects. using published data sets, we correct 94% of illumina miseq errors, 88% of ion torrent pgm errors, 85% of roche  <dig> gs junior errors. introduced errors are  <dig> to  <dig> times more rare than successfully corrected errors. furthermore, we show that the quality of assemblies improves when reads are corrected by our software.


CONCLUSIONS
pollux is highly effective at correcting errors across platforms, and is consistently able to perform as well or better than currently available error correction software. pollux provides general-purpose error correction and may be used in applications with or without assembly.
