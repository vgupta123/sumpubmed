BACKGROUND
copy number variations  are widespread in the human or animal genome and are a significant source of genetic variation, which has been demonstrated to play an important role in phenotypic diversity. advances in technology have allowed for identification of a large number of cnvs in cattle. comprehensive explore novel cnvs in the bovine genome would provide valuable information for functional analyses of genome structural variation and facilitating follow-up association studies between complex traits and genetic variants.


RESULTS
in this study, we performed a genome-wide cnv detection based on high-density snp genotyping data of  <dig> chinese holstein cattle. a total of  <dig> cnv regions  across the genome were identified, which cover  <dig> mb of the cattle genome and correspond to  <dig> % of the genome sequence. the length of the cnvrs on autosomes range from  <dig>  to  <dig> . <dig> kb with an average of  <dig>  kb.  <dig> out of these cnvrs contain  <dig> annotated genes, which possess a wide spectrum of molecular functions. to confirm these findings, quantitative pcr  was performed for  <dig> cnvrs and  <dig> of them were successfully validated.


CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates the high density snp array can significantly improve the accuracy and sensitivity of cnv calling. integration of different platforms can enhance the detection of genomic structure variants. our results provide a significant replenishment for the high resolution map of copy number variation in the bovine genome and valuable information for investigation of genomic structural variation underlying traits of interest in cattle.
