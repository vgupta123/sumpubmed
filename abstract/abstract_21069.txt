BACKGROUND
dwarfism is one of the most valuable traits in banana breeding because semi-dwarf cultivars show good resistance to damage by wind and rain. moreover, these cultivars present advantages of convenient cultivation, management, and so on. we obtained a dwarf mutant ‘8818-1’ through ems  mutagenesis of williams banana  <dig> . our research have shown that gibberellins  content in 8818- <dig> false stems was significantly lower than that in its parent  <dig> and the dwarf type of 8818- <dig> could be restored by application of exogenous ga <dig>  although ga exerts important impacts on the 8818- <dig> dwarf type, our understanding of the regulation of ga metabolism during banana dwarf mutant development remains limited.


RESULTS
genome-wide screening revealed  <dig> candidate ga metabolism genes were systematically identified for the first time; these genes included  <dig> macps,  <dig> maks,  <dig> mako,  <dig> makao,  <dig> maga20ox,  <dig> maga3ox, and  <dig> maga2ox genes. phylogenetic tree and conserved protein domain analyses showed sequence conservation and divergence. ga metabolism genes exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns. early ga biosynthesis genes were constitutively expressed but presented differential regulation in different tissues in williams banana. ga oxidase family genes were mainly transcribed in young fruits, thus suggesting that young fruits were the most active tissue involved in ga metabolism, followed by leaves, bracts, and finally approximately mature fruits. expression patterns between  <dig> and 8818- <dig> revealed that maga20ox <dig>  maga20ox <dig>  and maga20ox <dig> of the maga20ox gene family and maga2ox <dig>  maga2ox <dig>  and maga2ox <dig> of the maga2ox gene family exhibited significant differential expression and high-expression levels in false stems. these genes are likely to be responsible for the regulation of gas content in 8818- <dig> false stems.


CONCLUSIONS
overall, phylogenetic evolution, tissue specificity and differential expression analyses of ga metabolism genes can provide a better understanding of ga-regulated development in banana. the present results revealed that maga20ox <dig>  maga20ox <dig>  maga20ox <dig>  maga2ox <dig>  maga2ox <dig>  and maga2ox <dig> were the main genes regulating ga content difference between  <dig> and 8818- <dig>  all of these genes may perform important functions in the developmental processes of banana, but each gene may perform different functions in different tissues or during different developmental stages.
