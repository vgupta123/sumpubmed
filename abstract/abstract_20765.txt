BACKGROUND
acquisition of resistance to "anoikis" facilitates the survival of cells under independent matrix-deficient conditions, such as cells in tumor progression and the production of suspension culture cells for biomedical engineering. there is evidence suggesting that cd <dig>  an adhesion molecule associated with survival of cells in tumor metastasis and cell-cell contacts, plays an important role in resistance to anoikis. however, information regarding the functions of cd <dig> in mediating cell-cell contacts and anoikis-resistance remains limited and even self-contradictory.


RESULTS
an anoikis-resistant clone , derived from anoikis-sensitive parental human embryonic kidney  <dig> cells, survived anoikis by the formation of cell-cell contacts. the expression of hab18g/cd <dig>  was upregulated and the protein was located at cell-cell junctions. upregulation of hab18g/cd <dig> in suspended hek293ar cells suppressed anoikis by mediating the formation of cell-cell adhesions. anoikis resistance in hek293ar cells also required e-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts. knock-down of hab18g/cd <dig> and e-cadherin inhibited cell-cell contacts formation and increased anoikis sensitivity respectively. when hab18g/cd <dig> was downregulated, e-cadherin expression in hek293ar cells was significantly suppressed; however, knockdown of e-cadherin by e-cadherin sirna or blocking of e-cadherin binding activity with a specific antibody and edta had no significant effect on hab18g/cd <dig> expression. finally, pretreatment with ly <dig>  a phosphoinositide 3-kinase  inhibitor, disrupted cell-cell contacts and decreased cell number, but this was not the case in cells treated with the extracellular signal-regulated kinase  inhibitor pd <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our results provide new evidence that hab18g/cd147-mediated cell-cell contact confers anoikis resistance in an e-cadherin-dependent manner; and cell-cell contact mediated resistance to anoikis implicates pi3k pathway in a highly relevant cell model . understanding of the role of hab18g/cd <dig> cell-cell contacts in anoikis resistance may help in understanding the survival of cells in anchorage-independent growth, such as cells in tumor metastasis and suspension culture produced for biomedical engineering. our results also contribute to a better understanding of the biology of hek <dig> cell spheroids, a major workhorse for producing human therapeutic agents and viral vaccines.
