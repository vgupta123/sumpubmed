BACKGROUND
porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival dental plaque, as part of a mature biofilm, has been strongly implicated in the onset and progression of chronic periodontitis. in this study using dna microarray we compared the global gene expression of a p. gingivalis biofilm with that of its planktonic counterpart grown in the same continuous culture.


RESULTS
approximately 18%  of the p. gingivalis genome was differentially expressed when the bacterium was grown as a biofilm. genes that were down-regulated in biofilm cells, relative to planktonic cells, included those involved in cell envelope biogenesis, dna replication, energy production and biosynthesis of cofactors, prosthetic groups and carriers. a number of genes encoding transport and binding proteins were up-regulated in p. gingivalis biofilm cells. several genes predicted to encode proteins involved in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation were differentially regulated and may be important in the regulation of biofilm growth.


CONCLUSIONS
this study analyzing global gene expression provides insight into the adaptive response of p. gingivalis to biofilm growth, in particular showing a down regulation of genes involved in growth and metabolic activity.
