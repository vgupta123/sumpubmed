BACKGROUND
orthology analysis is an important part of data analysis in many areas of bioinformatics such as comparative genomics and molecular phylogenetics. the ever-increasing flood of sequence data, and hence the rapidly increasing number of genomes that can be compared simultaneously, calls for efficient software tools as brute-force approaches with quadratic memory requirements become infeasible in practise. the rapid pace at which new data become available, furthermore, makes it desirable to compute genome-wide orthology relations for a given dataset rather than relying on relations listed in databases.


RESULTS
the program proteinortho described here is a stand-alone tool that is geared towards large datasets and makes use of distributed computing techniques when run on multi-core hardware. it implements an extended version of the reciprocal best alignment heuristic. we apply proteinortho to compute orthologous proteins in the complete set of all  <dig> eubacterial genomes available at ncbi at the beginning of  <dig>  we identified thirty proteins present in 99% of all bacterial proteomes.


CONCLUSIONS
proteinortho significantly reduces the required amount of memory for orthology analysis compared to existing tools, allowing such computations to be performed on off-the-shelf hardware.
