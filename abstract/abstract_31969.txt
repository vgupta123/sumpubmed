BACKGROUND
entry into mitosis is regulated by cyclin dependent kinases that in turn are phosphoregulated. in most eukaryotes, phosphoregulation is through wee <dig> kinase and cdc <dig> phosphatase. in higher plants a homologous cdc <dig> gene is unconfirmed and hence the mitotic inducer schizosaccharomyces pombe  cdc <dig> has been used as a tool in transgenic plants to probe cell cycle function. expression of spcdc <dig> in tobacco by- <dig> cells accelerates entry into mitosis and depletes cytokinins; in whole plants it stimulates lateral root production. here we show, for the first time, that alterations to cytokinin and ethylene signaling explain the rooting phenotype elicited by spcdc <dig> expression in arabidopsis.


RESULTS
expressing spcdc <dig> in arabidopsis results in increased formation of lateral and adventitious roots, a reduction of primary root width and more isodiametric cells in the root apical meristem  compared with wild type. furthermore it stimulates root morphogenesis from hypocotyls when cultured on two way grids of increasing auxin and cytokinin concentrations. microarray analysis of seedling roots expressing spcdc <dig> reveals that expression of  <dig> genes is changed by > 2-fold. as well as genes related to stress responses and defence, these include  <dig> genes related to transcriptional regulation and signaling. amongst these was the up-regulation of genes associated with ethylene synthesis and signaling. seedlings expressing spcdc <dig> produced 2-fold more ethylene than wt and exhibited a significant reduction in hypocotyl length both in darkness or when exposed to  <dig> ppm ethylene. furthermore in spcdc <dig> expressing plants, the cytokinin receptor ahk <dig> was down-regulated, and endogenous levels of ipa were reduced whereas endogeous iaa concentrations in the roots increased.


CONCLUSIONS
we suggest that the reduction in root width and change to a more isodiametric cell phenotype in the ram in spcdc <dig> expressing plants is a response to ethylene over-production. the increased rooting phenotype in spcdc <dig> expressing plants is due to an increase in the ratio of endogenous auxin to cytokinin that is known to stimulate an increased rate of lateral root production. overall, our data reveal important cross talk between cell division and plant growth regulators leading to developmental changes.
