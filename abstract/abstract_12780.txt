BACKGROUND
β- <dig> -glucanases catalyze the hydrolysis of glucan polymers containing β- <dig> -linkages. these enzymes are of great biotechnological, agricultural and industrial interest. the applications of β- <dig> -glucanases is well established in fungal disease biocontrol, yeast extract production and wine extract clarification. thus, the identification and characterization of novel β- <dig> -glucanases with high catalytic efficiency and stability is of particular interest.


RESULTS
a β- <dig> -glucanase gene designated pgla was cloned from a newly isolated strain paenibacillus sp. s <dig>  the gene pgla contained a 2631-bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids which shows 76% identity with the β- <dig> -glucanase  from bacillus circulans iam <dig>  the encoded protein pgla is composed of a signal peptide, an n-terminal leader region, a glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  catalytic domain and a c-terminal immunoglobulin like  domain. the escherichia coli expression system of pgla and five truncated derivatives containing one or two modules was constructed to investigate the role of catalytic and non-catalytic modules. the ph for optimal activity of the enzymes was slightly affected  by the presence of different modules. however, the temperature for optimal activity was strongly influenced by the c-terminal domain and ranged from  <dig> to 60°c. deletion of c-terminal domain resulted in obviously enhancing enzymatic thermostability. specific activity assay indicated that pgla specifically hydrolyzes β- <dig> -glucan. insoluble β- <dig> -glucan binding and hydrolysis were boosted by the presence of n-and c-terminal domains. kinetic analysis showed that the presence of n-and c-terminus enhances the substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency of the catalytic domain toward laminarin. carbohydrate-binding assay directly confirmed the binding capabilities of the n-and c-terminal domains.


CONCLUSIONS
this study provides new insight into the impacts of non-catalytic modules on enzymatic properties of β- <dig> -glucanase. activity comparison of full-length pgla and truncated forms revealed the negative effect of c-terminal region on thermal stability of the enzyme. both the n-and c-terminal domains exerted strong binding activity toward insoluble β- <dig> -glucan, and could be classified into cbm families.
