BACKGROUND
the homeodomain leucine zipper  transcription factor family is one of the largest plant specific superfamilies, and includes genes with roles in modulation of plant growth and response to environmental stresses. many hd-zip genes are characterized in arabidopsis , and members of the family are being investigated for abiotic stress responses in rice , maize , poplar  and cucumber . findings in these species suggest hd-zip genes as high priority candidates for crop improvement.


RESULTS
in this study we have identified members of the hd-zip gene family in soybean cv. ‘williams 82’, and characterized their expression under dehydration and salt stress. homology searches with blastp and hidden markov model guided sequence alignments identified  <dig> hd-zip genes in the soybean genome. phylogeny reconstruction coupled with domain and gene structure analyses using soybean, arabidopsis, rice, grape , and medicago truncatula homologues enabled placement of these sequences into four previously described subfamilies. of the  <dig> hd-zip genes identified in soybean,  <dig> exist as whole-genome duplication-derived gene pairs, indicating high retention of these genes following polyploidy in glycine ~ <dig> mya. the hd-zip genes exhibit ubiquitous expression patterns across  <dig> conditions that include  <dig> tissues of soybean. an rna-seq experiment performed to study differential gene expression at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 12 hr soybean roots under dehydration and salt stress identified  <dig> differentially expressed  genes. several of these de genes are orthologs of genes previously reported to play a role under abiotic stress, implying conservation of hd-zip gene functions across species. screening of hd-zip promoters identified transcription factor binding sites that are overrepresented in the de genes under both dehydration and salt stress, providing further support for the role of hd-zip genes in abiotic stress responses.


CONCLUSIONS
we provide a thorough description of soybean hd-zip genes, and identify potential candidates with probable roles in dehydration and salt stress. expression profiles generated for all soybean genes, under dehydration and salt stress, at four time points, will serve as an important resource for the soybean research community, and will aid in understanding plant responses to abiotic stress.
