BACKGROUND
mannan is one of the primary polysaccharides in hemicellulose and is widely distributed in plants. β-mannosidase is an important constituent of the mannan-degrading enzyme system and it plays an important role in many industrial applications, such as food, feed and pulp/paper industries as well as the production of second generation bio-fuel. therefore, the mannose-tolerant β-mannosidase with high catalytic efficiency for bioconversion of mannan has a great potential in the fields as above.


RESULTS
a β-mannosidase gene  of  <dig>  bp was cloned from the extremely thermophilic bacterium thermotoga thermarum dsm  <dig> that encodes a protein containing  <dig> amino acid residues, and was over-expressed in escherichia coli bl <dig> . the results of phylogenetic analysis, amino acid alignment and biochemical properties indicate that the tth man <dig> is a novel β-mannosidase of glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  the optimal activity of the tth man <dig> β-mannosidase was obtained at ph  <dig>  and 85°c and was stable over a ph range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  and exhibited  <dig> h half-life at 90°c. the kinetic parameters km and vmax values for p-nitrophenyl-β-d-mannopyranoside and  <dig> -β-d-mannan were  <dig> ± <dig>  mm and  <dig> ± <dig>  μmol min- <dig> mg- <dig>   <dig> ± <dig>  mg ml- <dig> and  <dig> ± <dig>  μmol min- <dig> mg- <dig>  respectively. the kcat/km values for p-nitrophenyl-β-d-mannopyranoside and  <dig> -β-d-mannan were  <dig> ± <dig>  mm- <dig> s- <dig> and  <dig> ± <dig>  s- <dig> mg- <dig> ml, respectively. it displayed high tolerance to mannose, with a ki value of approximately  <dig> mm.


CONCLUSIONS
this work provides a novel and useful β-mannosidase with high mannose tolerance, thermostability and catalytic efficiency, and these characteristics constitute a powerful tool for improving the enzymatic conversion of mannan through synergetic action with other mannan-degrading enzymes.
