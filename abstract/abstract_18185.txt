BACKGROUND
soybean cyst nematode  is the most economically damaging pathogen of soybean  in the u.s. the rhg <dig> locus is repeatedly observed as the quantitative trait locus with the greatest impact on scn resistance. the glyma18g <dig>  gene at the rhg <dig> locus that encodes an apparent leucine-rich repeat transmembrane receptor-kinase  has been proposed to be the scn resistance gene, but its function has not been confirmed. generation of fertile transgenic soybean lines is difficult but methods have been published that test scn resistance in transgenic roots generated with agrobacterium rhizogenes.


RESULTS
we report use of artificial microrna  for gene silencing in soybean, refinements to transgenic root scn resistance assays, and functional tests of the rhg <dig> locus lrr-kinase gene. a nematode demographics assay monitored infecting nematode populations for their progress through developmental stages two weeks after inoculation, as a metric for scn resistance. significant differences were observed between resistant and susceptible control genotypes. introduction of the rhg <dig> locus lrr-kinase gene , into rhg1- scn-susceptible plant lines carrying the resistant-source rhg4+ locus, provided no significant increases in scn resistance. use of amirna to reduce expression of the lrr-kinase gene from the rhg <dig> locus of fayette  also did not detectably alter resistance to scn. however, silencing of the lrr-kinase gene did have impacts on root development.


CONCLUSIONS
the nematode demographics assay can expedite testing of transgenic roots for scn resistance. amirnas and the psm <dig> vector that drives interchangeable amirna constructs through a soybean polyubiqutin promoter , with an intron-gfp marker for detection of transgenic roots, may have widespread use in legume biology. studies in which expression of the rhg <dig> locus lrr-kinase gene from different resistance sources was either reduced or complemented did not reveal significant impacts on scn resistance.
