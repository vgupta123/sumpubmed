BACKGROUND
gabaa receptor-mediated neurotransmission is greatly influenced by cation-chloride cotransporter activity during developmental stages. in embryonic neurons na–k–2cl  cotransporters mediate active chloride uptake, thus increasing the intracellular chloride concentration associated with gaba-induced depolarization. at fetal stages near term, oxytocin-induced nkcc <dig> downregulation has been implicated in the developmental shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing gaba action. mature dorsal root ganglion neurons , however, express high nkcc <dig> levels and maintain high intracellular chloride levels with consequent gaba-induced depolarization.


RESULTS
gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp recordings were used to assess the developmental change in chloride homeostasis in rat cultured small drgn at the embryonic day  <dig>  and  <dig> . the results were compared to data previously obtained in fetal drgn at e <dig> and in mature cells. a significant nkcc <dig> downregulation, leading to reduction in excitatory gabaergic transmission, was observed at e <dig> and e <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
these results indicate that nkcc <dig> activity transiently decreases in drgn at fetal stages near term. this developmental shift in gabaergic transmission may contribute to fetal analgesia and neuroprotection at birth.
