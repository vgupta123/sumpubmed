BACKGROUND
high-throughput dna sequencing technologies are generating vast amounts of data. fast, flexible and memory efficient implementations are needed in order to facilitate analyses of thousands of samples simultaneously.


RESULTS
we present a multithreaded program suite called angsd. this program can calculate various summary statistics, and perform association mapping and population genetic analyses utilizing the full information in next generation sequencing data by working directly on the raw sequencing data or by using genotype likelihoods.


CONCLUSIONS
the open source c/c++ program angsd is available at http://www.popgen.dk/angsd. the program is tested and validated on gnu/linux systems. the program facilitates multiple input formats including bam and imputed beagle genotype probability files. the program allow the user to choose between combinations of existing methods and can perform analysis that is not implemented elsewhere.
