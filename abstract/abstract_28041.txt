BACKGROUND
the two myogenic regulatory factors myf <dig> and myod are basic helix-loop-helix muscle transcription factors undergoing differential cell cycle dependent proteolysis in proliferating myoblasts. this regulated degradation results in the striking expression of these two factors at distinct phases of the cell cycle, and suggests that their precise and alternated disappearance is an important feature of myoblasts, maybe connected to the maintenance of the proliferative status and/or commitment to the myogenic lineage of these cells. one way to understand the biological function of the cyclic expression of these proteins is to specifically alter their degradation, and to analyze the effects of their stabilization on cells. to this aim, we undertook the biochemical analysis of the mechanisms governing myf <dig> mitotic degradation, using heterologous systems.


RESULTS
we show here that mitotic degradation of myf <dig> is conserved in non-myogenic cells, and is thus strictly under the control of the cell cycle apparatus. using xenopus egg extracts as an in vitro system to dissect the main steps of myf <dig> mitotic proteolysis, we show that  myf <dig> stability is regulated by a complex interplay of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, probably involving various kinases and phosphatases,  myf <dig> is ubiquitylated in mitotic extracts, and this is a prerequisite to its degradation by the proteasome and  at least in the xenopus system, the e <dig> responsible for its mitotic degradation is not the apc/c .


CONCLUSIONS
altogether, our data strongly suggest that the mitotic degradation of myf <dig> by the ubiquitin-proteasome system is precisely controlled by multiple phosphorylation of the protein, and that the apc/c is not involved in this process.
