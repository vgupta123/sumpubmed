BACKGROUND
unsaturated fatty acids are susceptible to oxidation and damaged chains are removed from glycerophospholipids by phospholipase a <dig>  de-acylated lipids are then re-acylated by lysophospholipid acyltransferase enzymes such as lpcat <dig> which catalyses the formation of phosphatidylcholine  from lysopc and long-chain acyl-coa.


RESULTS
activity of lpcat <dig> is inhibited by ca2+, and a ca2+-binding motif of the ef-hand type, efh- <dig>  was identified in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein. the residues asp- <dig> and glu- <dig> define the loop of the hairpin structure formed by efh- <dig>  substitution of d <dig> and e <dig> to alanine rendered an enzyme insensitive to ca2+, which established that ca2+ binding to that region negatively regulates the activity of the acyltransferase amino-terminal domain. residue cys- <dig> of the conserved motif iii is not essential for catalysis and not sufficient for sensitivity to treatment by sulfhydryl-modifier agents. among the several active cysteine-substitution mutants of lpcat <dig> generated, we identified one to be resistant to treatment by sulfhydryl-alkylating and sulfhydryl-oxidizer agents.


CONCLUSIONS
mutant forms of lpcat <dig> that are not inhibited by ca2+ and sulfhydryl-alkylating and –oxidizing agents will provide a better understanding of the physiological function of a mechanism that places the formation of pc, and the disposal of the bioactive species lysopc, under the control of the redox status and ca2+ concentration of the cell.
