BACKGROUND
transgenerational epigenetics  are currently considered important in disease, but the mechanisms involved are not yet fully understood. tge abnormalities expected to cause disease are likely to be initiated during development and to be mediated by aberrant gene expression associated with aberrant promoter methylation that is heritable between generations. however, because methylation is removed and then re-established during development, it is not easy to identify promoter methylation abnormalities by comparing normal lineages with those expected to exhibit tge abnormalities.

methods
this study applied the recently proposed principal component analysis -based unsupervised feature extraction to previously reported and publically available gene expression/promoter methylation profiles of rat primordial germ cells, between e <dig> and e <dig> of the f <dig> generation vinclozolin lineage that are expected to exhibit tge abnormalities, to identify multiple genes that exhibited aberrant gene expression/promoter methylation during development.


RESULTS
the biological feasibility of the identified genes were tested via enrichment analyses of various biological concepts including pathway analysis, gene ontology terms and protein-protein interactions. all validations suggested superiority of the proposed method over three conventional and popular supervised methods that employed t test, limma and significance analysis of microarrays, respectively. the identified genes were globally related to tumors, the prostate, kidney, testis and the immune system and were previously reported to be related to various diseases caused by tge.


CONCLUSIONS
among the genes reported by pca-based unsupervised feature extraction, we propose that chemokine signaling pathways and leucine rich repeat proteins are key factors that initiate transgenerational epigenetic-mediated diseases, because multiple genes included in these two categories were identified in this study.
