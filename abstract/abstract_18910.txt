BACKGROUND
lymphotoxin signaling via the lymphotoxin-β receptor  has been implicated in biological processes ranging from development of secondary lymphoid organs, maintenance of spleen architecture, host defense against pathogens, autoimmunity, and lipid homeostasis. the major transcription factor that is activated by ltβr crosslinking is nf-κb. two signaling pathways have been described, the classical inhibitor of nf-κb α -regulated and the alternative p100-regulated pathway that result in the activation of p50-rela and p52-relb nf-κb heterodimers, respectively.


RESULTS
using microarray analysis, we investigated the transcriptional response downstream of the ltβr in mouse embryonic fibroblasts  and its regulation by the rela and relb subunits of nf-κb. we describe novel ltβr-responsive genes that were regulated by rela and/or relb. the majority of ltβr-regulated genes required the presence of both rela and relb, revealing significant crosstalk between the two nf-κb activation pathways. gene ontology  analysis confirmed that ltβr-nf-κb target genes are predominantly involved in the regulation of immune responses. however, other biological processes, such as apoptosis/cell death, cell cycle, angiogenesis, and taxis were also regulated by ltβr signaling. moreover, ltβr activation inhibited expression of a key adipogenic transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ , suggesting that ltβr signaling may interfere with adipogenic differentiation.


CONCLUSIONS
microarray analysis of ltβr-stimulated fibroblasts provided comprehensive insight into the transcriptional response of ltβr signaling and its regulation by the nf-κb family members rela and relb.
