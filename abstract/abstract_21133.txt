BACKGROUND
quantitative trait locus  theory predicts that genetic influence on complex traits involves multiple genes of small effect size. to detect qtl associations of small effect size, large samples and systematic screens of thousands of dna markers are required. an efficient solution is to genotype case and control dna pools using snp microarrays. we demonstrate that this is practical using dna pools of  <dig> individuals.


RESULTS
using standard microarray protocols for the affymetrix genechipÂ® mapping  <dig> k array xba  <dig>  we show that relative allele signal  values provide a quantitative index of allele frequencies in pooled dna that correlate  <dig>  with allele frequencies for  <dig> snps that were genotyped individually for  <dig> individuals. the sensitivity of the assay was demonstrated empirically in a spiking experiment in which 15% and 20% of one individual's dna was added to a dna pool.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that this approach, which we call snp-map , is rapid, cost effective and promises to be a valuable initial screening method in the hunt for qtls.
