BACKGROUND
canine mammary tumors  are the most common type of cancer found in female dogs. establishment and evaluation of tumor cell lines can facilitate investigations of the biological mechanisms of cancer. different cell models are used to investigate genetic, epigenetic, and cellular pathways, cancer progression, and cancer therapeutics. establishment of new cell models will greatly facilitate research in this field. in the present study, we established and characterized two new cmt cell lines derived from a single cmt.


RESULTS
we established two cell lines from a single malignant cmt specimen: dtk-e and dtk-sme. morphologically, the dtk-e cells were large, flat, and epithelial-like, whereas dtk-sme cells were round and epithelial-like. doubling times were 24 h for dtk-e and 18 h for dtk-sme. on western blots, both cell lines expressed cytokeratin ae <dig>  vimentin, cytokeratin  <dig> , and heat shock protein  <dig> . moreover, investigation of chemoresistance revealed that dtk-sme was more resistant to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis than dtk-e was. after xenotransplantation, both dtk-e and dtk-sme tumors appeared within 14 days, but the average size of dtk-sme tumors was greater than that of dtk-e tumors after 56 days.


CONCLUSIONS
we established two new cell lines from a single cmt, which exhibit significant diversity in cell morphology, protein marker expression, tumorigenicity, and chemoresistance. the results of this study revealed that the dtk-sme cell line was more resistant to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and exhibited higher tumorigenicity in vivo than the dtk-e cell line. we anticipate that the two novel cmt cell lines established in this study will be useful for investigating the tumorigenesis of mammary carcinomas and for screening anticancer drugs.
