BACKGROUND
nodulation and symbiotic nitrogen fixation are mediated by several genes, both of the host legume and of the bacterium. the rhizobial regulatory nodd gene plays a critical role, orchestrating the transcription of the other nodulation genes. rhizobium tropici strain ciat  <dig> is an effective symbiont of several legumes—with an emphasis on common bean —and is unusual in carrying multiple copies of nodd, the roles of which remain to be elucidated.


RESULTS
phenotypes, nod factors and gene expression of nodd <dig> and nodd <dig> mutants of ciat  <dig> were compared with those of the wild type strain, both in the presence and in the absence of the nod-gene-inducing molecules apigenin and salt . differences between the wild type and mutants were observed in swimming motility and iaa  synthesis. in the presence of both apigenin and salt, large numbers of nod factors were detected in ciat  <dig>  with fewer detected in the mutants. nodc expression was lower in both mutants; differences in nodd <dig> and nodd <dig> expression were observed between the wild type and the mutants, with variation according to the inducing molecule, and with a major role of apigenin with nodd <dig> and of salt with nodd <dig>  in the nodd <dig> mutant, nodulation was markedly reduced in common bean and abolished in leucaena  and siratro , whereas a mutation in nodd <dig> reduced nodulation in common bean, but not in the other two legumes.


CONCLUSIONS
our proposed model considers that full nodulation of common bean by r. tropici requires both nodd <dig> and nodd <dig>  whereas, in other legume species that might represent the original host, nodd <dig> plays the major role. in general, nodd <dig> is an activator of nod-gene transcription, but, in specific conditions, it can slightly repress nodd <dig>  nodd <dig> and nodd <dig> play other roles beyond nodulation, such as swimming motility and iaa synthesis.
