BACKGROUND
in an earlier study we developed a unique strategy allowing us to specifically eliminate antigen-specific murine b cells via their distinct b cell receptors using a new class of fusion proteins. in the present work we elaborated our idea to demonstrate the feasibility of specifically addressing and eliminating human memory b cells.


RESULTS
the present study reveals efficient adaptation of the general approach to selectively target and eradicate human memory b cells. in order to demonstrate the feasibility we engineered a fusion protein following the principle of recombinant immunotoxins by combining a model antigen  for b cell receptor targeting and a truncated version of pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin a  to induce apoptosis after cellular uptake. the ttc-eta’ fusion protein not only selectively bound to a ttc-reactive murine b cell hybridoma cell line in vitro but also to freshly isolated human memory b cells from immunized donors ex vivo. specific toxicity was confirmed on an antigen-specific population of human cd27+ memory b cells.


CONCLUSIONS
this protein engineering strategy can be used as a generalized platform approach for the construction of therapeutic fusion proteins with disease-relevant antigens as b cell receptor-binding domains, offering a promising approach for the specific depletion of autoreactive b-lymphocytes in b cell-driven autoimmune diseases.
