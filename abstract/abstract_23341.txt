BACKGROUND
micrornas  are key components in post-transcriptional gene regulation in multicellular organisms. as they control cooperatively a large number of their target genes, they affect the complexity of gene regulation. one of the challenges to understand mirna-mediated regulation is to identify co-regulating mirnas that simultaneously regulate their target genes in a network perspective.


RESULTS
we created mirna association network by using mirnas sharing target genes based on sequence complementarity and co-expression patterns of mirna-target pairs. the degree of association between mirnas can be assessed by the level of concordance between targets of mirnas. cooperatively regulating mirnas have been identified by network topology-based approach. cooperativity of mirnas is evaluated by their shared transcription factors and functional coherence of target genes. pathway enrichment analysis of target genes in the cooperatively regulating mirnas revealed the mutually exclusive functional landscape of mirna cooperativity. in addition, we found that one mirna in the mirna association network could be involved in many cooperatively regulating mirnas in a condition-specific and combinatorial manner. sequence and structural similarity analysis within mirna association network showed that pre-mirna secondary structure may be involved in the expression of mature mirna's function.


CONCLUSIONS
on the system level, we identified cooperatively regulating mirnas in the mirna association network. we showed that the secondary structures of pre-mirnas in cooperatively regulating mirnas are highly similar. this study demonstrates the potential importance of the secondary structures of pre-mirnas in both cooperativity and specificity of target genes.
