BACKGROUND
epistasis is one of the central themes in viral evolution due to its importance in drug resistance, immune escape, and interspecies transmission. however, there is a lack of experimental approach to systematically probe for epistatic residues.


RESULTS
by utilizing the information from natural occurring sequences and high-throughput genetics, this study established a novel strategy to identify epistatic residues. the rationale is that a substitution that is deleterious in one strain may be prevalent in nature due to the presence of a naturally occurring compensatory substitution. here, high-throughput genetics was applied to influenza a virus m segment to systematically identify deleterious substitutions. comparison with natural sequence variation showed that a deleterious substitution m <dig> q214h was prevalent in circulating strains. a coevolution analysis was then performed and indicated that m <dig> residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> naturally coevolved as a group. subsequently, we experimentally validated that m <dig> a209t was a compensatory substitution for m <dig> q214h.


CONCLUSIONS
this work provided a proof-of-concept to identify epistatic residues by coupling high-throughput genetics with phylogenetic information. in particular, we were able to identify an epistatic interaction between m <dig> substitutions a209t and q214h. this analytic strategy can potentially be adapted to study any protein of interest, provided that the information on natural sequence variants is available.
