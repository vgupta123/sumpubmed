BACKGROUND
although language mapping by repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation  gains importance in neuropsychological research and clinical utility, neuroscientists still use different mapping protocols including different stimulation frequencies. to refine the existing language protocol, we tested two different repetition rates of  <dig> hz/ <dig> pulses and  <dig> hz/ <dig> pulses with a  <dig> ms delay in  <dig> healthy subjects. we furthermore investigated differences between both frequencies in case of performance of four different language tasks: object naming, pseudoword reading, verb generation, and action naming.


RESULTS
even the small variance in frequencies revealed statistically significant differences concerning the number and type of language errors. stimulation with  <dig> hz evoked a higher number of all occurred language errors in all language tasks  vs. 12% ; pseudoword reading 4%  vs. 3% ; verb generation 13%  vs. 11% ; action naming 11%  vs. 9% ), whereas  <dig> hz evoked specifically more total speech arrests.


CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that the stimulation frequency has to be adapted to the aim of the rtms language investigation.
