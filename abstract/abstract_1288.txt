BACKGROUND
the incidence of malignant melanoma has significantly increased over the last decade. some of these malignancies are susceptible to the growth inhibitory and pro-differentiating effects of all-trans-retinoic acid . the molecular changes responsible for the biological activity of ra in melanoma are not well understood.


RESULTS
in an analysis of sequential global gene expression changes during a 4â€“ <dig> h ra treatment of b <dig> mouse melanoma cells, we found that ra increased the expression of  <dig> genes and decreased the expression of  <dig> genes. we also compared the gene expression profile  between non-malignant melan-a mouse melanocytes and b <dig> melanoma cells. using the same statistical test, we found  <dig> genes whose expression was significantly higher in melan-a than in b <dig> cells and  <dig> genes whose expression was significantly lower in melan-a than in b <dig> cells. by intersecting these two gene sets, we discovered a common set of  <dig> genes whose rna levels were significantly different between b <dig> and melan-a cells and whose expression was altered by ra treatment. within this set, ra treatment altered the expression of  <dig>  genes toward the melan-a expression level. in addition, hierarchical clustering showed that after  <dig> h of ra treatment expression of the  <dig> genes was more closely related to the melan-a gene set than any other ra treatment time point. functional analysis of the  <dig> gene set indicated that ra decreased expression of mrnas that encode proteins involved in cell division/cell cycle, dna replication, recombination and repair, and transcription regulation. conversely, it stimulated genes involved in cell-cell signaling, cell adhesion and cell differentiation/embryonic development. pathway analysis of the  <dig> gene set revealed four major hubs of connectivity: cdc <dig>  chek <dig>  cdc45l and mcm <dig> 


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis of common genes in the  <dig> h ra-treatment of b <dig> melanoma cells and untreated b <dig> vs. melan-a data set show that ra "normalized" the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism, dna replication, dna repair and differentiation. these results are compatible with the known growth inhibitory and pro-differentiating effects of ra. pathway analysis suggests that cdc <dig>  chek <dig>  cdc45l and mcm <dig> are key players in mediating the biological activity of ra in b <dig> melanoma cells.
