BACKGROUND
murine leukemia virus-type endogenous retroviruses  constitute ~10% of the mouse genome and are associated with various pathophysiologic processes. in this study, we examined whether mulv-ervs’ response to burn-elicited stressors is specific for certain lymphocyte populations and/or locations of lymphoid organ.


RESULTS
b- and t-cells, which were sorted from nine lymphoid organs of c57bl/6j mice after burn, were subjected to mulv-erv expression analyses. overall, the post-burn mulv-erv expression pattern was dependent on lymphocyte type, time after injury, location of lymphoid organ, and mulv-erv type. for instance, the mulv-erv expression in t-cells from the thymus and three cervical lymph nodes decreased at  <dig> hours post-burn while the expression of some mulv-ervs was augmented in b-cells derived from the mesenteric lymph node. the mulv-erv u <dig> sequences population of the burn- <dig> hours group was less diverse in comparison to the no burn and burn- <dig> hours groups. in addition, it was apparent that at the  <dig> hours time point, the u <dig> populations of b-cells from both no burn and burn groups were less heterogeneous than the t-cells’ u <dig> populations. using the u <dig> sequences, some of which were isolated only from specific experimental groups , as probes,  <dig> putative mulv-ervs, including  <dig> full-length proviruses, were mapped followed by characterization of their biologic properties.


CONCLUSIONS
mulv-ervs’ response to burn-elicited stressors may be differentially controlled depending on lymphocyte type, location of lymphoid organ, mulv-erv type, and stress duration.
