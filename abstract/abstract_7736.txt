BACKGROUND
vibrio cholerae is widely acknowledged as one of the most important waterborne pathogen causing gastrointestinal disorders. cholera toxin  is a major virulence determinant of v. cholerae. detection of ct-producing v. cholerae using conventional culture-, biochemical- and immunological-based assays is time-consuming and laborious, requiring more than three days. thus, we developed a novel and highly specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification  assay for the sensitive and rapid detection of cholera toxin -producing vibrio cholerae.


RESULTS
the assay provided markedly more sensitive and rapid detection of ct-producing v. cholerae strains than conventional biochemical and pcr assays. the assay correctly identified  <dig> ct-producing v. cholerae strains, but did not detect  <dig> ct non-producing v. cholerae and  <dig> non-v. cholerae strains. sensitivity of the lamp assay for direct detection of ct-producing v. cholerae in spiked human feces was  <dig>  Ã—  <dig> cfu per g . the sensitivity of the lamp assay was 10-fold more sensitive than that of the conventional pcr assay. the lamp assay for detection of ct-producing v. cholerae required less than  <dig> min with a single colony on thiosulfate citrate bile salt sucrose  agar and  <dig> min with human feces from the beginning of dna extraction to final determination.


CONCLUSIONS
the lamp assay is a sensitive, rapid and simple tool for the detection of ct-producing v. cholerae and will be useful in facilitating the early diagnosis of human v. cholerae infection.
