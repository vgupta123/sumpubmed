BACKGROUND
in this study, we investigated the effect of the extracellular matrix on
endothelial dysfunction by careful observation of human umbilical vein
endothelial cells  cultured on denatured collagen film.


RESULTS
huvecs on denatured collagen film showed relatively high surface roughness
compared with normal huvecs. the expression levels of mmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig> and cd146
increased in the ecs on denatured collagen film. in addition, we examined
the accumulation of fluorescent beads on huvec layers subjected to
circulatory flow. the number of accumulated fluorescent beads increased on
the disorganized huvec layers.


CONCLUSIONS
the proposed in vitro study using bio-inspired collagen films could
potentially be used in the size- and ligand-based design of drugs to treat
endothelial dysfunction caused by circulatory vascular diseases.
