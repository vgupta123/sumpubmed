BACKGROUND
campylobacter jejuni is widespread in the environment and is the major cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in humans. in the present study we use microarray-based comparative genomic hybridizations , pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  and multilocus sequence typing  to analyze closely related c. jejuni isolates from chicken and human infection.


RESULTS
with the exception of one isolate, the microarray data clusters the isolates according to the five groups determined by pfge. in contrast, mlst defines only three genotypes among the isolates, indicating a lower resolution. all methods show that there is no inherit difference between isolates infecting humans and chicken, suggesting a common underlying population of c. jejuni. we further identify regions that frequently differ between isolates, including both previously described and novel regions. finally, we show that genes that belong to certain functional groups differ between isolates more often than expected by chance.


CONCLUSIONS
in this study we demonstrated the utility of 70-mer oligonucleotide microarrays for genotyping of campylobacter jejuni isolates, with resolution outperforming mlst.
