BACKGROUND
conger eel galectins, congerin i  and congerin ii , show the different molecular characteristics resulting from accelerating evolution. we recently reconstructed a probable ancestral form of congerins, con-anc. it showed properties similar to those of conii in terms of thermostability and carbohydrate recognition specificity, although it shares a higher sequence similarity with coni than conii.


RESULTS
in this study, we have focused on the different amino acid residues between con-anc and coni, and have performed the protein engineering of con-anc through site-directed mutagenesis, followed by the molecular evolution analysis of the mutants. this approach revealed the functional importance of loop structures of congerins:  n- and c-terminal and loop  <dig> regions that are involved in conferring a high thermostability to coni;  loops  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> that are responsible for stronger binding of coni to most sugars; and  loops  <dig> and  <dig>  and thr <dig> residue in loop  <dig> contribute the specificity of coni toward lacto-n-fucopentaose-containing sugars.


CONCLUSIONS
thus, this methodology, with tracing of the molecular evolution using ancestral mutants, is a powerful tool for the analysis of not only the molecular evolutionary process, but also the structural elements of a protein responsible for its various functions.
