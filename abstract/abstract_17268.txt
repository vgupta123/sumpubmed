BACKGROUND
daysleeper is a domesticated transposase that is essential for development in arabidopsis thaliana . it is derived from a hat-superfamily transposon and contains many of the features found in the coding sequence of these elements . this work sheds light on the expression of this gene and localization of its product in protoplasts and in planta. using deletion constructs, important domains in the protein were identified.


RESULTS
daysleeper is predominantly expressed in meristems, developing flowers and siliques. the protein is mainly localized in the nucleus, but can also be seen in discrete foci in the cytoplasm. using several vesicular markers, we found that these foci belong to vesicular structures of the trans-golgi network, multivesicular bodies  and late endosomes. the central region as well as both the n- and the c-terminus are essential to daysleeper function, since versions of daysleeper deleted for these regions are not able to complement the daysleeper phenotype. like hat-transposases, we show that daysleeper has a functionally conserved dimerization domain .


CONCLUSIONS
daysleeper has retained the global structure of hat transposases and it seems that most of these conserved features are essential to daysleeperâ€™s cellular function. although structurally similar, daysleeper seems to have broadened its range of action beyond the nucleus in comparison to transposases.
