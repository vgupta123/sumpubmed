BACKGROUND
network co-regulated modules are believed to have the functionality of packaging multiple biological entities, and can thus be assumed to coordinate many biological functions in their network neighbouring regions.


RESULTS
here, we weighted edges of a human protein interaction network and a transcriptional regulatory network to construct an integrated network, and introduce a probabilistic model and a bipartite graph framework to exploit human co-regulated modules and uncover their specific features in packaging different biological entities . finally, we identified  <dig> human co-regulated modules based on this method, and evaluate its effectiveness by comparing it with four other methods.


CONCLUSIONS
dysfunctions in co-regulated interactions often occur in the development of cancer. therefore, we focussed on an example co-regulated module and found that it could integrate a number of cancer-related genes. this was extended to causal dysfunctions of some complexes maintained by several physically interacting proteins, thus coordinating several metabolic pathways that directly underlie cancer.
