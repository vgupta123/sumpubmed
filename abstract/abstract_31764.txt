BACKGROUND
different isoforms of cytochrome p <dig>  metabolized different types of substrates  and make them soluble during biotransformation. therefore, fate of any drug molecule depends on how they are treated or metabolized by cyp isoform. there is a need to develop models for predicting substrate specificity of major isoforms of p <dig>  in order to understand whether a given drug will be metabolized or not. this paper describes an in-silico method for predicting the metabolizing capability of major isoforms .


RESULTS
all models were trained and tested on  <dig> approved drug molecules. firstly,  <dig> molecular descriptors for each drug molecule were calculated using various softwares. secondly, best  <dig> descriptors were selected using general and genetic algorithm. thirdly, support vector machine  based qsar models were developed using  <dig> best descriptors and achieved an average accuracy of  <dig> %, evaluated using fivefold cross-validation. we have also evaluated the performance of our model on an independent dataset of  <dig> drug molecules and achieved average accuracy  <dig> %. in addition, svm based models were developed using  <dig> chemistry development kit  molecular descriptors and achieved an average accuracy of  <dig> %.


CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that svm based qsar model can predict substrate specificity of major cyp isoforms with high accuracy. these models can be used to predict isoform responsible for metabolizing a drug molecule. thus these models can used to understand whether a molecule will be metabolized or not. this is possible to develop highly accurate models for predicting substrate specificity of major isoforms using cdk descriptors. a web server metapred has been developed for predicting metabolizing isoform of a drug molecule http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/metapred/.
