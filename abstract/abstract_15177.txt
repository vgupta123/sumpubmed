BACKGROUND
it has been proposed that anatomical differences in human and great ape guts arose in response to species-specific diets and energy demands. to investigate functional genomic consequences of these differences, we compared their physiological levels of phytanic acid, a branched chain fatty acid that can be derived from the microbial degradation of chlorophyll in ruminant guts. humans who accumulate large stores of phytanic acid commonly develop cerebellar ataxia, peripheral polyneuropathy, and retinitis pigmentosa in addition to other medical conditions. furthermore, phytanic acid is an activator of the ppar-alpha transcription factor that influences the expression of genes relevant to lipid metabolism.


RESULTS
despite their trace dietary phytanic acid intake, all great ape species had elevated red blood cell  phytanic acid levels relative to humans on diverse diets. unlike humans, chimpanzees showed sexual dimorphism in rbc phytanic acid levels, which were higher in males relative to females. cultured skin fibroblasts from all species had a robust capacity to degrade phytanic acid. we provide indirect evidence that great apes, in contrast to humans, derive significant amounts of phytanic acid from the hindgut fermentation of plant materials. this would represent a novel reduction of metabolic activity in humans relative to the great apes.


CONCLUSIONS
we identified differences in the physiological levels of phytanic acid in humans and great apes and propose this is causally related to their gut anatomies and microbiomes. phytanic acid levels could contribute to cross-species and sex-specific differences in human and great ape transcriptomes, especially those related to lipid metabolism. based on the medical conditions caused by phytanic acid accumulation, we suggest that differences in phytanic acid metabolism could influence the functions of human and great ape nervous, cardiovascular, and skeletal systems.
