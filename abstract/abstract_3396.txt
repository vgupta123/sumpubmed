BACKGROUND
cucumis melo  belongs to the cucurbitaceae family, whose economic importance among horticulture crops is second only to solanaceae. melon has high intra-specific genetic variation, morphologic diversity and a small genome size , which make this species suitable for a great variety of molecular and genetic studies that can lead to the development of tools for breeding varieties of the species. a number of genetic and genomic resources have already been developed, such as several genetic maps and bac genomic libraries. these tools are essential for the construction of a physical map, a valuable resource for map-based cloning, comparative genomics and assembly of whole genome sequencing data. however, no physical map of any cucurbitaceae has yet been developed. a project has recently been started to sequence the complete melon genome following a whole-genome shotgun strategy, which makes use of massive sequencing data. a bac-based melon physical map will be a useful tool to help assemble and refine the draft genome data that is being produced.


RESULTS
a melon physical map was constructed using a  <dig>  Ã— bac library and a genetic map previously developed in our laboratories. high-information-content fingerprinting  was carried out on  <dig>  bac clones, digesting with five restriction enzymes and snapshot labeling, followed by contig assembly with fpc software. the physical map has  <dig>  contigs and  <dig> singletons, with an estimated physical length of  <dig> mb  and the longest contig being  <dig>  mb. the anchoring of  <dig> bac clones to  <dig> genetic markers  also allowed the genetic positioning of  <dig> physical map contigs/singletons, representing  <dig> mb  of the melon genome, to individual chromosomal loci. the melon fpc database is available for download at http://melonomics.upv.es/static/files/public/physical_map/.


CONCLUSIONS
here we report the construction of the first physical map of a cucurbitaceae species described so far. the physical map was integrated with the genetic map so that a number of physical contigs, representing 12% of the melon genome, could be anchored to known genetic positions. the data presented is already helping to improve the quality of the melon genomic sequence available as a result of a project currently being carried out in spain, adopting a whole genome shotgun approach based on  <dig> sequencing data.
