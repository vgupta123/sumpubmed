BACKGROUND
the ability to obtain profiles of gene expressions, proteins and metabolites with the advent of high throughput technologies has advanced the study of pathway and network reconstruction. genome-wide network reconstruction requires either interaction measurements or large amount of perturbation data, often not available for mammalian cell systems. to overcome these shortcomings, we developed a three stage integrative pathway search  approach to reconstruct context-specific active pathways involved in conferring a specific phenotype, from limited amount of perturbation data. the approach was tested on human liver cells to identify pathways that confer cytotoxicity.


RESULTS
this paper presents a systems approach that integrates gene expression and cytotoxicity profiles to identify a network of pathways involved in free fatty acid  and tumor necrosis factor-α  induced cytotoxicity in human hepatoblastoma cells . cytotoxicity relevant genes were first identified and then used to reconstruct a network using bayesian network  analysis. bn inference was used subsequently to predict the effects of perturbing a gene on the other genes in the network and on the cytotoxicity. these predictions were subsequently confirmed through the published literature and further experiments.


CONCLUSIONS
the tips© approach is able to reconstruct active pathways that confer a particular phenotype by integrating gene expression and phenotypic profiles. a web-based version of tips© that performs the analysis described herein can be accessed at .
