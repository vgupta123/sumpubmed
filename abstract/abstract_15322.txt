BACKGROUND
klebsiella pneumoniae  is a bacterium causing severe pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts and is often associated with sepsis. with the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria, there is a need for new effective and affordable control methods; understanding the genetic architecture of susceptibility to kp will help in their development. we performed the first quantitative trait locus  mapping study of host susceptibility to kp infection in immunocompetent collaborative cross mice . we challenged  <dig> mice from  <dig> cc lines intraperitoneally with  <dig> colony forming units of kp strain k <dig>  survival and body weight were monitored for 15 days post challenge.  <dig> of the cc lines were genotyped with  <dig>  snps, with which we mapped qtls.


RESULTS
cc lines differed significantly  in mean survival time, between  <dig> to 15 days post infection, and broad sense heritability was  <dig> . distinct qtl were mapped at specific time points during the challenge. a qtl on chromosome  <dig> was found only on day  <dig> post infection, and qtl on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  only on day  <dig>  by using the sequence variations of the eight inbred strain founders of the cc to refine qtl localization we identify several candidate genes.


CONCLUSIONS
host susceptibility to kp is a complex trait, controlled by multiple genetic factors that act sequentially during the course of infection.
