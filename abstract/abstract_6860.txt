BACKGROUND
androgenesis  is generally induced by means of irradiating the eggs to inactivate the maternal genome, followed by fertilization with normal sperm. in fish, the conventional technique for induced androgenesis has been applied for rapid fixation to traits, recovery of cryopreserved genotypes, sex-control, etc. a new method of androgenesis that eliminates the need to irradiate the egg was proposed using the loach, misgurnus anguillicaudatus .


RESULTS
when the eggs of wild-type females were fertilized with sperm of albino or orange phenotype males and cold-shocked at  <dig> to 3Â°c for  <dig> min duration just after fertilization, generally more than 30%  of the hatched progeny were androgenotes. while a few of them were the normal diploid, most of them turned out to be abnormal haploid. all-male inheritance was verified by the expression of the recessive color trait  and microsatellite genotypes comprising only paternally derived alleles. nuclear behavior after the cold-shock treatment was traced by microscopic observation of dapi -stained samples and hematoxylin-eosin stained histological sections, and the extrusion of egg  nucleus was observed in eggs treated in the optimum timing.


CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we demonstrate that cold-shock treatment  of loach eggs for  <dig> min just after fertilization successfully induces androgenetic haploid development. the most likely mechanism of cold-shock induced androgenesis is an elimination of the egg nucleus together along with the second polar body and subsequent development of a decondensed sperm nucleus or male pronucleus.
