BACKGROUND
soybean mosaic virus  is the most prevalent viral disease in many soybean production areas. due to a large number of smv resistant loci and alleles, smv strains and the rapid evolution in avirulence/effector genes, traditional breeding for smv resistance is complex. genetic engineering is an effective alternative method for improving smv resistance in soybean. potassium  is the most abundant inorganic solute in plant cells, and is involved in plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. studies have shown that altering the level of k+ status can reduce the spread of the viral diseases. thus k+ transporters are putative candidates to target for soybean virus resistance.


RESULTS
the addition of k+ fertilizer significantly reduced smv incidence. analysis of k+ channel gene expression indicated that gmakt <dig>  the ortholog of arabidopsis k+ weak channel encoding gene akt <dig>  was significantly induced by smv inoculation in the smv highly-resistant genotype rsmv <dig>  but not in the susceptible genotype ssmv <dig>  transgenic soybean plants overexpressing gmakt <dig> were produced and verified by southern blot and rt-pcr analysis. analysis of k+ concentrations on different leaves of both the transgenic and the wildtype  plants revealed that overexpression of gmakt <dig> significantly increased k+ concentrations in young leaves of plants. in contrast, k+ concentrations in the old leaves of the gmakt2-oe plants were significantly lower than those in wt plants. these results indicated that gmakt <dig> acted as a k+ transporter and affected the distribution of k+ in soybean plants. starting from 14Â days after inoculation  of smv g <dig>  severe mosaic symptoms were observed on the wt leaves. in contrast, the gmakt2-oe plants showed no symptom of smv infection. at  <dig> and  <dig> dai, the amount of smv rna in wt plants increased 200- and 260- fold relative to gmakt2-oe plants at each time point. thus, smv development was significantly retarded in gmakt2-overexpressing transgenic soybean plants.


CONCLUSIONS
overexpression of gmakt <dig> significantly enhanced smv resistance in transgenic soybean. thus, alteration of k+ transporter expression is a novel molecular approach for enhancing smv resistance in soybean.
