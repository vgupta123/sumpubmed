BACKGROUND
somalogic’s somascan™ assay platform allows the analysis of the relative abundance of over  <dig> proteins directly from biological matrices such as blood plasma and serum. the data resulting from the assay is provided in a proprietary text-based format not easily imported into r.


RESULTS
readat is an r package for working with the somalogic adat file format. it provides functionality for importing, transforming and annotating data from these files. the package is free, open source, and available on bioconductor and bitbucket.


CONCLUSIONS
readat integrates into both bioconductor and traditional r workflows, rendering it easy to make use of adat files.
