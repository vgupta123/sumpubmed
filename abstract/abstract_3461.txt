BACKGROUND
distinct, partly competing, “waves” have been proposed to explain human migration in today’s island southeast asia and australia based on genetic  evidence. the paucity of high quality and high resolution data has impeded insights so far. in this study, one of the first in a forensic environment, we used the ion torrent personal genome machine  for generating complete mitogenome sequences via stand-alone massively parallel sequencing and describe a standard data validation practice.


RESULTS
in this first representative investigation on the mitochondrial dna  variation of east timor  population including > <dig> individuals, we put special emphasis on the reconstruction of the initial settlement, in particular on the previously poorly resolved haplogroup p <dig>  an indigenous lineage of the southwest pacific region. our results suggest a colonization of southern sahul  > <dig> kya, limited subsequent exchange, and a parallel incubation of initial settlers in northern sahul  followed by westward migrations < <dig> kya.


CONCLUSIONS
the temporal proximity and possible coincidence of these latter dispersals, which encompassed autochthonous haplogroups, with the postulated “later” events of  east asian origin pinpoints a highly dynamic migratory phase.
