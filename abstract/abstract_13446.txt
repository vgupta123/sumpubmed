BACKGROUND
the nuclear factor i  family of dna binding proteins  is involved in both dna replication and gene expression regulation. using chromatin immuno-precipitation and high throughput sequencing , we performed a genome-wide mapping of nfi dna binding sites in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts.


RESULTS
we found that in vivo and in vitro nfi dna binding specificities are indistinguishable, as in vivo chip-seq nfi binding sites matched predictions based on previously established position weight matrix models of its in vitro binding specificity. combining chip-seq with mrna profiling data, we found that nfi preferentially associates with highly expressed genes that it up-regulates, while binding sites were under-represented at expressed but unregulated genes. genomic binding also correlated with markers of transcribed genes such as histone modifications h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig>  even outside of annotated transcribed loci, implying nfi in the control of the deposition of these modifications. positional correlation between + and - strand chip-seq tags revealed that, in contrast to other transcription factors, nfi associates with a nucleosomal length of cleavage-resistant dna, suggesting an interaction with positioned nucleosomes. in addition, nfi binding prominently occurred at boundaries displaying discontinuities in histone modifications specific of expressed and silent chromatin, such as loci submitted to parental allele-specific imprinted expression.


CONCLUSIONS
our data thus suggest that nfi nucleosomal interaction may contribute to the partitioning of distinct chromatin domains and to epigenetic gene expression regulation.
