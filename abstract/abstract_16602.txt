BACKGROUND
toxoplasmosis, caused by the obligate intracellular parasite toxoplasma gondii, is an important zoonotic disease worldwide. the precise detection of t. gondii infection in dogs has important public health significance. in this study, recombinant granule antigen proteins gra <dig> and gra <dig> were evaluated as potential diagnostic markers for t. gondii infection in dogs by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .


RESULTS
gra <dig> and gra <dig> were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and the recombinant gra <dig>  gra7- and toxoplasma lysate antigen -based elisas were developed and evaluated using the canine positive and negative serum samples for anti-t. gondii antibodies determined by modified agglutination test  and indirect fluorescent antibody test , showing a seroprevalence of  <dig> % by tla- and gra1-elisa, and  <dig> % by gra7-elisa, and no significant difference was observed . when compared with the two reference assays, mat and ifat, the gra7-elisa showed the highest co-positivity and co-negativity rates. receiver operating characteristic  analysis revealed a largest area under curve  of  <dig>  , and a highest relative sensitivity  and specificity  for a cut-off value of  <dig>  in gra7-elisa.


CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study showed that gra7-elisa is highly sensitive and specific, and gra <dig> is a potential serodiagnostic marker for the detection of t. gondii infection in dogs.
