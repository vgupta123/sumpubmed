BACKGROUND
n-linked protein glycosylation plays an important role in various biological processes, including protein folding and trafficking, and cell adhesion and signaling. the acquisition of a novel n-glycosylation site may have significant effect on protein structure and function, and therefore, on the phenotype.


RESULTS
we analyzed the human glycoproteome data set  and identified  <dig> novel n-glycosylation sites in  <dig> proteins that arose in the human lineage since the last common ancestor of euarchonta . three of them, asn- <dig> in adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein , asn- <dig> in cluster of differentiation  <dig> , and asn- <dig> in thyroglobulin, are human-specific. molecular evolutionary analysis suggested that these sites were under positive selection during human evolution. notably, the asn- <dig> of thyroglobulin might be involved in the increased production of thyroid hormones in humans, especially thyroxine , because the removal of the glycan moiety from this site was reported to result in a significant decrease in t <dig> production.


CONCLUSIONS
we propose that the novel n-glycosylation sites described in this study may be useful candidates for functional analyses to identify innovative genetic modifications for beneficial phenotypes acquired in the human lineage.
