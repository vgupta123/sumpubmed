BACKGROUND
since  <dig>  there have been in excess of  <dig> cases of rabies as a result of european bat lyssaviruses types  <dig> and  <dig>  infection, mainly in serotine and myotis bats respectively. these viruses have rarely been reported to infect humans and terrestrial mammals, as the only exceptions are sheep in denmark, a stone marten in germany and a cat in france. the purpose of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of foxes to eblvs using silver foxes  as a model.


RESULTS
our experimental studies have shown that the susceptibility of foxes to eblvs is low by the intramuscular  route, however, animals were sensitive to intracranial  inoculation. mortality was 100% for both eblv- <dig>  and eblv- <dig>  delivered by the ic route. virus dissemination and inflammatory infiltrate in the brain were demonstrated but virus specific neutralising antibody  was limited  =  <dig> – <dig>  and  <dig> – <dig>  respectively for specific eblv- <dig> and eblv-2). foxes were also susceptible, at a low level, to peripheral  infection  with eblv- <dig> but not eblv- <dig>  three out of  <dig>  foxes developed clinical signs between  <dig> and  <dig> days post-eblv- <dig> infection. none of the animals given eblv- <dig> developed clinical disease.


CONCLUSIONS
these data suggest that the chance of a eblv spill-over from bat to fox is low, but with a greater probability for eblv- <dig> than for eblv- <dig> and that foxes seem to be able to clear the virus before it reaches the brain and cause a lethal infection.
