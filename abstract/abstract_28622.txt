BACKGROUND
small-molecule compounds that inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  infection can be used not only as drug candidates, but also as reagents to dissect the life cycle of the virus. thus, it is desirable to have an arsenal of such compounds that inhibit hiv- <dig> infection by various mechanisms. until now, only a few small-molecule compounds that inhibit nuclear entry of viral dna have been documented.


RESULTS
we identified a novel, small-molecule compound, sjp-l- <dig>  that inhibits hiv- <dig> infection. sjp-l- <dig> is a nitrogen-containing, biphenyl compound whose synthesis was based on the dibenzocyclooctadiene lignan gomisin m <dig>  an anti-hiv bioactive compound isolated from schisandra micrantha a. c. smith. sjp-l- <dig> displayed relatively low cytotoxicity  and high antiviral activity against a variety of hiv strains ) of hiv- <dig> laboratory-adapted strains ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  μg/ml; ec50s of primary isolates ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  μg/ml). analyses of the viral dna synthesis indicated that sjp-l- <dig> specifically blocks the entry of the hiv- <dig> pre-integration complex  into the nucleus. further results implicated that sjp-l- <dig> inhibits the disassembly of hiv- <dig> particulate capsid in the cytoplasm of the infected cells.


CONCLUSIONS
sjp-l- <dig> is a novel small-molecule compound that inhibits hiv- <dig> nuclear entry by blocking the disassembly of the viral core.
