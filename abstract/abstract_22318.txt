BACKGROUND
baculovirus, which has a width of  <dig> nm and a length of 250- <dig> nm, can display functional peptides, receptors and antigens on its surface by their fusion with a baculovirus envelop protein, gp <dig>  in addition, some transmembrane proteins can be displayed without gp <dig> fusion, using the native transmembrane domains of the baculovirus. we used this functionality to display human prorenin receptor fused with gfpuv  on the surface of silkworm bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus  and then tested whether these baculovirus particles could be used to detect protein-protein interactions.


RESULTS
bmnpv displaying gfpuv-hprr  was purified from hemolymph by using sephacryl s- <dig> column chromatography in the presence of  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  its recovery was 86% and the final baculovirus particles number was  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu. based on the results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ,  <dig> % of the total proteins in bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr were gfpuv-hprr. this value was similar to that calculated from the result of western blot by a densitometry . to determine whether bmnpv-gfpuv-hprr particles were bound to human prorenin, elisa results were compared with those from elisas using protease negative bmnpv displaying β <dig> -n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase  <dig> fused with the gene encoding gfpuv   particles, which do not display hprr on their surfaces.


CONCLUSIONS
the display of on the surface of the bmnpv particles will be useful for the detection of protein-protein interactions and the screening of inhibitors and drugs in their roles as nanobioparticles.
