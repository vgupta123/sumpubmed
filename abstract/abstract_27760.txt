BACKGROUND
genetic maps provide an important genomic resource for understanding genome organization and evolution, comparative genomics, mapping genes and quantitative trait loci, and associating genomic segments with phenotypic traits. spruce  genomics work is quite challenging, mainly because of extremely large size and highly repetitive nature of its genome, unsequenced and poorly understood genome, and the general lack of advanced-generation pedigrees. our goal was to construct a high-density genetic linkage map of black spruce , which is a predominant, transcontinental species of the north american boreal and temperate forests, with high ecological and economic importance.


RESULTS
we have developed a near-saturated and complete genetic linkage map of black spruce using a three-generation outbred pedigree and amplified fragment length polymorphism , selectively amplified microsatellite polymorphic loci , expressed sequence tag polymorphism , and microsatellite  markers. maternal, paternal, and consensus genetic linkage maps were constructed. the maternal, paternal, and consensus maps in our study consistently coalesced into  <dig> linkage groups, corresponding to the haploid chromosome number  of  <dig> in the genus picea. the maternal map had  <dig> and the paternal map  <dig> markers distributed over  <dig> linkage groups each. the consensus map consisted of  <dig>  markers distributed over  <dig> linkage groups, and covered almost the entire  black spruce genome. the mapped markers included  <dig> aflps,  <dig> sampl,  <dig> microsatellites, and  <dig> estps. total estimated length of the genetic map was  <dig>  cm, with an average of one marker every  <dig>  cm. the maternal, paternal and consensus genetic maps aligned almost perfectly.


CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed the first high density to near-saturated genetic linkage map of black spruce, with greater than 97% genome coverage. also, this is the first genetic map based on a three-generation outbred pedigree in the genus picea. the genome length in p. mariana is likely to be about  <dig>  cm. the genetic maps developed in our study can serve as a reference map for various genomics studies and applications in picea and pinaceae.
