BACKGROUND
lizards are evolutionarily the most closely related vertebrates to humans that can lose and regrow an entire appendage. regeneration in lizards involves differential expression of hundreds of genes that regulate wound healing, musculoskeletal development, hormonal response, and embryonic morphogenesis. while micrornas are able to regulate large groups of genes, their role in lizard regeneration has not been investigated.


RESULTS
microrna sequencing of green anole lizard  regenerating tail and associated tissues revealed  <dig> putative novel and  <dig> known microrna precursors. eleven micrornas were differentially expressed between the regenerating tail tip and base during maximum outgrowth , including mir-133a, mir-133b, and mir- <dig>  which have been reported to regulate regeneration and stem cell proliferation in other model systems. three putative novel differentially expressed micrornas were identified in the regenerating tail tip.


CONCLUSIONS
differentially expressed micrornas were identified in the regenerating lizard tail, including known regulators of stem cell proliferation. the identification of  <dig> putative novel micrornas suggests that regulatory networks, either conserved in vertebrates and previously uncharacterized or specific to lizards, are involved in regeneration. these findings suggest that differential regulation of micrornas may play a role in coordinating the timing and expression of hundreds of genes involved in regeneration.
