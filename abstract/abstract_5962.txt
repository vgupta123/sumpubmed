BACKGROUND
the faunal and floral relationship of northward-drifting india with its neighboring continents is of general biogeographic interest as an important driver of regional biodiversity. however, direct biogeographic connectivity of india and southeast asia during the cenozoic remains largely unexplored. we investigate timing, direction and mechanisms of faunal exchange between india and southeast asia, based on a molecular phylogeny, molecular clock-derived time estimates and biogeographic reconstructions of the asian freshwater crab family gecarcinucidae.


RESULTS
although the gecarcinucidae are not an element of an ancient gondwana fauna, their subfamily gecarcinucinae, and probably also the liotelphusinae, evolved on the indian subcontinent and subsequently dispersed to southeast asia. estimated by a model testing approach, this dispersal event took place during the middle eocene, and thus before the final collision of india and the tibet-part of eurasia.


CONCLUSIONS
we postulate that the india and southeast asia were close enough for exchange of freshwater organisms during the middle eocene, before the final indian-eurasian collision. our data support geological models that assume the indian plate having tracked along southeast asia during its move northwards.
