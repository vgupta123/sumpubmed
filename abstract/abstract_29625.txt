BACKGROUND
nlrc <dig> is a member of the card domain containing, nucleotide-binding oligomerization -like receptor  family, which recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns  and initiates an innate immune response leading to inflammation and/or cell death. however, the specific role of nlrc <dig> as a modulator of the inflammatory immune response remains controversial. it has been reported to be a mediator of type i ifns, nf-kb, and mhc class i gene. but no study on nlrc <dig> function has been reported to date in chickens. in the current study, we investigated the role of nlrc <dig> in the regulation of ifna, ifnb, il- <dig>  and mhc class i in the chicken hd <dig> macrophage cell line, by using rnai technology. hd <dig> cells were transfected with one of five sirnas . after  <dig> hours, cells were exposed to lps or poly  or a vehicle control. gene expression of nlrc <dig>  ifna, ifnb, il- <dig>  and mhc class i at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours post stimulation  was quantified by qpcr.


RESULTS
the expression of nlrc <dig>  ifna, ifnb, and il- <dig> genes in negative irrelevant transfection controls was up-regulated at  <dig> hps after lps treatment compared to the vehicle controls. s3-sirna effectively knocked down nlrc <dig> expression at  <dig> hps, and the expression of ifna and ifnb  was also down-regulated at  <dig> hps in s3-sirna transfected cells, compared to negative irrelevant transfection controls. stimulation by lps appeared to relatively restore the decrease in nlrc <dig>  ifna, and ifnb expression, but the difference is not significant.


CONCLUSIONS
functional characterization of chicken nlrc <dig> in an in vitro system demonstrated its importance in regulating intracellular molecules involved in inflammatory response. the knockdown of nlrc <dig> expression negatively mediates gene expression of ifna and ifnb in the chicken hd <dig> cell line; therefore, nlrc <dig> likely has a role in positive regulation of ifna and ifnb expression. no direct relationship was found between nlrc <dig> knockdown and il- <dig> and mhc class i expression. future studies will further clarify the roles of nlrc <dig> and other nlrs in infectious diseases of chickens and may increase the efficacy of antiviral vaccine design.
