BACKGROUND
the relaxin-like peptide family belongs in the insulin superfamily and consists of  <dig> peptides of high structural but low sequence similarity; relaxin- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and the insulin-like  peptides, insl <dig>  insl <dig>  insl <dig> and insl <dig>  the functions of relaxin- <dig>  insl <dig>  insl <dig>  insl <dig> remain uncharacterised. the evolution of this family has been contentious; high sequence variability is seen between closely related species, while distantly related species show high similarity; an invertebrate relaxin sequence has been reported, while a relaxin gene has not been found in the avian and ruminant lineages.


RESULTS
sequence similarity searches of genomic and est data identified homologs of relaxin-like peptides in mammals, and non-mammalian vertebrates such as fish. phylogenetic analysis was used to resolve the evolution of the family. searches were unable to identify an invertebrate relaxin-like peptide. the published relaxin cdna sequence in the tunicate, ciona intestinalis was not present in the completed c. intestinalis genome. the newly discovered relaxin- <dig> is likely to be the ancestral relaxin. multiple relaxin-3-like sequences are present in fugu fish  and zebrafish , but these appear to be specific to the fish lineage. possible relaxin- <dig> and insl <dig> homologs were also identified in fish and frog species, placing their emergence prior to mammalia, earlier than previously believed. furthermore, estimates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates  suggest that the emergence of relaxin- <dig>  insl <dig> and insl <dig> during mammalia was driven by positive darwinian selection, hence these peptides are likely to have novel and in the case of relaxin- <dig>  which is still under positive selection in humans and the great apes, possibly still evolving functions. in contrast, relaxin- <dig> is constrained by strong purifying selection, demonstrating it must have a highly conserved function, supporting its hypothesized important neuropeptide role.


CONCLUSIONS
we present a phylogeny describing the evolutionary history of the relaxin-like peptide family and show that positive selection has driven the evolution of the most recent members of the family.
