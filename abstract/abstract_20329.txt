BACKGROUND
microbial degradation of azo dyes is commonly initiated by the reduction of the azo bond by a group of nadh or nadph dependant azoreductases with many requiring flavin as a cofactor. in this study, we report the identification of a novel flavin-free nadph preferred azoreductase encoded by azob in pigmentiphaga kullae k <dig> 


RESULTS
the deduced amino acid sequence of azob from p. kullae k <dig> showed 61% identity to a previously studied azoreductase  from the same strain. azob encoded a protein of  <dig> amino acids and heterologously expressed in escherichia coli. the purified recombinant enzyme was a monomer with a molecular mass of  <dig> kda. both nadh and nadph can be used as an electron donor for its activity with 4- benzenesulfonic acid  as substrate. the apparent km values for both nadh and orange i were  <dig> and  <dig>  μm, respectively. the km of nadph for the enzyme is  <dig>  μm. when nadph served as the electron donor, the activity of the enzyme is 63% higher than that when nadh was used. the ph and temperature optima for activity of the enzyme with orange i as the substrate were at ph  <dig>  and between  <dig> and 45°c. phylogenetic analysis shows that azob belongs to the flavin-free azoreductase group which has a key fingerprint motif gxxgxxg for nadh binding at the n-terminus of the amino acid sequences. the 3d structure of azob was generated by comparative modeling approach. the structural combination of three conserved glycine residues  in the pyrophosphate-binding loop with the arg- <dig> explains the preference for nadph of azob.


CONCLUSIONS
the biochemical and structural properties of azob from p. kullae k <dig> revealed its preference for nadph over nadh and it is a member of the monomeric flavin-free azoreductase group. our studies show the substrate specificity of azob based on structure and cofactor requirement and the phylogenetic relationship among azoreductase groups.
