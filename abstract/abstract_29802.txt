BACKGROUND
microtubule-associated protein tau  is a neuronal protein involved in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including parkinson’s disease . glycogen synthase kinase  <dig> beta  catalyzes phosphorylation in multiple sites of tau protein. however, whether or not there is any association between the gsk3b gene alteration, mapt haplotype and pd remains unexplored in chinese population, especially in central chinese population.


RESULTS
here, we aimed at studying the effect of mapt rs <dig> and gsk3b rs <dig> on the risk of pd by performing a case-control association study in central china. our data showed that all pd patients and controls were of mapt h1/h <dig> diplotype in our study, thus confirming that the distribution of the mapt h <dig> haplotype is common in china. gg genotype of mapt rs <dig> serves protection effect on pd risk in central chinese population, while genotype of gsk3b rs <dig> showed no difference between pd patients and controls.


CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the mapt rs <dig> is associated with pd in central china in the background of mapt h1/h <dig> diplotype. the gg genotype of rs <dig> displays protection against pd in subgroup with gsk3b rs <dig> t carrier.
