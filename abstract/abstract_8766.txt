BACKGROUND
in rat, deafferentation of one labyrinth  results in a characteristic syndrome of ocular and motor postural disorders . behavioral recovery , encompassing  <dig> week after unilateral labyrinthectomy, has been termed vestibular compensation. evidence suggesting that the histamine h <dig> receptor plays a key role in vestibular compensation comes from studies indicating that betahistine, a histamine-like drug that acts as both a partial histamine h <dig> receptor agonist and an h <dig> receptor antagonist, can accelerate the process of vestibular compensation.


RESULTS
expression levels for histamine h <dig> receptor  as well as three isoforms which display variable lengths of the third intracellular loop of the receptor were analyzed using in situ hybridization on brain sections containing the rat medial vestibular nucleus after unilateral labyrinthectomy. we compared these expression levels to h <dig> receptor binding densities.

total h <dig> receptor mrna levels  as well as mrna levels of the three receptor isoforms studied  showed a pattern of increase, which was bilaterally significant at  <dig> h post-lesion for both h3x and h3c, followed by significant bilateral decreases in medial vestibular nuclei occurring  <dig> h  and  <dig> week post-lesion . expression levels of h3b was an exception to the forementioned pattern with significant decreases already detected at  <dig> h post-lesion. coinciding with the decreasing trends in h <dig> receptor mrna levels was an observed increase in h <dig> receptor binding densities occurring in the ipsilateral medial vestibular nuclei  <dig> h post-lesion.


CONCLUSIONS
progressive recovery of the resting discharge of the deafferentated medial vestibular nuclei neurons results in functional restoration of the static postural and occulomotor deficits, usually occurring within a time frame of  <dig> hours in rats. our data suggests that the h <dig> receptor may be an essential part of pre-synaptic mechanisms required for reestablishing resting activities  <dig> h after unilateral labyrinthectomy.
