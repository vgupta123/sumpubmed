BACKGROUND
hypodontus macropi is a common intestinal nematode of a range of kangaroos and wallabies . based on previous multilocus enzyme electrophoresis  and nuclear ribosomal dna sequence data sets, h. macropi has been proposed to be complex of species. to test this proposal using independent molecular data, we sequenced the whole mitochondrial  genomes of individuals of h. macropi from three different species of hosts  as well as that of macropicola ocydromi , and undertook a comparative analysis of the amino acid sequence datasets derived from these genomes.


RESULTS
the mt genomes sequenced by next-generation  technology from h. macropi from the three host species varied from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp in size. pairwise comparisons of the amino acid sequences predicted from these three mt genomes revealed differences of  <dig> % to 18%. phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence data sets using bayesian inference  showed that h. macropi from the three different host species formed distinct, well-supported clades. in addition, sliding window analysis of the mt genomes defined variable regions for future population genetic studies of h. macropi in different macropodid hosts and geographical regions around australia.


CONCLUSIONS
the present analyses of inferred mt protein sequence datasets clearly supported the hypothesis that h. macropi from m. robustus robustus, m. bicolor and t. billardierii represent distinct species.
