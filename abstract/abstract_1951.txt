BACKGROUND
compared to other ascomycetes, the barley powdery mildew pathogen blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei  has a large genome  that harbors a relatively small number of protein-coding genes . this genomic assemblage is thought to be the result of numerous gene losses, which likely represent an evolutionary adaptation to a parasitic lifestyle in close association with its host plant, barley . approximately 8% of the bgh genes are predicted to encode virulence effectors that are secreted into host tissue and/or cells to promote pathogenesis; the remaining proteome is largely uncharacterized at present.


RESULTS
we provide a comparative analysis of the conceptual bgh proteome, with an emphasis on proteins with known roles in fungal development and pathogenicity, for example heterotrimeric g proteins and g protein coupled receptors; components of calcium and camp signaling; small monomeric gtpases; mitogen-activated protein cascades and transcription factors. the predicted bgh proteome lacks a number of proteins that are otherwise conserved in filamentous fungi, including two proteins that are required for the formation of anastomoses . by contrast, apart from minor modifications, all major canonical signaling pathways are retained in bgh. a family of kinases that preferentially occur in pathogenic species of the fungal clade leotiomyceta is unusually expanded in bgh and its close relative, blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici.


CONCLUSIONS
our analysis reveals characteristic features of the proteome of a fungal phytopathogen that occupies an extreme habitat: the living plant cell.
