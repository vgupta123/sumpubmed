BACKGROUND
formins are a highly conserved family of cytoskeletal remodeling proteins. a growing body of evidence suggests that formins play key roles in the progression and spread of a variety of cancers. there are  <dig> human formin proteins and of these the diaphanous-related formins  are the best characterized. included in the drfs are the formin-like proteins, fmnl <dig>   <dig> &  <dig>  each of which have been strongly implicated in driving tumorigenesis and metastasis of specific tumors. in particular, increased fmnl <dig> expression correlates with increased invasiveness of colorectal cancer  in vivo and for a variety of crc cell-lines in vitro. fmnl <dig> expression is also required for invasive cell motility in other cancer cell-lines. there are multiple alternatively spliced isoforms of fmnl <dig> and it is predicted that the encoded proteins will differ in their regulation, subcellular localization and in their ability to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics.


RESULTS
using rt-pcr we identified four fmnl <dig> isoforms expressed in crc and melanoma cell-lines. we find that a previously uncharacterized fmnl <dig> isoform is predominantly expressed in a variety of melanoma and crc cell lines; this isoform is also more effective in driving 3d motility. building on previous reports, we also show that fmnl <dig> is required for invasion in a <dig> and wm <dig>  melanoma cells.


CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these results suggest that fmnl <dig> is likely to be generally required in melanoma cells for invasion, that a specific isoform of fmnl <dig> is up-regulated in invasive crc and melanoma cells and this isoform is the most effective at facilitating invasion.
