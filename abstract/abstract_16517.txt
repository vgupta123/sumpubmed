BACKGROUND
the whole-cell lipase from burkholderia cepacia has been used as a biocatalyst in organic synthesis. however, there is no report in the literature on the component or the gene sequence of the cell-bound lipase from this species. qualitative analysis of the cell-bound lipase would help to illuminate the regulation mechanism of gene expression and further improve the yield of the cell-bound lipase by gene engineering.


RESULTS
three predictive cell-bound lipases, lipa, lipc <dig> and lipc <dig>  from burkholderia sp. zyb <dig> were cloned and expressed in e. coli. both lipa and lipc <dig> displayed the lipase activity. lipc <dig> was a novel mesophilic enzyme and displayed preference for medium-chain-length acyl groups . the 3d structural model of lipc <dig> revealed the open y-type active site. lipa displayed 96 % amino acid sequence identity with the known extracellular lipase. lipa-inactivation and lipc24-inactivation decreased the total cell-bound lipase activity of burkholderia sp. zyb <dig> by 42 % and 14 %, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
the cell-bound lipase activity from burkholderia sp. zyb <dig> originated from a multi-enzyme mixture with lipa as the main component. lipc <dig> was a novel lipase and displayed different enzymatic characteristics and structural model with lipa. besides lipa and lipc <dig>  other type of the cell-bound lipases  should exist.
